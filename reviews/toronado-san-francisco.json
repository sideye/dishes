The beer offerings were great, with a huge taplist that included some rarer beers that we hadn't tried before. They even had a Founders beer that we had to look up because we hadn't heard of it (and we live in Grand Rapids, where Founders was ... founded)! When we stopped in on a weekday afternoon there was a small crowd at the bar and a couple of dogs hanging out. The guy checking our IDs was polite and the bartender was patient when we were browsing the options. Prices were beyond reasonable and probably even cheap for this area.\n\nToronado is cash-only and they don't have any food, but it's definitely worth a stop if you're a craft beer lover. We would have gone in again but unfortunately didn't end up having enough time during our stay. Until next time, Toronado!", "author": "Katy C."}

New brews tried:\n\n- Mad River John Barleycorn Barleywine-Style Ale 2017.  Approximately 10% ABV.  Clear copper, one-finger head, lacing the glass.  Mild caramel malt nose.  Taste is caramel malt, peach, and ethanol, with some bitterness in the finish. \n\n- Tioga-Sequoia Bourbon-Barrel-Aged Vanilla Midnight Lightning.   13.6% ABV.  Opaque black, cream-colored halo head.  Nose reminiscent of cream soda.  Intense taste of sweet roast malt, chocolate, dark fruit, and ethanol. Aged in Stranahan whiskey barrels, with vanilla beans.\n\n- Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Barrel Stout.  6.9% ABV, rather low for the style; 14 IBU.  Opaque dark brown; one-finger head.  Winy, grape-y nose.  Fizzy, with a rather thin mouth feel.  Chocolate note, but I couldn't identify much Wild Turkey presence.  Moderately boozy.  Lightly hopped with Columbus and Northern Brewer.  A barrel-aged version of Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout. \n\nOh, and mark your calendar:  Toronado's annual Barleywine Festival opens on November 13 this year.", "author": "Alan F."}

I always wondered where the rude bartenders mentioned in the yelp reviews were hiding until my last experience here.\n    Long story short, after being screamed at and threatened by the bar owner and bouncer for taking a photo, we were made so uncomfortable that we left our untouched drinks on the bar and left... mind you, we weren't taking photos of any faces and there was not a single \"no cameras\" sign to be found.\n     Great beer selection though and obviously one shouldn't expect five-star service in a dive bar, but I think that being rude and unkind to paying customers anywhere is just unacceptable... we definitely won't be back.", "author": "Milan F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-24", "description": "Brass-Tacks:  If you want to have as good of a beer list at your disposal that you will find in San Francisco, you better take note of Toronado.  By my count, they typically have about 50 beers on tap here, and I can always find at least 5 to 10 beers that I want to try on any given visit.  And, their prices are good and their pours are never of the sampler-sized variety.  I haven't even touched bottles here, if they even have them.  Oh yeah, it's also open around noon.  So, this place would slide to magical 6-star for beer if such a thing were possible.\n\nNow, folks....  There are 1, 2 and 3-star reviews.  My first question is:  What did you think this place was when you walked in?  It's beer first, and, frankly, nothing second.  And, let's be real, if you think you can find this stuff anywhere, then go show us how it's done.  There are a lot of good beer places in SF but you won't find this range on tap with these prices.  So, expect to be on their program.  And, that means, be here on purpose - and on purpose means you get how good the beer you have access to is and you actually really appreciate it.  Want your ass kissed and told that you are special because you have plenty of money to waste on beer you don't like, understand or care about, you can go waste your money plenty of other places.  No one is here to hold your hand.  And, your spot at the bar is damn valuable.  For $20 I can pick you three beers here that you a) Won't find on a tap list that day, and b) Are REALLY good and would give you three different distinct takes on the craft.  These will be full beers.  There's no sitting at the bar while the beer drinker in your group finishes their beer.  Get your own.  Finished it, get another.  Gonna get one later, now is as good as later.  Not using your seat, I'll take it.  Those are the people who write low-rated reviews.  They are people who don't realize where they are.  These are the same people that show up at art galleries and say \"I could do that.\"  They don't get what goes into actually making it.  Walk into an art gallery and they kiss your ass, their art likely sucks.\n\nSo, yes, the beer is really good here.  And, I respect their service.  If you stay long enough and show enough of your true colors, they do open up.  You'll also realized that there are a lot of tips to be gained and there are some awesome people to meet at this bar if you are looking to get to know the real movers and shakers and super-stars of Bay Area Beer.  And, I like the fact that they don't cater to pretension and non-sense.  I would only walk in here being ready to be on the top of my beer-drinking game.  I recommend having a good beer APP at your disposal because one thing they don't do it list out style and ABV, which a lot of the 20-30 tap places do on an electronic board.  If you have a certain style (I mean, for real, not like... Strong) you can get some good suggestions as you go through your session, especially if you are a few deep and you didn't start by ordering a Stella.  (no Stella?!?!  what else is like Stella?!?! ... ...)  They aren't mean here.  They just do not have tolerance for annoying hindrances to being one of the best beer bars you will find anywhere.  \n\nIf you do this the right way, you will put this on your life list of really good beer bars.  You will drink good beer.  You will meet cool people who are really into beer.  And, while this place doesn't serve food, you can also get some awesome Rosamunde Sausage, Mystic Pizza or my favorite Mock Duck sandwich from Love 'N Haight Deli and bring it in to eat.  You can also pay a visit to another great beer bar, Noc Noc, which is a trip and is close by.  But, I digress in taking attention of the super-star here, which is Toronado.  It's all about the beer.  Beer first, and nothing second.\n\nWell done!", "author": "Adam S."}

As I wasn't a beer nerd back then I remember trying to avoid Toronado whenever we had our pub crawls because for one it was an overly-crowded dive bar, and back when I had no idea what good beer tasted like, this bar was just filled with beers I'd never even heard of and charging way too much for a pint.\n\nFast-forward a few years and a couple thousand beers later, I visited Toronado during the daytime around four after having drinks earlier that day at City Beer and Cellarmaker. Whereas they didn't have anything too impressive pouring on tap that day (they had a sign up that said \"Pliny the Elder is not on tap today\") I did see a myriad of rare bottles (including the previously mentioned Pliny) on the bottle list, and then it struck me that a week ago was Cable Car week. Whereas I had heard rumors that Toronado was cracking open verticals of  Cable Car during their event, it didn't cross my mind until I was about two beers in, that they could probably still have some bottles left.\n\n$40 and about 45 minutes later, I left happy having hogged a bottle of Lost Abbey's Cable Car Ale all to myself.\n\nPersonal anecdotes and bragging aside, Toronado has a huge rotating tap selection and an even bigger bottle menu; whereas they don't serve food you can always bring in food from either Rosamunde next door or Ali Baba's. The service is what you expect from a dive bar, but the bartender was nice enough to humor me and my questions about the place while I was drinking. Cash only isn't all that bad as they do have an ATM machine on premises.", "author": "Scott S."}

The potential that Toronado has is fantastic but the way that they squander it is akin to the lottery winners who wind up bankrupt after a few years. Such wasted potential.\n\nYou walk in, it's your typical dive/beer bar. They're my favorite and I've been to many. Rock music, stickers and graffiti on the walls and a (genuinely) great selection of beers. Then you notice the side-eye the bartender is giving you for no reason. You walk up to the bar and the bartenders treat you like shit, aren't interested in answering any questions and if you look even remotely not like them physically, they dismiss you. The irony of all of this is that the tough-guy bartender vibe that they put out is just as pretentious and douchey as the SF tech bros that they so loathe here.

I know fully well that we ordered at the same time and the beer came from the same tap, but I just wanted to make sure. Maybe it's the psychology part of it, the beer did taste a little flat after my friend mentioned it. Full disclosure, I'm not sure at all if the beer was tasting more flat than normal. As a result, I asked the bartender that happened to be walking past me that if there beer was a little flat. I said: \"I'm not sure if it's me but does this beer taste a little flat?\". To which the bartender responded \"it's not the beer, your palette is wrong\". Frankly I wasn't expect top of the line customer service, however I am a little appalled that the bartender's first response was neither asking for what beer I got nor test tasting from the tap, but to accuse me of genetic defect. Maybe the bartender should've applied to med school, and I'm sure he would've aced his mcat.\n\n**Edit**\nRight after writing this I witnessed the bouncer sitting right by to the entrance smoking(violating the law which require smoking to be take place certain distance from entrances and vents) flick a cigarette to the car parked in front, creating a fabulous spark on the car.

I fire up the rental car, sit in mega traffic, and go nuts trying to find parking (I'm from Florida, we don't have this parking issue).  \n\nOnce inside, this place is exactly as I expected.

When we get there, (strangely enough) the front door guy checking IDs was very nice and even cracked a joke with us. Which I think might be why we were all so shocked as to what happened inside.\n\nWe go up to the bar, it's fairly crowded (it's a Saturday night, after all). We all decided what we wanted right as we got in so we wouldn't hold anyone up. My friend goes up to the bar to place our orders - one beer for him, another kind for my boyfriend, and the pomegranate cider for me.\n\nThe bartender begrudgingly takes the order, but apparently doesn't hear my friend order the second beer. My cider comes up first and then the first beer comes right after. My friend hands me my cider and then asks the bartender which beer it is that he was just handed. Because the bartender didn't hear the second beer order, he looks my friend straight in the face and says \"Take a f***ing sip of it. Does it taste like cider or a f***ing beer?\"\n\nWOW. Because of a slight miscommunication, Mister Bartender gets his panties in a bunch and decides to cuss at customer. Unbelievable (but actually kind of believable after reading other reviews).\n\nThis place isn't Dick's Last Resort. It's shtick is not to have staff who are complete assholes to customers and have no regards for other people. To the bartender who looks like a cross between a wanna be Hells Angel and one of Snow White's seven dwarves, go work somewhere where you don't have to interact with people.\n\nWhile this place has a good beer selection, the lack of polite (or at least tolerant) staff merits it less than a star.", "author": "Tressa R."}

This is for beer geeks, by beer geeks.  If you don't already have an obsessive knowledge of styles and brands, then you may have a bad time. \n\nYou are not a unique snowflake that needs a personalized recommendation.  You know why?\n\nBECAUSE ALL THE FREAKING BEER IS GOOD.  \nWhy would they have such a good reputation as one of the best beer bars in a beer crazy city, even after all these years? Because they do not put beers they think are bad on tap! \nLive a little! Pick a beer at random! Most beers on the board have the style listed with them.  Typically, their list is skewed towards Belgians, sours, and limited run/lesser known beers from local breweries. They always have at least two or three IPAs, so all the dude bros won't get too scared.\n\nHow to have a positive ordering experience:\nWhen you arrive, stare at the board till your eyes fall out.  Before you make eye contact, or hell, even angle your body towards the bar, know what the fuck you want.  Only then should you stand politely yet firmly with your eyes ready to make contact and order.  Do not talk to your friends. Do not keep looking at the board.  Don't look at your phone. Do not raise your hand.  They see you, trust me.\nJust wait. Like a person.\nHave the cash in your hand ready to go. Yell your order then put a please on the end.  You will be rewarded with a beer! Then tip!\n\nYes, it's crowded as balls on Friday and Saturday. I live a few blocks away and I don't even think about going on a weekend.  (That's what NocNoc is for)\nYes, it's a loud crowded neighborhood bar.  It does smell a bit sometimes.  There are often unsavory characters.  It's a REAL dive bar. The beer is worth it, I think.\n\nIf none of the above sounds like your bag, go to The Monk's Kettle.  They are also an excellent bar but it's much more friendly for people who can't get their act together (or want this \"service\" you speak of).

The Toronado is an iconic legend in beer-geek circles, a prime mover that has been at the forefront of the craft beer revolution over the past couple decades. I had to make my pilgrimage. \n\nLike many of the nation's best beer bars, it's a little crusty. It has been on Haight St. for 24 years, and looks the part. It's hard to imagine that the first time I came to San Francisco, in 1989, I walked right by this bar when it was in its first year of operation. Of course, I didn't know what I was looking at, and wasn't old enough to drink, anyway. Point is, this place has some mileage on the odometer, and was probably dive-y to begin with - so don't expect some sparkling, yuppiefied, Yard House/World of Beer-type tavern. No matter. You're here to drink beer. You're not here to see and be seen. You're not here to pick up girls. If you're a woman, maybe you could come here to pick up dudes, but you run the risk that some of them may be more interested in their beers than they are you. \n\nHey, I get it. When I'm drinking a Lost Abbey Cable Car (a rather rare, expensive sour beer brewed specifically for the Toronado), I don't want to be distracted. Upon seeing it on the menu, I was beside myself with excitement. But then I tempered my expectations, figuring they probably wouldn't have it. After draining a Pliny the Elder (because if you come to the Toronado from out of state, you *have* to drink a Pliny), I went up to the bar to try to order my Cable Car, bracing myself for disappointment...but none was forthcoming. Instead, the pearly gates parted, and the bartender produced the coveted 750ml bottle, and two tulip glasses. It just doesn't get much better than that. Sure, Cable Car isn't cheap beer by anyone's standards, but the experience was well worth it. \n\nAs tough as it is to follow Cable Car, we did so with New Belgium's La Folie, another perennial favorite sour beer that can't be had where I come from. \n\nThis place has a reputation for gruff, snarky service, but I didn't see any of it. For what it's worth, I thought the bartenders I interacted with were pretty cool. The bar felt comfortable to me, very much like some favorite beer bars in my home state. I think that generally, if you can speak a bit of the language of beer, you're fine. That also implies, don't act like an entitled jerk-off, or ask stupid questions like \"what's the closest thing you have to Bud Light?\" For that matter, I probably wouldn't try to order a Bud Light here, unless I was trying to be funny.

If you are looking for a corona or heineken, you've come to the wrong place .. Toronado is too good for that! I am all about the IPAs, so I've tried quite a few of them here. My favorite and must-get-everytime beer is Pliny the Elder straight from the Russian River. This is probably the tastiest and smoothest IPA I've ever had! Whats special about Toronado is that they have Pliny on tap! Other places I've checked out have them by the bottles only. Try other beers like Damnation and Death & Taxes as well! They have sour beers too if you're into that. \n\nThere are pizza and wings you can grab at nearby restaurants. The tamale lady comes in around 11-12 and sells pork/chicken/beef tamales for $5.

Because everything pretty much sucked.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nSo here was my debate:  I'd already been traveling around all day by myself around San Francisco and was back at the hotel to change and get some much needed re-charging of my iPhone.  I was tired and cold.  Watching March Madness from the comfort of my warm hotel bed had me tempted to skip out on my night plans, which happened to be Toronado.  But I'd heard it was possibly the best beer bar in the city, so I decided to give in and head over.\n\nAfter a decent trek through the city, I arrived at a crowded bar with no open seats and squeezed my way to the bar.  I am no beer expert by any stretch of the imagination...so when walking into a bar with 50+ beers that I have never heard of and know nothing about...is it abnormal for a question or two to be asked?  I asked bartender #1 for a Belgium style beer that wasn't too hoppy and was given the answer, \"Belgium is just a country, that could mean a lot of things.\"  \n\nWell, why is it that when I go to any other bar across America with a similar question, the bartender immediately has a suggestion or three for me?  Eventually I got something and slipped away from the bar.\n\nFinally a couple of guys left and two bar stools opened up.  I took one and was ready for beer #2, this time, from bartender #2.  I had been reading my Yelp app for suggestions, but then leaned my hand down on the bar, as I was checking out the taps to see what seemed appealing.  Bartender #2 comes up and asks - what I would like: \n\nMe:  \"Can I try this?\" as I point to a tab.  \n\nHim (snarky tone) \"do you want to SAMPLE or do you want to DRINK it?\" \n\nMe: \"ummm I want to samp...\" as he cuts me off.  \n\nHim: \"Do you want to drink or do you want to be on your phone?\"  \n\nMe: \"Huh??\"\n\nHim: \"Put your phone away if you want to order\"  *looks around at the other patrons for someone to agree with him...\n\nMe: \"I am not even looking at my phone, it's dimmed, what are you talking about?\"\n\nHe then hands me my \"sample\" which is awful, so I quickly choose something else, drink it, close my tab, and depart never to return.\n\nI understand that they were busy, but they were in no way \"slammed.\"  It was the most rude and least helpful bar service I've ever had, and my worst experience at any place in San Francisco.", "author": "Brett N."}

I personally did not have a bad experience with the service either and we were here on a Friday night.\nWhy I gave this place a 1 star rating is due to the smell and cleanliness or lack thereof.  I know this is a dive bar and love dive bars.  This place reeked worse that Bourbon Street in New Orleans does before they was it down.  We looked past that and went ahead and ordered a beer.  Then I had to use the restroom.  Ladies beware.  These are unisex bathrooms and the boys there like to pee all over the place and leave the seat up.

The San Diego venue is 4 stars, and could teach a lot to the staff at SF about running a bar.  Hard to believe it's the same owner?  Anyway, to describe the Toronado SF experience - you walk in after driving around looking for a place to park for 20 minutes and finding a spot a 6 block hike away.  Yes, it's to be expected that parking will suck on Haight Street, but it is part of the experience.  I have actually planned a Haight Street pub crawl and parked 2 miles away and taken the Ol Reliable 22 bus to Haight and Divisidero.  Anyway, as you walk in after your trek, the first thing you notice is the smell.  Stale beer.  The place needs a good airing out and a deep bleaching.  Next, the clientele.  I thought the sausage place was next door....This place looks like a casting call for a live action version of a Simpsons comic store scene.  More than a couple big guys on barstools showing a lot of ass crack.  The service, while not as surly as some have reported, could definitely use some help also - maybe some of us need a little help ordering.  Sorry we don't have your breadth of experience in shitty Bakersfield craft brew offerings.  The beer selection is extensive, of course heavily weighted to west coast craft breweries, with one or two Europeans. I would show more diversity, personally, but you kinda know what you are getting into walking in.  Plenty of German restaurants and English/Irish pubs in SF if I want something with a little more history.  The beers I ordered were excellent, but the overall scuzziness of the place made me a little leery of their glassware.  Anyway, finally, the bathroom.

But the bartenders and attitude of the Toronado completely overshadow the beer selection, and while I've given the place many chances over the years, I believe I am finally ready to move on from the Toronado.\n\nThe Toronado has always had a reputation for having rude bartenders, and I've seen first-hand evidence of this on a few occasions myself, but last Thursday I witnessed one that spoke volumes about the way the bar treats its patrons.\n\nA group of 4 entered the bar while I was having a beer with a friend. They went to the bar to order a beer, and when I noticed them again 15-20 min later they were still at the bar, just receiving their drinks from the bartender. Then suddenly the bartender started shouting at them and telling them they had to leave. Apparently, one of the people in their group had sat down to reserve a table while they waited for their beers, and the bartender claimed that that person had fallen asleep, and that he and his group had to leave the bar immediately. No warnings or second chances. Just time to go. The bartender grabbed the barely touched beers back from his friends and aggressively escorted them all out of the bar. From where I was sitting, the whole incident looked like it was blown wayyyyy out of proportion by the bartender, and the fact that the friends who had paid for their beers and had done nothing wrong had their drinks taken from them seems completely unreasonable. \n\nBut this type of situation seems pretty par for the course with the Toronado, from what I've heard from others.

First time, never been here, haven't even heard of it.  All Mr. MC told me was that it was a dive bar. Um...dive bar? Not too sure about those..especially with a bunch of guys.\n\nIf you have never been here, let me tell you, street parking only. You gotta get lucky! Which I did. With sharp eyes and some luck, you'll find a street parking within 5 minutes.  We walked over to the front and was greeted by the bouncer.  Very chill guy.  THIS BAR WAS PACKED.  Pretty damn packed for a dive bar.  Not sure what to order? Just look up towards the beer list and pick a name that interests you, or you can simply go with Hefenweizen, can never go wrong, right?\n\nAll beers are around $5-6.  IPAs, amber ale, lighter stouts, whatever you want.  If you don't want to piss off the bartender, make sure you know what you want before ordering.  The bartender we ordered from didn't like walking twice back and forth.  So order everything at once.  \n\nPlenty of tables for a small dive bar.  However, we arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night and there were barely any space to stand.  \n\n3 individual bathrooms. CASH ONLY. LOUD atmosphere. A variety of BEERS ON TAP. Bring a couple friends and have a great night.", "author": "Stephy L."}

They will not hesitant to strike up a conversation with you at the bar or recommend their favorites. There is a TV so you can catch up on the game and other big action that is happening and the menu is pretty self explanatory although you may have a hard time trying to figure out how to pronounce most of it.\n\nThey are CASH ONLY just like the sausage spot next door, but it's well worth your cold hard green backs for a refreshing taste of something out of the ordinary.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

Aside from the great selection of beers, I also love their happy hour (a dollar off of their already very reasonably priced selections) and their proximity to Rosamunde (another absolute favorite).\n\nCan it be loud or crowded? Certainly (at least at times), but its the sound of people having a great time (maybe scored by Motorhead). Also, I will go on the record that their bartenders are lovely people (in addition to being excellent at their jobs). Is the bar packed three deep?

The reason I gave this place ANY stars is for their amazing beer selection.  It is effectively the best draft selection in the city.  The fact that you can bring food in, ie Rosamunde, is nice too.  Kudos to the owners and/or managers for providing such a diverse and eclectic beer selection - provided they are not the same degenerates that work the bar or the door.  \n\nI live two blocks away, and the time between my visits grows after every time I show my face and have a similar experience.  The beer is good, but certainly nowhere near good enough for me to tolerate the rudeness which has become the status quo.   What's worse, the folks that work here think the attitude is \"cool\" and serves them well.  It's unfortunate, this is a popular neighborhood spot that I would visit more often if they did not treat their customers with such disdain; I have never gotten the sense that my patronage at Toronado is appreciated. \n\nI grew up in this neighborhood and have lived in close proximity to the Lower Haight for more than two decades.  As a result, I tend to laugh at the pretension that so many tatted up transplants seem to incorporate into their mannerisms.  It's comical to me that I get shoved by a bouncer for picking up a stool to bring to a table to join my friends.  It's hysterical that the bartender feels the need to pick on my girlfriend because she's not a beer expert and does not know what to order.  It's laughable that the ten seconds it took me to find an extra couple bucks in order to tip is met with a sideways stare and a roll of the eyes.  \n\nAll in all, this is a place I would go more often if the bartenders and bouncer did not convey a sense of entitlement.

The first beer we had to try was the 2010 Lost Abbey Cable Car. I never had Pliny the Elder on tap, so I had to have one to compare it from the bottled ones. They even had Dogfish Head Worldwide which is impossible to find. We ended up buying all 7 bottles that they had left. We ended up trying and buying other beers because it was just too hard to find anywhere else.\n\nThe people and staff were great here and I couldn't ask for anything more. There was no trouble from customers as all were just there to have a good time. The workers kept our table clean and kept us entertained and never had us waiting long even though it was jam packed.

Boy was I wrong.  The placed was completely packed with everyone trying to get their hands on Pliny the Younger.

Don't bother calling the bar to see if they have Pliny the Younger available.  You would have a better chance at winning the lotto then to have someone pick up during SF beer week.  Besides, it's a dive bar.  I am not going there for their awesome customer service.  I am there because of their awesome selection of draft beers. \n\n2.  Arrive before the bar opens to increase your chances at getting this beer. The bar opens at 11:30 am every day.  They tapped out of Pliny the Younger for the day in 43 minutes while I was there that day.\n\n3. Everyone is trying to get the attention of the two bartenders. You need to be more vocal about getting their attentions to get the beer.  I mean nicely, not be an ass.  I saw people being nice and patient waiting for the bartenders only to get shafted by other customers who were more vocal and aggressive. \n\n4. Don't be a dope and order just one for yourself. I have seen others order two at a time for themselves and have done it for myself.  The chances of you going back into that line to get the beer can be difficult. I brought another friend who wasn't that into IPA's and was able to utilize their services and acquired two additional Younger's. \n\nBonus - Foo Fighter's All My Life randomly came on during beer consumption.

What I usually do is come here either before or after my other favorite establishment in San Francisco, Zeitgeist, as the two bars are only about a 15 minute walk apart.\n\nAs a hop-head if I can walk into a bar see Pliny on the wall and still order something else, that is a very good sign.   Last time I went about a month ago I ordered a Boneyard Nefarious and an El Toro Deuce IPA.  The Nefarious is a strong (10% abv) and well balanced Double IPA that comes in a Tulip glass, despite the light citrus notes I found the carmel maltiness to be a little too dominant. The El Toro Deuce Imperial IPA had a heavy body and I did not enjoy it as much as the Nefarious as it was even more malty and sweet.  Looking back I probably would have been happier getting a Pliny or Blind Pig, but if you don't try something new you won't ever truly know you palette.\n\nOk back to Toronado as an establishment.  It has your typical craft beer bar decor and there is an extra room in the back with additional seating, where the music is not as loud (as chosen on the jukebox near the rear of the bar).  The bartenders are typically busy so be prepared to say what you want from the board and have your cash in hand (this is a cash only establishment).  You don't come here for the service or conversation with the bartender, you come here for the beer.  That being said my wife and I came here on a week night last time and we were able to ask a few questions about the beers on the board to help us decide what we wanted to order.  \n\nOne last tip, go next door to Rosamunde Sausage Grill and get yourself something to pair with your beverage.", "author": "Charlie M."}

Once my craft beer obsessed husband showed me, his craft beer obsessed wife, the draft and bottle list, our eyes lit up. When an friends art show happened to be coming up in the city, we didn't hesitate. It also happeed to be SF beer week the weekend we decided to hit up the city. Although we came in at the tail end of it, we still got to see a decent amount of great stuff.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the place was packed. Well, what we thought at the time was packed. There were no free tables or bar stools. The draft list was wiped out. And it was barley wine day. We almost felt like bolting. But, we decided to stick it out and ordered a beer while standing. Once I finished my Belgian and my husband his Pliny the Elder, a bar stool opened up and we snagged it. Now we were able to be in the mix and talk with the bar tenders better (which is part of the experience in my opinion.) I noticed a large amount of Russian River taps and couldn't help but hide the excitement on my face. Without saying a word, the bartender had to let me down. That was all from Russian River night, none of those beers were available. Needless to say I was bummed. He showed me the bottle list which has a few impressive vintage bottles, but ringing in at about 50 bucks a pop I hesitated. I ordered something else and went on enjoying my time. Shortly, a small glass appeared in front of me and a smiling bartender. He (and who I am assuming the owner?) pulled a 750 ml Russian River Temptation batch 4 out of the cellar, opened it up, and split it between us. I was floored. To share such an expensive and rare beer solely to cheer up a sour fan was incredible to me. I thanked them and savored every sip. The beer was remarkable, by the way. \n\nBy the time our other friends joined us and a few more brews had been downed, the place was even fuller than I could have imagined. Every inch of space was full. My head was swimming and my belly was full. \n\nIf you have any interest in beer or craft beer, this is your mecca.

When I entered the bar, I couldn't help but notice that everyone looked the same-all white men in their thirties with a grungy motorcycle look (which i'll grant is a good look but it was very noticeable to my female friend and I that we were the only females in that crowd). \n\nThe bartender pretended that my friend and I (both female - and we were the only females there) did not exist despite that the bar was not too busy. We asked a man sitting at the bar to order drinks for us to see whether we were being ignored b/c we were women, and he was able to get the bartender's attention pretty much immediately, and without really trying. That was very disappointing to us, and especially to my friend who is very into beer and who had been looking forward to checking out the bar for a while.\n\nNext, the bouncer, who had already ID'd us at the door, specifically came into the bar to find me and ID'd me again. I am 28 (turning 29 next month) and do not look like I'm under 21. However, I am half Asian and I can't help but wonder, being the only Asian in the bar, whether I was targeted because of it. I left immediately after.\n\nI told my friend about the experience and he told me that he had gone to the same bar last summer with his friend who is Mexican. The bouncer told the Mexican friend that he didn't like him because he looked \"sketchy.\" They immediately left.\n\nBottom line: This place has a great beer selection, but a pervasive sexist and racist atmosphere. Just consider that before you step in and support it with your hard-earned money.", "author": "Mia M."}

The Toronado is not a dive, it is just a dump. It doesn't deserve to be classified as a dive; it doesn't have the character or historical legacy of a real dive bar. Granted, it does serve good beer, if they actually have it. There is an odor there I have never experienced in any other pub, hard to describe, something between a dirty diaper and halitosis. Dress accordingly, as you will carry this aroma with you after you leave. \nThe staff is hit or miss from hour to hour, day to day.The women bar keeps are generally funny and helpful, even with their apparent attitude. The men tap pullers are in a class of their own; they give the frequently encountered Haight-ful sullen, pretentious and mediocre customer service new meaning.  If it wasn't in the Haight, this place would only survive in Cleveland or Los Angeles.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-13", "description": "For context, I have been going to the Toronado since 1996 or 1997 and lived down the street for many years.  Instead of the typical review, I am going to break this down into two sections, A Very Short Review and Responses to Most of The Complaints in Other Reviews.  Let's begin.\n\nA Very Short Review:\n\nThis is the Toronado.  They were serving micro batch, high quality craft brews when 99% of the people that drink them now were preoccupied with memorizing the verbiage on the Budweiser label and were excited when Blue Moon came out.  Make no mistake, the Toronado is hands down the most famous/important (and in my view the best) craft beer bar in the world, if for nothing else simply for the relationship to the craft beer movement itself (it practically started there) and the owner's relationship with many very high level craft breweries.  There are beers that are brewed only for this bar itself - try going there on an anniversary and you will see stuff that is impossible to get anywhere else in the world.  Try going there on SF Beer Week and you will see a new keg of Pliny the Younger for 14 days in a row (yes it lasts 45 minutes sometimes but that is 14 times what just about every other Bay Area bar that serves Russian River beers gets).  I was there in 2012 for the Russian River brewery day - Vinny and his wife were both there and brought the stuff of dreams... (large format and everything).  This part was not as short as I anticipated.  But I digress...\n\n Responses to Most of The Complaints in Other Reviews:\n\n\"The Bar/The Patrons/The Bathrooms smell bad\" - oftentimes this is true.  There is nothing like the fresh hoppy scent of a Pliny the Elder that arrived the same morning, on tap to clear your nostrils.  Have two, trust me you won't smell anything offensive anymore.  And also, it's San Francisco, a lot of things smell in San Francisco.  Lighten up.\n\n\"It's cash only\" - this is also true.  Can you imagine what a mess it would be if they accepted credit cards?\n\n\"They don't serve food\" - this is also true.  There is a vast selection of sausages next door and you can eat them at the bar (or anything else).\n\nThe Staff is rude/surly/mean/doesn't understand my request for a \"light\" beer - dude, you went to the Toronado and ordered a \"light\" beer?  Seriously?  We've been making jokes about you for the last 15 years but until today I did not know that you actually existed.  You're actually lucky that the entire bar didn't kick the crap out of you on the way out.  The bartender was actually extremely polite to you given the situation.  That's like going to the most famous BBQ restaurant in the country and asking for the \"light\" ribs.  That's like going to the most famous restaurant in Italy and asking if they have Chef Boyardee spaghetti and meatballs.  Don't go to the Toronado and ask for a \"light\" beer, or generally act like a jackass.\n\nYes it is true that when the place is packed to the gills with people, the staff does not have much time for each patron to make a painstaking decision on what beer to get.  When it's not packed, the staff is pretty cool.  If you ask intelligent questions and genuinely are interested in the beers, you'll be treated with respect if not outright friendliness.  Oh, and try leaving a few bucks tip - it works wonders.  And when it gets so busy that you can't move in there, try to figure out what you want beforehand.  That's really all you have to do for great service at the Toronado.\n\n\"They don't have such a big/long/great/extensive beer list\" - yes, it is true that if you go to the Yard House, not only will it be cleaner and they may have more taps, but you're not going to find Cable Car at the Yard House.  Nor are you going to find Russian River's Toronado 2oth Anniversary Ale. It's about quality not quantity.  It's pretty easy to put 47 lager taps on your list, and I assure you that there's no difference in 98% of them.\n\nThat's all for now.", "author": "Michael A."}

And they have almost 1,000 reviews, so it's not like i'm going to be able to say anything that hasn't already been said. Basically, even writing this is pointless because I'm just contributing to maintaining their 4 star rating without adding any new or exiting information. Sorry guys.\n\nI've been here a few times now, at all different times of the day, and all different days of the week. I think I definitely enjoy the daytime drinking vibe in the middle of the week moreso than the Friday night vibe. Even if that means having to drink with a bunch of alcoholic fat guys who have nothing else to do with their time and money than to buy beer, at least they're spending it on good beer. The staff here is hit or miss. It's mostly a bunch of snobby rude beer freaks who get offended if you ask a question about any of the beers. Unfortunately for them, I take great pleasure in annoying the shit out of somebody. It's what makes me smile inside. If someone makes it blatantly obvious that they think I'm a complete idiot for asking what the difference in taste is between the Rodenbach Red Ale and the Iron Springs Epiphany Amber, then clearly I'm going to start asking even dumber questions purely to piss them off even more. That's just how I operate. \n\nBut once I'm done having my fun with the rude bartenders, I thoroughly enjoy my delicious beer and good company. Toronado would hands down be a 5 star in my book if it wasn't for all of the attitude that oozes out of the walls and taps here.

I think the bartenders are great and helpful if you ask about a specific beer.  Do NOT just say \"what do you think I should order?\".  They have a decent juke box and plenty of seating.  Sure, it smells a little like rotten beer (some of you think it's piss, don't you?), but it's a real brew bar.

We came over to Toronado with our food from the grill (it's a cooperative joint venture, feel free to order your sausage on a bun and sit at the larger, more spacious tables in the bar, but be polite and order a beer while you're at it!) \n\nCrowded and noisy, it's a typical beer bar with an extremely large assortment of beers on tap. Check the chalkboard up on the wall to find an option for everyone, even those that dislike beer (like me). Favourite brewery was represented (Russian River holla!), and they carry kriek and a pomegranate cider, both of which were mild on the beer taste and heavy on the fruit (my preferred drink!)  A waiter will come by and pick up not only your empty glasses but also your trays from the grill next door, so no worrying about running it all back.\n\nOnly one complaint, for which they lose a star: despite having several Russian River brews on tap, they were missing my favourite (Consecration!)  I saw \"Russian River\" written on the menu and got a happy little tingle in my pants in the hopes I could get my favourite beer, but sadly they weren't carrying it. I'm not sure if it just wasn't in stock or season at the time, or if they don't carry it ever, but I was quite disappointed (although I'll admit that it's self-inflicted disappointment, since I allowed myself to get all squee when I saw the brewery name).

It just so happened to be the same day as their Barley wine Festival so figured it'd be crowded, and yes, it was. There were so many varieties of barley wine (close to 100 maybe? I can't recall but the barley wine sheet was two sided). Even, the board that lists all of their beers was down to about 10 to accommodate the barley wines. \n\nAnyway, there were some hard core barley wine aficionados. After getting a sausage next door at Rosamunde's, we found a table in the adjacent room with empty chairs across from two aficionados. OK, so 3 hot and lovely ladies sitting across from these fellas, and did they bother to look up at us?!? UM NO! It was amazing how engrossed they were with their barley wine, sipping from their glasses, discussing how hoppy and malty each were, and ranking them on their sheet. \nHowever, the table behind us was a complete 180 from ours. Talk about young, rowdy straight out of college kids. They were so loud and annoying, and one girl's laugh was just so painful to hear. *And who wears white jeans in the middle of winter?!?

His anger and rage sits so close to the surface it's kind of pathetic.  \n\nBased on some of the other comments on here and what I heard from some people right next door that day, it looks like it was just another day in the life at Toronado.

Alas, every evening I've been in, the place has been chock full of carefully groomed wannabe bohemian types. You know the sort - look like a homeless person, but has a two bedroom in the Haight and works for Google bringing down $150k.\n\nClientele aside, they have a phenomenal beer selection. Excellent range of class beers you'd expect to find, as well as brews on tap from ultra-micro sources like Russian River. ('Twas here I first discovered Pliny!) and beers are served up at the correct temperature, in their correct glassware.\n\nAs I mentioned, the evenings I've been in there, the place has been extremely busy, and it took some time to get served. The bartenders  definitely had an air of snobbishness about them, and if you haven't made up your mind by the time they call on you, be prepared for a tongue lashing. Thankfully I had the foresight to look over their beer menu (note - it's not over the bar, but sort of at a 90 degree angle to it as you walk in the door, so it is easy to miss) but witnessed many a poor soul on the business end of it, when all they want to do was enjoy their night out.\n\nDon't buy into the hype too much.

There is a wealth of information there and will answer your questions. \n\nWith craft beer being more popular then ever these guys get bombarded with an assortment of novice questions or folks with a credit card (cash only) or in decisiveness, making it harder for us to get a beer. And they deal with a ton of tourists\n\nI've been coming here for awhile and see where the staff surface surliness may come from. Come in a few times and each time, know what you want, have your money ready, bring up your glass when you are done with your beer, and tip! Simple. You will almost always be rewarded with a free beer and the distinction as a \"regular\" than newbie. \n\nBeer selection is always excellent, prices extremely reasonable and even better during happy hour. Beer is served at correct temperature with appropriate glassware. Oh, did I mention they have several beers on hand pump. \n\nGo to Monks Kettle or any other beer bar and you will pay usually $2 to $3 more per beer, and have a environment not nearly as conducive as Toronado. Insiders tip. Go on a Tuesday afternoon and get a burger next door. Taste like a burger you'd grill on Fourth of July. Tasty and reasonably priced. Now lets get a beer.", "author": "Joe M."}

There is a side room which is also too loud, and a \"hidden\" room in front of that which is only opened during Belgian Beer days.\n\nSo here is my proposal, and I would chip in for this as I bet would a lot of other IPA lovers.

I have noticed one or two times when the bartender has snapped at someone else at the bar who was doing some minor but agreeably obnoxious thing (I think the guy was waving at the bar tender for a long time... just obnoxious enough for  the reaction to maybe be justified but just minor enough for it to maybe be unjustified). In general though it's far from being a visit to the Soup Nazi, and after 6 - 10 visits I never had any issues with the service. I would even say most of the bartenders are friendly... in their own unique way.\n\nThe only thing keeping this place from getting five stars from me is that it is dive-y enough inside for it to actually detract from the experience.

Apparently, this is the spot for all sorts of beers.....in fact, I felt bad about leaving a 1/3 of my Belgian $10 beer (good thing W and M were too happy to oblige in finishing it) but I'm not much of a beer drinker.

Huge selection from all over the place and all served in the correct silly special glasses. As it is a bit of a beer snob place and it's in SF it's understandable bartender might be a little snooty.  And there was an asshole bartender there, who refused to give more than one word answers describing the beers.  For someone who can afford to sample all the beers, cool, but for those of us on a little budget it's nice to know what we're getting.  It's one thing if it's busy but if they're sipping their beer right next to you you'd think they might be down to discuss it a bit?\n\nSo in summary amazing place but why do they employ at least sometimes jack ass bar tenders to work on slow nights who won't discuss the dozens of beers and is an ass to customers who don't know him besides.  So  unless I want a specialty beer i'd go somewhere else now cause normal beer is cheaper other spots around especially during happy hour. all in all great place for the occasional specialty beer", "author": "Matthew M."}

There is nothing better than picking out a delicious and unique beer and enjoying a sausage to go with it.  I am a big fan of specialty beer places in SF, and was pleasantly surprised when I tried Toronado this weekend for the first time.  This is a beer lovers paradise.  I was not disappointed with either the on-tap or bottled beer selection.  It was very thought out and luckily I was very thirsty... two nights in a row.  \n\nSome folks call this place a dive bar, but with the specialty and high end beers I don't feel as though it fits into that category.  If it were a dive bar then you'd have drank Miller High Life or Coors Light- not a Quadrupole from Belgium or a micro-brew from Timbuktu.\n\nI have to give this place 4 stars for one reason and one reason alone... they don't accept credit cards.  I hate carrying around cash or having to pull out a whole bunch to order some of Toronado's fancy beers.  What year is it anyway?  Maybe next time I will bring a checkbook to see if that is a valid form of payment.

Fantastic beer selection aside, there are some divey aspects to the place.  First, cash only.  Second, don't flag down the 'tender until you either know what you want or are prepared to provide him or her with useful information about what kind of beer you're interested in.  They're happy to help you decide if you give them something to go on, but as many have learned over the years, they will not stand there & wait for ten minutes while you hem & haw about it & ask for descriptions & tastes of half the menu.

The beer menu left nothing to complain about - more things on tap than I've seen pretty much ever, and it changes all the time.  And prices are quite reasonable, especially early in the afternoon when draught beers are discounted.  The place pretty much reeks like a dirty frat house, but I feel like that's part of the experience - it's a bar, after all.\n\nToronado lost a star from me, though, because the bartender was such an ass.  I understand you get the same questions all day long from a bunch of folks who don't know enough about beer to know all the things on your very extensive menu, and this is no doubt tiresome.  But at 3pm on a slow afternoon, don't bite someone's head off for asking a couple questions.", "author": "Amanda M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-04-29", "description": "This is my first-ever Yelp review. In fact, I created an account specifically to comment on all the passive-agressive whining I see here, not to mention all the victim-cards being played. I've been going to Toronado off and on since it opened in 1987, which is about 20 years before Yelp became popular. I have personally witnessed a few of the interactions which resulted in 1-star reviews here, and in each and every case, the reviewer would have you believe that they were not in any way at fault, let alone acting like jackasses or douchebags (or douchebagettes\u2122). In fact, I usually make it a point to look on Yelp to see the rather entertaining and predictable \"I was just quietly drinking my beer when the doorman beat me up\" stories the day after some incident.\n\nSomeone whining that they had an open PBR they brought in off the street snatched from their hand? LOL!!! The girl who whined that she got carded \"just for sitting at a table\"? LOL!! And the people who play the tired, well-worn race card saying \"it's mostly white people in there\" or implying that white people (whatever that means) somehow get better service? LOL!!! The fact of the matter is that I don't think I've seen a more ethnically diverse crowd in any bar in SF. Please put down the crack pipe...\n\nHere's an example of fantasy vs reality. A month ago I was sitting at the bar near the  front corner. Two young ladies were sitting off to the left a bit. One of them curiously goes to the middle of the bar to order and returns to her seat at the bar (turns out she left no tip). When they finish those beers, the second girl goes to the middle of the bar, also leaves no tip, and the bartender rather calmly and in a friendly tone said \"gratuities are accepted\". One girl starts making a scene about how the bartender was \"yelling at her and pounding his fist on the bar demanding a tip\", and he was basically laughing at her utter absurdity and pointing out that he was actually being quite polite and conversational - which is true, I was right there! Finally she played the \"poor college student\" card, at which point he said \"you could buy a 6-pack and drink at home if you're that poor\".  I actually laughingly told the girl closest to me: \"Be sure to 'Yelp' about how much this place sucks\"...Sure enough, another one-star review the next day (3/26/12). LOLOL!!\n\nWhy am I leaving one star? Because Toronado basically sucks! It's racist! \"Ghetto doorman\" (talk about racist, LOL) might beat you up! They'll rudely card you for \"just sitting there\"! They will rudely confiscate booze you sneak in! They will make you leave after last call even though you still have beer in your glass! Oh, the humanity!!!", "author": "David B."}

I was confused at some points I wasn't sure if I was the customer or if he was the customer. I ordered an item and the beer was all out, however the beer tap wasn't covered so to me it looked like it was available and all signs indicated that it was. Bartender looked at me like I asked him the dumbest question in the world before saying they were all out and moving onto the next customer. I then had to wait many minutes before I got serviced. Which was unfortunate because had he been a better bartender and covered the beer tap or scratched it off their list of beers like any semi decent bartender would have done, I would have ordered a beer that wasn't tapped out. It's stuff like this that rubs me the wrong way.\n\nAll in all I've experience much better dive bars and really aside from beer selection there's little reason I'd come here at least at peak times.

Actually, I don't think we have any\" and just sort of stared at me as I frantically searched the damn beer list again to see where I'd gone wrong. When I realized my mistake and corrected myself, the guy had this smirk on his face (AKA, he knew EXACTLY what I meant, especially since there was only ONE framboise/lambic on the menu) and continued to stand there.

I should have hated it, right?\n\nToronado is a dive.  Let me emphasize that.  Toronado is a dive.  There are some reviews that mention it, and others that call Toronado the 'best beer bar in America'.  Maybe the latter is true from a purely most-beer-for-your-buck standpoint, or even on the basis of its impressive menu of drafts that is guaranteed to challenge even the most dedicated of beer drinkers.  I happen to think that ambiance counts for something, so I wouldn't give Toronado such a heavy crown.  It is unquestionably, certifiably, in-every-way a dive.  PLEASE know that going in.\n\nNow that we've established that point, I will give Toronado its due.  The list of brews is amazing.  Totally impressive.  Phenomenal even.  They range from every corner of the planet and cover an array of tastes and styles.  Even me, someone who knows very little about beer and couldn't stomach an entire pint of Guinness if I was standing in front of St. James Gate, found some yummy drafts that I really enjoyed.  \n\nThe staff is friendly to boot.  They didn't laugh at me when I admitted my ignorance and inside helped me select a refreshing pomegranate cider that was different and enjoyable and drinkable.  And cheap!  Every pint on the list is $4 to $6.  Just make sure you bring dolla-dolla bills y'all, this place is cash only.  \n\nWhile I might not run back there as soon as I'm next in town, I would gladly recommend to others and would return with beer-loving friends for the adventure, quirkiness, and experience of it all.", "author": "CB M."}

He also makes helpful hand gestures if you don't catch on quickly enough.\n\n2) The graffiti in the bathroom is hilarious and witty. Much better than your average high school crap. For example, \"Fucktard is a shitbird.\" This is my new mantra. \nAlso worth mentioning, \"Fuck burning man. - your mom\"\n\n3) Urine has a peculiar consistency when it pools and sits on a concrete floor. As I was trying to figure out how to pee without soaking the hem of my pants, I actually slipped in a slick puddle of urine, and gently pulled a muscle trying not to eat shit. Keeps a girl on her toes.\n\nWe met two random people by asking them what beer they were drinking. Rather than describing it, they let us taste, then they joined us at our table and we all became bff through the magical friendship power of booze.

Definitely heard mixed reviews about this place, especially from our local friend, who tried to steer us away from the place, but he broke down and decided to join us.  Maybe he figured that we could see for ourselves.  \n\nWhile they do have a decent draft beer list and 50 taps, I was not blown away.  I was told later that they also have an extensive bottle list.  Either way, they had several local beers, sours (for the wife) and a good variety on the draft list that we did not even look at a bottle list.  Overall, the place was busy with most tables and the bar full, but we were lucky to get a table by the window on Haight street.  The tricky thing here seems to be the ordering process and /or interaction with the bartender. \n\nSo I take one for the team and approach the bar to order for all 3 of us.  The bartender kinds of looks at me funny, but gives a quick nod to indicate \"what do you want\" and I ordered.  A few seconds later, I pay the man plus tip and now I got 3 beers  and 2 hands so I have to make 2 trips.  When I go back to pick up the third beer, a guy at the bar starts talking to me like he knows me, but quickly he realizes that he has mistaken me for someone else.  So then I start to wonder why the bartender looked at me funny.  Do I look like a regular?  Am I dressed funny?  Do I have spinach stuck between my teeth?  I mean the bartender looked at me up and down before taking my order, so I am not sure what gives.  I guess that was just my experience at Toronado.

They have dozens on tap, all types and from everyplace from Belgium to Berkeley, including 3 or 4 cask ales at any given time.  If you can't manage to spot something you like on the long list of draught beers (look up as you come in), or on the list of specials and non-alcoholic choices on the chalkboard (look behind the bar near the front), ask to see the bottle list.  They've got quite a few interesting items.\n\nJust don't ask for one of those ubiquitous domestic lagers or attempt to pay with plastic. You will be frowned down.  (There's an ATM in the back.)\n\nIf you lack much experience with beers other than the aforesaid lagers, you can ask the bartender or any of the regulars.  Most will be happy to offer advice on the various beers and ales on offer.\n\nToronado doesn't serve food, but until 10 pm  you can get sausages from Rosamunde Sausage Grill next door (q.v.) and bring them in to eat with your beer.  Just tell the person at the grill \"it's for next door\" and come back for it in a few minutes.\n\nSeveral times a year there are special events, such as the Barleywine Festival.  If you're a beer snob, you won't want to miss these.\n\nCaveats:  Street parking in this neighborhood is hellaciously difficult.  The duration of vacancy of a legal parking space is measured in seconds.  Take a cab or the Muni or spend half an hour cruising for parking.  As the Toronado's reputation has grown, so have the crowds.  Since the bar opens at midday, the afternoons or Sunday evenings are best for a less crowded experience. You'll feel like a sardine on Friday or Saturday nights.  When it's crowded, it can take a while to be served.  Be patient and stand your ground.  Eventually someone will see you and wait on you.  The better you tip, the sooner you'll get your second round.  IDs are scrupulously checked here, either by the bartenders during the day or the person at the door after 9pm.

SHUT THE %$@# UP!\n\nSo I went to Toronado for the first time last week with a buddy after hearing about it from a beer geek friend of mine. We went mid-day on a Tuesday and the place was lively. I could not believe the selection of awesome beers and just about jumped out of my pants when he charged me $3 for a beer. When I get a beer by my place in South Beach I typically pay $6-$8 a beer, so this was huge for me!\n\nFor my second beer i wanted to try something different so I asked the bartender for a recommendation. At first he was kind of stand offish and told me \"they're all good, just pick something\". After I mentioned I wanted to try something and told him others I like, he steered me a bit which was appreciated.\n\nI DEFINITELY found my new beer geek home!!", "author": "Vernon L."}

As a girl, I often feel conspicuous when I visit a bar alone, but I had a great experience. I chatted with an adorable gay couple for quite a while, then I chatted a bit with the bartender (who was the owner/manager) about the San Diego location. I bought an \"SF Toronado\" tee-shirt for my boyfriend. The bartender was so helpful in advising the correct size and style. Sadly, they didn't have any girl's tees. I would have LOVED an \"SF Toronado\" tee to wear to our location. The bartender gave me a patch as a consolation prize which was nice. \n\nThe rest of the review is pretty much on par with my thoughts on San Diego's location. The beer is out of this world. They get an A+ for selection, quality, taste, and for not having any crap on tap. \n\nI never have problems with the service in San Diego and, as I indicated earlier, it was outstanding here as well. Even if it was horrible, I'd come here anyway. If I got punched in the face by the bartender every time I ordered, the pint would make up for it. \n\nI'm sure the food is outstanding here as well.

We arrived to a very loud and very full bar.  Two of us snagged the last table in the back room while the other two ordered beers.  The couple with us was not beer drinkers and one of them made the \"mistake\" of ordering a red bull and vodka to be rudely responded to with \"Do you see an #I^*&^^& liquor bottles, man\" as the bartender walked away.  Not a great start.   We finished our one beer and got out of there, sad and disillusioned.  \n\nThe nest afternoon, my husband and I had been at Danny Coyle's watching a Premier League game and decided to give Toronado one more try.  Upon entering, 2  well on their way guys made some sexual innuendos to me.  No biggie, I can take care of myself.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-16", "description": "For my 100th review, I knew that I needed to do something important - the review that I would have the most trouble with telling the whole story while keeping it relevant and honest. With this in mind, I decided that I would have to do the Toronado.\r\n\r\nI have a long history with the bar. For the final years of the last millenium, my wife and I chronicled our evenings there on our online journal (yes, this was pre-blogging), and there was lots to blog about. We talked about the bartenders, the regulars and the invaders from the Marina who looked utterly confused when the folks behind the bar said \"No, you can't have a gin and tonic\" followed quickly by \"No, you can't have an Amstel Light\" and finally by \"No, you can't pay by credit card\". The Lower Haight was going through a fight for its very soul - battling against SUVs, gentrification, yuppie encroachment and the chain stores and shops that wanted to replace local establishments... and the Toronado was the point where the battle would be won or lost.\r\n\r\nThat was the late 1990s, and now in 2006, things haven't changed that much. During the days and weekday nights, it's full of regular Lower Haight denizens - and on Friday and Saturday nights, it's a battle between locals and folks from different neighborhoods (and tax brackets). Pauly, Johnny and Kirsten are still behind the bar, and Tad is still the best bouncer in the city - I mean, how many people can come up with a trivia question like \"Name the three characters from MASH that were there since the first episode\" on the fly? (The one that everyone misses is Nurse Kelley... she's the key to the whole series! - I think I won a beer for getting that).\r\n\r\nSo many of my life changing events - from birthdays to our going away party when we moved to Connecticut in 1999 were held at the Toronado, and while I lived just 2 blocks away in a tiny studio apartment with my wife and two cats, the Toronado was like my living room - where I went to relax and to entertain. During the big power outage when the state was plunged into darkness, the Toronado served the neighborhood beverages while Rosamunde turned on their big gas grill and served up sausages for the locals. Up until 1999, the Toronado was home.\r\n\r\nThe bar hasn't changed at all since then. The banner from the bar's first serving of Aventinus on tap is still there, and aside from the growing rack of empty 3 liter Duvel bottles on the wall, the bar is exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that even though the Toronado hasn't changed in the past decade, I have.\r\n\r\nI still love the beer - 46 well selected taps (though I wish they would rotate some of the taps more often - I love De Koninck, but there are other beers that should occasionally take that slot) and a bottle list that is beyond compare in this city and possibly in the country. I've gone there with judges from the Great American Beer Festival and been able to stump them with flavors they couldn't attribute to a specific beer style, let alone a brewery. I love the fact that Dave leased the space to an ex-Bartender to start Rosamunde. The festivals (Barleywine, Strong Beer, Belgian Beer, Oktoberfest, Fresh Hop and many more) are always amazing - the barleywine festival becoming one of the seminal barleywine events worldwide.\r\n\r\nBut as I get older, the music starts to quickly get too loud - and even though I used to be there two or three times a week in the late 90s, now that I am no longer a regular, sometimes I feel like a stranger. Certain new bartenders throw more attitude than necessary, giving non-regulars the stinkeye before reluctantly taking an order - which is a shame for a beer bar that beer lovers make pilgrimages to from all over the world. I'm not saying that you need to be nice, but you need to be respectful of your customers up until they make assholes of themselves.\r\n\r\nYeah, I don't wear t-shirts and ripped jeans any more and I live in a SOMA loft, but the Lower Haight is still in my heart, as is the Toronado.\r\n\r\nStill, I would love for them to install a drain in the bathroom so I don't have to wade through the piss on the floor when I have to take a leak.", "author": "Avery G."}

It's been a rough week, and sometimes a girl needs a fiendishly good I.P.A in a place where everyone leaves her to her own devices\n\nI've been searching high and low for a gnome and was seriously envious of their little pointy hated friend shooting me a mocking smile from high above the bar. The wall is littered with photos, some aged and from what appears to be like decades ago.  \"Behind blue Eyes\" played, and my severely mopey countenance and increasingly inebriated ass identified with the selection, in a way that made me think these were my people. \n\nMy musings were briskly interrupted by the questioning yell of \"Steve?!? Nick?!?\" The half door by the entryway makes the ideal platform for Rosamunde, the hot dog joint next door, to try and pinpoint its wandering customers. The \"no dogs allowed\" sign is entertaining in an ironic way, given that there were two furry critters taking turns at emitting piercing howls. \n\nBeers on draught are proudly marqueed high to the left of the bar. In addition to their list of draughts, they have an extensive bottled beer selection. Unfortunately, the available selection differs slightly from what is advertised on the website, so you may have to hope the beer you've had your eye on is still there. But overall, their selection is pretty goddamned decent, and almost all of their seats were taken when I popped in at 1:30pm on a weekday. Apparently everyone else had the same great idea of extending their lunch hour to down a few pints, although my guess is no one there really works standard nine to five hours in business casual. \n\nI got extremely excited, I mean sexually, by how many hot scruffy dudes populated the place - and were genuinely nice. I had serious thoughts of blowing off the rest of my workday and my income, but I figured that wouldn't be the wisest or most appreciated use of my time. Another charming touch was the dude sitting on a barstool, burping his ABCs as his dog yelped in accompaniment.", "author": "Kristen H."}

Sure, there are plenty of beer snobs who frequent this place. (I may in fact be one of them, depending on who you talk to.)

Sure, it can get busy and crowded at times but that's par for the course. During the Octoberfest celebration last week it was nuts--but the bartender still was courteous enough to answer questions about the beer on tap & provide tastings of a more curious brew (Moonlight's Artimis Gruit, for those wondering--made with wormwood in place of hops!).

One thing I'll agree with other reviewers is the fact that the staff can be quite surly, but can also be quite helpful if you follow normal bar rules, like not waving your money in the air or shouting for the bartender.

They do have a decent selection but the bartender was awful. I believe her name was Robin and every time I ordered a beer she seemed confused and looked up at the menu on the wall for assistance. When i ordered bottled beer to go she doubled back and said \"ok let's do this one at a time\" and had to take the bottle menu with her to retrieve each beer one at a time. She clearly had no knowledge of the beer she was selling. In addition to that she was rude and impatient. I can deal with that, it isn't an upscale bar and doesn't try to be, but a craft Belgium beer bar should employ people who know beer and train them on the beer they sell. I didn't even bother to ask her about the beers i was unfamiliar with and just looked them up on my phone. i must be spoiled by Philly because Toronado's \"extensive\" bottle list included less than 100 beers and any good Belgian beer bar specializing in sours and barrel aged beers will have well over 500 in Philly.

One night my friend and I stopped here (she's a cider fan and they have a pomegranate one she had never had) and sat at the bar chatting with them about how drunk the girl falling off the stool next to us was. Eventually they told me all sorts of things about beer I didn't know and let me taste all their favorites and stare at all their kegs. THEN, the best part, they gave us both 2 FREE shots of these weird drinks (kind of like fernet - which i love). I need to go back and get the name. Apparently it's made of herbs and not considered hard alcohol (they don't have a hard liquor license) and calms your stomach. It was gross and new and fun and free. \n\nAnd yes, if you didn't catch that up there... THEY DON'T SERVE HARD ALCOHOL. So don't complain when you get there cause beer is AWESOME.

(been doing that since the 80's) BTW, in case ur wondering, I've been to Belgium several times in search of beer, so, I'm not ignorant, but, in Belgium, they encourage questions and interest in their \"faire\". I wish I could say the same about this place. Attitude, attitude. Get over yourself. You're a bartender, you schmuck. At least have the pride to not be a snotty a**-hole when I ask questions about the bar's (not YOURS), excellent biere menu.\n\nUpdate: over the past year I've been back half a dozen times and haven't run into any rude bartenders. The good beer choice has never been an issue. Its a great beer bar. I hope things continue this way. So, in the name of honesty...Bumping it up to 4 stars.", "author": "Rich M."}

On the one hand, it's a great place for hanging out with my friends and I've spent several nights kicking back and having great conversation (by the way, the smaller room in the back is better for conversation because you're shielded from the crappy and uneven sound system). I like that you can bring in food from nearby and that they are (usually) dog friendly. I also enjoy a bit of attitude in my bartenders.\n\nBut... it's all beer and I'm just not a beer drinker. Nope, I'm a good old-fashioned queer boy who believes that alcohol should come in mixed drinks with trendy or funny names. And while their selection of beer with trendy or funny names is admirable, I inevitably gravitate to the cider option because it's the only thing that isn't beer.\n\nTrue story, on one visit I was lucky enough to be the first patron to order after the bartender had just bitched out some other guy who wanted a mixed drink of some kind. Seeking to balance the wheel of karma, or just because we were polite, the bartender decided to buy us our drinks.\n\nOn another occasion, I arrived just after there had been a fistfight involving another beligerent customer and a bartender. The bartender in question showed back up at the bar about an hour later with a nasty cut on his mouth that had been treated at the ER.\n\nSo at least it's rarely boring.", "author": "Jere K."}

It is, after all, one of the original purveyors of the ultimate celebration of the hop, Pliny the Elder.  But I digress...this review is about Toronado!\n\nPros:\n1.) Beer!  Toronado served Russian River, Drakes, Bear Republic, Sierra Nevada etc. long before these Bay Area breweries improved their distribution.  Toronado is a testament to the vitality of craft brewing in the Bay Area.\n2.) The barleywine festival rocks your socks off.  Just get there super early.\n3.) The bartenders are very friendly, as long as you know your elbow from your asshole and you don't act like a dipshit.  This is not a lounge, it's a bar.  Be respectful to the bartenders, tip, and you get your beer.\n4.) No food.  This is actually a good thing.  I don't want to belabor the point, but Toronado is a bar; if you are looking for a brewpub, go to the breweries themselves.\n\nCons:\n1.) Toronado attracts hipsters.  If you love beer as much as I do, you have to bite the bullet and just ignore the Che Guevara t-shirts and nut-hugger jeans.  Years ago, this type of clientele would be persone non grate at Toronado.  To quote the immortal Bob Dylan, \"The times, they are a-changin'\".\n2.) Seating can be fairly awful, because of the reason above.\n3.) The glassware needs some updating.  I'm not really a hardass on this issue, as long as the glassware is clean (which it is), but the snifters are pretty beat up and need replacing.\n\nIf you love beer, have an ounce of patience, and can put up with the hipsters, Toronado is a must.", "author": "Daniel F."}

OK, that's not very nice, but decorum plays 3rd fiddle at Toronado.  There recently was a Yelp thread about dumpy bathrooms in public places in SF, and I just about nominated at least two of the bathrooms here.  People just seem to like to drink beers and write stuff on the walls in the can at Toronado.  I wonder, do people say to themselves while they are getting ready: \"Cool pants and shirt, check.  Cool shoes, check.  Wallet, cell phone and keys, check.  Permanent marker, check.

But no other place with as much discussion about the bartenders.  So we went to drink beer with our cell phone videos primed for shooting something that would go viral on youtube.  \n\nThe dream scenario, a fat red faced tourist from Alabama versus a gay leather clad bartender from the Haight.  Red State vs Blue State,  It never quite happened, but we got close.  Over my left shoulder comes in a one percenter in a suit from France (not like the French have an attitude or anything.)  He orders 4 glasses of beer, 18 bucks and leaves no tip.  Unfortunately the bartender kept his cool and blew it off.  \"I took one look at him, knew he would not tip, and moved on.\"\n\nDang, no drama at all.  \n\nThe first guy behind the bard might have been more likely to provide fuel for a review.  Just as the shift was changing at 4pm a glass dropped between them and the first guy, going off shift, muttered some stuff about how lame it was to be serving beer in wine glass and no wonder they broke when you dropped them.  \n\nOur guy had the bar alone with 50 people in the place.  He was faster than any bartender I've even seen.  At one point he took 4 ones, a guy's change, and flicked them about 5 feet.  The 4 ones hit the glass and dropped perfectly.  \n\nWhile we were there it was happy hour.  Every thing is a dollar off.  Most beers are 5 dollars, so during happy hour you order a beer, give the guy a 5 which includes a deserved dollar tip, and they don't push the button on the trap door below your barstool.\n\nI imagine you could go into this place and get abused, but in my experience you will have deserved it.  \n\nDid I mention they have about 40 different beers so if you can find a few beers here you like it is your problem.  And, if you ask in a normal way for a small taste of something it's no problem.\n\nIt's a BART and MUNI ride from where I live so I won't be frequenting this place, but I would definitely go back.", "author": "Rudyard K."}

Torn between my quest for amazing beers and the not so amazing atmosphere, service and lack of seating I loathe, I always return. Yes, the beer always wins.\n\nProbably the best place for geeky beers on the west coast outside of O'Brien's in San Diego.  Their tap and bottle selection is vast and extensive.  Bottled beer is available to go.  They don't server food but I can't think of any other way to eat than next door at Rosamunde's sausages (but that's another review entirely).  Talk about a symbiotic relationship, beer and sausages. mmmmmmm.\n\nSome highlights from the beer list include: La Folie (one of the only places in California where this is on tap when available), \"The Duchess\" (on draft yay!), Any IPA such as the world famous Pliny The Elder and other IPAs (especially on hand pump) such as Green Flash Green Bud, or Moonlight's \"Bombay by boat\".  Their bottle list contains my favorite labels such as Cantillon, Russian River, Fantome, Lost Abbey, and a few others.\n\nToronado etiquette aka tips for success:\n\n1) be prepared to stand\n2) be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for service (order two beers to make it worth your while)\n3) know what you want to order when they get to you.  any sign of waffling and you're last in line again\n4) do not ask for wine\n5) do not, and i repeat do not ask for Bud, Coors, Corona or any other macro beer -- you will be asked to leave\n\nBonus tip for the adventurous: \n\nHere's a San Francisco original for you to try. Ask for the \"Damn Foggy\" - Half San Francisco's original Anchor Brewing's Old Foghorn blended with Half Russian River's Damnation.  You're hearing it here first directly from the creator. If it's not \"damn foggy\" up in sf at least you can have it in your glass!", "author": "Matthew S."}

Three clean bathrooms too - yeah, they know what pints of beer do to folks and they are well prepared!\n\nA great pub with a great selection of draft beer and some in bottles (to go!).  We really enjoyed checking out all the beer handles that are part of the decor.  Plenty seatings - take your pick at the bar, the pub tables across the bar or the lounge like area in the back.  A good mix of patrons from young to old and light to dark.  \n\nWe got here about 12:30pm after getting our grubs (a dog from next door and some BBQ from across the street).  The bar was mostly taken but we needed a table to spread out our food so we took a table across.  $7 for 2 pints - that's crazy but we are not complaining!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-30", "description": "The toronado is an SF institution...the first on my list of must see beer bars in the city...really, in the country.  \n\nThe selection here is sublime.  With forty-something taps, there's nothing lacking in terms of selection.  From mysteriously unpronounceable belgians to the freshest Norcal brews - all bases are covered.  It's the only place in the city where Russian River brews can be found with consistency (though Monk's Kettle is working towards it).  \n\n They've got cask conditioned 'real ale' on tap (one of two locations in SF - the other being Black Horse), and prices hovering between $3.75 (the majority) and $7.50 (for the more rare/foreign treats).  For the most part, beers are served in their proper glassware, and the more boozey beers are served in smaller servings to keep your slur to the later slice of the evening.\n\nThe Barleywine Fest (in Feb) is the best way to find warmth in the fog, and the Wet Hop Fest (during the fall harvest) showcases \"wet hopped\" beers redolent and rearing with volcanic hopttitude which have been brewed with hops no more than 24 hours off the vine.  The 'nado is also quick to showcase a particular brewery's best on a random weeknight with little or no advance notice.  Their website is updated rarely and inconsistently, which makes it challenging to find out when creative pourings are going down (better to check Beer Advocate or the Brookston Beer Bulletin).\n\nYou can bring food in from elsewhere (Rosamunde's sausages a favorite).  Finding table space is a challenge on weekends, once you've got it, you're in for a solid session.\n\nThe only real drawback is the in your face attitude, which eminates from behind the bar and is cold, abrasive and poorly played.  I've seen a couple thrown out of here on a busy night because they couldn't pull their ID's out quick enough.    \n\nAll in all, it's a dive with high shelf taste in beer.  The ambiance and attitude are trumped by the cheap quality on tap and it's remains a favorite and in the top three for a proper pint in the city.", "author": "bryant g."}

Only a few steps in, the enormous beer menu looms above, beckoning you to try any of the excellent varieties.  A glance to the right and hopefully your eyes admire the variety of glasses, none of which are for show but used and properly matched to the style of beer you order.

The selection is unique with Death and Taxes, Lagunitas Sirius and Anchor Old Foghorn all on tap, not to mention a great variety of German beers and favorites from the Northwest region.  If you're bored with the beer selection at your favorite bar, give this place a visit and you may come back more than a few times.\n\nI don't know why the bartenders are aloof.  We could speculate on it eternally.  Yes, they can be reiminiscent of Seinfeld's illustrious Soup Nazi (No Lager for You!!!) if you ask the wrong or too many questions.

If you have a question, try to mention a comparison to another brand so they think you know what you're talking about and always have a back-up in mind.\n\nYeah the space kind of sucks and if you want to sit down get here early but I think the crowds are just a testament about how great it is to be able to go somewhere and actually have a huge array of beers not easily found elsewhere in the City all in one location.\n\nMy roommate will give me unrelenting hell for giving this place such a high rating given his disdain for the bartnders but gee...  just look at all those beers...", "author": "Steven R."}

We check it out (during which point my two male friends apparently have to stare down some guy who's staring me down - being in bars with boys is AWESOME) and not only is there ample seating in the booths in the little back room, but there is a decent-sized TV mounted on the wall.  I hold the booth, my two lovely gentleman grab the beers, and then we settle in and watch more shots of Lincecum looking stoked(dorky/hot.)\n\nBeyond these felicitous circumstances, the bar itself is one of *those* beer places that has a \"really amazing\" selection of international beers.

This was on a weekday about 6pm so it was not busy by any means. The bartender (middle aged male with long curly hair) seemed to be deliberately ignoring us. And even when he did service us, it was in the rudest condescending way. My date (who has been a bartender for 7 years, and now manages a bar/grill chain) couldn't believe the way we were being treated.

The bartender was busy socializing most of the time, but when he did finally happen to walk to my end of the bar, and was asked very politely if we could get napkins.... He let out a notable sigh and gave us a serious look of disgust when handing them to me. Like previously mentioned my date has been a bar tender for quite a long time and we would never leave a mess or disrespect a bartender. The wait for the beers was absolutely ridiculous and took us nearly 20 minutes to get served (and the bar was NOT crowded... ...this was not a Friday night there) When I asked if we could switch our beers because they were warm, we were told \"No that's how they are supposed to be, you ordered it man\" as he rolled his eyes and walked away.

No one will be impressed, particularly the bartenders.\n2) If you're hungry, stop at the excellent Rosamunde Sausage Grill next door and place your order. Beer loves sausages. You will be told to return in 5-10 minutes to pick it up. You are welcome to bring your sausage in a yellow basket into the bar as long as you clean up after yourself.\n3) There really is a caste system at the Toronado; it's the \"regulars\" and everybody else. If you belong to the latter category, do not expect any conversation or pleasantries or any other sort of human interaction with the bartenders. Don't take it personally, they treat everybody this way.\n4) Know what you want. There's a beer board at the back of the bar. Study it and be ready to place your order when the bartender acknowledges you. No questions, no conversation. Grab your beer, tip $1 and find a place to drink it. As you drink your first one, strategize about your second. A session beer, under 5.5% abv (I like Allagash White as my \"thinking beer\"), is a good start; you can always go higher with your next beers.\n5) Get to know your neighbors. Unlike the bartenders, most of your fellow beer drinkers are quite friendly and more than willing to share information and beer knowledge. This can help you make your next beer decision.\n6) Finally, try to pick a day and time when it's not likely to be too busy. Mid-afternoons are perfect, even on weekends.

If you have a Card, I wouldn't even try to use it, as it's seems like they might do something that isn't kewl with it. The good part about the bar is that the drinks are $4 for beers. The baretenders are far from clean, and totally smell like left over bong juice spit.  They are kinda rude as hell. The old man bartender can be such a perv to women. The women there are equally rude as the man. The size of the restroom is small, and smells even worst. Seeing that, it is a bar, and in the Haights. I let that pass. It's somewhat crowded, and most of the drinkers are young. Still, there are better bars than this. \n\nSupposely it's the best beer in San Francisco, I kinda doubt that, but it's not the worst.

Toronado is the easily the best beer bar in the city, with over 30 beers on tap, and a whole page front and back of bottled belgian beers.  Try not to be intimidated by the WALL of beer that is the menu, though you almost certainly will be (I was).\n\nyes yes, people complain about the bartenders being beer snobs.  \nThey are, but they know their stuff.  Don't panic.  here's what you do:\n\n1) When flagging down the bartendere, know what you like, if not the exact beer you want.  Though the bartenders are beer-snobs, they're still friendly.  If you don't know what you want to drink, tell them what type of beer you like, and they'll give tastes of a few beers before you buy.  They are serious about their beer, and like it when you are too.\n\n2) Don't ask for a PBR, Bud, or any of that shite.  \n\n3)  If you have no idea what you like and want to earn the bartender's immediate approval, order an Old Stock barleywine (from the tap if they have it, otherwise just get the bottle).  \n\n[I had a beer here from the bottle called JW Lee's I believe, that was brewed in LAGAVULIN (read:  very smokey/peaty single malt scotch) casks, and it tasted like honey ham...delicious... I kid you not.  Don't miss the barleywine festival.  If you didn't know, Barleywine has like 15% alcohol, and is basically really really strong beer, that is usually really really tasty.]\n\n4) Go buy a gourmet sausage from Rosamunde grill, next door, and enjoy it with your beer at the Toronado.  Rosamunde rents their space from the Tornado, and the grillmaster at Rosamunde will even come bus tables in the Toronado every once in a while (though you really should bring the baskets back for the guy).

They have collected beers and ales from around the globe and while it can get a little pricey (up to 12 dollars a pint if memory serves) they are offering a great opportunity to tour through Europe from the comfort of your bar stool.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the bartender (Johnny) was really friendly and chatty and at one point after he'd forgotten to bring me my drink he just put it on the house.

One is tugged in either direction by both the awesome and terrible aspects, so it's a matter of what is most important to you and how much you can put up with for the good things.\n\nI'll get the bad parts out of the way first so I don't have to end on a sour note.\n\nThe bathrooms rival many gas station bathrooms in repugnance.  Seriously, they are the single worst thing about this joint.  We're talking *puddles* of urine on the floor, literally.  To be a woman and have to use the loo here would be about 10 times worse.  I'm a guy, and am not usually easy to offend with stuff like this, but man, the bathrooms are awful, especially the later into the night it gets.\n\nThe other big negative is of course the staff.  They have a reputation for being surly, and it's well-earned.  About the best you can hope for is silent indifference.  These are not happy, cheery folks...think NYC, not Austin.  In fact, if you feign inferiority, know exactly what you want, have the cash ready to go, and don't ask questions, you will get much better service the next time.  They seem to know they have one of the best beer selections in the country, and perhaps the arrogance derives from that.  It sucks, but whaddya gonna do?\n\nWhich brings us to the good stuff.  It's what you came here for: the beer.  They've got the goods, no doubt.  It's easily one of the best in the country for beer nerds.  Certainly not THE best, but among the top 10 probably, top 20 definitely.  Serious artisanal stuff from Belgium, a ton of west coast micros and even some random German and British stuff on tap, and all in good condition (no damned frosted mugs here!).  They don't mess around with much pedestrian junk, though of course it's not ALL good.  But the owner knows his stuff...it holds up to scrutiny from the most active beer hounds in the country (beer people come here from all over the world, in fact).\n\nAnother very cool aspect is that although they don't offer any food, you can BYOF from anywhere you want.  Lots of folks go next door to the sausage place, which is indeed quite tasty, but there's burritos and Indian food nearby too.  Heck, bring your own sandwich from home if you want.  This is a killer policy IMHO, because you can enjoy the beer you want AND the food you want, instead of being limited to the food they might have offered.  Falling Rock in Denver really needs to consider this option.\n\nWhile you have to deal with the dodgy staff in order to get a glass in front of you, play it cool and you'll probably do fine...ever since I figured out how to behave here, I've never had any problem.

It's a beer-lovers dream come true.\n\nTheir offerings are many and well-chosen. It's remarkable that you can get so many great beers in one bar. And the bartenders will guide you well - I can't tell you how many fantastic beers I've had there simply due to the bartenders caring enough to make sure I know what sorts of special kegs have come in recently. I read some of the other yelp reviews - and maybe some of the bartenders can be a bit surly at first, but if you act like a civilized person, tip well and are interested in what you're drinking, you will be rewarded with some of the best beer guides around.  \n\nAnd what's the most perfect neighbor a bar like the Toronado could have?

I've generally had pretty good experiences with the tenders here.\n\nKudos for their Oktoberfest night (with free Rosamunde sausages and oom-pah band), the annual Barleywine Festival (preceded as always by a huge greasy breakfast at Kate's), the great jukebox, and all the specialty beer nights they host.

This is soooooooo overrated.\n\nI'm giving 2 stars for the well-rounded beer lineup, but the service here is probably the ABSOLUTE WORST I've ever experienced in my entire life. I'm really wavering between 1 and 2 stars, but they do have a good beer lineup including some that you'd be hard-pressed to find anyplace else, although they did not have some key styles I wanted. No Biere de Garde in bottles or on tap. No Flanders Red in bottles or on tap, not even Duchess de Bourgogne. The board listing the draught options was nearly half empty. Maybe this was due to it being Saturday during SF Beer Week, I dont know, but I expected more from the famous Toronado.\n\nOther than the beer offerings, there is no other redeeming quality about this establishment. A bathroom that doesn't require a Hazmat suit to enter would be nice, or how about being able to actually converse with the person sitting next to you without getting a sore throat from yelling over the obnoxious juke box. I wont even get into the gads of smokers (yuck, smoking is NOT cool) polluting the air since they are allowed to smoke right in front of the half door to the bar. Even if these things weren't an issue, the service is so severely awful, it ruins everything.\n\nI know my beers. I know them well, yet the bartender - after completely ignoring me for a good 20 minutes despite many instances of eye contact - acted like he'd rather drink a pint of vomit then spend 1 minute taking my order. He went back and offered to help the guys adjacent to me twice before I finally had to wave at him to say that I was next. Was this gender discrimination? Maybe girls cannot possibly know enough about beer to get served before all the guys had been taken care of? Then when I did get his attention he acted like it was MY fault that he did not have anything to offer in the styles I requested. Jesus Christ, it's not like I ordered a Bud Light and wanted it split into 2 glasses and garnished with a lime wedge. I settled on 2 beers from the board, and he got my order WRONG, bringing me two of the same beers. The guy sitting next to me offered to buy the duplicate beer since that's what he wanted. Do you think the bartender made any effort to bring me the other beer I ordered? Oh HEEEEEELLLLLL NO! He was done with me, ripping the 20 dollar bill out my hand and then slamming my change down at the bar and storming away for good. Worst service I've ever experienced. There is no reason to ever treat your patrons this way, EVER.\n\nSide note: I just happened to be here with 2 of my friends from a very highly-acclaimed, award-winning microbrewery, who were in town for some SF Beer Week events, one of which is the brewery owner (although we did not make this known - shouldn't have to). Our experience was certainly not good PR for Toronado. I think we all agreed that we'd probably not go back there, at least not the one in San Francisco. The San Diego Toronado is much better, at least the bartenders give a shit. I will still proudly wear my San Diego Toronado shirt. Even if I had wanted to buy a SF Toronado shirt, I couldn't, because the bartender was too busy working on earning his BIGGEST ASSHOLE BARTENDER title to sell me any merch.\n\nNext time I'm in SF and want a good beer lineup, I'll go to City Beer Store on Folsom where they have an excellent selection and the people are cool and nice.", "author": "Seana D."}

Delicious.\n\nStill, it's a good selection of beer for a night out - around 40 beers is nothing to complain about. I always have a lot of fun there, too. Snag a table if you can and keep it all night. It gets loud and crowded, and if you're drunk it's even better. A pretty good place. And the sausages next door are an even cooler thing.

Having limited my alcoholic beverages to wine and sweet cocktails--my beer tasting at the Toronado broadened my deprived palate to now include beer (and my growing knowledge of it).  A good friend invited me to the annual Toronado Barley wine festival - bringing me back full circle--to how closely beer has been appreciated, elevated with toasts, names and  what memorable moments they carry.\n\nIt has been a couple of years since my Dad's first deployment to the Middle East, but the memory of family and friends gathered together drinking San Miguel beer (a pale pilsen lager so well suited for the buffet style of \"pulutan\" filipino soul food) eclipsed the worries and angst that generally accompanied such sending-off parties.  Food was also a way to unite because sharing a meal was giving another sense to remember the time together.  Yes I remember them all--fried lumpias, dry adobo wings, sisig, empandas, grilled Bangus (milkfish) relleno, deep fried pork knuckles with a spicy vinaigrette sauce,  and of course pancit!!! As a farewell gesture- a toast to my Dad's safe return included my the first time tasting beer--yup JUST ONE sip of it!    A bitter sweet moment- bitter because of how it tasted and sweet because I still remember my Dad's glistening eyes and approving smile.  It would be another year until we would all see my Dad again and celebrate his much anticipated return, with lechon that time around!\n\nSo on an invitation from a seasoned  Barley wine festival goer, I found myself at the Toronado- where people of all types- young and old, students and teachers, workers and the financially secure, women and men enjoying their glass of brew laden with mystical wishes that only plain water and honey could make .   The beer was no longer bitter, it seemed to have 'grown' with a delicious and distinct taste.  Like wine, its complex bouquet left trails of orchard fruits plump succulent plums, pears and even melons from the flights of beer as they made their way to the eager tasters.  Glasses filled with colors of vibrant warm sunshine to glowing ember of sunset, each crowned with foams that peak off the brim or just slight like a layer of melting snow,  nestled on the frosted glass.  I saw them all at the Toronado- a deserving destination for anyone with a beer story to tell.\n\nThe highlight of my visit- was tasting  about 12 different varieties (and I was just having sips--from each one of course)!  One that stood out in taste was Sisyphus The boondock from Texas.  I was struck by the name  adding to the mystery of how zymurgists intertwine labor of love with the fruit of their harvest.   Perhaps these ideas mirror life's sisyphusean cycle , just like one early evening at the Toronado ...\n\nPS.  Now that I have access to a home brewing accoutrements- I shall name my first brew- Verre de l'Eau Vivant.  And that's not the Biere talking ;-) hmmm or maybe wait and taste it first!\n\nPSPS.  Rosamunde is just next door with sausage pulutan sandwiches :-)", "author": "Arissa C."}

HOWEVER, when I went next door to order, I was told they were out.  (Oh, but it seems if you are young and hip, they are NOT out of hamburgers after all, since they were still serving them to tattooed hipsters).  I ordered duck and wild boar sausages.  Meh.

But if I were, I think this place would be great- it's like the cheeseboard of beers, so many choices it could be stressful. Located in the lower Haight, this hard core dive bar is filled with hipsters, hippies, and hipster-hippies (and no doubt some people who transcend any classification whatsoever ) completely at one with their myriad brewed creations. Oh it's dirty. And it's loud too. Oh and there's barely anywhere to sit and the bathrooms are filled with interesting yet entertaining graffiti. But that is indeed part of the charm. You come here to drink beer, and that is what you get. Not much else to distract your beer drinking bliss. I think there is one cider on the menu, which I tried and it was pretty good. So if you come here knowing all this, you won't be let down. Toronado does a good job at serving beer. Period.\nQuick update: I was at Toronado last night and brought in a bag of cherries. The guy checking IDs at the door told me that if he saw cherry pits on the floor that he was going to hunt me down later that night and make me memorize the phone book. Scary threat- make sure not to leave cherry pits on the floor!", "author": "Kate A."}

I sometimes think they're not surly ENOUGH, though, because all the clueless fucking Chads and Kimmies keep showing up, asking for their Bud Lights and Appletinis anyway. \nThe first time I ever set foot in the place, when I was visiting from Seattle, the bartender rolled his eyes at me when I asked him what style a particular unfamiliar local microbrew was, and then condescendingly explained what an IPA was, I got a little annoyed, but that happens lots of places because the concept that there are women who actually KNOW and LOVE beer is still a new one to alot of guys and they assume you are clueless. \nI don't even try to go there during any of the fests except the Wet Hops one, because I hate being squeezed in with a million people. \nOn the flipside, when I had my birthday there, the bartenders (Paul?) came over and sweetly asked for a slice of cake too, and wished me a happy birthday and it was all peachy. And when a dozen beer-geek friends and I held a beer & cheese tasting there once,  taking up pretty much all of the back room, they were nice as pie to us all and came over to grub some cheese with us. \nI'm not a regular there (because it's not close enough to home), but I find that if you don't act like a choad and actually know what you want to drink and don't ask dumb questions, they treat you well and hook you up.\nSo I guess that the T is sort of like an old friend who is really smart and fun but a raging PMS-y bitch at times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-11", "description": "This is definitely one of the best beer bars in the country, but due to the spectacular selection, it's also often packed, loud, and you will often get some grief from the bartenders.  For the uninitiated or baffled, here's some free advice for maximizing your enjoyment of Toronado.  Note: I have learned most of these the hard way.  I know this is long, but I don't want you to make the rookie mistakes I made.\n\n* If you mispronounce the name of a beer, no matter how obscure, expect that the bartender will correct you.  Don't be offended, but make a mental note for next time, or, better yet, offer a simple apology and reorder with the proper pronunciation this time around.\n\n* If one or more of the beers you order turns out to be at the opposite end of the bar DO NOT under any circumstances leave your original location.  You may think this is a helpful way to reduce the trek of the bartender or your own wait, but it will only serve to annoy the bartender and may lead to you being chewed out, which will, in the end, delay your drink.  Again, I learned this the hard way.  However, the same bartender who bitched at me for this on one occasion gave me a free drink for some minor mistake I can no longer even remember on another.  The moral: despite what you may read here, most of the bartenders are actually really, really cool, but you can't be too sensitive.\n\n* If you see someone (often, in my experience, the guy with dreads) washing glasses, restocking glasses, gathering empty baskets to take next door to Rosamunde, doing any number of other tasks, shooting the shit with his friends/customers, watching TV., or doing anything else behind the bar other than asking you what he can get for you, DO NOT attempt to order a drink from him.  He is the elusive and fascinating creature know to imbibologists as the barback.  He is not a bartender or server, and he is certainly not going to get you a fucking drink.  I know you and your friends have been waiting a long goddamn time.  I know what he's doing may not seem as important to you as the procurement of drinks for you and your friends, and you may, in some cases, be right.  But, that is, as they say, the way it is.  The actual bartenders of the establishment may be in the bathroom, changing out kegs, at their granddad's funeral, or nowhere in the hemisphere.  You can't order beer from the barback.  Sorry.  However, the barback is a really cool guy, and if you're lucky, you CAN talk sports, beer, local history, or any other pertinent topic with the barback.\n\n* Sometimes it seems impossibly crowded by the bar, but there are still places to sit in the back.\n\n* As at a lot of places, the best times to drink here are during unconventional drinking hours (before 5).  Here, it's doubly true, because everything is $1 off, which means great beers are $3 a pint!  This includes Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n* My favorite bartenders are the Irish guy and the lady with long, dark hair.\n\n* Cash only!  If, like me, you don't like paying ATM fees, go to Walgreen's just on the other side of Fillmore and choose \"debit\" with \"cash back? yes\" so you can spend that $2-3 on something you actually need.

In 2001 I started drinking \"real beer\" and while in the city for a Sigur Ros show my fleece clad hippie friend suggested that we go to the Toronado before the show so that's exactly what we did.   I had heard a lot about this place, and I had seen the ads in the Beer Celebrator magazine, so I was picturing something big and elaborate.  I was way off.  This place is a hole in the wall dive bar and I love it.\n   This place is a dirty grimy watering hole with tons of great craft brews on tap along with a stellar bottle selection.  This place is no nonsense, it is all about the beer (like me).  They do not serve food but they will gladly let you bring in outside food, and the San Francisco Tamale lady cruises through there in the evening.  \n   I have read reviews saying that the service was less than benevolent but I have never had any problems.  Maybe its because I grew up going to the city almost every weekend as a kid and just got used to that pompus San Francisco attitude so it doesn't bug me.  I have actually been there during a slow day when a guy went in and ordered a Bud Light.  I thought the bartender was going to throw some beer snob attitude at him, and instead he was cool and offered the customer something light.\n    Anyhow I have now been to a bunch of great beer bars all over the country but for whatever reason the Toronado just feels like home to me.  I have a dream of one day buying a booth at the Toronado and retiring there.  \n   Even though she's dirty, dusty, and grimy, the Toronado is my first love when it comes to beer bars, and if you know me that is up there with my love of your girlfriend.", "author": "That Guy G."}

I think they are fan-freaking-tastic, especially when Stuart calls people \"bloody fucking idiots\" to their faces when they can't remember which beer was which that he set down in front of them and specifically said which was which a mere 7 seconds earlier.  That's not rude, it's character :)  Plus, the idiot should have been paying attention. The people that write bad reviews about them are probably the same people that stand at the bar shouting \"Excuse me!\" \"Hey! Can I get a drink?!\"  and then roll their eyes when it takes more than 4 seconds for them to have a beer in hand.  Jesus H.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-24", "description": "If you like beer....I mean good beer (not Bud, Miller, Coors, Heinekin, Becks, Corona, etc) the Toronado is like one of the 12 wonders of the world.  I discovered this place about 3 years ago and have been about 100 times since.  Recently I have become a Dad, so it makes it a bit tougher to get up there (I live in San Mateo).  As for the beer...about 50 or so taps at all times with all very good American craft beer, or specialty beers from all over the world (mostly Belgium).  They do not serve any traditional macro (mass produced beers).  The most macro you will find there is Sierra Nevada and Anchor Steam (both perfectly good beers).  They also have a menu of about 100 different bottles as well.  All the beers are served in the appropriate style glassware and they do NOT chill their pint glasses!  Happy hour is a dollar off most beers every day from 11:30am until I think around 4pm.  They have special beer events there from time to time with guest brewers giving lectures and serving their beers as well as special weeks and or months dedicated to a certain style of beer (April, I believe is Belgian Beer month, while the Barleywine Fest is held in February).  \n\nAs for the service and the food.  There is no food served at the bar itself.  However, they will let you bring in outside food.  They have a wonderful sausage place next door called Rosamunde.  They even make some of the best burgers in town on Tuesday's only.  There is a pizza place on the other side which is OK and a tremendous BBQ place accross the street called Memphis Minnie's.\n\nThe main style of the bar is a typical dive bar.  I wouldn't say it's dirty, but it isn't quite clean.  I've never seen any rats or anything, or food laying around on the floor, but it does have a dirty vibe to it.  It's quite dark inside with 3 graffiti laden bathrooms (which are quite fun to read while you do your business).  They have about 6 tables with stools in the main room plus a bar with about seatng for 15-20.  Plus they have a small even darker attahed room with another 4 large booths with tables.  The bar is decorated with classic brewarania material (lots of metal signs and lots of magnum empty bottles, plus a huge assortment of tap handles above the bar.  There is a jukebox by the restrooms with a very ecclectic assortment of music...mostly metal and heavy stuff.  They place gets loud...very loud, unless you are there in the early opening hours of the day.  The best time to come if you want to get a table and have some sort of peace and relaxation would be between 11:30am and about 3pm any day during the week.\n\nThe service is...well....all depends on your attitude.  If you come in acting like a smart ass, drunk or a very stuck up think you know everything type of person, you are likely to get the tradtional Toronado treatment (which is sometimes rude, brash or worser).  If you are a normal every day person..especially with a good sense of humor, you will really understand this place.  It all depends who the bartender is.  There are some that are really nice and a few that are pieces of work. The best story I have is of a yuppie couple that came in and sat at a table.  The woman speaks up and asks if the bartender can come and bus her table (they last lazy customer apparently didn't dump his food basket).  Well, the bartender tosses a wet rag, hits her in the face with it and tells her to go knock yourself out.  So, the service can be a bit iffy at times to say the least.  The staff, however, is quite knowledgable about beer and will probably lead you in the right direction if you have a question about beer.  The one important thing to remember is that it is cash only...I believe they have an ATM in the bar, if not there are several ones on the block. Parking is also quite tricky.  If you come early you have a better chance of getting a spot close by, if not right in front of the bar.  If you come later or on weekends, you will find yourself walking a few block from your parking space.  To sum things up....if you really enjoy good beer, you will leave here quite satisfied.  \n\nA few regualrs on tap\n\nRussian River Pliny the Elder\nRussian River Blind Pig\nMoonlight Reality Czech\nMoonlight Death and Taxes\nMoonlight Twist of Fate\nAnchor Steam\nAnchor Liberty\nSierra Nevada Pale Ale\nDuvel\nAventinus\nRadeberger\nHoegaarden\nplus several others\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Chris S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-29", "description": "Hands down, the best bar for beer in San Francisco.  A vast selection of imported and micro brews populate the great number of taps at the Toronado.  Also, their list of bottled beers is impressive too, plus you can get those to go.  The Toronado does a great job of hosting a great many events throughout the year, The Belgian Beer Fest and other soirees which include the world-renowned barley wine festival or a brewery's latest concoctions and so forth.  Grab a sausage next door at Rosemunde and pair it up with a delicious brew at The Toronado.  The only downside, some beers will go quickly, and not make their next appearance until the brewery sends more.  If you're content with drinking, Miller, Heineken or Corona, this is not the bar for you.  Well-crafted Belgian brews, hearty IPAs and those hard-to-find suds are what you'll discover at The Toronado.", "author": "DamnGringo X."}

Its uncomplicated, so why does the local crazy have to act up or the bus driver yell at those who don't put their dollars in correctly?  The same can be said of the Toronado.  They offer something wonderful...a wide medley of beers that, like public transit in this beautiful city, can take me to new places I've never been.  However, nowhere is there that service with a smile (well, if you get the mean lady bartender).  If you are new to their system, you suffer and look the fool.  If you happen to get the nice guy...it can make your trip through the vast landscape of beers a pleasure, a journey to remember.  Good job but don't get too cocky ^_^", "author": "Scott N."}

The staffs at this joint will physically man-handle their patrons for absolutely no reason at all. My friends and I were enjoying our time and beers on a regular weeknight. The thing was we were not drunk, nor rowdy, nor disturbing anyone else. But were approached by the staff telling us to get the F*** out, just because we finished our drinks 5 minutes ago. We tried to reason with them and ask why we are being asked to leave, that's when things escalated. They started yelling at us and making a big scene. One of the staff even threw a coaster at my friend, as he was yelling at us to tell us to leave, then he proceeded to grab my friend and pushed him to the wall. Needless to say, they were acting more like THUGS than bartenders and bouncers. From what I have read in other reviews, seems like their rudeness is well documented. I hope the owner of this place gets some new and better staffs, because these guys are the worst of the worst. You can't expect to run a long term profitable business if you rely solely on your beers and allow your customers be treated this awfully.", "author": "Brandon Z."}

A coworker suggested Hayes Valley, and my first pass through, I thought, \"Wow, this looks like a cool neighborhood, but they need a BAR, a good BEER BAR.\"  I had all but dismissed the neighborhood, and then I found Toronado just a few blocks away.  I was intimidated at first, even as a somewhat seasoned beer taster with a palate for a diverse range of beers.  With a selection like this, it's hard to know where to begin.  In the end, Tad made some great suggestions, and I had an awesome time.  The biggest downside to the place is that getting a seat at the bar can be extremely difficult, but I can fault them for being popular.

Intense only because once you enter you are bound to get drunk. This place only serves beer and wine however the beer they have here is no joke. They have about one million (not really but emphasizing) beers on tap. I made my way up to the bar and decided to order two beers at once since it seemed  there was a long wait. I order two Magnolia's Proving Ground IPA and the bartender looked and me and asked if I have had this before, I said yes and he handed me my beers with a look of \"I warned you\" on his face. I chugged the first beer in 5 minutes and began on my second.\n      Meanwhile my friends all began drinking and after trying multiple beers they found what is called the Denogonizer (sp?) which is about 12% alcohol content. Next thing I know everyone is feeling more chatty, people leave so we move in on a table there was about 10 of us in our party.

No liquor and no shitty beer helps keep the crowd here pretty down to earth- you won't have to suffer as many fools as you might elsewhere. Like many other bars in SF, Toronado is cash only, so there's an ATM in the back. The beer list is easy to read so you can take your time deciding what to order without having to crowd the bar squinting at handles. I love the bartenders. They're very no-nonsense, but not surly, and give this place so much personality. They will not hesitate to send you elsewhere if you try to order Budweiser (which indicates that you are an idiot for failing to see that it's not on their 12'x4' menu) or fail to observe very basic bar etiquette (regardless of where you are, don't snap at your bartender to get their attention).

One wasn't a beer drinker and some other customer ordered what sounded like a merlot.  So I was trying to ask the bartender if they actually did have wine.\n\nMy conversation went something like this:\n\nMe: \"Hey can I ask you a quick question?\"\n\nBartender: (Mumbles something unintelligible)\n\nMe: \"Sorry, what was that?\"\n\nBartender: \"I said I'm fuckin' busy, you prick!\"\n\nMe: \"What the -- excuse me, there's no need for that.  Don't talk to me that way.\"\n\nBartender: \"I'll talk to you any way I want you fuckin' prick, or I'll come over there and fucking kick your ass.  I told you I was fuckin' busy.\"\n\nMe: \"I said don't talk to me that way.  I just had a simple question.\"\n\nThe bartender pulls my full glass of beer out of my hand, throws $4 at me (I paid $15 for the round of drinks, including tip) and tells me to leave.  I said I would leave when I got the rest of the money for the round back.\n\nBartender: \"I will come over there and beat your ass if you don't get out of here right now.\"\n\nApparently this bartender is known for his issues, and the owner doesn't fire him?  A sarcastic bartender can add some ambiance to a dive bar.  But I'd prefer to have my beer without threats from complete douchebags whose only validation is in being worshiped by people ordering beer.\n\nDon't bother with this place.

Also, if you wanted a superbly decorated bar, then you would pay at least double or triple their current prices.  \n\nTo the people who complain about the \"decor\", for one, I actually like the cozy casual neighborhood pub like feeling.

As someone who considers himself to a certain degree a connoisseur of beer, or less obnoxiously put someone who is always in search of a good cold one, I was intrigued by Toronado and its offerings.  I was not disappointed by the selection, but the overall experience left something to be desired.\n\nLocated on Lower Haight, a favorite locality of yours truly, Toronado is situated in what I feel is an ideal setting, with Ali Baba, Rosamunde's grill, and a plethora of other reasonably priced and tasty food options. Toronado has a wide range of fine Belgian and local brews, ranging from the more widely available Chimay, to the uber-sublime and floral Edel Weiss, which must be imbibed by any first timer.  \n\nThat said, a bar is more than just an establishment that dispenses booze, especially considering the range and variety of bars in the city.  Toronado may have one of a kind beers not found in any other bar, but does that overcome mitigating factors that tips it in the opposite direction?  I know it's already been said, the bartenders can be beyond curt to the point of brusque and curmudgeonly, and I've personally witnessed customers being snubbed for a number of reasons, some warranted, some not so much.  The demographic of the patrons also merits discussion, as the Haight attracts an eclectic mix of people, but can also be to the detriment of the environment of an establishment like a bar, and Toronado is a classic example.  While a crew of vigilante hog riders does add a certain element of anti-establishment social edge, a bar full of them creates a non-inviting and borderline hostile atmosphere.  That, and the entire space, not just the bathrooms, smells like an unplesant concoction of urine and pine sol.  Not good drinking times.  \n\nSo three stars from me, earned exclusively for the truly unique beers , and zero for the destination.  That said, what do you value?  Substance?  Style?  Both?  The choice is yours, choose and drink wisely.", "author": "Michael P."}

Went to get sausages first which were excellent and they let you take them into the bar to eat. A great partnership between the dank beer bar and the dank sausage shop directly next door. Was throughly amazed by their selection of beers upon entering. Looked over the menu for a while and noted the following brewery selections; Dogfish Head, Russian River, Drakes, Sprecher, Petrus, Chimay, Moonlight, Anchor, Anderson Valley, Speakeasy and more. I also noticed someone cracking what looked to be like a Belgium Longneck bottle of something heady. After a few pints, I saw that they also had a beer menu besides the one hanging on the wall. I may have missed out on some rarities, but I was not dissapointed with the selections we chose. Between the four of us, we each had 2 pints and shared sips of each others. Pliny The Elder, Midas Touch, Damnation, Death and Taxes were noted as being really fresh and tasty. The glassware selection and pairing was superb. The bar is not too large and from what I've heard really starts to fill up at night. Luckily we were there early afternoon, but I did notice it starting to fill up rather quickly. The lighting is somewhat dark and the decor was a history book of heady beers. They keep all their previous taps and I must say there are a lot of them. These were in addition to the 30-45 taps they currently were serving. My only complaint was the bartender could have been more polite and attentive. She didn't acknowledge me at the bar when I went up twice and served a couple others before me that came up after me. It would not have hurt them to have a 2nd bartender working either. Next time I'll be bringing my notepad to take notes on their selections and tastings.\n\nIf you visit San Francisco, this is a must stop when vising Haight Street.

As soon as I joined my roommate at the bar I was served instantly. But the experience it self was uncool. This is 2010 for gods sake. Well It sucks for me cuz I love good beer. :(", "author": "Shana K."}

Plus, they don't care if you bring your own food, and Rosamunde, next door, has some sort of deal going on with them that allows you to carry your basket o' sausagey goodness over and the folks at Toronado will return it for you.\n\nSome folks might argue at the necessity of using the appropriate glassware for a particular beer, but I am always impressed that the bartenders will go out of their way to find either the glass printed with the name of the beer you are drinking or one that will properly showcase its flavors.\n\nService: I have yet to acquire a taste for at least one of the daytime bartenders, but I admit, as long as I can order more than one beer at a time so I never go thirsty, I could care less if he ignores me most of the time.  I don't go to bars to chat up the barkeep; I go to indulge in tasty libations.  At night, you'll always be treated well by Stuart, Alene, or Tad, unless you are a jackass, in which case, they'll be happy to have you escorted (read: thrown) to the the curb.  I like knowing that I can enjoy a beer without some jackass messing up the experience.\n\nThe beer selection on tap is definitely tipped towards the hoppy end of the spectrum, with some Belgians, Stouts, etc. mixed in.  If you like the malty side, check out their bottle list, with plenty of vintage selections, although the prices at City Beer are better.  As far as draft, reasonably priced beer goes, there aren't many better in my book.\n\nBest of all, they are open 'til 2 A.M. every night of the week.  I love this place, and frequent it often.  Having recently moved to the bay area from Memphis and starving for great brews, I'm pleased to say it's across the bay from me, or I'd be there every day.\n\nFight for a seat at the bar or a table: it's worth it.

No, I'm sorry, no acknowledgment that he nearly knocked me over. Funnily enough, he was walking away from cleaning up a spill. Here's a tip, if you open your eyes, look where you're going, and don't run into people you won't have so many spills to clean up.

This is the only bar in the city that I've been to where I just can't even get the time of day, let alone a beer.  I'm polite, money in hand, waiting my turn, making eye contact and not calling out, but the (male) bartenders would rather chat with their friends or clean glasses or just disappear rather than serve me.  And it's not just once or twice that I've been burned, it's like 8 or more years of not getting served at this bar before I finally gave up.   I tip well when I do get a beer, but it's just not worth the effort.  I note that the awful service I've gotten has been from the male bartenders.  Via whatever coincidence, I think the persons who actually have served me the most often were female.  I think I even had to wait once for her to come on shift before I could get a beer.  But I don't go enough to remember if it was the same woman, or if all of the male bartenders were as guilty as the next.\n\nMaybe I'd go at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, but never after 7pm.

Many places in the city have a good selection of beer on tap, so that fact alone shouldn't consistently rank Toronado among the dive bar legends.  \n\nNow, let me preface this review by saying that Yelp reviews that lambaste a place for one specified bad experience, or poor service where you obviously shouldn't be expecting better, drive me nuts.  They are mostly irrelevant and vindictive.  However, occasional and unapologetic hypocrite that I am, I am going to do exactly the same thing.  \n\nI don't expect much from a bartender at a place like Toronados aside from bringing me the correct beer in a timely manner.  Which the bartender did.  He then proceeded to give me change for a $10 bill instead of the $20 I had given him.  It was the only cash I had in my wallet (having just withdrawn it from the ATM) and it was my second drink of the evening, so there was no way I was mistaken.  After harshly asking me several times in a row if I was positive he had made a mistake (are you SURE, I mean POSITIVE, I mean ABSOLUTELY SURE) he went to correct his mistake.  And by correct his mistake I mean he got the money out of the cash register, but before returning it yelled about how he doesn't \"fucking make mistakes\" and threatened to remember me if I ever came in his bar again.  Well, buddy, apparently you did make a mistake, and a relatively big one-$10 is a slow evenings worth of beer-however, you did, at least, succeed in ensuring I that I won't be back again.  Being short-changed is one thing-I know it happens-but being yelled at and threatened in front of the entire bar, seconds after walking in, for being short-changed is another.\n\nLike other inflammatory, purposefully hurtful reviews that so annoy me, I won't go into clientele, atmosphere, or anything else that people might be interested in knowing-all that is probably covered in at least one of the other 300+ reviews, anyway.", "author": "V.

We talked a little but about enjoying the atmosphere, and he slid a comment in to make me able to translate my surroundings to you: \"And there's a sausage place next door!\" he exclaimed.  Although Toronado IS a sausage fest in it's own right, there is a joint next door that sells italian sausage sandwiches.  I just looked at him and said, \"That is such a guy thing.  NO girl I know likes a bar because... \"AWESOME!

In LA and during my stint in the OC, we had the Yardhouse, which probably has more beers to offer than Toronado, an extensive food menu, and much more seating. But- Toronado has my heart, and I will continue to have a slight contempt for the chain, mass marketed concept behind the Yardhouse, though I will continue to frequent them for their massive beer selection. Toronado is dark, dingy on the inside, has limited seating and a pretty dirty, ghetto bathroom. Happy hour is also from noon to 6 pm everyday and they have an awesome selection of brews from all over- from obscure microbrews to delicious belgian ales and wheat beers. This place gets packed on Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays and it tends to get hard to find seating. Also- they have a bring your own food policy, and with Toronado's proximity to Rosamunde Sausage Grill, as well as a yummy middle eastern and ethiopian place, you have the best of both worlds. Delectable  food and delicious beers. I have heard complaints about the gruff service, but I have never had an issue. I usually ask the bartender for his reccomendation and I seem to get better tasting beer, and better service that way.I have spent hours upon hours on end in this place, drinking beer after beer and getting more and more wasted.

I grew up on good beer that was cheap and available. Living in California the past 2 years has been a major shock. There is no good beer here that is cheap and available.\n\nThe Toronado was therefore refreshing, but not as refreshing as I'd like. California has the residual beer mentality that good = import, and therefore the more Belgians we sell in wine stores, bars, or upmarket restaurants, the more beer cred we get.\n\nI experienced this disappointment with the Toronado list. Over half the spread was Belgian or Belgian style. For christ's sake, diversify.\n\nThe pro's: Moonlight and Russian River are both on the list. Happy hour is affordable and long-standing. Rosamunde's is next door.\n\nThe cons: Belgians are overrepresented. Little thought is given to stylistic diversity (there were no stouts and only one porter on the board when I stopped in). There is little thought given to regional diversity - not enough Californian brews on the board, and I only counted one Northwest brew (tragically, Full Sail Rip Curl - not exactly the best rep for the birthplace of the renaissance). No East Coast brews. What the fuck is going on? Divey/punkish atmosphere: take it or leave it. I grew up on traditional pub styles, but if you want your bars harder, whatever. Service: taciturn. Goth boy was behind the bar, I talked beer with him for a while when he wasn't busy. He didn't recognize my Alameda Brewing shirt (shame) and hadn't heard about the Lagunitas bust. On my second pint he nagged me for a tip in a snotty, condescending way. I tip at the end of my stay, not with every round. He lost the %20 I had tucked in the back of the wallet for him.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-03-05", "description": "Quite simply one of the best beer selections on the west coast, and the  Barley Wine festival is one of the best beer events in the country.  The bartenders, for the most part, are rude bastards tho.", "author": "Bryan J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-21", "description": "Obviously they have one of the most fantastic beer selections in the city.  They have tons on tap and even more in bottles including some amazing belgians that are a little pricey but a good thing to blow some tip money on.  The place is alright bartenders are total a-holes but I think they try to be.  You can take in outside food and all that good stuff.  All around a great beer bar especially if you can find a seat.", "author": "Daniel S."}

Avoid the lady with the dark hair and the vintage clothing and the worn looking face and the smart ass bitchy attitude thats' a Bettie Page wanna be and you may be okay. As for me i'll never go back there because of her. Any business that allows someone like that to work for them I make sure to stay clear of. Toronado gets no stars from me.", "author": "Bernice D."}

And the beer is oh so right. The selection is down right overwhelming... until you spend a couple of evenings working your way through all the wonderful selections. I've never had service that was downright offensive, but I have felt neglected at times. All that said, drink up.", "author": "Matt B."}
