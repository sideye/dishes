I got some sort of fruity green tea drink and had to toss half of it out to add water and it was still too sweet. Second time I got the lychee snow and that was pure sugar water. If you can't make a drink less sweet, please tell me so I won't order it. I had to toss this entire cup away because it was undrinkable. They're not cheap either.. 2 drinks were $10.

That's what happened to me today and I was ready for a mid-day snack. This place opened up not too long ago so thought I would give it a try as it reminded of the egg waffle when I traveled to Hong Kong. \n\nI ordered the Yoshi Bean eggette which is a mixture of matcha and red bean and also ordered the matcha milk tea (no boba, also comes in a plastic bottle). Eggette was pretty big and filling and I almost was able to finish the whole one by myself. Outside is pretty bland. Occasionally you will get a ting of matcha or red bean depending on where you chew. Matcha milk tea was good. \n\nOverall, not bad for a try for a snack. Others have complained about the wait time and price. Wait time for me from order to pick up was about 10 mins so not too bad as they make it right in front of you behind the glass. Price came to about $10 for both items.", "author": "Annie L."}

The bottle with a screw cap does not contain much when compared to the regular sized milk tea cups at competitor boba, milk tea type places.  Additionally, you'll have to bend your straw to fit in the bottle if you want to recap your drink.  I like to keep my straw straight and not bent if you know what I mean. \n\nI had the Hot Summer which was watermelon juice with cheese foam and added lychee Jelly.  Refreshing but not enough to quench a thirst.  Sig other had the Four Seasons Cheese Float made with tea and cheese foam with boba.  The boba was spongier than the boba that she was used to.  I liked the boba and she didn't.  The boba was definitely different.  Follow-Up:  the Boba is Agar (Algae) based and not rice based...\n\nShared a Yoshi Bean eggette which was matcha and red bean.  Not bad but could have been crispier.\n\nOverall, okay, but a little pricey on the drinks considering the size of the drinks.  Note - you can also watch them make the eggettes behind a glass partition.  Nice to watch if you've never seen, however, if you've made a waffle at a hotel using the pour and flip waffle maker, then you won't be impressed.", "author": "Scott L."}

I couldn't decide on one so I ordered TWO... Oreo star + double yammie = $10.01 including tax. What's great is the price of the waffle and egg puffs are the same. You pick a flavor and then the form. Unfortunately, Eggxotic missed the mark for me. \n\nOreo star -- star cereal gets placed in the egg puff maker followed by some Oreo batter and a generous serving of Oreo crumbs and coconut flakes. Sounds good right? The cereal tasted stale and you couldn't taste the Oreo flavor, which boggles my mind considering there were Oreo crumbs and Oreo batter. Also, the batter is straight black! How'd they get it straight black, like a sharpie? Although it least it was kind of crunchy and crispy where the puffs connected, the texture was off. \n\nDouble yammie -- purple yam batter with loads of mashed purple yams. As I was watching them add the purple yams, I thought to myself, \"Yes, this is great! There's so much.\" But when I ate it, I was not pleased. Let me say, I enjoy purple yams. However, I'm expecting a purple yay egg puff, not straight purple yams, which is basically what I got... ok, maybe balls of purple yams with a thin layer of batter over it. It was mushy, not crispy or crunchy at all like egg puffs should be. The consistency was just all wrong. \n\n(Review not based on the following, but I wanted to share.) The last thing I will say is... my egg puffs were given to someone else! I was standing right there, and I saw my ticket with my ticket # attached to the corresponding egg puff maker. Another employee walks over and gives it to the couple next to me and mine has to be redone, which means more waiting for me. I mean, you'll probably think I'm just being butthurt. Maybe the couple's order was forgotten about and the employee was exercising good managerial skills or something. It really wasn't THAT big of a deal to wait another 5 minutes. But all I could think about in that moment was what could have been will never be! ... I'm really just being dramatic now. \n\nThe employees were nice, like most other employees at any other egg puff or boba shop. Will I be back? Maybe for the drinks, but definitely not for the egg puffs. You'll find me at Eggettes for that.", "author": "Angie Y."}

Like they have to separate the lines because it's too long and the store next to it probably gets mad, but oh well. Just be aware of that and don't go cutting in between, k. \n\nThe menu isn't super extensive. If anything, I was mostly just impressed with their menu for eggettes because they offered both savory and sweet options with combos that I've never even heard of. Kimchi in an eggette? That's totally wild. Their drink menu is not extensive and since you're not able to create your own drinks as well, you're pretty much left with majority of fruity options and then their regular house milk tea or a matcha milk tea, I believe. \n\nPrices are what they are. I've seen worse for boba so this wasn't too bad, plus they just automatically give you your drink in a bottle which seemed pretty cool since other places would normally charge you extra for that. \n\nI opted for the S01 which was the galaxy drink, can't really remember it too much but that's one of the drinks they put the flashing light underneath to make it look cool for the 'gram. Tbh, too sweet and not impressed. Eggettes were also going to be a 20-30 minute wait around 2pm on a Saturday so my boyfriend convinced me not to wait. Heard a little girl asked the eggette maker what number he was on to which he replied \"74\" and the poor girl was number 89. \n\nOverall, I DID want to try the eggettes, HOWEVER, I am totally content on not trying it as well because the wait was too insane for ordering and waiting to get the eggette .I'm good.", "author": "Venus L."}

It was pretty good considering I've never come across this flavor combo in an eggette before. It had a strong matcha flavor with bits of red bean scattered throughout the waffle. It could use more red bean to balance out the bitterness of the matcha imo. \n\nThe exotic drink was alright..pretty average. It was only cool bc the bottle lights up and the colors are nice to look at but I would prolly pass next time. \n\nI think the only thing they got going for them is the variation in flavors for the eggettes lol \n\nWorth a try for the one time but that's about it for me.", "author": "Coco L."}

I had the Nutella and banana and oh.my.gosh! They make right in front of you so you can see them pour the batter into the \"waffle iron\", add the ingredients and flip the darn thing which of course makes your heart skip a beat because you know you are that much closer to egg puff heaven!\n\nThe line is kind of long so my order of 4 drinks at Quickly had the eggpuff line beat...and that we only ordered 1. They have a decent array of choices for both sweet and savory egg puffs but we had already had dinner and just needed dessert. They also had some milk teas that came in a nifty light up container that made you feel as if you either had a galaxy contained within the bottle or you were about to drink a rave. Cute but a trap I didn't fall into (pats myself on the back). I think it was a 10+ minute wait but it was worth it. \n\nAs you can see from my pictures, the thing was bigger than my face. I think we paid $3.95 and it was worth it if you ask me. It was hot and there were bits of chocolate and banana in each puff.

I have had countless yummy egg puffs over the years you might say.   And I could tell that the place is putting in efforts in making the legit egg puffs by having the small fan and rack to cool down the egg puff once they were done from the bubble waffle maker.  That is the legit way in HK making egg puffs that are soft and chewy on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. \n\nI am glad that I stopped by today cause these yummy egg puffs here did lift me up from my bad Friday!\n\nI will be back trying their other flavors.", "author": "Toasty H."}

Like everyone else that gave this place a poor rating, they're not wrong. I was craving eggettes and super surprised that they opened one in Stonestown. \n\nHowever, their menu aesthetic took more effort than needed to understand how and what to order. It was basically a mess of jumbled words. I honestly wanted plain eggettes but wasn't offered on the menu like the actual OG Eggettes in San Mateo County. Instead, I ordered the matcha flavored eggettes with red beans. They take awhile to get you your order since there's only 4 machines. In terms of flavor and worth, definitely NOT worth my $6. The eggettes essentially tasted more like a thick and dense waffle than your usual crispy exterior with hollow and semi chewy inside. The matcha flavor had a burnt aftertaste, so not pleasing at all. The workers also seemed not friendly and wanted to get the hell out of there. \n\nOverall, please don't come here for eggettes. It is not worth your time and money. You might as well drive a couple more miles south to get the real deal for $4 at Eggettes or even next door Quickly's is probably better...", "author": "Lisa L."}

There were about 8 people in front of me.  Finally my turn after 20 minutes,  I ordered two eggettes - oreo and purple yam.  The girl was so nice to tell me that probably would take 30 minutes for eggettes.  I asked what was the current number and she said #34 and mine was #42. Since I was free, sure why not?  \n\nI walked around the mall and came back after 25 minutes...the girl told me they just called #37... wow seriously? I waited another 30 minutes for my eggettes (only, no drinks). I guess they only had 4 machines there and took almost 15 minutes to make one.  Nothing much they could do to speed it up.   \n\nRegarding to the taste, I don't taste much different from the two eggettes.  The oreo one had coconut inside which was odd and there was not much oreo flavors.   The purple yam had real yam inside which was good but not too strong flavors either.  The only good thing was not too sweet.\n\nThe line was way too long for eggettes even on a not too busy day.... definitely won't go back.", "author": "Liza T."}

At a glance, you can see the employees making egg puffs. They have at least 4 egg puff irons. Let me tell you, the stations looked like a hurricane ran through it. I almost wished they didn't make the front of the house so transparent. I guess it was more of an organized mess to put it lightly. At least it wasn't dirty!\n\n[Service]\nWe came around 3-4pm on a Friday. The line wasn't long at all, however, there were a lot of people waiting around for their order. Definitely should've seen our wait time coming based on how many people were there. We waited 35-40 minutes for our egg puffs. That's a pretty long time for egg puffs.. In that time span, I walked to the bathroom, shopped at Sephora, came back and our order still wasn't ready lol.\n\n[Food]\nWe skipped the boba since everything looked like a sugary, glowy mess. The egg puffs were pretty solid! Crispy around the edges and soft in the middle. We had ordered the original batter egg puffs, the yoshi puffs and the double taro puffs. These definitely reminded me of taiyakis! I like how the different flavored batters weren't overly sweet and that all of the egg puffs were filled.\n\n[Worth it???]\nIf there's not a line, go for it! Their egg puffs are actually pretty good. I'd come back for sure. \nIf there is a long line though, just go to Quickly's right across the way for some egg puffs and more of a selection for tea.", "author": "Audrey G."}

I was intrigued to try this place out but opted to skip out due to long line. First of all, they need to fix their menu. All the names they had in their menu sound so complicated and unfitting. The eggetts are not worth the price. It's just too thick and lost the original eggetts taste. The flavors are overwhelming and sometimes taste burnt. They only have 4 machines hence the long line and crowd. \n\nNOW for the drinks...I used to be obsessed with 'Pink Lady' (strawberry with milk). I had it about 4 times already & nothing happened to me. But my boyfriend had it once and an hour later, he threw up everything he ate. We suspected that it was the drink since all he had was rice & chicken popcorn from Quickly. Today, I bought one for my mother and about an hour after drinking Pink Lady, she became dizzy and started throwing up. There's something about this drink that I would advise everyone to be cautious of. Maybe the milk or the fruit isn't fresh. Avoid Pink Lady from the menu!", "author": "Melanie W."}

It was still quite busy at that time since it was \"Hot and New\" so everyone was eager to try it out as was I. I didn't get any of the drinks but did get two of the egg-puffs since that's what this establishment seems to focus on anyways. It's quite unique how they serve some savory ones so I tried the taro one that's sweet and the pork kush one that's savory.\n\nUnfortunately, what I got was poor quality for sure. It takes so long to make one and the line was so long that the employees were for sure rushing and didn't even fully cook the egg-puffs. They ended up having that soggy undercooked felling, especially the taro one. I do appreciate there was real taro paste in it but it was quite sparse. Some pieces had a lot while some had none. Same with the pork kush where most of the pork was sprinkled off to the side and the rest of it was plain original egg puff flavor. The pieces that did have the pork kush were delicious and I did prefer it over the taro one.\n\nOverall, I was sadly disappointed. I'll consider going again once the hype dies down and there's no line anymore. Hopefully the quality will be much improved when there's no crazy crowd rushing the employees.", "author": "Lily F."}

My personal favorites are the double yammie, the yoshi bean, and the pork kush seaweed. \n\nThe wait time can be quite long because it's a hot and new place, plus it takes some time to cook the eggettes, but I get that, I don't mind. Customer service was also good, so can't really complain about that.\n\nHowever, what's disappointing is that they recently changed the eggettes into waffles. What? Why? Well, apparently a few of the customers have been complaining that the eggettes weren't crunchy enough and I beg to differ because I quite like the eggettes version better.

I'm more into the savory eggettes than the dessert ones but that's just personal preference.\n\nChick-yaki and the pork with furikake are my favorites. Drink wise, I love the four seasons oolong with salted cheese.\nI've also tried the Galaxy as well. The galaxy is very pretty and very good. My only preference is that I'm not too big on fruity tea drinks and the Galaxy is a strawberry flavored tea. I got it for the picture however I can acknowledge that if I was a fruity tea lover, I would like it a lot. Lastly, I've tried the Mangodo and I thought this one was going to be a weird combination between a Avocado and Mango smoothie, however it actually worked out really well together and is now my 2nd favorite drink there.\n\n\nI work as an Assistant Manager at Marugame Udon next door so I know the struggle of opening up and being incredibly busy with an inexperienced staff. Yes it can be frustrating to have to wait a long time for your order, but from my observations, they only have 4 eggette machines and most people order more than 1 eggette so orders can take pretty long to come out. On top of that, the staff has been doing it for less than a week (at least at the time that I'm writing this review) so my recommendation is that unless you're getting just a drink, you should only come here if you have about an hour to spare. \n\nImprovements come over time and while they're still in their growth period, I hope they are able to solve everything in the future to achieve something closer to a smooth and consistent style of service.", "author": "Thien L."}

Upon my first puff, I thought it had a distinct Oreo flavor, though as I started picking pieces away from the edges, I can now see that it doesn't have as strong a flavor.  There are pieces of coconut flakes in the batter mixture which I did not care for at all.  I don't think the coconut flakes should be in an Oreo flavored item as Oreos don't have any coconut in them.

The waffles are very crunchy and unlike having, for example, the chunks of taro inside the egg puffs holes, they entirely smash it with waffle batter and I honestly love it. However, I've been buying from this place for a long time and the waffles changed of texture and taste. At the beginning it was a perfect crunchiness with a bit of soft parts, but now it is entirely crunchy. I feel like I'm eating chips! The employees should really focus on setting a timer and making the waffles with 1:1 crunch and soft ratio. I noticed they just slightly open it, see if it's sticky, and close it again.\n\nI've also tried the majority of the drinks and the best one from the menu is the classic milk tea. All the other flavors are very basic. The bottle with the lights are way too hyped up. For example the galaxy drink taste like a drink I can get in any local store. Not saying its bad but I wouldn't get it again.\n\nIn regards to the waiting time, expect to wait 30 min to an hour for the waffles in busy hours usually around when the kids are off school all the way until closing time at 8 or 9 if I'm not mistaken.\n\nI'm giving them 3.5 stars because this place really try to satisfy their customers. The only tip I can give them is that they should consider going back to making egg puffs and filling the holes with batter AND the toppings (purple jam, taro, chocolate and banana, etc) and not completely stuff the holes with JUST chunks of topping. More topping doesn't necessarily mean it's better. Balance is key.\n\nReview is so long but I really love this place and they're doing their very best and I see and admire them. Staff is excellent. Very friendly. Waffles, not really.", "author": "Kathy D."}

I told them that I've been in line for 10 minutes already and no one came to tell us. The girl said she told someone in line already that they were getting ready to close.

Couldn't wait to final have more variety of egg puffs closer to the SFSU campus. They did just open, so give them a chance to settle in and work out the kinks. \n\nMy friend and I tried their S01 (Galaxy) and S02 (Rainbow), which I believe were the only two special drinks that came with the lights on the bottle. I had my Galaxy drink with the magic boba--a tea-soaked crystal agar type boba that gave it a crunchy texture. Though it was a little too sweet, the ice eventually melted to dilute the sugar. I think in the future they'll start to add drink adjustments. Just because they recently opened and might still be practicing how to make drinks at a high and fast demand. \n\nFor the egg puffs, we ordered the Oreo Star: a black-colored dessert with crunchy star cereal on every puff. Honestly this was great. The texture and quality was consistent with each individual egg puff and was not too sweet, though if you're expecting it to taste like a 100% replica of an Oreo you should only think about tasting more of the cookie instead of the creme. \n\nOur wait time seemed average for a fairly new dessert/boba shop drawing in the attention of customers like moths to a flame. About 15-20min in line to get to order and another to wait for our drinks and food--perhaps a little longer depending on how many people are in front of you.

Ok I've seen a million egg puffs made: eggettes, hk dessert cafes, all over Asia and no one, NO ONE does this excruciating process. First they have all their premade batter in pitchers and then they pour it into a tiny cup, then bring the cup of batter to the egg puff maker and pour the pre measured batter onto the iron and then they use a scraper to smooth over the iron as if it wasn't going to just fill the other spaces on its own because it's freaking liquid and liquid will fill up empty space. Then they wait til it's done and they cut off excess crispy (which I usually don't mind having as it's extra pieces but I guess they want it to look perfect). Then lastly, they use a fan to cool it down -___- not even for just a few seconds but I actually watched mine sit there for 2 mins.

They have extremely bad customer service and bad organization. They took sprite and added color. They also added too much  sweetener and it didn't taste good in general. It was legitimately disappointing and it was worst quality boba that I have ever eaten. In fact, it had the consistency of rubber. If there was a zero star, this is what I would rate it that!!! Didn't try the eggettes. The prices are pretty cheap though, which was a surprise to me.", "author": "Emi T."}

The drinks tastes mediocre. I saw a staff member dig thru the trash and didn't wash her hands only changed gloves. Ew.

We came to Eggxotic on a Thursday afternoon at around 6:00pm and it was crowded. We waited for awhile in line to purchase our food and drinks. There were a few people complaining for the wait and tried to get their refunds because they can no longer wait for their eggettes. I have no complains on the wait for the drinks because it was quicker than the eggettes. I literally waited for ONE HOUR for just one order of Double Yam eggettes. If I knew the line was that damn long, I probably wouldn't have purchase the eggettes. It was nothing special and I felt like I wasted an hour of my time. The girl taking order was very kind and sweet, but the girls working at the eggettes station literally look like they were taking their sweet time. I understand that eggettes takes time to cook but the workers look so chill. Like why aren't you guys cleaning up the mess? Not gonna lie, the eggettes station looks like a mess. The drinks overall was a disappointment. The Pink Lady drink tasted like 80% milk and then 20% strawberry. The Galaxy drink was SO sweet but the glow in the dark was very cool. The Rainbow drink was SO sweet too. It seems like all their drinks are very sweet, like 110% or something. Probably not going to be back again because of the long line and how unsanitary they are.", "author": "Jinnie W."}

I was already disappointment by it. The taste of the Oreo flavor was even worst. It had coconut inside and the Oreo flavor did not taste like Oreo. Wasted my time and money on this place. My first time but also my LAST time here.", "author": "Donna D."}

What i don't like is how i was sipping my drink and a fatass lemon chunk flew into my mouth. Yea fresh lemonade is always better but atleast strain it beforehand.", "author": "Nathan P."}

I can only say this for the drinks, i didn't bother getting the egg puffs because it was a 50 minute wait. I saw the way that they make the drinks and I can't believe what I saw. I believe they have a rainbow fading drink with butterfly pee DONT BUY IT! Save your money,buy a sprite and add some water. I thought in my head when I tried it that it tasted like a watered down Shirley temple. Once I saw how it was made it really just is . They add water, sprite, and some strawberry flavoring. That was already bad enough then I saw that they use the same mixing spoon over and over leaving it on the counter and using it again without washing it.", "author": "Destini N."}
