My brother wholeheartedly appreciated the duck while I was a huge fan of spicy fish. The walnut shrimp was also very tasty, better than the ones I've had in the Sunset.\n\nRemember they really pack on the spice here so if you've got a weak spice tolerance, let them know! \n\nWaitress was super sweet and gave recommendations on each page, depending on our tastes.

Starving, we ordered 4 different things: (Not spicy) Fish stew, pea sprouts, dan dan noodles, and spicy wontons.\n\nThe fish stew was significantly bigger than I thought it would be and it was pretty good with nice flavor and delicious flakey fish. Not spicy at all. Was perfect for the cold weather outside. The pea sprouts were phenomenal and that garlic they cook it in was the star of the dish. Nice to see this restaurant offering pea sprouts at a reasonable price. Dan dan noodles were tasty and had that signature szechuan spice, where it's clear and tingly, but doesn't hurt. It just kind of is there to brighten up the flavor. The spicy wontons were average. Always a good choice, but didn't blow me away.\n\nOverall, a very good spot for Szechuan food in the Richmond district, especially if you're in the area and not trying to wait a long time for a table.", "author": "Phillip V."}

There aren't too many spicy Chinese restaurants in the city overall, so we're glad to have a delicious option when we're craving spicy Chinese food. \n\nTheir boiling fish hot pot is really popular, and for good reason. For people who aren't familiar with Chinese food, they bring it out on a small, personalized burner that keeps the dish hot while you're eating it. This makes the dish more interesting and delicious because the longer the broth is simmering, the more flavorful the dish becomes. Note: they are not joking around with the peppers. It's going to burn going in and coming out. Highly recommend. \n\nWe've also tried the following: \n- hot wonton spicy soup: pretty good, but we've had better (pretty average, wouldn't get it again)\n- pan fried lotus: they slice the lotus very thin and after it's fried, it almost taste like a lotus chip; would get this again\n- chef's special fried chicken: it's good but has a lot of bones and skin\n- pan fried frog & vegetable combo: pretty good, but we've had better\n\nOverall, we're happy to have this restaurant close by! However, it's not quite a five because there hasn't been any outstanding dishes. \n\nLastly, the service has been really great every time we go. They even gave us free pumpkin sesame rice cakes the last time we visited! This dish is delicious but very calorically dense...probably not worth ordering because there's better items to spend your calories on :)", "author": "Yuchen L."}

It was a little warm in the restaurant, but not enough to not enjoy being there. I appreciate that Sichuan Home knew what their best dishes were and really advertised those! We ordered some of my personal favorites and I did not love the way they were cooked here. The Chongqing Chicken was mostly breading. I'm used to having a good amount of meat, but this didn't have much meat to it. A lot of the pieces were just gristle or fat deep fried in batter. It was pretty heavily salty too. The beef stew we ordered was good, but I felt like it wasn't as flavorful as it should have been- especially the beef. If I took a piece of beef out and bit into it without a lot of the other stuff, it just tasted like roast beef. It's almost like it hadn't simmered for a long time for all of the flavors to really seep in? I'm not completely sure. \n\nOverall it was a great experience, it just wasn't the best Sichuan food I have personally had. However, I would recommend for anyone to give them a try!

Not sure how we never noticed before.\n\nI'm sure that Sichuan Home has some dishes they do very well. The servers were very nice, the restaurant was clean and smelled good, and most of the stuff coming out on plates looked good. But, unfortunately, I can only review what I tried. What I ordered was basically just our sichuan go-tos, and I'll address them individually.\n\n\nChongqing Style Chicken (explosive chili chicken, la zi ji) - Texture was unusual. Most places don't use this kind of breading, and I think it's better without. These were kind of halfway between the usual texture and a western-style chicken strip. The flavor was fine, and they give a lot of chicken. 3.5/5\n\nDan Dan Noodles (tan tan) - The dan dan at Sichuan Home were definitely the weakest link for me. There was a lot of ma and not a lot of la going on. In other words, very numbing/tingly but not much else going on. Also, the ultimate noodle sin - mushy noodles. 2/5\n\nPea Sprout in Garlic Sauce (dau miu w/ garlic) - This was exactly as expected. Hard to mess up too bad, but hey, credit where credit is due. 5/5\n\n\nAll in all, I want to try some different dishes. I think that my standard order is not their strength.

I don't do well with spicy food but came anyways since my friend was craving their fish stew.\n\nTo be honest, most of the menu was full of spicy dishes, so I didn't have a huge selection to choose from. I ended up going with an order of chicken wings ($10.95) as well as a bowl of their chicken and corn soup ($7.95).\n\nThe chicken wings are dipped in batter, fried, and served in a wooden tray with nice presentation. Sprinkled on top are a lot of what tasted like garlic bread crumbs, which added an extra crunch and some garlicky flavor to the chicken wings. The chicken and corn soup was sweet rather than savory, which threw me off a little bit as I was expecting something savory, but it was still good.\n\nMy friend ordered the fish stew from the chef's specials page of the menu. It was extremely spicy, and she had to stop maybe 1/3 of the way through. She seemed to really enjoy it, so I would recommend this dish for the spicy food lovers out there.\n\nMaybe it was because the restaurant was pretty empty, but our server was very attentive and checked in on us multiple times throughout the evening.", "author": "Dianna H."}

My meal also came with complimentary side seaweed and spicy cabbage (similar to kimchi). \n\nMy waitress was very friendly and got my dishes quickly. I didn't quite get why ppl raved about that fish stew, It was average IMO. The green beans and the pan fried baos weren't too bad but they were nothing to write home about.\n\nTowards the end of my meal, I discovered a string of hair in the complimentary side dish. I pointed it out the the wait staff. They just brushed it off and asked if I wanted a new one. I said no. Then they brought my bill, around $37 including tax. I asked if they could do anything about it b/c there was hair in my food. He said no because the hair was in the complimentary side dish. Interesting. If I find a hair in a side dish, then it is only logical to question the rest of the food they serve, no? \n\nI paid for my bill, left a small tip, and left.

Since moving out to the bay area, we have been searching for a restaurant like the one we had in Philly and I can finally say we have found it. The spicy levels were perfect and off the charts here. Those dan dan noodles will really clear up your sinuses - it's massively packed with spice so don't order this if you are even the tiniest bit squemish.\n\nFood:\nWontons in spicy sauce - yummy! I couldn't stop eating these. The pork filling was delicious. The sauce was medium-hot.\nHoney walnut prawns - I didn't want to order this but my husband insisted because he loves the creamy mayo sauce. I ended up loving this dish too. It was a good balance to the other spicy dishes we ordered and gave us a little palate cleanser from the heat.\nDan Dan Noodles - WOW was this spicy. Way more spice than I expected and man it was soooo good. My mouth was on fire, I kept pounding the water, my body temperature felt like it rose a few degrees, and both my husband and I were sweating. And yet neither of us could stop eating this dish.\nCumin style beef - So flavorful; jam packed with cumin and pepper flakes. The beef was so tender. This dish wasn't super spicy even though it looked like it would be with all the red pepper flakes but it was so full of flavor.\n\nOnly downside was that it was just the two of us and we really wanted to order more food but was too stuffed to do so. I highly recommend coming with a few more people so that you can order more dishes and then share family style. \n\nThe menu was huge and a little overwhelming. But it did have lots of pictures which helped with ordering. \n\nService was really good too. It felt homey and the ladies were so nice to us. They even gave us a little dessert and extra rice with our to-go boxes, all on the house.\n\nIt's a really small restaurant so I could see this place having a long wait on the weekends.

That was enough research for me and it was 5 minutes away. We were going to get the fish and some chow mein. When I ordered I asked what type of fish they used. I just wanted to know for reference what I was eating. She immediately said that it's frozen and that some people like frozen and some prefer fresh, but if we wanted fresh fish, the price went to $38 from about $17. She said it's \"just a little bit more\", but that it cost them more for fresh fish. \n\n$38 might be the going rate for that dish in SF. That's ok if it is. But, I chose Sichuan House because they had the dish that I was looking for at a decent price and their reputation. If the menu listed frozen @ $17 and fresh @ $38, that would have been fine, but I didn't appreciate the up-charge.\n\nI didn't want to spend that much and was annoyed about the situation.

It wasn't as sour as I hoped it would be but it was delicious. The pan fried dumplings were alright. I was kinda hoping there would be soup in them but they were still pretty delicious, the bread wasn't too thick and the filling was just the right amount of flavoring.

It was really that serious. \n\nFirst time was a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. Luckily there was a table ready though the place was packed with big groups enjoying their lunchtime as well. Super authentic! Chinese families were gettin' down with wine and beer and the beloved lazy Susan. \n\nI have not had dan dan noodles in ages. A bowl by itself is large enough to be a huge solo meal. We shared the dan dan and pan fried chicken -- you can choose between boneless and bone in. We also ordered a plate of the garlic cucumber and a plate of the pan fried pork buns. Everything was literally 5/5. The food comes out quickly and so hot.\n\nDan Dan - 5/5 lovely chewy loooong noodles in the chili oil. It was more soupy instead of oily and perfectly done. \n\nPan Fried Pork Buns 5/5- the freshest and softest buns I've ever had. Meat is good, but the bun ins the star here. \n\nPan Fried Chicken 5/5- Simply amazing. We made sure to order this again on our second trip one week later. The dish includes these little bites of fried tofu that has a sour flavor and it's SO GOOD.\n\nGarlic cucumber 4/5- a little pricey for what it is, and I wish they'd add some spices but yummy nonetheless. \n\nSecond time around we had to wait about an hour on a Friday night. The place was packed. Definitely make reservations! We tried a couple new dishes --\n\nBeef Short Ribs - 5/5 similar to the pan fried chicken, but the tender beef pieces still makes it unique and not redundant in flavor. \n\nWontons in chili oil - 5/5 Some of the best I've had. Chili oil flavor is to die for and much different than the dan dan. \n\nThis is our new Chinese go to in the city.

Normally I an not a fan of spicy food, and of fish, but this dish made me experience what could only be described as a culinary orgasm. I should mention that I am very sensitive to spicy foods, but this dish still rocked my world. Even though it made the insides of my mouth burn hotter than the flames of hell (not really though, it was just a tiny bit spicier than hot cheetos), my tears were not of pain, but of joy. This is the best chinese fish I have had in my life (no joke). As an added bonus, the fish had NO BONES. This is a must.\n\nDan dan noodle- 4/5\nThis dish is good, but there's nothing really special about it.\n\nChef's special spicy pettitoes- 3.5/5\nWhile I didn't enjoy this dish too much, it wasn't bad either. This kind of dish isn't my style, but if you like these kinds of dishes you should definitely get it.

Taste was above average; I like the fact that they put a lot of those main ingredients inside, instead of a diluting soup like a lot of Chinese restaurant does.\n\n#Chicken and Red Chili Oil \u53e3\u6c34\u96de: B+.\nThis is a cold appetizer, have never tried this combination before (cold+spicy+chicken). It turned out okay. Chicken meat was pretty tender. The taste was actually slightly bland even from a person can't take spicy like me so if it can be a bit more chili oil it would have been even better.\n\n#Garlic Pea Sprouts: A-.\nNeeded to order some non-spicy food as a balance. Fresh vege, perfect timing of stir fry.\n\n#Chef's Specical Fish Stew: A.\nCan't believe I am giving an A on this super spicy dish! The spic level was quite high, and to achieve that the chef put A LOT of chili and other ingredients inside. By looking at how much ingredients they put to get the taste right you know this place is legit. The fish deeply absorbed the chili sauce and it was super spicy, but I don't know why I could keep eating it (and keep sweating of course) there must be some special formula the chef used to make that chili soup, but yea it was super good.\n\n#Mapo Tofu: A-.\nThis dish could be hit or miss - easy to make but if you don't pay attention to the details it will fail big time. And I loved how they made it there - heavy smell and taste, lots of red pepper and chili, and soft tofu. \n\nOne of the very few spicy food restaurants that I actually don't mind coming back again and again.

My friend and I each ordered a noodle (she got dandan noodle, and I got noodle pieces with pork) for $7 each, and we got a bowl of pig blood, intestine, spam and other interesting pieces for $12. Did not realize how big the noodle bowls were...It is definitely a lot for just one person. We barely managed to finish one bowl of noodles and had to pack the other ones to go.\n\nFlavor wise, I felt everything tasted very authentic, and since the servers were speaking in the Sichuan dialect, I am assuming that the chiefs are also from the are. The dandan noodles were mostly noodles and not so much soup, which is perfect because you can eat a lot without getting full quickly. It had the right amount of spice and flavor, and definitely do-able for even someone like me with a weak stomach. The noodle pieces (basically lumps of flavor shaped like noodle) with pork was also very tasty. The noodle pieces were very chewy, and the pork pieces were cooked very tenderly. A must try for Chinese food lovers!\n\nThe dish with pig blood and intestine also did not disappoint. The bowl had all shorts of things (pig blood, pig intestine, he mu er, spam, korean rice cake...). If you were to order the dish alone, definitely get a bowl of rice.

It may very well be worth your sanity. I came here to meet up with some friends. The drive from the east bay took about 30 minutes, but parking took about 40. \n\nSo back to my review... by the time i showed up, the food had all already been ordered... so I really couldn't tell you what we ordered since most of the items looked the same. From what I remember, the meats are mostly in some spicy red sauce with green peppers and chili peppers. There was a fried sweet potato dish which was quite tasty and a soy sauce chicken. I think 4-5 of the dishes after a while all tasted the same as they were all mixed up on my plate. I really did not know what i was eating after a while, but that didn't stop me none the less. \n\nIf you like sichuan or just spicy foods in general, this is your spot. Last but not least, this place is tiny and the waits are long. We had about 15 people in a table meant for 10, which made it very difficult to eat. So be prepared if you are in a big group...", "author": "Milton F."}

Even my brother and his wife (SF residents for over 20 years) were impressed.  We were trying to find dim sum at 3pm on New Years Day (good luck!) and after striking out at our usual spots we walked past Sichuan Home and decided to give it a try.  We were all so glad we did!   They quickly accommodated our party of 7 (there are two large family tables in the rear of the restaurant) and we had tea and Tsing Tao beers flowing within a few minutes. \n\nUnlike a lot of Chinese restos in the area, the menu we were handed was in English and had lots of high quality pictures making it easier for the kids to pick out what they wanted.  The waitress was also very helpful, making SURE we got the tastiest dishes (that also happened to drive the check up nicely but they were worth it!)\n\nEverything is quite spicy, so this is NOT the place to take your granny or small children that can't handle the heat.   But the spiciness is not overwhelming - the balance of herbs and other flavors is really well done, and I never found anything that was over-powered by the heat (unlike a lot of Thai places I've been!)\n\nOur selections:\n\nPan-fried pork buns (bao) - tasty filling of pork and green onion with a hint of sweetness.  Much better than the usual sticky-sweet dreck you get at a lot of dim sum places\n\nSoup dumplings - solid but not stellar.  (I'm spoiled by too many visits to Din Tai Fung around the world).  The dumplings had a nice flavor and the broth was good and rich, but they seemed to be filled about 1/2 way (\"flaccid dumplings\" my 15 YO son called them).  Unlike the ones you get at Din Tai Fun, these do not require a soup spoon to eat.\n\nKung Pao Chicken - as good an interpretation as I've had.  It's one of my wife's favorite \"classic\" Sichuan dishes and she said it was one of the best she'd had (lots of celery, onion, and bell pepper made it nice and crunchy.  Not too oily, with a great balance of heat and flavor with a light caramel-y sweetness.\n\nSpecial Fish Stew (see pic) - this was a crowd pleaser and DEFINITELY something you should try.  It was more than enough for our party of 7 (along with the other dishes) and was absolutely delicious.  The pot is full of a rich spicy red broth with mung sprouts, glass noodles, and other herbs and spices, topped by about a pound of fresh fish fillets and Cilantro.    They bring it to the table on a gas burner and allow it to finish cooking for about 5 minutes at the table.   It is served with a slotted spoon for pulling out the chunks of fish. The flavor of the broth was a complete mystery to me - normally I can make out the predominant flavors in even complex Chinese or Indian food, but this was something so new and unique to me that I am still wondering about it.  Absolutely a MUST-TRY if you are a Chinese seafood fan!\n\nGiant Clam Special - whole fresh giant clams are opened up, sliced thinly and then arranged back in the shells with tiny vermicelli type noodles and topped with a ponzu-like sauce and a generous helping of wok-fried garlic.   WOW.  Another AMAZING dish.  $7 each but worth every penny just to try!\n\nBlack Pepper Squid -  the kids love fried calamari, so we got this as a treat for them.  Everyone really ended up enjoying it.   Strips of squid (no tentacles) battered in a typical crispy light flour batter and then tossed in fried garlic and green chilies.   Another solid performance on a very typical Chinese restaurant menu item\n\nThere were a couple of other dishes, but these were the stand-outs.  Our bill with tax, tip, and SF healthcare tax came to about $180 for 7 people and we took enough food home for probably two more meals.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood and want to try something different than the usual dim sum fare (and enjoy spicy food) definitely give these guys a try - the service is great and the food is outstanding.   We'll definitely be back!", "author": "Brent C."}

I have been searching good Sichuan restaurant in SF, and X&Y is the only one that meets the standard so far. I was happy to find this one, since it looked it has authe tic sichuan food.\nHere is what happened about the food:\n We ordered about 9 dishes, from their signature Chili live fish fillet to delicate steamed xiaolongbao. I believe that the sample is good enough to rate the restaurant. \nFirst thing you will notice is salty !!!! I mean I am from northern China, who loves eating flavorful and salty food. But when saltiness is overwhelming, it's just bad. Overall the food is soulless and salty 1/10.\n\nOne dish they should never put on menu is \u6912\u9ebb\u9e21 \uff08maybe English name is chicken salad with Chili and peppercorn). What a shame!!!! It did not have any flavor from hot pepper and numbing pepper corn ). -1000000/10\n\nAnd the chef special sauteed chicken ( \u6cb8\u817e\u5c0f\u714e\u9e21\uff09 is very salty too. It didn't have the Sichuan signatures spiciness at all. It's such an\nover salty ordinary dish. 1/10\n\nThe live fish in Chili sauce ( \u6cb8\u817e\u9c7c\uff09is a different story. The Chili sauce  looked very red and spicy. But u could taste anything flavorful and spicy when u eat it. It tasted very mild and flavorless. I had suspicion that the Chili oil sauce is reused, which sounds horrifying:(.  And the fish tasted fresh, which is the few positive things. 1/10\n\nThe braised beef with noodle ( \u725b\u8169\u5200\u524a\u9762), i never had any noodle worse than this!  it's so mushy and soggy! it's the worse thing you can do to noodle!! The broth and beef is actually decent, but noodle is just too bad. 2/10\n\nCumin lamb, it was OK. It's just standard lamb, 5/10.\n\nXiaolongbao skin was bad, the same problem as the noodle. But the filling was not bad. This is also only thing I enjoyed eating, even though skin\nis kind of soggy.   6/10.\n\nService was average. It wad little better than average Chinese restaurant. \n\nThey have weird layout , you have to walk through the kitchen to use bathroom. It's not a pleasant walk for sure. The restroom had a disgusting odor , almost killed my appetite. \n\nI saw some Caucasian enjoyed their food , not the typical food we order. The table next to us ordered dumplings, fried rice, etc. I think for these general Chinese food, they might be doing OK. But when it comes to their so called Authentic spicy Sichuan food, I highly recommend you to go somewhere else. \n\n\u8fd9\u5bb6\u7684\u5ddd\u83dc\u505a\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u54b8\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u8fa3\u6912\u82b1\u6912\u9999\u5473\u548c\u795e\u97f5\u3002 \u5178\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u7528\u5fc3\u505a\u83dc\u7684\u9910\u9986\uff0c \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6df1\u5ddd\u83dcEater\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "author": "Pink M."}

We came here about 8p on a Friday night, and there was a little bit of a wait. I imagine at peak times, the wait gets kind of crazy.\n\nI liked the service here a lot. The ladies were really nice although full warning that one of them tried to upsell us like crazy on their specials that day, like the Lobster noodles special. I heard her do this to another table too. However, we wanted to stick to the basics. I think you can always tell how good a Sichuan place is by gauging certain classic dishes: the Chong Qing chicken (spicy chicken) and the spicy boiled fish fillet most especially. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Chefs special fish fillet\n- Spicy oil dumplings, or Hong you chao shou\n- Dan dan noodles\n\nThis was a good amount of food for two people and we did not finish everything. Everything was certainly spicy! The dan dan noodles were quite good, very spicy and not super peanuty. I actually like that style more so it was good. The noodles were thin though and I wish they were chewier but that's just personal preference. I probably would not get this dish again so I could try other things on the menu but it was good. \n\nThe spicy oil dumplings were decent too. Not the best I've ever had because the filling was not my favorite, but still good. The fish fillet though - oh man that fish fillet was really delicious and chock full of veggies (though we did add veggies). I'd definitely like to come back here and try some of their other dishes, like the sauteed frog legs in chili oil.", "author": "Lin Z."}

We were seated promptly with hot tea served. Ordered 3 things:\n- chef's special fish stew. They definitely tried to upsell us with the add-on veggies. We got the enoki mushrooms, which were super tasty and flavorful. The fish stew itself has great value - $18 for a gigantic amount, and lots of flavors, spaces, herbs, and very spicy for our request of \"just a little spicy\" version.\n- the \"little fries\" which contains thin taro, potatoes and chives slices. Very special, and tasty. Taro's texture was a bit hard for me. \n- hand-cut noodles with pickled veggies and pork. Great value again (huge bowl for $7), and super tasty, warming broth, al-dente hand carved noodles. They split the noodle soup into two bowls for us, one with pork and one without, which is very sweet of them. \n\nFor the two of us, we took most of the fish stew home as the portions were huge. That fish stew was also a great thing to re-cook and add all the veggies you want for a second meal. It was also quite spicy, but not numbing as this dish wasn't cooked with the numbing pepper. \n\nThe meal came with a pickled cabbage and konbu (seaweed) appetizer. And a mung bean soup for dessert. Both great. \n\nOne thing worth mentioning is Sichuan Home was on the Michelin bib gourmand list for 2013, 2014, and 2015.

This time I noticed from a \"lunch special\" menu taped on the window.  When I tried to order one of the dishes on that menu, the waiter said they don't have a \"lunch special\" menu anymore.  They should take it down if that's the case.\n\nSo I decided to order the chicken noodle soup because the photo on the menu looked enticing.  BIG BIG MISTAKE!  When the dish arrived it looked nothing like the photo.  There was barely any chicken pieces and some of the pieces were the chicken neck flattened to disguise it from being part of the neck. The chicken bones were fractured so tiny pieces of bone were dropping into the soup. None of the 5 chicken pieces were longer than an inch.  Definitely the worse chicken I've ever had.  I swear the chicken were the rejected scrap chicken pieces that didn't make it to other orders.  \n\nI have to seriously think again if I want to go back there.  Definitely avoid the chicken noodle soup dish at all cost.\n\nIf I went back and ordered the dan-dan mein dish again would I be disappointed?

Whether you enjoy fine dining, casual comfort food, or regional cooking, there is always something for your palate in the City.  \nMy uncle recommended this small neighborhood restaurant that specializes in Sichuan fare and invited other family members to a recent Sunday night dinner.  Getting off work a bit late on Sunday, I arrived to a table already filled with my relatives and food.  I munched from the various plates that were already served.  Here is a summary:\n\nGood\n1) Fish soup (requested not spicy) - Very flavorful and sweet, soft textured fish fillet meat in a clear broth.  \n\n2) Xiao Lung Bao - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1kqiFhK_YPAI_biQ5SAzEw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) Not sure whether this was delicious because I was famished or the dumplings being served piping hot in the steamer.  There was a decent broth amount in each dumpling (ate two).\n\nOkay\n3) Twice Cooked Pork - Popular Hunan dish that had decent flavor, but not much character as everything was brownish.  Could have used some veggies to give more texture.\n\n4) Szechuan Rice Cakes - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=l1MzUcloh9PTf5PG9rxQTA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) Made spicy, the rice cakes reminded me a bit of elongated gnocchi.  Must eat while hot (temperature) as the rice cakes harden when cold.\n\n5) Crispy Tea Smoked Duck - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ot7pGsqQUVy6kjoUd-z3mQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)\n\n6) Thai style Shrimp rolls - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fBZKgbU6N4GRWP5SNYkqaA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) \n\n7) Sliced noodle and Beef - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ezn9sKmoQlflanGPwOwG3g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) Everything about this was very plain... meat, noodles, and broth.\n\n8) Shrimp kebab in hot sauce - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9-Uk5UzpWkP5FStzsjI-fA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)  Again, nothing memorable... flavor, texture.  Be careful when eating as the fluids in the heads will spurt upon biting.\n\nMy cousin who coincidentally is a fellow Yelper asked me about my star rating during the meal.  Being diplomatic, I told her that I wasn't sure yet.  The service was prompt and efficient as the dishes were quickly carted out in rather speedy intervals.  I added the rice cakes late in the meal and it arrived within five minutes.  The chef probably noticed the number of dishes that we ordered and generously prepared us a complimentary dessert of red bean paste pumpkin rolls.

It's definitely a place where I know I could order something I usually don't like but end up enjoying it anyway.\n\nHighlights:\n\nChongqing Fried Chicken: I order this at every Szechuan I go to and Sichuan Home has my favorite.  It's fried perfectly and has just enough spice to kick in that numbing sensation just a little.  Portion is pretty good and you can add fried green beans to the dish for $3.  Highly recommended.\n\n\"Chef's Special Fish\": This is probably what I'd consider to be the specialty at this restaurant, and it comes in a few varieties.  Every time I've been here the fish has been perfectly cooked to be firm to the chopstick but soft to the tooth.  The broth is quite spicy but very flavorful.  Highly recommended.\n\nAs with most Szechuan restaurants you definitely need to order rice to temper the savory saltiness of the food.  Service isn't perfect but is generally friendly.  Prices and portions are about average.  Bring a hungry stomach.", "author": "Brandon W."}

It's a nice change after have eaten in  many so greasy Chinese joints in the Richmond neighborhood.\n\nThe first thing I try when I go to a new Chinese restaurant is  Kung Pao chicken. Sure it's a classic but it will give you a very good idea how the kitchen operates and if they use the real wok which is my opinion is the key and the main reason why you wold go to the Chinese restaurant at the first place.\n\nThe wok is how here! It roars in the kitchen and the result is a tasty, slightly spicy and nicely seasoned food.\n\nSome of the food I tried and really enjoyed: \n\n1. Kung Pao chicken.\n2. Green beans with pork\n3. Eggplant...classic\n4. Pork in bay leaves.\n It does have a lot of chilly peppers and chilly oil and it is delicious. \n\nWhat I would skip is the fish dish... more bones then I like. \n\nThe service is OK.

I came here for dinner with my parents and their friends, and because we didn't do the ordering and my knowledge of Sichuan food is pretty limited, I'm not entirely sure what exactly I was eating.

Maybe Sichuan food just isn't my jam because I really didn't think the place was that amazing? The food was fine, but I felt like at the end of the day, the food itself was pretty flavorless because it was spicy. I can eat spicy food no problem, but this food was just spicy--like the spiciness was the flavor. So if you don't find it actually spicy, then it's just like shoving bland food down ... so I wasn't a huge fan. Moreover, the spiciness wasn't the traditional ma la that you expect from Sichuan food at all. \n\nWe got a variety of the fish dishes, beef tongue, lots of stuff.

The more authentic ones usually have that numbing aroma flavor, but this had none of that. They also put beansprouts and some glass noodles on the bottom (That's a first I ever had it like that). The portion was HUGE though. But yeah, sorry, taste wise I've definitely had way better.\n\nI also ordered string beans with minced beef as string beans is one of my favorite veggie dishes. The beans came out to be another disappoint, too. It wasn't crunchy as it should be.

Mmm.\n- The dry hot pot with lamb, potatoes and lotus root is addictive and perfectly spiced. The lamb meat was the best I've had in America. (It's been tough and dry at other Chinese restaurants, but this one wasn't chewy or gamey at all -- just like in China.)\n\nWe also ordered cold rice noodles (great to start with, they arrive right away) and a separate spiced lamb dish (fantastic).

The menu is massive and decorated with many pictures of food that make you salivate. \n\nI've had some of these dishes-\n- Chef Special Fish Stew: added tofu per hostess recommendation and loved it. Spicy! Lots of fish fillets and great taste.\n- Spicy Tea Smoked Duck: very smokey but the duck was very tasty. Served with red chili peppers but not that spicy in my opinion. \n- Sauteed Lily Bulbs & Celery & Gingko Nuts, Cashew Nuts, & Macadamia Nuts: tasty veggie dish to accompany all the spice. Ample amount of nuts and greens. Very good.\n- Chicken Wing & Special Sauce: very good! Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Couldn't stop eating these.\n- Pork Stuffs & Eggplant In Garlic Sauce: another veggie dish that offered relief from the spices. eggplant is cooked in long slices, which is something I'd never seen before.\n\nThe only thing I've tried that I recommend to skip is their Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup dumplings). XLB's is not part of Sichuan cuisine so it's understandable that they didn't taste authentic. \n\nAlso wanted to add, the main hostess / server lady is absolutely hilarious! She is loud and always tries to upsell daily special dishes to you. She's very good and got us to add tofu to our fish stew dish, which we ended up liking very much. She's got a great personality though. I'd go back just to see her walk around and do her thing!", "author": "Jing D."}

The portions here are huge!!  Between two people, we had about half of the fish dish and bean jelly to take home. \n\nThe difference between that fish and the chef's special fish is that it has the ma la sichuan flavor (so we were told), which is really why you should be here anyway, so we ordered it over the chef's special. I wasn't too blown away by the flavor, but that could also be because we ordered it a little less spicy. It comes on a gas burner to keep it warm, with tons of fish chunks, bean sprouts, and even glass noodle. The snow pea leaves were also pretty standard, but what I really liked was the bean jelly. Again, huge portion with bits of ground meat and hard bean curd, it was sooo good.\n\nBathrooms are in the back, through the kitchen, so you can walk by and have a glimpse/smell of what they're wok-ing.

We were seated and ordered a meat appetizer, Chinese broccoli, xiao long bao and the spicy fish pot.  First they gave us a plate of seaweed and vinegar/spiced cabbage. Wasn't a huge fan of that but it's on the house! Meat appetizer was really good, perfectly salted with spices and vinegar. Chinese broccoli nice and crunchy. Xiao long bao was delicious however I would've enjoyed it more if it had more soup. The seasoning of the meat inside the bao was soooo good but it was just missing the soup inside... The HUGE spicy fish pot consisted of LOTS OF ENOKI (my fav!) some fat clear (too chewy didn't like it) noodles and also some of the thinner clear noodles, fish, prob some other veggies I forgot about and lots of numbing spices. We got it regular spicy as opposed to spicy or extra. Now my spice tolerance is pretty high and I think regular spicy was just perfect. If we had gone \"spicy\" prob wouldn't have been able to handle it as well. The fish resembled something like the consistency of cat fish but the fish itself was kinda bland..prob be better with the fried version of the dish.\n\nThe asian ladies who took our order was very attentive to our needs. She made sure to tell us on several occasions that the fish was ready (basically telling us to hurry the eff up and eat it otherwise it won't be as good) and when I dropped the ladle and made a splash she said \"are you ok? \"And \"sorry\" as she was walking by as if it were her fault (haha super cute) When she was taking away our empty plates we still had a couple peices of the broccoli on our plates and she was like \"oh take your time eat everything\" (typical asian mom) \n\nAll in all I really enjoyed the food here and would come back to try other dishes!

Following Patricia Unterman's advice (http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/sichuan-home-off-to-a-smashing-start-in-san-francisco/Content?oid=2179482) we ordered the spicy wontons (chili oil wontons), sliced noodle w/ beef (dao chow noodles), chef's special vegetable combo (lotus root, taro, chives). When the dishes came out I knew we were in trouble. The vegetable combo is huge. It's just piled onto a big serving plate. The spicy wontons come in a bowl for 2 (approx 15 wontons) and the sliced noodles came in an even bigger soup bowl. \n\nThe vegetable dish was crunchy heaven. The taro roots had been sliced into matchsticks and then fried in such a way to be crispy and crunchy - like when you have taro root chips. It felt so healthy and light that it seemed impossible for it to be so tasty too. Probably my favorite dish.\n\nThe wontons were yummy and delicate. Went really well with the mildly spicy broth. Real Chinese soul food.\n\nThe sliced noodles and beef were super sichuan spicy. I'm not sure how they get that spiciness to permeate the beef because I didn't find any sichuan peppercorns in the bowl. Be aware that though it's \"beef\" it's Chinese style beef which is stew meat with assorted cartilage/tendons/etc. Since I like to chew on things this was fine by me but hubby wouldn't eat anything that wasn't meat.\n\nNeedless to say there was no way for us to finish all of this.

I could imagine this restaurant earning 5 stars in the future after I've sampled more of the menu. \n\nI arrived at 10:06 PM after Outside Lands, and I expected them to be closed already, since 10 PM is the posted closing time. However, they seated me, and then another couple groups after me up until about 10:30, so I suppose the real closing time depends on demand and how the staff is feeling on an individual night. This earns them points in my book, because some Chinese restaurants stop seating a half hour BEFORE the posted closing time, which I find infuriating. \n\nThey brought out a couple \"banchan\" like items to the table when I was seated. I believe they were seaweed and a mildly pickled cabbage. This isn't typical at Chinese restaurants, so it was a welcome gift. There is also complimentary tea, as you'd expect. \n\nI asked for recommendations of the spicy, Sichuan specialties of the chef, and the server ticked off some of my classic favorites, such as Szechuan Style Spicy Chicken (La Zi Ji, but boneless), Sliced Beef in Hot Chili Oil (Shui Zhu Niu Rou), and Fish Fillets in Hot Chili Oil (Shui Zhu Yu). \n\nWhen she mentioned the Spicy Tea Smoked Duck, and I knew I had to try it. The duck is smoky, almost ham-like, and it is bone-in, so there is a lot of picking around involved in the eating. If you enjoy La Zi Ji, then this is up your alley. In this case, the duck isn't breaded, but it is stir-fried in the wok with fresh green and dried red chilies, a well as ginger and garlic. It's wonderfully spicy and savory. My only complaint is that the duck was tougher than expected--I don't know whether it is always this way, or if my dish suffered because I ordered it at the end of the night. Only ordering it again, earlier in the day, will tell. \n\nI had expected to also order Sichuan wontons in chili oil (Hong You Chao Shou, literally Red Oil Folded Hands, here called Wonton Soup in Hot and Spicy Sauce), but then I saw Xiao Long Bao (here called Shanghai Style Steam Bun) on the menu. If you know me at all, you know I'm obsessed with XLB, so I had to try them here, even though this is a Sichuanese restaurant, not Shanghainese. The XLB were average, but not outstanding. Most critically they were short on the rich, unctuous, umami flavor that life-changing XLB possess. Next time, I'll try the Hong You Chao Shou instead, which I also love. \n\nService was attentive, even though the staff were eating their customary end-of-the-night meal. \n\nPrices are great, a little less than other Sichuan spots like Z&Y in Chinatown and Sichuan Fusion in Richmond. \n\nNext, I need to visit Sichuan Fortune House in Pleasant Hill, and then I can finally determine which \"Sichuan [living establishment]\" restaurant reigns supreme in my spice-lusting heart (and tummy).", "author": "Chris Z."}

It's a pretty small restaurant and parking in the area sucks (since it's by all the restuarants on Geary).  We came around 830 on a Saturday night and we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.  The waitresses were all really friendly and made sure not to rush us out even though we were still eating passed closing time.  \n\nOverall, the food was really good and the service was impeccable.  We had the fish pot (which is enough to feed like 5 people), the pan fried pork intestine, and some dumplings.  Everything was good, especially the pork intestine (if you're into that kind of stuff!).  \n\nIt'd recommend going with a bigger group so that you can order more and try a variety of stuff!  Also, this is a Sichuan restaurant, so expect most of the stuff to have some sort of CHILI or SPICE to it!  YUMMM!!!!", "author": "Jae W."}

It was very helpful in deciding what I wanted.  \n\nThe dish I really wanted was spicy oysters, but the photo showed the oysters swimming in a sea of red hot peppers.  That scared me off... I've eaten asian food too many times when it was too hot to enjoy.  I got the chicken instead.  The chicken came out covered in red peppers too!  Scarey... but it actually wasn't too hot at all.   It was actually perfect.  It was boneless chicken.. and as I ate through the large pieces, I started to discover some wonderful little extras in the sauce.  Whole garlic cloves, roasted soybeans... nice little touches.  \n\nI was so inspired by the menu, I'm going to have to come back here at least 10 more times to try things out.

I also asked the price of one dish on the wall(I didn't see it in the menu),  she even said why I always looked at the price in front of my friends,and asked them to never be my friends anymore(even though it was a joke which still made me embarrassed.

From what my wife said, this place is always full when she gets off work.\nSo we decided to get there. Right off the bat,  my wife isnt into spicy food, and NOW she knows what Sichuan aka Szechuan Chinese food is.\nOkay fine, practically everything in the menu was spicy, which to me is not a big deal- depending on how spicy it gets. What made it interesting were the types of dishes, the chef must be eclectic and very experimental because there were a lot of unique dishes not seen at other Chinese restaurants. It was fascinating to read and look at the pages. \nThere was a small section on the last page with traditional non spicy food if being cautious to spicy food is a priority...\nWe ordered Egg Rolls - basically your basic veggie eggroll and were good. \nMy wife ordered Crispy Duck, okay that was simple enough. Or was it. Besides meat there was some kind of peanut butter filling that turned the dish into a duck pie. It was very filling, it was pretty good. I guess the peanut butter was included to due the lack of duck meat. \nI ordered something that was kind of like Kung Pao Chicken, but it wasnt, more like a big brother. It was fried pieces of chicken (hopefully) with peppers, peanuts and some small pieces of I think were meat or tofu or both. All of this was on top of a bed of red chili peppers. The chef must have poured the ENTIRE bag of chili peppers into this dish. They had no flavor or bite to them which I suppose is a good thing so I can taste the food. It wasnt bad, but also nothing special. We also got the Yang Chow Fried Rice and this was disappointing. It smelled and tasted like it was salted fish which I cant stand, but it was probably the tiny shrimps. I felt it was lacking something, and the smell of it was more of *no thanks* than a \"come and get it\" \nOverall I thought it was average based on what we tried, there are probably other things I might or might not try if we go back. This is definitely not your typical Chinese restaurant and some of the dishes will depend on your taste. For me it was okay but it did give me a middle of the night digestive issue, some lovely indigestion and then some.. good thing I didnt have work the next day.. \nThe service was great overall when they werent playing on their smartphones...", "author": "David S."}

So many times I'm like no way they have to be fighting, but for example one time asking my chinese friend who was around he's all no, they were actually having a casual conversation.  \n\nWell these two girls were shouting back and forth at each other like lunatics the whole time we were eating, look I'm not even one to complain about noise AT ALL, even when I'm trying to sleep. But this got damn right uncomfortable. I was expecting at any second one of them to strangle the other. This didn't occur, but at least that would have made things more entertaining than awkward.\n\nAlso, before they started \"fighting\" (or having super casual conversation that sounds like fighting) my server girl was sitting on her laptop the whole time. When I needed her I'd look at her, but she was jus chillen at a table on her laptop (while she is the only server in the restaurant).\n\nFinally when it was time for our bill, she brought it. I gave my card. Then she returned it without running my card. Then had to wait 15 more minutes since she was on laptop for her to actually run it.\n\nIn the end the whole experience made me have a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively; resulting in the 1 star.", "author": "Belito L."}

The quality of their food is consistently good and truly authentic since I know for a fact that the owner is from Sichuan. Lol.... My personal favorite is spicy fish filet, but this is a bit on the more pricey side compared to other similar restaurants. My boyfriend's personal favorite is the deep fried chicken sticks (I forgot the name on their menu.) But it was very crispy, easy to eat & very very tasty. This is also a specialty dish that can hardly found somewhere else. \n\nI am from southern China, and I used to hate eating spicy Sichuan food as it is way too hot and it hurts my throat. But this restaurant is my flipper. As I started coming to this restaurant, I gradually open up to spicy food. I totally fall in love with spicy Sichuan food. I still can't take sour spicy food like southern Asian food though. \n\nAnother reason why I support this restaurant is the hard working work ethics and spirits of the owner. This is a typical family run business. The husband is the chef who works 7 days a week, and wakes up 4 am in every single morning to pick the freshest ingredients for his dishes in the local markets. The wife works as the waitress and cashier. They have not taken any day off since the day they opened this restaurant over 2 yrs ago. I sometimes think they are the superman/superwoman. I asked the owner why he won't hire another chef or assistant. He said it is very hard to find someone who would has the high requirement on the quality of food as he does. He wants to make sure every customer walk out of the restaurant with a big smile on their faces. He just can't risk the food to anyone else.

I got the frog legs in chili oil (which wasn't super oily/greasy), $13 pretax for a large portion.  Whenever I eat out I usually order 2 entrees because I exercise and eat a lot, but this time I only got one (plus rice and the free veg side of spicy cabbage and seaweed salad (and not the overly sweet, artificial weird radioactive green dyed kind)) and I left full.  I personally prefer some of the legs to be cooked a little less, but I suppose it's hard to control that since it comes in a stew.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the dish has \"oil\" in the title, it was more like a (spicy) stew, which I would sip with a bite of rice.  But! They just kinda cut the whole frog up, bones and all, so pay attention to what you are eating!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-11", "description": "If you're looking for a light, easy meal of dumplings and fried rice, you might as well stop reading here and never come to Sichuan Home. If you crave spice (and not just heat!), proper doneness in cooking, and well balanced flavors, then you should definitely come here.\n\nDespite my heritage, I am a huge fan of Sichuan food and for years now, Spices has been my go-to place. It wasn't always pretty, but at least the food was prompt and satisfying. But knowing that Sichuan Home is here means that I can never go back. My life is now divided into the period before I ate here and after. It's not a particularly impressive store front; decorations seemingly taken from a kitschy Italian trattoria and a clean, sparse interior belie the great service and spectacular food.\n\nEven if the service weren't prompt and helpful, even if the fresh squeezed juices weren't ridiculously delicious, even if their prices weren't extremely reasonable, I would still have to come back here. We started with the Couple's Delight, a mish-mash of tendons, tripe, stomach, and other cuts of meat tossed in oil and spices. Without a doubt, this is the best single rendition of the dish I've had. Good Sichuan-style food is as much about the flowery notes as it is about the intense heat and the flavor was spot on; a little bit of heat from the peppers, a little fragrant aroma from the oils, and a nice dose of crunch from some peanuts.\n\nOur red-oil wontons were really well done and miles better than the vinegar-doused version that Spices offers. Our main dishes included cumin spiced lamb (cooked with just enough pepper and onion for a slightly sweet and intriguingly savory flavor), the hot pot of fish (laden with vermicelli, bean sprouts, fungus, and rice cakes), and the chef's special chicken, which was skewered chicken lightly fried and then cooked in a fiery broth, also filled with bean sprouts and fungus.\n\nThe service was impeccable with nary a single empty tea cup and a gracious serving of freshly-made pumpkin cakes filled with red bean. As we packed up our few lonely leftovers, one of the waitresses came by to insist that we take some of the broth so that we could cook some fresh vegetables in it later.\n\nI've now spent all the energy I had writing this review and must retire to bed so that I can dream about when I'll be able to get my next hurts-so-good fix.", "author": "Marcus L."}

But the food--mapo tofu and spicy veg was oh so worth it.\n\nThe restaurant is relatively small -- maybe two large tables and five medium tables and the medium tables fill up quickly during dinnertime. On Friday evenings, it's best to arrive around 5pm because the tables fill quickly and there have been lines. If you happen to go during a busy time and there's only one or two in your party, the waitress may ask to fill the empty seats at your table with some folks standing in line.

So we opted for Sichuan Home.  Totally glad we did!  This place is great.  \n\nWe ordered noodle soup with beef (not spicy), noodle soup with pork (medium spicy), and pork dumplings.  The beef soup had HUGE chunks of tender beef in it.  I'm used to pho or pho-style soup having slices of beef, so this was a nice surprise.  It also had bamboo chutes and leeks in it.  The broth was light, but overall the soup was very filling.\n\nMy soup actually had very little pork in it, which was a little disappointing, but the broth and other stuff was great.  The noodles were thick, hand-cut szechuan-style noodles, and the soup also had kale and edamame in it.  The broth was flavorful and at the perfect level of spice (for me).  \n\nThe pork dumplings were delicious, and the sesame oil they served with it was the bomb.  \n\nAll in all, a pretty good place.  The service isn't that great, so if you need something you'll have to ask repeatedly for it.

The restaurant was full with tables of mostly young Asian twenty-somethings. The moment we walked in, the entire restaurant went silent and stared at us (clue #1 we are in a good place). The server quickly cleaned off a table and sat us near the door. At first glance of the menu, we realized we had actually found an authentic Sichuan restaurant. A moment of euphoria took over as I remembered the mouthwatering dishes of Sichuan province that I sampled a few years back. I had been looking for spicy chicken just like the little hole-in-the wall restaurant in Chengdu and I finally had found it. I also had my brother with me who has been living in China for the past seven years and fancies himself somewhat of a Sichuan expert. \n\nBetween the three of us, we ordered MaPo DouFu, Spicy Chicken (bone-in), Beef with Vegetables, potstickers, and egg rolls. I was blown away with the authenticity of the MaPo DouFu and the Spicy Chicken. My mouth was numb with the familiar burn of Sichuan chili oil and I loved it. The only disappointing dish was the beef with vegetables. My husband ordered it because he is a Mongolian Beef kind of guy and loves American-Chinese food. The vegetables were horribly disappointing as they were the frozen pea and carrot mix that once graced cafeterias across the United States. \n\nThe bill was $40 for three people for all the food we ordered. You should definitely head to this little restaurant in the Outer Richmond. You will not be disappointed with its authentic flavors; however, your mouth will be on fire from the chili oil.

I thought it would something like Peking duck.  It wasn't.  Something salty and cold which tasted like leftover food that you just grabbed out of refrigerator without heating it up.  However, maybe it is supposed to be like that.  For main course, I asked for a recommendation on the fish.  What I got was a big bowl of white fish with cabbage, dried chili, garlic completely drenched in diluted solution of chili oil.  Pretty much a soup of chili oil.  One piece of this would be ok.  The fish was actually good.  However, as a main course I don't think so.  After several bites, all you feel is chili oil.  And the weird thing is that is was not that spicy.  Well, again, maybe those are typical Szechuan dishes.  Not ordering rice was also a mistake.  It might have absorbed some of the oil.  Do your research when you come.", "author": "Pasha G."}

I really like trying different Sichuan places all over, so I had certain expectations about the cuisine.  This place had a very boring beef noodle soup, with thin weak broth and tough beef.  The worst was the spicy fried fish.  At most places the batter used is a magic mix of spicy and peppery sensations.  Here it was bland and the fish was dry and full of bones - to the point that it was just too difficult to eat.\n\nIs the food authentic?  I can't say.  But if it is, I imagine it being authentic food from a Chinese prison, village hospital, or Dickensian orphanage.\n\nGo to SPICES! or TASTE of FORMOSA instead.", "author": "Adam T."}

We came here after reading an article about this place calling it the \"best new Asian restaurant\" and seeing the promising reviews here. We are big fans of Szechuan flavor, but this was common at best.\n\nThe menu does not look impressive and the prices are high for this type of restaurant. Plates, even small ones, start at $11.\n\nAs soon as we ordered we got a small plate of pickled cabbage, celery, and carrots - nice gesture. By the way, the chopsticks here are made from hard plastic, which makes it hard to eat anything greasy (like everything here).\n\nThe small plate of Garlic Cucumbers was just cut cucumbers with garlic and floating in a sea of low quality chili oil.\n\nThe Chef's Special Fish Stew ($18.95!!!) was served in a baking dish with a spoon that kept sinking inside. We were never brought bowls or individual spoons or offered rice. The stew itself was covered with a thick layer of grease, the fish in it was slimy and flavorless, and the chili peppers were low quality. After few bites we asked for the check.\n\nOverall it was a very underwhelming experience. It made us appreciate \"Spices\" on 8th and Clement Ave so much more. \"Spices\" is the place to go for authentic Szechuan food, not here.", "author": "LJ I."}

We ordered the Chef's special fish and tofu in spicy sauce and it was delicious. There was SO much tender fish in the dish that we couldn't even finish it.

Get the one for $25, it comes as a hot pot with its own gas burner. (There is a picture of it posted by ChenTao X. at http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9MIVq95YYLQyGODDsdAbOA?select=WschM5D_LanLxSjFlYMSzA) The fish is delicate, plentiful, and the dish has plenty of yummies in it, like  glass noodles, black fungus, soy bean sprouts. I am a lover of spice, I've never had anything too spicy, and even I think they can totally turn up the heat.\n\nSoup-filled dumplings are good.\n\nThe spicy lamb dish is so-so. \n\nDo not get the spicy wontons or the smoked duck appetizer. The wontons are not good at all - I have no idea why there are positive reviews of it; my table of three did not enjoy. The wontons are thick, very little meat, and the hot oil is nothing special. I can make better wontons at home. I prefer my wontons to be delicate shells with generous amounts of meat. Maybe this is a north vs. south issue? The smoked duck is freakin' salty.\n\nThe spicy chicken that has bone-in (sorry, I forget the name here, it's a very standard Szechuan dish) is good: crispy, nicely flavored with spice and salt.\n\nDan-dan noodles are nothing special. \n\nThey do a number of cold dishes well, like the couple's delight.\n\nPlace is small, and can get a bit full, though I think a lot of people don't know about it yet. Fish here is superior to the fish at Z&Y, although the chicken at Z&Y is better. Metered parking, though you can find free street parking in the neighborhood if you search. Bathroom situation not so great b/c you have to go into the kitchen to get to it.\n\nService is reasonable, and if you speak Mandarin, you will get great service and perhaps a free item (sadly, I do not speak Mandarin).

Just because I can't handle spice doesn't mean I don't like the other flavors and styles of Sichuan food. \nThe house veggie platter was bizarre and great.  Crispy taro strips, strips of lotus root, green chives and some pine nuts.  Great textures... mild unique flavor.   Can't eat it too fast, as the crispy taro could poke your mouth if you're not careful.  \nGot Cumin lamb and asked for it to be made mildly.  Pretty great. I could have done with even more cumin flavor, but it wasn't overly oily, and no peppers at all.  \nNutritional Mutton soup was also a big hit.  I am a big fan of Chinese medicinal soups.  They are pretty hard to find in SF.   Big chunks of lamb/mutton (some more chewy than others), but I was really in it for the broth anyway.\nComplimentary seaweed and cabbage was good too, and until the bottom where the chili oil pooled, it wasn't too hot. \nI've noticed other reviews mention taming down some of their dishes so it looks like this is a good compromise for those of us who like everything about Sichuan food but the overly spiciness.", "author": "howard t."}

I figured I would check to see if they had any current deals and found a nice discount after searching for \"Sichuan home voucher\" on google. Turns out it is a small restaruant and nothing fancy... but the food was surprisingly good and wonderfully presented. The girlfriend thought the chefs special fish was very tasty, and if she loved it, that's good enough for me.", "author": "karry m."}

I am going back for lunch tomorrow. Sparkling Clean Dining area and Kitchen. I need to sample an entre before I say more about the food, but based on the soup I had I anticipate a great dining experience.", "author": "Mac M."}

Couple's Delight is one of my favorite Sichuan dishes. Its very good here. But when I tried take out, they gave me a smaller portion than I was expecting at pretty much $9 for that dish, I sort of felt a bit ripped off. Anyway, the fish in spicy soup had lots of fish in it, another expensive dish, but it really didn't taste all that good in terms of seasoning, just hot. Its marked as a special but to me I didn't care for it very much. They also had some taro and vegetable sliver dish, it was crunchy and pretty good. I'd come back but not very often as this place is expensive. Also its very hard to find parking around this area. I also don't like plastic chopsticks as its hard to hold food with them.", "author": "Dijon Y."}

We've tried so many new things and on occasion the chef's sent us out an extra dish just for good measure when we bring a large group- super nice. The variety of great spicy and non-spicy dishes makes it easy to please so many of our friends' palates. staff is great and you're never gonna leave hungry or broke when you eat here. They just celebrated their 1-year anniversary, congrats!", "author": "Aileen T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-03", "description": "Excellent food served family style on the larger 6 top tables.  Came with a group and got to try several dishes.  My personal favorites were the chef special fish (be prepared for hot, but tasty), red oil wantons, and the fried pumpkin.  I am just not Chinese enough to enjoy the bone in items - smoked duck, prawns, chicken in pot.  I know this is traditional Chinese style.  I just have a hard time separating the bones in my mouth", "author": "Wade T."}

The staff are so helpful and I have tried many new dishes, all delicious. Very reasonable prices too. There are so many mediocre Chinese restaurants in the Richmond district. We are pleased to now have Sichuan Home in the neighborhood. You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Beth C."}

I was looking forward to taking my sister who was coming in from Miami there since she cannot get great Asian food where she lives.  After reading other reviews I picked her up from the airport and went to Sichuan Home for lunch. The plate I was given to use had dried food on it-they apologized and did give me a clean one but it was not a great start.  I ordered Szechuan beef-the meat was  tough and dry. I could not eat it without risking the possibility of choking when I swallowed.  The steamed rice was limp and tasteless.  My sister ordered chicken with mixed vegetables and said that although it was not great, it was edible.  The wonton soup which we shared was watery and tasteless.  We did not bother to take home any of the left overs which I usually love for breakfast the next morning. So sorry I could not agree with previous reviews.", "author": "Rose G."}

It is a small place, but as they say, big things come in small packages.  The service is very friendly and prices reasonable.  They are very patient and answer any questions you have especially since it is an authentic menu with very little if not any Americanized dishes, but, not to worry, nothing out of the ordinary.  Not being in the mood, for spicy, we ordered everything a little spicy which to them met mild, but was still every bit as good, packing a little spice.  The pot stickers are crispy golden with a wonderful ground pork, cabbage, and ginger filling; perfect topped with a little soy sauce; the wrappers not too thin or thick.  The chef's special chicken is crispy and greasless with chili peppers and black pepper; a perfect amount of heat with dry fried goodness; I love the Chinese crackers accompanying it that have a very bready taste and remind me of Chitos as far as the shape and consistency.  The tan tan noodles, my favorite Szechuan dish are served in a chili broth with fresh peanuts, ground pork, and cabbage; not a chili sauce or peanut or peanut chili sauce like at other places; packed the right amount of spiciness.  I loved the green bean soup (not the green beans you would use in chili garlic sauce) for anyone discovering this dish; a lightly sweet soup of goodness.  So, for excellent Szechuan cuisine in a clean atmosphere with friendly service, Szechuan Home cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
