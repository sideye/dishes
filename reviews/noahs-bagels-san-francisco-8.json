As soon as it was my turn to order a Noah's employee girl behind the counter asked what I wanted to order.  I told her that I would like to order a Bagel's and Smear box (Baker's Dozen) with 8 Asiago Cheese and 5 Cinnamon Raisin Bagels.  She then proceeded to to box up the bagels into the Bagel box and then turned to me again to ask me if I knew how to count.  I asked her what do you mean?  She promptly told me you ordered 8 Asiago Cheese and 5 Cinnamon Raisin bagels correct?  I answered 'yes' and a baker's dozen is 13, correct?  I suppose she heard and  took in what I said with a blank look and asked me again if I counted correctly, which I answered again, 'yes' (Thinking to myself, why are we having a conversation about this topic?).  Hearing a few chuckles behind me I turned to see the other customers in the line behind me smile and shake their heads.  After the Noah's girl finally decided to finish up packing my box I proceeded to the cashier to pay for my Baker's dozen box.  This is a first, my family and I frequent this Noah's branch, being that it's located close to our home and all the employees here have been very cordial with great customer service IQ, until today.\n\nThe experience was interesting none the less, but it wasn't until I opened the box later to count the bagels is where I got a little chuckle.  The Noah's employee girl not only packed my baker's dozen order, but she packed 8 Asiago cheese bagels and 4 Cinnamon raisin bagels.  Wow, I'm speechless...  Noah's Bagels, it's not the fact that I'm missing a bagel or two, anyone can make a mistake and that's not a problem with me at all, but it's the issue of being forced to have an unnecessary discussion with a disgruntled Noah's Bagel employee on how to properly do basic addition.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-04-08", "description": "Haven't reviewed before - mostly just read other's reviews. Today, though I am irritated enough to write. First off, love the bagels. The issue this location has is with staff. \nStarted going to this location in 2013 and it had great staff - focussed, thinking, attentive; they were a well oiled machine.  About a year and a half ago that staff started to disappear. They were replaced in volume (6 people struggling to do the job that 3 did without breaking a sweat), but not quality. The new staff were always much more concerned with their last smoke break, next smoke break, how much they wished their smoke break was that moment, how much they needed a smoke break and/or the fact they were out of cigarettes.  As a result of this obsession, the staff rarely got orders correct - presumably because their brains were SO filled with cigarette woes, there was no room to remember to type plain bagel, toasted, with butter. Invariably, I would have to interrupt the cigarette discussion to say; \"no, not an onion bagel - plain, not cream cheese - butter\". I heard many other customers make the same kind of corrections. When at last my order would come out, I would frequently (think one out ever 5 times) discover in my car, or at work; that I had not received what I ordered (completely missing or incorrect).  So, someone else would get my food and I would buy something from a coffee place or whatever was near by.  Very frustrating to have to go back and request what I actually ordered or worse, to be too far away to exchange it and have to pay twice.\nEventually, I decided that I would check the bag before I left to make sure everything was there and/or correct. Often I was buying a half dozen, cream cheese and several individual bagel meals; so my name would be called, the large bag placed on the counter and I would stand there and pull everything out in order to confirm it was correct. I found several items which belonged in someone else's order, and several errors in my orders in general. Plus, the other customers in line were invariably glaring at me. \nFor the last six months or so my orders have been correct much more often (think one error for every 8 visits). So I was not unpacking the bag anymore, and rarely having to buy other food for myself. Progress!! Still regularly seeing someone who appears to be a manager, standing behind an employee reading the orders out to the person making them (not when they're busy) and then correcting the maker when they start to put the wrong topping on a bagel; so perhaps one or two employees have some literacy or cognitive issues?\nToday I ordered the smallest order I have ever made at this location; it only involved two bagels and a drink. When I got home, instead of the bagel sandwich ordered, there was a plain, toasted bagel. I drove back because the bagel was for someone else and had lox (more expensive than my plain butter). When I went in three different people tried to help me (two people I recognized, one I didn't - but got the impression of a new manager). All three employees said one of them had 'run after me', and all three offered me a free item for my trouble. This is the first time anyone has offered this (another reason I felt the new person was a manager). I appreciated the offer, but it's too little, too late. I just wanted to get out of that store before I said something I would regret.\nI will not be going back to this location even though it has the convenience of parking. I would rather hunt for parking on Fillmore and actually get what I ordered 97% to 100% of the time, than deal with employees who either don't want to be there, don't pay attention to/care what they're doing, or don't have proper supervision (for the employees with possible cognitive or literacy issues). My advice to the franchise owner/manager: don't focus on numbers of employees, focus on the quality of employees. At the very least, hire shift supervisors who are on the ball and can motivate people.\n\n*UPDATE* I was craving bagels, so I decided to give this location another chance.  There were two employees behind the counter and including me, three customers. I ORDERED a bagel with egg, cheese and chives. I GOT a bagel with egg, cheese and chive schmear. I don't know if it was the order taker or the maker who made the error (I didn't open the bagel in the store as I thought it would be correct, since the other two customers had left). Anyway, no time to go back so I had an inedible bagel. Currently hoping to see a homeless person while I'm driving.  I am paying twice for my lunch . Oh well, shame on me!", "author": "Heather M."}

The sandwich was available on any choice of bagel or bread, a feature I really liked. It also came with a choice from a variety of sides such as chips, potato salad, fruit salad, and slaw. I chose the fruit salad. There were a few too many pineapples for my personal taste, but it was still better than the other options so I didn't complain. Also, it comes with a pickle on the side which was a great bonus. The lox was great on one of the bagel thins. It made the sandwich a little smaller and less filling, but i didn't want too much bagel anyway.\n\n[THE VALUE] 4/4\nMy sandwich was about..$7.75? I know it started with a 7. Anyway, that is a lot cheaper than I'm used to seeing lox go for (sometimes i see them at $10-11) but they gave me plenty of salmon, plus my sides all for about $8.00 after tax, so i think that was a pretty great value.\n\n[THE SERVICE] 4/5\nGreat service.

The review I am going to write isn't necessary for this particular location, but to the company as a whole. I placed an online catering order for my 5 year old son's birthday party early April. It was scheduled to deliver at 10:00 am but it was not arrived until 11:10 am. It just happened it was a raining day and all my guests and kids were so hungry for breakfast. Finally the delivery guy arrived without knowing the exact location I was at, nor did he apologize. AND he did not even know he was very late. And because he delivered my bagels in a cab, he couldn't help me to carry my bagels and all other stuff to the playground. I had to carry everything myself. Ok, its fine coz as long as my guests could eat. Next day I called the company (1800 number) to complaint and asked for a partial refund and they said a manager would call me back. 3-4 days later no one called me back so I called again and told them refund might not be really necessary but I need an apology or something (maybe I am asking too much). 3-4 days later, still no one called me back. I called again, the person I talked to said my case was resolved and therefore, it was closed. BUT NO!!!!! No one had called me and said anything to me.

How hard is it to create 2 lines - one for people who wish to simply get a few bagels and leave - the other for people who want to peruse the menu and then order a sandwich or toasted bagel? Why so dysfunctional? Sometimes the line is moving so slowly that people leave and walk down the street to the market to buy bagels there. The shop could triple its business if the manager went to NY and took lessons on how to run a bagel shop. The bagels are marginal - pretty much people go here because there is no competition - if a good bagel shop opened in Laurel Village - Noah's would be gone in no time at all.

It's no longer large, juicy pieces of white meat chicken in a delicious sauce. It's now small, chunky bits of meat (white?dark?) in a mayonnaise-y sauce. I got the Asiago Bagel w/ Chicken Salad today, and there were (seriously) 3 tiny pieces of chicken slathered in mediocre mayonaise on each half, covered with a massive and wilty piece of lettuce.

OK, so I don't carry cash -- it's not my fault that this joint doesn't make you sign when you pay via credit card, and since this is the case, there is no space to leave a tip.  I honestly think the people working here have put my name on their blacklist.  OK -- so I have been going to this particular noah's bagel for about 1 whole year, 2-4 times a week!  so the people working here DEFINATELY know me, my name and my face.  AND they know that I never tip -- because like i said before -- i never carry cash, only plastic, and they don't give me the option to tip with plastic, so i figure it's not my choice or fault.  well -- after todays' experience, i am never going back there again -- i will try House of Bagels instead (they did indeed bake our wedding challah, and it was yummy).  so let me tell you what happened today.  well for the 3rd time they gave me veggie or lox schmear instead of sundried tomato scmear, which i specifically requested on my bagel.  the first time this happened, i was in the car already, and it was gross that they would put slamon lox schmear on an everything bagel veg-out (yuck!), too bad i was starving, pregnant, and in a hurry to get to my massage at mindful body, tat i just had to gobble it down.  the 2nd time this happened, they put veggie schmear on my everything bagel veg-out instead of sun-dried tomato, this time i specifically requested no onions, and i had to eat that too because again i was aleady in the car on my way to another massage, the poor masseuse had to smell my onion breathe the whole hour.  so, today, and the 3rd time this happened, i actually checked my bagel before i got into my car, and lo and behold, again it had the wrong schmear, i mean these pople should know me by now -- i order the same thing every time (2-4 times a week), i order a veg-out on an everything bagel with sun-dried tomato schmear -- you would think they would have figured it out by now.  that's not all -- when i brought my bagel back today -- they guy actually told me that he put veggie schmear instead of sun-dried tomato schmear.  AND after i ordered, i hear my name whispered 3 times to the different people behind the counter -- as though to say, yep this is the gal who's bagel we usually screw up on purpose because she doesn't ever tip us.  ALSO,  they have repeatedly forgotten my pickle, once i actually ate in the store, and brought it up, and they were very rude about giving it to me -- as if.....and if i recall correctly the bagel mishap happened not 3 but 4 times -- so i've had it -- i will not give them my $$$ anymore, they are crap anyway, the only reason why i went there was because it was close to my prenatal yoga at the JCCSF up the street.  i wish i remembered the crew people's names, so i could name them here -- but trust me when i tell you that numerous people have screwed up my bagel -- it's like they really did mark my name up.  so beware this place -- the bagels suck, the customer service sucks, and they hold a vendetta and a grudge just because you pay via credit card.  would not recommend.", "author": "Jordan F."}
