We would like to say a big THANK YOU to Jeannie for going above and beyond for our dining experience. And a, thanks for not giving a crap about us, to Jackie who was about to be off her shift and didn't care about us as her table. \nForgot our waters, forgot our appetizer, I asked for soup, couldn't substitute, asked for a salad, she forgot to put in a side salad. Basically just did the minimal since she knew she wasn't going to be getting the tip. \nLuckily her relief actually cared about us, (aka Jeannie) and we were taken care of for the rest of our visit. \nOn another note, food was fantastic and you get some amazing views of the bay and Alcatraz when you have a prime spot in the dining room. I highly recommend the fresh fish and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e sampler! \n5 stars for Jeannie, 1 star for Jackie!", "author": "Alison R."}

I thought I hit the jackpot since I walked right in and sat at the bar, but I should have taken that as a sign. \n\nThe view here is stunning and, in my opinion, the best on the Pier, but that's how they get you. I ordered a drink and a water from my sever, about 10 minutes later, I got a very watered down raspberry limoncello martini, no water. The drink had no taste and was a poor excuse for a martini. \n\nWhile I was there, the bar was about half full, but as soon as I got my drink, I never saw the bartender again until 20 minutes later. Don't get me wrong, he was busy, but on the other end of the bar. \n\nWhen I finally got the bartenders attention, he got my bill and left me to sign and tip with a dead pen. I tried to track him down, but just wanted to get out of there, so I searched my purse, signed the bill and left. \n\nI sat at the bar bored and reading their reviews and they were very comparable to my experience. When service isn't good, you don't want to invest any more money into a place. I honestly wanted food, but was scared I would be there until midnight.", "author": "Emily D."}

My group and I came to Pier 39 on 4th of July and after searching around for what seemed like forever for a restaurant to eat at, we ventured here and were pleased to be seated within half an hour even though they said the wait would be closer to an hour. \n\nI was feeling like seafood since I figured it would be the specialty so I went with the fresh Mahi which came with sides of potatoes & vegetables. The fish was so incredibly fresh and I liked the creaminess of the sauce. In addition to the Mahi Mahi, I knew I had to get the clam chowder since that's the 'touristy' thing to do while in San Francisco. I enjoyed the feeling of being able to munch on clams that seemed fresh out of the ocean. \n\nWe got very lucky and had the best seats in the house for fireworks. We basically ate and indulged for 3 hours until the fireworks came on and were able to enjoy the show indoors while people outside the restaurant on the pier appeared to be freezing to death! (Poor poor people).\n\nI would definitely recommend requesting to sit by the window. The sunset view really is breathtakingly romantic and I couldn't stop staring at it and taking deep sighs. \n\nI have high hopes for this place and believe it deserves a much higher average rating!", "author": "Monica C."}

It's the last place in the back of this boardwalk, upstairs, and secluded.  When you walk in you are immediately greeted. That is a big deal for me; Even when your busy you should try to greet your guests.  There was immediate seating at the bar and about a 10 minute wait for the tables (most likely you would have a window seat right by the water) on a Saturday afternoon around 6:30pm.  So we sat at the bar.  It took them a while to greet us there.  Understandable..no biggie it's the bar.  A waiter came by, greeted us, dropped off the napkins, after that we didn't see him for about 15 min.  They got our order and it wasn't delivered to the bar then to us which I like. The kitchen brought it straight to us. \n\nNow the portion sizes are small like we were in Europe or something. That's why I say you are paying for the ambiance for sure. The main fish was good and a good size but the potatoes that came with it ..like 6 pieces and they aren't the same size and the side asparagus...2 pieces.  I was kind of upset at that because I live asparagus.  I got a side of creamer spinach and that was the \"best thang runnin\".  Out of all our food choices (the fried fish platter ..lobster Mac and clam chowder and my ahi blackened the creamed spinach was the bomb lol.  \n\nOverall I had a good experience.  They love breaking glasses there.  The manager and the bartender / barback broke a glass within the 1.5 hours we were there.  The check for just my food and bae's was $111.00 (blackened ahi and fried platter).   The Mac and clam chowder bowl was about $50. \n\nThe other places around the pier was poppin' and to get more for your money I would definitely go somewhere else.  It if you want the atmosphere then go here.", "author": "Toni S."}

Catch House is a better choice. With the Amazing view and a romantic place for a quiet dinner date this just made our day. We started with the Bruschetta for our appetizer. Everything was delicious. The spreads were so flavorful, the jam, cheese, mushrooms, artichokes, hummus, crab and bell peppers. Its a great starter. We shared the Orange Scented Fall Salad. Such a refreshing salad with beets, squash, pecans and a lot of good stuffs in there. Not overly dressed. I wanted to get the seafood cioppino but  im too lazy to eat and crack the crab so i decided to get the seafood pasta. The scallops and fish were great as well as the sauce but i was hoping for a larger shrimp. The shrimp were pretty tough but it still taste good. My boyfriend got the seafood platter with coconut shrimp, fish and calamari. What can go wrong with deep fried seafood and 3 dipping sauces. It had the Perfect crunch that we wanted for a fried food lolz. Servings are generous and both of us were satisfied with what we had. We enjoyed watching the Pelicans, Seagulls, Sea Lions and a lot of charter boats plus the view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Alcatraz. Service were good too. We were lucky to be seated in a spot were we can see the nice view of the water. It was a wonderful sunset dinner. Bathrooms were clean too. That is a plus. We are planning to come back and try other food on their menu. Reservations are recommened but walk-ins are welcome.

The service is absolutely horrible, there's large posts blocking your view (depending on where you sit) and the staff is very unapologetic for a n y t h i n g. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came for a great meal. The layout of the building and interior is exquisite, and the view looks awesome while you are waiting to be seated. Our wait time was forty five minutes and we requested to be texted when our table was ready. We ended up staying in the building the whole time waiting for our seats. My phone lit up with a text letting us know our table was ready but when we walked up to the host she informed us it would be ready in \"2 seconds\" but it took nearly ten minutes. I went to the bathroom and my boyfriend had ended up getting seated, he asked the waiter if he could go tell me where we were seated. The waiter then stated that he had to stay put because they had other people to seat. Implying our table would not be made available to us if we were not present. Which is crap because we had waited over an hour for our seats in the first place. I made my way to the table and we finally were ready to place our order. Our server took more than five minutes to greet us for drinks. He finally arrived and while he was talking to us, he for some reason took our silverware and napkins (??) which was odd but I figured he just wasn't paying attention. Bread was brought out to us but it was cold and the included crackers were stale. There was also a hair in our butter. When reported to the waiter he looked more annoyed versus apologetic and never brought out an additional butter even though he said he would. The food looked AWESOME, but wasn't that great. Especially for how expensive it was. The crab melt was pretty good and came out hot. The fries on the other hand were definitely not their specialty, which is safe to assume considering they're mainly seafood based (being by the ocean and all). The coconut shrimp was kind of dry, but decent, but the fried fish tasted kind of weird. The calamari was great and the \"famous lava cake\" was aight. I was expecting some amazing dessert since it was so called ~famous~ but it was actually dry and literally burnt. I've had better desserts at the Cheesecake Factory for better prices. \n\nAll in all, the place wasn't to great and not really worth as much as they charge. I would consider it more of a one time thing since the view is beautiful depending on your angle, and some of the food items can be quite tasty. The service, however, is a completely different story.

In fact all of our food was mediocre at best. \n\nThe crab was like tiny bits of shredded leftovers and the veggies were chopped into small morsels.

We ran out of bread about halfway through, and asked for more bread and also what this one mystery dip on our plate was. The bartender disappeared for 20 minutes and never came back. We just wanted to get out of there at this point so I put cash on the table and left. (Way too much because I didn't have change so they still got a good tip after all of their effort to ruin our afternoon).\n\nLook, I get that some things on the menu are more of a pain in the ass to prepare than others, and that you can make comments to that effect, but if you comment and then basically promise (and absolutely deliver) bad service because of that?

A member of our party suggested eating at the bar. We sat in the eating area and the bar tender took our orders and served us from there.  We would have done this initially, had the option been given by either one of the two hostesses. It saved our party a great deal of time and was a simple solution to a group of people traveling  in from the East Coast, that very same day, on business.\n\nI ordered the crab melt on rye. It was served cold, though it should have been warm. That greatly impacted my overall experience, though I do imagine that straight from the kitchen, it would have been phenomenal.

It was sunset and absolutely stunning. We started off with free bread and butter, as with most fancy restaurants. Our mains were the Prime Rib French Dip with Monterey Jack, caramelized onions & au jus ($19) and the Dungeness Crab Melt with tomatoes, Jack & cheddar cheese served atop toasted Boudin sourdough ($19.5). The prime rib was very juicy and the au jus a great addition. The crab was surprisingly an open-face sandwich, with so much cheese that it was almost overpowering the crab flavor. They were both good, but definitely not worth their prices. However, I get the \"ambience\" tax that we were paying and understand why they were so high.\n\nThis was a unique experience, mostly thanks to the view and unparalleled service.

After an adventurous morning with my sister and a fun tour of the aquarium we were on the hunt for a mini meal to tide us over till our evening dinner reservations. \n\nI picked Chart House for it's happy hour menu. From 4-6pm they have $6-$9 small plates and a $6-$8 drink menu. The place was pretty empty so we had our choice of bar seating. We could've sat in the more scenic part by the windows and scene of the bay, sitting by the entrance offered a bit of peace and quiet. My sister was debating her cocktail choices while I was more interested in the food, deciding on two small plates instead of one. I got a glass of chardonnay ($6) and she got the raspberry lemon drop ($8). For food she got the fish and chips on happy hour ($7) and I got the Coconut Shrimp ($7) and the Oyster Rockefeller ($9) both on happy hour as well.\n\nEverything came beautifully presented. The portions were perfect for a mini meal. I tried a bite of her fish and it was so good I almost placed an order for a second one (dinner reservations prevented me....next time I'll get my own!) The oysters were served on a bed of blue rock salt, very pretty (what do they do with the garnish after though? I wonder...) and my sister loved the homemade tarter sauce. The coconut shrimp she actually loved despite her dislike of coconut- it wasn't a sweet coconut she declared, it was definitely more \"nutty\" and not oily at all. My wine was good but now I wish I had gotten a cocktail like she did, especially during happy hour. \n\nLooking over their dinner menu they have a $30 chef's tasting which is always fun to try, I would love to go back for that. The rest of the items seemed pretty standard in this fancy, right on the river restaurant in the most touristy part of town. You should expect that when you walk in BUT if you are looking for an affordable bite with great ambiance and AMAZING customer service you have to come during happy hour and sample a few small plates here. Matt, our bartender was so on point- friendly, helpful, amazing customer service and a great drink. Kudos to Matt!\n\nThanks again, we will be back soon.", "author": "Evangelina R."}

Staff went the extra mile to make our dinner truly special and memorable.  I'm happy there's finally a Chart House in SF, and it makes sense they took over Neptune's...about time!  Ironically, we found out the news about Chart House SF from the Lake Tahoe location when we were there October 2015, good times!\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chart-house-san-francisco?select=1W9xlmmmo966kB2Od6q-ew\n\nMany moons ago, I was told there was a Chart House in Sausalito...imagine the views.  Well, the one in SF is just as amazing, along with stunning views of Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge, boats and cruise ships sailing by.  It sure makes for a romantic night out, and the icing on the cake was seeing the Hornblower SF Belle sail by our window.  Many unforgettable memories on the SF Belle, as we renewed our vows on that spectacular yacht.  \n\nOnto the food, we started out with the shellfish skillet (highly recommended).  I brought a bottle of wine for the special occasion ($25 corkage).  Although, they have an extensive wine list and pretty reasonable by the bottle.  Hubby ordered swordfish for the first time, and it was superb!  He enjoyed his entree; our server Gerardo mentioned it was an excellent choice.  I ordered the seafood pasta, and it was full of creamy flavor, not cheesy or salty, absolutely delicious.  When the Manager of the Day Amanda came by our table, I had cleaned my plate.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chart-house-san-francisco?select=HqyTA3O8CyOtLUrUvAIu4Q\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chart-house-san-francisco?select=BLhF5UvJmdEEzc7-3bqjFQ\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chart-house-san-francisco?select=dL5dGEIxM-17Li-AHsBKHg\n\nOf course no anniversary celebration is complete without a decadent dessert.  We ordered their signature hot chocolate lava cake with molten center, made with Godiva liqueur, topped with chocolate sauce, heath bar crunch, and vanilla ice cream - must have!  It takes at least 25 minutes to make per our server, and what made it even more special was Amanda taking it off our bill...did you think I was going to say the candle HA!  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chart-house-san-francisco?select=tG6PayvjXsf_udkqP8CsVw\n\nThank you for making our anniversary unforgettable!  Can't wait to come back, even just for happy hour and the views alone.  'Til we meet again ~ cheers! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chart-house-san-francisco?select=T9j67ueo6VERQcw7WI-Faw \n\nP.S.  I couldn't get Eric Clapton's song outta my head...oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight.  Hubby calls me his darling every night (makes me feel all giddy).

We were looking for a nice place close to the water to have a reception dinner with our family. Since our wedding was simple I wanted dinner to be special. We had a small party of 14 and were to small for most places that also charged a huge minimum.\n \nI was so happy to find Chart House and Stanley R. Howard, Catering Sales Manager. He helped me design a set menu for the adults and kids. He was even able to print them with our names and date. We were set up with an elegant table in a semi-private room, that felt so private. We had a beautiful view of the bay, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. We were also close to the sea lions which was perfect for the kids.\n\nThe food was amazing. We had Clam chowder, salad, salmon, filet mignon and chicken picatta. The kids had burgers, fish & chips and chicken strips. The deserts were decadently delicious and the drinks were great. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. Everyone went above and beyond to make everything perfect.

You & I both know, this was not because they were busy but because they wanted to up the bill total with some cocktails. Fine, I like a good cocktail and would have ordered one anyway. \n\nThe waiter was painfully slow. Took forever to take our order and then an eternity to get the food. I actually aged while waiting. When the food finally came, my salad was missing dressing so the waiter had to go back and get it. I honestly think he had to go to the 1000 islands to get the dressing (see what I did there? 1000 island dressing-haha-I kill me)\n\nOnce we were done eating we had to wait a long time for the check.

My group of 11 stumbled upon this place after sailing the bay - being a large group, we opted to just stay around the bar area and have drinks. We also ordered a bunch of appetizers since it was Happy Hour... they have a good selection of discounted food from 4-6 on weekdays. I'm not sure about coming here otherwise... it's pretty expensive and it's not like the food is amazing.\n\n- Mediterranean Hummus Tasting ($6): Colorful, but the hummus wasn't anything special. Best part was the plantain chips they give... these are good on their own. Really wish they'd provide more bread for the amount of hummus that comes with a plate!\n\n- Prime Rib Sliders ($9): These were BOMB. Seriously, the prime rib is really tasty and goes great with the onions. Each order comes with 3 and we ended up getting more of them. Comes with the same sauce you get with french dip.\n\n- Kim Chee Calamari ($8): Not sure how I feel about these... they're perfectly fried and the calamari is delicious... but in the 2 orders we go, we got more fried vegetables than we did calamari. Felt kinda ripped off. The fries vegetables were pretty tasty, especially with the sauce.\n\n- Salt and Pepper Chicken ($7): Pass. The chicken was really dry and bland... dipped in the sauce it was OK. Fair warning, the sauce is pretty spicy.\n\n- Ahi Nachos ($8): These were OK... the wasabi drizzle overloads your sense of the taste. I think the calamari is a better deal if we want to talk about portions too. Honestly the ahi tuna you can get at a poke place for a better deal and quality.\n\n- Spinach Artichoke Dip ($6): Good with a beer! I really wish they'd give you more crostini, since there isn't enough for the amount of artichoke dip there is. Like the hummus, they're so stingy on carbs here haha.\n\n- Coconut Crunchy Shrimp ($7): Pass... these are alright, but so small for the portion and price. \n\nService is pretty hilarious here... at least at the bar. While we were waiting forever to get drink orders (it wasn't even that busy), they lost a couple's order of appetizers and they also misplaced a guy's credit card. Ouch. They also forgot our ahi nachos during the first round of food, but luckily they recovered on the second round.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "The Chart House - not this branch - holds a fond place in my heart, hearkening back to its 1970's era heyday as a classy date night place.  They were on the water (Chart House is always on the water), sported a menu painted onto a wooden plank, and had a salad bar for which there was little match.  It'd been years since I'd stepped foot inside a Chart House and was surprised to see this one sitting out there at the far end of Pier 39.\n\nThough most things do change over the course of 40 years it took a bit of sleuthing to discover what I believe is the biggest reason for changes to the Chart House:  In 2002 the franchise was bought up by Landry's, an organization which owns and operates more than 500 restaurants, hotels, and casinos including Joe's Crab Shack, Rainforest Cafe, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Claim Jumper, and a whole lot more.  \n\nJust reading that list saddens me as I associate it with a sort of institutionalized mediocrity.  \n\nAmid the hubbub of Pier 39 I think it'd be difficult to maintain a restaurant which I'd today describe as classy and I don't think Chart House is trying too hard to do so.  The place looked anything but special, and just like every other place on that list above.  \n\nMany people coming for a drink and a snack, as I was, will probably head to the tables immediately on view upon entry but the smart money is to wade inside a bit.  There are water view tables in the bar area from which the ambiance is improved.  \n\nDrinks (2 Irish Coffees, 2 Keoki Coffees) ran around $10 apiece and were unremarkable as was a steamed Artichoke appetizer.  A Mediterranean platter was an odd mix which included plantain chips and something hummus-like which was trying to masquerade as guacamole.  None of it was bad, but that's not to say it was good.  The whole experience (aside from good service) was just terribly mediocre.  \n\nLike that long ago love you run into many years later, Chart House hasn't weathered well at all under Landry's watch.  It's gone from something special to nothing special.  If you want a drink and a water view and insist it be at Pier 39 this is probably about the best you can do but if you're willing and able to move off this pier and head southeast, you can do far better.", "author": "Tracey A."}

After waking around a bit we just ended up here. It was 3pm on a Thursday, but not too busy. We initially asked for a table along the window to get a great view and the hostess let us know that they are mainly reservation only. Ok nbd since you could see the view from most of the tables. \n\nI wish I knew the hostess's name because she was awesome! She got us a table along the window in the corner with a fantastic view of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered clam chowder and lobster mac n cheese and I got the seafood platter bc I couldn't decide what I wanted. The calamari was delicious, light and fresh like it should be. The coconut shrimp flavor was ok, pretty coconutty, yet slightly deceiving bc it looks like you're getting 6 pieces, but in actuality it was only a couple pieces split in half to the tail so it looks like it's 2, but it's not haha. Now the fish...I known their fried fish was going to taste the way it did, I wouldn't have ordered it. I got through half of the first piece before I took off all the breading of the other half and the second piece.  I couldn't even tell which was the gross part, the breading or the fish itself. I made myself eat the fish with tartar sauce on it bc I just couldn't let it go to waste when it was $29...\n\nThe three stars is for my fianc\u00e9 enjoying all of his food, the awesome view and great service. If you want fish and chips though, you might be better off at any one of the million other venders and you'd have leftover cash for some Ghirdelli", "author": "Jealee A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-04", "description": "I decided to wait two weeks before writing this review, because I was not happy and did not want my rage to affect the fairness of a review. I also read most of the reviews on Yelp, to make sure my case wasn't just a fluke. Conclusion: this place needs to change, fast.\n\nHere we are, visiting from Miami, on a road trip from Phoenix to SFO, and my daughter wants a to have lunch at a nice restaurant on the water. Chart House looked ideal, although prices are high, but if food is good and service is top notch then pricing is a non issue. \n\nWe arrived early, at about noon, place was 80% empty, so we ask for a table by the window. Hostess, which never smiled once and demonstrated that customers are not really that important, said that unfortunately there were no window tables available, but we would get one that had a good view too. We got a table in the second row, the view was good if the window table had no one sitting there, which was not the case, but whatever. To my surprise I looked around and saw a couple of empty tables by the window, I wondered if they didn't have enough staff to serve that area, because why would she deny us the table we requested if there are available? Lo and behold, 15 minutes later they take a couple to the empty window table. Really? I was not happy. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes our waiter (finally)  arrives. He's ok, all business, seemed to be in a hurry, although place still was half empty. Didn't care to discuss items on the menu.\n\nAnyway, since we are in CA, we both decided to order the Dungeness Melt ($20 each) and the Cup of Clam Chowder ($5).\n\nDrinks took forever to arrive, so did the food. I was thinking \"please don't bring me cold food, please don't ruin it\".\n\nCrash and burn, the Melt was melted for sure, but 20 minutes ago, now it was solid, and lukewarm. Plate was cold. And the Clam Chowder (appetizer) came almost at the same time as main dishes. To make things worse the Melts and Chowder were just OK, nothing worth the price they charge.\n\nThen we want to get our check. Waiter missing in action. Took like 20 minutes to get the check and pay.\n\nHere's just an aside to the attitude of the waiter: the check had a 5% \"surcharge\", when I asked what this surcharge is he responded in great disdain \"it's to help us with our health insurance deductibles\"... really? They can't afford the ACA (oxymoron  intended) and we have to pay for it? This elevated my anger even more, since his service was sub-par, and now I have to help him pay his insurance.\n\nIn summary, a $75 lunch bill for two average-tasting sandwiches, one mini clam chowder and one beer (Bud Light at $7.50!!), and unremarkable service, grumpy hostess, and taxes and surcharges.\n\nSorry, I can't recommend this place, not even for tourists.", "author": "Alexandre H."}

Our waiter was on top of things. there were 11 of us at this event.  Focused on Good times, Food, and Business.  \n\nWe arrived just before sundown, and of course we were able to see the bay, which is an amazing site from this establishment on the pier.  The food was wonderful, what made out first night there memorable was the staff.  Our waiter was on top of it.  Very attentive, paid attention to multiple tables, but you could not tell, he was that good. The food was wonderful, no one was thirsty, and our table was always kept clean.  This was a 5 star experience... \n\nThe second night this time with only 9 of us, and a less crowded evening that the first, our waiter was lacking.  While the food was good, our table was cluttered, our water glasses were empty, and when we ordered refills on drinks through out the meal, we waited a long time.  For example, we asked for coffee, or night caps to close the meal, but received them after the bill came... awkward ..  we had to remind our waiter that we ordered the drinks.  But we felt, the second night we were taken for granted.  This was a 2 star night.  Our guests even felt the lack of attention... \n\noverall, the experiences were inconsistent. I can see why some give this place 5 stars and other only give it 1.  I hope they eventually find their grove.  This place has awesome views, the food was good, but what makes or breaks an establishment is the service.", "author": "Balinor I."}

With no glasses. 25mins to get what is supposed to be calamari but was just a bunch of fried onions, green beans and peppers. 30mins later our food came. My fish tacos had two tiny Mini fish McNuggets in them. My wife's seafood dish was cold where most of the muscles were DOA and unopened.. so just a decoration I guess. My daughters crab sandwich was completely cold as it must have been sitting around for our other food. \n\nStay away from this place. The view is the bait, but don't let yourself get sucked in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-01", "description": "The view here is absolutely breathtaking as you can see the entire bay, as well as see the historic Alcatraz right in front of your eyes. The view itself is well worth the cost. \n\nAs for the food, the Kim chee calamari is what all battered calamari aspire to be. The batter was coated wonderfully onto the jumbo sized calamari rings and legs which was generously lathered with sweet and sour sauce. Every bite that I took was a bite that I wanted to take back, because I knew which each bite, there would be less calamari to consume. Basically what I'm saying is, get the calamari its 5 star. \n\nOther than the calamari, we got a crab cake melt ($19) which had chunks of fresh SF bay dungeness in it, so it was very pleasing, and was topped off with basic fries 8/10\n\nWe also got the sea bass ($35), which was a very forgettable dish so it was average at best. \n\nAlthough the food was delightful, the service on the other hand is a work in progress. For an establishment as beautiful as this one they should have a staff in which compliments the restaurant as a whole. Unfortunately our waitress came to our table twice out of the hour that we were there, once to take our order and twice to give us the check.

While the view is indeed amazing, the food was at best average in my wife's opinion & sub-par in my opinion.  The service was exceptionally slow & I would not recommend as a lunch option.   My wife had the bread bowl of clam chowder and felt it was nothing special.  I did note the bowl did not even appear to be full.   My wife did give the sourdough bread high marks.   I had the chicken BLT with fries.  I did not even finish half of the sandwich and at 300lbs that's pretty rare .  I felt the grilled chicken had a fish taste to it and the fries were cold and tasted as if they had been sitting around for some time.   My daughter had a burger and fries and indicated the burger was tasty though sloppy (get plenty of napkins) and she also found the fries cold & unappealing.   \n\nService was polite but reporting as slow and aloof is being kind.  There was no real inquiry into how we felt about our meal and obviously watching us not eat and to refuse carry out boxes for such large portions should have prompted some question into our satisfaction.  Of course I could have asked to speak to management; but, honestly I was frustrated, hungry & running out of patience with my time there.", "author": "Donald A."}

Honestly after reading all the reviews I was really hesitate and was about to leave the restaurant since I was at the bar area. All the 1&2 stars definitely scared me off but my boyfriend convinced me to give this place a chance. Let's just say I was not in a good mood cause I was complaining that this is gonna suck , etc. \n\nStarted off with drinks - I forgot what I ordered but it has peach schnapps in it and melon too. My first sip I was in heaven . It was soooooooo good. You can taste the alcohol but at the same time I would drink this everyday . My bf got wine and he said it was good too. So that was a positive note. \n\nFor appetizers, we got the shellfish iron skillet. Definitely worth it. Came with some crab, shrimp, and mussel . Whatever sauce they had on it was amazing. Very flavorful and my bf who HATES shrimp , (like will not eat anything with shrimp) gave it a try and loved it . That's saying something haha. \n\nFor our entree my bf got the chart House Cut while I got the prime rib melt. His was medium rare and they made it perfect. I'm not really the type to eat meat rare just because I have a sensitive stomach but I did give it a try. It was so juicy and tender I actually loved it . As for my prime rib melt that was amazing too. Everything from the caramel iced onion to the sourdough bread at the bottom-- it was on point. I was full but couldn't stop stuffing myself. And the mash potatoes !!! \n\nUnfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but I have a new favorite restaurant at Pier 39 now !!

The prime rib tasted like a smooth herb butter infused tender steak, one of the best I have ever tasted. I tried a small bit of the seafood pasta, it was also extremely flavorful and smooth. \n\nThe service was the only reason why I deducted 2 stars. I saw our waiter attend to tables right next to us while he simply ignored us. He failed to fill up our waters on multiple occasions without us asking. The only thing he was quick about was giving us our checks. I had to walk up to a server to get a steak knife since they failed to give me one and our waiter never checked up on us. Not sure why the service was bad, but we are just a couple of 18 year olds eating at a fancy restaurant, maybe they just think we didn't belong there, which is also a bad image. \n\nValue: I would rather pay for my meal and just take it to go, the price is worth it simply for the food!", "author": "Christian M."}

Amazing hummus plate. \n\nThe cons: the service, cold food that took an hour to come out, terrible bloody Mary's, dirty glassware. \n\nI wasn't expecting a life changing culinary experience at this place, but because they are affiliated with Landry's, I would have thought they would have standards to follow. We had to send back a Bloody Mary that came out way too salty, as well as cold French fries that took an hour to come out. The restaurant manager clearly avoided our table, as he was stopping at each one to encourage guests to sign up for their loyalty program. \n\nThe presentation and taste of the hummus plate was a bright spot. It featured three different kinds - pepper, kalamata olive, and avocado. We enjoyed it tremendously and I will keep the image of how it was presented in my mind for the next time I'm making a platter like that.", "author": "Christine C."}

They did warn us about the sun before seating us, but we didn't really feel like we could refuse it, because the only other option was an indeterminate wait time. The view from this corner table was fantastic, but I ended up in the worst glare seat and spent the entire dinner in a blaze of hot sun. My water glass went down quick and because the service was so slow, I was thirsty for most of the dinner.\n\nMy party ordered a shared seafood platter appetizer which was really delicious. It came quickly, the seafood was well cooked, and the marinade/sauce is spicy and sweet and super sticky. The dish comes with crab crackers and bibs but no extra napkins. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and by the end had seafood shells and sticky greasy sauce all over the place. I really think this dish warranted wet naps or hot towels. Unfortunately, this was when the service really started to lag, and I was just miserable to be trapped in a hot corner, my napkin saturated in sticky fish, my beverage empty, and the table a mess. \n\nWe waited a long time for our entrees, but when they came they were really good. The portions are big and we all enjoyed what we'd ordered. But my second cocktail was served without the garnish (peaches, they ran out), which definitely downgraded it. You can't make a peach cocktail without peaches.  I wasn't offered a chance to change my order, and I was pretty thirsty and desperate by that time, so I drank it anyway but I feel like it should have been discounted or a replacement offered or something. \n\nAfter our second course they were able to bus everybody's place at my table expect mine, so I sat in hot mess for the long time it took to finish and pay. I will say, during this whole period I noticed multiple instances of kitchen or host staff running food, staff seeming to help each other out across roles, so it did seem like problem with the service was not the individual efforts of the staff- who overall seemed to be effective- but rather a large scale organizational failure in the restaurant. It was pretty miserable, which hurt when the bill came. \n\nThe food we had was great, but the service would have been objectionable at a restaurant half the price.", "author": "Emily M."}

So, we decided look no more and just wait for seating.  It was around after 215pm, 20 min wait which not too bad wait.  We were so amazed the host sit us at the corner with the view! It was really awesome and we appreciated.  My friend ordered lunch special calm chowder with salmon and rice $20.  She said the chowder was lukewarm and salmon was not bad but very small portion.   As for me, I ordered crab louie salad $20, a bowel calm chowder $7.  Yes I agreed the soup lukewarm, but no taste at all, have to put lots of salt.  The salad was too much dressing and very little crab but maybe for $20 is cheap price? We got what we pay for ? It was pretty looking plate, glad I took one pic of the meal.  See attached.   We were really wish to stay longer drinking out hot tea, but the host and waiter giving us sigal \"is there anything you need?\" We know there is long line and we have to go.

Didn't have to fight for window seating because there was hardly anybody at the restaurant. Granted it was a Monday around 5pm but I figured this place would be busy for happy hour? Nope. I came here with my boyfriend and we sat at the high tables for happy hour. Our server was pleasant and accommodating, didn't have any problems there. I've read that customer service is a hit or miss, mainly miss but we didn't have any problems on this occasion. \n\nThe menu seems to be more on the Asian side with a lot of kimchi flavors and tons of seafood options, which there should be. The drink menu was your standard with martinis and mojitos and wines. I went with the mango mojito which was a bit sweet but not strong at all. A bit disappointing paying $9 for basically juice. \n\nAppetizers were okay. We opted for the shrimp, calamari, and mussels. The portions were on the smaller side and the overall flavor was just okay. Nothing really stood out to me. I would hate to pay full price for any of the items I had that day, that's why I would only say come by for happy hour. \n\nThe low ratings are fair for Chart House.

We are Landry's club members and have never had a problem with any of their other restaurants thus far however this was not an experience we'll share again. \n\nWe ordered the fish tacos and the appetizer seafood platter. They were way overpriced. The fish tacos had absolutely no flavor. They treated like boiled fish and dry cabbage ( I guess you could call that a flavor just not a good one). The saving grace was there appetizer seafood platter. It had so much spice and flavor that we could put the fish with it and it helped. \n\nThe greeting that you got when you walked in the front door needs to be addressed. Because my husband happened to be in a t-shirt that day they looked him up and down. Good thing for our waiter, he was friendly but unfortunately didn't come around so often. The flatware was dirty.

The table was reserved via a hotel concierge so that apparently got us \"VIP status\". First off, the view is absolutely amazing; you can't beat having dinner right in front of the SF sunset WITHOUT having to suffer the bone chilling winds. For appetizers, we got the crab avocado mango stack and the kimchi calamari. The calamari was pretty good, and the portion was very generous. The flavour was very Asian and I didn't get any hint of kimchi. The crab stack was mediocre at best; as the pungent bite from the raw onions way overshadowed the taste of everything else.\n\nFor entree I got the bronzed swordfish fish, as recommended by the server, at a steep price of $39! \"This better be good\", I thought. The dish came served by the chef on a moderately hot plate. He didn't talk about the dish at all apart from saying \"be careful of the hot plate\", so wasn't sure what the purpose of him coming out was. The fish had good texture, but was incredibly bland. The lump crab on top tasted ok, but was rather watery. As for the sides of potatoes and asparagus, I've definitely had better ones. \n\nThanks to our VIP status, we did get a complimentary lava cake, which turned out to be the highlight of the night. The server said it's made from scratch so it took awhile for it to come out. When it did, however, the cake was completely crumbled into bits because the ice cream was too heavy to be placed on top of it; the \"lava\" was still very hot nonetheless. \n\nAll in all, the food were rather disappointing and could use a lot of improvements. Service was all right, but the view made everything A-OK.", "author": "Ivy W."}

After she put the order in she brought us our check and said this is what will be on your check we can add to it if you want more.

Great flavor lots of crab and avocado really good.  A couple of them got the trio of soups and they said it was really good as well.\n\nSo now it comes time to pay the check.  All but one of us paid with card no big deal right!  Well the waitress says to her why don't you just pay with a card like the rest in a nasty tone.  Karen say because I don't want to.  So she takes our payment.  She brings back all of the card payments and not the change of the girl who paid cash. Karen asked for her change and she says I am working on it.  So before she walks off one of the other girls asked if she could have a 20 dollar bill broken for change.

They were more than happy to move us to a booth close by with the same view. The view by he way was gorgeous!

Seals, pelicans, boats, swimmers etc. \n\nOur waitress greeted us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and handed us a card. She made us aware that she was training her companion Rory in advance. Her customer service really made our night. She was so accommodating, patient and spoke eloquently. I honestly felt like royalty!

I added that it was our 28th in the notes and they went out of the way to make it special for us! Everyone called us by name, wished us Happy Anniversary, and our menus even had our name and Happy Anniversary printed on them!\nWe waited for a few moments at the bar for our table. I ordered a pretty layered margarita that I think was called the Vineyard. It was very good! Within about 5 minutes, the host walked over and invited us by name to follow him to the table.\nAt our table, we had the best service I think I have ever had. Alexa was our server and extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu with wonderful suggestions. I followed her recommendation for the Mahi, blackened with the Baja topping - sauteed shrimp, avocado, and corn salsa. Hubby has the Dungeness Crab which has very tasty, but he had forgotten how much work crab is. I'm supposed to remind him that he doesn't want to work that hard again, but that's not anything on the Chart House. They had it prepped wonderfully.\nFor dessert, they brought us the mud pie all decorated for us with candles.\nBeyond the service and the food, the location of this Chart House is perfect. It is at the end of Pier 39 with sweeping views of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. We had a perfect window table for sunset. \nThe manager stopped by and all the staff were very attentive.\nIt was an amazing night. Thank you!", "author": "Laurie A."}

My quest was solved at Chart House!  Looking at some of the past scores, it must have been an isolated incident for each guest. \n\nThe waiter did need to be flagged down and the bartender took his time, but the drinks had a lot of flavor and were decently strong. The chowder was good and the bread bowl was just what I was looking for.  My daughter is very picky and she didn't see anything she wanted so she followed my lead and said this was the best non-Asian food she's ever had!\n\nMy wife got the French dip and she couldn't put the sandwich down. Another guest at our table had the same sandwich and loved it. Another guest tried the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and loved it. \n\nThe prices were not too bad considering your view is of the bay, Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Can't get a better spot on the wharf!", "author": "Jon-paul N."}

The host staff, who were totally overwhelmed, told us to return after midnight! This was supposed to be an anniversary dinner, but that clearly was off the agenda if the Chart House wasn't going to be seating us until (literally) the next day. Given the lateness of the hour and paucity of other eating options at that time, we reluctantly acquiesced.\n\nWhen we returned *at the stated time*, they attempted to claim that they were now closed... an amazingly shoddy business practice. The manager, who might be expected to be at the forefront of all crises, seemingly had no idea that this fiasco was taking place, nor that the restaurant had been turning away reserved guests for hours! We insisted (only because every other establishment nearby was closed for the evening) and were eventually seated, nearly three hours late.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this establishment suffers from a complete lack of effective leadership, with a clueless GM who leaves the staff to swing in the breeze when times get tough. If I were the Chart House (or perhaps parent company Landry), I would seriously wonder what exactly I was paying this manager to do, because a quick scan of Yelp is all it takes to realize the depths of their incompetence. It's worth mentioning that we did not once hear an apology to ourselves or any other similarly affected customers!\n\nAfter all the tribulation, the food itself was tasty and our server (who had clearly been bearing the brunt of pissed off customers all night) was wonderful despite his obvious fatigue. My suggestion: take a page from the local football team's book and replace the manager, stat.

You will be sorely disappointed.   It was unbelievable to my husband and I how the two places could share the same name.  Monterey has world class food and salad bar.  Everything about it is high end.  Pier 39 should be show stopper based on location and view.  But that's where the comparison ends.  Waitress very kind and service was fine so I need to add that before I get to the bad part.  It's the food.  It is mediocre.  My husband ordered prime rib.  No seasoning and bland.  It came with a yukon gold mashed potatoes.  He says they were probably more seasoned than anything else he ate.  But $38 and not a sprig of a garnish or vegetable with it?  I had the seafood platter.  $29.   Fried calamari, fish, coconut shrimp and \"skinny\" fries.   How can anyone screw up fries you might ask ...well....they were lukewarm, no seasoning and lifeless.   Coconut shrimp was best item on the plate.  Calamari, not good, lukewarm.  Fish, looked like Vandekamps fish fillets.  Just huge and unattractive on the plate.   Here is the best part - came with three sauces.    Ok, you might say, here's the good stuff.   NOT.  None of the sauces were made from scratch.  WHAT??  I'm at the Chart House and they cannot make their own tarter sauce?  One of the sauces was not cocktail sauce which I found interesting with the food served.  I have never been so disappointed in seeing $150 fly out the door and for what?  I could have had shrimp cocktail from the street vendor and not felt so ripped off.

After a way too slow stop and go drive down we luckily made it in at around 430.  After rushing through the the Expo it was definitely time for cocktails!!! On the drive down my friend told me about a key lime martini recipe she got from a bartender in Las Vegas. The hunt was on! After striking out at the first two bars (no vanilla vodka) we ran into this place. When we walked in and saw the oh so mightily stocked bar we knew we hit the right place. We sat right down at the bar and after a few minutes of being taken by awe of the incredible view of the Pacific we turned back to see the ever smiling face of our bartender. We asked if he could make us the key lime martini and he so graciously let us give him the recipe to try. I must say, he rocked it! After sipping our tasty drinks for a few minutes we decided to order some nibbles. We ended up ordering the Shrimp, Crab, Avocado & Mango Stack (Dungeness crab & bay shrimp tossed in remoulade, layered with avocado & mango).  I must say, the presentation was impressive but the flavor and freshness was right on! The nice size portion of crab meat blended effortlessly with the fresh avocado and mango. About half way through we ordered another key lime martini and relaxed into easy conversation with the guy next to us who said he comes here just for their clam chowder.

Saw lots of ferries, boats, water taxis during our entire dinner gliding across the bay.  BFF's hubby wanted to dine at a restaurant where there was a view and to have the \"mud pie\" for dessert.  \n\nWe tried the following:\n1. Coconut shrimp appetizer, 6 prawns fried with a nice coconut flavor over a bed of fried rice noodles (vermicelli) in a fried, shell-shaped rice bowl which we broke apart and ate like chips.\n2. Kim Chee Calamari - a huge plate easily shared by 4 or more. Not really any kim chee flavor, just fried calamari and vegts with a spicy kick to it. Came with 3 dipping sauces - all sweet.\n3. Prime rib 10 oz.  - 3 of us had this, the meat was tender and seasoned, cooked med-rare as ordered.  Just delicious.  Didn't like Hubby's mashed potatoes which came with his meat as it had a funny taste/flavor, as if someone use stale milk/buttermilk to mix in it.  \nThe 3 of them added 'crab' topping on the side, a glob of shredded crab all drippy and wet was on the plated. I opted not to try that, but helped myself to several bites of Hubby's prime rib.  Not one to order prime rib/steaks, etc. at restaurants, I would definitely order this one if I were to return. \n4. Nut crusted mahi-mahi - was OK, sort of bland except for the sweet mango salsa on top of it which I didn't like.  The pyramid of rice and green beans were OK.\n\nMy dining companions had cocktails, I liked Hubby's Fleur dy Lis because of the coconut flavor.  I had a glass of merlot from Napa Valley, $10, which was very good.\n\nDessert:\n1. Creme Brulee - it was OK, have had better\n2. Coffee Mud Pie - covered with choc. syrup and a nice choc. cookie layer on the bottom. It reminded us of the mud pie served at Chart House when it used to be located down the peninsula years ago. \n\nOur waiter, Victor, was friendly and checked in on us continuously, offering to fill our water glasses multiple times.  I noticed my wine glass was still dirty when he brought it and took it back to exchange for a new glass.  Hubby did notice there was another wait staff who was setting up another table across the room and had dropped the bread plate on the floor but instead of taking it back to the kitchen, he continued to set the table.

That is absolutely disgusting, and a health violation. This is not a cheap place- pretty sure they can afford a box of gloves. \nWaiter took awhile to greet us. He was very quiet, didn't annunciate so he was hard to understand. He was nice, seemed attentive. \nFood was okay, nothing to write home about. My blackened chicken was flavorless, and not blackened. \n*Look at the bottom of your menu! They add 5% to your check to \"cover the cost of working in San Francisco\". Just beware. It's not worth it*", "author": "Kate O."}

I was a little trepidatious because of some of the first Yelp reviews and the low stars, but I was sold by the brand new, renovated building, the sailor-chic decor, the incredible views, and the tasty food...so we did it. And boy am I glad we did.\n\nStanley, the catering manager, was a pleasure to work with. Chart House's pricing per person for both the food and the beverage packages was very competitive for San Francisco (especially the bar packages) and they let me decorate however I wanted, bring in a photo booth, DJ, dance floor, cream puffs, you name it-- no extra fees. \n\nStanley was 100% up front about the cost and at the end of the night we paid exactly that. Our guests had a great time (especially marveling at the AMAZING views of the sea lions in their \"natural\" habitat, washed up on the docks right at the pier beneath our floor to ceiling windows!) We could hear them \"laughing\" right along with us as the toasts were made-- the view and the sounds that went along with it were just ridiculous and awesome. \n\nThe food was very tasty! People cleaned their plates, and I would have if I could have too! (Somehow you're always being pulled in one direction or another when its your own wedding, huh.)\n\nIn short, the food was excellent, the decor and restaurant itself was beautiful and worth the slog through the otherwise tourist-trappy Pier 39, and the service was top notch. Whatever service issues the Chart House had when it first opened, they are more than ironed out under Stanley's leadership. \n\nThank you Stanley and team for a great wedding reception! I'd do it again (but hopefully will never have to!)", "author": "Maya G."}

Other than that it's NOT WORTH IT. (This was my birthday dinner, keep in mind)\n\nEverything started off fine and I was excited because of the awesome seat we got. Our waiter came and then before even taking my boyfriend and my drink order he reached over us and grabbed the extra silverware on the table. Without being too direct, this is where we discovered that his hygiene was subpar. From this point on every time he came over to the table he kept reaching over our drinks and appetizers and it wasn't appetizing. The appetizers were okay: Calamari (too much sauce) , lobster bisque (I've had way better but wasn't horrible, just not great). \n\nSince we were planning on getting sweets at Fisherman's Wharf afterwards we both decided to share the Prime Rib dinner and added on the bacon Brussel sprouts. After we finished our appetizers we waited for our ONE entre. And waited. And waited. Waited.... After 35 minutes the food finally came out. At first sight I was disappointed to put it politely. For a $45 meal, it was COLD, undercooked and didn't look at all like what a nice restaurant would consider acceptable to serve. The Brussel sprouts looked like the came from a can or were boiled and they just three some bacon on it, no seasoning.... It was terrible to put it short. \n\nFinally once the waiter came to check on us, I was able to tell him we were going to pass on the meal and just take our check. He didn't say sorry, he didn't ask what was wrong, or how he could make it right. He just grabbed the plates and left for the check. Upon returning the check, he just dropped it off at the table and kept walking by briskly. Since he wasn't apologetic at this point that just got both of us frustrated and he lost the chance of a decent tip because of his bad attitude. I have nothing more to say about this place....

I've been a big fan of Chart House Restaurants for years and was very disappointed when they closed the Chart House's in Half-moon Bay and Maui. When I found a new Chart House I could not wait for the opportunity to share the Chart House dining experience with my wife.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful with classic ambiance and an amazing view. Unfortunately, that's the last positive statement I can make regarding this restaurant.  We were seated at a Bay front table and waited for about fifteen minutes before our waiter bothered to stop by our table. We ordered drinks, Diet Pepsi a Lemon Drop and the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and Crab, Shrimp, Avocado & Mango Stack for starters. At the same time, we asked for a basket of bread. TWENTY minutes went by before we received our drinks and another twelve minutes before the appetizers came. Ok, so a small point, The restaurant is in San Francisco; one would expect fresh crab and shrimp. Nope, the Crab, Shrimp, Avocado & Mango Stack was loaded with raw red onions and canned crab and frozen shrimp. The Coconut Crunchy Shrimp was actually good. Thank heavens because the rest of the meal was almost inedible. Both my wife and I started with the clam chowder which as very watery with little pieces of potato and clams. I don't know whether they make it fresh but canned soup is better. I'm used to creamy clam chowder with big pieces of potato and clams you can actually see. I could not bring myself to finish the soup.  At this point we should have left, but it was date night and I was enjoying the company of my beautiful wife. During our soup debacle, and after asking three times, the bread appeared! Again, this is San Francisco; sour dough bread is expected in restaurants by the water. Again, nope the breadbasket was filled with rolls, which most likely came from a Costco type bakery. Not even warmed much less freshly baked. It was evident why the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  For my main dish, I ordered the Captains Cut of Prime and my wife ordered Prime Rib but asked for an end cut (she is not a fan of medium temperature meat). Reservations were for 6:15 and we were seated at 6:25, our main course did not make it to the table until 7:50. Yep, an hour and twenty-five minutes enduring frozen shrimp and watery clam chowder before our main course meal was served. It only gets worse, pictures attached. When my Prime Rib was served it initially looked as if it might actually be good, well if you ignore the flab of fat almost as large as the cut of meat. Then, I took a bite and realized that the cut of meat was reheated on a grill, including grill marks. The meat was tough, and dry. My wife's cut of meat was just disgusting; an end cut is supposed to be a well done cut from the end side of the prime rib. Her cut was a large lump of gray-brown something and from who knows where staring back at her from the plate. We called our waiter over and when he found the time to visit our table offered to take one of the clam chowders off our bill. We asked for the manager and she did take my wife's dinner off the bill but left the clam chowder on the bill. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, check these out!\n\nI had such high expectations for this Chart House, and I'm truly amazed at how disappointing our experience turned out.

I asked our server Ashley for the manager and she sends out a very combative kitchen manager Melissa, who proceeds to tell me the order was put in for medium-well tuna. Are you kidding me? It was ordered seared twice! She offered to make me a third one and I kindly declined. \"Are you sure?\" she asked \"because I don't see you eating!\" Well, I usually don't pile food in my mouth when speaking... She then proceeds to tell my husband that the filet mignon he sent back was almost medium rare (more like medium well) in a chastising tone. Almost medium rare is not what he ordered. Our daughter's sea bass was so undercooked, it was gelatinous. Finally, restaurant manager (not the angry kitchen manager) approached our table and offered us dessert on the house as compensation. He returns 20 minutes later to ask how the dessert was... we tell him our server Ashley never stopped by after we asked for the manager, and that we have been waiting for water for almost an hour and our dessert. He tells us that's bc he's taken over for her. Wonderful.. so he should have known we never got the dessert. We just all stared at each other in disbelief. At that point, we opted to just leave and get dessert elsewhere. Worst Chart House experience EVER!! On the bright side, the views were spectacular and we enjoyed the rest of stay in San Francisco!", "author": "Cristina R."}

I really feel bad for tourists that stumble on this place.  We were often left with the feeling they only cared to fill seats with tourist that are just passing through rather than making a loyal customers for life. \n\nLet me first start out by saying when the food finally got to our table, everyones dish was extremely memorable although we waited so long for it to come we were still so hungry we ended up stoping at a street vendor for a snack. \n\nAfter being seated it took over 20 min for someone to come to our table just to tell us our server would be with us shortly!?!  (WTF, after 20 min can you please define shortly - how about some bringing us some water at least).  Finally after another 10 min one server came and took our drink order.   It would be another 20 min before he came back to take our food order and another 30 min for the food to actually come out.  During the course of our meal, our sever changed so many times, we had no idea who our server really was.  \n\nAs I said, the food was very memorable which is why I gave this place 2 stars.  However, in my option, you are paying for the amazing view of the bay at this place and that's about it.", "author": "Eric C."}

The food was very disappointing, my Dad had the fried fish platter and it was served cold.  It didn't look appetizing either.  My Mom had the swordfish, it was undercooked.  My parents hate sending food back or making a fuss so they ate it.  My partner had the prime rib topped with a mix of seafood and crab.  it looked really good and the temp was ok but sadly it lacked any real flavor.  I had the mac nut mahi, it was cooked ok and had ok flavor but it wasn't anything exciting.  Our starter soups were good, we had both kinds, but were not hot at all.

It ended up being more like 5 minutes and we were brought over to a BEAUTIFUL view. We could see Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge with nothing in the way. We were then promptly greeted by our server and given menus and our water glasses were filled. We ordered the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it was amazing. We ordered more horseradish because we like our cocktail sauce a bit hotter than they make it...think St. Elmo's. My Grandma and I split the beer battered fish and chips and it was delicious. The fries were perfectly done and the fish was flakey and flavorful and fried to perfection. The tartar sauce was super yummy. My Mom got the coconut shrimp and said it was really great. The coconut sauce was her favorite. My grandma also got the lobster bisque and said it was one of the better ones she has had.

First of all, the restaurant was not well lit at all. There were two candles on our table and a dimly lit ceiling light far away from the table, leaving us in mostly dark at 8:30 at night. The waiter was rude, had bad breath, and pushed each member of our party to order an extra side or dessert without telling us the price beforehand. I ordered a bread bowl with clam chowder- the bread was hard and felt stale, both the clam chowder and bread bowl were not warm (soup should be hot!), and the clam chowder smelled very fishy, which usually means the ingredients weren't that fresh. \n\nThe only redeeming quality was their garlic cheese bread- very good.", "author": "Kelly Y."}

To be fair, we were there for the view (which is spectacular). But we'd have loved to order more wine/drinks and our glasses sat empty for far too long on a day where they were far overstuffed for a holiday.

Traveled to SF this past Sunday night with family in from out of town, and we thought it might be nice to capture a sunset type dinner from Pier 39, given that one person in the group had never been to SF before. Pier 39 was crazy busy, even for Sept 17th. We walked up to a few of the restaurants, and 1 had the nerve to say there was a 2 hour way (even with plenty of open tables). In the end, we saw the Chart House, it appeared somewhat empty, and we had high hopes. \nWe were told by the rather not so nice hostess there would be a 25 minute wait. We said OK. But then after sitting on the sofa, I noticed there were about 20 open tables. I asked if we could be seated there, and she said they didn't have a server for that section. We eventually asked if we could go wait at the high top tables, and were told we could, and we were even brought menus. After waiting for about 10 minutes, the waiter who was nice enough came over and eventually took our drink and dinner order. About 5 minutes later the hostess came over and said our table was ready. We said we just ordered from the waiter, and she said that was unfortunate, because we could now NOT get seated at our table since we had officially ordered from the High Tops in the Bar Area. Really. Like we're supposed to know there internal rules.  By the way, there were 2 open tables just feet from where we were sitting down on the main floor level that eventually got filled, but a good 30 minutes into our time while there. So why couldn't we have just been seated there in the very beginning.\n\nEventually our salads were brought out, and one of them had the wrong dressing, while the other was the wrong salad altogether.\n\nThen the entrees came, and the person delivering the food says \"Who gets the pasta?  Who gets the salmon\".  you get the idea. For a restaurant charging these prices, would be nice if they put a bit more effort into the entire process. \n\nThe food was OK. But once again, just a bit more effort on management's part to really not just view the patrons as a once and done prospect would have gone a long way into getting a 3 to 4 star review. The location itself is amazing. They really need to view the dining experience through the customer's eyes as what happens from the moment they walk through the door until they leave. I would not go back, or if I did, I'd put in a reservation to ensure that I got seated on the main part of the floor and without a wait.", "author": "Roger S."}

We all had different items: artichoke appetizer, coconut shrimp, crab cake, clam chowder, chopped spinach salad, crab melt sandwich, and the kids chicken tenders for my friend's son.  Two of us shared a bottle of wine and the other had an old fashioned.   We tried to figure out if we all ate/drank the same stuff but we didn't.  Everyone ended up with weird stomachs later that evening.  My guess is that the food prep was not hygienic which is super scary.  \n\nService...not too hot either.  From the moment we walked in the door it was piss poor.  There were four hostesses staring at us and I asked for a table for four.  Her response was, 'For dinner?  Can I get a name?' Our name was taken and the we were immediately seated.....?????  I thought you only needed a name during a wait?????  Next, our server was aloof; barely around, seemed hassled to even be waiting on us and forgot food items that we had ordered.  Not sure if he was vaped out, hating his job or both.  \n\nI've been working in the service industry a very long time.

Obviously not having any experience bussing, she was struggling to get everything off the table, and didn't know what to do with the dirty dishes. At this point, you would assume the manager, or another busser, or any other employee would help, but no. I watched as the manager and the other hostess laughed and snickered as she struggled to prepare the table. It was a disgusting display to watch, and I was completely shocked that an employee could be treated so unfairly, especially by a manager (who is supposed to be there to help everyone). The food was alright, portion sizes were fairly small. After I had finished, I went up to speak to the young woman, who's name is Mimi. I told her I had witnessed the situation with the table needing to be bussed and reset, and her response was \"Oh, it's alright, it happens a lot to me here\". At this point I was speechless.

That included appetizers, soup, and entrees.  Not unreasonable, but not cheap, either.

Not one person came over to refill our water. Then the entrees and soups came out at the same time. Horribly timed food service. After eating the soup, all of the entrees were cold and had to be sent back. Again, no one was around to offer water and check on how we like the entrees. \nThe manager came over and apologized several times but this felt extremely disingenuous and forced.

Unfortunately, our phones were dead so we couldn't look at the Yelp reviews before hand. The food took forever -- we were in the restaurant for about 2 hours and when it finally came the fish was under seasoned and dry and came with vegetables, sauce and salsa all over it that we didn't ask for. We ordered mahi fish, seasoned with lemon and the fish pasta which was passable, but not good enough for the prices here.

I had the Seafood Cobb Salad, my husband had the Crab Melt, and my son had the Fish and Chips.  My salad cost $21 and had canned crab meat, no flavor, and was super small.  It said it came with Dungeness crab, it was the worse tasting Dungeness crab I have ever eaten.  This \"Cobb\" salad came with Thousand Island dressing.  Thousand Island dressing is typically for a \"Louie\" and a Cobb is typically served with blue cheese.  So my husband ordered the \"Dungeness\" Crab Melt, again don't know what crab they were using but he said it had no flavor and tasted like canned crab meat.  He figured it was a melt so it would be between two pieces of bread but it was open-faced, the menu never indicated that.  We paid $19.50 for a small open-faced sandwich with a huge plate of fries that were way over salted, and I love salt and they were too salty for me. No my son who is 15 ordered the Fish and Chips, he liked his fish and chips but my husband observed that they were frozen not fresh fish and chips. They were very symmetrical, indicating they were mass produced and frozen.  We paid $19 for his pre-frozen fish and chips that we could have made at home for $4.99.  We don't mind paying $100 plus for dining out but my God make it worth out money.  So my complaint doesn't end there.  The food took well over 30 mins, closer to 40mins to get and the service was mediocre at best.  These were complicated items that had a lot of cooking time and the place wasn't packed or super busy.  So disappointed.  I wished I had taken the time to take some picks. I am not one to complain but I felt the need to warn people.  Go somewhere else, there are plenty of places to go on Pier 39.

We were going to order dessert but when we found out that the lava cake was going to take 30 minutes, we said no and just give us the check. The server said that he was going to check if they had an extra cake in the back that's ready and if they did, he asked if we wanted it. We said sure. He came back about 5 minutes later and said that they have one ready. He put a couple of forks and napkins for us and left. We assumed that he was getting it but after about 10 minutes, he reappeared at the table next to us and proceeded to get their orders. When he was done, my husband flagged him and told him that we don't think we have anymore time to wait for the lava cake and to just cancel it. He said \"oh let me check on it\" and was about to leave again. At this point I was really frustrated and firmly said \"No, just forget about it and give us the check.\" I felt like he was trying to play us and buy time so we wouldn't notice that it's been almost the same time as it would have been if they didn't have an \"extra\" cake that's ready to go. \n4.

This location was beautiful but pretty much everything else about it was HORRIBLE! once we were seated we asked for water and it took 20 min for the waitress to come to us and we asked for water again, which came about 10 min. after that. The poor waitress seemed stress but was so young and did not have the best etiquette ( walked away from us or other tables before people were done talking). It took about 15 min. just to  get our drinks ( alcoholic) and we had ordered an app. at the same time which took about 30 min. to brig out ( lobster mac n cheese). The main course also took about 30-40 min. My husband ordered a swordfish which was delicious, I ordered prime rib medium rare and it came out PINK AND BLEEDING.  We ended up sending the prime rib back and canceled it because we didn't want to wait 40 more min,. for another meal! We definitely wont be surprised if this place closes with in the next year!", "author": "Jessica S."}

Took 25 minutes to get drinks and bread there were only 7 tables that had people at them. It was not even 10% full. They forgot one of our appetizers. Brought our desserts out at seperated times and by seperate times I mean my boyfriend has finish his before I got mine. The lava cake was luke warm. I waited an extra 15 minutes for a Luke warm lava cake? The only bathroom had throw up all over and was not able to be in use. Than when I got the manager over she was making excuses for as to why things are the way they are. It was my boyfriends birthday which I had told when I made the reservations and nothing was done of it. No candle or anything. We got a small.  $25 comp for the whole dinner being awful. The manager was rude to us because we were unhappy. The reason for the comp on the check was: upset.

It took our server 10 minutes to even acknowledge us, that should have been when we got up and walked out but we were starving so we stayed. Maybe he was busy so give him some grace right? It just went downhill from there. Took longer to get our drinks and even longer to take our orders. \"I'll be back in 2 minutes to take your order\" turned into 10. 10 minutes waiting and then another 10 to take our order? The wait to get our bland entrees was ridiculous too (I don't hold the server responsible for the taste of the food but he never even checked back so I couldn't ask for extra dressing or more ketchup) Seriously the worst service I've had in years. The table behind us literally asked the manager what was taking the server so long. She said she'd try to get him back on track but it sure didn't happen while we were there. If the server is that bad, that reflects on poor management. If he's that busy help him out! or if he's that slow, let him go. The first time ever in my life that I've left $0 for a tip. Honestly that bad.", "author": "Shannon B."}

Even though I knew this was a 2 star my husband and I decided to make a reservation and try it out anyway, we came in with low expectation. Glad we did. Was seated and waited 15 minutes until our server came, he was nice but ultimately just mediocre service. My husband and I both ordered prime rib, mine came out well done although the chef flipped it over to show the pinker sides and my husband ordered medium rare, which came out medium. It wasn't until the end of the meal that the server advised us of how the meat is typically prepared, probably good in share that prior to having a customer order. Only good part was I didn't pay for my meal but other than that this place was pretty horrible. I do not recommend.", "author": "Amy R."}

What is totally unacceptable is the inability of the kitchen to cook a steak to proper temperature and deliver food hot, or at least warm. Steaks were over cooked or borderline raw. Mashed potatoes were room temperature and the Caesar salad was an absolute joke. Even the coffee was lukewarm. For this price point, this was without a doubt, the worst meal I have ever had.

We asked him about our appetizer and soup, the woman who took our order quickly ran off towards the kitchen. It was too late for us.

We came with a group and asked to have a seat overlooking the sea lions and the hostess told us she would \"see what [she] could do\".  After waiting for over 30 minutes, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant.  It turns out that all of the seating overlooking the sea lions is closed off and reserved for large, private groups only.  When we asked about the one open table near a window with a partial view, the hostess told us that a private party was in that area and we weren't allowed to sit there.  She said nobody can be seated in the area near the sea lions.  So, \"seeing what she could do\" was dishonest; she just waited until any table was available and probably figured we would be so hungry at that point we would stay anyway.

You've got problems with the Chart House on Pier 39  - we were there for a 7:30 dinner last Saturday night and the place was half full (at best).  Here's why:  1. We don't want to eat barbecue seafood New Orleans style when we are in San Francisco.  So cut out the Cajun seasonings on the Shellfish Iron Skillet. 2.  Get more servers!  Even with a half empty house, the servers seemed like they couldn't keep up.  Our water glasses were never refilled, rolls weren't ready but had to be baked (what?  Did you not expect people to be eating rolls that night?) 3.  Lemon juice is put in water to keep artichokes from turning color, not to add flavor or make them vinegary.  We couldn't taste any artichoke flavor in your steamed artichokes they were so lemony and sour.  Save yourself some money, cut back on the lemon juice and give the customers a better tasting artichoke. 4.  If you insist on using your \"spice blend\" in clam chowder, at least cut it way back so that the clams, potatoes and cream have a chance to shine.  Even better, cut it out. So do these things, tell people you have reworked your menu and hope you get a second chance.

It is so unfortunate because as stated its prime location beautiful views , but it stops there. I believe his name was Billy our server was one of the most un personable servers I have ever come in contact with. No expression , interaction, anything whatsoever..very monotone voice. Like seriously ...I think he escaped from Alcatraz across the way and became the walking dead server at Chart House. I won't go into complete detail., although still in shock how a place like the Chart House could put their customers through such a dining experience. We were from out of town but had had good memories of the Chart House, because don't they have one in Dana point ,Ca.? My friend got married there and it was top notch.
