I didn't have one but they are known for their martinis and drink-wise, not much else.  \n\nBecause this is in such a touristy area of Haight-Ashbury, there's a wide audience that come in and if you grab a seat at the bar, you can hear some pretty hilarious conversations as the bartender throws shade at everyone.  For example someone asked what whiskey drinks they have and he replies 'I dunno, whiskey and ice?' You have to have a sense of humor in this place, which I can tell from some of the reviews that people don't get it.  \n\nI sat in here for a few drinks and the bartender did warm up to me.  You just have to know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nI got a few whiskey drinks including old fashioneds.  The bartender made them strong!

Bourdain was correct that they make amazing martinis (gin or vodka), but they have a bigger selection of cocktail drinks than implied.  No dumb mixers mind you, mainly old style cocktails.\n\nThe decor is something out of casablanca, having a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern influence.  Above all though, they do serve bottled beers and simple drinks like whiskey and coke.  But if you come to this bar, you have to buy a martini.  Why you may ask? Because it's that F!@#$!#@$! great!  \n\nMore importantly, the bartenders aren't as stuck up as Bourdain made it seem (neither are the denizens of SF, but a point of another time).  They easily welcomed our whole group although this was rather large.  We were especially obnoxious for coming right at last call, but he made a delicious stiff drink regardless.  \n\nCome for the martinis and great vibes!", "author": "Joel Christian A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-15", "description": "Aub Zam Zam is one of the Bucket List Bars to visit in San Francisco.  It's reputation is well-deserved.  I have spent more than a few hours in bars across the country and I can think of no place that is like this place.  And, I have to laugh at some of the reviews that you'll find on Yelp.  Oh, 1 Star folks...  You simply don't know your history.  \n\nOh, how rich is the history.  Zam Zam is a beautiful bar in the Haight which is first and foremost defined by its stunning Middle Eastern decor.  The centerpiece is the horseshoe shaped bar that surrounds a gorgeous mural.  As you walk in you are quickly transported off of Haight Street into a world that could come out of the movies.  The lighting is dark and there are many spots to grab a seat and a quiet conversation.  No TV's.  No pretension.  Just a classic bar with classic drinks.  Cash only.  \n\nTo hear Yelp reviewers gripe about service ignores any sense of the man who built this bar.  Bruno Mooshei was a man who had his standards and expected people to meet them in his establishment.  Read through some of the articles from when he passed - this man was an institution because he had his vision.  He wasn't afraid to tell people to leave if they were not part of that vision.  As Omar once said in The Wire:  \"A Man has to have a Code\".  It isn't exactly quite that way anymore, but there is still an edge.  This is a drinkers bar.  This is a place for people who have authenticity.  \n\nThe poison of choice here is the Gin Martini.  This bar was once called by Herb Caen the \"Holy Shrine of the Dry Martini\".  Ice cold.  Straight up.  They have a full bar and I have found the bartenders to be pretty darn cool.  Sitting at the horseshoe bar, looking at the mural and drinking a gin martini makes a man feel pretty damn smart for a few minutes.  It brings you back to a simpler time.  Don't miss this experience.", "author": "Adam S."}

We were looking for a place to just have drinks and hangout after dinner. I've been here once before but quickly, for a shot. \nI usually order vodka sodas but I noticed everyone was drinking martinis so I decided what the heck, may as well try something different. I also noticed an article on the wall that Zam Zam had been making martinis since the 40's so I figured they're must be doing something right. Also, the bar isn't pretentious like a lot of them in SF can be. \nThe martinis's were amazing, so delicious and very strong. The bartender , he was very nice as well as the security. The patrons there friendly too. We ended up staying there until last call. We left Zam Zam making new friends . I'll go there every time I'm in SF.", "author": "Nadia G."}

I should preface by saying that I live 2 blocks from Zam Zam and have visited this bar about 15 times in the last 3 years. This is NOT the first time I've had a bad experience with the bartender in this situation, but tonight was the worst.   \n    I went into Zam Zam tonight and had a pretty pleasant time talking with some of the bar regulars and after having had 1 beer realized I needed to get some more cash out so I go to the ATM get 80$ out and order another drink. I should first mention that during the time it took for me to drink one beer(30mins) the bartender had 2 shots with a regular sitting next to me. That being said I get my change back and I got 1$. I got the bartenders attention and let her know her know I gave her a 20$ and that my change was incorrect ...no harm done yet if I could get the correct change. She snapped at me saying \"you gave me a 10$\" yet she still angrily gave me the correct change after hesitating for a couple minutes...all while continuing to repeat that I was wrong. \n     She then continued to give me attitude and wouldn't speak to me as I tried asking her over to speak to her about the situation in hopes to clear the air. I didn't touch my drink or the change and when I finally got her to talk to me I asked (having been in there many times before and served by her on a few occasions) \"Why would I go get money out just to try to scam you for a few dollars? You've seen me in here at least a few times before.\" Her response being \"At this point I don't really give an F*** what you're trying to do. I've had a long weekend and I just wanna get the hell out of here so there's nothing to talk about. Take the damn money. I don't wanna talk about it.\"\n\nNow the last thing I want to do is try to wind down with a drink while sitting at a bar in which the inebriated bartender is convinced you're trying to steal from them. So instead of any form of an apology from her she just says in a threatening way\"all I know is at the end of the night ..if my drawer is off then I'll know it was you.\" \n\nSo I left the untouched drink and ALL of the leftover change and I let her know why I was leaving. Enjoy the extra 20$\n\nLook, we all have bad days but if you're willingly gonna work in the service industry then at least do a better job at not taking it out on your customers. I'd giver her the benefit of the doubt but after talking to my bartender roommates and finding out they have had similar experiences with her, and judging by the multiple bad reviews regarding her attitude, this isn't the first time. \n\nI wont be returning ...at least while she's at the bar. Such a bummer because I always liked how laid back that spot was.", "author": "Max S."}

Worst bartenders, employees, and customer crowd in the whole neighborhood! If I could give them 0 stars I would. One off duty bartender locked her dog in a tiny closet for so long it started barking and disrupting the peace so we said something. After spending over $100 on cocktails we thought it was appropriate to request that the dog stop barking. Not to mention how inhumane it is to leave your dog locked in a closet! Both the bartender who was working at the time and the off duty bartender/dog owner started yelling at us and defending the dogs bark, so we left.\n     We quickly realized the off duty bartender was waiting for us outside and began antagonizing us and instantly head butted my husband. What a psycho! If Yelp allowed profanity I'd be using it here to describe her and her cheap, violent, scary behavior. She sucks at head butting and missed his nose but split his lip open. No one at Zam Zam's helped break up the crazy woman attacking my husband - a very scary visual.

I ended up finally establishing a relationship with other regulars and the amazing Kundan as well who clued me into the fact that I'd get more bang for my buck if I ordered a Titos Martini instead of a Titos Greyhound which is my go-to drink.

When we first entered, there was barely anyone there (maybe 5 other people including the bartender). The room was dim and it was quiet. The bartender immediately asked us to show all of our ID's. My friend, Kathy and I needed to use the restroom, so we left our ID's at the bar while the bartender checked and went for the restroom.\n\nWe were actually using the restroom, not just to mess around or do anything stupid. However, I do admit we were just cracking jokes while waiting on each other (It was a one stall bathroom). Out of no where, the bartender barges into the restroom and just stares at us (at this point, Kathy and I were both done using the toilet and were just cleaning up), and we felt so uneasy by the way she just stood there and stared at us so I asked her \"do you need to use the restroom.....) and she said \"no\" and so Kathy and I were like.. umm okay?... strange.. anyways, she left the restroom without saying anything else.\n\nKathy and I were still in the restroom for another minute or so cleaning up and laughing (we laugh a lot with each other - and no we were not under the influence). Then the bartender once again comes into the restroom and said \"The restroom is for customers only, and your friends outside told me you two weren't going to order anything, so...\" and Kathy and i were just thinking wtf..???? who the hell is this lady. By the way, Kathy was going to order a drink, and she told the bartender that. The bartender then says \"well you're friends didn't have cash (it's a cash only bar btw) so they all left\"... Kathy and I were still so shocked by this woman's attitude. We then said we are done using the restroom and then she left. We followed her back to the bar to see that our friends were all gone, so we were about to just walk out too and she said \"You want your ID back?\" (attitude tone of voice) and I said \"yeah\" so she gave it to me.\n\nWhen we got outside, we saw our friends and they said they didn't have cash so they want to go to the ATM to get cash and come back. Kathy and I did not want to come back in there after what we just encountered, we told them what had just happened to us. My other friend Jen told us that when we were in the restroom, she was trying to take a picture of the bar area and the bartender told her that she can't take pictures at the bar, and so Jen told her that she technically wasn't sitting at the bar, and the bartender said \"you have a point\".. and then when Jen and my other friends said they didn't have cash and had to leave to get cash, the bartender said \"Is this because I told you you couldn't take a picture\". It was stupid... Needless to say, we didn't come back.\n\nThe way that bartender treated Kathy and I was especially rude. I can't believe how rude she was. Seriously, there was no line for the restroom, and we were serious about sitting down and buying drinks. But she definitely changed our minds about being there. I would not recommend this place!

It was hard to ignore them because their voices were at a decent volume. No big deal, obviously...\n\n...until we heard them talking shit about Los Angeles. Now listen, I don't give a flying fuck if someone doesn't love my city. It ain't for everyone, and I would prefer most snooty transplants go back to whatever shitty town they came from and leave us natives alone. However, the bartender decided to partake in the shit talking and that is beyond rude and ignorant. You're an employee at an establishment that probably sees more tourists than locals, so disrespecting people from other cities is in poor taste. I don't give a shit if it's a dive bar. Act like you've been somewhere.\n\nThis wasn't just about the criticism of my city - I hit my limit when they all started talking shit about the people. Yes, the people from LA, aka my sister and me. I went up to the bar for more drinks and spoke up, because I felt like putting these idiots in their places. One guy, clearly the drunkest, sounded downright idiotic with his \"LA ISNT A CITY THOUGH CUZ LIKE U GOTA DRIVE EVERYWHERE\" and the bartender, trying desperately to backtrack on all the shit I heard her talk, explained that she lived in LA for a \"little bit\" when she was in the entertainment biz, so those are the only types of people she hung around.\n\nAnyway, I'm going off on a tangent here. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. San Francisco's a beautiful city, but transplants like that bartender (because, of course, she wasn't from either LA or San Francisco and neither were the two bozos talking to her) need to be mindful of the shit that comes out of her mouth when in the presence of mixed company.", "author": "Norma M."}

They were chatty but not overly so.\n\nThe bartender looked like one of the Bowery Boys, like he could work at a shipyard in Philadelphia -- Popeye muscles, tattoos and hat pushed down low. He was no nonsense and made a good Manhattan. The atmosphere is dark, there are a lot of nooks and crannies to get in lost in and have a private conversation but the ten or so seats around the bar are the prize.

The barstaff puts you at ease though. The afternoon guy (bar opens at 3 p.m.) was a trip. Very nice and polite and you could tell he loved the bar he worked at.\n\nThe drink prices are decent here ... they have a very hard to use jukebox (both hard to use and jukebox being important things in dive bar culture) and the overall atmosphere is laid back when its not crowded.\n\nIt used to be that the Martini was the go-to drink here, expertly crafted and served the way the crusty old bartender wanted to serve it.

I would say the bar service is \"adequate\", and maybe even a little above average. You don't go here to get the best drink in the city. You are going for the people. And the people are not going to be what you expect.\n\nNo matter how people are shaped or look on the surface, this spot is a magnet for the interesting. Almost every time I've gone there I've met people that I've formed deep bonds with. It's a wonder I don't go there more often but I think the universe just calls me to be there when \"it's time\".\n\nInteresting facts: Fun juke box. Circular bar (it's really interesting in the sense that everyone ends up \"facing each other\"). The shape of the bar alone is a \"conversation catalyst\".  There are some small tables around too. There is always someone standing because of the limited seating, but I find that if you are there a reasonable amount of time you'll be awarded with a perch.\n\nI don't doubt that the bartenders need to deal with some interesting folks from time to time so I think it's a mistake to take anything personally that happens upon first walking in there.  I've never been treated rudely.\n\nI dare you to go and not have a great time. But it's like fishing. Just go in and wait for it to happen. Don't be in a rush.

I came to Zam-Zam for my roommates' birthday last night and had a blast. I loved the Middle Eastern theme, dark lighting and interesting Arabic architecture throughout. The graceful arches of the ceiling are beautiful, and act almost as a sound barrier between each of the two sections of the bar. We were able to hear every witticism we uttered - we're a VERY witty bunch, every random question from an obviously wasted older gentleman who enjoyed quizzing us on every juke-box song, and every drunken slurred birthday toast that was made. \r\n\r\nThe lowish ceilings and friendly bartenders help create an intimate and casual setting, and though the juke-box could be a little louder, it oozed the rich textured vocals of Frank Sinatra and jazz classics, while still allowing people to talk.  The crowd was relaxed, glad that it was Thursday  and there was no 'who's that?' scene.

Well, he wasn't very happy to hear that i would not accept a free drink. He pestered us about it a lot, small talked us for far too long, and finally when he realized that i was unwavering (thanks for that personality trait, mom!) , he gave us (me) $20 and told me to do what i wanted with it.\n\nWell then!

They make their drinks strong, and there are usually very friendly people inside. One time I thought I was being propositioned by a much older woman [see: cougar], but she mentioned her husband, so I can assume she was just talkative.

And Zam Zam is a well that is located 20 meters east of the Kaaba, in Mecca, the holiest place in Islam. So \"Aub Zam Zam\" means Zam Zam Water, the water that is considered sacred that comes out of the zamzam well. The story goes that Hajar, wife of Abraham, was with their infant son, desperately seeking water, being a hot dry dessert valley and all. The son, Ishmael, started scraping the ground with his feet and water suddenly sprang out. To this day people go there to collect this sacred water. \n\nThat being said, and the fact that alcohol is often forbidden within state-controlled Islamic countries, I think many people are missing out on the irony of the bar's name.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI came here the other night post Citrus Club and pre BRMC @ GAMH.

It's so much better now.  Nonetheless, let's say three cheers for History - and I'll give you the run down.\n\nFor decades the place was owned and run by a fellow named Bruno.  Bruno would not serve you if any of the following was the case: \n(1) You were not seated at a stool at the bar (yes, the place always had chairs and tables, and you could always sit at them, but you'd never get a drink);\n(2) He didn't like the way you looked;\n(3) He didn't like the way you talked;\n(4) He didn't approve of your drink order;\n(5) Any little thing about you rubbed him the wrong way.\n\nNow, Bruno would normally not overtly refuse to serve you, he would just ignore you until you went away.  It was amusing to watch.  Bruno was crotchety.  He preferred to make martinis, and little else.  My personal Bruno story went like this:\nMe:  \"Bruno - what kind of gin makes the best martini?\"\nBruno: [in gravely irritated voice] \"Aaah it's all the same shit.\"\nMe:  \"Ok, I'll have a Tanqueray martini, dry, please.\"\nBruno: \"You don't want Tanqueray.  It's crap.  Bombay Sapphire - that's what you want.\"\n\nBruno died about a decade ago, may he rest in peace.  One of his nephews, I am told, bought the bar, or inherited it, or something.\n\nNowadays, the drinks are stiff, the bartenders are friendly, the crowd is diverse and unpretentious, the place is comfortable.  If I go out for drinks in my neighborhood, this is the place I go, 90% of the time.  I am partial to Wednesdays.", "author": "Joe C."}

They're not still enforced, as the original owner has passed away. A beautiful and trivia-laden woman took me to the Aub Zam Zam recently (I'm a pretty damned lucky guy), and filled me in on the backstory. It strikes me that without this history, the bar could be mistaken for just another oddly decorated and slightly rundown joint, especially as the years since the owner's passing slip away. Aub Zam Zam is more than it lets on.\n\nMy one visit to the Aub Zam Zam was just enough to order a gin martini, no olive, with a twist (wonderfully delicious, by the by) and sip it in the wonderfully old-school atmosphere of the back room, decorated and architected in a distinctly Persian motif. \n\nI believe I'll return to the Aub Zam Zam at some point. That martini really was fantastic, and this coming from someone who's doesn't select gin as a first, second, or third choice alcohol. Now if someone had some insight as to whether \"Aub Zam Zam\" means anything, or is just a really cool name, I'd be happy to hear it.\n\nUpdate:\n\nFrom the same afore-mentioned woman, I've learned that \"Aub Zam Zam\" means \"fountain of youth\", according to Herb Caen.

Sometimes if you call a particular brand of liquor they will pour it the first time, but change it back to the well on your next round unless you remind them.

We were really only there to visit some sexy-time stores as me and my husband were on our honeymoon.\n\nFIrst of all, we needed to pee. Bad. I think of becoming a customer strictly for the purposes of toilets as an inevitable but worth-it reality some days. Especially at a bar where you can think of the bathroom as a 5$ charge and the drink as an on-the-house treat.\n\nSecond of all, our Makers and sodas from the prior night, and our champagne drizzle were all singing tiny anthems in my mind still. Not hangover melodies, but sweet fuzzy songs of love and weddings and money trees, and honeymoons. So, it being about 4pm, was time for a drink.\n\nThird. Jukeboxes sadden me these days. Probably because I moved away from the super-cool jivester hymns of Echo Park and Portland, and wound up again in the high country, the gold mines, where meth moms and angry old ex-playboys run bars like one might run a strip club, with only the slutty in mind while programming the jukebox. (That statement does NOT include the Mine Shaft's or The National Hotel's music machines) So I am SICK of Christina and Pink and Pearl Jam and Martina McBride. A real unique solid jukebox is worthy of paying for a million drinks. This one had Tom Waits, and old weary blues-people, and I am sure a little Nina Simone, and probably even some French perfume. \n\nSo we stayed. A couple in the corner was playing Scrabble. My Makers and Soda was divine, and my husbands beer was cold and something not available in the picturesque dive bars of Nevada City.

The atmosphere is fun - Middle Eastern theme with appropriate decor. Very 1950s.  Dim lighting and decent music.

I think that Bruno was a bit heavy handed, but he did manage to protect the place from the ignorant savagery of the Upper Haight.\n    My memories of that time evoke a softness of light over red velvet, the dignified authority of the circular bar, and the magic of the twinkling bottles behind it.  All of this created a setting where the holiness of the creation of the martini transported the drinker to a timeless spot, a room in a constructed memory that was so nice to dip into when the grimy monotony of the city street got you down.\n   The Aub Zam Zam that my brother and I walked into was a crowded shit hole.  Amateur drunks have kicked in the wood paneling, torn up the fabric on the walls, ground their filth into the velvet floors, graffittied the bathroom, and damaged the furniture.  And there is no sense of a loving touch to the place, or even the hand that tries to heal a wound.  It has been left to rot in the fashion of an abandoned carcass that has putrefied beyond the nibbles of the lowest scavenger.  Like too many spots in the Haight, this place is a good trip gone bad.", "author": "Buck K."}

An older bartender (not Bruno, as he had already passed away a few years priot), was nice enough, but a little rough around the edges. This place was dark and moody; just a notch above a dive, but no less loved as a local gem. We wanted to feel like fancy adults, so, at 16 (my friend was 21), we ordered dirty martinis. They were delicious and needless to say, after only two of them, we stumbled out of there like angry, old poets and wandered the city in a foggy, distant haze. I returned to Aub Zam Zam two years ago for a gin and tonic. A friend of mine wanted to check it out, and the vibe was exactly as I remembered it, but the drinks were not as good. This place has some sort of history behind it, and you can feel it when you look around and absorb the surroundings. Would I come back?

Let me break it down:\nOccasion: Leopard Print Birthday Bar Hopping!\nArrival time: Aprox. 10:00 PM.\nCrowd: Not too much, but it was a particularly cold and yucky night, so it might have been that there weren't much people out.\nAtmosphere: Very chilaxing. The lighting in the place is dim, but not so dark you have to reach for you phone and use it as a flashlight. I don't really remember the music, but that isn't necessarily bad as it suggests I could actually enjoy conversations with friends without having to yell at them. I found that to be refreshing.\nDrinks: The bartender tending that night was very good and very flexible. He was willing to make drink for us that he never made before. Friends of mine had ordered an Espresso Martini at a bar in NY and asked if they could have something similar. The bartender warned it was the first time he would make it, so to be honest and tell him if we enjoyed it. It turned out AWESOME... we all had at least two.\nSize of bar: This place is tiny, but has room in the back for a large group. \n\nOverall, this would be a great bar to either make a pit stop on your bar hopping extravaganza or a place to chill after a good dinner for some tasty and reasonably priced drinks. \n\nAnd what made this places THAT much more amazing, is I had left my cell phone in the bar, so when I called the next day to find out if they had located it, I discovered they had stowed it away in a safe place until the owner returned to claim it. So super cool.\n\nI gave this 4 and not 5 stars because it was the first time I had gone, so I'll definitely  go again to see if its truly worth 5... which I'm sure it will be.\nCheers!", "author": "Michele H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-11", "description": "A long time ago in a far away land .. I was told to check out this bar on Haight Street called Aub Zam Zam. The rumor mill had this establishment pegged as a martini bar with a ruthless, snappy, and bitter old man working behind the bar. Although, martinis were his trademark, he made the drinks how he desired. He also choose to open and close the bar at his convenience. He would only allow particular people to come into his bar. If you were not welcome he would ask you to leave or ignore you. There was no such thing as convincing him. Eventually, you would figure it out because he would NOT take the time to serve you. Now you can see why I was so hesitant in checking out this peculiar spot.\n\nAs far as the rumors went, they were TRUE~ very very TRUE! The man who owned the bar and the whole damn building, was named Bruno. Aub Zam Zam was his martini playhouse during his lifetime .. until he passed away last year and left the bar to friends (((God Bless His Soul))). Since the new owners have taken over the direction of the bar has changed for the best. The bar seems more welcoming (of course) and they serve beer, alcohol, and wine. Martinis are not a thing of the past .. they do have exceptional martinis but if you want vodka instead of gin it IS possible. The bartenders are HOTTIES too, from what I have seen.\n\nI admit that I do tend to space every now and then but with a jukebox full of jazzy material that I am not into, it is easy to daydream. Personally, I would prefer a little more upbeat music. I really think that this would add to the atmosphere of the bar. I do understand that each place has its own sound but I think they need a new one! It is SO easy to doze off while sipping on your drink sitting at the half oval shaped bar. Speaking of drinks .. I believe they are relatively cheap. Of course, I have had the luck of having many of my drinks bought for me. It is a great place to meet an acquaintanance, a date, or an old friend. They have booths along the wall and tables in the back. The bar is small but it also can hold the prefect crowd. It seems to me that the community still has no clue what the bar is all about or what kynd of people are patrons. The bottom line is this is a lounge bar with a jukebox full of jazzy material that is probably getting more hype now then ever before. It is definitely worth your time to check it out, it has changed over the years for the better! I am sure Brunos spirit still lingers around the bar, maybe that is why the jukebox has never changed .. When you get the chance, check it out, the Aub Zam Zam is a great starter bar with some GOOD eye candy!", "author": "Tamara M."}

We were waiting to see a movie at the Vic and moised in for a cold one.  The dim lighting with the red accents did it for me, that's for sure (there is nothing more sexy then red) and there was an intangible hint of romance in the air (it also could have been something in the drinks... their mantra on their napkins: \"Come, fill the cup, and in the fires of spring- the winter garments of repentance fling\").   We sat in a little, secluded spot with a stiff gin & tonic and chatted, both hearts aflutter.  Things have been fabulous ever since.\r\n\r\nI made it back in there one afternoon bc of their great 3-6pm happy hour ($2 & change well drinks!) and got the scoop from Bob.  Zam Zam was a family-run biz that opened in the 40's with an owner who was a strict 'tender that didn't take any crap.  He was notorious for throwing people out of his bar for the slightest bit of insolence.  When I was in there, some older woman attested to this bc her husband had been thrown out when he made a beeline for the jukebox before the bar!  Bob, who used to be a regular, took over to salvage the bar when the owner passed away.  The half-moon shaped bar faces an amazing mural that dates back to when it first opened and the old school ambiance is complete with an ancient cash register and a single black & white photo of women in furs and their men sitting at that very bar more than half a century ago.  It's great to find a spot in the Haight that embraces an era long before flower power... when class and charisma were all that mattered.

The last time I was in the bar, the manager told me and I was so sad he compted my and my friend's drinks.  That was very nice!  This is still my fav bar in the City.  Although Bruno's demise led to a slight renovation, I SO DIG the old Hollywood 1940's Persian theme.  The colors, dim lighting and the out of the way location (a 1940's bar doesn't seem to fit the stuck-in-the-60's hippy surroundings of Haight Street).  Bruno WAS a Martini-Nazi, but I never had a problem.  First time there with the boyfriend, he gave me zero attitude, and actually gladly made me a Bacardi & Coke.  I thought my boyfriend would kill me for not ordering a martini -- it always helps to have a nice rack!  :o)", "author": "A W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-04-17", "description": "After reading a million reviews about this bar, I was totally intrigued. apparently it used to be owned by a guy named Bruno, who was notorious for kicking people out if they ordered a drink he didn't like, or asked to have their martini served with vodka, or really for any damn reason he chose. this guy was the best bartender ever and everyone loved him. unfortunately, he passed away a few years back, so when I went to the bar a couple weeks back, there was no Bruno there. *sigh*.\n\nwalking into this bar felt like taking a step back in time. the bar itself was a very small horseshoe bar with only a few stools around it. there were a few other tiny tables, but really this place is all about sitting at the bar. I wrote earlier that the Lone Palm bar reminded me of an old movie, but this place reminded me of that even more so. light jazz was playing on the jukebox, the waiter was dressed nicely, and the place mainly served martinis. I really dug the vibe there. also, oddly enough, it also had a kind of middle eastern feel to it too.\n\nI've never really drank martinis, but decided that I should give it a shot since I was here. it's great when you can just give the bartender free reign to make whatever they please and they invent something great for you. I hate it when you ask the bartender to recommend something, and they can't be bothered to choose a drink for you or be creative at all. the bartender at Aub Zam Zam whipped up a special martini for us made from Hendrick's gin, which is infused with rose petals and cucumbers. she also added cucumber garnish and some other stuff and the drink was really good... super refreshing. Later in the evening, we overheard her mention the \"Hillary special\". when we asked what that was, she said it changes from time to time, and we decided to go for it. she ended up making us two completely different drinks, one of them a sour one similar to a sidecar, and the other one was some crazy chocolate concoction. both were super good.\n\nthere was really something about this place that makes me want to go back. I so wish this could be my local neighborhood bar...\n\n(my resolution this year is to visit 50 new bars in SF.  read about it at: http://fiftybars.thisisvlad.com)", "author": "vlad k."}

The bar is part of San Francisco history and urban folklore and has been around for decades. The previous owner nicknamed \"the martini nazi\" used to kick people out if he didn't like you or order in a certain way . . .luckily it is under new ownership and the small bar capable of perhaps seating no more than 20 is a popular destination for young professionals and even the occasional writers groups. The bartenders there are extremely laid back and friendly and make a mean martini.", "author": "Sequoia N."}
