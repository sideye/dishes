I went in on a Monday around 9:30 a.m.\u200b to grab some of their \u200bturkey sandwiches and some coffee. First I go to the deli. I am literally the only person in the entire store other than the employees and the gent at the counter makes me wait 5 minutes. No 'hello I'll be right with you,' not even a nod just busy work. Finally,\u200b he looks at me and nods and I ask for 3 turkey sandwiches. Again, no greeting/how can I help you just barely a blink and starts working. \n\nI go grab some self-serve coffees. To save a minute I tell the lady at the cash register I am getting 3 turkey sandwiches and two coffees, can you please charge me? \"Nope,\u200b I have to scan them first.\" O,\u200bk that's a bit silly as they are obviously already coded in the cash register but I'll wait. Again. I am still the only customer in the entire store now. \n\nFinally from the deli man, \"sandwiches done!\" No thank you, no nothing, just the bag of sandwiches left on the counter. Ok I'm fine you're having a bad morning, I get it. \n\nI return over to the cashier lady with my bag of 3 identical sandwiches. I pull one out and say here we go charge me for this times 3 and we're all set. Nope,\u200b she doesn't trust/believe me that it's 3 of the same sandwiches even though she's literally 10 feet away from the deli counter and has had nothing to do but watch this whole thing unfold. She proceeds to dump all of the sandwiches out of the bag and scan each individually\u200b as if to say I don't believe you dude and you're not getting any freebies from me. Again, no 'thanks/have a nice day' not even a 'go eff yourself...'\n\nI pay and hit the road wondering if perhaps there was a hostage situation in-progress in Arguello Market I just interrupted. Because failing that, I can think of no logical reason why I was treated with such neglect, mistrust, and contempt. I love to support the local grocery store but I am not planning to come back to Arguello anytime soon unless it's for an emergency. There are literally 5 or 6 other grocery stores within a five-minute\u200b drive. So just wow Arguello, get your act together.

Finally, I had to try it.\nHuge deli counter with lots of foodie choices, but I had my eye on that turkey sandwich. The place can get pretty busy (at the deli that is) and there was only 1 person greeting and making sandwiches, so it was about 15 min. before I could order mine. Only 4 people ahead of me.\nAll things considered, the turkey itself was moist and very flavorful. No fat, which was really nice. The sandwich consisted of both white and dark meat. I chose a sourdough bread instead of the dutch crunch (easier for me to eat). Min price for sandwich w/o anything extra is $7.99. I added cheese and cranberry, bringing the price to $9.99. \nThere is an abundance of turkey on the sandwich, but everything and I mean everything is piled in the middle, leaving the perimeter of the sandwich just bread. Because of this, I won't be returning. The price is a tad \"steep\" for me, but this seems to be the going rate these days.\nThough other markets make an equally good (if not better turkey sandwich) for about 2 bucks less. Oh and they too use fresh turkey.\nBut I had to try it.", "author": "Marla B."}

The device does not usually cause me any problems, but every once in a while I have a need to address an issue with the device. \n\nI stopped in here on Sunday, September 3 to grab a few groceries. I'd jumped off the 5-Fulton to do some shopping on my way home. I shop here every so often... or at least I used to. I would stop in quickly, grab a few things, and then catch the next bus down Fulton feeling good that I spent my money at a small business. Ha, so much for that.\n\nWhile in the store, I realized I had an issue with my pump that I knew I needed to deal with quickly. I asked to use their restroom so that I could figure out the problem (which required me to remove my top, so I needed a bit of privacy). I explained this to the female clerk, but she was not having it. She was rude, rude, RUDE! There was another customer that overheard the conversation and was like \"Are you seriously not going to let her use the bathroom?\". Nope, they were not.\n\nLike, this could turn into a medical emergency. But they could not care less. Like, I get it, we are in the city and public toilets are not a thing, but this is a life-sustaining device with an error. Would they rather have an ambulance come get me?  Yes, apparently they would. F*ckers.\n\nThe other customer was nice enough to jump into action, offered me a quick ride to the Safeway a few blocks away who DID let me use the bathroom to fix the tubing on my pump before the situation became critical (thank you Lydia!). We both grabbed what we needed from Safeway and went our separate ways.\n\nSo yeah. This store lost me as a customer and I will not ever be shopping there again.

Maybe it is because my dad used to make sandwiches using the pulled meat of a turkey or chicken, that this was not a wow, first time thing for me compared to others who typically only eat sliced turkey. Don't get me wrong, it's an adequate sandwich. I'd come back just because it is less than a block away from where I normally stay, but it would be more so out of convenience than the sandwich's taste.

I agree with all the more recent reviews here that said it was dry and kind of bland because that was how we felt about it too. The turkey did taste fresh, but most of the pieces were from the breast, and it just wasn't that moist, and I'm someone who loves turkey. The parts with dark meat were very nice however. In addition, the sandwich really needed something else in it to take it to the next level. The sandwiches we got only had turkey, lettuce, tomato, a smear of mayo, and two (yes, I counted) pickle slices. No cheese, no avocado, no bacon. The parts with pickle were great, but it needed a lot more than two tiny slices. I will give them credit, the sandwich was large and I was stuffed afterwards, but I could make a much better sandwich at home. I thought the price was fair for the size of the sandwich, but I probably wouldn't come back.

To be specific I am reviewing the market and not the deli. \n1. The turkey sandwhich with cranberries is DELICIOUS. I crave this sandwich sometimes and NEED to eat it. It is big, unique, and I am pretty sure it is made with love every time, by some beardy man. Thank you, beardy man!\n\nBut if I were to review the market, and offer any advice.  My advice is: plan ahead so that when you go to the normal grocery store: Safeway, trader Joes, or Costco, you buy everything you need at a reasonable price and do not have to come here for the ones offs, which are REALLY expensive. And those one offs add up. I would know.\n$10 for one filet of salmon\n$10 for  1lb ground coffee\n$10 for hot chocolate mix! :(\n$5 for almond milk...ok maybe that is normal, but you could by it on sale somewhere!\n\nMaybe other people are made out of money and don't mind paying the convenience premium, but I resent people like my boyfriend who keeps sending me on these one offs that at the end of the week have cost me $50.\n\nMr. Arguello Market, please do not throw me out of your store when you see me come in.\n\nP.S.

But they don't warn you ahead of time until at the register, you notice an additional $1.50 added to the price of the sandwich.  This is a long standing practice of this market.\n\nNow for the reason why I'm writing about it today.  As I was begrudgingly walking in to grab a drink, I overheard the manager confronting a already paid up customer sitting in front... mid bite into her sandwich, and interrogating her about whether or not her sandwich has cheese on it.  He then informs her, that she now owes an additional dollar for the cheese, which he failed to ring up in the first place.  WTF!! Your mistake, don't up charge customers after they have started eating!  \n\nAs I was shocked at that scene I went in and grabbed a couple items.  They added up to $4 bucks and some change.  I'm ready to pay and told $5 dollar minimum for using a card!  Ok, so you don't want my business?  Got it!  I haven't frequented or purchased a sandwich there in a very long time because they have so many extra costs on sandwiches, looks like I won't be frequenting the store anytime soon.  Good luck with continually offending customers.

Like Club Sandwich but classier?? Fiiiiiine, its lame. But it fits us so well). Club de Sandwich is on a mission to seek all sandwiches in SF (and some in South SF), and find the yummiest sandwich. I'll tell you right now - to date, anyone who's advertised their sandwich as \"the best\" or \"famous\" has disappointed me. Arguello disappointed me less than the others, but it does not deserve a \"world\" famous title. \n\nI got the turkey on dutch crunch. No extras (avocado and/or cheese), but with everything on it. Now, I must say it took me a while to eat it - I purchased it in the early afternoon intending to save it for dinner. I know, hot sandwiches would be best, but the taste should still hold up, ehh?\n\nThe sandwich...was decent. Just ok. The turkey was surprisingly moist, which is a plus. They give a thick slice of white and dark meat in the sandwich, which helps with the texture. The rest of \"everything' on it consisted of some lettuce, tomato, onions, and some sort of sauce. \n\nRemember kids, a sandwich should hold everything inside...which this one did for the most part. Except...my lettuce was prepared half-out of my sandwich. Like...literally. Imagine one piece of lettuce. Now...imagine half of it inside the sandwich, and the other half outside. I was confused...and opened my sandwich to cram it back inside. STAY IN DAG NABBIT!! Fail, sandwich maker. Please keep all ingredients fully in. You are allowed about half an inch to play around outside the bread, but this was too much.\n\nWorld Famous Turkey Sandwich, I release thee of thine title!!

This is my neighborhood grocery store, and for years my husband and I have observed how unfriendly the staff seems. Still, we went back. But today, it was their reaction to me when I brought back a product that was obviously stale that led me to write this review. \n\nI have a little ritual of grabbing a Justin's Peanut Butter Cup and eating one cup as I hike home with my daughter. Whether it's at the nearby Wholefoods or Arguello Super Market, I've had my share of these organic treats. So I feel qualified to say that when I bit into one today and there was no resemblance of peanut butter in the cup, I knew I had a faulty product. \n\nI walked back to Arguello and asked for a replacement rather than a refund. And, just in case the next one was faulty, I cracked a cup open while standing in the store, and it turns out that this one was \"off\" too. Not only did it taste chalky, the inside of the cup was dry and white rather than the color of peanut butter. \n\nWhen I brought this to the manager's attention, he pointed out the expiration date which is 2/19/14, and then questioned whether I've had them before, etc. The manager was abrasive, and he treated me as if I was a nuisance and insinuated that I had no idea what these peanut butter cups are supposed to taste like. \n\nThis is not how I wish to be treated by a place where I regularly spend money.  I want to support local business, but Arguello Super Market will not receive any more of my family's money.

I live around the corner and was really excited when we first moved to the neighborhood that we had a local grocery store & deli. I love mom & pop shops, and supporting small businesses. Unfortunately, the prices at Arguello are unbelievably inflated. Every time I do succumb to its proximal convenience I walk out stunned with how much I end up paying for a couple measly items. The service isn't that friendly, I thought after going there so many times the staff would begin recognizing me as a regular and acknowledging that. Nope, no homey, friendly, familial experience here. Actually, I think the cashiers at Safeway are friendlier on average. And the cherry on top: they often are out, or just do not carry many normal, standard, daily items that one would need. (And just a side note, the deli turkey sandwich is OKAY, but it's seriously overrated) So unless I'm *really* desperate I never go here, I just make the 5 block trek to Safeway.\n\nThere was one good experience I had here, that I do want to share, I was in desperate need of a razor, I picked up my usual razor and went to the cashier, the total was 21 dollars (which is insane) but i only had 18 dollars and i had left my wallet at home. I told the owner who was working as cashier, and he let me off with paying 18, but said I owed him $3 next time I came in, which was about a month later, but I reminded him (he had forgotten) and everything was square.", "author": "Shayan S."}

Their sandwiches are definitely worth a visit or two or three. In times as I'm segueing from class to work with barely enough time to grab a bite or looking for a quick and easy lunch for a day in the park, they always treat me right! And any place where your turkey sandwich is actually carved from a turkey roasting behind the counter with people able to request dark or light meat, is where you'll find me and that pretty much sums up the quality of the food you get here (high quality meats and fresh produce!)

I wouldn't mind the prices so much if it was your friendly little neighborhood grocer, but it's not. Every time I run in for a quick jug of milk, eggs, or a little treat for my kids, the manager, Roy, is nothing short of surly.  I almost always regret going in there, yet because of  convenience I found myself falling into it's trap over the years.\n\nI vow not to be seduced by it's close vicinity to my home ever again though. The last time I was there my 7yr old son accidentally  dropped a juice squeeze soda and it shattered on their floor before making it to the register. I apologized several times,and Roy just grumbled and went back and got the broom. I then went back and got another soda for my son, who looked all teary and kept saying sorry. I told him that everyone has accidents; that it's OK and we went  to the register. The girl just automatically swiped me for 3 sodas--without a word or explanation. She just took my money and I noticed after the fact, when I looked at my receipt, she charged me for the soda my little boy broke. I get it, you break it, you buy it, but really?? I mean at least they could have said something before they charged me. It was only a couple bucks, but an explanation that they have a certain shitty policy would be nice. I know it seems small, but after all these years of going there and paying their jacked prices, I can't t believe Arguello Market wouldn't eat one soda. The cashier-girl only shrugged and rolled her eyes a couple of times at me when I expressed that it was messed up. I asked Roy about it and he just scolded me. He said I need to watch my kid when he holds groceries. \n .\n I don't know, again, a couple bucks seems petty, but  my son has always picked his little drink from the back and carried it to the register with no accidents--he's been a reg there since he was three.

Maybe I had a sour look on my face that the guy behind the counter was responding to.  Maybe he made me a crappy sandwich cause i looked like a jerk.\n\nBut a bunch of sandwich ingredients piled haphazardly between two pieces of bread do not a sandwich make.  I appreciate the effort with the freshly-roasted turkey, but that's only pays off if it's less dry than the turkey my uncle makes; last Passover he put the bird BACK IN the oven because it wasn't dry enough for his taste.  \n\nHowever, you can still make a decent sandwich with dry turkey.  We've all done it.  Apparently Arguello Market hasn't.  \n\nWays to make a sandwich with dry turkey taste even worse, as demonstrated by AM:\n\n-make it on overly-thick slices of bread that drown out any of the other flavors\n-spread the mayonnaise so thin that you don't notice it's there\n-apply so little of the cranberry spread (that I paid extra for) that you don't notice its presence either\n-add too much lettuce, of which there should only be enough to add crisp texture, not so much that the wateriness washes away the remnants of taste left in your mouth\n-use underripe tomatoes.\n\nNow at least one of these issues has afflicted most every sandwich i've ever eaten that i didn't make for myself, most frequently the usage of underripe tomatoes.  But all of them in combination render nothing more than a dry (and thereby difficult and unpleasant to eat) and utterly crappy sandwich.  Add to that the fact that the guy working the deli counter was entirely unfriendly and the stupid thing costs something like $8.75.  AND you have to walk through the store in a roundabout way to pay at the register, a cheap gift store trick that encourages you to buy more things.\n\nSorry everybody, I just don't get it.  I'll stick to Roxie's\n\nTwo stars because I can't bear to give a small, local, non-chain market that puts pickles on its sandwiches one star.

I've moved away from this area since leaving school, but I will always come back here for the sandwiches.  Some of my friends lived less than a block from here, so picking up a sandwich before heading to their place was perfect.  Then they moved.  And I tried to find new friends in the area (well, not entirely true, but I still come back for the sandwiches).\n\nIt's a small grocery store, and may be a little pricey, but it's not a supermarket, so you have to know what to expect.  However, again, my point is that their deli is AWESOME.  Do yourself a favor, and try it.  I doubt you'll be disappointed if you like a good deli sandwich, and you can just walk to the park to enjoy it by the Conservatory of Flowers if you want to eat it outside.  I actually want one now.", "author": "Chris M."}

If you catch them at the right time, you can get first cut of a fresh turkey (this phenomenon is referred to as \"being in the zone\" and is rare).

But, today I came across this fine little establishment and couldn't help but review it out of pure enjoyment. \nAside from the grocery store, if you find yourself in the inner richmond district for whatever reason, and are craving a quick and tasty lunch, this is the place. Don't be fooled by it's appearance as a typical supermarket deli, as this far exceeds ANYTHING you could ever have the minimum wagers behind the counter at Lucky's or Safeway concoct for you. \nI ordered the Turkey Sandwich on Dutch Crunch in the \"Arguello box lunch.\" As you will see, they constantly have whole turkeys doing the 360 degree rotisserie dance on the rotisserie and that is the turkey they put in the sandwiches. As they were making my sandwich, I watched them freshly carve slices off of a whole turkey and slap them right down on the fresh slice of dutch crunch that would later become my sandwich. Along with the fresh condiments, the sandwich was truly amazing. In addition, in the Arguello box lunch deal, they give you an orange slice, an apple alice, an Oreo, and your choice of a variety of side salads. I chose the pesto pasta salad which was fresh and tasty with clearly thought out preparation. There were a number of other delicious looking pasta salads that I will most definitely test  on my assured future visits. Although I ate the entire meal in one sitting (in the quaint but convenient sitting area inside and outside of the supermarket), I could have easily stopped after the first half of the sandwich and still been satisfied with my level of fullness. So, needless to say, they give you a a lot of food.  Although it is a little pricey compared to a five dollar foot-long, I guarantee you the extra few bucks you spend are surely worth your time and effort....depending on how long it takes you to earn that money at your place of employment. \nDon't be fooled by this review and think that a turkey sandwich is all you can get because there are a TON of other items on the menu that I am sure are equally delectable.

They have just about everything you need, including a great cheese section...and plenty of wines to choose from as well. The best part about this place is the deli--the guys make THE BEST turkey sandwich in the city...any way you want it, I get half-and-half--dark and white meat--and everyone who works there is incredibly sweet! They're involved in the community and they care about you...love it!", "author": "Nicole S."}

So, I really wanted to love this place since its close by my place.  We ordered the #1 lunch box special which had their famous roasted turkey sandwich on dutch crunch bread, broccoli pasta salad, two orange slices, and a square oreo-type cookie.  We also picked up the #2 lunch box - italian meats sandwich on dutch crunch, pesto pasta salad, etc....They came to $8.95 a piece.  The roasted turkey was allright.  I have to admit the dutch crunch bread was delicious and not at all the tough stuff that scrapes the roof of your mouth.  I'd say overall, it was \"eh\", but may go back to try it with ...dark meat and cranberry sauce", "author": "Jen C."}

Prices are through the roof.  If you're on a budget shopping here will help you lose weight.  Its next door from my house but unless I'm in a hurry its always worth walking 7 blocks to Safeway to pay 40% less for the same items.", "author": "Charles K."}

I read the other reviews and its funny how some people write some reviews about how the sandwiches are over rated. FUCK its just a sandwich people. Do you expect it to tap dance in front of you for an hour before you eat it? Damn! Overpriced? Geez I would hate to go to some of the ghetto ass places some of these reviewers go. Its not that over priced, the sandwiches are good and Sal does take care of his employees you shit talking queens that have nothing better to do but bash other people... These reviews are about the business and customer service not to personally attack the owners that has nothing to do with your experience at this place.", "author": "T S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-11", "description": "They have by far the greatest sandwiches in the city! No shredded lettuce, eww! Which is such an indicator for cheap and bad sandwiches-- shredded iceberg is watered down, has no nutritional value and they bleach for zeus' sake! They use Boars' Head deli meat, which is excellent quality and tasty, and they use fresh toppings. I always order the perfect sandwich: turkey on sourdough with mayo, swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, and you need their special trick SALT & PEPPER. I don't know what it is about the addition of salt and pepper but it makes it fabulous. You don't taste the grittyness of these additions but it gives it a subtle hint of flavor. \n\nPersonal Experience: (Feel free to overlook this if you don't want to read my quick bitching)\n\nOne caution though.. I used to order in the market and sometimes wait in the long line around lunch and I always felt pressured to rush. I hated being that annoying customer with a custom sandwich but I such a sandwich snob I physically need it that way. So to avoid this I thought, I'll just phone in my order so I don't have to be annoying in person and I don't have to wait in line. BAD IDEA. I've done this the last two times and they completely messed up my orders! Even when they read it back to me! Then they acted like I ordered something else that I didn't! The first time it happened I was soooooo pissed I thought I was going to cry they made me a turkey sandwich with NO MAYO, only cranberries and lettuce.. UH?? what the hell? It was so upsetting that the next time I tried the phone order way, I checked my sandwiches once I left and they messed up again, not as bad as the the first. I went back to have them correct it and I think the boss/manager/owner has issues with the sandwich dudes and they secretly hate each other because they started fighting and I felt really bad. So a word of advice, just order there because even when speaking slowly on the phone they mess it up!", "author": "Diego S."}

Oh and the dutch crunch rolls they had always were nice and fresh and they never skimped on the tomatoes or avocados when I ordered with them. Cheers!\n\nA plus is that the owner is very nice like a previous review mentioned. Dad and him were friends and all that neighborhoodly jazz so he always asked about school and stuff. Nice dude.", "author": "Nana n."}

The deli roast turkeys every single morning so they are perfect and nice and hot for lunch!  I recommend getting it on Dutch crunch bread with cranberry.

I know everyone loves the famous turkey sandwich, but as a vegetarian, I love their veggie.  Lots of avocado and cheese and fresh veggies.  Call in ahead of time during the weekday lunch rush so you don't have to wait in line.  Sal, the owner, and the guys behind the deli counter are super nice and remember your name.  A great neighborhood place.  I got my two co-workers addicted to the turkey sandwiches and we used to come here 3x/week.  The sandwiches have gone up in price in recent years, but it's worth it.", "author": "Annie L."}

A good sandwich, slightly overpriced but conveniently located groceries, decent beer and wine selection.  I'll keep coming here as long as I live in the neighborhood.", "author": "Julie H."}

The meat is cut from a whole turkey that is on  a roaster.  You need to specify white or dark meat, or they will give you dark. It is really a treat.  They taste like the day after Thanksgiving.  I am going to give them 5 stars for the turkey sandwich only.  I can't judge the rest of the market.", "author": "Susan W."}
