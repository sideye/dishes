Side note, I brought 4 others who were all first timers and were really excited after I told them about it. Now, I used to dine here frequently from 2011-2013 and by frequently I mean twice per week. Why? I was always happy with their quality of food, service, and price point. I came so often that walking through their front door always gave me such a warm feeling of nostalgia.\nToday's food was still good (would have been a 1 star review if not for the food). However, service was just HORRENDOUS. We arrived just shortly after 9pm, like 5 minutes past. We were a group of 6 and there were only 2 other parties dining. We took about 5-10 minutes to decide what to order. That gave us 45 mins still to enjoy our food and pay before they close at 10pm. Our food came out quickly, but the server was very pushy trying to rush us to finish and leave. Soon doobu is a quick meal, it definitely wouldn't have taken us 45 mins to finish. Not only was there this awkward tension in the air, but she even limited our banchan refills!!!! They give 5 different types of banchan in a small dish. After our second time asking for a refill of banchan, she said \"you guys already had 2 refills\". Now remember, we were a table of 6. The size of those banchan dishes only gave 1 small bite per person. If anything, we had a party of 6 who ordered 6 separate meals and should be allowed 5 refills because logically if we all sat separately we would have each had our own set of banchan. We still tipped despite everything, but I just felt so disappointed and cheated of our money.\nI felt guilty for recommending Doobu to my friends. \nThis experience just left a very sour taste in all of our mouths. I had some great memories and amazing meals in the past. And now, they will only remain a thing of the past. You won't be seeing any of us dining here again. Next time, the short drive to Tofu House will be well worth it.\nIt's just not what it used to be. Bring back the old Doobu I so fondly remember!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Sometimes the bad reviews are based on poor service, which c'mon is what you normally expect with Asian spots...

To me, I should've waited in line at the surrounding restaurants as there was a reason this place was empty.\n\nTable of three we all ordered soondubu at medium spicy. At $11.95 a bowl, it was glorified flavored water for broth with no heat whatsoever. Staff brought out a lot of spice flavors for us to add to our bowls which helped but it wasn't a positively memorable dish. \n\nBanchan was pretty lackluster as well.

It seriously tasted like water that was barely flavored. I usually opt for mild, and even went medium today, thinking I could use a kick. Unfortunately, there was none. At all. In addition to the soup, the purple rice was slightly undercooked. I like my rice pebbled, but the rice tonight was just too hard. And no, it wasn't bc it was purple rice and it tastes that way. It shouldn't be that hard. \n\nAnywho, the banchans were meh. Nothing spectacular. Nothing disgusting. The rice tea was good. The service was alright. All in all, would I come back again?

I often come here whenever I have a specific craving as it's pretty accessible in Japantown. Food gets a 3.5 from me, given the attentive service and good prices for the stews.\n\nMenu items range from all different kinds of tofu stews and standard Korean dishes such as bibimbap, galbi, etc. In my opinion the best deal is the tofu stew as they'll run you about $12 and are significantly cheaper than the other menu items which start around $15-20+. I don't see why this restaurant doesn't just narrow down their offering as there are a surprising amount of different kinds of stews you can choose from, such as dumpling, seafood, corned beef, etc. It's easy to find something that will satisfy most peoples needs.\n\nNote that the spicy levels are pretty mild, so if you're really into spiciness, ask for the maximum. From what people tell me, medium spicy just makes the dish flavorful.\n\nFood came out pretty quickly for us, and the restaurant never seems too busy during the afternoon so it's easy to walk in. I love that the waiters offer spacious seating in the booths even if you're only coming with 1-2 other people.\n\nVegetable Tofu Stew - Comes with a good amount of fresh banchan, purple rice and an egg.

The menu consists of typical Korean food: tofu soups, bibimbaps, and meats. I ordered a kimchi tofu soup with beef (mild, since I can't handle the spiciness that well). They gave us banchan as well, which consisted of fish cake, pickled radish and carrots, some leafy greens, kimchi, and some root veggie that I'm not quite sure what it was. I wish they gave us more variety of banchan, but that depends on the restaurant so I was a little disappointed in that. The food came out quickly, and the spiciness level of the tofu soup was just right. My friend ordered hers to be extra spicy, and she said it wasn't that spicy, but maybe she has a high tolerance for spiciness. The soup was delicious, though there was more tofu that soup, making it kinda like a lumpy mush and less like soup, but it was still delicious nonetheless. The only main downside was the lighting, it was kinda dark in the restaurant, I'm not sure if it was the color the walls were painted or if it was the lighting, but it was kind of dim and dark.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-15", "description": "Doobu is located in the middle of Japantown, which is a little ironic, but cutely quaint. Seating is mostly booth, but there are a few tables as well. When I went with a friend on a weekday for lunch, there was a decent stream of customers but only one waitress. She was super chipper and energetic though, running around to all the tables and keeping up quite nicely with the lunch rush. \n\nThey have a lunch special selection as well as a regular dinner menu, and we ordered one item from each to try it out. The regular dinner menu comes with side dishes in the little platters, while the lunch special comes in a bento box with fewer side dishes already planned into the bento.\n\nSide dishes:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#3odl1vIAIbx4JDNRG1IfEg)\nThe side dishes were pretty standard, with pickled seaweed, marinated bean sprouts, sliced fish cake, kimchi, and pickled radish slivers. There was also a fried yellow croaker (I believe?), which was a nice addition. I thought the kimchi was a little lackluster compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to, but I liked the pickled seaweed because of its acidity. The fried fish was okay, a little cold and not crunchy anymore since it'd been sitting around for a bit after being fried. \n\nSeafood soft tofu soup (mild):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#fKy9pVB7RjjSDNNGjw86Zw)\nThis soft tofu soup wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. It's hard for any soft tofu to measure up to SGD Tofu House, but there was a generous amount of seafood in this. There were small shrimp, clams, and oysters. The flavor was just mediocre though, maybe a little bland.\n\nPurple rice:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#j7X3LZIXSIyxJOOgQaADRg)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#a-q80BNeQSqvtaloEKA0Og)\nI appreciated that the rice came with a lid to keep it warm, but the kernels were a little hard in my opinion. I love the purple rice that's a signature of Korean restaurants, and I always look forward to the contrast of the softer kernels of white rice and the crunchier texture of the purple. I didn't really get that here.\n\nCombination soft tofu soup (lunch special portion):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#PiP0dNxCy774spxmT1-r4g)\nThe lunch special came with a bowl of combination soft tofu soup, medium spiciness. The level of spiciness cannot be altered because they premake it, and I did not notice any seafood or beef within the soup despite it being listed as combination. The flavor was similar to that of seafood soft tofu soup, not unpleasant, but a little bland. The spiciness had a kick to it, but it wasn't unbearable. \n\nGalbi (lunch special portion):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#X77erU_M0KGo-inviLx-sw)\nThis was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. I got the lunch special with galbi, marinated beef short ribs. The marinade was pretty good, although a little too sweet. The grill on the ribs was good, and the meat was chewy yet tender. The pieces were a bit on the fatty side though, especially near the bone.\n\nOverall, this place wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd return specifically. Nothing really stood out, and while prices weren't unreasonable, I think there's better fare out there at similar pricing.", "author": "Maggie X."}

Doobu is located in the middle of the alley in this part of Buchanan. \n-Medium sized restaurant; they have plenty of booths and table space.

I always go for the combination since it gives you the best of everything: beef, shrimp, oyster, clam! \n-If you're looking for spicy, get the highest level - SPICY. I browsed a few reviews before ordering and good thing because several people noted that their mild spice level soups weren't that spicy. My soup was really red but it hit the spot.

Our appetizers were sitting on the counter for quite a while and the waitress chose to make us wait. The appetizer size has gone a lot smaller and No more fried fish! The tea tasted like they mistakenly used a coffee pot to make hot tea. During the whole dinner, the server didn't even bother to swing by to check on us. Of course, she had too much to do.

Although it was $10 per lunch box, it didn't really worth that price. Kimchi I mentioned earlier, only 1 type of kimchi (1 tbs). The salad was so oily, not sure what sauce they put in.

We cracked eggs in our stews and stirred them around a little so the bottom didn't burn. One thing I love about this dish is that is stays consistently hot throughout. I like to take a little rice in my spoon and let it soak up some of the rich, spicy broth. \n\nAt around $11 per soup, I think this dish is well worth it.

We were served up less than a handful of banchan (4 to be exact) and fried fish was nowhere to be found.  Sad face.   \n\nAmusing though was the whole, in-shell egg which arrived on my table simultaneously with said banchan and without explanation.  Bless the lord, my friend knew what this was for.  Left to my own devices I'd have taken it as more banchan, cracked it open, and had a yolky, viscous mess on my hands.  And table.  \n\nThough never explained, the egg was there for us to crack open and lay atop the bubbling hot, spiced-to-order tofu soup of which Doobu has many versions.  I sampled the one with shrimp, prepared to \"medium\" spiciness, as specified.  'Twas a good tofu soup, not remarkable, but one I'd happily have again were I in the area.  I'd never before seen the \"cook an egg on top\" thing and didn't really think it was necessary or that it added much but it's a cute idea.  \n\nThe bibimbap was also solid: full of many tasty cooked vegetables, well-flavored, and had the required crisp rice sticking to the scalding hot stone pot.  \n\nOn a Saturday evening when so many other places in the area had hour plus waits, I was able to waltz (yes, I waltzed) right into Doobu and, after waiting for the clearing of a tabletop, sit right down.  Sometimes you just want to sit down and eat a meal not stand around and wait to sit down and eat that meal.  That this can be accomplished at Doobu is a good thing.\n\nThe place isn't fancy and neither is the service.  It's perfunctory and gets the job done.

So yummy!\nI had the beef dumpling tofu soup, medium spicy. My hubby had the ramen tofu soup. They are both served with side dishes of kimchi (banchan). Also both came with an egg that you just plop on top of the soup, and it cooks. Both soups were soo soo good! Loved the taste. And just the right amount of spicy kick. The hubs thought medium was too spicy so if you're not into spicy try the lower levels. \n\nAn interesting thing is the fried whole fish they give you at the beginning of the meal. It's complimentary, I guess their version of chips and salsa LOL. This is prob traditional Korean? I think it is dried fish that is fried? Not too sure but be careful eating it, quite boney. Also, the tofu soups are really hot in temperature because of the pot it comes in. It remains hot for a long time. I mean, I could feel the hot tofu go down my esophagus.

Doobu Tofu closes at 9:30 PM on Sundays, and as most restaurants are very accommodating to folks who are already dining in I've always had this quirk where I just feel bad about staying past the closing time at any restaurant.  I sat down inside the restaurant at 9:05 PM.  After a quick glance of the menu I was ready.  The waitress took my food and drink order immediately.\n\nAt 9:10 PM I had several plates of banchan, a whole fried fish and a raw egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WyBN8MGM6LVuDNBD4cBEqA?select=90y2c9jVK14IegWZsCPqZA) in front of me.  I loved the fried fish and appreciated that the bones were easy to locate and remove.  The glass noodles and the bean curd strips were probably my favorites, but I enjoyed all of the banchan dishes.\n\nMy Shrimp Soon Tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WyBN8MGM6LVuDNBD4cBEqA?select=QCh9co8rl3jPrCSuwtlMHw) arrived around 9:13 PM.  This was my first experience with Korean tofu soup.  I ordered it mild and the spicyness was pretty mild, but I loved this.  It was served in a miniature stone pot so as much as I wanted it to cool down fast so I could just guzzle it I just couldn't because it stayed hot throughout my meal.  I loved the big blocks of soft tofu and the soup had lots of little head attached, soft shelled shrimp.  I wasn't sure if my system could digest the shrimp heads and legs otherwise I might've eaten them whole.  It was kind of a chore removing what little meat was in those little shrimp.  The broth was very flavorful even though I forgot to crack the raw egg into it.\n\nImmediately after the Soon Tofu arrived I got the Bulgogi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WyBN8MGM6LVuDNBD4cBEqA?select=lAMGCrTrpzap76DK-eVjdA) served on a stone platter and a bowl of rice.  I forgot to ask the waitress, but the rice was very interesting.  It had a purple-like hue to it, but it tasted fine.  The Bulgogi was delicious.  The beef was shaved thin and cooked very tender.  The vegetables, mainly onions, peppers, zucchini and carrots, were also cooked tender but not soft.  I had no problem finishing everything except for the raw egg.\n\nIn my eating flurry the waitress did stop by to check up on me, and when she started to clean up different areas of the restaurant I picked up the pace.  By 9:30 PM I was full and happy.  The waitress brought me my check.  I paid it and left a nice tip, and rolled out of the restaurant at 9:35 PM.  Doobu Tofu was awesome for a quick dinner, and I will be back!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-23", "description": "Doobu is decent Korean food for SF, but certainly not the best ever (tastier/cheaper options in Palo Alto, Cupertino, LA). \n\nAlthough, I still keep coming back here because....\n1) Accessibility. I live in the neighborhood, so it's easy for me to come here for lunch or order to-go for dinner. There's rarely a wait. \n2) Their bibimbap is large in size and fills you up. \n3) Service is quick. Whether you're eating in or taking out, you can order and get your food within 10 minutes. \n4) They serve the traditional purple Korean rice -- believe it or not, this is actually hard to find in many Korean restaurants in the Bay. (purple, grainy rice tastier than white rice, IMO). \n\nWhy I DON'T like Doobu: \n1) The prices are ridiculous for Korean food. $14 for a Bibimbap? Commercial rent must be really expensive in this part of Japantown. \n2) Also, for the high prices, you get about half as much side dishes than at your typical Korean restaurant. Higher prices for less value. \n3) They serve you the side dishes at the same time you get your entree, not before to eat as an appetizer. Again, this deviates from your typical Korean restaurant. \n4) Service: Everyone always looks bored and not interested to help you out. However, this doesn't bother me that much; it's pretty standard when dining at Asian establishments in general. \n\nLastly, I read another reviewer's complaint about a cockroach that crawled across the surface of his table... I will say I have NOT experienced this myself, the restaurant has been pretty clean the couple times I've been at Doobu.

Third, they gave us check to rush us out while we were still eating and there were literally NO ONE in the restaurant but us. Moreover, THEY CHARGE TIPS BEFORE WE EVEN GOT THE RECEIPT TO WRITE TIPS AND TOTAL ON. The check was our meal price plus tax and we gave our card without any doubt. And when we got our card and the receipt back, we were charged 18% of tips ALREADY! Like really???? I'm never coming again.", "author": "Jennt C."}

I would say the tofu soup I had was about 3.5 stars but I rounded up since I liked their attentive service.  I had the mushroom tofu soup...Mmm...enoki!  After you get over the initial spoonful of mushroom flavor that may come off a little strong, your taste buds get acclimated and it's all good.  The soup is served with purple rice.  The appetizer is a fried fish that was pretty good.  I think we had 4 banchans, ie kimchi, seaweed, fishcake, pickled daikon and carrots (? not completely certain on this last one).  My favorite of the lot was seaweed.  My favorite banchan, that weren't served, are jae chae and the fried potato with sticky sauce.  I wish more restaurants offered them.", "author": "Melinda Y."}

The tofu they use is so silky and just works with the soup, no matter what flavor you get. My favorite is mushroom. A likes the beef. You get the egg on the side, and stir it in when it comes--SO GOOD! They used to give you a little fried fish as an appetizer, but appear to have stopped.

A person I met a t the cafe recommended Doobu and I was always curious what the food was like inside after passing by so many times. \n\n\nThe first time I came here I ordered the Combination soon do bu (seafood+beef+vegetables etc.) and Seafood Bibimbap.

That alone is the reason I had to come back the next day.lol  There was the right amount of crisp texture you can feel when taking the bite of the seafood and rice combination and the taste had the right amount of sesame oil and chili paste. I wish I could make this dish like them. \n\nOther then the seafood bibimbap nothing really surprised me here. Prices are about the same like any other tofu house so is the taste.

Well, I'm 1st generation Korean, my mom was in town to help me pack and I wanted something to soothe my sore throat. And because this is the food of my motherland, this review is kinda long. As a Korean I feel compelled to give some credible review so all of you non's know what's up.\n\nThat said, I may be 1st generation but I'm no Korean food conoisseur so I grilled my mom on her opinions for this Yelp review. I think she was a little perplexed as to why I suddenly cared so much about Korean food tonight. (It's not my favorite cuisine. There. I said it.)\n\nDue to the proximity of J-town to my current abode we walked over there and checked out Seoul Garden's menu. Mom's reaction to the prices: \"Are you fucking kidding me???\" Actually she was a bit more demure than that and it was also in Korean, but it was the Mama Han equivalent to Hell to the Motherfucking No. So we wandered across the street and Doobu caught my eye.\n\nStarter: A whole fried fish. I've never had this before at a Korean restaurant, but ok, cool. I'm down with some complimentary food. Except it was a whole fried fish that kept LOOKING AT ME and I wasn't keen on picking out the bones. Yes, I had my mom do it. It was... meh. It's pretty much just salted fish that's been fried in some batter.\n\nBanchan (the little side dishes that always come with a Korean meal): Mom says, \"That's it? They give you so much more in the East Bay.\" The cucumber kimchi and cabbage kimchi were a bit too marinated and had been \"sitting too long\" for my taste. It's hard to explain but you can serve kimchi too soon before it's ready, this was on the other end of the spectrum. The portions of the other three (bean sprouts, fish cake and spinach) were small. Sadness.\n\nSpicy Seafood Doobu (Spicy, tofu, seafood. Exactly what the name says): Yay it was actually spicy! Mom said it was not bad, but then she also informed me that it had MSG. \"How do you know?\" \"You can just tell.\" \"But how do you KNOW?? Can you taste it??\" (I'm totally thinking my mom has some weird superpower to detect MSG in food.) \"Look it's thick and if you made this at home, you'd never add it so it wouldn't look quite like this. And most restaurants just DO.\" (Superhero Mom fantasy deflated.)\n\nBeef bibimbap (beef mixed with rice, egg, and other veggies in a hot stone bowl): This was inneresting. Instead of using bulgogi that typically comes in this dish, ground beef is used and marinated in the same stuff as bulgogi. There was quite a lot of meat and not as much veggies as I'm used to. It was not bad, just different from what I'm used to for bibimbap. Mama Han says, \"This is ok, just different. But that's a small portion for $12. I could make this way better.\" Bitchslap, Doobu. And yes, my mom's cooking is the shit.\n\nRandom: They played Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You\". Made me misty-eyed for the 90's and middle school dances.\n\nMama Han's conclusion: For better Korean food go to the South Bay.\n\nMy conclusion: For the best Korean food have mom's home cooking. \n\n(If I had gone by myself and I didn't know any better this would've been a 3-star review, but tonight I'm putting myself in my mom's size 6 shoes.

Doobu also used to have way cooler and a wider variety of side dishes, but I get it, the times are tough and you can't be giving away food for free. At least all my favorites are still there (bean sprouts, kimchi). \n\nPrice: Coming form Los Angeles where the restaurant market is much tougher, prices are much friendlier.

Every single time we get food.  Poor guy.\n\nIt is very rare that I get a craving for Korean food up here in San Francisco.  I've mentioned before that the best Korean food is back down in LA, and since I go there once every few months, I get my fill.  However, I really wanted either a bibimbap or kimchee fried rice, and that craving was beating up the ramen craving that I had right before I parked in Japantown.\n\nSo, we ended up at Doobu after I remembered a few recent 4-star reviews from fellow Yelpers Wilhelm Y. and Mike L.  Good sign.  Plus, the other Korean restaurant on Post had only 4 people inside, and they weren't Asian.  You win, Doobu.\n\nThere were a few other groups in the restaurant (note, this place is not good for parties of more than 4), and there was one booth left.  We sat, and the waitress, a very nice Korean girl, brought us our menus.  I decided on the beef bibimbap (they didn't have kimchee fried rice) and Boyfriend had the spicy pork, which came with rice.\n\nThe small plates that came out before the meal were hit or miss.  The fried fish (my FAVORITE), seaweed salad and the fishcakes were good.  The others (soybean sprouts, kimchi, some other pickled cabbage) lacked flavor in general.  The waitress accidentally gave us another egg, and we were confused until she brought out our orders and took the egg back.  Who does that?  I could've used an extra egg!\n\nMy bibimbap was in a smaller pot (and more expensive) than the ones I've had in LA or elsewhere, but the stone pot was super hot and kept the rice, beef and veggies piping hot throughout the entire time I was eating.  I liked that the beef wasn't marinated sweet like in others that I've had, but I didn't like how they just cracked the egg into the bowl and didn't fry it first before putting it in.  I know it cooks rapidly because it's so hot, but I'd rather just break up the already-fried egg myself so my chopsticks don't dig into the raw egg yolk.\n\nBoyfriend didn't really enjoy his spicy pork because he said it wasn't enough meat, too many veggies and it wasn't spicy.  I didn't try any because I don't like pork (except bacon and ham), but the meat itself didn't look bad.\n\nWhen I was almost done with my meal, I looked up on the wall and saw a few small flies posting up on the artwork.  It might've been from the heat wave that we had, but ..it kind of killed my desire to finish eating (I ate the whole bowl anyway).  I'm just glad I saw that after I finished eating, not before.  Hopefully this isn't a recurring problem?\n\nBoyfriend gave this place 3 stars, I gave it 3.5 because of the flies and decent food.

Sure... I guess. \n\nI mean, the tofu all came out fairly fast but her beef bibimbap shouldn't have taken so long or even forgotten.. I guess we waited too long to wave down a server but still..

Well, maybe not LOVE since it seems that my favorite waitress is gone now, but it's still pretty damn good!  Not quite on the level of My Tofu House for me taste wise, but you can't beat the lack of a serious wait.  Been here a number of times now, and I think we only had to wait for a table twice, and neither of those times was the wait longer than 5-10 mins.  The servers are all really friendly, and are certainly hard workers.  Typically there are only two working on shift, so while things can slow down from time to time, it's hard to blame them when there's a full house.\n\nTheir soon doobu (tofu soup) tastes pretty good, but has a thinner consistency than My Tofu House.  There's some definite kick as you move up the spiciness scale, so those with a weak stomach have been warned.  There's plenty of good stuff loaded in, but not too much of any one thing, so plus points on the balance there.  Also, the variety of soups is pretty decent, ranging from the usual suspects to more unique ones like ham and cheese and corned beef.\n\nOne tweak compared to most tofu soup places is that you get a bowl of purple-ish rice...some sort of red bean or taro rice?  Either way, it's better than the usual white rice just for something different.  Their Haemul Pajun (Seafood Pancake) is not bad...about average to what I've had and a decent amount of fillings with a good dipping sauce.  If anything, maybe a little doughy for my taste, but I know one of my friends likes it that way so that's more of a personal thing.  As for the meat plates...holding comment for now.  The first and only time we got something, we felt it was a little light on meat and heavy on onion compared to the neighboring table.

My friend and I could walk around Japantown while comparing the prices to this restaurant. We finally caved and went in. The place was pretty empty, but it was around 3:30pm-4:00pm, so it's understandable. We waited to be seated, even though there weren't many customers. It took maybe 30 seconds before a waiter helped us to our seat--not bad. The waitress was fairly nice, but seemed to be rushing all the time. I didn't see a reason for her to rush considering there were maybe two other small parties eating. She was able to take our orders when we were ready, and refilled our glasses promptly, without us asking. \n\nThere wasn't much variety to the food--alot of the basic stuff: kalbi, donaksum spicy tofu stew. The food came pretty quickly. We also got appetizers, which were fried fish. It was decent, my friend really liked it because it was what her mom cooked for her in China. I thought it was ok, but it was cold! If you give an appetizer it should at least be warm, i don't really care if you microwave it. As long as it's warm when it gets to me. The bibimbap was fine also. I've eaten bibimbap form many different restaurants, and this one didn't really meet the standards of the others. For reference, I got the beef bibimbap.

We ordered one soup to share and order with extra rice along with the side dishes. I was excited for dish to come out coz of the fish. Since it's always good and crunchy on the outside. As my friend, she just does like having clam for soup choice. Anyways, when our meal arrived, I go on eating the fish again but when I taste it. It doesn't taste right as my friend trying her clam soup. Hers went wrong as well but we still decided to continue to finish it so we could ASAP. Since its the same server that we encounter before that chase customers for tips.\n\nAnyways, i cannot really rant much of why it's not good, sorry to keep it sealed. All i know is, they need to improve their customer service. \n1. As a server, always a good idea to check the soup if it's good to go or not before serving to customers. Not just handling to them because that's not a way to do it as a server. Why? It regards to customer satisfaction, If wanted bonus(extra tips).\n2. It's better to get certain side dishes last after getting the soup. So it will still taste right not just sat at an area that will get cold soon while waiting for soup.\n\n+3 stars\nLike I said before in one of my paragraphs, about cannot rant much and it brings great memory.

Yes, a Korean restaurant in Japantown is the best place to eat...well, there's also Playground (another Korean place), but I think of Playground more as a nighttime kind of place. I don't think Playground is even open during the daytime (I'll have to check on that after I write this update).\n\nAnyway, despite the somewhat limited menu in comparison to Playground, Doobu tops out for the versatility and the lunch special. For 7.95, you get a choice of meat ($1 extra for Kalbi), tofu soup, 3 side dishes, a bowl of rice, a salad, and a yogurt drink. It's a pretty hefty platter; usually I don't go for lunches over $5, but this one was a true exception. Plus, as I already said, the plate is hefty, so it's well worth the money.\n\nIf you miss out on the lunch special (11am to 3pm M-F only), that's okay. The rest of the menu is still great; prices are average for Korean establishments ($10 for most of the tofu soup, $15 or so for the other dishes). Extra kudos for the variety in bibimpap and the combinations (tofu soup + meat). They're very generous with the banchan as well, and, if dining with a friend or two, you'll each get a fried fish to nibble on.\n\nService is prompt and friendly; decor is chic and modern.

I noticed you get short changed on the little plates if you seem (or look) like you're unfamiliar with Korean food.

The stone bowl piping hot, and luckily we were distracted by our delicious, yet not as spicy as I would've liked, tofu soup (with oysters), that we left the bibimbap crisping and crunching. \n\nThat's the trick, don't touch it straight away. Let the bowl sit for a while, dress the dish with spicy sauce (you have to ask for it), and mix, mix, mix. Your eyes will roll to the back of your head as the crunchy bits of rice, beef, sauce and egg (yes, don't skip that egg!) amalgamate into a bibimbap orgasm. *sigh* That hot bowl is my new boyfriend!\n\nLoved: said dish, decor, cleanliness, service, fair prices.\n\nDid not love so much: kitchen needs to deliver spicy when I say spicy, wish the tofu soup was a bit larger", "author": "Antoi C."}

This is the second place I've gone in SF for soondubu and I can definitely say that in terms of the actual soondubu, it's as good as the places I usually go in south bay.  Flavorful soup, good variety of mushrooms, plentiful tofu and well cooked so that all the ingredients meld together into a single dish (sometimes the mushrooms aren't cooked together long enough so that the enoki, for example, is still one big clump).\n\nIn terms of the rice, can be improved.  They were going for purple rice but barely had any purple grains, so the rice came out to be neither white nor truly multi-grain.  Also served in a steel bowl rather than a hot stone (my preference).\n\nThe barley tea can also be improved - lukewarm at best and more water than tea.\n\nThe side dishes were all delicious, albeit a little small in portion.  I think you can request refills but we didn't bother.\n\nOverall, satisfied my craving for hot soup + tofu on a foggy night!", "author": "Judy L."}

They had the typical kimchi and bean sprouts, but the other three were more unusual, and they were my fav.  Seaweed, some sort of marinated cabbage and cucumbers, and the best, strips of what i'm told were fish...maybe tofu...hard to say.  But those were good.

One waitress, a dozen tables, and she even did that trick where you do the same activity (taking order, giving checks, etc) to many tables in a row for extra points.  She would not have made expert this level.\n\nWe stood awkwardly in front of the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign for about 10-15 minutes until the busboy took pity on us and seated us before returning to the kitchen.\n\nAbout five minutes later, we got some water and the waitress took our order.  We both ordered a combo, I got the combination soon tofu and he the mushroom soon tofu, both with bulgogi.\n\nThe small appetizers were tasty and refreshing.  I especially liked the seaweed and the fried tofu strips.  \n\nThe soon tofu was HOT.  I cracked the egg into mine and then waited a bit for everything to cool down.  I knew I had to work slowly because my water glass was never going to get refilled (I'm more stating a fact here than complaining).  The bulgogi was very tender, exactly what I wanted.  And not quite as hot as the soon tofu.  I highly recommend the combination soon tofu, with strips of beef, whole shrimp, clams and oysters (about two each of the seafood bits).  I knew I was burning my mouth but it tasted so good I kept going.\n\nThe tofu+bbq combination is a lot of food, and I was very sad when I got home and realized I forgot the leftovers on the table...:-(", "author": "Cathy Y."}

And your choice of meat. Pork, Beef, or Chicken. I always get the Galbi with the oyster tofu soup. YUM. You also get a starter of fresh fried fish and of course the standard side dishes.

Your mouth just gets hotter, retains the heat longer, and it takes forever and a day to finish delicious things like BiBimBop.\n\nI think I've gotten fed up with it. I finally took it out. Ask me why? It's so I can eat hot food quicker, speak with more diction, and I just got plain tired of burning my mouth. \n\nYes, it took me over 10 years to make that decision. I'm smart, but indecisive, and it takes me a while to make a \"major\" decision. \n\nDoobu is worth burning your tongue over. Or you could be like me and numb the sizzling sensation of your mouth's roof  with something cold like sake. That's a brilliant combo. Screw milk, give me the sake.\n\nThe green onion pancake is killer and not as oily as the other pancakes I've had at similar establishments throughout the city. The sauces were flavorful, and we drenched the pancake in the amuse bouches that Doobu serves up, keeping it's classic lines. \n\nBiBimBop, sizzing with amazing tofu, veggies, and kimchi. I don't think I can get it any better than that. I'll eat kimchi until I get a sour stomach and can't handle it anymore.I love the crispy little pieces of rice with egg stuck on the corners of the hot pot. Those crispy corners are worth taking your tongue bar out for, but you still may need the sake like me. \n\nWe went early, and were the only people sitting down to eat, but I just didn't want to deal with the business of the crowd and the noise. They feed you quickly at Doobu, so just be prepared with some sort of mouth cooling device, otherwise  you'll feel it for the next two days, and everything will taste like cardboard from a burned mouth, or like me a singed tongue.", "author": "Danielle S."}

Aside from the tofu being good, even their appetizer is amazing! A little fish deep fried to perfection, only when you eat it once you get it though. The entire fish is edible, because having been fried, the bones are soft and will not cause you any problems if you decide to wolf that down as well. \n\nDuring dinner time, the must get is the chicken teriyaki and tofu soup combo. I strongly recommend either their corn beef or ham and cheese soup, both of which are amazing.

As our ordered entries started to come, we were floored by all of the extras that a dish came with... which was not listed on the menu at all. Fried fish, and a large selection of small dishes flanked our main course. We were starving, so were very grateful for the large portions as we sang them praise back and forth.\n\nSadly, once our hunger started to be sated, we noted that some of the food could have been better as the praise started to diminish. We ordered a steak dish, but really it was almost more of a ground beef and quite greasy as well. The fried fish was also not too great either.\n\nWhat was amazing was the tofu, though. Although listed as \"Doobu\" here, most of the menu seemed to mention the place as \"Doobu Tofu\" and its easy to see why. We hadn't been a fan of tofu prior, but upon trying their extremely good fried tofu salad we have grown a new leaf and will probably be trying more tofu in the future.\n\nSo in the end, come for the tofu... but stay away from the meat, at least from what we tried and came to the conclusion of on a less hungry stomach.

I was not happy being that the difference she demanded from me was only about $4 extra. After that I didn't want to tip her at all, and told her about the cockroach. When we handed her the dead bug (that I killed personally) on a menu of theirs she took it and flung the cockroach onto the floor. She later replied to us, \"what cockroach?\" When we asked her for her management she said that there was none and that it was only her.

I went with the Combination meal of BBQ and Soondubu and chose spicy pork with the combination tofu stew. \n\nI actually ended up with galbi, which was ok and seasoned nicely, not too sweet like some I've tried. The combination soondubu came with shrimp, clams, beef and soft tofu. The ingredients were pretty good and my \"medium spicy\" broth had a nice kick. Though it didn't have the depth of flavor at my favorite spot Pyung Chang in Oakland.\n\nWhat is cool about this place is that in addition to the 6 or so small plates of panchan, they also serve one fried fish for each person. We had a party of 5, and I thought it was rather generous of the kitchen. Then for dessert they give you a small yogurt drink, apparently helpful for digestion.\n\nTheir drink menu includes soju (unflavored), nigori sake, beer, and different types of Korean wine.", "author": "Derrick V."}

I usually go there for the Soon doo bu.\n\nThings to get:\n1) The girl server - she's really nice and understands what you want . For example if you say I'd like some water. She will ACTUALLY BRING WATER not like #1 on the list below.\n\n2) ANY soon doo bu (Around 9 bucks) . It's pretty decent. It's no SOCAL BCD but it gets the job done. Comes piping hot so the egg isn't left.\n\n3) Galbi is pretty good. I've got it a few times and yeah it's a bit on the oily side but it's decent\n\nThings to NOT get:\n\n1) THE GUY SERVER SUCKS-- borderline retarded (mostly because he can't speak English). I go here about once a week and pray to god each and every time that this \"server\" won't mess up my order. But alas each time no green onions for my friend becomes translated to me not getting green onions and no tea.. yeah just try to get the girl waitress. I haven't figured out when she works there but u'll thank me.\n\n2) the BBQ pork- it's dry and there's not meat for the price. Just overall not worth your time.\n\nThings you get regardless:\n1) all the banchan (is that how u spell it?) is pretty good. Sprouts, kimchi, the fish cake thing, a deep fried fish, rasdish string thins, and i think kimchi-ed cucumbers.", "author": "Bryant Y."}

Anyways I ate lunch at DooBu and was very pleased. \n\nThe menu is categorized very nicely: tofu soups, combo plates, special plates, salads, etc. The even have a really great lunch box special (Mon-Fri) that gets you 3 sides, a main dish, and a tofu soup and salad for $7.95! Too bad I don't work near Japan Town right?\n\nI had narrowed my choices down to the Vegetable Soon Tofu, which is a soup and the Silken Tofu Salad which sounded delightful. I was in a more silken (raw) tofu mood, so I went with the salad. It was perfect, the dressing was light and had a subtle ginger flavor. The tofu was also perf. not too firm, but not falling apart. The chunks were a good size and there were plenty of them throughout the salad. The best part was my lunch was only $5.95. \n\nI really would like to try their lunch box special soon.

Rice is similarly prepared and served in metal ware; water is added to the crisped rice in the stone bowl and served as a end-of-meal soup.  The other dishes are very tasty and appropriately spicy for my taste.  I ate some medium spicy food with a friend and found it slightly flat.\n\nThe Yakult has a large load of live Acidophillis culture, and I drank it in Mexico as a GI aid (since I ate food from street vendors).  It tastes like the Japanese Calpico/Calpis.\n\nI knew the owner before I tried her restaurant.  I like her even more now.

Dinner consisted of 1 hour for eating and at least 1 hour of waiting for a seat. The food at MTH was mediocre even when famished. \n\nSince discovering Doobu during their grand opening week, I haven't returned to MTH once. The soon dobu here is delicious and the must-get item. They also offer other items on the menu (kalbi, bi bim bap, etc), but the soon dobu is the best here. It is a tofu house, after all. With your soon dobu is a bowl of bean rice that they scoop right by your table. Each person gets an individual clay pot of rice. Once they scoop it out, they'll fill the pot with tea (so you can enjoy it as jook later). That's one of the many things I love about this place. The bean rice makes all the difference. \n\nAdmittedly, their banchan is not my favorite. The usual offerings are kimchi, fried crocker, seaweed, bean sprouts, fish cake, and one or two other things. That's my one complaint. The bf says tofu houses are not known for good banchan, but I've been to a few in other cities where both the soon dobu and the banchan were equally delicious. Minus one star.\nThis place seems to have grown in popularity lately. Good for them! It's also important to note here that even with business booming, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. \n\nFor soon dobu in the city, my recommendation goes to Doobu. The tofu is excellent as is the extra offerings (e.g. bean rice, yogurt drink for dessert). If you are looking for something else, there is always an hour-long wait list with your name on it at MTH.", "author": "Rona J."}

The combo soondubu was good and the beef bibimbop was extra crispy....just the way I like it.

Also, i notice there was only one waitress working tonight but she was still very attentive and always came back to refill my tea. 5 stars for her. my bf and i left her a $7 tip on a $27.00 bill for the excellent service.\ni love Doobu! :D", "author": "Carol Y."}

Honestly Korean food in SF isn't all that impressive but at Doobu, it's pretty solid at least the comfort foods. \n\nWe had the Beef Dolsot Bibimbap ($11.95 or something close to it) where you get veggies and meat served a la stone pot. I love smashing the rice against the hot stone and letting it get super crispy. Mmm. You must use patience though and let the rice cook. Very difficult to exercise self control.\n\nThe Tofu Soon Doobu is also super yummy. We got the combo Tofu and Beef  Bulgogi ($17.95). You get a mini pot of soup w/ tofu, seafood if you like or other combos that they offer. It's great on a cold day, and the soup is sooo flavorful. You get a bowl of red rice (which I find is such a nice touch) and of course all the Pan Chang (aka small side dishes that accompany all orders). You get 5 or 6 different varieties from kim chee to sweet tempura to chap chae (glass noodles) to daikon. Oh you get a fried fish too. This was crispy and delicious.\n\nThe Bulgogi (bbq beef) was served on a sizzling plate with sliced onions. I find this dish a bit lacking. I've had better, where the meat has marinated longer and you simply get more of it.\n\nThe best part of the meal is when you're given a mini yogurt drink. Memories of my youth float back.

Earlier this week, we headed over to our favorite Korean restaurant, Doobu, nestled in the heart of Japantown. \n\nWhen you walk in, you notice the clean, simple decor with wooden booths on one side and tables on the other side just before the bar.  A literal layer of warmth emanates throughout the place, an indication of the piping hot dishes being prepared in the kitchen.  Servers are courteous and acknowledge familiar faces like ours.  They bring out a myriad of side dishes including a whole fried yellow croaker for each of us, pickled cucumber, kimchi, fishcake, seaweed salad and vermicelli salad. \n\nWe order the kimchi tofu soup, with beef and medium heat.  The cast iron pot is filled to the brim with silky soft tofu, bits of beef and kimchi, and the pretty red chili flecks characteristic of kimchi.  We quickly stir in the raw egg while it's hot.  It's so good over rice which soaks up the flavorful broth.  The rice, by the way, is a light purple color as a result of combining both white rice and black rice together.  We've had the corned beef soon tofu before but the kimchi version is tastier. \n\nWe also share the seafood bibimbap loaded with mussels, clams, squid, baby shrimp, assorted vegetables like mushrooms and onions, and an egg yolk all piled on top of white rice which has a delicious crispy layer coating the bottom of the sizzling pot.  The only thing that doesn't seem to mesh with the other ingredients is the imitation crab.  Nevertheless, it is very satisfying.\n\nDoobu is the perfect warm-you-up-from-the-inside-out place for a cold, foggy San Francisco day or night.  They give you such heaping portions that it's best to go when you are really hungry, and even then, you will leave stuffed and possibly with leftovers.

What could be better than a nice hot 'n spicy bowl of soon dubu?\n\nI passed by this place a few times, before I ventured in. But it is Korean Town ... errr Japan Town after all. So I was a little dubious of it at first.\n\nOn my first visit, I got the Kimchi Soon Dubu. I ordered it spicy. The broth was buttery in flavor, which I found odd. I almost wanted to let the damn thing cool down to see what kind of hardened fat layer would appear. Also, there very little kimchi in it.\n\nOn my second visit, I got the Hae Mul Soon Dubu (seafood). This time, the broth lost its buttery taste (which was a good thing). The shrimp was overcooked and lacking in flavor (probably frozen). \n\nOverall, this is a so-so place. The spicy broth isn't really that spicy or flavorful. The banchan is also just so-so. The people there are nice, but the service can be a bit spotty at times.\n\nOh, and the Yakult they give you at the end? Think of the taste of the orangey taste of liquefied children's aspirin. A bit too sweet for me.\n\nHmmm, I wonder what the next Korean establishment in J-town will be....", "author": "Mobile B."}

Well, we only had 5 people in our party, so we were quite surprised when the check took extra long to get to our table because the waitress was calculating the 18% gratuity that she thought we should add to her tip.  When we pointed out that the 18% automatic tip did NOT apply to our table according to the terms of the policy spelled out on the menu sitting right in front of her, the waitress inexplicably told us that the 18% automatic tip actually applied to parties of 4 or more.  That's a lie, because I've been to Doobu with a party of four recently and, consistent with the normal practice, we were allowed to determine our own level of tip.

In the heart of Japantown, I would never have guessed this place would be any good, but we wanted something quick before the Asian-American film festival. \n\nThe tofu was super-spicy.  First off, let me tell you about the 3 physiological indicators that help me gauge the spiciness of food:\n\nLevel 1: My scalp constricts and gets itchy.  This is actually a pretty new phenomenon, probably about 2 years old, after I ate a particularly large dose of wasabi.  My scalp felt like it was on fire, and ever since then, it gets itchy when I experience a medium level of hotness.\n\nLevel 2: My left nipple gets hard.  I don't know why, but it does, and it's kind of unnerving.  I noticed this, for some reason, after having the Quizno's hot sauce once day and I could feel my shirt rubbing against my nipple (not that I find their hot sauce hot, it just seemed to have spurred this reaction).\n\nLevel 3: My right nipple gets hard.  This takes some super spice to get to this stage.\n\nAnyway, the tofu at this place was right nipple.... err, I mean Level 3.  It was so spicy I actually coughed after taking my first spoonful of tofu.  But it was delicious.\n\nAs well, the galbi was quite above average, I really liked it.  The 2 Qs (Quality and Quantity) were pretty high for me, so this place was a real treat.  As well, the side dishes were good, especially the jap chae (which was superior to Korea House).\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place, it's just a bit shy of Myung Dong in the South Bay, but very good.", "author": "Stan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-24", "description": "I visited Japan Town for the first time last night. When I mentioned to my friends that I had been craving fried tofu they suggested we have dinner at DooBu Korean BBQ & Tofu Restaurant. We got there at around 7 PM. and there were a few other people having dinner, but the place felt empty. The space is small but quaint. There are colorful geometric paintings on the walls that brighten up the place. Our server/waiter was really nice and polite. He was smiling the whole time. Before placing our orders I used the restroom to wash my hands. The ladies' room was small but very clean and no funky smells. From looking at the menu, I was torn between the meat dishes and the tofu dishes. Later I found out you can ask them to mix the meat with the tofu. I decided on the Tofu Bibimbap. As the menu reads, the tofu is served with mixed vegetables and egg yolk over rice in a sizzling stone pot. My friends ordered the Fried Tofu Salad and the Haemul Pajun (assorted seafood & green onion mixed pancake in sizzling stone plate). As we waited for our meals, an array of appetizers were brought out as a part of the meal. Among the offerings were kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, rice noodles and what my friend called \"fat noodles\". Everything was just as it should be. I particularly enjoyed the seaweed salad and the rice noodles. The noodles were delicate and had a hint of garlic. The seaweed salad had a very natural taste compared to the kind of seaweed salad I've had at Japanese restaurants. Before I had had a chance to try all of the appetizers, our meal had arrived at the table. The sizzling hot pot is such a tease. I couldn't wait to dig in but it was definitely too hot! As I write this the morning after, my tongue is still a little sensitive trying to recover some lost taste buds. Bibimbap is a fun dish because you get to play with it somewhat while you stir the egg yolk and watch it cook. You also need to make sure you stir enough so the rice doesn't burn and stick to the bottom of the bowl. It's ok to let some of the rice get crispy though. The crispy rice adds a delicious flavor and nice texture to the dish. I added spicy sauce to my dish and stirred it in until I just had to taste it. The food was too hot but I chewed slowly and drank some water after. Everything just melted together and filled my mouth with a wonderful savory comfort I should feel guilty about. I let my tongue cool down a bit and tried the Fried tofu salad my friend ordered. The salad was a pretty basic mixture of lettuce and carrots, cucumbers and onions. The dressing is really tasty and the fried tofu was a little crunchy on the outside and firm on the inside and didn't feel greasy at all. Before returning to my bibimbap, I also tried my other friend's haemul pajun. It was also hot but it had cooled enough by that point so as not to cause any more damage on my tongue. This dish was a delightful mix of pizza and omelet and seafood and noodles. The bottom was slightly crispy from being on the sizzling stone and the middle was just a little gooey from the noodles. The egg held everything together and you could actually eat a slice as you would a pizza. I finished my bibimbap after touring the rest of the dinner plates on the table. Every bite was just as warm and delicious as the last. It was the perfect dish for a cold evening. After the meal I felt satisfied and still retained the light feeling from before the meal began. Taking this into consideration, and the desire to give a proper review, I decided to order the dessert. Mochi Ice Cream is the only dessert option but you can choose from green tea, strawberry, mango and vanilla. They were out of green tea last night and I ordered the mango and my friend ordered the strawberry. The presentation is cute and simple with the single mochi ball on a small plate drizzled in strawberry syrup. The mochi ball tasted good although I'm sure someone in the back just opened a package anyone can find at the grocery store. I did appreciate the presentation and that it wasn't overpriced. In fact, nothing seemed overpriced at all. I felt the portions were appropriate and was actually surprised that the whole meal for the three of us was just $41.00. Overall I enjoyed the meal and I am truly a fan now. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to try Korean food for the first time.", "author": "Daisy S."}

One can choose the level of spiciness for your dish, if you love spicy dishes and you think you can handle it, go with spicy! (Spicy is like fire breathing, don't do it unless you are a veteran). Go with with medium so you don't over kill the flavor of your dish. As far as cleanliness, it see they maintain this place very clean, and the staff is always welcoming. Some may ask about the rice because it's a purple tint, let me just sprinkle you that it's mixed with wild rice which makes it taste a lot better and gives it that color. During these winter times this is a great location to come and have a hot bowl. Oh! Being a Korean restaurant there is the traditional pre-condoments including fried fish!
