Her husband had reserved the entire restaurant out for about 80 people and she had no idea! It was a complete surprise. He has communicated with the restaurant about food options, number of people, and even having kids attend the venue and they were super accommodating. The space is large and you have a wonderful ambiance of just romance and time to yourself and loved ones. I love the dim light and \"be amazing\" sign- it's a little touch of classiness. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely be back here next time with just my group of friends or even my bf.", "author": "S S."}

This is strictly in regards to the bar area / outdoor area and the bartenders. \n\nI did my birthday here a few weeks back and brought over 50 guests. In addition to experiencing it myself, I had several friends tell me that the bartenders were rude and snotty. Disappointing to get that NYC Meatpacking / LA pretentious vibe in a city that is typically void of any of that BS.\n\nSummer Sunday parties were still dope though.

Started with Spanish Tots (turned out to be tater tots with salsa--very disappointing) and Smoked Cornbread (small pieces of fried cornbread with a delicious honey sauce but couldn't taste anything but honey and corn). The drinks were great. We had the Santeria (deep robust spice) and the Wrong Way (excellent). The baby kale salad was good, as was the market fish: salmon. \n\nWe sat at a table on the right as you walk in. There are love seats for chairs and they are low, reclined and hard--super uncomfortable. The music was so loud I couldn't hear the person directly across the table. The waiter said it was impossible for them to turn it down. The atmosphere was dark and loud, and just not conducive to an enjoyable dinner.", "author": "Maria B."}

You wouldn't expect such a nice spot in this area but it's like a little oasis in here. Atmosphere is great during the day and at night. Service is always very friendly. Not too far of a walk from the BART (which is good cause parking isn't fun).\n\nDuring our first visit we got 2 cocktails and a freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Food during brunch was more on the average side. We got a burger, an egg scramble, and a pork belly dish. They were all (3.25-3.5 stars) with the pork belly dish being the most flavorful. It was a sizeable and rich piece but not quite enough for the price. For once the cocktails were better than the food.\n\nDuring my second visit we got the following:\n1) Pork Belly w/ Ravioli (small plate): My favorite plate of the night. Pork belly had a great fat to lean meat ratio. The lean meat was pretty tender and there was a ton of flavor from the delicious earthy and slightly sweet mushroom sauce. The ravioli was so light but so good. I want a whole bowl of them (4.75/5)\n\n2) Confit Octopus: So tender with mild flavors all working very well together then the chorizo and olives packing little punches while the butter beans helped mellow it back out. (4.5/5)\n\n3) Vegan dish of the day (Risotto): Friend's dish. It was underwhelming. Like a soupy rice congee where the kernels didn't disintegrate and with corn. Flavors were very bland (2/5)\n\n4) Market Fish: I believe it was king salmon. Friend's dish and it was quite small for the price but she said it tasted really good.\n\n5) Pork Chop: Friend's dish. Slightly larger portion than a lot of the other items. Looked very juicy and she enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, my experiences here have been great. In general I do find the portions a bit small for the price. I wouldn't say brunch is worth it but the flavors from the dinner dishes are (with the exception of the vegan risotto). Would happily come again if my bank account isn't hurting too much.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Because of her we decided to cancel our reservation some where else and to stay for dinner in the main dining room. I believe our server for dinner was Christina. Again, amazing! So hopeful with the menu, so sweet. She was just fun to talk to and gave us great recommendations! \nShe even brought us out a delicious creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. We were so stunned with her generosity and kindness. It actually happened to be my husband's birthday too but we didn't even say anything so it was such a treat to have that as a surprise.

If you're not familiar with Chambers (like me) you'll come to realize that Chambers restaurant shares a space with an old school motel. Chambers still manages to maintain it's classy restaurant/bar on one side, but allows goers to sit outside in the shared space they have with the motel. At first it was kinda weird seeing a pool in the middle of the place, but it has a nice retro vibe that seems to be a popular spot for weekend brunch (I came on a Thursday night). \n\nThey have a solid happy hour menu that consists of a cheese plate, patatas bravas, cheeseburger/fries, brussel sprouts, etc. I opted for the cheeseburger w/fries ($12) and it was solid and I would get it again. \n\n+ The burger was a good size and came with a side of super crispy fries. For $12 in SF I thought it was a great deal because I was full after eating it. \n+ Patatas Bravas were OK. Not the best I've had but it's a huge bowl that you can share with your table. \n+ Cheese plate was meh. I don't think I would get it again because the size didn't seem worth the price, but it you want something light to pair with your drinks it is a good option to get. \n\nI really liked the atmosphere outside but the service was a little slow. If you're sitting outside you need to come inside to order your food and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you. When we came for happy hour it took about 10-15 mins standing at the bar to get their attention when it wasn't that packed yet. That was probably the only thing because they were quick to bring it outside. \n\nOverall, I'm really curious to see this place on the weekend because from previous reviews it seems like this is the place to be! I did enjoy my first time here and I think it's an awesome spot to come with friends and get some discounted bites.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

The biscuits and gravy were also a great deal as a \"side\" because the portions were huge!

Follow them in of course! \nInside was this dark lit eccentric space with vinyls lining all their shelves and walls, top to bottom. The playlist was a mix of throwback r&b to funk-hip sounds of today. The seating was a mix of couches with low tables seating, and plenty of communal seating.

It was amazingly flavored with sunny side eggs, black beans, avocado, hard shell tostada, queso fresco, green and red salsa.

I had a old fashioned and it was very good.  I usually don't order old fashioned because some bartenders make it too sugary.  This one seemed on the smaller side, but it was tasty and hit the spot.  Sometime size doesn't matter. =P  \n\nI thought the drink prices were reasonable for San Francisco.  \n\nI think the only downside was that the bar chairs are so big and heavy that they get in the way when you're trying to order a drink.  \n\nI drove and I was able to find parking about a block and a half away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-21", "description": "Located on the Phoenix Hotel property, Chambers is a real hidden gem in Tenderloin. So hidden that finding it is a little confusing - the entrance is on Eddy St through the brown double doors. Chambers has a GORGEOUS inside... the ambiance is so chic and modern with walls divided by shelves of records. There's even that \"BE AMAZING\" sign at the bar which seems iconic to this place. This is a nice place in Tenderloin for a romantic and intimate date.\n\nToo bad they sat us OUTSIDE despite having reservations. I was pretty peeved when I found out later that they had 2 reservation systems, and for that particular night there were a lot of conflicts in the system for bookings. I really would have loved to sit inside and enjoy the decor... but had to settle for a heated outdoor patio next to the pool. Don't get me wrong - the pool at Phoenix Hotel is gorgeous, but our view wasn't so great since they had put down wall drapes in the patio wall. So we could see the pool through a plastic screen. On the bright side, it was quieter so I could hear my partner better, but it also made for a kind of eeriness.\n\nAside from that slight oversight, the food is geared towards Asian fusion and is pretty damn good. We had a Gilt City voucher for a $150 dining credit (paid $80), so we ordered a bunch of small plates to try a variety. Our server was nice enough to space them out like courses, thus we had the following:\n\n- Sizzling Kobe Tri-Tip ($16): THIS WAS DELICIOUS... ~6 slices of kobe beef still cooking on a sizzling stone. I like my meat medium rare, so it was nice to control that. Because the beef is already sliced, you can taste the delicious meat juices at full capacity without cutting into it. Honestly the yuzu-soy sauce did nothing for this meat - it was delicious on its own. So delicious that we ordered it twice since the portion is pretty tiny.\n\n- Pancetta Wrapped Dates ($9): I had high hopes for this, but at the end of the day it was lackluster. It wasn't bad... but it tasted so generic. I would've been fine with just bacon wrapped dates from Starbuck's late night menu. I would pass as you're paying $3 per skewer.\n\n- Oyster Bao Bun ($12): These were surprisingly good! Oysters crispy and bao was fluffy/tasty on its own. The remoulade sauce and tabasco gave it a nice Creole kick. It was an interesting combination of Creole + Asian flavors. Too bad the portion was quite small (3 per serving), but we ordered 2 of these anyways. \n\n- Potato Gnocchi ($14): Sauce and mushrooms were on-point. The gnocchi itself is kind of soggy - still tasty, but I expect a bit of bite and chewiness in my gnocchi.\n\n- Crispy Pork Belly ($15): Honestly this was disappointing - not only is it expensive for the portion, it's not very crispy and the texture of the soft fat is kind of unappealing. Flavor wise it was kind of all over the place with the fig chutney and bacon sherry sauce - it just didn't go well together.\n\n- Fried Brussel Sprouts ($8): 2nd best thing we had that night... the portion surprised us because it was so big compared to the rest of the dishes! The brussel sprouts are flash fried so they get that really nice char flavor. Tossed with the Gochujang sauce, you get a nice Korean spice that goes well with the savory Parmesan cheese. This was well worth the price.\n\n- Alive ($12): Cucumber, mint, agave, and vodka - what's not to like? It was a refreshing drink that paired well with all the savory items I had. I prefer my drinks on the sweeter side, but this had a good balance of being strong and sweet.\n\nThey also have non-alcoholic cocktails for designated drivers... unfortunately I couldn't remember the names of them, but my companion had a carrot juice + yuzu cocktail that they seemed to enjoy, It certainly looked like a cocktail - way to make those designated drivers not feel left out.\n\nOverall... good food and great ambiance (assuming you sit outside in the winter and not in the covered patio). It's kind of an oasis in gritty neighborhood of Tenderloin (BTW, just take an Uber here as the area was super sketch at night). Portions are small and pricey, but if you come here with a discounted voucher or only want drinks with a few bites (Kobe Tri-Tip and brussel sprouts), then it's well worth it IMO.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

They even calmed my craziness as the stress hit :) \n\nOn the day of the event, my large party and I enjoyed an attentive staff, delicious food, and a wonderful atmosphere. Considering how tasty everything was, the price was quite reasonable. When we asked a staff member to take a photo, she even suggested the perfect spot on the patio. \n\nI highly, highly recommend planning large events at Chambers. You will have a great experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-12", "description": "This review is for reserving a table at the lounge. \n\nI had an amazing birthday party at Chambers because of my fantastic friends, not because of the venue. I made arrangements with Malik, the now previous event manager, who was absolutely fantastic! He answered all my emails promptly, and sent me all the menus and price lists. His replacement Isabel was fine, but I think things got lost in translation during the transition process. \n\nTo reserve a semi-exclusive area at the Chambers Lounge, you have to put a minimum of $300 (pre-tax with additional tip) on one credit card, which they keep on file to reserve your spot. This is the card used for all transactions. \n\nFOOD - 1-Star \nIsabel was awesome enough to tell me that I could avoid a cake cutting fee if I brought cupcakes, which I did. But I also requested a comp'd dessert that they could bring out with a candle, which NEVER ARRIVED! My good friend had to request a candle to put on one of the cupcakes I brought myself. I also ordered chips and dip as a basic snack to have around in case my guest got hungry, which they were super timid to eat because they were located on a table that was really far from where we were sitting. Essentially I purchased a family-sized bag of Lays potato chips and a gigantic bowl of dip for $40!! I was told this was truffle dip, but it tasted like ranch. Do not waste your money on this. You will feel like an idiot. \n\nSERVICE - 1-Star for the Server / 4-Stars for the Bartenders\nWhen I arrived at the venue, the server was there to greet me. She was very friendly and lovely enough to help me setup the cupcakes and show me the menu. Unfortunately, my guest trickled in for about an hour/hour and a half after I arrived, and she was missing for the majority of the night. Many of my guest didn't know we had a server, which I was upset to hear from them. Not one, not two, but several people told me the next day. I was not about to play babysitter at my own party for a server getting a guaranteed 20% tip. I distinctly told her that she was free to charge my card whenever friends ordered drinks. I was distraught to hear that she didn't take a single order. Since most of my friends ordered from the terrific bartenders, I emailed the manager to complain. I even asked her if the gratuity I paid could go to the bartenders. She gave me an excuse saying that I needed to be present for all transactions since it was my card. Why on Earth is it necessary to approve each of my 20 guests transactions when I pre-approved this on the phone and then in person? She completely avoided the topic of the bartenders, which tells me that they didn't get a dime. I even asked her to look at my tab to see how many drinks were placed by the server versus the bartenders, and she never got back to me. \n\nTable - 3-Stars\nSince there are only 3 semi-exclusive areas and I was the last to reserve, I probably got the worst of the bunch. I got 3 small tables near the restaurant, away from the main lounge space. This was farthest from the music, which might have been a blessing in disguise to facilitate more conversations. We were given another table that was placed against the wall, probably 8 feet from our table to hold food and balloons. Pros included privacy during the beginning of the night and being closer in access to the beautiful courtyard. However, as the lounge filled up, way too many people were passing our area and trying to snatch food from our table.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend reserving a table at Chambers. Nobody should have to deal with terrible service like this. I've been to the lounge many many times before, so I had high expectations. Frankly, now when I think of Chambers, I am appalled.", "author": "Joanna S."}

We need more brunch spots that take reservations so you don't have to wait hours in line.\n\nChambers isn't in the best spot in the TL; I parked my car on the same block and there were a couple sketchy people chilling in the area. Luckily my car was fine when I finished with brunch.\n\nEven though we had a reservation, we still ended up waiting for maybe 10-15 minutes at the front before our table was ready. I believe they have an outside patio area as well, but we were seated inside. It was much louder inside than I expected, which made it harder for us to carry out conversations across the table.\n\nI pretty came here for their souffle pancake ($12) which I had previously seen on someone's Instagram account. I was very intrigued by this dish since the pancake looked like a cake more than a pancake. Their menu says that it takes 35 minutes for the souffle pancake to come out, but for us it took closer to 45 minutes. Don't order it if you're running short on time.\n\nAfter waiting for 45 minutes, I was super excited when the souffle pancake finally came out. First of all, it looks gorgeous with the apple chutney and scoop of maple ice cream on top and all the fruits that decorate it. I don't know how to describe the inside other than as very egg-y and custard-like, which was perfect for me but too much for my friend. It wasn't very sweet and relied on the various toppings for the sweetness, which I appreciate.\n\nIt doesn't look that big, but I was full halfway through and ended up sharing the rest with another friend. In retrospect, I should have just shared it with my friend who also ordered the souffle pancake, since she only finished half of hers.\n\nI made the mistake of ordering a side of crispy hash browns and really regretted it when it came out. For $4 you get one flat piece of hash brown. Just one piece! I've never even seen hash browns served in this shape before...It doesn't make sense that their souffle pancake is $12 but one piece of hash brown is a third of that price.\n\nAll in all, though, I really enjoyed this whole experience and thought the souffle pancake was a great addition to the SF brunch scene!", "author": "Dianna H."}

Plus they are dog friendly!\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION: 4 Stars \n\nIt was hard trying to figure out where the main door entrance was. I also wasn't thrilled that the location is in the tenderloin. Kinda scary to me. When I found the entrance,  the inside of the restaurant looked pretty nice and clean. The host greeted us and lead us to the outside dining area. First thing I notice is a pool and a motel behind it. I was confused. We were seated at our table and that's when our journey begins.\n\nSERVICE: 4 Stars \n\nWe were late so everyone was eating already and we were waiting for our food. But the server made sure to check up on us and tell us that our food was coming. I was happy she was reassuring. She gave our little Pomsky puppy some water. Very sweet of her. The people who serve here are really friendly. Especially when you have a cute pup! \n\nFOOD: 4 Stars \n\nSo I've been here twice before. The first time I got eggs Benedict. It wasn't that great.. Honestly I've had way better. The flavor was just not there for me. But the pork belly with potatoes were soooooo gooooddd. Ever since I've tried the pork belly, I refuse to get anything else. It is my favorite! The soft boiled eggs compliment the pork belly and the potatoes so well. I don't know how they do it. I also had the fresh fruit. Now, normally when restaurants say fresh fruit they lie. I know what fresh fruit tastes like. I'm a fruit addict. Now when Chambers says fresh fruit, you better bet your sweet bottom you're gonna get fresh fruit! I was so surprised to see that the fruit was fresh. It looked and tasted like it was freshly picked and cut just for me lol. I was so happy. \n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE AND REVIEW: 4 Stars \n\nI come here for brunch only. And since I've tasted the pork belly plate, I refuse to eat anything else lol it's just that good. Also, get the fruit if you're a fruit lover. You won't regret it. I also got apple juice from here. It comes in a cute little glass bottle. Loved it. I love bringing my puppy here. It's a great dog friendly spot. I wasn't a big fan of the hotel guests swimming at the pool and staring at us. It feels weird. So that's why I refuse the 5 Stars. Also, some of the workers look like they just got out of bed and not very presentable. Either than that I love this place. Food is great.

Had to ask for an extra napkin.\n\nWaitress highly recommended the fish (without us asking for recommendations), which was cool. Then said, I think that'll really round out your meal, I'm gonna go ahead and add that on for you.\nWait, hold up, let me ask the table of people with me if we want that?!?!? I mean, luckily it sounded good and we did, even if only slightly, and when the fish came out it was a good option, but that was a really really strange way of recommending and then adding it on for us without consent.\n\nI got half my glass of red wine spilled across my lap.

Meanwhile I was trying to soak up the red wine from my dress.\n\nI was offered a new napkin since mine was soaked, then had to ask for it again because it was never brought. I had to also ask for a new glass of wine, of which I was brought a half/quarter pour, which I guess is fair because that's how much was left before it was spilled onto my lap.

It's actually at the Phoenix hotel, and they have seating out by their pool - which I thought was neat. Inside had a very hipster/retro feel with records and couches and lounginess. \n\nCoffee was the most disappointing part. They only do French press and a small ($6 - kinda pricey) is supposed to do 3 cups (small cups, like 6 oz), but ours only poured 2. We complained and they brought us another right away at no charge, but still. Also, I just really feel like bottomless coffee should be a part of brunch. It tasted ok, but not amazing. \n\nGot the chambers mimosa which was quite nice - plenty of champagne as it should be. No bottomless, but really, that's ok.

I am a major hollandaise snob and it takes a lot to impress me and this did. Really perfect balance of lemon and spice. Spot on consistency. The smoked trout was super tasty too.

The summer squash was shaved into a long thin strip and rolled into a rose.

The atmosphere, lighting, music and rocker chic vibe make this a great place to hang and fabulous for hosting an event!\n\nAn excellent space if you are looking for something a little different and beyond the normal wedding venue. It's glam, mid century modern deco style lets you have some fun with the space. There is a great selection of vinyl records (literally THOUSANDS!) throughout that add another level of cool.\n\nWe decided to rent out the back lounge and patio area for our reception/cocktail party after our ceremony in the Phoenix courtyard. What a great experience! Chrissie Dieu, the Director of Events, was exceptional throughout the entire process and over a year of planning. She was able to take every detail we gave her from chair requests to lighting needs to menu planning and make them a reality. There was a great event menu to choose from for our vegetarian only tastes and all our guests raved about the food and cocktails.\n\nIn addition to Chrissie, Chambers and the Phoenix are chock full of quality people. A special shout out goes to Patrick, Host Extraordinaire, who we met on a visit for dinner a couple weeks before the big day. Patrick was fantastic that evening, making us feel welcome and like we were regulars in the house, and on the day of the wedding, he constantly was looking out for our health and happiness, doing everything he could to make sure that we had food and -the tougher challenge- time to eat!\n\nEven the servers and bartenders got rave reviews from our guests! As a former bartender, my newly betrothed was very impressed with the preparation and consistency of our signature drink for the evening, the Toasted Almond. And we have been hearing raves about the bartenders, the food, and the drinks all night long...and even now, weeks later!\n\nWe wanted something different and with a rock n roll vibe - Chambers was it.

Besides the somewhat hidden location inside Phoenix Hotel, the amazing (and very reasonably priced) brunch mostly remains a secret: fancy-pants brunch in a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, plus there is no wait--a great find in a city where a $20 brunch with a 45 minute wait is considered a normal weekend routine.\n\n[THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS BY DAY]\n\nThe menu is fairly extensive and features creative variations on brunch food in which they take everything a step further. There are no pancakes, French toast, or scrambled eggs; only souffle pancakes, spiced French toast, and soft scrambled eggs. Some items add a fusiony spin, incorporating diverse flavors such as Spanish (tortilla omelette), Filipino (loco moco), Korean (gochujang), even San Franciscan (red quinoa).\n\nThe PORK BELLY ($13, two soft boiled eggs, caramelized onion, Yukon potatoes, lollipop kale, gochujang, black garlic, cilantro) made a hearty brunch with the huge block of pork belly. The lollipop kale adds a nice flair. It's melt-in-your-mouth crispy and reminds me of the crispy fried vegetable in Chinese dishes. (Also, it makes you feel healthy because it's kale). \n\nThe SPICED FRENCH TOAST ($12, strawberry mandarin compote, vanilla whipped cream, bourbon syrup).... so many delicious things put together! The description speaks for itself: it tastes as amazing as it sounds.\n\nI had planned to get Saigon Sandos across the street in case we were still hungry afterwards, but we were quite satisfied.\n\n[THE SLIGHTLY-LESS-SECRETIVE CHAMBERS BY NIGHT]\n\nThe ambiance at night is vintage romantic: bookshelves of vinyl records lining the walls, shadowy lighting in warm gold and amber tones, climaxing at the famous \"BE AMAZING\" sign spelled out in light bulbs in the backdrop of the bar. \n\nThe cocktails are good. Not too strong, but nice to sip on and ponder about how to be amazing while relaxing on one of their classy couches and staring at the flickering flame of a candle. One of my favorite cocktail convos:\n\nMe: The pattern on the lights looks like mold when your cell cultures get contaminated\nThe boo: ...those are supposed to be stars... lol way to ruin this romantic ambiance\n\nBe amazing.", "author": "Edna C."}

We did our homework and selected a few restaurants we wanted to visit. Chambers was one in our list, so we booked for Saturday brunch well in advance.\n\nOur first impression of the place was not good. We walked over from our hotel and had to cross through very sketchy areas to find it. When we finally did, we were confused because Chambers is adjacent to a 1950s motor lodge that reminded me of hippie videos I had seen in history class. We weren't sure where the restaurant was, but we soon found there's a separate door to the hotel to enter the restaurant.\n\nOnce inside, Chambers is GORGEOUS!! It's an oasis in the middle of a depressed area of SF. Decoration is a little hipster, with walls covered by vinyl records, modern lighting, and a very cool vibe! Staff is very friendly and will not hesitate to share their advice on what to order. We absolutely followed their recommendations and boy were we in for a treat!\n\nThere are no word to describe how ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS our brunch was. Pictures (although great) still are not enough to show how perfect everything was.

For a table of 6, my group ordered the champagne bottle service ($40) and it was good for 2 glasses per person. They also offer bottomless, but 2 was good enough for our hung over asses. For being semi-busy, the service was very good and the vibe of the restaurant is super chic and cool. They have a contemporary look with all the records, curtains, and dim lighting. Top that off with their soothing music, this place is purrrfeectt for those trying to recover from the night before. \n\nFor food, I love the variety of their menu - from savory to sweet, they offer a lot of choices! My group of 6 tried everyone's dishes and I highly suggest the pork belly or hung over hash as these were the more filling dishes compared to the others. If you want a lighter dish, the red quinoa salad is pretty tasty, but wish they had more prosciuto. The Spanish Omelette, souffle pancake, and burger were okay. The souffle pancake tasted like flour and wasn't anything special, while the Spanish Omelette was good, but everything else with it was random. And the burger is a burger....

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-06", "description": "My hubby and I went here for my brother-in-law's 30th birthday on a Saturday night. My sister made a reservation for about eight of us and we were promptly seated upon arrival. \n\nThe exterior of the restaurant looked like a giant black, windowless box. Thankfully there was a sign next to the restaurant that read \"Chambers\" because we would have definitely missed the place without it. The interior, however, was much more decorative, with beautiful tables and chairs, low warm lighting, and a cozy atmosphere. \n\nWe had a couple of people waiting on us and the service was alright, nothing special. There wasn't anything that particularly stood out. \n\nBecause we had such a large party, we ordered double of the following appetizers: foie gras, kobe beef, pork belly, and house fries. The kobe beef was served on a heated stone that seared the raw meat whilst on the table so that was pretty cool. The pork belly was very tender and tasted great. The foie gras was served with unagi, an interesting flavor that strangely worked well. As for the fries, they came out as giant rectangular cubes that had actual pieces of potato in them.  But we weren't too big of a fan of them since they were more on the bland side. \n\nBecause we were pretty full already, my hubby and I decided to split the Chamber burger with extra avocado. The bun was thinner than we expected, but instead of being crispy, it just tasted like flat bread. The patty was cooked and flavored well though. The side of fries was typical, but we did like the fresh herbs in it. \n\nThen finally for dessert, we ordered the coffee cake. While I understand that typical coffee cake has a crumbly surface, the entire piece of cake was barely holding it together, eliciting a rough texture. It did, however, come with a side of ice cream and honey lavender meringue which softened the cake up just a tad. But the combination of the cake, meringue, and ice cream quickly transformed the dessert to a sickly sweet dish. \n\nSo for the kind of food we got and for the amount, we have to say that Chambers is a little too pricey. We weren't too fond of the food and didn't like how there weren't that many options either. Most of our party just ordered the burger because there wasn't much else to choose from. While the place looks nice, we probably won't be back to a place where the food is mediocre.", "author": "Quyen L."}

Once you enter, it was like a whole other vibe going on.  I was surprised and digging it.  There's an outside, contemporary lounge area that is integrated with a motel and communal poolside.  It's very different on how they combined the two aspects together and it's quite leisurely to sit back outside with a drink on hand.  They have fabulous specialty cocktails as well as bottomless mimosas for 12 bucks with a brunch entr\u00e9e.\n\nI got their Campari drink and it was refreshing while lounging and our party was waiting to be seated.  It took awhile to be seated on a Friday night.  This place gets discreetly packed.  There's a lounge area on the inside and they have these light bulbs lit up to BE AMAZING.  (Key reminder to do so in life.  Thanks, Chambers.)\n\nTheir brunch food as well as their dinner entrees, are wonderful to the palate.  It suits the speakeasy atmosphere and the whole jazz to this happening place.  I love their pork belly with eggs for the morning with mimosas.  Do order their Hangover Hash if you need a recovery from the night before!  It has these unique gelatin, surface-covered, dressing that pops onto the salad with it that I found interesting.  For dinner, their quinoa salad has texture and was healthy with fiber.  I really like their Grit Fries as a bite-sized dish.  Their Pork Belly was smokin' delicious.  Signature burger had a savory taste packed in it.  Hangar steak was cooked perfectly and garnished nicely.

The smoked grits which come in rectangular deep fried blocks stood out to me most for their unique flavor and great texture. The pork sliders ( actually little pork stuffed dough balls sprinkled with sesame) were delicate and delicious small bites. The pork belly was a bit bland to me, the four tiny pieces came out on a very cool looking platter with coals smoking underneath and the spicy pickled vegetables on the side were tasty. The chicken pate with croutons was also just good. I also sampled the polenta with greens and I did not like the texture or flavor, as there was a hint of bitterness. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere.

More than 50% of the tables were empty and even though we asked to sit at one of the tables, the male server said it was reserved and that we couldn't sit there. We were confused since there were so many open seats but said uh okay, kind of walked around to figure out alternative seats and then just kinda stood around the bar. Eventually one of the women who worked there asked if we wanted a seat and told us we could sit at the very table that we originally asked to sit at in the beginning. We stayed for about 1.5 hours and the whole time barely anyone else came into the bar. \n\nSo this place put a really bad taste in my mouth all because of the male server who was serving the main area on the Wednesday before thanksgiving.

We were impressed by the thematic decor and the quality of food, but disappointed by the noise of the happy hour. The bar for happy hour is right next to most of the tables they were utilizing to seat those who had come for dinner. In contrast, the back bar with the beautiful \"Be Amazing\" sign was empty except for a few employees or hotel guests. I didn't understand why everyone was crammed into the front, underutilizing the space the restaurant had. Spending the first part of dinner shouting over people seeing how many Oceans they could guzzle down before seven was unpleasant. It was also strange to me that while we sat 25 feet from the bar, we couldn't order happy hour drinks. Would they have preferred we bought simple bar dishes instead of an entire meal to qualify for a dollar or two off a cocktail? It seems like a poor strategy, but that's just my opinion. \nThe decor of the restaurant is trendy and interesting. It's amusing to see how many records you can recognize on the shelves and snapping a shot in front of the \"Be Amazing\" sign is a must do for an trendy visitor to Chambers. The food was amazing and reasonably priced for a night out in the city. We ordered the Dungeness Crab Cakes, Fried Brussel Sprouts, Beet Salad, Chambers Burger, and the Apple Tart. The Dungeness Crab Cake was our personal favorite of all the dishes we got. The sauce that complimented it was the perfect balance of flavors to match the fresh crab!

And it was pretty eye opening. \n\nThis place reminds me of the restaurants in Silverlake, Los Angeles. Trendy/hipsterish vibe in a somewhat sketchy looking neighborhood. Prices are definitely spendy for what you get. But the food and concept is brilliant. \n\nMy favorite dish was the one I had ordered, the soft scrambled eggs with peas and szechuan style chili oil. What I was expecting was a ginormous scramble egg(it was $12), and a bit of greens on the side. But this dis had a very small portion of eggs, maybe 3 eggs? But felt more like 2. A bit disappointed on the egg front. But it was soft, still a bit running, exactly what I wanted that morning. But what I loved about this dish was the peas, mushroom, and other greens. It was perfectly seasoned, fresh, sweet, and just overall surprisingly delicious. The Szechuan style chili was unnecessary, but I think they had a theme going on, soooo sure why not. If you used the chili oil/sauce, it's not bad either. Try it out for yourself. It's very szechuan.\n\nAmong all the other dishes my party ordered were the Hangover hash(love the name), and the pork belly entree. \n++The hangover hash had the most amazing presentation, and the most disappointing small piece of pastrami ever. But it was so tender, so fatty and rich, and SO GOOD. I just want a plate full of that please. \n+The pork belly entree had very nice presentation as well. This had a Korean theme going on. Since it's served with gochujang, it's automatically Korean. And we did have a Korean at our table, he dared to say it was the best thing he's ever eaten. Not sure if he is exaggerating, but I thought it was not bad. \n\nThose were among the most memorable dishes I tried. Not sure if I would order the souffle pancake Marcus ordered, thought it was kinda pricey and I would much rather just have a souffle or just pancake. But that's just me.\n\nOh yeah, $14 bottomless mimosas! Our server was very good about topping us off. That's always awesome. I had quite a good experience here. Definitely recommend if you want a nice relaxing brunch next to the pool.", "author": "Jackson Y."}

The food was wonderful and the service was great.\n\n\nFOOD:\nSouffle pancake - i saw a picture of this on yelp and it was covered with strawberries.  I ordered this and it came with an apple topping so i'm assuming it just comes with whatever is convenient or in season.  I had never heard of a souffle pancake before.  This dish takes about 20 mins to make but it was really good.  Think of a pancake with a consistency that is somewhere in between a souffle and a regular pancake.  Awesome.\n\nBiscuits and gravy - i tried some of the gravy that came with this.  Outstanding.  There are bits of pork belly in it.  Yes, i put some on my souffle pancake.\n\nPork belly and pastrami - both really good.  Tender and tasty.  \n\n\nDRINK: AYCD mimosas (Sat brunch only w/ purchase of entree).  Decent mimosas here.

Decor was funky, servers were wearing furs with bowling shoes, it was pretty cool.\n\nThe food for the most part was decent, maybe average, maybe bad. The tri tip though unique, was a tiny portion and lacked seasoning. And it's served wth soy sauce which adds nothing. Oh, and it's $16. Another sad dish is the $30 hanger steak. Tiny portion served over what looked snd tasted like canned beans. Hanger steak and tri tip are medium quality cuts and they shouldn't be charging top tier prices for tiny baby portions.\n\nWhat was good was the polenta. Velvety in texture and the broccoli raab it was served with offered a burst of salt which was pleasing. The black cod was also good.. But again a tiny portion.\n\nAll in all the meal was okay. The service was somewhat inattentive. The prices... Astronomical. $191. If it were around $130 I'd be happier with my experience. But at this price point, chambers is just another over priced over hyped sub par eatery.", "author": "Peter T."}

This was a great find for brunch when we couldn't get into the Creole place (you know which one). We were seated right away as there was no wait shortly after Chambers opened. There is definitely a pretentious hipster vibe going on, but the food is amazing so I can't hate too much. \n\nTo start, the 4 of us split an order of biscuits and gravy--I typically hate this dish and the appearance of it would make me cringe, but Chambers made an amazing rendition.  They added Japanese togarashi spice to their enormous, homemade, fluffy biscuits as well as to the meaty and creamy gravy. Why this is considered a SIDE item confuses me, as I would definitely eat this with some fruit and their French pressed coffee for a satisfying mid morning meal.\n\nI was in the mood for a bit of a breakfast hodgepodge so I ordered a plate of fresh fruit, a side of challah bread with homemade guava compote served in a cute little mason jar (which they put in my to go box afterward), and chicken maple sausage. I ordered way too much food -- I could have shared those things amongst 3 people and we all would have been plenty full as each side was HUGE. As for my friends, they ordered the pork belly, the hangover hash, and eggs in a hole. Each plate was, again, ginormous as well as beautifully presented.

The host asked if we had a reservation when we walked in. It didn't look too busy, but you may want to make one if you plan to eat there. We told the host we were just there for drinks. He told us we could order at the bar and then take it out to the cabanas by the pool. WHAT?! I thought I heard wrong too, but no, they really have a POOL in the back!! The inside of Chambers is pretty big and has very cute, hip d\u00e9cor. \n\nI wanted to get bottomless mimosas for $14, but you had to order an entr\u00e9e to get the $14 deal.

I wanted a private space for my guests to celebrate yet not too secluded so I can get the feel of \"nightlife.\" Chrissie who works on the events end at the Restaurant and Bar was so easy to work with and communicated back and forth effortlessly, something I really take into account when working with other event industry folks. I got to rent out the enclosed patio area by the pool with a food and bev minimum of $1000. Chrissie even let me split it two 2 checks to cover the $1000 which was awesome because I just had my birthday dinner there with my closest girlfriends and then the staff rearranged the area for the night portion for drinks when my other friends arrived at 9pm. I preordered platters of food and my friend bought a bottle and we covered the $1000 min easily. I got to bring in a photo booth and the servers kept my two tier specialty cake in the kitchen up until my guests arrived so it just wasn't sitting there out in the open. They even tried to help me salvage it after my friend drove over a pot hole or whatever and broke half of my huge cake topper -_- I only wished that the patio area had some sort of sanctions as the other end across the walkways from the entrance is where the public can sit and they kept coming into my section trying to use my photo booth but of course I 86 their asses before they even pressed the button to start the booth. However, after I discussed this with security they were keeping a watchful eye over these two tacky girls who tried to sneak in telling me a bartender said they could use it and then tried to call me a B**** when I walked away but not before my friend heard and was ready to throw down on her and I had to intervene and tell her she needs to leave with her friend before my friend pounds her to a pulp because I know her, and I know she could mess this girl up easily.

The front side has plenty of booths and a long, slender dining table with a real fireplace exclamation point. On the back end is an open space with large chaise lounge seating, great for groups.

It's over priced and doesn't actually look like a shareable plate like the menu suggests.\n\nChicken wings - 8 very, very, very tiny chicken wings. They barely had any meat on them and the watered down blue cheese sauce was pretty terrible.\n\nLamb pancetta dates - By far the best tasting dish. Really tasty but only 3 tiny dates in each serving, for the price of $12 or $13. Cmon. \n\nBuffala polenta - A very small scoop on a large shallow bowl. The presentation made it look more appetizing than it was. It was so bland. So so so bland. \n\nFries - The largest portion of food we had. A generous portion of french fries served with ketchup. I think this was $6 and the only thing we agreed was worth the money.", "author": "Sarah S."}

When you walk in, you are surrounded by walls lined with vintage records and the place overall looks pretty gosh darn cool.  Dimly lit, spacious with booths everywhere!  Chambers has a very speak easy feel to it.\n\nFor brunch, we got the Japanese Omelet \"Tamago\" (house-smoked chorizo, sweet potato, cana de oveja, scallions) and Tofu Hash (brussel sprouts, oyster mushrooms, red onions, garlic confit, farro, almond).  Both of which were very flavorful and unique...different from any brunch foods I've ever had.  I'm not even sure how I would compare it to something else!  \n\nThe \"Tamago\" was a little sweet but complimented well with the salty chorizo and scallions!  The sweet potatoes were very thin and crisp, almost like fried wonton wraps... which gave a nice crunch to each bite!  I'm not really that big of a fan on cheese, so that big block of cana de oveja was a little overwhelming.  If you've never had cana de oveja, (with my very limited cheese knowledge) it's most comparable to Brie.\n\nTofu Hash in itself was just tasty overall.  A bit oily and the tofu was almost tasteless, but it helped balance a lot of the flavor that came from the other foods in the dish.  We also added two sunny side eggs to the dish which I thought was the perfect addition - so I recommend that you do add the eggs if you choose the Tofu Hash!\n\nI had a good brunch here and would love to come back again!

We made reservations for 7 p.m. on a Saturday night (can you tell that we're overly cautious out-of-towners?). We showed up a little after 6 p.m. because we happened to be ready early and left early. The restaurant was nearly empty. We are sooo not hip, you guys.\n\nThe hostess was super nice and we got a table right away. We were immediately in love with the feel of the restaurant - dark, cozy, romantic, yet super....wait for it...hip! And funky, and sexy. This is a great place to go for romance, or even not romance - there were lots of groups as well later on in the night. \n\nYou're probably not here to read about how the place looks, though. Right? You wanna know if we liked the food and booze. \n\nYes, yes, we did. We started off with an appetizer (dungeness crab arancini) which was ah-mazing. They only give you three, though, which is disappointing. To go with our appetizer and eventual entrees, the fiance had Lagunitas while I had the \"Salt of the Earth\" - tequila, agave, and a jalapeno (though I omitted the jalapenos due to allergies. Go ahead, laugh - it's such a weird allergy). His entree was the tri-tip with a side of fries. I only tried the fries, and was obsessed with the herbs. My entree was the short rib with sweet potatoes, kale, etc. I didn't love my entree as much. The best part of the meal, though, was the dessert. We got the strawberry parfait. GET IT. It's so fruity, creamy, and rich, topped of with a sprig of mint. Yum! \n\nThe waitstaff were nice and prompt without being overbearing. \n\nHere's where hipness really eludes me, though. I had to use the restroom at the end of our time there. I went in and was shocked not only by its size - the size of our hall closet at home - but by the absence of a sink. A sink, you guys. They were nice enough to put a full-length mirror directly across from the toilet, though. Because we all want to watch ourselves do our business, right? Is it the new 'hip' thing to not have a sink in public restrooms? I guess I'm really ungodly boring and unhip, because I did my thing and left feeling really gross.

I am like WTH there aint no signs over there... but there is a non descript brown door on a brown building that is just about as flat and drab as anything you have ever seen... well lo and behold... you enter into a dungeon. The lighting is so low that I almost walked right into the hostess with the mostess podium as my eyes adjusted.

But I recently went again for dinner. \n\nEnvironment: really cool. Like super hip. It is in a shady part of the tenderloin but once you get inside it's very \"cool\". You can eat inside, in an enclosed outdoor space or even next to the pool. And the pool really makes you want to stay in their hotel. Or reserve a cabana for a party.\n\nFood: There was something about the hamburger I didn't like. Maybe Worcester sauce. But this is definitely a preference thing.\nThey did make me a michelada and I have gone to so many places In the city that don't know how to make a michelada. So this was a HUGE +++\n\nService: great service. Friendly, helpful, and quick. \n\nI would come back here and definitely need to throw a cabana pool party.", "author": "Julianna I."}

Unfortunately, there are just too many things I cannot forgive.\n\nThe food is over thought, it feels pretentious.  There's 2 too many flavors in every dish.  It's like fine dining from 20+ years ago -- when over complicating things was still cool.\n\nThe portions are tiny.  I mean seriously, if you have any kind of appetite, you are better off eating somewhere else before you come here.  I had an app and a main, and I was still starving.\n\nI do love the decor.  It's dark, leathery, with shelves stacked with old records.  Cool lighting and great entranceway.\n\nIt's also hugely expensive.  Two drinks, two apps, two mains, $150 for 2.

My meal at Chambers was memorable thanks to both. I joined a rowdy group of ladies here for a dinner that included wine, tater tots (with bacon dust!), grit \"fries\", and the sassiest (in a good way) server I've had in a long while. In fact, I wanted to be BFFs with our server because she was the awesomest. It all started with her calling me \"boo\" which is, strangely enough, a nickname I use for my 2 year old son. \n\nThe interior is the coolest. If I had a lot of money, an interior decorator, and unlimited space I'd invite said decorator to Chambers and command \"Make me a room like this, please!\"\n\nThe cocktail list is creative, the food menu is small, but delicious with a Southern hint, and the service is extraordinary. Chambers is a little oasis in its corner of the Tenderloin and well worth the trip there. Without a doubt I'll be back!", "author": "Tiffany N."}

The shelves are lined with old records and there's a fireplace and the place is dripping with cool art/furniture. I would love to come back just for drinks and chill out with friends.\n\nWe came here for date night on Friday and the place was already packed. The attached hotel hosted an art exhibit and there was a Gatsby themed party going on simultaneously so the place was rocking. There was a large party seated right behind us and they were being super loud so it was a bit hard to have a intimate romantic dinner, but I was told that the place isn't normally this crazy. \n\nWe shared three appetizers and the burger. I also tried two of their cocktails (hibiscus drink and the spicy cucumber). The spicy cucumber had a pretty strong kick, which I liked, but is a bit on the sweet side (to be fair, what is sweet to me is probably just right for most people). The hibiscus drink was just right, with the right amount of tartness.\n\nWe shared the chicken liver pate, smoked pork belly and sizzling kobe tri-tip. The live pate was divine! It didn't taste organ-y and had a wonderful port flavor. I couldn't taste the leeks, but I think the leeks were cooked down so much that it melted in with the pate. I can certainly detect a bit of sweetness in the pate that's most likely from the leeks.I would order that again. \n\nThe smoked pork belly was disappointing. I expected it to be more buttery, but it seemed to be blanched and sliced up pork belly sitting on some wood chips. Granted, the presentation was great and the house made kimchi (more like pickled cabbage and less kimchi) gave the dish some kick, but it couldn't salvage the blandness of the pork.\n\nThe sizzling tri-tip was another winner, even though the serving size was tiny. The meat was so tender. There was a nice little slaw and dipping sauce that came with the dish, but I could just eat the meat plain because it was such a nice cut and so flavorful.I wish they would have an entree sized portion!\n\nThe burger was very good, too. The patty was juicy and the onion jam gave it even more flavor. The challah bun had nice texture and soaked up any extra juice from the meat. The fries were pretty average and there weren't much of it, but overall, it was a good dish.\n\nI want to come back and try out their other cocktails. Hopefully it won't be so crowded next time and I can take a pic of the BE AMAZING sign.", "author": "Alice W."}

The staff is super friendly and accommodating not to say attractive too. So it is a place worth visiting even on its own, but I cannot say the same about the food, which was in many ways underwhelming at least what we chose for breakfast which was pork belly and soft scrambled eggs.

The servers were friendly and helpful.\n\nI ordered sparkling water (the drinks sounded great, but I'm a lightweight) and opted for the Tai Snapper.  OMG, who would have thought to put sushi rice with peppery snapper, buttery leeks, baby daikon, turnips, bokchoy and beurre blanc?  Each flavor, succinctly different, played well together.  I was amazed.\n\nNext came coffee.  Cute presentation in its own little silver pot with enough for two cups.  \n \nI asked the waiter which dessert he recommended.  I was torn between the Chocolate Panna Cotta and Carmelized Apple.  He said hands down, the Carmelized Apple.  I hesitated due to someone else's review, but decided to trust.  I was glad I did.  The dish came out, thinly sliced apples and crumble, hot out of the oven, next to homemade maple ice cream atop a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds and crunchy diced apples.  The plate was painted with a swipe of apple cider gelee.

The veggies were fresh and crisp, though the rich pork belly lacked a crispy crunch. \n\n*CHAMBER'S BURGER w/ Pork Belly, Heirloom Tomato, Smoked Red Onion, Carmody Cheese, Whole Grain Aioli & Thyme Kennebec Fries ($12 + $3 for the pork belly) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O2y-CyIsJz8f_6f-MJuKIA?select=FOJZim5TPLPg9tRg0zdmRw\nBetween the soft toasted bun was a thick patty perfectly cooked to a medium and was succulently juicy. The carmody cheese added a creamy milkiness, the tomato and onions gave it freshness while the whole grain aioli gave the burger a nice creamy tang.

The white chocolate sauce gave an extra layer of decadence while the strawberry compote gave a nice sweet tartness to help balance the richness. \n\nS E R V I C E\nFriendly but lacked attentiveness since Chambers was a full house on a Friday night.

The design team definitely did an AMAZING transformation to the former Bambuddha Lounge. Chamber's vintage glam decor is super swanky and a place you would imagine to be in Hollywood or NYC; NOT in crackhead central that's for sure. Shelves of old records lined the walls in the main dining room giving you that feeling like you're dining in someone's living room. The lounge area has plushy sofas and ottomans perfect for mingling and having a drink. There's also a poolside patio with several cabanas and a fire feature. \n\nA live DJ comes in at 10 PM and currently plays Soul/Loungey music. There are 2 bars and drinks didn't seem to be a problem to get though we only stayed till 10:20 PM. Chamber's attracts the Marina-type crowd and Hipsters in the masses if that's your thing. Chambers is definitely a place to check out and start your night off but not a place I can spend the whole night at (I like to dance).  \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking; beware of street cleaning signs. This area is pretty sketchy at night, so I highly suggest taking a cab here instead.  \n\nAt the back bar, lighted bulbs spell out \"BE AMAZING\". LOVE IT!

It was about 1030am, so we were expecting a long wait for a table amongst the saturday morning brunch crews. Fortunately, we beat the crowds. There were lots of tables open. The host was nice, we let him know we didn't have a reservation--but with a smile he said not a problem and he walked us to their patio seating. Before walking out the patio we were able to walk through the restaurant space. You're definitely transported in to a great vintage time period. You feel like you're in a record library, with sleek, masculine vintage furniture. Pretty awesome design choice. \n\nOutside, you get the enjoy the ambience of the Pheonix Hotel pool. Our server, Jahvanna was really nice. She took the time to discuss her favorite dishes on the brunch menu. She had a refreshing perspective--commenting on which dishes have the best to offer in colors, presentation, and portion size. I decided to go with the Egg Sandwich ($11), the BF decided to go with the Pork Belly ($13), and we shared the Togarashi Biscuits and Gravy ($6). \n\nBiscuits and Gravy:\nThe Togarashi Biscuits and Gravy came out first. We were a bit unsatisfied with this dish. The biscuits definitely were a bit too tough inside, though nice and crisp on the outside. It seemed like they may have been sitting around for a while. The gravy, a bit too salty, had a nice richness and thickness that I appreciate. Unfortunately, the gravy was just warm. This led it to be cold in a few minutes because we were seated outside. After a few bites and some conversation, cold biscuits and gravy just doesn't uphold a consistent enjoyable experience. \n\nEgg Sandwich: \nThe egg sandwich was delicious. The eggs were moist and seasoned just right. The focaccia had a nice crunch that together with the cool crisp butter lettuce and warm, seasoned mushrooms created a really nice combination of textures that definitely livens up an average \"egg sandwich.\" The seasonal greens had thinly peeled slices of cucumber that balanced the generous amount of salt. (They're salt happy in the kitchen).\n\nPork Belly:\nThe pork belly was fulfilling and had a nice balance of being crispy and juicy. The sauce alone had a richness that paired so well with each component of the dish--the pork belly itself, the potatoes, and the kale. We felt that eating each together with the sauce was a bit overwhelming, but overall this was our favorite dish. \n\nOverall, a nice brunch option and experience!", "author": "Ben C."}

Also has a nice covered and heated patio, where we sat poolside for brunch.\n\nI really wanted to give this place a 5 for their pork belly, but that dish is *salty*. At first glance it looks beautiful - a golden block of pork belly and two soft boiled eggs nestled in a plate of fried lolipop kale and potatoes, along with other accouterments. My first bite was of kale, salty but tasty since fried or roasted kale is best on the salty side. Pork belly was nicely cooked, tender and flavorful. Additionally, the eggs tasted unsalted relative to everything else, so I thought the saltiness of the overall dish was purposefully done so that I could balance it with the potatoes and the kale. But in hindsight the more I ate, esp the parts covered in the orange-colored sauce, the more the nice flavors turned into salt, salt and more salt. Basically the last 5 bites or so of mine felt like I was eating salt, as I hoped in vain that I could rediscover the original flavors I tasted when I first bit into the kale. In the end I think that it was the sauce  (gochujang - wikipedia: a 'fermented Korean condiment made from red chili, glutinous rice, fermented soybeans and salt') that gave things a very salty flavor. My early bites only were lightly touched by this  sauce, but the last few bites were unavoidably drenched.  I downed 3 glasses of water faster than they could refill, and would have a 4th if they poured me one. Only was able to tell the waitress about it when I was basically done, who passed it along to the chef for future reference, I can only hope! If they can tone down the saltiness, this would be an awesome dish, but right now I have to warn people about this potential salt fest.\n\nMy gf's vegetable medley was also on the saltier side (although not as extreme as mine), so it may be affecting more dishes? I hope not, because I still would love to come back to try a bunch of other yummy sounding dishes (like their soft scramble or pancake souffle), not to mention their intriguing cocktails.

Scared shitless as I dodged zombie like loud homeless... what's with the homeless in SF they're approximately 1000000 decibels louder than any other derelict person I've ever encountered?!?!?!?!\n\nThat all being said I would make that trek 1000 times knowing the gastro-treat that awaits me at Chambers!!! Kind of like a foodie Oasis in the midst of a homeless Sahara dessert. The diamond in the rough located in a neighbourhood ironically known as the Tenderloin. (Ain't nobody eating a tenderloin in this area)\n\nStopped in for Brunch with friends and had:\nEggs royale $14 - Two sous vide eggs, crispy hash browns, cold smoked salmon, mandarin hollandaise, caviar, chive, and dill all sitting on a bed of creme fresh\n\nSide of Pork Bellies - fatty, delicious and oh so bad for you YET so damn good \n\nBloody Mary - OK, I'm from Canada and we do Bloody Caesars, I can't deal with Bloody Mary's, not my bag baby.. seriously!\n\nAside from the Bloody Mary, everything else was fan-friggen tastic. Food aside, the decor of this place was awesome, I especially liked the oversized light signs and the HUGE collection of vinyl.

The drinks here are fabulous and the food takes fancy up a notch. We ordered the Fries to nibble on and was served a plate of cubed potatoes instead.

Pork belly in my belly! \n\nPer several recommendations my best friend decided to have her birthday dinner at Chambers Eat + Drink last Friday prior to the Macy's Glamorama Fashion show. This was the perfect place to start off our night.\n\nThis place is a hidden gem. From the outside this place looks sketchy... it is attached to the old Phoenix Hotel in the Tenderloin and the door is on the side of the building. When you walk in however, there is a dimmed, artsy, classy kind of ambiance. We arrived around 6:00pm during happy hour on Friday. There weren't too many tables occupied but the front bar was surrounded by young looking professionals. \n\nThe menu is short, very short and prices are mediocre. Three of us ordered the Chambers Burger ($12) with pork belly (+$3). The only thing I've tried here is the Chambers Burger but I think it might be the best thing in the menu! All three of us agreed the burger was super juicy and very aromatic. It had a heavy smokey flavor and all the extra fresh condiments complimented the taste. Ohhh and the pork belly... it is a must have if you are ordering the Chambers burger. Without the pork belly... you'll feel cheated. The seasoned fries were a little too salty yet addicting. \n\nMy best friend had the California Sea Bass ($23). She said it tasted really good to the point where she cleaned her plate- including the sauce. The Truffle and Wild Mushroom Dip was okay, it is served with chips. My friend who does not like mayonnaise was not a fan.\n\nMixed drinks seemed pretty strong and I guess we were there for the Happiest Hour of all because the two beers we ordered did not show up on the tab.\n\nService was really good. I mentioned to the waitress we only had about an hour and a half  for dinner since the show was at 8:00PM at the Orpheum (a few blocks away) and she got us out in good time. She also reminded us of drink specials and happy hour time, refilled our waters and checked on us frequently. \n\nGood food, drinks, style and class- this place has it all!", "author": "Cindy S."}

There were a few \"wth\" moments but nothing that couldn't be fixed.\n\nThe Ambiance: Don't get lost walking up and down the Eddy st in the heart of the Tenderloin district looking for this place being that it has ZERO signage outside. It is directly on the side of the Phoenix Hotel. Get a sign please. ANYWHO, The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit (very loungey), tables are a little close together. There is a restaurant section and then another portion dedicated for the actual lounge. There is outdoor seating (heated) and plenty of standing room within the hotel (motel) courtyard area.\n\n-we sat outside in the covered area. heat lamps work but there are breaks in the covering so you will feel a breeze from time to time.\n\n-The service: This is probably my main reason for the 3 star experience. Our waiter seemed a little more interested with his eye brows than providing excellent service for our table. Although he wasn't bad. He was far cry from great. He did not explain the menu and when we did have questions, his answers were a general and very flat  \"no\". Didn't offer any suggestions just said no. He did not check on us very often and when he did it was super brief and he would take off, leaving us trying to call for him to come back. \n\n-My BIGGEST gripe was with the bill. Our bill was almost $400. First he would not split it, ok fine. We gave him the bill back, itemized everything and wrote how much we wanted each card to be charged. When he brought it back, one of our guests looked at her card and realized she had been charged over $20 more than what she wrote down. Of course we went back through the bill to see what we may have forgotten and realized there were 2 items we forgot to include. Our bad. My issue is, why not tell us that the bill was short opposed to just charging the card for whatever amount? We clearly listed HOW MUCH that card was SUPPOSED to be charged. But it just went along with the lazy, laissez faire type service we had received all night. Victor was out server.\n\nThe food: I enjoyed the food. Small bites mean small bites. The Kobe steak is amazing! I had a small side salad with their champagne vinaigrette; very tasty.  I wish there were more alternatives to some of the dishes, for instance the salads. If you don't like what they have on the menu, so sad too bad lol. My side salad was just lettuce and dressing. lol\n\np.s. Take a cab or Uber. Parking SUCKS", "author": "Meghan M."}

The waitresses apologized for the delays, so I couldn't really be mad at them. The food was decent, but I'd probably just come here for just drinks next time.

The food. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed a lot of the appetizers and entrees that we ordered and yes we ordered 6 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts for the two of us. That's actually precisely my problem with the place - it's perfect for a happy hour/ post-dinner drinks & apps type of spot, but not for a legitimate sit-down dinner. The portions are simply too small, even by fine dining standards.  \n\nIt's definitely fun to sample all the apps and perhaps an entree or two along with well crafted cocktails and a fabulous group of friends. But I need more from a traditional dinner. I want to be able to order 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert and feel more than content. Chambers just doesn't cut it. \n\nHaving said that, however, here's what I recommend - truffle dip, smoked grit fries and the pork belly. I enjoyed the appetizers much more than the entrees. So I'd recommend coming to Chambers for a light dinner filled with sampling all the appetizers and drinks or a post-dinner drinking venue, definitely not a traditional coursed dinner.", "author": "Priya S."}

A friendly homeless man with a little white powdery stuff around his mouth suggested he would watch my car for me while I dined. I politely declined. \n\nTrust the menu-- small bites are not meals. Rather, small plates, tapa like, for sharing or a quick bite before the entree is served. \n\nParty of 6 for our birthday dinner. We were seated outside on a cool night with the fireplace blazing for our comfort. Cool place-- you eat and chat, drink and dine while imagining what the place looks like during the day. When you dine outside, your view is of the pool and the 70's style motel/hotel where guests filter in and out. \n\nI arrived late, so I ordered a small plate so I would get it about the same time my group had their entrees. I ordered the Smoking Pork Belly ($14), which came with tomato kimchee, pickled sweet peppers, aji amarillo chili, and scallions. Wow-- it was so good. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The spiciness of the salad perfected the pork.\n\nThe brussels sprouts were also a delight. The combination of the chorizo and lemon gave the leaves a nice balance of spicy and sweet. \n\nFrom what I understand, the rest of the table wasn't terribly in love with the burger, and the tri tip was ok. \n\nSkip the dessert. I got the caramelized apple, a hodgepodge of ingredients thrown together in a confusing combination of tastes that didn't at all blend together well.\n\nInstead, get Tequila Drink, made with Suerte reposado, agave nectar, lime, cucumber, raspberry, and mint. Homygawd. So good. I had three of them. Not kidding. We were there for awhile lol\n\nWhat I loved about Chambers was the atmosphere. Once we were finished with dinner outside, they moved us indoors.

To be honest, I was kinda scurd as we all know the Tenderloin isn't the safest of places, but oh well, you just have to walk a litttttle bit faster.  Once we walked in, I was pretty impressed - the place was SO COOL - decor was right up my alley! People were totally enjoying themselves - some there for drinks at the bar, others were enjoying din din.

We were seated in one of the booths and the backdrop was amazing!! \n\nOur waitress was really sweet and gave great suggestions.

It's too bad, I love fries. I'm sure you'll like them and I'll get them again and hope for better results.\n\nThe only negative had nothing to do with the food.

We had heard the drinks and atmosphere were awesome and wanted to check it out. Outside of the restaurant is a pretty sketch neighborhood be warned but inside is very chic and sophisticated. My one friend got there a little bit before us and by the time we had gotten there we were ready for cocktails. I would say it took our server (Maria) ten minutes to greet us and ask for drinks. When I say greet us \"Hi, did you want a cocktail?\".... Didn't introduce her name (only know her name from the receipt)... Didn't ask how we were or if we had been there before... Totally rude. Mind you 2/3 of us were servers in our past so.... Yes we are going to judge. Drinks came out and were fabulous... Two of us had the vodka drink which was strong and refreshing! If you like basil get it! My other friend had a Malbec, which she enjoyed. After the drinks were dropped off we didn't see her again for another 20 minutes when she then took our order. We got the tri tip, polenta, tater tots, burger and quinoa salad. We all enjoyed everything... All delicious! The taller African American man who was the food runner was very kind and helpful! Shout out to him. We got another round of drinks and had also asked for ice for our water. She looked at us like we were completely putting her out.. Again rude. We wanted one more drink but had enough of our server so we asked for our check which she of course dropped off quick. My friends and I look young and I guess naive, but when it comes to service at a restaurant and tipping we are always overly generous. This server however did not deserve that. Perhaps she could start with a smile for one. We got up and went to the bar and got more drinks. Bartender was quick and efficient. We then took our drinks outside on the pool deck and enjoyed the scenery! The pool and surroundings are very retro chic! We also took a picture in front of the Be Amazing at the bar. I'm giving this place a 3/5 because drinks, food and atmosphere were great. Server sucked. \n\n\nUpdate: Soon after my original post I was contacted by the manager of Chambers, Isabel.

Salads: the quinoa salad right now is delightful, recently they had a gem salad with salmon which blew me away. \n\nTonight I had a delicious and spicy Bloody Mary, the carrot soup (which is un-fucking-believable) and the bacon wrapped medjool dates with some amazing complicated sauce. \n\nThe thing about this review is I'm leaving all of the details out which go into the genius dishes at chambers. Don't even get me started on the ever changing homemade sorbets... I could go on forever. \n\nImpress a date or go for drinks and food with friends when you want to really enjoy eating and drinking.

Among their signature cocktails, I like the \"vodka drink\" here which is essentially a basil gimlet I guess but they are tasty and deceivingly helpful for cocktail conversations. I also enjoyed the \"bramble\" - a Bombay Sapphire gin concoction with blackberries and mint. It is a refreshing cocktail that is well mixed and not too sweet at all. \n\nBut the atmosphere is where Chambers excels. The poolside area is a nice place to chill if it's not too cold out.

The situation outside is quite interesting, with Chambers' outside patio nestled right next to the very Americana pool area of neighboring motel, it almost gave me the sense of eating in LA or in an old-time hollywood movie. Inside the music was comfortable with the right amount of jazz.\n\nService was polite, but not very attentive (we were given desserts without new sets of clean utensils). \n\nFood, oh the food gets one star at best.\nI ordered the Eggs Royale (eggs sous vide with mandarin hollandaise on a bed of crispy hash browns and creme fraiche, with trout and caviar garnish). First things first, the hashbrowns were stale. One bite in and I was consumed by the taste of stale oil. The lil coated my tongue with a sticky film and left a terrible aftertaste. The two eggs sous vide proved to be runny, but I wasn't supplied with any form of carbs to soak up the delicious egg yolks. (Hashbrown to eggs ratio was intensely off-balanced). The trout and caviar were good. But rather standard and boring. All the components of this dish were either cold or lukewarm. Definitely a do-not-order.\n\nChambers really likes its Asian fusion. I could not get down the list without seeing some sort of asian ingredient randomly thrown into a traditionally Western dish, which is totally fine, given that it had to be done correctly. I only tried a bit of the pork belly, and that was well cooked, tender, though slightly on the sweeter side. Usually in Asian cooking we refrain from cooking the thick pork belly fats so long that it loses its texture, because it ends up with the texture of pudding and nobody wants fat pudding in their food.\n\nThe souffle pancake were horrendous. First of all, it was undercooked. Second, they added way too much egg. The centers were gooey, reminiscent of the insides of an omelette (which souffles definitely should NOT look like), and tasted like an overly watered down omelette (which souffles should NOT taste like either). The outer edges were neither soft nor crunchy. Caramel vanilla ice cream and sauteed apples on top were adequate, nothing too exciting. Raspberry bourbon sauce on the side lacked in depth.\n\nWould not visit again. I rarely leave a meal feeling cheated, and I did today with Chambers.", "author": "Chia L."}

If I were judging Chambers solely on presentation, it gets 5 stars.\n\nThe restaurant didn't look busy from the outside, but there were no tables left at 7PM on a Friday, so my friend and I sat at the bar. As per usual, we asked for the sweetest/fruitiest cocktail and the bartender recommended Number 13, which was a fizzy and unmemorable drink. We ordered a few small bites to accompany our drinks. All the food is presented gorgeously and creatively, and I guess that's how they justify a price markup on otherwise mediocre food.\n\n- Truffle Ricotta ($13): Don't miss the mushrooms hiding under the block of ricotta! \n\n- Smoking Pork Belly ($14): The 5 slices of pork belly came on a mini grill with a bed of smoldering wood chips; this presentation made me feel Very Important. I liked how the pork belly balanced with the pickled peppers/kimchee \"salad.\"\n\n- Tator Tots ($9): Have you seen rectangular tator tots stacked in a pyramid and sprinkled with bacon dust, to be dipped in a pork remoulade (to be mixed with some kind of powder cheese)? If you haven't, you should order this just so you can take photos and make all your Instagram followers jealous.

The chef here definitely does not feel constrained by convention. I had the hangover hash, which comes with pastrami, potatoes, and eggs, and it was definitely both good and inventive.

It is not a guaranteed known spot, even for some of the most seasoned visitors / locals in the hood. The most important thing is this place is worth a visit for all sorts of occasions.\n\nInside the place is dimly lit, intimate, and a perfect spot for a casual date. It's comfy, lounge worthy, and versatile enough to serve as a place to quench one's alcoholic thirst or satisfy some hunger pangs. It is far cry from anything else remotely close in the hood and like eyes that can finally see light, it does take a blink or two to adjust in here. Once acclimated, there is almost always a sexy vibe in here.\n\nI've done more happy hours at CE+D and their signature ($10) cocktails are killer. The Pisco Punch seems to be pretty popular. I love Pisco as it is, but when combined with a little lime, lemon, and honey liquer, this drink becomes its own little glass of epic. Cinnamon bitters, ginger beer, lime and rum make up my other favorite, the Cusco, which is sweet and incredibly potent. Their drink menu is enough for all palates, but is most importantly well made.\n\nThe dinner options are pricey, but that's to be expected at a place like this. While I'm a fan of the bar bites (truffle dip and chicken liver pate anyone?), the rest of the menu is a collection of small plates and entrees. Out of the \"big bites\" I am a fan of the pancetta wrapped chicken roulade, which is succulent and savory and roughly $19 in change. If one decides its tapa time, shoot for the crab croquettes ($12) and smoking hamachi ($15). While many folks are intrigued with the foie gras torchon ($14) and and kobe beef tips ($14), I find them to be semi-pricey relative to portion size.\n\nIn the end, Chambers Eat + Drink is a really solid venue featuring a wide array of drinks and bites, and the perfect place for a group mingle session or a cuddle worthy date.

The day prior she texted to confirm for 9 people rather than 11 and then proceeded to tell me that to accommodate for 11, she would have to sit us at 3 separate tables and at 15 minute intervals to help offset the pressure placed on the kitchen. I felt that she acted in an unprofessional manner and we ended up suffering for her mistake. I wanted to cancel our reservation, but could not as we were 1 day from the event and it would be very difficult to find another restaurant to accommodate us. I do not feel that this place is good for large groups. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, I was prepared to be disappointed. However, we had an excellent waiter (Marcus) who was very kind and attentive. In addition, the food and drinks were very good. The pork belly and burger were great. \n\nOverall, I would rate our experience with 3 stars.", "author": "Radha C."}

The decor is homey for a trendy hipster San Franciscan, with vinyl records lining it's walls and artwork of epic proportions adorning it's fireplace and hallways.  The \"69\" pool adds a touch of, dare I say class, to this already down and dirty location surrounded by the crack-addicts of the trendy-loin. DO NOT let that deter you.\n\nSmall plates are a good way to start your meal, but from what I've tasted I'd recommend skipping the small bites and head right to the big daddies of the night.  The waffle chip, truffle dip is a easy pass as the way to salty twice baked Ruffles adorn a plate of sour cream \"truffle\" dip served in a container making it hard to actually dip the chips. Eating the Crab Croquette was the saving grace as we watched the sizzling Kobe trip-tip smoke on top of a heated rock.  Nice touch, but I expected a masseuse to begin walking on my back while Enya played in the background.  Music was great though and eased you into the fun-times-with-friends mood.\n\nOverall the space is great.  Just get inside otherwise you'll quickly second-guess your dining decision and safety.  Make sure to grab a drink as they were the highlights of the night and walk around the pool while feeling important at the fire-lit waterfall table.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.\n\n3.5 stars.", "author": "Kevin J."}

I loved every item with the exception of the mascarpone filled strawberry dessert. It's not that it wasn't good, it just isn't my kind of dessert. My heart belongs to all things chocolate.

So glad I did because this place did NOT disappoint!\n\nAmbience is trendy, although a bit on the dark side. I could see how this place would be fun at night! Crowd is definitely a younger crowd. I say this place is less suitable for families (ie: my screaming yet adorable bundle of 10 month joy).\n\nNow on to the food: we ordered several different dishes, all were AMAZEBALLS!  The hubby got the Hangover Hash. It came beautifully presented and it must have been good because he devoured it in under 5 minutes. My dad ordered the Eggs Royale, which looked delish because I enjoy anything that comes with smoked fish. I ordered a bunch of stuff, being the undercover fatty that I am. For starters, I had a side of pork belly hash (please don't tell the other Jews), a side of marble potato home fries and Spiced French Toast. OH EMM GEE. The french toast was melt in your mouth good. Like the kind of good where you have to keep in your moans as to not scare the other patrons good. The pork belly was fresh and perfectly made. The potatoes were just aiight. We all also ordered fresh squeezed orange juice. I love a place that offers fresh squeezed juices. Juices from concentrate just don't cut it. Yes, I am a juice snob. \n\nAnyway, after licking my plate clean, I felt satisfied. When the bill came, I was pleasantly surprised that it was all reasonable priced. \n\nSo moral of the story: if you want a cool spot for brunch that'll give you mouth-gasms... and a place that is easy to make reservations, Chambers is your go to spot.

Not for someone breaking in, but just terrible drivers in general. Second, I saw on the website that it was part of the Phoenix Motel (hotel?) and I don't remember a bar here. Umm...no signage.

But don't worry, if you're coming in with street clothes (like I did one time), you're still welcome in this trendy little spot. Careful when looking for this spot. The building isn't quite marked on the outside, but as long as you see the little pool/outdoor lounge area, you'll be good.\n\nThis place may initially look small inside, but just keep walking. You'll find yourself in the lounge area very soon. Plenty of seating in here as well. There's also a nice influx of people here, but it's never crowded. A very comfortable place indeed. You'll initially be struck by the lit up \"BE AMAZING\" letters right behind the bar. I gather that if you have enough cocktails, you shall indeed \"be amazing\" (or something else on the other end of the spectrum, but that's outside the scope of this positive review).\n\nThe drinks? Awesome! All of your standard cocktail joint drinks can be found here. From the most girly girl (I admit it, mojito's are one of my favs) to the gentlemen's drinks (rusty nail, anyone?), they got em here. They also have a good selection of house specialties, so be sure to give those a try. One of the bartenders made me a experimental drink with rum and cilantro. Twas off the hook, to be sure. No disappointment when it comes to libations here.\n\nNext time I come, I gotta try the eats here as they sounds really good. All in all, I like this place a lot.

I don't trust easily and last time I entrusted someone to surprise me with a mixed drink, it had been spiked with Fireball and that's seriously grounds for being defriended on Facebook.  So when I opted to have James create a drink based on a very ambiguous description of what I typically like, I had my doubts because I have absurdly high standards for cocktails.  The opposite happened and I honestly don't think I could have crafted a more perfect cocktail for myself. \n\nUpon first impression, it seemed like a high-profile bar and I noticed the brightly lit \"Be Amazing\" sign paired with the leather couches, so at first I was like, fuck me, the night's going to be long.  However, when we finally got to know our bartender a little bit, I discovered that he is a psychic, ingenious bastard.  I could sing gospel of his unnamed cocktails.  Whereas my partner likes his drinks to be on the side of tasting like pure tar extract and then put hot on a grill, I prefer my drinks to be not at all smoky, savory, or ashy.  Somehow, he was able to mix drinks that seemed to fit our personalities to a T.  \n\nWe didn't order any food so I can't speak for that but I would highly suggest coming here for a few drinks.  I was already a few drinks in before I had anything to drink at Chambers, so my only regret is that I didn't have the alcohol capacity to hold any more drinks.  Another downside was the music.  It sounded like the worst type of dubstep music you've ever heard but played backwards.  I wanted to throw all sharp objects I could find at the DJ.\n\nI left feeling thoroughly impressed.  I'm disheartened that James does not live in Seattle.  Although I'm not horribly against blackmail and extortion to get my way.  His talents alone compensates for the shitty crowd this bar attracts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-27", "description": "Came here for a goodbye party for our friend Eric B.\n\nThe last time i was here, this place was called Bambuddah Lounge. This place is way different than I remember, but for the better!\n\nTater Tots - these are more like a cross between hash browns and tater tots in the sense that they are about finger length, perfectly browned with a nice texture that was crispy with nice coarse shavings mixed with some softer potato bits.  It comes with pork remoulade and bacon dust. I felt the bacon dust was more gimmicky than anything, since there was plenty of porky salty flavor. The remoulade by the way was freaking awesome; creamy, sweat salty smokey. We shoulda asked for more of this. Had this come with eggs, it would be a nice bacon eggs and hash reimagined.\n\nSmoking Pork Belly - they treat the belly well. One of the things i noticed first about the taste was that it was very clean. It's kind of hard to describe the \"clean\" vs \"dirty\" tastes of pork belly, but i guess the best way to describe it is it wasn't ultra gamey. It had a nice crunch on the skin layer, and the fat wasn't overwhelming, while the meat was juicy and tender. The kimchee was different; not spicy at all, but more sweet and red peppery. A good classic acidic balance for the fattiness of the pork. \n\nSizzling Kobe Tri Tip - a perfectly rare side dish that comes sizzling on the plate. Good quality grade and marbling, with just enough salt to accentuate the flavor. Ultra tenderness and the reduction was good if you wanted to have an earthier addition to the dish, which was a good change up. The pickled veggies were a good palate cleanser, especially since this dish is fatty but delicious. While this was kind of redundant of our other app, it still was good and worth getting, and you honestly can't go wrong with either\n\nSmoked Grit Fries - Grits! Its not just for breakfast!  This reminded me of fried polenta. The grits were nice and firm, similar to polenta. The tomato aioli went really well with this and actually made me think of polenta, and provided a nice change of perspective as far as how other foods can be analogous when executed a certain way. The BBQ spice added a layer of sweet/smoky.\n\nTruffle Ricotta - without the truffle this dish is just ok. I am naturally biased against ricotta. I am also not to much of a fan of focaccia outside of the olive oil/red wine vinegar, or toasted like a pizza variety. The focaccia was lightly warmed, and airy, and the ricotta also didn't have to much flavor. Add the truffle and wild mushrooms and you get something that was a nice and light dish. \n\nChambers Burger with Pork Belly - this was a solid burger of high quality. They use a challah bun, which I think has become my favorite bun for burgers since its nice and eggy, and absorbs a lot of the juices. The meat is of great quality and they cooked it a perfect medium rare. The cheese was very melty, and the smokiness from the onion brought out a deeper flavor of the cheese and made it feel almost like a BBQ burger but not really. The pork belly is the same as whats in the appetizer, and I honestly could have gone without this.", "author": "Marc T."}

I've only come for drinks before so I was delighted to see how bright the restaurant was so early in the day. We were seated outside by the pool. The BF's parents thought it was funny to see people swimming by the pool with their dog and commented on the hip \"kung-fu hip hop\" music playing as being very artsy. \n\nThe menu appeared simple at first glance, but upon reading the descriptions you could tell each entree was an adventure in itself. For instance my BF and his dad ordered the Eggs Royale which came with sous vide eggs, smoked trout and caviar! That doesn't even really begin to describe the dish, but really!? I give props to any place that will sous vide their eggs. I had the French Toast which came in the perfect portion and had the best bourbon glaze to pair with the fruit compote. SO GOOD!\n\nAlso, our waiter Marcus was incredible. He was very accommodating, especially through our many french press coffee refills and especially when we let him know the cream wasn't looking good. \n\nDefinitely coming back for mo brunch.

This place is gorgeous, packed, and has a diverse and pretty people crowd.  Bf & my friends that have been here when it was Bambuddha said the place looks so much better & different now. My belated birthday celebration almost didn't happen here but so glad that it did!  It was a little frustrating after calling three times & talking to two or three different people to find out that after I made it explicit that my party of thirteen plus was just going to have drinks and not eat, so I was wondering if it would be possible to reserve a table solely for that.  The first person I talked to assured me it was.  But then as the day got closer I got two reservation confirmation calls stating dinner reservations, so I called back & the girl told me that she found out from a manager that table reservations were only for dinner.  I called back after a little bit & asked to speak to a manager, luckily Isabelle was a manager & she answered the phone.  She reassured me that everything will be alright & that I will have a table for the next night.  \n\nWhen I walked in with a couple friends & my bf, the hostess got Isabelle right away after seeing my reservation & she showed me around asking me what table/area I'd prefer.  We decided on a big table by the walkway which across was the door to the pool outside.  While the back lounge area is absolutely *AMAZING* (if you've been here you get it), it was way too crowded & stuffy.  While we were waiting for the table to clear up she told us to go to the bar & got us 4 drinks on the house.  I enjoyed my Pisco Punch though I asked for it to be a little more on the sweeter than the sour side.  Just like Chambers, Pisco is so hot right now!  \n\nOne handful of friends that came in a little after us said that they tried to get in through the lounge exit but the bouncer said that they were at capacity & that some people were even trying to slip him some money.  Just go through the front restaurant entrance & you'll have no problem getting in.\n\nAs the night went on we kept seeing yummy food pass by us & luckily my friends that came later on indulged in some food, so I got to try some tasty truffle fries.  I did underestimate how many people would show up, so next time lounge couch for sure!  Did I go on an off night because, yes I know it's the TL, but I didn't really see any shady people on the streets!  Loved Chambers, will be back to eat & drink again.

Wait until you're actually seated to get a round of bottomless mimosas going. \n\nI split the spiced french toast and eggs royale with my friend. Both were delicious! I've never had smoked trout before and was anticipating a very strong fishy flavor, but that wasn't the case at all. As for the french toast, it was sweet and filling without being overwhelming.

Everything about this place just oozes cool. From the mismatched vintage furniture to the rows of old-school vinyl that dots its marrow, it's gotta be one of the hippest rooms in the entire city. \n\nThis space used to be BackFlip and Bambuddha back in the day, and while I didn't spend too much time enjoying either of the previous iterations of this space, I can confidently say that Chambers Eat + Drink trumps the three in vibe, taste, and thirst. Vibe-wise, again, you're dining in one of the most modish rooms in the city, complete with attractive patrons and servers, and great music streaming throughout the concourse. On the food tip, I have yet to have anything short of exceptional. The seafood salad starter is a light and refreshing way to tip off the meal, the lobster ravioli is house made and perfect for satisfying your craving for carbs, and the seared tuna with asparagus, morels, and olive oil mashed potatoes is equally remarkable to boot. \n\nFor those who view quantity as the signifier of a quality meal... you may be a bit disappointed, as most of the entrees are fairly small. However, I'm more of the mindset that I don't need a dump truck full of food have a good time, so the portions are perfectly suited to how I'm accustomed to dining. Just enough to leave fulfilled, with emphasis on great taste and imaginative fare. Could you really ask for anything better? \n\nThe service tends to be somewhat slow at times, but it's never without a knowledgeable smile. The staff is great at answering questions about food/wine pairings, and they're quick to suggest house favorites on the mixed cocktail side of things as well. Most definitely worth bookmarking as a new hot date spot, or even just a swanky weekend hang for you and a group of friends.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

So yes there were many things I shouldn't done that night but checking out Chambers wasn't one of them\n.\nLocated in a hotel you would miss the bar and dancefloor part of this area if you weren't looking for it. Its also located in the middle of the tenderloin so you better be looking for it and not just wandering around this area. Anyone that lives down here you know your way around and you know the loin isn't that bad but all places can be bad when you are drunk and its 1am so watch your wallet and purse.\n\nThere was a line to get in but once it I was pleasantly surprised by the inside. There were a couple bars in the small establishment as well as a dj booth and some vip areas that were hosting various birthday parties and celebrations. I came with a large group of about ten people after spending some time dancing at Swig and wanting to keep the night going. \n\nThe place is well let and the music was really good. It was a mix of top 40 dance and hip hop and techno. I danced with the various people I came with and most of the parties there danced in their own groups on the dancefloor which is positioned oddly in the middle of the place. So you literally walk into the dance floor when you enter the door. Get to dancing or gtfo out. I like that in my dance bars. The drinks were decent but nothing to write home about.\n\nPut it this way. If I had to go out in the tenderloin for some reason and I couldn't make it to Polk, or union square or market or soma or mission or northbeach. Then I would totally check out chambers. If I had any other option I wouldn't. I hope that make sense. Silly drinks and dancing to be had. Location is try at your own risk.", "author": "Nick R."}

Hundreds of vinyl records line book shelves, ridiculously cool lighting swoops over you like curious birds and the staff breathes an air of mellowness and confidence that can only come from the fact that they know they have figured out how to make a great restaurant.  One expects John Travolta to pop out, swipe two fingers across his eyes and bring you a cocktail or Quentin Tarantino to push the button on your e-cigarette.

We waited for our table in the bar area, we went to check out the other side where the chambers sign is located but there was a private party, so we couldn't go through, that's ok though an addition to excuses for me to come again. They specialize in cocktails, however the bartender that made our drinks was not very warm or inviting, more like he didn't want to make our drinks or hated his job but I'll let that pass, as the rest of the night was great. Finally got seated, ordered another drink finished up our topic of gossip at that moment, then went over the menu. We ordered a lot of small bites, the waitress asked us if we wanted to order more as the regular menu was going to end and late night menu was going to start. We looked at the entree section and decided to just keep to small plates then asked to take a look at the late night menu to see if anything was not on there that we wanted to order from the reg menu while we still could but the late night menu still offered most of the small plates and sides. The waitress was attentive, very nice and informative of drinks and food. She came to check on us now and then and didn't rush our hour and a half of eating, drinking and catching up. I definitely am coming back with the bf so he can experience chambers.\n\nAs for the food:\nChicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 - The quail egg is to be mixed before smearing it on the crostini. Livery flavor but taste good that when the crostini were done I continued to eat it off the spoon.\n\nSizzling Kobe tri-tip - This was great, just make sure you dip it in the sauce and top it with the pickled veggies. What makes it great is not the food itself but the presentation, comes still cooking on a stone. If you like your meat more on the rare side make sure to eat it right when it gets to your table, or it cooks to medium.\n\nSmoking pork belly - Just as the Kobe, presentation is what made this dish. Found myself making my bites with more kimchee to belly ratio, as the belly was a bit salty.\n\nCreamy polenta - This dish was opposite of the Kobe and pork belly, no fancy presentation but delicious. The polenta itself was creamy and flavorful but adding a piece of the tempura'd maitake mushrooms to the bite brought it to a new level. My favorite dish of the night.\n\nSmoked grit fries - Too gritty and flavorless even after dunking and drenching it into the sauce. This was the only dish that was not finished off. \n\nOut of the 5 dishes, will for sure order the p\u00e2t\u00e9, Kobe and polenta again..", "author": "Candice B."}

I made reservations at 8pm and hopped on the bus down to meet my date. The neighborhood is so sketch, that I told him I'd wait for him inside. I sat at the bar and grabbed one of their (numbered) drinks and once my friend arrived was seated at a nice cozy booth. We decided to share 2 small plates and a 3rd large plate. I scrolled Yelp really quick to see what other reviewers had suggested in terms of food. We chose the smoking salmon which was amazingly awesome and presented quite nicely, the PB&LT aka Pork Belly/ Lettuce/Tomato. Both were really good. The 3rd dish was the fish which was prepared perfectly. For dessert I just had to have the carrot cake. I'm a huge carrot cake person. To my dismay, it came out like a deconstructed carrot cake, almost like a carrot cake brownie. Sigh. Not so great. \n\nI suggested coming here to try out their drinks, grab some bites and lounge around. Service was a little mixed.

The patty was thinner and the bun felt like a straight up sara lee hamburger bun. It was still good...just not amazing like i remembered. I was underwhelmed.\n\nThe most disappointing thing though were the tater tots. When i order tots, i want classic small tots i can just throw in my mouth. These were more like potato bricks.

Chambers is not particularly well marked, and the large, heavy door doesn't convince you that you've found a safe haven. \n\nHOWEVER - it's awesome in there.

On this particular Saturday night (as I suspect most Saturday nights are here), the line is pretty big.  Maybe 30 people were standing in line waiting for this place.  Once inside, it was really packed (no surprise there), and this place would be that much better if there was a dance floor since the music was pretty good.\n\nOverall, a good spot, and yes -- I guess you can check out the pool from the bar/restaurant, too.

Luckily they were able to seat us anyway. \n\nRight when we walked in, i swear I was in a time warp and went into the past. The decor is old fashioned, records on the wall, retro lighting...super cute. This restaurant is located/attached to the Phoenix hotel, which fed off a Palm Springs kind of vibe. They sat our group of 4 outside near the hotel's pool. This is where the ambiance was weird, because the hotel's style is very apartment-like. There were girls laying out, kids all around, and this woman was just breast feeding her child out in the open, no cover up. Literally..wtf? lol.\n\nOrdered the Chamber's burger. That smoked onion marmalade is what made that burger. I enjoyed my brunch order very much. My friend's food also looked visually amazing. They have a great brunch menu.", "author": "Darlene B."}

One of my girlfriends and I had our early Christmas dinner here along with reservations which was easy. But we had to wait at the bar while our table was setting up, we asked the female bartender for recommendation on the drinks (there goes the minus star). IMO, She did not want to help us with our order better yet provide recommendations. As a bartender, you would want to guide and provide recommendations for your customers to get drink orders and tip (am I right?), well, from my experience here, the female bartender was careless to take orders and definitely not inviting or vibrant as most bartenders should be.\n\n Anyways, after the rude awakening, we intended to go into the area with the marked \"Be Amazing\" sign, it was booked for a special occasion (understandable), we asked a wait staff to see if we're able to go in there afterwards, one wait staff just shrugged it off and was snotty (for no apparent reason) but luckily another staff member made sure to ask when the party was leaving so we can go in there (thx u). Overall, two horrible customer service BUT our waiter was super friendly and the hostess was friendly too.\n\nFood wise\n- Average\n- overpriced\n- Tiny portions\n- Still hungry after dinner\n\nWe ordered the Brussels sprouts, burger with pork belly, chicken liver pate, tater tots with bacon.

I have heard really great things from friends and knew I needed to check out the iconic Phoenix Hotel. With some friends visiting from out of town I knew this would be the perfect time to go. \n\nI made a reservation that morning and it was no issue sitting a table of 6 outside by the pool. The whole decor was amazing, I loved the the old bookshelf and the the various kinds of tables throughout the restaurant. But my favorite part was the outside patio, with the bright colored hotel room doors and outside furniture, the pool and the funky sculptures I knew this place was right up our alley (regardless of the fact it's located in the Tenderloin).\n\nSince it was a beautiful Saturday in SF, we decided to do the bottomless mimosas. What a steal, especially since we love our morning cocktails. Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses were never empty. \n\nAnd then there is the food... Let me say this again, WOW. My friend visiting and I shared the egg-in-a-hole (4 stars) and asked for the bacon crunchy, which is a must in my book. The brioche bread was amazing the side salad was extremely refreshing. We also shared the Pork Belly (which is the reason why I had to write-up a post 5+ stars). HOLY YUM!! This was probably the best brunch dish I have had in SF. The crispy kale, the spicy gochujang and garlic potatoes combined with the running soft boiled eggs was absolutely TO DIE FOR. I'm not the biggest Polk Belly fan but this was good! I also tried my friends Eggs Royale (4.5 stars) which was an awesome play of eggs Benedict and lox. \n\nI will 100% be back and will be telling all my friends about Chambers.", "author": "Talia R."}

Brunch starts at 10am on Sat.  Not bad because it's not one of those SF brunch places where you wait a really long time or love brunch so much you wake up before 9 to not wait in line.  So Chambers definitely gets a plus for the ability to make reservations.  However with that being said, this place is kind of like Foreign Cinema in my opinion because the food is ...overrated and not so great.  \n\nI gravitated toward the souffle pancake because you don't see that often.  It takes 15 minutes to prep so if you know you want it, you should order it ahead of time.  However, when it came out, it wasn't all that.  Think an extra fluffy pancake (1 inch thick) and double the cost of any other brunch place in SF.  It comes with a side of ice cream which I totally liked instead of the typical whipped cream.  Creative, but not worth the whatever $12 I paid.\n\nFriends got the pork belly hash and some egg scramble.  While the presentation was beautiful, the food was sparse and the taste was mediocre.  I think they try too hard to make creative dishes and miss the flavor.  \n\nI rather get a traditional brunch at all the other awesome SF brunch places like Mission Beach, Butler & Chef or Brenda's.  Heck even toast and coffee at the Mill would have been better at a fraction of the price.\n\nPros:\nThey service their coffee in a french press, which lasted about 6 cups.  Coffee was decent.

It feels so rockstar and vintage but not in an overbearing sort of way.\n\nSERVICE: It took a weirdly long time for the hostess to appear after we walked in. But after that, our waiter was great - definitely gave us enough time for deciding and chatting. The timing of bringing out food was a bit strange, as it felt like we were waiting for the fourth dish for a while after the first three.", "author": "Kailyn G."}

I went for the first time in Feb 2013 and have been back several other times!! \n\nFirst off do not judge the place just because it is in the Tenderloin. The moment you step in, it will blow your mind away. The front room is the restaurant. This place has style. It's a place you can take someone on a take to, or just hang out with some friends a grab a good solid drink. \n\nAs a bar, it is a great place to drink. They have a variety of drinks to choose from, and the drinks are strong. The bar tenders really know what they're doing. I'm always looking for a cocktail that Ive never tried before and if they're strong and made right, it will definitely bring me back. \n\nAs a restaurant, the food is pretty damn great! The idea of pork belly being brought out to you in on its own little smoker should be reason enough for you to come in try it! Not to mention the KOBE TRI-TIP they serve you. Truffle ricotta, zabuton steak, lamb shank, and yellowtail ceviche WILL NOT disappoint you! \n\nThen, there's the outside area/patio. I think this is where it separates itself from the pack. During a nice day or even a nice night, you can just hang out back there. There's a pool in the back, some cabanas, chairs, and even a fire pit that makes you feel like you're no where in the tenderloin or even SF for that matter. Sorta like and bar oasis in the middle of a big city.\n\nAnd the reason that it gets the 5 stars ...well the staff has never let me down. Nice, attentive, and overall great. Even the bar tenders try to smile or help you out if when the bar is jam packed.\n\nI don't know what you're doing still reading this, you should go try the food, and grab a drink already.

Came here for dinner and drinks last Saturday night with a group of friends and we all agreed we had a better time here than at any of the other bars we visited afterwards. The decor is warm and sensual, the burgers look delicious (will have to try those next time) and the salad, while small, was tasty as can be. The drinks were also superbly mixed -- I'm pretty picky about my gin martinis and Chambers made each and every one top-notch. A few of the reviews on here raved about the waffle \"fries\" and truffle dip, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it. The fries were essentially oily potato chips, and the dip was a creamy rich mess.\n\nAfter we had finished eating, we headed over to the back bar/dance room.

We were there for a bday party, we were hoping we could share some small plates like the sizzling tri tip or grit fries; there's only 3 grit fries and like 6 THIN slices of tri tip. The flavors were fine but $8 for 3 fries and $16 for 6 thin tri tip slices? Uh.\n2. Getting full on anything less than 100pp. We spend 40$ pp and were still pretty hungry when we left. The french onion soup was kind of like french onion sauce, the burger was somewhere between a slider and a burger, and swordfish could hardly be found on the plate.\n\nEven the drinks, we thought they were yummy, but it was way small for a $11 drink.

And I'm glad we did!\n\nI ordered the eggs royale- sous vide eggs, crispy hash browns, cold smoked salmon, mandarin hollandaise, & caviar. I really enjoyed the way the hash browns were prepared. It tasted more like a block of lightly mashed potatoes with a crisp outside. Delish!\n\nMy companion had the Tamago (Japanese Omelette) w/ house smoked chorizo. He enjoyed the meal, though the portion was a tad on the small side and he said the smoked chorizo was quite dry. I've never had chorizo smoked, so I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way. \n\nWe also ordered drinks, he had the bloody mary and I the cucumber mimosa. I thought the mimosa was quite refreshing and tasty. I'm not a fan of bloody mary drinks but I tasted his and I thought it was quite tasty as well.

This is the kind of place that has lighting that can't possibly make you NOT look good (a double-edged sword...).  Knowing the neighborhood that lies right outside Chambers' doors adds to the kind of \"this could be a nighttime poolside porn set\" feel that I couldn't quite shake. The cabana area also has a bit of a seventies motel feel what with the pool lighting and hotel rooms overlooking the patio.\n\nI hosted a going-away party here last month in June and reserved an outdoor poolside cabana. There are 2 cabanas available for rental. Each one can fit about 8-10 people seated comfortably. If your group is bigger then that, then they'll have to stand. \n\n\n[ [ RESERVATION TERMS ] ]\n*$150 cabana rental fee\n*$300 food/beverage minimum, met on one tab (tab can be split at the end on a maximum of 5 credit cards, or with cash).\nNote: Since drinks are $10/each, it's not too hard to meet the minimum. 30 friends at one drink each, 15 friends at 2 drinks each... fewer friends = they'd better be generously channeling their inner alcoholics.\n\n\n[ [ WHAT I LIKED ] ]\n+ Drinks with tequila & cayenne (e.g. drink #12). I like a little fire in my liquor. \n+ Pisco!\n+ Drink list is manageable and varied enough to suit most palates. I appreciate that the drinks were well-crafted but weren't too fancy pants. Good for pleasing groups.\n+ Cabanas have heat lamps\n+ I worked with Isabel Manchester to book my reservation. She was responsive, accommodating, and easy to work with via email communication\n\n\n[ [ THE MEH ] ]\n- Service was super slow as our cabana was served by one single cocktail waitress who seemed to be running around serving other areas of the lounge. It's hard to meet the $300 F+B minimum if your waitress comes by only once every 15-20 minutes. She was nice enough and got all of our orders correct throughout the night, but the slow service was unacceptable. \n\n- To meet your minimum, you have to order with your specific cocktail waitress so she can put it on your tab. You can't simply order at the bar and tell them to put it on your reservation tab. This was not made clear to my guests at the beginning, and several of them ordered drinks at the bar (since service was so slow) thinking their purchases would be transferred to my tab.\n\n- Chambers is not equipped for cash+carry purchases - meaning your guests must place their orders on the same tab and keep track of how much they personally owe so they can pay up at the end. If you don't have a designated sober-enough person at the end to figure out how to split the tab, well, you're going to end up drunkenly confused and likely overpay/compensate for your equally dazed friends. \n\n- Whoever designed the cabanas must have never thought of the consequences of letting inebriated stiletto-clad girls traipse around ditches with loose rocks. The cabanas are styled with a decorative \"moat\" of small rocks that one must traverse before making your way to a cabana seat. I can't remember how many times I myself or one of my guests tripped on this poorly designed rock moat. \n\n- The cabana area closes at midnight, so if you've got a cabana reservation, your guests will be asked to move inside. God forbid you haven't settled your tab yet at that point. \n\n\n[ [ OVERALL ] ]\nI'd come back for drinks with a small group of friends. I do like their drinks and the ambience. I'd have to think twice about hosting a party here again though, unless they loosened their reservation terms, changed their system to allow for cash+carry purchases, and fixed the sloowww service.", "author": "Megan L."}

When you see the colorful Phoenix hotel, you are in the right place. The door doesn't have a sign.. it's just two black doors. If I had to find this place myself, I would be lost. \n\nI didn't particularly enjoy the decor as much as I thought I would. We sat in a booth in  the hallway leading to the back bar/lounge area. The candles added a nice touch but it was pretty dark in there. Luckily, we went when the sun was still out for an early dinner (well, 7pm). \n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. Towards the middle of our meal, it started to fill up fast. Our server was great. We ordered sizzling kobe tri-tip, sizzling pork belly, tator tots, and butter lettuce salad. \n\nThe sizzling kobe tri-tip was AMAZING. The meat is brought out rare on a sizzling stone and you let it cook to your liking. Kind of like korean bbq but kind of not. It came with pickled veggies in slaw form and mushroom brandy reduction. I took a piece of meat, dabbed some mush-bran reduction on there, topped it off with some pickled veggies... perfection in a bite. \n\nThe sizzling pork belly was just as good but not as sizzling hot as the kobe tri-tip. It came with kimchi-like side that was just super fantastic. It tasted like white kimchi. \n\nThe tator tots are not the traditional tator tots. They kind of look like fat mozzarella sticks but also look like blocks of hash browns. Super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It came with pork remoulade and bacon dust (you have to mix it together yourself)..I didn't know what I was tasting... regular ketchup would have been just fine. \n\nThe butter lettuce salad was just ok. It's just a salad with champagne vinaigrette. The spiced walnuts tasted like candy.. they were made very well. \n\nI also had a sugar cane coke for $6..... seemed a little pricey but it was nice to have bubbles with sizzling meat. \n\nWe were still not totally full after all that. We ordered the Chambers burger. A bit disappointed. It wasn't a burger burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, onion like we expected (we should have read the description before ordering...) . The smoke onion marmalade (looked like bbq sauce with onion chunks) was too much.. it was spilling out of the burger and created a mess. The fries were just ok. I thought the meat was a bit dry. The burger was probably my least favorite part of the meal. \n\nAfter my meal, I walked back to the second bar to take a picture of the \"be amazing\" sign.

Unlike most reviewers the area didn't bother us and we got a great parking spot right outside. We also had no problems finding the restaurant and got sat right away. All which sounds like the start of a great review... \n\nWe both got bloody's, his with vodka mine with gin, both we not spicy enough and for $9 a pop they were a rip off. \n\nMy husband got the burger which was good. Salty, sweet combination due to perfectly caramelized onion marmalade, and   It was perfectly cooked - but $15 for a burger. Not quite worth it.\n\nI got the eggs royale which on the menu sounded delicious: 'two sous vide eggs, crispy hash browns, cold smoked trout, mandarin hollandaise, caviar, chive, dill, creme fraiche'. The hash browns where not crispy at all though the menu clearly said 'crispy hash browns'. It came with smoked salmon not smoked trout like stated on the menu and the dish basically tasted the color it was... Beige. To say the dish needed salt is an understatement. \n\nOverall this place is over priced and super mediocre, we ended up spending $50 on food that wasn't worth the hype.

We did saturday because of the botomless mimosa's. When we arrived there was nobody at the front of the house, she was off serving customers or taking care of something (not 100% sure). When she did arrive she took our reservation and we were seated\n\nRight when we sat down the waitress told us they were already running out of orange juice so if we got mimosa's we would basically just be drinking champagne with a tiny tiny bit of orange juice. So right off the bat we were disappointed, and we were no where near the end of brunch service, its not like we walked in 30 minutes before closing. So we just ordered some other drinks (i got water, everyone else got other mixed drinks), we looked over the menu and as we ordered the waitress then told us that 2 of the 3 items we ordered had been 86'd. At this point I had enough. \n\nThey only do bottomless mimosa's 1 day a week. So the food and beverage manager should be more then prepared for something like that. You know almost everyone is going to order them, so why not just prepare a ton of orange juice. If it was their first few weeks open I would understand, maybe they don't know how many people would actually show up for something like that. But this far into being open you should know to stock up on orange juice. Unless this is a tactic by the owners to draw people in and when they get there just have enough to last you for maybe an hour and then run out.\n\nAlso the Executive Chef is also responsible for ordering food and food prep in the mornings. So if anything does run out its on him/her.\n\nAfter all this I was upset and asked for the check, it took a while. When it finally did come I expected it to only have 3 drinks on it. But of course when I look down, they rang us up for BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA's!!!!! so i totaled up the drinks we had, paid in cash and told the waitress she charged us for mimosa'. She explained it must have been left over from someone elses order and instead of waiting for her to fix the mistake i just put the money on the table and left. \n\nI guess the moral of the story is, if you want bottomless mimosa's or something that is popular on the menu, come right in the morning when they open, an hour and a half after that and its all 50/50 whether you are going to get it or not", "author": "Joseph Y."}

Also, being in the Tenderloin, you will have not just your usual homeless people and beggars, but quite a few very mad and yelling individuals, crackheads when you have to smoke on the sidewalk etc...\n\nAt the end of the day, the Phoenix hotel that is the home for Chambers used to be this huge SF celebrity spot in the 80s, and it's good to relive that a bit :-) We didn't have any food, but the dishes looked great, the crowd was OK, so it's worth checking it out.\n\nHOT OFF THE PRESS: I got a very nice message from Sean M. from Chambers (very nice touch Sean!), explaining that they are just obeying the San Francisco's Department of Health regulations which prevent smoking just about anywhere in San Francisco now. He also mentioned that the celebrities are still there every now and then, so keep your eyes open! With this said, I can be easily influenced by good customer service, and this was part of it for me, so I'm raising my stars to 4.", "author": "Timea B."}

It's an awesome spot - walking up, it looks like an old motel, in fact, that's what it is.  Except that as you enter Chambers, you realize that it oozes ambiance in such a way as to know it's cool, but without being too cool about being cool.  It's a sexy mix of filthy rockstar and high fashion world traveler, with a touch more emphasis on the fashionista perhaps.\n\nThere is a bar right at the entrance, serving up $10 specialty cocktails - we tried the Aviation and Vodka Drink, both of which were awesome.  I also noticed that they were selling the \"Blood and Sand\" like it was going out of style, so it might be a good one to try.\n\nWe wandered off to check out the rest of the bar and found ourselves outside on the patio which melds into the courtyard of the motel, which also has a pool that is lit bright blue and has a few [motel, I think] guests taking a dip.  There's also some table arrangements and an eclectic mix of people hanging out, conversing, drinking, smoking, and what not.  I told it was cool.\n\nWhen we finished our drinks, we headed back inside and to the back bar, where we were reminded to \"BE AMAZING!\"  We ordered a couple drinks and chatted with a few people.  It was funny, because they were shocked that some out of towners knew to find our way to this place.  In any case, when they caught wind of our recent engagement, they bought us a few rounds of beers and shots - so, thanks to those guys and girls!\n\nAfter a bit more fun, we called it a night, and jumped into a cab back to our hotel.

We live nearby and we were really excited when something opened in our neighborhood that we could actually take friends and clients to. \n\nThe staff have always been generally good and some even great over the last few months. \n\nHowever, on our last visit, the cold, unwelcoming service we received really topped it off for us. \n\nI wouldn't consider myself a regular, but I recognize most of the staff so I figure that sometimes they remember me. And some of them do and are very nice. \n\nWe saddled up to the bar and tried to order a couple of cocktails. I said \"hello, how are you?\". The bartender, eastern European woman, I think, looked at us, turned around and helped someone else. No problem, maybe we weren't next, maybe she was in the middle of something. 15 minutes go by, and she's on the other side of the bar, talking to co workers. Finally, she makes it over to us, and said, \"what are you having?\". I'm thinking, ok, everyone has a bad day, it happens. \n\nWe ordered some food, a few staples, and a couple more drinks and wine. I asked her how this one glass of red wine was and to describe it, she said, \"it's good\" and kept staring at me. She made what we both thought was rude comments as if we were inconveniencing her. \n\nIt started to pick up and get busier, and people were ordering around us, and she was getting more and more annoyed with everyone around her, customers and coworkers! She was mumbling things under her breath and giving annoyed looks to people. \n\nI swear I thought we were on an episode of Punk'd. It was like watching a cartoon. \n\nI asked one of the staff that was walking by, a server maybe, about what was wrong with her, is she ok, like maybe her cat died?  \n\nShe said, \"oh she's always like that! We all just ignore her\". \n\nAnyway. We left with a very bad taste in our mouth. Some people just shouldn't be in the SERVICE industry.\n\nI should mention, on the flip side, her co worker seemed very nice and accommodating.

It's in the hood. From the outside, it looks like a shack. As our uber driver parked to drop us off, I thought he had seriously made a wrong turn. But, once you walk inside, you will not be disappointed.\n\nPROS:\n1. Delicious food and cocktails. I had the pre-fix menu, and loved everything. I added the wine pairing but probably would not next time - the wines were all great, but the pours were a bit skimpy. My husband had the hanger steak entree and it was fantastic. The cous cous was a bit too salty for us but everything else was top notch, including the salads and dessert.\n2. Service was fun and professional. We had made a reservation ahead of time and our table was all set for us upon arrival. It was our anniversary and they treated us to two glasses of sparkling rose on the house which was a nice touch.\n3. The ambiance is dark, sexy, intimate and unique. The place is decked out with vinyl records, interesting lighting fixtures, and two beautiful bars. \n4. It is definitely not touristy. After being in the Union Square and Fisherman Wharf areas for 4 days, this was a refreshing, local change of pace.\n5. The attached old school motel is funky - a great place to grab drinks before or after dinner, sit around the pool and people watch.\n\nNote: this place is best for a more liberal crowd. A conservative southern traditionalist probably would not appreciate the quirkiness as much as I do. But I loved it and would definitely go back.", "author": "Nikki V."}

We glanced around looking for clear signage.  We almost walked past it before someone in our group spotted the door.  The reception area is kind of dim, it may take a second to get your bearings if there's even the slightest bit of daylight left outside.\n\nIt was 6 o'clock, there was a decent happy hour crowd hovering around the bar areas. But most of the tables were empty.  We were seated as soon as our group was assembled.\n\nI chose the Chambers Burger with crispy pork belly.  Nothing else really stood out to me.  Two other friends got the burger too.  One of them ordered the burger without the pork belly.  He regretted that later.  My burger was juicy inside with a nice caramelized sear on the outer surface.  The crisp slice of pork belly added a layer of fat and texture that capped this burger off nicely.  The two of us that added the pork belly were very satisfied.  Our friend without was a little disappointed, our \"yums and OMGs\" as we ate probably didn't help.  My friends found the burger patty to be too smokey.  I actually enjoyed the smokey flavor and smell of the meat.  The fries were nothing special.  I dipped a few in the truffle dip another friend ordered.  The dip was ok, it kicked up the fries a bit.  \n\nOverall service was good we never felt ignored.

Hamachi?  Delicious!  Hamachi with a smokey flavor?  Not so much.  Chocolate fudge? Sure. Chocolate fudge with curry ice cream on top?  Why?  Blue Cheese ice cream.... no comment.\n\nThe prices are too much for what you get, as well. Case in point: 16 dollars for the hamachi. It's not that much in the best of sushi places!  I feel like you're paying for presentation that the food just does not need. After $200 for four of us I was still hungry walking out of there.\n\nOtherwise, the venue is beautiful. I love the records, they played my favorite artists all night, and it looks like a great place to go for drinks. Sitting out by the pool on a nice, warm January night with good friends was wonderful. Just don't bother to eat there first. Go somewhere where they don't over salt and deep fry everything. When the crab croquette and deep fried grits taste exactly the same, something's not right. I'm all for experimentation, but not at the expense of flavor. \n\nMaybe with time they'll work out the kinks and return to the basics that have worked for 1000's of years and stop putting a bird on everything.

The charred avocado added a nice creamy, smoky touch to this dish, and while I've always been skeptical of \"cooked\" avocado (grilled, charred, fried, etc.), this was exceptional.  If you like fish and appreciate good food, you should really order this dish!\n\nThe asparagus dish came with a deep fried farm egg, and, wow, this was awesome.

I saw an old record on the wall with a picture on the cover that looked like our friend's cat but then I was sad because my first cocktail tasted like dust. The second cocktail tasted like a sorority ate strawberries then urinated in an empty tequila bottle. We received some appetizers that were (actually) really good. Go to this place to eat appetizers. However, I wasn't aware this was a psych out prix fix French Laundry style menu because when we didn't get our main course within 45 minutes of eating our appetizers, the manager of the restaurant (I know it was her because she used words instead if body odors to communicate) told us that, \"NORMALLY, their patrons like to enjoy a six course meal and like a (I swear to goodness) hot minute between servings.\" Not quite sure where to start with this because I've been lied to before but never have I been attacked in the eardrums with something like the words, \"hot minute,\" in a normal setting where people exist and communicate. First, their menu style can't be described with French words when one section is called \"small bites\" and another one is called \"big bites.\" Secondly, a (cringe and throw up) \"hot minute\" between appetizers and main courses is not equal to 40 regular non-sociopath minutes. We ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time, were served and consumed the appetizers, then waited 40 minutes to not be served our entrees. This can be explained very simply....\n\nI knew a dog that would roll in its own poo when it was scared. This dog found its poo to be a comforting blanket of safety when the world threatened him with confrontation. I'm not suggesting that human cowards do such things but since our waiter looked like he smelled rancid and was so terrified to serve us that whenever he showed his face in the dining area he acted like he got caught shoplifting and if I did suggest that, it would be totally accurate. I'm also not saying that our waiter was a coward who absolutely rolls in his own poo instead of speaking with his customers ESPECIALLY when he crystal clearly forgot to submit their dinner order but if I did that would also be totally accurate. We requested two hamburgers and some vegetables. Because I'm guessing, I know that it takes 10 minutes to make a good hamburger. It's possible yellow-bellied cowards can't do math because our waiter failed to inform us that we couldn't make an 8pm musical (10 minute walk) if we ordered our food at 6:45pm. Important note: I don't know a dog that rolls in its own poo because dogs are angels and our waiter was awkward. Another important note: our waiter is probably a nice guy who just forgot to submit our order to the kitchen or he isn't.\n\nBut, it's close to Thanksgiving so, I'm thankful? We drank alcohol for two hours and ate zero food so by the time we reached the Book of Mormon (you need to see it) we were so drunk that it seemed even funnier than it probably was (extremely funny so probably not). Granted, we were handed our food in a grocery bag as we sprinted out the door to make an even longer sprint to the theater but I didn't taste it because I threw it as hard as I could against a wall. So, thank you Chambers for being incompetent because we laughed harder than we would have had we had consumed solid calories. You are not good at service or food.", "author": "Nick R."}

We tried the cucumber/jalapeno which was my fav of the night, but we also had the vodka/elderflower/basil drink which was good too and the bartender special which was a fancy salty dog basically.  The food was ok.  \n\n-The burger was really good actually but I didn't enjoy the pork belly on top as much as I had anticipated. Pork belly is always, at its worst- the shit! But it didn't add to the burger and it wasn't very crispy so yeah it was a texture issue.  \n\n-salade lyonnaise was my favorite of the night the sweet acid from the grapefruit was delicious with the pork biscotti which was like a giant soft crouton- definitely made that salad. Just wish there had been another poached egg to balance the dish better since there was so much acid/grapefruit and as for the candied pomelo-waste of money/time, totally unnecessary \n\n-Shrimp bisque was very flavorful but kind of atypical, could have used more cream\n\n-the tea smoked tombo tuna simply needed more salt and some acid bad!\n\n-the sizzling tri tip not much to complain about or rave about- it was basically raw good quality meat that we seared ourselves on a hot lava stone-flashy yes. I was craving that mushroom brandy sauce thought but im pretty sure all we had was a side of soy sauce...maybe a change I didn't pay attention to on the menu \n\n-the liver pate was good for liver i suppose-honestly don't have enough experience with it to be comfortable being a bitch about it since the garlic in it was overpowering, but maybe that's how it's supposed to be cuz liver is kinda gross?\n\n-was excited about the pink peppercorn panna cotta but the fruit leather was just a really gross texture and flavor, the whole dish lacked sweetness, inspiring though- will definitely make my own since the idea is redeemable/inspirational.  \n\nWhen it comes down to it stick to the drinks- the presentation makes the food look like it's worth the price tag but it sure as hell doesn't taste like it.  Overall an inspirational menu but everything was either poorly executed and/or unbalanced and left wanting- something that could be easily adjusted to super awesomeness.", "author": "Monica H."}

Outside was a chalkboard sandwich board announcing their brunch special, we stopped, thought about it, but continued on to Brenda's for those irresistible binets and made a note to come back to Chambers to try their brunch. Long story short, Brenda's was overcrowded as per usual, so we skipped back down to Chambers. \n\nThis was my first time here, however my friend always raved about their dinner and bar, so I was eager to finally find out what all the hype was about for a place with such a dark exterior, an ominous big red door and possibly one of the grimiest locations in San Francisco. Upon entry the hip, lilac haired hostess greeted us at the door and immediately lead us to a huge red booth which I made myself quite comfortable in. The atmosphere was dim and artsy, with huge retro screen prints decorating the walls, shelves upon shelves of old records and a lit sign behind the bar that shines the words \"BE AMAZING\", and I instantly thought to myself 'new favorite place.'\n\nSo, the service was slow but that didn't change the fact that the food was to die for. I ordered two side dishes, eggs over-easy which are hard to mess up and a plate of biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were so soft and delicious topped with a gravy like I've never tasted, adorned with tiny flowers and herbs, the presentation made it that much more intriguing. To wash down my food, I also ordered their raspberry mimosa which was blood-red and had real raspberries in it. This place, (aside from their slow service) was perfection.

It was very quite and only two other tables were taken. But what a beautiful place! It combines a modern look of a high end lounge with the coziness of a coffee house that we all like to have in our neighborhood. I like the old school, Le Colonial like chairs, and shelves of vinyl records. As many places there are in SF to go eat, drink and dance, few have the intimate and romantic vibe. This is clearly one of them. \n\nThe menu is surprising too. Lots of dishes are unique and different. I especially liked the blue cheese ice cream and tri tip kobe that comes on a hot stone. The service has been friendly and unpretentious.  \n\nThe place is not cheap but so it shouldn't be, and considering some of the other places in town that are much more expensive and don't have much to back it up with, I am happy to pay the tab at this place.  \n\nI haven't gone to Chambers yet on a weekend night, but I will soon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-16", "description": "The Bambuddha Lounge has reincarnated into Chambers, clearly with a positive karmic balance.  The newly redesigned space is now completely worthy of the Phoenix Hotel's nickname as the Rock and Roll Hotel.  The decor drops a hit of sex on you as you walk in, and the food and drink rock you like a 2 hr set of Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe space is now lined with lush red curtains with prints of attractive people in enticing positions.  The walls are now all shelves of actual vinyl LPs, and even an old movie film projector.  And the vintage couch-like seating gives it all a comfortable living room/ loungy feel to it.  I got the feeling that Jim Morrison would approve of the new decor.\n\nI came here soon after my friend told me that their burger was awesome.  He knows I'm a quest for the ultimate burger, so I had to try it.  Burger topped with PORK BELLY.  The reality lived up to the hype.\n\nThis is one of my top 5 burgers in the city, despite its relatively small size and the bun being slightly cold when I got it.  THAT'S HOW GOOD IT WAS.\nonce I slapped the bun top on, it became an impressive 6 inch tower of burger, but only about 3 inches in diameter.\n\nI picked up the burger, took a breath, found my center, unhinged my jaw, and took a bite.  First thing was the bun--soft, but slightly cold (read:  a little bit stale tasting).  Then the smoked pork belly hit my tongue where the fat melted in a sinful caress with the smoky caramellized meat/fat crunch placating my inner caveman.  And then the burger itself--well seasoned, perfectly prepared medium-rare.  The lettuce and tomato were clean, cold, and crisp.  I was already on cloud nine with my beautiful companion, but this burger sent me straight to the moon.\n\nThe burger came with shoestring fries seasoned with fresh thyme (I love thyme) amongst other things, but thyme being one of my favorite herbs, I thoroughly enjoyed these fries.\n\nWhile Nopa's burger is simple perfection, this burger... god damn, the smoked pork belly rocked my world harder than any piece of fried bacon could. \n\nOK, had to get that out of the way.  The rest of the meal, dish by dish:\n-Red Bell Pepper Soup.  Smoky, creamy, with chicken mousse on the bottom, and a runny poached egg on top, this soup was a perfect start to the meal, and really gets you ready for the burger with the smokiness.  This soup was genius.\n\n-Tomato \"tartare\", burrata, tempura fried shiso and green onions, this was also an inspired dish, although it needed some more toast points to go with it.  I really enjoyed how the cold, juicy tomato chunks  complemented the creamy goopy burrata, and contrasted with the crunchy warm shiso and green onions.  And of course the toast points went well but needed more surface area.\n\n-New York Strip.  There were so many ingredients to this dish there's no way I'll remember them all.  They cut the steak up for you (they ended up undercooking this steak to a full rare), served it on thinly sliced caramellized potatoes, and with this massive mix of vegetables on the side.  Luckily both of us prefer rare to medium, so this was fine.\n\nWe went on a tuesday night, but the place was rather busy, and our entrees didn't come until about an hour after the appetizers.  Between that, the undercooked steak, and the slightly cold bun, I think they're still working the kinks out of the service.  But that still won't stop me from coming back and having that amazing burger.", "author": "Fong L."}

I went to check out their website, and it was at that very moment that I made the decision that this was at the top of my list for \"must try\" places.  I immediately started discussing with a group of friends, and the \"Let's Go To Chambers Eat + Drink 2011 Adventure\" production was underway.  \n\nSo let's recap the day, shall we?\n\n* Woke up, wrestled three alligators, only lost one match\n* Skip to later that evening...\n* Hopped in a cab to head to Chambers. This place is at the Phoenix Hotel in the Tenderloin, which as most people know, this part of town has a friendly and interesting diverse mix of people...so I do recommend cabbing it or walking with a group of people if you love walking. \n* Showed up around 6:00'ish, everything was pretty desolate outside.\n* But what I was told turned out to be true, opened the door and walked into Chambers...a different world completely.\n* This place is insanely unique.  Has a bit of a 50's/60's vibe.  It really took me back.  (I was born in the 80's).\n* It has a really fun vibe, good energy, etc.\n* Had reservations for a smaller group of friends.  We had heard great things about the burger.  So went with the following:\n\nChamber's Burger $13\nprather ranch beef, heirloom tomato, smoked red onion, wagon wheel cheese, whole grain aioli, butter lettuce, challah bun, savory thyme kennebec fries\n\nHad to add the following.  I was going all out:\nCrispy braised pork belly $3\nShaved avocado  $2.5\n\nFor drinks, went for the specialty cocktails, they seemed like they knew what they were doing:\n\nDrink #4:  Tequila Drink\ndon julio reposado, american honey liqueur, yellow chartreuse\n\nDrink #6  Cuba Libra\nflor de cana rum, sugar cane coke\n\nSo the verdict?  They didn't disappoint on anything.  Excellent all around. Oh and I have to mention the atmosphere again.  I just really love it.  They have a huge vinyl record collection that lines many of the walls on bookshelves.  I believe they play music from this collection, have someone DJ etc.  All around solid stuff.  \n\nSo I continued the casual conversation with friends, paid out and then transitioned over to the bar area to meet additional friends in our group that were arriving post dinner.  \n\nSo the bar area...just go check out the pictures on the website.  There is this \"amazing\" sign behind the bar.  Name another bar that has this.  I love it.  Again, a 60's or 70's era feel.  Or maybe 2045 depending if we come full circle, I don't know.  It's a killer bar, kinda loungy at the same time with couches and funky seating, DJ playing, cool staff of servers and bartenders.  Oh and then there is the outside by the pool.  I think I'm rambling now, just thinking about wanting to go back.\n\nI'm jumping to the end of my review now.  Go check it out.  It's highly recommended.  When I went here, it was a bit of a hidden find.  I've taken group of friends back multiple times.  I have noticed it has continually become a bit more crowded.  I hope it keeps that hidden find charm though.  That's what really made me love this place.  \n\nI will say they should remodel some of the outside courtyard area.  It's got a lot of potential, but the layout needs some work.  More fire pits and lions.  When that happens, I'm sure I can up this to five stars.  That's it for my portion of the review where I act like I know how to run the place.\n\nGood times.  Go enjoy.  Love Chambers!", "author": "John R."}

Having an outdoor area is rare in SF and for a warm October night, hanging by the pool was perfect.  The drinks are all very reasonably priced and well made.  They also have a pretty well stocked scotch selection!  The food is tasty - I think I ordered 5 rounds of bar snacks and it came out to be a LOT less than I thought it would be.\n\nI called Chambers the week of my event and told them I anticipated about 15-20 people.  They immediately reserved a large section of the couches at the bar area for our group even though there was a wedding after party showing up the same night with 100 guests.  The management was great and constantly replenished our table with snacks.  A lot more people came than I had anticipated and they were completely accommodating and allowed my guests to skip the line.  The entire night, I rarely had to worry about whether my guests were having a good time because I knew they were well taken care of.\n\nI had such a great birthday.

Chamber's was an opportune comfort.\n\nChambers struck us as tres chic with the walls lined with thousands of vinyl records and a sound track to match. Our starter dish was a truffle dip with wild mushrooms and severed with Ruffles. The truffles dominated the jelly jar it was served in and we wondered again about Millers comfort.  \n\nNext course was chicken liver pate topped with buttered leeks, that where spicy and savory with a raw quail egg. Spread on a crostini this was cherubic. The pancetta roasted figs with a ricotta salata and a balsamic reduction it all floated in as if it was capturing my soul, made me groan with pleasure. These dishes were only $7.00 each and overflowing with smack. The main course of Kobe tri tip steak served on a broiling hot stone that continued to cook the meat if you liked, sizzled our slab.  It came with pickled vegetables and a mushroom brand reduction with a pungent piquancy. I also had the lightly breaded and fried green beans (cause if there are Haricot verts in the house, I order them) adorned with cherry tomatoes, dried olives, gremotlata, and capers. They did the bean justice. \n\nExecutive Chef Trevor Ogden is serving some impressive comfort food that will bring me back every time this hipster in the city. \n\nWe took our wine (a 2007 Foxen Pinot from Julia's Vienyard) and stuck our feet in the pool, amazed and enthralled with the 69's floating below us.", "author": "Teri B."}

What to do and where to go?\n\nAfter hitting this place up on Saturday night, I'm here to report that the answer is Chambers Eat + Drink, located in the Phoenix Hotel on Eddy Street. You'll walk past the hotel parking lot to a couple of nondescript black doors. There's no signage and no doorman. Only a discrete key on the wall will let you know you're in the right place.\n\nBut once through the doors, you're immediately greeted to a treat that's distinct and unlike any other place in San Francisco. A friendly host greets you. No pretentiousness whatsoever. Always a nice treat. A bar waits for you immediately past the entrance. Bookshelves filled with thousands of records line the walls and couches are strategically placed to allow one a view of the place, along with privacy at the same time.\n\nThe stylistic influence of other trendsetting locales like The Standard in LA and especially the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs is immediately apparent by the retro furniture and lighting fixtures. \n\nVeering off to the right past the bar will lead you down a short hallway to a lounge/dance area and another bar. A DJ spins a nice selection of mellow hip hop and R&B classics. The crowd is mid-20's to mid-30's; the guys wear distinctive hipster-casual attire, while the ladies are a bit more mainstream. A Chanel here, a Balenciaga there, if you know what I mean.\n\nDuring warmer evenings, stroll outside to the pool area which has speakers, a separate bar and cabanas set up (although the cabana furniture apparently hasn't arrived yet, since this place is only about two weeks' old). I can imagine that summer daytime pool parties can't be far behind.\n\nFind yourself craving some late night snacks? No problem, the menu features plenty of comfort food, all reasonably priced. \n\nMy brother and I arrived at around 11:15 and easily stayed to shut the place down.

I had some trepedation about meeting  a friend in a lounge with a kid but they were super accommodating. I am glad that we got there early to get a seat. \n\nI think if you are going to eat dinner or meet a group for drinks, reserve your spot. \n\nDrinks were 5 out of 5 - we had a few drinks off the menu. \nService was 5 out of 5 - our waiter really watched the table, knew all of the items on the menu and my water glass was never empty for more than 5 minutes and I drink a ton of water. He also was not intrusive but there when we needed him. \n\nFood - we had an order of the Truffle and chips (i loved the chips but not the dip 3 out of 5), Bar nuts (5 out of 5-unique and amazing), Smoking Hamachi was original in presentation with great flavors (5 out of 5), Salmon with forbidden rice porrige (4 out of 5) and Fish and Chips very good. \n\nThe ambiance is great for a date, a dinner out, a drink with friends, and the record collection, dark wood, fireplace and candles really worked for me. \n\nWe plan to come back before and after we hit a show at The Great American. \n\nThis is a great place, I woulid check it out but make a plan because it's a cool place and like most cool places it is in demand. \n\nGlad we checked it out.", "author": "Amanda J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-24", "description": "Holy crap this is a hidden gem. After seeing more than two dozen couples ahead of us at Brenda's, we decided to branch out and try something else. Chambers came up on Yelp, and we looked at the spot on the map, scratching our heads. What restaurant? There was that odd Phoenix Hotel that seemed like it was loaded on a flatbed truck in 1976 Los Angeles and trucked to San Francisco. Maybe it was in there? Well, it is, in fact, through a pair of nondescript black doors that open directly only the Eddy sidewalk.\n\nInside the 70s motif (intentional? I can't even tell!) continues. There's old LPs on shelves and what looks like old Bond movie artwork. Happily, everything is fresh and clean; this place isn't a downtrodden refugee from the 70s so much as a Doctor Who, just-stepped-out-of-a-portal-from-the-70s place.\n\nAnyway, it was a 30-45 minute wait, but the bar was open and serves the full menu, so we happily sat there. The cocktail menu wasn't super long, but it had some interesting drinks, so my wife went ahead and ordered one, while I got an Arnold Palmer and we put in our order.\n\nI got the soft scrambled eggs and my wife got the eggs royale. The food took a little while to come out, but when it did, it looked good and tasted AMAZING.  The vegetables with mine included sweet snow peas that were lightly cooked and brushed with something so that when combined with the scrambled eggs they achieved a perfect breakfast pairing of sweet and savory. My wife's sous vide eggs sat on a bed of fried potatoes that sort of split the difference between hash and mash, and were crispy without being dried out or at all greasy. The sauce that emerged from the eggs and the sauce could not be wasted, so we also ordered some dry toast with which to sop up the remains, which turned out to be a bit of a revelation on its own. They very obviously make their own bread, and it's fantastic. It absolutely did not need anything to be delicious, though of course it was also good with hollandaise and egg yolk.\n\nAdd to this that Dylan, the bartender who served us, was both really friendly and made drinks that were just as shockingly good as the food. It's not often that my wife will spend a good five minutes trying to figure out all the tastes in a cocktail, becoming somewhat embarrassed at how pretentious she sounded when she tried to explain them to her teetotaling husband. Except that she didn't sound pretentious at all, and anyway it turned out that the very same Dylan had spent a long time adjusting the mixes to achieve those exact tastes. He's a young fellow, but he must be really dedicated to his art. My Arnold Palmer was also good; clearly made of actual lemonade and tea; refreshing and only a little sweet.\n\nExtra points for having a uniformly friendly staff, including the bartender who wore a Star Wars shirt that especially cheered us.\n\nReally, I was completely blown away. It wasn't a cheap meal and if you were looking for Brenda's-level portions you'd be disappointed, but having dined recently at some really ritzy places that were more than twice as expensive, there's really nothing those places have on this one. The location is pretty \"Tenderloin,\" but once past those somewhat forbidding black doors, it's plenty classy, yet it doesn't make you feel out of place if you didn't dress up. This place deserves to be at the top of the short list.", "author": "Nathan P."}

It's actually a nice venue. They aren't located in the nicest area, but once inside the venue it is quite nice. They have a decent outdoor area with a pool and fireplace. There are two bars inside (one near the restaurant area and another further inside). \n\nThere was also a decent crowd.\n\nSo why the 2 stars? A specific bartender, who was shady! Upon arrival my buddy and I decided to get some drinks. On our first round of drinks we ordered from a female bartender. Without thinking twice I paid with a $100 bill, before she actually had a chance to tell me the price. I didn't realize that she'd be shady. When she came back with my change she gave me  $77 back (no receipt, which I saw her throw away). I didn't really think much of it at the time, and I left and extra $4 as tip. However, on our second round we decided to try the guy bartender, because we thought our first drinks were kinda weak. Upon ordering the same drinks he charged us $20. I then realized the first lady short changed me in order to get a better tip. I realize that some people may leave lousy tips, but its totally uncalled for to just short change your customers. I left a very generous tip for two drinks that should have cost $20 (I left $4, and she took another $3).\n\nI really wanted to love this place. The venue is nice and it seems like a chill place to hang out, but it really bothers me that a bartender would try to take advantage of customers.", "author": "Richard P."}

I love the lamb shank - so tender, and with lots of veggies on and near it for a great complement.  I also have tried the burger - it is better every time I order it.  I know they offer shaved avocado and/or crispy pork belly on top, but I am content with that slab of heirloom tomato that comes with.  I am a big tomato fan - that wins for me.  Another meaty bit is the Kobe beef tri-tip that comes out sizzling on a hot stone.  I love tri-tip, and the mix of julienne veggies that comes with it.  The meals are balanced here - well thought over.\n\nAnd - of course - Chambers is a bar, too!  The drinks are high-quality and always fresh - just what you would expect from the Manchesters.  They have always been so stylish, but they really nailed this one.  The furniture and decor are worth the trip by themselves.  The feeling gets better when you are sitting in such splendor, sipping a great drink.  The sign encourages you to be amazing.  An easy task here.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the service.  This is where Chambers is going to excel over its lifetime.  These people make every guest feel like a VIP.

Got my food n finished it fast because I was starving. \n\nWhen I saw my food come out, especially the tri tip, I was very disappointed. The meat amount was literally shaped like the size of an IPod nano with 5-6 small pieces pre cut. And that cost $16 just for that little crap.\n\nThe burger was small too, and I don't know what everyone else had tasted from both the dishes I ordered, but it was both mediocre to me. The burger with pork belly was $17 and I rather spend $5-8 and get a delicious Nations burger instead.\n\nI also had two alcoholic drinks, one old fashioned and one Cuba libre. And each was $11. Tried a few appetizers with my group and overall all the food was really salty. \n\nPrices for what you get are totally not worth it. I rather take my $50 n spend it at House of prime rib or Harris restaurant where I will be full for sure after. \n\nAnd let me add that I came here starving and didnt eat for several hours before and after eating here, my stomach felt bloated n uncomfortable. And a hour later I had diarrhea more than once. It was definitely because of here. Either a dirty unclean fruit from my alcoholic drinks, dirty glass, or something in the food was dirty or maybe either the food prep or bartender didn't wash their hands?\n\nThe only good thing was the service and music from this place.", "author": "Pudgy G."}

Yet somehow, it's also more \"real\" and authentic than a dive bar. 10,000 actual records serve as decorations throughout the joint, making me feel like I'm hanging out in my (future) expensive loft with my (present) music collection. \n\nAnd speaking of music, this place nails it. On the two separate occasions I've been there, the DJ was spinning tunes that were at the very least enjoyably non-intrusive, and at the most, conversational centerpieces among my group. I had to ask the DJ about his collection, and was amazed to hear he was spinning the vinyl right off the walls. Decor you can actually hear. Legit.\n\nThe food is tasty as well, though the drinks are the showstoppers. I'm not usually one to invest in high-end cocktails, though these are well thought out pieces of art. The prices are standard for higher-end fare, and don't expect them to pricematch with their TL neighbors, but everyone left feeling like they got more than their money's worth.

Not sure it's exactly the happy hour joint (was mostly empty but the hostess still watched us select our seat with hawk eyes), but it definitely has potential to be a great late night lounge venue.

Loved all the wood paneling, oversized seating, banquets and mood lighting.  The front is set up for dining and some drinking, whereas the back is all drinking and lounging.  Drinks were delish (names escape me) and strong, though we were upset they didn't have any happy hour specials (perhaps that has changed now).\n\nInteresting outdoor patio that is shared with the hotel...wonder if it will get much use (let's be honest, SF isn't exactly known for our balmy summer nights)...but could be nice for daytime drinking.\n\nWould definitely go back late night to check out the scene.

Very distinctly smokey... I love butter lettuce, single slice of tomato.. I don't remember any pickles, but the smoked red onion? was awesome... but the kicker was the aioli.. it was a whole grain mustard aioli? loved it..... meat was nice and juicy and well seasoned and the whole thing was just the perfect size burger... patty not too fatty.. not too small....  and I like the fact they don't have to put bacon on it to make it tasty.\n\nthis place was pretty pricey in the end.. we didn't get dessert, but it was like $80 a person b/c of all the drinks and appetizers/sides... \n\nbathroom was clean.", "author": "Easter E."}

During our dinner, we decided to see if these LP's were fake covers or actual vinyl, and lo and behold!!! they are real legit vinyl records.. pretty cool in my opinion. The whole place gives of a sorta 60's hipsters den feel... This place looks likes what i would image Frank Sinatra's den would look like..\n\nAnyways, back to the main reason to go here: food and booze!\n\nThe menu selection is extremely limited. 90% of our party ordered the burger with pork belly... They liked it, but were not so hyped that they needed to fight the urge to twitter their encounter with this beef patty incarnation.  I had the chicken roulade and sorta impressed... It was moist and had a decent flavor. I think it was served on top of a bed of what i thought was wheat bulger, but was in fact beluga lentils! they were flavorful enough, which is tough for what it is...  Just wished my food was hotter but that might have been because our group was so big.\n\nMy foodie friend ordered the steak and was unimpressed because of the price.. he expected more or something more magical..\n\nHowever, out dining experience wasn't a total exercise in drab cuisine! Others in my party ordered clam chowder and loved it. I didn't taste but they passed the bowls around and everyone savored it. For me i ordered smoked grits fries.. I was amazed... AMAZED! The \"sticks\" of grits were breaded with some sort of smoky crumbs and fried/baked into perfection. The grits themselves were creamy and hot and the outside was like ... DAMN!!! THATS SMOKY GOODNESS... \n\nWe ordered some mixed drinks and everyone liked their custom concoctions. We were shocked to see that we were charged $1 extra for ordering Jameson on the rocks. We were about to make some snide comments about subtle gouging when our wonderful waitress explained that the charge wasnt for the ice, but for the extra booze in the glass... OOOOhhhhhh\n\nAnyways, lesson of this adventure: Go to Chambers to for drinks and their appetizers, but skipped them if you want to have a full meal.... i would have given this place 3 stars but the cool motif, great waitress, and smokey goodness made me be more generous.\n\nProvecho!", "author": "ariel r."}

The dishes are flavorful, fresh and well put-together.  We ordered a lot of small plates and skipped the big plates altogether.  The pork belly lettuce & tomato roll is a lovely balance, the kobe tri-tip is delicately marinated, and the marble potatoes are surprisingly delightful.  And I do love the desserts--the carrot caraway cake is moist, and the chocolate ganache is sinfully scrumptious. What is missing is a bit more care in the details and execution.  The pork belly would be better if it were weren't tepid, but cooked to that perfect \"melt in your mouth\" temperature, and the carrot cake would taste that much more heavenly if it was a bit warmed up.\n\nFriendly service.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  They don't quite have the thoughtfulness of the real pros, but they're nice and make an effort.\n\nBest part of the experience: perfect balance of everything!

I stumbled to Chambers and it looked like a good place for the celebration. Since they open til 2am. I called around 11 something at night and tried to make a reservation. The guy I spoke to said since this is a large party, I had to talk to someone else who could help me make a dinner reservation and he will have that person call me back the next day. Next day, I received no call so I called back myself. They said they can accommodate us if we arrive at 6 and leave by 8pm, seating us in a private lounge area. I figured that since it is around the holidays, this is the best as it can get so I took the offer. Then later that day, I received another call from them, telling me that the party that was scheduled at 8 is coming in early and they don't want to rush us out early so they wanted to eat us outside to the outside common dining area, but had to break our party of 14 into group tables. I declined the new changes and decided to try the restaurant with just me and my boyfriend instead of the large party.\n\nWe made a reservation for a Saturday night for 7pm. A party of 2 is definitely a lot more easier to make a reservation for. We decided to arrive early to see if we can dine early. The entrance of the place was a little bit hard to find because there's no translucent window where you can look into the restaurant and there were no restaurant name at the door. We had to ask the front desk of their motel neighbor to find out the large wooden doors on Eddy St. leads you into Chambers. Once you get in, you're greeted by the host and the place looked empty with a few guests at the front bar. But the best bar is located at the inner part of the restaurant where a large \"BE AMAZING\" sign on the wall lights up in your face. We got seated next to the windows where you can look out to the courtyard that's shared with the motel next door, which includes their swimming pool (I wonder if Chamber guests can get access if they happen to wear swim suits), a fire pit, and a cabana. Our server was really nice and she constantly checked on us to see if we're having a good time. She also mention that since they have a full bar, they can customize any drink we want, we don't need to follow their drink menu.\n\nI ordered the braised oxtail ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Chamber burger along with the truffle dip chips to share. The truffle dip was good, I liked their chips and the dip was really flavorful. The ravioli was good too, but I'm having mix feelings about it because the ravioli was stuffed with the meat and it just seems like it's missing something. I can't really pin point what is wrong with the dish, but I'm placing my taste buds along the line of texture, it's missing some sort of textural palette to the dish. My boyfriend really enjoyed the fries that came with the burger, it reminded him of McDonald fries. The meat was cooked exactly how he wanted it and it has an intense charbroiled flavor to it.\n\nThe place definitely has more of a lounge vibe than a restaurant. It's dimly lighted and the whole place is filled with shelves of old record covers. Kind of an old hollywood feel with some modern touches around the place. The seats are covered with mismatch textiles with mainly wooden furniture. It's a long narrow space that stretches probably about half a block with compartmentlized spaces so there's a sense of separation between group dining/small party dining/bar. I liked the set up of the restaurant, but I think this place is better for drinks and small eats rather than a full dining experience. My suggestion is to have dinner somewhere else and then come here for a few drinks with some friends.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Dude- talk about a diamond in the rough!\n\nChambers is swanky and cool- without catering to the typical crowd that typically goes with this vibe. (Yes Marina-ites, I do mean you!) I didn't really enjoy waiting at the bar for what seemed like forever...especially in a place that wasn't crowded! Regardless, they make a great vodka soda (how can you screw this up anyway?) at $6 a pop. Not bad Chambers, not bad. \n\nThe atmosphere was neat with all the old records lying about on the shelves. I really wanted to peruse, but felt that wouldn't be appropriate. It was a great place for an after show drink. Definitely felt it was a place where people start their night- not end it. \n\nI liked Chambers. I just may be back!", "author": "Annalise F."}

Like its name Eat + Drink, Chambers is split up into a sit down restaurant area and a lounging bar like area. I absolutely love the ambiance of the \"Eat\" side. Chamber gives a very unique vibe, especially when it's located next to a motel. They have vinyl records lined up on the shelf  and booth chairs mixed with modern chairs and tables. \n\nThe menu is a blend of tastes from Japan, Mediterranean and France. What we ordered:\n\n:::Artichoke Soup:::: - It has PORK BELLY in it! Creamy and warms my tummy.\n:::Truffle dip::::- Absolutely addicting and if you love truffle, it's a must order item on the menu.\n:::Chicken Liver pate:::- Nicely done\n:::Smoking Hamachi::: - I love the idea of pairing it with a fried shiso leave.\n:::Sizzling Kobe Tri Tip::: - On a sizzling rock; soft tri tips however don't over cook it by leaving it on the rock too long. \n:::Oxtail Ravioli:::- Taste good but it reminded  me a little like pot stickers.\n:::Chambers Burger::: - (Med Rare) Had better. It came with thyme fries.\n\nSomeone at the table suggested: \"This would be a great place for New Years Eve!\" I guess I'm not the only one who's thinking about returning to Chambers.", "author": "Christina W."}

We had the champagne service which was nice and then to start shared the challah toast and compote, sooo good. We all ordered our own food with the intention to taste all of the entrees. I had the breakfast sandwich that had mushrooms it was good, but a little on the small side. I also tried the tofu scramble and a smoked trout dish that were equally good. The smoked trout had Delicious creme fraiche and caviar  on top of a thin hash brown. My brother had the hangover hash that looked really good,but it's not really my thing. We decided to really go for it and order dessert which was a souffl\u00e9, it was so worth the 20 min wait. Over all super good. We drove and parked in the hotel parking, which seems like if you're eating at the restaurant you should be able to park there, but we found out you can't, and had to pay 22 dollars, which isn't so bad.", "author": "ashley m."}

Salmon - normally I would go for something more exotic than salmon, but due to Chambers limited entree choices (5 or 6 total) The salmon was small in portion (size of a deck of cards) and garnished with a cauliflower mash that made the plate even more bland..overall this is well below par for SF.\n\nI really want to like this place but the menu/food has a long ways to go - I'll be back, but i think drinks only will be the choice...also have fun parking!", "author": "Ryan P."}

I slowly made my way to the bar being very patient and finally get to rest my hands on the bar after 20 something minutes waiting to get through the crowd. There's a tall guy serving everyone who seems too busy.  The polite bar tender (shorter guy) is taking table orders so he's doing his thing. So I just keep waiting... Eventually there are people asking me if I'm getting something and I just nod \"of course\" and yet he keeps serving people around me. It kept happening until my friends came to find me telling me they were ready to leave. Was it my t-shirt or something??

I laughed as i read several reviews of people saying not to walk here because it's terrifying. Haha. True, the neighborhood is sketchy-  there's homeless people wandering around and trash on the ground and gutters is a normal thing. If you're not used to the city life at night, then yeah I see people being put off by walking around here - it's not like its Beverly Hills or anything... Location aside, Chambers is your typical hipster joint located in a slummy part of town. The interior design is really nice. The whole vibe was music inspired as you see tons of vinyl on the shelving along the walls. You get hipsters mixed in with travelers, as the restaurant is located in the Phoenix hotel. The place wasn't empty when we got there so we expected our food to arrive promptly. We ordered the EGGS ROYALE, which was really good. Poached eggs that sit on top of a really crispy hash topped with dill and smoked salmon. We also ordered the PANCAKE SOUFFLE,which we were told would take 15 minutes because of the preparation for the dish. Which was fine, but it actually took about 30 minutes. The texture and presentation was on point - until we bit into it. The thing was bland. Lastly we got the French Toast, which ended up being soggy. We figured they let the dish sit while waiting for the Pancake souffl\u00e9 to finish. Service was NONEXISTENT. The server visited once during our stay to tell us the souffl\u00e9 would take longer than expected. Trying to flag her down was a mission - I guess we weren't in her peripheral as she was more busy greeting and chumming it up with the regulars / or people she knew as they walked in. The expediter who brought us the food was great though, big ups to him for getting us extra plates and water. To sum it all up - waiting 30 minutes for a breakfast meal was simply off putting. They could've at least served the other dishes before prior to the dish that took the longest to be made. We should've gone and tried DOLCE AMORE instead.", "author": "Fred O."}

Also hearing the Joseph Gorden Levitz had a party there, made it even more appealing in my eyes (considering he's smokin' hot and always has cool roles in good movies). So I decided it was going to happen on my birthday, since my friends automatically have to go to a place of MY choice. We walked in w/ a group of 10 and were seated within 20 min. My first drink was the Vodka Drink. Sooo good. I probably could've enjoyed more, but since it was my special day, I thought Champagne would be a better choice. I tried everyone else's drinks too and they were super tasty, not to mention potent. \nFor food, we started out with the Wild Mushroom Truffle Dip, which was intense but super good. Although I wish it came with more mushrooms and more chips! The chips went in a second, and there was still tons of dip left. We asked if we could have more, and they said we'd have to pay form them, which is odd considering the Truffle Dip probably costed wayyyy more. Anyways, next my friend and I shared the Slow Roasted NY Strip. Wow...I could really eat that dish every day. The veggies underneath the steak were especially good. \nThe food and drinks were delicious, but the atmosphere was the best part for me.", "author": "Sonya D."}

Holy hipster heaven, Batman! \n\nYup, the atmosphere is pretty cool and I dig the style - the pool courtyard, records, music selection, all that.  Cuz I'm such a hipster, yo!  But dammit if the food doesn't miss the mark, and at the prices they're charging, it just left me feeling unsatisfied and cheated.  It started off fine, the cocktails weren't too shabby, and our starter of chicken liver pate hit the spot.  But our other starter, the smoked grit \"fries,\" grits cut into long rectangles and fried, were really overpowered by that liquid smoke flavor. \n\nFor the main course there weren't too many options, we decided to split the tortellini and a salad. Ah, how naive we were to think that would be enough .  Three, yes that's right, three tortellini.  Nothing too amazing taste-wise, served with some half-hearted vegetable matter tossed on top to disguise their paltry numbers and a base of lukewarm orange mystery sauce to add another confusing and unneccessary flavor dimension. Three.  The salad was fine, spinach, orange, nothing too amazing or too weird, except for the bacon.  Now, I was glad to be with my friend that doesn't eat pork, because that means the bacon is ALL MINE (oink, oink!). But I'm pretty sure that this was the pre-cooked bacon because it tasted like thinly shaved cardboard.  Not to be one of those ChowHound, locally-sourced, Alice Waters-lovin \"foodies,\" but pre-cooked bacon is just not tasty.  And there is really no excuse for serving that at a greasy spoon, let alone at a restaurant that is hitting your wallet this hard. \n\nOn a positive note, we did finish with the manchego ice cream with blood orange and that was solid, expecially if you don't like your dessert too sweet.  All in all, I might come back for drinks.  If I was in the area.  And if someone else was paying.", "author": "Ania L."}

However, I do plan on coming here to eat at some point in the near future. This bar/restaurant is located in the Phoenix Hotel-- not in the best of areas. Smack dab in the middle of the sketchy tenderloin to be perfectly honest. However, when you walk inside, you'd have no clue you were in a rather unpleasant area. Everything here is so modern and sleek. There's TONS of seating in the bar area, and there's even a patio outside next to the pool where you can sit by a fireplace and enjoy your glass of vino. I've always had a great time here. I find myself here on \"dead\" nights most of the time, so it's fun to get to know the bartenders and enjoy being silly with your friends without having to make a fool of yourself in front of a bunch of people you don't know.

Approaching the restaurant I was a bit skeptical, as the place doesn't have much curb appeal and it looked like a seedy offshoot of the Phoenix Hotel. Walking in, however, my opinion completely changed. The decor was nothing like I'd ever seen in a restaurant before, in a really good way. It basically felt like someone had transformed their living room into a restaurant. Stacks of records lining the walls, dimmed lighting, and a view of the pool and the fire pit. To start I ordered the Severance Pay to drink, which was awesome. I'm not a bourbon drinker, but the sweetness of the fruit made it easy to gulp down. My boyfriend and I then shared the tater tots, the rib eye steak, and the quinoa salad. All were good, although I wasn't crazy about the pancetta in the quinoa salad. The service was a little bit slow, but that might have been because we were sitting on the patio. Overall I enjoyed my dining experience here and I will definitely return.", "author": "Victoria G."}

Well Chambers is a fresh change to this formula. Located in the Phoenix Hotel (former Bambuddha), the owners have remodeled the entire place. Walking in you get this warm and welcoming feeling, it's almost like rocker 70's vibe meets DJ. The interesting light fixtures, thousands of records lining the walls, beautiful bars and wooden floors really set the place off. If Lenny Kravitz were to build a Lounge/Restaurant, Chambers would be it, but maybe with shag carpeting over the hardwood floors. There is nothing in San Francisco I have found in my 6 years of going out in the city that has this combination of hip and cool, yet warm and welcoming. The warmth just begs for you to stay to last call. \n\nThe Food: \n\nMy friend and I shared a few things which included their burger, that had these amazing smoke onions (think almost bacon flavored sweet onions) and crispy skinny fries, we also shared the Pork Belly App, which is a must have, this dish carries a similar theme to many of the dishes we ate, which could be best described as hearty, yet fresh. We also had the artichoke hearts which had a great combination of flavors and textures and the last entree we shared was the pork tenderloin. The pork itself was cooked to perfection, but we felt the beans and bread that accompanied the dish made it feel a bit dry, I think some type of sauce would make this dish perfect. We finished off our meal with the Creme Brulee, which was actually disappointing, but the attentive staff knew right away that we were not happy and replaced it with the goat cheese cheese cake, which was both beautiful and tasty, but be sure to share this dish, as you could easily split this with 3 people due to its richness.Overall considering this was a soft opening for Chambers we were both very impressed with the food offerings, ambiance and service.\n\nI am excited to have a new hang out that is truly unique in San Francisco, that is casual yet sexy and not pretentious, a rare combination.", "author": "Joseph C."}

That can be frustrating and I am sure I was right in the middle of a learning curve. The extra effort to communicate post-experience is pretty special.  \n\n****\nI wouldn't classify this place A-OK as Yelp's 3 Stars implies.  I'd say, inconsistent. This place deserves 2 stars based on the customer service.\n\nMy gf and I sit down to have a drink and surfer boy bartender is nice and prompt enough.  That's great.  No problem.  Not ten minutes afterwards, the check is dropped at our table.  Odd but no big deal.  The server/bartender with the tattoos (or piercings, extremely low cut top and caked on makeup) comes by ages after that (after we had finished our first round and had been waiting) and picks up the check asking if we wanted to close out (the only other time she came to the table was to ask if she could close out the check). We decline and say, \"actually we want another round.\"  She is cool and says sure (but in a weird insecure way) and gets us one.  She comes back with our drinks and places the check on our table again.  The gothy/Brittany/hipster looking bartender mentions to us, again, that we can close out whenever we want.  We thank her.  \n\nNow, two more times after that she comes back, picks up the check holder and asks if she can close out the tab.  My friend and I are no longer puzzled at the fact that she has come back numerous times to \"close out the check\" and each time interrupting us, we are annoyed. We note that it feels like she is afraid we're going walk out on the bill.  We laugh at the incompetence of her behavior and find it strange.  Especially since we both look like we came from the office.  We continue to drink our drinks and finally, when she comes AGAIN to ask to close the check, I say, \"look, you're obviously nervous about someting, here, why don't you take my credit card and hopefully that will make you feel better.\"  She sighs a big sigh of relief as if that's what she had been wanting all along (I'm not kidding guys) and says \"That'd be great! That's really just all that I need, we just need a card to keep the tab open.\" \n\nShe leaves and my friend and I start laughing at her because if she was so incredibly nervous that we were going to \"walk out\" or that she \"just needed a card to hold the tab open\" Why did she not just Say so? Instead, she decided to continually aggravate us by consistently asking us to pay.  This is not normal.  We chuckled at the lack of communication, causing an awkward situation, about how it is really the bartender's responsibility to ask for a tab, not ours as customers but more importantly, no matter what, a bartender shouldn't be nagging customers to \"pay the check\" like the way she did.  It's unprofessional, unwelcoming and just plain poor judgement.  \n\nWe were just busy catching up.  We had no idea why sufferin' sally was wringing her hands about such a silly issue. All she had to do was Ask for a credit card :T   Weird.\n\nDrinks were decent (not like kool aid but not stiff either) and the ambience is why this review is not a 1 or 2 stars.  Great seating areas.\n\nLike I pretty much say, and know from experience, a place is not going to last if you do not have your customer service DOWN. Period. \nAll of those customers who think your staff is incompetent or pushy or unfriendly or whatever!, will not return, recommend or even worese, spread negative reviews to others which is like a reverse cascading effect of bad \"press.\" \n\nI am not even going to into the closing of the tab screw up.\nMeh~", "author": "Katherine P."}

The walk was long and the Tenderloin was...well, the Tenderloin, but in a good way. How, do you ask?  Well, let's just say that my cousin and I felt fantastic by the time we got to the restaurant because it seemed that every man on the street had a flattering comment to contribute about how pretty our maxi dresses were or how lovely we looked.  Of course, the relative sobriety of the men in question was, well, questionable, and many of them seemed to have slept even less than we had the night before but who were we to judge? We were still perhaps a bit tipsy from the night before and heading to Chambers for bottomless mimosas - the hair of the dog, so to speak. \n\nWhen we got there, it seemed that the doors of heaven had parted to receive us.  It was like a swanky Las Vegas restaurant oasis in the middle of the Tenderloin desert.  The mimosas were pretty good and the waiter (who was loving our crazy hungover/drunken conversations) kept 'em coming.  WE LOVED OUR WAITER!!! So much! He had a very unusual name that I can't quite remember right now, but he was awesome. We shared the biscuits and gravy to start...can I just say AMAZEBALLS?!!!! Hands down the best biscuits and gravy ever...crisp and flaky and golden brown on the the outside, soft and tender and flaky on the inside, and the gravy smelled and tasted like sausage heaven.  That's all I can possibly say, you just have to try them for yourself. We also had the pastrami eggs benedict-type thing (I'm not looking at the menu right now so you'll have to compare the review to the menu), the pork belly with soft boiled eggs and spicy potatoes, and the chambers burger with pork belly.  Holy crap! Everything was the best thing I'd ever had. I'm picky with poached eggs because I don't like runny raw eggs...they made them perfectly over-medium-hard for me. I can't even explain the level of perfection. The pastrami was far from deli-sliced, it was fresh and marbled and delicious, my cousin's pork belly plate was awesome, and my husband's burger was jealousy-inspiring.  I'm not a huge burger person; I mean, I get junk food cravings like everyone else, but burgers are not usually my go-to at a restaurant.  But I DREAM ABOUT THIS BURGER and I only had one tiny bite. I can't wait to go back and get this burger, and, of course, those bisuits and gravy...and anything else I can fit in my belly.  YUM YUM, you must come! Eat here at least once, it's divine!

I ordered a drink called cusco.  It was very crisp and refreshing.  One of the ingredients was ginger beer/soda.  I loved the drink and stuck with it the rest of the night.  The staff was very friendly but still had somewhat of a sophistication to them.  We didn't eat there but a couple plates that came out to others smelled delicious!!!  The decor is classy and fun at the same time.  I kind of felt like I was in the regal beagle from threes company.  There are old records all over the walls.  The music varied a lot but over all was entertaining.  The only thing that needs immediate improvement is the bathroom.  There are two co-ed bathrooms that are horribly lit and needed to be cleaned.  They reeked of potent urine.  I would hate to see how bad  the bathrooms get on a busy Saturday night.", "author": "Marlene G."}

The top dish was the chicken sausage which was called:\npancetta wrapped chicken roulade.\nCooked in a broth, best chicken I have ever had, served on a bed of peas and some rice like grain. Our female server Anda did a fantastic job explaining the menue to us leaving us wanting to order EVERYTHING, she was that good.\nBecause we were too full ordering dessert we literly forbid her explaining any of them to us, as we could have not resisted and probably would have suffered food koma as a result.

Situated in Tenderloin, this place offers a nice mix of trendy/hip with good food and drinks.  The modern look and feel of the bar along with the retro decor of it's lounge chairs and sleek decor makes this place the ultra lounge to beat in SF.  It also has a huge indoor patio with pool that is shared with the Phoenix hotel.  The patio comes  complete with outdoor seating, tables, heat lamps, additional bar and stone fire place. The design is amazing and incredibly uber cool.      \n\nThe mixed drink cocktails menu was really good, too.  The cuba libra cocktail was delicious. In addition, the food is amazing.  We ordered the truffle dip which was savory and a must have bar bite.  In addition, I had the sizzling kobe tri-tip that is another must have.  Tender and perfectly seasoned kobe beef served on a hot stone, which allows you to cook it to your liking.  This is done intentionally if you are sharing with someone, you can cook it well done, rare or anything in between.\n\nThe only draw back to this experience was the staff.  The female bartender was pretty rude and insulting when providing drinks.  I don't know if it was an off night for her, but snide remarks was given when handing off our drinks.  I still tipped and thought it was just random.  Until, I stepped outside and experienced the security guard who also was pretty rude.  He stated that he was closing down the area and asked us to finish up our cigarette.  No big deal.  Except, he came back two minutes later saying, 'I thought I told you to leave for smoking.'  We merely responded, 'You stated you were closing down and for us to FINISH up smoking'.  I've been around enough places to know where you can't smoke.  However, if I'm outside where there are a couple of people smoking, one of which was a bartender, I figured it would be acceptable.  This totally brought down the vibe and should be fixed.", "author": "James M."}

The new restaurant and lounge used to be the old Bambuddha, for those of you who recall the pool parties...I do!!!  Chambers did a COMPLETE overhaul.  The restaurant decor transports you back to the rockin' 70's with the walls lined with classic records, a cozy fireplace, and a killer bar.  The restaurant space is not large so I would definitely recommend a reservation.  As for the edibles, we tried the kobe beef appetizer served rare as it sizzles on a Japanese hot stone and the warm farro salad.  We loved the food so much we went back again last night and this time tried the white bean salad, potatoes with bitty carrots, both were excellent, and then sunk our teeth into the steak loin...cooked to perfection and served with a delicious horseradish sauce and squash...can I say yum!!\n\nIf you are looking for a little action after satisfying your palette, head to the LOUNGE.  The old Bambuddha had a circular bar that took up most of the area.  Chambers tore that out and created an \"amazing\" spacious lounge area with it's own bar.  The bartenders served delectable drinks...I suggest Drink #11, vodka, elderflower, and basil (I may be lacking an ingredient)l, but be careful...they go down fast.

However, if you tell them that you will be taking them on a hip and tasty explosion of the senses (and if they trust you) then you should have many takers. Simply put it is hip, fun and tasty. From the bar atmosphere to the wide cocktail menu to the simply well played menu you will not be dissappointed. Obviously, heads up in the neighboorhood but this is a hidden gem.

No one had any idea what this place was like, so we took a chance on an unknown destination and struck pure gold. Service was extremely polite, drinks were amazing (nothing like we have on the east coast) - especially the 'spicy cucumber', decor was super hip, and the atmosphere itself was perfect to catch up over some food + drinks!", "author": "Johnny C."}

Saw the Yelp reviews and figured why not try it out?  I ordered the burger and my sister ordered the coffee cake, eggs, turkey sausage, and biscuits and gravy; instead she got potatoes instead of the sausage. So they got the order wrong, strike 1.  My burger came and it was disappointing... The buns were toasted but cold, the grilled onions had a super smoked flavor that did not compliment the other ingredients on the burger, the fries were cold too! Strike 2 on a cold burger and fries. As far as service goes... There weren't very many people at all in the resturant so why did it take us forever to get our food and then our check? Strike 3 on the slow ass service.  I wouldn't reccommend this place to anyone for brunch... Maybe that's why it wasn't so busy because brunch may not be their thing but regardless, it doesn't matter what a dining establishment serves and when it should always be good and on point!  I feel like I wasted my money :(", "author": "Tinder B."}

I am a San Francisco native born and raised so I am familiar with the area. I passed up the venue twice because I couldnt see the sign. I finally saw the little Phoenix motel and parked in that lot. I went in to have the receptionist tell me I couldnt park in the lot but to go up the street to another motel and park then walk back to their hotel. I was already exhausted by her instructions but got in my car and found the other parking lot she mentioned. I walked back in my 4 inch heels to the Phoenix hotel for the receptionist to instruct me to go back out and walk to the restaurant entrance next door. Sigh she was killing me at this point. I went in and stood at the front desk awhile before I was greeted and seated. The ambiance was quite cute. I really liked the records and old motown playing as I sat and waited for my friend to arrive. I ordered what I thought was a peach mimosa which I tasted absolutely no juice. I then ordered french toast which was extremely dry so I had to ask the server for some regular maple syrup which I think she was offended that I'd dare even ask as she hestiated and asked me if the maple already on the plate was not enough. My friend ordered the grit balls and said it was quite bland as well however he enjoyed his bloody mary. The server came back again and was almost grilling me as to why I didnt like the french toast. Total turn off. Will not be going back ever based off her service alone. I did like the \"Be Amazing\" decor in the bar area and I think it wise if the server who helped us would look at that sign every hour she's on the clock to be reminded of how to give amazing customer service.", "author": "Jenn S."}

Bored of the same consistently-good restaurants--Bar Jules, Mission Beach Caf\u00e9, and La Mar--I can finally ecstatically recommend a newcomer to the Tenderloin scene. In the aptly-named Phoenix Hotel, the adjacent lounge has re-incarnated itself from Backflip to Bambuddha and now to Chambers. It is sick, or slick, or whatever the lingo is today. It's like entering Bourbon and Branch's library, but better. Like the Ace Hotel, but better. You can actually see your date as the lighting, a refreshing golden hue, has been strategically placed. Even the food is worth the guarded walk from your locked car to the entrance. As for the impeccable food, the PBLT, pork belly lettuce and tomatoes, is stand-out. A big coup for the neighborhood, this new hot spot won't be reinventing itself for quite a while.", "author": "catherine g."}

It was definitely the highlight of our evening (the musical was absolutely horrible)!!!  Chambers is about a 10 minute walk from the theater, and through not such a great part of town, but I cannot say that we felt unsafe walking there.  The restaurant definitely has to get a sign to indicate where exactly it is, because the first thing you come to is the parking lot for the Phoenix Hotel and there is no indication whatsoever as to where the restaurant is located (it's the first wooden door around the corner from the hotel lobby).  However, once you enter the restaurant it is just lovely.  We were warmly welcomed and brought to our table by Sheila, who was just great.  She explained how the food was prepared and anything else we had questions about.  We ordered the sizzling kobe tri-tip and the smoking hamachi, and both were so delicious we went for another round!  Overall, this dining experience completely made our night, and I would highly recommend this restaurant as a perfect place to start off a night at the theater!", "author": "JB A."}

We had dinner there and the food was nothing to write home about...okay maybe a postcard with bold letters: OVERPRICED and OVERRATED.  Since I told all my friends to meet me at chambers, I expected all of them to come inside with no problem.  Nope, I got calls from friends waiting in line telling that the bouncers told them the lounge was overcapacity.  I know that they do that to make it seem like its popping but it wasn't at all.  I thought since we had bottle service, I could ask the manager to let a couple of my friends who had been waiting in line for half an hour to come in but I was greeted with a frown and a no. =(  A bunch of a my friends end up leaving because the line was ridiculous.

From the gracious service (non-pretentious, welcoming staff) to the great food and drinks, we certainly recommend it and will be back again.  It's worth the drive from the Peninsula up to Chambers and we look forward to some warmer nights on the patio around the pool once/if the management decides to highlight this attribute (great fire/water feature, by the way).  Prices are reasonable and the detail of the food presentation is outstanding.  The kobe beef and beet/artichoke appetizers were exceptional and the the beef shortribs and the burger entrees stood out.  Beyond the restaurant, it's just a great place to hang out for comfortable lounging as the vibe is inviting with great furniture, music and patrons.", "author": "Eric M."}

Outdoor patio with pool and firepit with bar was my first eyeopener (no smoking though - take it to the front area) The back bar with plenty of sofa space was accomodating for my large group and noise level was low so you can actually hear each other. Happy Hour prices were fair and strength of drinks matched. Very roomy and Highly recommend for an after work or weekend drink amongst friends or dinner with the significant other!

But I am tempted to say, perhaps controversially, that it might be worth getting mugged just to experience its unique setting... and try their hamburger with the awesomely-skinny thyme fries and a side -- or two, or three -- of Matilda Belgian (of course) ale. But seriously. It's also uber hip, or at least was when I visited, what with its David Lynch mise-en-scene 70s retro decor. You know there's something special about a place that transports you elsewhere the minute you step inside (and perhaps even on the walk over!), and keeps you there for the entire duration of the meal. The only reasons why it's short of a star might be the price-quantity ratio, the awkward location and the fairly nonchalant service, although none of those deterred my enjoyment and ultimate satisfaction. Chambers is definitely one of my top eateries to revisit if I return to slash ever move back to San Francisco.", "author": "G. J."}
