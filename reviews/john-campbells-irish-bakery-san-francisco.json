This has been a favorite for many years and I think so many of the goods are just absolutely delicious. I used to regularly come here for their curry chicken pastry and fly it down to Irvine. The pastry could be frozen and then defrosted and baked later for a great meal. I absolutely LOVE the brown bread here as well. \n\nRecently I got the chocolate and blueberry scones. Both were tasty but I personally liked the blueberry one more. I also got the pork sausage rolls for breakfast which my bf and I loved. In addition, this time around I got the beef pastry and Shepard's pie to stick in the freezer. I am excited to try those on a lazy weeknight!", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

It's where Irish legends are made and heck yea they have delicious morning pastries too! Ok, I honestly had no clue who John Campbell was, but I figured if he's Irish, he has to be pretty cool & kinda lucky... sure look it! \n\nSo a few days ago I decide to grab a few Irish bites from John... it's still a chilly morning in early June here, so I stumble up Geary Blvd. until I reach his Irish Bakery - next door to the Blarney Stone Bar! A charming set-up, sans the cobblestones! A little piece of Ireland here in the outer O'Richmond!\n\nAs I walk-in I am warmly greeted by a \"maybe\" Irish young lady with a thick American accent! Ahh well! So I order a Beef Pastie, a Blueberry Scone & a Chocolate Scone. While the polite young lady heats up my Pastie, I notice all the souvenir t-shirts and little trinkets. Framed photos of dogs & people adorn the walls and just a feel for Enya! Since no tables are found I decide to get my hot tea next door at the other Irish coffee shop... O'starbucks! \n\nYup, so I looked John Campbell up and came up with this... *John Campbell, Journeyman Baker from Belfast with more than thirty years of experience, has come to the Richmond District. \n\nJohn holds the Order of The Master Baker from Belfast, Belfast City, and holds a Guilds Bakery Certificate making him the repository of many decades of baking tradition in the authentic old style. With this wealth of experience, John Campbell's Irish Bakery opened on Geary on May 21st, 2007. The Irish Bakery offers traditional Potato Bread, Irish Crusty Bread, Brown Bread, Sultan Scones, and of course Soda Bread, all made in the very same fashion with the very same ingredients that your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents might have enjoyed.*\n\nAfter a few bites I can clearly see why John Campbell's has been around for over a decade while retaining such high ratings. It's the quality & love put into what they have to offer. Everything is good & quite filling, but if I must choose I'd say the chocolate scones wins my award. Not overly sweet, just done right... with a cup o' tea or coffee. Oh my! \n\nAll in all, I recommend John Campbell's Irish Bakery! You can expect quality bites at affordable prices to boot! Yup, you still got those darn English taxes, but heck it's still worth all your sixpence! And \n\nMay you always have walls for the winds,\n\na roof for the rain, tea beside the fire,\n\nlaughter to cheer you, those you love near you,\n\nand all your heart might desire.

They can heat it up for you in the bakery, otherwise you can pop it in the microwave for 4 minutes at home. The filling is hearty and the mashed potatoes plentiful and buttery.

(esp the cream filled ones + other pastries) \n\nSunday morning, 10am: \nI had high hopes for trying their infamous Cream filled scones, but they were already out!!! Different questions and thoughts loomed in my head: \"How little did they make that it would run out so fast? Did they not make enough? Or did someone just buy a whole bunch? Or is this place that popular?\" \n\nI read other reviews before coming here, but none of the reviews mentioned that I had to be here early before they run out of their creme filled scones?!?! Yelpers, c'mon!  So, my tip for you guys is that if you want to try their scones, get there early! They open at 7am. Don't risk it and wait till 10am. \n\nI also noticed that other yelpers had pictures where the bakery case was filled with other pasties, like meat pies and such. When we arrived, the bakery case was EMPTY! I mean there was only a tray for the sausage filled pastry and this thick roll pastry topped with Bacon, Cheddar, and lots of onions. Warning! This pastry was loaded with onions! Left me with onion breath even though I only had a few bites. \n\nSo, anyways, after being disappointed about the cream filled scones selling out, which the girl working there was NOT AT ALL sympathetic of my situation, I still had to buy something since I made the trek over here. \n\nI gave in to buying their \"overpriced\" Irish Soda Bread, which was HUGE, but also I don't think needs to cost $7.75!!! I bought it anyways. It was good and very bready. It's not dry like most soda breads I've eaten before. \n\nAlso, I bought some scones for the road. Raisin and Blueberry scones for $1.75 each. These scones are a lot more buttery and doughy then most scones. They are soft, not dry. The texture is more like a biscuit than a scone.", "author": "Mel H."}

The service (nice woman behind the counter) was very pleasant and I am definitely coming back to sample more.", "author": "Glenn H."}

While some of the other offerings there seemed promising (like the shepherd's pie and the pasties), I opted to just get myself a blueberry and a chocolate chip scone this time around.\n\nHeating them up the next two days, one in the microwave (which was a mistake), and one in the toaster oven, I'd say that, simply, they were okay. Neither the worst nor the best I've had, with an alright texture once toasted and buttered, but a bit too bland and crumbly when dry. I definitely much prefer the scones I've had at some coffee shops in Taiwan, as well as the ones at Arizmendi, though they make a different variety than John Campbell's does (which I'd say is the more traditional version).\n\nThat said, not too bad, and I can see myself dropping by if I were in the area again, if not just to try some of the other offerings on hand.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A small little shop with DIY bread pickup, and display cases for the other pastries.

John Campbell's forgoes the all-too-common Irish kitschy bric a brac, focusing instead on what you came for: the scones, pasties, sausage rolls, shepherd's pies, and other baked goods. The decorations are pictures/drawings of a couple dogs, which I assume are the owner's. You have an Irish blessing and a letter to the Republic signed by James Connolly (maybe the Easter Proclamation? the text was small). Rather more authentic than throwing Joyce/Wilde etc. everywhere. \n\nMoving on to the food: there's no seating here, so you'll be getting everything to eat to go. I've had the plain scone, blueberry scone, plain scone with cream and jam, meat pasty (very much like a Cornish pasty), and chicken curry pasty. The scones are great, denser and a bit drier than my mother's, but good nonetheless. At home we'd do scones with jam, but with cream and powdered sugar works very well with these because they're denser. The meat pasty is fantastic, very filling giving the price. I wasn't actually a fan of the chicken curry pasty, the curry was very dry and the consistency was weird. The one thing here I haven't liked!\n\nWhile here, grab some Barry's, the finest tea.

There was a gamut of scones, open face sandwiches, tarts, and other delicious looking breads but I was already wedded to the fruity and chocolaty options that were sitting pretty by the window. \n\nI thought my apple puff had a nice smooth flaky texture on the outer-layer, but the powdery sugar was not enough to inspire a lackluster taste in the chopped apple spread. My fruit bun was much more dense and hearty than expected with a nice sprinkles of cherries, walnuts and raisins, and the texture resembles much more like a scone than a sweet bread. \n\nMy chocolate snowball was sinfully coated with a layer of coconut on top of thick dark chocolate with cake-like filling embedded with raspberry jam. It was one of the items where the taste was robust and distinguishable. My huge foccacia bread tasted similar to the ones at Giovanni's Cafe, and the thick doughy texture was pretty good to go with a thin spread of olive oil and chopped herbs and spices. \n\nOverall I thought the food was decent with a few uninspiring spots.

It just happened.  \n\n2009 has been odd from the start.  Dating?  Men from Dublin, men from Waterford, Limerick.  The lovely Irish accents (Gaelic from one made me swoon).  Hung out with the Irish in Boston and then vice versa here in SF.  I'm loving this experience, made even better with the damn soda bread served at Foley's.  I was munching on that even though I ordered my usual hamburger.  \n\nI've passed by this bakery many a time but just never went in.  Granted the lovely baked scones and breads have always been puffing themselves up at me but I've never paid any attention.  Fast forward to recently and I did go in after perusing the counters at the Kosher deli next door.  Large fresh scones with chocolate, blueberry, and raisins topping the wicker baskets in the display window.  Shortbread cookies with heavy glazing.  Breads.  Soda bread.\n\nThis is help yourself service, so grab one of the little white baggies and proceed ahead with picking what best entices you.  In my case, I selected three of the almond shortbread cookies with the white sugar glaze, one blueberry scone and one Irish Liquer Almond Scone.  \n\nOne of the things that seem to deter me from purchasing some scones is that there is a slight bitter aftertaste down my throat.  Why?  Too much baking powder can shift that subtle balance in the batter and unfortunately, such was my experience with the Irish Liquer Almond Scone.  A slight disappointment.  However, I did nibble away at the blueberry scone, delightful, crumbly and chock full with berries.  The cookies were somewhat disappointing because the lovely buttery shortbread was hidden beneath the thick glaze of sugar icing.  I did not even have the heart to offer any to the fellow, since it was basically munching on a sugar glaze wafer.

I pointed it out to hubby and on our way back we stopped by to take a look. Naturally as we entered I noticed several items I wanted to buy, although, I wasn't sure when I'd be able to eat them all. I picked up some raisin scones, the Guinness bread, mince tarts, chicken curry pastie. As I went to pay, the nice guy behind the counter asked me if I'd ever tried their blueberry scone. I said no I had not. I said they didn't have any out there. He said well that's true, but there is one left -- one which he was planning to take home with him, but I could have that one. WOW.... now that's what I call customer service.\n\nWe chatted a bit and when he found out that was our first trip there he said he would throw in some brown bread for us to try as well. He cut half of a loaf and gave that to us. I was even more surprised to find that he wasn't the owner, nor was he even part of the family. This guy just works for them and you know what? Mr John Campbell, or whoever the owner is should be so lucky to find an employee like this, who is so passionate about the wares he sells and has such a personality to deliver this love to the customers.\n\nAs we were leaving, the young man got a hold of some garlic bread sample and ya guessed it..... we had to buy the loaf of garlic bread as well.\n\nOnce again I am saddened by the fact that I no longer live in the Bay Area and I am no longer surrounded by anything that vaguely resembles what can be called culinary diversity.\n\nBy the way -- that blueberry scone was to die for. The curry pastie was so delicious even the next day although the pastry portion wasn't flaky anymore, but the filling was just awesome. And the Guinness bread? He said that it would be good for a week and he was right. After 5 days it's still tasty as ever although I doubt it'll last past tonight once hubby gets his hands on it. The brown bread -- slightly salty taste which, with a dollop of your favorite preserves makes it just outta this world!!", "author": "Anita L."}

I've been in the neighborhood about a year a half and have had the pleasure of tasting many of John's goods.

Counter display items are more meal like and are 4 to 8 bucks, or so. And they have samples all the time!\n\nAmong my favorite savories: Chicken Curry Shepherd's Pie, Chicken (or Vegetable) Curry Pasty, Garlic Pecorino bread (YUM), Potato bread and most recently, the Roast Beef Fococcia sandwich. (Oh.Em.Gee. Sliced just thick enough, cheesy, and flavorful with a little kick.

Thankfully, the staffers were patient and entertained a friend who popped in with a sombrero (obviously celebrating Cinco de Mayo the proper way).

I loved the flakiness of the pastie and wasn't soggy at all. The filling consisted of hearty pieces of chicken with peas, potatoes, carrots. It wasn't dry and incredibly savory! \n\n- Apple Tart: I love that their tarts are mini, so saves on the caloric intake. Anywho, I had to get something sweet to go along with my savory pastie. This was amazing, and you have a choice between a regular or crumb apple tart. The crumb one is sweeter, and loved how rich and appley the filling was. A lovely sweet treat! \n\n- Chicken Curry Pastie: Dalane ordered this and loved it, and concluded that it was like my pastie but with a curry sauce, which had a nice kick! \n\n- Fruit Scone: Dalane and I shared this, as she isn't much of a sweet tooth (or so she says)! This had a wonderful glazed layer on top of the scone, which was not dry and had ample amounts of fruit and nuts! Yum! \n\n- Turkey Sandwich: Amy ordered this, and was so huge that she only ate half and saved the other for lunch.

Ok, so maybe boiled beef brisket and cabbage isn't very commercial (though don't knock it till you've tried it).

Thankfully, Campbell's Irish Bakery (a spin-off of the Blarney Stone?) has come along to fill the void.\n\nThe selection here is small but perfect: naturally you'll want to get 5 of the best scones in the city for $5, and a belfast bap breakfast sandwich (with eggs, irish bacon and sausage--like a McMuffin, only made of real food).  There's also plenty of breads you can take home and turn into sandwiches or desserts, like Bara Brith.  Only downside is there's nowhere to sit, so if you're too hungry to wait till you get home, well, you can always try to nab one of those outdoor tables at Peet's (or maybe they'll let you eat at the pub if it's open?).", "author": "Wes M."}

Their scones are different from other scones I've tried: they are more bready, they don't have a crunchy, sugary top, and they are not as dry.

I went inside and saw that there was nobody there, and was reminded by a sign that they were a CASH ONLY place.All good, so I go to Chase next door to get some cash, and came back. Good there was people in there when I got back. It turns out that the lady earlier was just kind of hiding behind the counter, probably snobbing herself out or something. Regardless, I went ahead and got a bag and a pair of tongs (since it is help yourself) then started to look for those cookies. She was finally not busy, so I asked her \"s'cuse me, do you happen to have the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies?\" She gave me a \"wtf are you talking about\" look and said \"we don't sell chocolate chip cookies here.\"\n\n I felt the tension and said thanks, and just got what I needed. When I was ready to make a choice of what foccacia I wanted, she ended up helping someone else when I was in line and was trying to get her attention. Great. I'm optimistic, because I loved this bakery so much. It only took me 10 minutes to get her attention before she could get what I needed and ring me up. I can't bring myself to knock them down more than one star. I probably just came across a cranky cashier, but I've had better experiences here.

Certain items aren't available at times (many an early morning I've wished for griddle bread and many a morning I've happily settled for scones instead).

Needless to say, she's been on my mind all day. But as usual, I managed to pretend that she's off having adventures in NYC or LA, as she was wont to do--and we simply hadn't had time to catch up in a while. ;)\n\nBut when I was in the Richmond this foggy evening to appease my hunger for dim sum and roast duck, I got a bit of a wake up call. I didn't think anything could stop me from my mission--but John Campbell's Irish Bakery did. Stopped me dead in my tracks, it did. \n\nThe green storefront with a window display full of baked goods suddenly brought back memories of the time Erin and I took a 17-hour ferry ride from France to Ireland just for the hell of it. It was the first time she'd visited the country of her ancestors, and though our stay was brief, we met some colorful characters and had an amazingly fun time, as we always did.\n\nWhen I stepped inside the bakery, I encountered another display of baked goods, both savory and sweet. There were several types of pasties and shepherd's pie, along with sweets like cream-filled scones and various fruit tarts. I selected the beef pastie and a rhubarb tart to go. The pastie--which was ground beef in a flavorful gravy with carrots and peas encased in a flaky half-moon crust--was perfect for the cool evening. And the rhubarb tart, with a buttery sugared crust in the shape of a shamrock, was a wonderful balance of tart and sweet.\n\nIf I'd had time, I would have loved to have stopped next door at The Blarney Stone to raise a pint of Guinness to Erin. But I think there will be other opportunities for that whenever I'm in the Richmond. :)\n\nErin go bragh!", "author": "Julie K."}

We always make the half-hour bus ride from the BART on the 38 just for John Campbell's!\n\nWe've tried a lot of the breads, cookies, sandwiches, and sweets by now. I'll go through the foods we've tried in a list...\n\nApple Puffs: These are the most amazing bits of baked heaven on Earth ever!!! If I'm making a trip down to the Richmond District just for John Campbell's, I always call to make sure they have them in that day... the apple filling is light and delicious, and the pastry is to-die-for. Flaky on the outside, chewy and moist on the inside, lightly coated with crunchy sugar... it makes for all sorts of amazing chewing sensations to go along with the divine taste. Oh god apple puffs, I miss them already.\n\nMince Puffs: Same pastry as the apple puffs, but I find the filling a little too strong for me. They add some spices and dried fruit for this puff; not my thing, but I think that's a matter of taste.\n\nRaisin soda bread: $5 loaf of slightly sweet, delicious soda bread littered with raisins that makes for a few great breakfasts. Mmmmm.\n\nPotato bread: I haven't seen this the last few times I've been, but these slices of savory potato-flavored bread were really tasty. A good addition to a lunch or dinner.\n\nScones: Yumm! Delicious and fresh. They have a really satisfying consistency to bite into, and are flavored just right. Not buttery or dense, but a little bit lighter and breadier. I like the style :)\n\nCookies: The shortbread cookies I've gotten have all been buttery and delicious. The small ones are usually a quarter each and are great little snacks, just the right amount of sweetness, and great buttery flavor. Mmmm.\n\nShepherd's Pie: Great on a cold day. They'll heat it up for you and get it all packed for you to take to go. There's a playground a few blocks away (Argonne Playground), which is sadly the closest available public seating... but the pie is delicious if you eat it right after they've heated it up. The mashed potato crust is delicious and smooth, and the meat is spiced just right (not too strong).\n\nBreakfast sandwiches: I had the Belfast Bap with my girlfriend one time, and it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever, ever had. Bap is an amazing bread, chewy on the inside under a firm crust, and they packed sausages, bacon, eggs, and a light addition of cheese into an amazing sandwich.

When you walk in the storefront, expect to be surrounded by a plethora of foreign food. My savory faves for lunch or dinner include the foccacia sandwich, potato bacon mushroom brie, and veggie currie pastie. \n\nThe sweets will satisfy any sweet tooth (as a sugarholic I consider myself an expert on such matters). My greatest sweet addiction here is the chocolate chip cream filled scone - a fresh baked chocolate chip full scone split in half, filled with fresh made whip cream and dabbed with raspberry jam (wowzers!). There's also plain and blueberry varieties. Snowballs are delicious and even more so heated up for 15-20 seconds in the microwave - instant coconut covered cakeballs! There's a variety of tarts to choose from (which you can mix 'n match 5 for $10) with my favorite being the almond raspberry tart.\n\nThe raspberry tea cookies are sweet, buttery; hard to eat just one but at 25 cents each at least its affordable to indulge. I have also found the combination of Barry's tea w/ cream and chocolate chip scones for breakfast a very satisfying breakfast combination. The cinnamon and sugar griddle cake is also nice for breakfast. It's similar in taste to a donut but not fried so healthier!\n\nThe store offers a wide range of breads. The pesto sun-dried tomato bread is fantastic but even better when you add hot pepper (or your choice) cheese toasted in the oven! The celtic almond bread is another fave loaded with almonds and full of marzipan. Finally, I recommend toasting chocolate-cherry bread in the oven and then adding a few scoops of vanilla ice cream (mmmm). \n\nVegetarian Friendly Meals (NOT VEGAN)\n-creamy tomato mushroom foccacia slice\n-pesto artichoke foccacia slice\n-vegetable currie pastie\n-not officially vegetarian, but I pick the bacon off the potato mushroom brie and foccacia sandwiches (be prepared for some serious dissection work)\n\nVEGAN breads\n-Irish Crusty Bread\n-Mini Irish Crusty Bread\n-Belfast Bap Bread\nThese breads are all similar to French bread and good for sandwiches or with soup.", "author": "K H."}

However, while inside, they had tastings of the most amazing double chocolate almond filled cakes. I tried some and was blown away, so chocolately, so flakey crusty, so sweet coconutty with a gracious blend of vanilla/almond filling.

And if you've been lucky enough to be transported back in time by something as innocent as a smell or taste would you want to share that pleasure with others? If you answered yes and are looking for just such an experience there is a little store front bakery in San Francisco's Richmond District that will take you back in time when you walk through the front door.\n\nIf you've ever wondered where to buy Irish scones (real Irish scones) or Irish brown bread (real Irish brown bread) there is a place outside of Ireland, next to a bar called The Blarney Stone on Geary Blvd. It is an Irish bakery started two years ago by a product of Belfast's legendary apprentice system. Master Baker John Campbell holds an Order of The Master Baker from Belfast City and a Guilds Bakery Certificate. \n\nWhat this means to you and me is an honest to God trained journeyman Irish baker who specializes in aromatic flavorful time machines of authentic Irish baked goods that will send you to the stony fields of Eire for as little as a $1 per scone or $5 for a loaf of brown bread, (which must be experienced warm with a slather of crunchy peanut butter to truly understand what it means to live in a smoky thatched roofed cottage ringed by dry stone walls built eons ago by hands unseen). A modest well made scone or slice of warm brown bread can be a powerful thing.  \n\nScoff you may, guffaw you might, but having lived in Ireland for eight years as a teenager I feel qualified to vouch for just how real and authentic the baked goods are that Mr. Campbell is producing locally. The storefront is also authentically Irish with its style of font and window display. And if you really want to know how good Johns scones are try muscling your way through the throngs of elderly Chinese ladies that habituate the bakery as if they owned the place. That's how good this bakery is; you have to fight your way past people of other nationalities to get to your own.\n\nOf special note are the raisin scones, soda and brown breads, sausage rolls with either pork or beef sausage filling and the raspberry chocolate bread. Oh my God the raspberry chocolate bread... and yes it tastes as good as it sounds. John also makes Guinness bread, traditional pasties, soups and rhubarb crumble. Walking into Campbell's Irish Bakery is walking into the middle of a time in your life you most likely have forgotten or maybe never had; that time when a sensation of smell and taste turned you into a humble believer in things greater than yourself.  \n\nOne way or another sampling John's baked goods will reignite pleasant memories and transport you to a place far far away from your current state of mind for a fraction of the cost of a vacation. Pamper yourself this spring and take a trip to a mountainside that slopes into a sheltered bay where little white cottages pepper the landscape as they have for centuries. Experience the aromas and flavors of food that has been perfected over the centuries and is a product of a country that has populated the United States with people, music and food, great food.

I wasn't particularly enamoured of the raspberry chocolate, but I devoured the blueberry with gusto.  The chocolate chip was also very nice, with a pleasant dough to chocolate ratio.  Chocolate chip scones have a way of disappointing me because I invariably compare them to chocolate chip cookies, but I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.  I bought a half dozen because I couldn't resist purchasing 6 for $6, so the raisin and irish liquor scones are waiting to be devoured.\n\nThe only thing that didn't agree with me was the hot cross bun.

I always loved this place until recent months. I usually get morning coffee and misc bites there. I like the feel of the place and usually the staff is friendly and is a great way to start the day. But recently, one of the newer face there just makes ridiculous and illogical demands. Only her too. One time, they ran out of the big cup for coffee and only had the small cups. So I got a small coffee but she insisted that cup was the large size and I should pay the large amount. The cup is obviously the small. I get coffee there every morning. Difference is hmmm obvious. I disagreed and after some awkward moments, she relented. Then this morning, they only had the small cup again. When I went to pay the small, she said it is two dollars (price of the large) and I thought maybe they raised their prices. So I paid. On my way out I asked her are they not going to have two sizes anymore? She said no. They just ran out of the other cups.  What????? So you raised my small cup of coffee by more than 30 percent because you didn't buy big cups to offer that day?  I didn't get more coffee that day. Why should I pay more? John Campbell. Listen to your customer, correct this business behavior that crooks use. I told her there is no logic to this and I left. Quite frankly, it's 50 cent.

I bought scones, Guinness bread, potato bread and my boyfriend bought a Belfast Bap (sausage/bacon/egg/cheese sandwich).  Altogether we spent around $15, so it was relatively cheap.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing we got was very moving.  The scones were decent, though much different than an average scone.  If anything, they were a bit plain.  The potato bread, again, was on the plain side, though it did have a good, dense texture.  The Guinness bread was, in my opinion, the best of the lot--with cranberries popping with flavor and some nuts (walnuts, I think, if I remember correctly), in addition to a slightly Guinness-y flavor.\n\nOverall, John Campbell's Irish Bakery was good, in a simple and sort of plain way.

If I was just too late to see them, someone let me know). \nAnyway, thanks to the free samples, I found out their brown bread is great - quite substantial and hearty. There was another type of bread (I have unfortunately forgotten the name, which is something unusual that I hadn't heard of before - farl?) that was just about the opposite, but also very good - very light and fluffy, and would probably be quite pleasant with jam. The chocolate chip cookies were too buttery for my liking (although they were good - just not my type). There were a couple more things out, so, great selection of samples.\nDon't worry, I did actually purchase something - scones and tea cookies.

I can't believe I've lived in the neighborhood for three years and haven't popped into this bakery until the last month. I now have a difficult time keeping myself from stopping by this friendly spot every single day. I mean that. Every.Single.Day.\n\nI've traveled a few times to Ireland and I don't even think the baked goods there taste as scrumptious as this authentic bakery. I can't think of a better dessert to take to a dinner party than a plate of their small tarts--all of them are delicious, but the raspberry almond stole my heart from the beginning. The scones--oh my--I could go on and on. Try their plain scone (slightly sweet, terribly fluffy and light) with lemon curd and cream at your next afternoon tea at home. The chocolate chip and blueberry scones are at the top of my list, too. \n\nThe last three visits, I've not been able to pass up the healthier sweet potato muffin, maybe the best muffin in town. Made with wheat germ, bran, loads of sweet potato, and not much sugar, these are some of the moistest, most delicious breakfast treats I've ever had. I have to keep myself from buying the jumbo muffin and settle for the regular size. \n\nNever leave without a chocolate chip cookie, either. I haven't tasted many that are as good as these. \n\nThe customer service is fantastic, and most days you can sample some of the bestsellers, as the kind folks behind the counter enjoy showing off their fare as much as I enjoy eating it! \n\nDon't miss their daily soup specials, either. This place gives new meaning to split pea soup. And take home a loaf of their soda or brown bread for your next carb fest. What a gem on less-than-quaint Geary Street.", "author": "Catherine P."}

However, one of them followed my friend and I into the bakery. After asking him for a pastry which I had previously seen in the window, he replied in an incredibly rude tone that they had never stocked such an item.\n\nFeeling that he may be unfamiliar with the name of this basic Irish pastry, I described them to him after which he was still unfamiliar with it but didn't offer any kind of similar alternative.\n\nI said, \"Oh, I must have been mistaken\", to which he replied in an extremely patronising and vicious manner, \"yes, I think you are!\"\n\nAll the while his equally threatening and unfriendly mate was circling behind us making faces.\n\nPerhaps the management should make better staffing choices or at least offer a training session in basic courtesy and customer service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-22", "description": "Pasties fit for the gods...their curry and chicken pasty ($4.75) could be the best pasty I have ever had (though it's hard to find pasties so my pasty experiences have been few and far between...I did make it to BJ Bulls for pasties before they closed though).  They're made by John Campbell who holds the \"Order of Master Baker from Belfast and the City and Guilds Bakery Certificate.\"  The chicken curry is superb.  I could eat it over rice.  It's surprisingly spicy and complex.  The chicken cubes are tender and the filling includes peas, carrots, and red bell peppers.  The crust is flaky and thin.  The chicken & vegetable pasty is similar but mild and just like chicken pot pie (which I adore) but in pasty form.  The filling is creamy and rich.  So good.  They also have a beef & vegetable pasty which is very good but my least favorite.  It is ground beef and not much else (some carrots and peas).  Right now there are three pasty varieties, I'm hoping for more in the future - like beef & curry would be brilliant, steak, and lamb too.  \n\nThe scones are great too but the pasties are out of this world.  The plain round scone is buttery (but not too much so) and golden on top.  It holds its shape pretty well (rather than being a crumbly scone).  I think it could be a tad more tender. Reminds me of a sweeter buttermilk biscuit.\n\nThe Irish brown bread ($5) is fantastic.  Nutty, multi-grained, chewy.  It screams for butter and some strong coffee.\n\nThe coffee (Jeremiah's Pick) is strong but has a bitter, overly acidic aftertaste.  They have lattes and Celtic iced coffee as well.  And the employees  (owners?) have Irish accents.  Very cute.  \n\nI'm excited to try the shepherd's pie ($6), breakfast sandwich (Belfast Bap), sausage rolls ($2.95), custard tarts, cream buns, fresh cream filled scones and the Irish bread (soda bread, potato bread, batch bread).  They also sell bagged Irish potato chips (or crisps) by Tayto.\n\nThey've been open for four months and I don't think they're that well known yet.  I predict long lines in the future.  It isn't cheap but the ingredients are imported and the quality makes it worth the paying more for.  \n\nOn weekends (10 AM - 3 PM) they have a brunch menu served next door at the Blarney Stone Pub, and it includes the traditional Irish breakfast, Irish sausage, Irish bacon, and Irish pudding.\n\nSuch a brilliant idea...Irish pubs are a dime a dozen in SF but how many Irish bakeries are there?  One.  John Campbell's.  Why didn't someone think of this before?   John Campbell, I love you.\n\nUpdate (2/27):  They no longer make lattes and espresso drinks.  And it's cash only.", "author": "Lolia S."}

This place opened last week - I found out about it through the www.misterarcher.com review and I have honestly gone back everyday. I may be a sucker for tasters (and they regularly have six different tasters out) so I may be slightly biased, but everything in this place is amazing. The apple puffs are heavenly, the griddle bread is ridiculously doughy and delicious, and the potato bread is like nothing I've ever tasted before and I can't understand why this isn't a dietary staple. Seriously, you could even pass it off as a vegetable (potatoes. . . anyone?). Anyway, I've tried everything - even the mince pie (which tastes like a double stuffed gourmet fig newton).

Make sure you try the blueberry scones and the brown bread. Warning: they are both highly addictive. All the goods are homemade and, as you can imagine, the color green is pervasive.

The pasties (no, not that kind of pasty--the hand-held pot-pie kind) are perfectly cooked, with a golden exterior and a nice ratio of vegetables and/or meat to sauce on the interior. I especially recommend the chicken curry pasty. I don't normally think spicy when I think of Irish food, but the curry gives it a nice kick to the traditional, modestly seasoned pasty. Finally, their garlic cheese bread gave me a true food-gasm. It was so good that it took all of my willpower to keep me from eating the whole loaf right there on the street.

They also have delicious cookies, breakfast bread, and tarts.  The workers have always been helpful to me, and they always have samples.  One time I went with a friend and my husband, and they let us have a whole tart for a sample.  This is a great place to stock up on quick breakfasts for the week, or bring your mom and dad when they visit you.", "author": "Chastidy R."}

I had it when it was fresh from the oven and still warm. I could have eaten the whole loaf in one sitting. The owner was very sweet and gave my daughter some cookies while I was looking around. Will definitely go back when we're in the area.", "author": "Keromi K."}

What brought me back is the service and conversation. Recently the bakery had extended their hours to stay open until 10:00 P.M.  which is perfect for a procrastinators (like me). But the smartest thing the bakery EVER did was put that hilarious, skinny, black haired guy behind the counter. I went in for a Bap the other night after work and he had me rolling! After a long day at work listening to my annoying co-workers the only thing that could ease my troubled mind is a Bap and a joke from that guy. When I was there, people were coming over from the bar next door to buy food just because that guy was so funny. One ambitious morning I decided to wake early and hit J.C.'s for a pre-work Bap thinking maybe some laughter before work would help me get through the day! But the funny guy, the best part of J.C.'s wasn't working. I bought the Bap, but after eating, I still missed the uplifting fun I usually had when patroning JC's. Short version: Go to J.C.'s  in the evening, when that skinny, funny guy is working, or don't go there at all.", "author": "ben b."}

But the reviews were positive, and I'm always up for adventure, so we gave it a go. It was the great surprise of my vacation. Two words: mincemeat tarts. Holy cow! Tangy and sweet, but not cloying, with a delicate crust. Unbelievably good...I want one every day. The Guinness bread was also a delight, dry with walnuts and cranberries. Probably would have been better toasted with a bit of butter, but being in a hotel, we couldn't find out. The veggie pastie was flaky and filled with curry and vegetables, not overly spicy, but warming. I can imagine it would make a great lunch on a wintry day. I wasn't as into the apple tart as the micnemeat...it was a bit too sweet. But the man behind the counter was really patient and helpful, and even threw in a few extra tarts. If I could give a 4.5 I would, taking off only for a lack of seating. My pastie was heated for me to eat it, but I had to enjoy in the car. I will be back, Mr. John Campbell. Have some mincemeat waiting for me.", "author": "lisa s."}
