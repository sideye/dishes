For a cute little taco shop/bar by Golden Gate Park, this place is so amazing along with unbelievably fantastic service.\n\nThis review is for the time I went here about 1-2 weeks ago (which is my third or fourth time coming to this place now). I went here to take my friend out for his birthday. We went on a Thursday night around 7pm, and it was PACKED! I mean we couldn't even find a place to sit! Now, when you walk into any place that is packed, you automatically know it's good. We roamed around the bar to find a spot; didn't get lucky at first, so we waited behind the people sitting at the bar and stood against the wall.\n\nThis one bartender/server (didn't catch her name, but I think she was blonde?) noticed us right away and told us she would take care of us whenever we were ready to order. I thought that was really nice because usually when you're waiting for a spot at any bar, you don't really get service until you sit down; so that was super nice of her to do that. Immediately after that though, these people that were sitting right in front of us got up from the chairs and we snatched them right away (thank goodness, such perfect timing!).\n\nThroughout the time of us being there, she just always made sure we were doing okay. We even had other bartenders check up on us if she couldn't, and I thought that was great too. Very attentive, fast service.\n\nI had the shrimp tacos and they were absolutely delicious. I am also a huge sangria fan, and man their sangria's are strong! But they are really good as well. I still haven't tried their burritos so I can't wait to try one next time :)", "author": "Kanella G."}

I'll start with the cons. I got Nick's taco with chicken, which was a crispy taco shell inside of a soft taco shell with pulled chicken and guac. The chicken tasted weird and soggy, and the corn tortilla on the inside definitely tasted stale. Also, the taco fell apart as soon as I touched it, basically. My boyfriend had a chorizo burrito and had some of the same problems--it was very very soggy, messy to eat even with the foil, and the chorizo tasted weird.\n\nThere were some pros: the iced tea they serve is real, brewed tea that tasted fresh. Also, their guac is great and is definitely the best of both worlds in terms of texture. It's somehow right in between chunky guac and smooth guac, which is sure to make both sides happy. Also, this seems to be a great bar if you're a fan of Mexican alcohol. They do Mezcal and tequila flights and have several margaritas to choose from. The service was great too, as the server was friendly and our food came out suuuuuuper fast!\n\nI'd probably come back, but not for the food. I think the Taco Shop would be a good place to go drinking, and the food would be better if you've had a Mezcal flight or two.", "author": "Claire C."}

The quesadilla came out a bit greasy, not so much from the cheese but the tortilla was probably coated in oil/butter when cooked.  My 4-year niece had no problems eating it, greasy or not! \n- Baja Style fish tacos $5.50 and to add \"Nick's Way\" is an additional $1.50 - \"Nick's Way\" means to add a crispy corn tortilla, cheese and guacamole.

The taco was super yummy and it had cheese, pico degallo and guacamole. You can also order with some pinto beans but I'm not a big fan of beans so I didn't order with it. Just a warning, this is a pretty big taco and super filling! The tacos are wrapped in a soft tortilla and on the outside there's a crispy tortilla! (You're almost getting two tacos in one!) The corn on the cob was also another amazing side dish. The Elote is covered in lime salsa and cheese and some cayenne peppers. I've honestly never had a corn on the cob before so I can't compare it to anything but I think this was the best style of corn I've ever ate in my life lol. The corn was super sweet and juicy. The chips & guac was also good. Nothing special. \nThe agua fresca margarita was pretty strong and refreshing. Although we were both kind of light weight so we were a bit tipsy.\n\nOther than, service was good. The worker checked up on us and we definitely enjoyed our food. The food also came out pretty quick which also deserves another star. :) \n\nI will be back again soon!!", "author": "Monica W."}

I honestly haven't had Baja-style Mexican food this delicious since we went to Cabo--this is the real deal (well, okay, this is a lot pricier than what you'd get in Cabo or any place in the Mission...but you get what you pay for)!\n\nI highly recommend the fish taco with guac--each bite was flavorful and satisfying. The fish was fried perfectly crispy on the outside and was exquisitely flaky on the inside. Perfect. \n\nThe chorizo quesadilla was even more mindblowing. I normally take pictures of all my food but I failed to do so this time because the presentation of this beauty overwhelmed all my senses. The plate simply smelled fantastic. The whole wheat tortilla was simultaneously soft yet crispy, barely cradling the juicy bits of paprika-spiced chorizo, cheese, and pico de gallo. I love my Mexican food sloppy, wet, greasy, and this quesadilla delivered just that--I used about ten napkins per bite.\n\nUnderdog's is no underdog...definitely come here to enjoy American- and Baja-inspired Mexican in a fun atmosphere!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-09", "description": "I've long resisted visiting The Taco Shop as I generally prefer a more traditional taqueria. Yesterday things finally lined up such that I ended up eating at The Taco Shop anyway, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI thought the street tacos were, well, lackluster. The tortillas were just sort of bland and steamed and became soggy very fast. The fillings were alright, though. The carne asada and the chorizo were both quite good. The pulled chicken would be better served in a sort of traditional sit down Mexican joint context- a freshly fried chewy/crispy tortilla, cheese, and lettuce.\n\nThe Nick's style taco was definitely a more appealing option. The thing is basically a half burrito. It's actually a cool, if non-traditional, format.\n\nAnd lastly, I treated myself to a California burrito with carne asada and (as recommended by the waiter) added the baja sauce to that.\n\nNow, I usually don't usually care for a California burrito. I prefer rice. But, I'm a San Diego native and have been craving carne asada fries (the true traditional food of San Diego alongside the fish taco). While The Taco Shop doesn't do carne asada fries, a California burrito with carne asadad is the same thing but wrapped in a big-ass tortilla.\n\nAgain, the tortilla game threw me for a loop. Apparently, burritos only come in whole wheat tortillas. This is a weird choice. I mean, let's be clear ; this is about as white as a taco spot can get. But still, whole wheat only? Nonsense. In their defense, they did a bang up job keeping that tortilla nice and chewy and stretchy and the carne asada and the fries were both pretty fucking tasty. Big ups to the waiter for recommending the baja sauce, as well. It was a clutch move, though it may be too rich for some in this context.\n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty and affordable and clean without being polite or bland. I was also stuck with a very delightful, nostalgic Southern California vibe.\n\nFor me, when it comes to Mexican food I'm usually a single issue voter: how good is the al pastor? But even with no al pastor on the menu and whole wheat tortillas on the burritos, I'll gladly be back.", "author": "Austin M."}

Like no lie, my boyfriend and I were outside at 9pm without a jacket and we were still fine. And warm nights apparently called for beer and tacos so we took our butts to Underdogs. \n\nLocated on Irving, parking could be a pain if you decide to come here before 6pm. Any later and maybe you'll have good luck? My boyfriend and I struggled a bit and ended up parking 4 blocks away but it was a nice night so we're not complaining.\n\nWe were super confused right off the bat. I knew that Underdogs was part of a bar but I didn't think it would all be mixed together. I thought there would be a separate window for tacos, but nope. There are tables all the way to the back that are first come first serve if you wish to sit back and enjoy your food. \n\nService was amazing. I am super grateful for Magz (here's hoping that was her real name on the receipt) because I told her it was our first time there and we were confused on how to go about ordering food as that was the main goal and she broke everything down for us and told us the top choices for food (including doing it Nick's way) as well as gave us a drink menu just in case. She was patient and even continued to check in on us after we were seated. And upon hearing it was our first time, she gave us some free chips and salsa! Bless her for working there, she's my favorite already. \n\nThe food was definitely a bit pricey. But then again it's located in San Francisco so I have to try to understand that. My boyfriend and I both got their 3 tacos plate with carnitas, carne asada, and chicken and then I added an order of the elote which the kitchen ended up splitting in half so both my boyfriend and I got our own piece. The food was all good especially with their salsas, the only downside really was that the chicken was sort of dry. If anything, we'll probably stick to the carnitas or carne asada tacos next time. \n\nOverall, good eats for a warm night! It does get super loud in here with the music blasting but who needs to hear what their friends are saying when you're busy stuffing your face with food right?", "author": "Venus L."}

I heard about the hype with this place and definitely wanted to come and try it for myself. I have to say that I'm really, really torn. I came with high expectations and wanted so bad to like this place, but I left disappointed. I've had legit street tacos from Mexico which were incredible so it's hard, once you've had amazing, nothing else can seem to compete. \n\nOn a side note: seriously who charges for sour cream? \n\n1) Mexican Street-Style Tacos(Carne Asada + Carnitas): $2/each on Tuesdays (as opposed to $7.95/3 tacos regularly). The carne asada was cooked nicely, but the carnitas was really dry. They're essentially the smallest tacos I have ever seen and they just contain meat, onions, and cilantro. By itself there isn't much flavor, the sauces they provide on the table do help to make it a bit more flavorful. I think tacos should be good on its own while the sauce merely helps to enhance it not completely bring the only flavor it has. $2 worth of a taco? eh. $2 worth of flavor? eh. I wouldn't order again.  \n\n2) I've been hearing people talk constantly about Nick's taco and I finnnallly got to try it!\nNick's Way (Carne Asada, $5.75): it was a pretty tasty combination, I definitely like the crisp from the tortilla. Was I amazed? Not as much as I had hoped. I was expecting to be mindblowned by the flavor, but really it just tastes like a burrito with tortilla chips built to look like a taco. It's a hit or miss depending on how you like your tacos. \n\nPARKING: street, I parked near the library which was free, except on Wednesdays 6am-8am. On Irving itself, there are metered parking. You could also park on the residential areas. \n\nSERVICE: great, very quick! Once you go in, you basically find your own table if one is open, or  you can sit by the bar. We had no trouble finding a place to sit, even on Taco Tuesday! \n\nOverall, the tacos here were okay. I hate to say it because the service was great and they're really great people. Everyone's experience will be different of course.", "author": "Vivian S."}

A wide selection of beer, delicious tacos (Nick's Way!), and a basketball arcade game at the back make this one of my favorite sports bars to go to. So when the Giants had a crucial game against the Los Angeles Losers (formally known as the Dodgers), I put on my orange and black and walked into The Taco Shop expecting a hell of a good time again.\n\nAnd then the bartender happened.\n\nMaybe she was having a bad day. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially when they're in the service industry. But that wasn't the case. She was flashing smiles to everyone else and reserving the nose-ring RBF just for us.\n\nOr oh shoot, maybe I was wearing a Dodgers hat by mistake! Naw. Looked up at my hat and it was as orange&black as the blood running through my veins.\n\nSo why was she so mean to us? Why was she so curt to us like her name Curt Schilling? Why did she tell us to stand at a place where there's no angle to watch the game, but welcomed other folks who stood at the exact same place afterwards? And why did she have to give my friend a \"smh\" and a valley girl eye roll when he mistakenly asked her to close out his tab?\n\nAgain, the Taco Shop is great (and for the record, the hostess, bouncer, and the other bartenders were really friendly as well). But I don't pay $20 for a pitcher for it to come with a side of attitude. There are other cheaper establishments to choose from (Bus Stop, Blarney Stone, Dragon Lounge, Yancy's, Nelly's, etc.), and they are usually equipped with a team of bartenders that smiles. \n\nI'm going to miss the tacos and the atmosphere, but sorry Taco Shop, I won't come back because I deserve better than that RBF bartender.", "author": "Ringo M."}

Got there early to get a table and got a pretty cold reception from the waitress. We let other people sit at our table since we had room and the whole time we were there she neglected to check on us if we needed anything. We wanted to order food and drinks but never got the chance to and we did order she had a pretty bad attitude. Ordered one taco and it took 20-35 min to arrive. I know it takes a bit of time when it's busy, but when you see the people next to you order after you and get their food before you , it's pretty upsetting. We ordered shots from the latin waiter. We ordered 3 different shots and when he came back with the shots my friend asked which one was which and his reply was \"smell them.\" \n\nWhen I got the bill they charged me for a drink we didn't order. And the manager, Max, came to us to explain what happened. I then proceed to tell him the service was a bit lacking today and his response was \"I don't give a shit\" \n\nPretty baffled that you would curse at a paying customer. Totally unprofessional. \n\nWe've been coming here for years and we love the atmosphere during games. Food here is great. But it sucks that the service brings this place down. Forget this place.

What can I say, I'm just not a huge fan of the loud and rowdy scene... it feels  a bit like a college party sometimes.\n\nThe \"Vegetariano\" burrito is really delicious, although more of a wrap than a burrito since it has shredded cabbage and no rice. As a result, it's not super filling so I'd recommend getting a side if you're really hungry. I asked them to add rice to the vegetariano recently and was informed that their rice is made with chicken stock, so vegans and vegetarians beware. \n\nOh - and the red salsa is the beeeeeeeest.

I think I expected to give this place 5 stars based on all of the Yelp reviews but once again I learned that you can't always count on everyone else's opinions.  \n\nThis place was PACKED on game day, which did give it a really fun vibe while everyone was cheering for their respective teams. Luckily our friends had a table saved otherwise we probably wouldn't have found a seat at all. We ordered drinks and I got a fish taco, \"Nick's Way.\" It was massive. You'll notice in the photo I posted that the avocado is slathered all over it (which is absolutely not a bad thing) and it's kind of spilling out of the wrap that it comes in to hold the taco together. I wasn't planning on getting it Nick's way, but the waitress highly recommended it so I felt a little obliged to try it out.\n\nTo explain Nick's Way: and additional $1.25 will get you tons of guacamole, cheese, and salsa. It will also give you a second (hard) shell around your taco. This is the part that ruined it a little for me. My outer shell was so hard that it was almost too tough to bite into, and therefore my force led to my taco spilling all over the place. I think next time I would get Nick's way without the second shell, or just add avo to my taco instead so it's not too overwhelming.\n\nCool atmosphere if you liked packed places for game day and decent food, but the service was pretty slow on the day I went (granted it could have been because it was so crowded, but I repeatedly saw our waitress going to the same table to check on them and rarely came over to ours).

I removed the outer shell, as one was more than good enough and held the taco together just fine.

I came in last night and I was digging the place; it was a busy Monday night and it looked like a good bar to hang out in. As a bartender myself, I would NEVER treat my patrons the way these guys treated my date and I last night. First, they were ignoring us at the bar, even though I had clearly hailed the guy and all five of them saw that I was ready. When I work, I greet and serve all my customers as promptly as I can. M Unless when its a super busy night, and even then I acknowledge people who come in and make sure they know I'll get to them. I can chit chat with my coworkers and take orders, its called multi-tasking. Finally, one of them comes to us and we place our order. I get a Michelada and some other food. Granted I was already peeved at the service from the guys behind the bar so I ordered to go. Tell me why my Michelada was extra spicy? No matter how annoyed I am when Im on the clock, quality comes first and I would never purposely mess anyone Im serving, and trust me, I've wanted to do that many times before. That just makes you look like a bad bartender. We get our order, and my date decided he wanted to eat at the bar because I had my shitty drink, and well, we might as well. The douche bartender that serves us proceeded to scold us about how we: \"can eat here, but its just that you just made me waste a bag and plastic utensils, and I have to plate the dish now, but you can eat, not trying to kick you out or anything.\" Well guess what dude? You were, and I didn't wanna start a fight and ruin everyone else's night so my date and I packed our stuff and left... \n\nFirst of all, I paid for the paper bag, there was a bag tax on my receipt which means its mine and I can do with it what I want, along with all the plastic accoutrement that was given to me. Do you buy all the bar supplies yourself? No. Your boss does, so whats it to yah bro? Second of all, yes, it might be annoying when my patrons do that, but I would NEVER say that to those Im serving. My date and I didn't ask you to plate the food, nor did we ask you for silverware; we were trying to be as chill about it as possible. So what was the problem here? Are you new and not know how to treat people? Did your team lose tonight? Is it cuz we were a gay couple trying to dine at your \"hetero\" sports bar? Are you just a dick? \n\nAnd not only that, but my date and I tipped this kid... Not only did I get shitty customer service, a bad drink thats not hard to make (Rim glass with tajin, pour in ice, a little over 3/4 beer, the rest bloody mary mix, garnish with lime... Einstein), and a rude ass bartender, but we tipped this guy out too. I'm getting angry again writing this so I'll end it here.

It's beer battered fish in a crispy tortilla layered on with a soft tortilla and melted Monterey jack cheese to hold it all together. It's topped with a generous amount of pico de gallo and fresh guac. It gets a little messy when you start working on it and can get a little soggy.\n\nOne taco always is the perfect amount to get me full with a little more room for an elote.

A little less attentive than usual BUT let me break it down one time:\n\n- CHEESEBURGER  BURRITO( ~$10): Hot damn, this thing is like a California burrito except with a Kobe beef patty con queso chopped up and wrapped with French fries and jalape\u00f1os. This is a big time burrito; I couldn't even finish it! That's definitely saying something.\n\n- GUAC AND CHIPS (~$7): I'm not sure if these were actually that amazing or if the drunchies kicked in. Either way, the guac was solid and the chips were fresh. I'm not a fan of the tomato salsa layer between the guac and the chips because it made everything kind of soggy towards the end.\n\n- FULL BAR: In case the Corner Spot didn't do me in, Underdog's full bar definitely put me on the ropes. Touch\u00e9.\n\n- STRONG SERVICE: Servers would come by every 5-10 minutes to make sure we were taken care of. I started to wonder if the service was that good or if I looked like I was in constant need of assistance. Either way, I like the attention.\n\n- OTHER STUFF: There's a basketball arcade game like the ones at D&B where I can get wrecked at.. I mean wreck people at. Two blocks from the N MUNI. \n\nAll in all, I was a happy camper at the end of the night. Seating can be a pain because they restaurant / bar isn't very big but that's San Francisco for ya.", "author": "Chris W."}

They are loaded with tasty goodness and have the perfect crunchy/soft bite ratio, making them one of a kind. The burritos are good enough, but not really authentic. If you must, go for the breakfast burrito. \n\nI can vouch for the beer, sangria and surprisingly, bloody mary. The one time I ordered a margarita, I didn't enjoy it at all, so I haven't ordered one since. \n\nThe biggest con for me is the salsa. It's pretty average. I really wish at least one of them was spicy. \n\nIt's a casual place that seems to have a steady flow of people regularly. I often see people with their kids there during the day, so I guess I would consider it a pretty tame sports bar. Taco Tuesday is a little too overcrowded for me, so I'll pass. \n\nTake-out is a great option too. It's always ready fast and they give you chips and salsa free of charge!", "author": "Gloria B."}

While they're delicious, I mostly go for a San Diego burrito (pico de gallo, cheese, guacamole, with carne asada, carnitas, or pollo) when I actually come for the food.

At the time, I rated Nick's 4/5 stars. However, I've lived in SD for the past two out of three years, and living so close to the US-Mexican border I've tasted what I consider authentic, quality tacos (The Taco Stand in LA Jolla for my friend, and Oscar's in various SD locations for me). Underdog's does not even compare. \n\nOur party of three ordered one carnitas taco and one corn on the cob. The guacamole was both generous and delicious, but the meat was tougher than expected and the tortilla was too thick. As my fellow SD compatriot stated, it's a good taco, but falls in the middle in the spectrum of taco goodness. The corn on the cob fared a bit better. It was creamy with light parmesan, but I definitely doused it in Tapatio. I've had better Mexican corn at local street fairs in Socal (I'm talking about you, Downtown Anaheim street fair!).\n\nOverall, good service and a decent-looking bar, but rated #1 sports bar in SF as a sign inside touted?

We drove like a block away from this place and lost our rlly cool parking spot THEN decided to give it another try. So we turned back around and found parking and walked in and just sat at the first place we saw that was empty (although it had dirty stuff on it). THEN we got serviced super fast and our orders taken. \nI ordered the Baja taco nicks way and my husband ordered the carne asada taco also w nicks way. \nThe wait wasn't long and it's the perfect date night place to go too. \nWhen the food finally came to us.

When our food came, I got a breakfast burrito with carne asada and my husband got one taco. We were hungry and didn't want to scream over the loudness of the place so we just ate it. My burrito was actually really good - hence the 3 stars. My husband did not enjoy his taco that he ended up eating half my burrito. \n\nIt's a bar, so I didn't dock stars for the loud atmosphere. Two stars docked because our orders came out wrong.", "author": "Serena F."}

I ordered a beer and we ordered three orders of tacos in total. \n\nAround 7-720 pm just as when the dunk contest was starting up, a waitress came up to us and politely asked us to vacate the table because there was a line of people waiting to get a table. We acquiesced however after spending over 30$, we could not even finish watching the event for which we came. While speaking to the waitress, we ended up missing part of the event. \n\nSo we ended up standing like a couple of bums hovering over some people and blocking the waiters while trying to catch the last moments of the event. Not what I had in mind to watch the event at the bar. \n\nThe tacos were ok for bar food. The atmosphere was typical, though the big TVs were in the back with tables and most of the people there were not really there to watch the sport events(from my observations). The TVs up front by the bar are on the smaller side.

I came here last night after doing some research. As of Feb 13, 2013, 2:40pm this is what their website says:\n\nSuper Bowl Special\n$20 for seat reservation, includes your first drink.\n\nTaco Tuesday 5pm to close:\n2 dollar Tacos\n2 dollar Tecates\n\nHappy Hour and 1/2 Monday to Friday 4:30 to 6pm\n2 dollar Street Tacos\n2 dollar Tecate\n\n1.00  Margaritas\nFriday 6:00-6:30\n$1.00 Margaritas\n\nI have no qualms about this. However, when we came here yesterday, TUESDAY, Feb 12th, 2013, this menu was not honored. I had to have been updated some time recently around the superbowl... right?\n\nWe entered this super packed place, and they had a list for seating. First thing I noticed was the heat. So much body heat. It was really uncomfortable. We were seated immediately luckily... and we ordered. \n\nMy friend ordered the Nick's Way Tacos, which we thought were the 2 dollar tacos...; instead she clarified that the 2 dollar tacos were the street tacos. \n\n1. The confusion comes in here because from their website, they have \"2 dollar Tacos\" and later they say \"2 dollar Street Tacos\"; this usually means there is a difference, and there are only 2 kinds of tacos on the menu... street and nick's way. \n2. Second, I asked if they had the 2 dollar tecates, and they said no, it's 3 dollars now. Should have paid the premium for another beer because Tecate tastes like crap, but for 2 dollars, eh. \n\nWe get our food, which takes forever, which is excusable, because of how packed it is. However when the food comes, these street tacos are super small. Not worth it at all. The chicken is extremely extremely dry. Don't get chicken. Carne Asada was alright at best.\n\nFinally, I ask for the check which comes quickly. However, it took about 5 minutes of waiving my credit card in the air and multiple waiters/waitresses passing me at least 7 times before one notices my flailing arm. \n\nI'm pretty sure I won't be returning for tacos ever again.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

The taco shop is situated inside a sports bar so set your expectations properly (don't take your date here, for example, unless they want to watch the warriors kick some ass). As for the tacos themselves, I definitely wasn't disappointed. The nicks way tacos with guac were pretty damn good. I got the carnitas, and my girlfriend got the shrimp taco + nicks way. They definitely don't skimp on the guac here as it was overflowing from the top. The salsas they provide on the table paired very well with the tacos. \n\nThe four stars is due to two reasons. The tacos are very top heavy, meaning that once you eat the guac/cheese/meat from the top, the bottom of the taco was basically just tortilla and some melted cheese. Actually on that note, I wish they gave me less guac and a little more of other filings (tomato, meat). The other reason is that I don't consider this place cheap in terms of tacos (carnitas was $5 and shrimp + nicks way was $7, and that's for ONE taco).\n\nIn any case I'll probably still come back here in the future.", "author": "Jinyan C."}

My boyfriend commented that it must have been good tequila because he could hardly even taste it. Wrong, to this day I wonder if their was ever tequila in the margaritas in general. Price? 45 bucks after tax meaning we paid per person about 11.25 per person for half a virgin margarita. \nThe manager came over and tried to explain the situation, to which I gave about zero fs about hearing. \nI work in a vaunted restaurant which prides itself on customer service, quality, quantity and sustainability.

There's a bouncer sitting in front of the shop that will ask for your ID. I think after a certain time of the day, it's only open to 21+... but don't take my word for it. My friend and I didn't have to wait long for a table although the hostess said it was going to be a 20-min wait. It was more like 3 minutes.\n\nThere were a handful of beer on tap but I chose Speakeasy and my friend chose Drakes ($6/pint). For food, we settled for one of the Baja fish taco, Nick's Way style ($5.95) and Nacho es muy Grande with carne asada ($12.95). The food and drinks arrived relatively quick! I swear it was no more than a 10-minute wait. And boy oh boy, was I in for a treat.\n\nThe nachos were HUMONGOUS. Literally a mountain of fried (seemed double-fried to me) tortilla chips covered in meat, salsa, jalape\u00f1os, and a very generous portion of guacamole. It also came with a side of sour cream on the side.

Long story short: not a spot for San Franciscans and especially not friendly to Latinx folks. (Be prepared to be ignored & offended if you're not a transplant) \n\nFor some reason, every time I go here the service is rude and the wait time is ridiculous. On more than one occasion, I waited longer than people who ordered after me and the wait staff have either given me attitude or my friends attitude. This past weekend was the LAST STRAW. \nI get that their demographic is for hipsters, but it should also be inviting to locals. \n\nIncident one: \nRude server complained as my friends and I were leaving because we wrote on the credit card 0 for tip since we left it in cash (even though he was inattentive and gave too much attitude when we asked for more rounds of shots). He then put his hand on my friends shoulder!!!! Then proceeded with his sarcastic tone \"just to let you know tips are obligatory not optional\". My friend immediately said \"don't touch me bro\" and was getting mad because this guy has been rude to us all evening!!!!! How inconsiderate! Tips are OPTIONAL and if he bothered to clear the table, we left it in CASH on the table. 18% too.... Not okay! \n\nIncident two: Just recently (last Thursday to be precise), I placed a takeout order on the phone with my mom who is Salvadore\u00f1a and pronounced all the Spanish words as they should be.. Not only did the woman who answer the phone hang up on my mother, she did not verify the order, gave us attitude for calling back to make sure the total & did nothing to try to slanderer our question. We wanted a cheese quesadilla with sour cream and guac but she placed an order but it was SEVENTEEN DOLLARS!!! I got so mad at her condescending tone to my mother that I demanded to ask her why the online website price is more than 12$ cheaper. \nShe then claimed I was wrong and looking at the wrong menu. I told her it was 4.75 for the quesadilla before tax & then told her the total that was including our additional 0.50 toppings, 2.50 rice side order, and tax as well. Instead of checking the menu to see the other options for quesadilla, or asking us more questions, she just HUNG UP ON ME!!! \n\nOnce I arrived, I asked about my order and it was nowhere to be found. \nThe nicest wait staff in that whole taco shop was this young Asian American lady who fixed my order, paid attention to our table, and tried to make up for the TERRIBLE & RUDE employees. Turns out, not only did they not put my name down properly but they made a POLLO QUESADILLA not their \"poco quesadilla\". Had she checked the prices, she would have seen I wanted the 4.75 quesadilla and not their 9.50 chicken quesadilla. \n\n and the server who took my order argued with me instead of fixing her mistake and kept pronouncing pollo as \"polo\". You work in a taco shop... even if you don't know much Spanish, you should educate yourself on the menu of your restaurant/bar... \nit's very offensive to those of us who identify as Latinxs and speak Spanish. Not to mention disrespectful too. \n\nThis Asian American waitress was able to tell that we were being ignored since her coworkers took orders of the people next to us and couldn't even bother to turn his head to see that I was raising my hand. \nI appreciated her constantly trying but felt frustrated because she kept apologizing for something that's not her fault! \n\nIncident three: let's just say this place may also need a new manager because the manager Max cussed out someone I know. They were just expressing the inattentive and rude server and they were met with a hostile manager. NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. \n\n\nThat's it. Never going back again. This place lost future business with me AND MY FRIENDS.", "author": "Emi N."}

However, some tables sat for 15-30 minutes before being filled. Not sure what the logic behind that was.\n\nAnyway, baja tacos are DELICIOUS, definitely get it Nick's Way. Actually, get anything Nick's Way. Nick is a bloody food genius. Chips and nachos are amazing as well. The meat in the carnitas taco was dry though, I'd recommend just sticking to fish or carne asada instead.\n\nThe drink menu is extensive--they have a variety of beers on tap along with a huge supply of other hard liquor (someone say tequila?) Their cocktails could use some work though. My friends' Tequila Sunset and Lemon Drop tasted off compared to what we usually drink. Couldn't quite pinpoint what was wrong with the Tequila Sunset, but the Lemon Drop had WAY too much Sweet and Sour. Granted, the place was pretty packed, so I can see how mistakes can occur.\n\nNot sure if it was because they were so busy because or the game or not, but it felt as if they were understaffed due to the slight lack of service. The workers were friendly when we did receive service, but execution was a bit lacking. Even at the end of the night when we received our bill, we waited for a good while before having to hunt down a waiter ourselves in order to pay.\n\nTldr;; Great food and drinks, long wait.

This is a great place to meet up with friends, grab a few drinks and catch up over some amazing/affordable/high-quality grub. There are picnic tables in the back for group seating and small bar tables and bar-top seating out front. You can't go wrong with Nick's Crispy Fish Tacos, a side of chips/salsa and guac, and their rich, but worth it, elotes. I also recently tried their agua frescas since I didn't want to drink alcohol, and thought it was very refreshing. It can get crowded here at times with a lot of lurkers trying to get your picnic table, but the staff isn't too pushy to get you out. My last visit here, I met up with old friends from college and they let us get separate checks. I really appreciated this since I was traveling for work and needed to handle my reimbursement. For those of you with a little Steph Curry in you, there's also a basketball game in the back. Happy to report I always crush my competition, but that's probably because my husband is better at shooting a real basketball and I do better off in the Chuck-E-Cheese league. If I needed to state one gripe about this place, it would be the lack of Golden State Warriors representation.

There is not much table seating so if you see a spot when you walk in take it!! Especially on a game day. The service is alright but inconsistent when it gets busy.

Yet it was on the bill at the end of the night. At least the food was as delicious as always. \n\nThen the real comedy started. The bartender (looked to be bar manager maybe?) got in a fight with one of the girls working there. He yelled at her before smashing one of the bar stations. Yes, you read that correctly. He smashed a bar station with his fists right in front of where we were sitting. They then continued yelling at each other outside. Twice. Once wasn't even enough to embarrass themselves enough or to apologize for making a scene. \n\nNo one working there even acknowledged what happened. A cop even came in after someone called about a disturbance outside. Yet they continues to \"work\". Everyone sitting around me was floored, and a few groups asked for their checks and immediately left. We were too stupid to do that. \n\nMeanwhile, the other employees didn't do anything. Our drinks sat empty. We watched multiple employees pour themselves drinks while ours sat empty. I was again given something I didn't order (also on the bill) when they finally did come over. \n\nThey also played the same song on the sound system 5 times super loudly. The margaritas were weak.

This is easily one of my favorite 3 joints in the city, and I'm here at least once a week for better or worse.  They have you covered for yummy Mexican food, with pretty late kitchen hours for SF, a wide range of drinks, and a chill Sunset vibe.  I'm from San Diego, so I slightly favor the style of food they serve here, which is a little more fried and a little more fusion-y, over that in the Mission.\n\nI usually order one of two different things -- a couple of Nick's way Baja fish tacos, or the Cheeseburger burrito.  \n\nThe fish tacos are my favorite.  You get a decently sized cut of fish, battered and fried to perfection, inside a crisply fried tortilla wrapped by a soft tortilla.  Add to that a generous helping of delicious guacamole and their house \"orange\" salsa, and you have a winner.  Comes with a sprig of cilantro and slice of lime.\n\nThe Cheeseburger burrito is a funny invention that sounds odd, but it's very delicious.  Seasoned ground beef inside, with french fries, and some cheese and pickled jalapenos to round out the cheeseburger aspect.  Also some pico de gallo.  That creation is YUMMY, I usually only eat half of it and have the other half as a nice lunch the next day.\n\nOne other thing you should try is the Elote con Queso, aka corn on the cob with butter, cotija cheese, lime, and chili.  Yum.  I'd get it more often if I weren't so full from the other stuff.\n\nDrinks wise, they have a full bar, ranging from the welliest of the wells up to a pretty good top shelf.  They have a good house margarita and a decent sangria, and plus a range of draft beer including macro and craft brews.  Being that I'm usually here to eat, I like to keep it simple and get their Northern Special, which is a shot of Four Roses Bourbon paired with a Bud (yes, a Budweiser, don't judge) for $7.  They also have a Southern Special, which is a shot of tequila paired with a Tecate.\n\nI love the crowd here, people from all walks of life show up, usually to watch a sporting event on one of their many TVs.  The staff is very friendly; it's understandably harder to get an order in if the place is packed for a Giants game, so if you like prompt service you probably want to go on an off night.\n\nSolid neighborhood bar that's also a destination in itself.

Strange.\n\nSo come in with a few bucks, your mad aggressive ordering techniques and game face ready for a good time.\n\nNotables:\n\n- The tacos are good. \n- They have daily HH with $2 tacos and $2 tacates from 4:30-6 (Tuesdays 4:30-close... but come early because it gets packed)\n- Fridays they have awesome dollar margaritas from 5:00-6:00. It. Is. A. must.\n- They play bay area sports above all, which i applaud. \n\nThe staff is nice but you definitely have to be more aggressive, which isn't my style per say, but whatever,", "author": "Ryan L."}

Keep circling the area, and eventually you'll be able to find a spot. Thats one of the downside. Another downside is that they are pretty stingy with their sauce when I order to go though. They only gave me 2 containers when i ordered two burritos. When I saw it, I was just thinking in my mind, are you serious? I noticed other people had to ask for more as well when they ordered to go. Therefore, I do recommend you eat at the restaurant then you can use as much sauce as you want. Otherwise, everything else is on point!", "author": "Cindy D."}

The spot is totally dedicated to Bay Area sports and, oddly enough, it also attracts Michigan and Chicago faithful as well.\n\nNow, about the food...very good \"Americanized\" Mexican fare.   The popular fish tacos are legit, especially the Nick's style.  They were absolutely delicious, so no disappointment there.  The  quesadilla was HUGE and had tender and perfectly seasoned carnita with warm, tasty melted cheese.  The tortilla was crispy and flaky.  Very enjoyable.  Don't forget the sauces too.  They add an extra kick.  \n\nOn the down side, I was not too crazy about the steak nachos.  I thought it lacked punch and got a little too soggy and watery after a while, likely due to the enormous amount of pico de gallo.  I also thought that the guac and pico de gallo need work.  I thought they were fairly bland.  They slathered such a liberal amount that it actually almost muted out the lively  flavor of the food.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the food, delicious despite a few kinks.  Before I forget, let me emphasize...their bartenders are AWESOME...fast, friendly, attentive.  Special props to our bt Jaimie, who kept things fun and flowin through a stressful day.  The extra friendly bartenders and the lively vibe add to the great experience.  This is a cool spot.", "author": "Angel S."}

We would always leave with a great story to tell friends about the terrible service at The Taco Shop:  \"Today, the waitress didn't even look at us as she served us our food.  Seriously, she just set it down, looked the other way and grunted as she shoved it in our direction.  It was absurd!  hilarious!\" \n\nThen it turned into:  \"Should we dine and dash?\" We jokingly considered this many times because it takes 20+ minutes to get the check once we finish our food, and it's clear none of the servers would notice or care if we just left.  (We of course never have, and for some strange puritanical reason, we still tip.)\n\nSo we started getting food to go.  But do not (do not!) bring in coffee from down the street. Today I did just that. I grabbed a coffee at Starbucks, then decided, \"Hey, how about a breakfast burrito!  I'll get it to go since the service is so terrible.\"  I was greeted with \"You can't bring Starbucks in here!\" I just wanted to give them money to make me a burrito that I could eat at home, in peace.\n\nWe tried really hard to stick with this place, but the bad service is no longer entertaining; it's just offensive and confusing.", "author": "Sarah P."}

After two pitchers of margaritas split between three people, we were all on a great drunken level.\n\nLastly, the service was excellent! Our server, Brittany (sorry if I spelled your name wrong), was really friendly and helpful and humored us despite how dumb we must have been acting. She even took the time to pour the leftover margarita in the pitcher into our glasses before taking the pitcher away. I definitely haven't had a server do that for me before :) \n\nOverall, I would definitely return to the Taco Shop and I recommend this place to anyone. \n\nPS GO KINGS GO!!!", "author": "Mark B."}

Didn't order any drinks or other food.  The tacos come folded nicely in a paper holder so it's easy to eat and also pretty sanitary.  The sauces they use in combination with the freshly fried battered fish made for a delicious combination.  The order was sufficient for us to feel satisfied and the surprising variety of textures in the taco was pleasant.  The warm soft tortilla, the light but crisp breading, the tasty fish, crisp but finely chopped cabbage and red onions, all contributed to a memorable meal.  These are the best tacos I've had in a while.  The guacamole was good, and the chips were standard; both were generously portioned.

When I asked for more salsa, the server blankly said, \"which one?\"  And he only gave me one more salsa.  Man, that's some bull excrement; although their salsa's pretty middling and the burritos are just bursting with salsa, so I kind of understand.\n\nTo add insult to injury, after the 5-minute drive home, the bag breaks because two of the burritos, the mahi mahi and the vegetariano, are so full of salsa they are leaking like a super-wet sponge.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-09", "description": "I've been compelled to taco bout' this bar that's reminiscent of a New Orleans shotgun house.  Why's it called a shotgun house you ask?  Instant history lesson: You, fellow Yelper, can open fire from the front door and it will make it's way through each room to the back door.  Shotgun houses are a Feng Shui enthusiast's nightmare.  I diverge, back to this review. \n\nInterior: A narrow hallway separates the bar from tables that line the wall.  The pro in that consists of simply being able to snatch up extra napkins and their bottled version of carafes for water.  Sports flags hang from the ceiling and a few TV's line the length of the bar.  Big ups for the basketball game in the back by some picnic table seating.  Typical, nothing to write home about.  A sports bar-esque establishment in the Sunset deserves a chance to surprise me and become my watering hole.  \n\nFood: The BF and I split chicken nachos.  Just going to say that I'd rather risk the hot sloppy's from everyone's favorite 3am fourth meal destination.  I say this because I'm not a fan of shredded chicken, especially when it's drenched in whatever red sauce that was completely devoid of any Mexican seasonings.  It's also safe to note that I'm not a crock pot concoction aficionado.  The stuff triggers thoughts of soft food that's easy on dentures.  I'm neither a teething infant or a toothless geriatric, so I'll pass on the chicken anything at Underdog's.  You know, it's difficult to settle for non-authentic Mexican in California, in general.  Anyways, word on the streets is that they have Taco Tuesdays here with drink specials.  But I'm a good Samaritan, so make your way to Blue Light on Union in the Marina for better food and drink specials on Taco Tuesday.  De nada. \n\nService: Was there.  No silverware for sloppy nachos nor a refill on our water carafe.  The server was present. \n\nUnderdog's again?  No bueno.  Gonna trek to San Jose for my taco fix from now on.  \n\nYea, this review is boring.  My BF noted that Yelpers either have too many good reviews or too many bad reviews.  This is my attempt at meeting somewhere in the middle.  Proof positive that mediocre places don't deserve reviews because there's obviously NOTHING substantial to say.  Take this review as my sincerest attempt at describing an erroneous place we visited next door to the closed KFC.  Oh yea, that's why we ended up there. Lates.", "author": "Angie N."}

The bar tenders were awesome and I think all of three of them asked us if we were ready to order and some point or another. \n\nWe got a round of margaritas and they were delicious! Definitely strong and well worth it.  I ended up getting one Nick's style carne asada taco and one street style pollo taco. Only the street tacos are included for taco Tuesday. My boyfriend got 2 carne asada tacos, one pollo, and one carnitas, all street style. I think I was so annoying because I kept saying \"this taco is SO good!\" like ten times. Not exaggerating either. That Nick's Way carne asada taco was absolutely amazing!! They pack on the guacamole and have both a hard shell and soft shell in the taco. The red and green salsas they have are really flavorful and we put them on all of our tacos.\n\nI am obsessed and will now be a regular here. We got another round of margaritas to complete our taco Tuesday. By the time we left, people were hovering us for seats at the bar. So I recommend getting there before 6 and take full advantage of happy hour and taco Tuesday.  We got five street tacos, four margaritas, and one nicks way taco and the bill was only $32.

It's got good sangria and great baja style fish tacos.\n\nNow I should be clear:  if it's sweet, tastes kind of like juice, has a hint of alcohol to it, some fresh fruit added, and gives you a bit of a buzz, then by my mark that's good sangria.  I have some friends who always complain to me that the sangria I enjoy is not good sangria.  If you feel that sangria should contain a $40 bottle of Merlot from Gundlach Bundschu in Sonoma then we may not only disagree about what good sangria is, but about the concept of sangria itself.  If you feel that the sangria I have described above, with the fruits and the sweetness, is what you are after, then my god dear reader go nowhere else.\n\nAnd back to the fish tacos.  They come with some awesome fried fish that is crispy and delicious.  Below that is cabbage, and it's wrapped in a delicious corn tortilla.  On top of that they have decent salsas that are contained within plastic squeeze bottles.  I really love their chips with fresh tomato salsa and cilantro.\n\nSo it's a sports bar and I love it.  File it under guilty pleasures.  It's fun to come here at night on a day there's no sports because then I get the place and the killer cheap food to myself.", "author": "Alex H."}

It definitely was filling up by 1 PM for the second group, which was fine. They had all the games on and the TVs were good enough.\n\nThe bloody mary (which, as far as I could tell, is not on the menu for some reason) was GREAT! Nicely spicy and really flavorful, with good accompaniments of celery, a big olive, and lime and lemon slices. The burrito was not as great, especially because the tortilla seemed in no way heated. It seems like a good idea to stick to the tacos.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Unfortunately, the only thing that filled us was frustration up to our throats. Let me count the ways... \n\n1. Lack of organization - With 5 people at our table, they managed to mix up my friend's order of a chicken San Diego burrito (she received beef instead) and serve our two other friends' meals to the wrong customers. Fortunately, they made corrections to our bill and apologized for their honest mistakes. Their ordering/ticketing system could use steep improvement!\n\n2. Underwhelming food - The San Diego carne asada burrito had a paltry amount of meat compared to the countless burritos served in SD. It was more like a sandwich than a burrito. The guacamole sat on top of a spoonful of over-salted steak, and at the bottom was a pool of thick red sauce that oozed out of the tortilla into a messy pile. Thankfully, they had napkins at the table. Overall, the food was only passable as a late night snack to hold over a famished person with low standards. Call me a burrito snob, but I have higher expectations at a 4-star-Yelp-rated restaurant.\n\n3. Terrible service - A sandy blonde waitress wearing thigh-baring black shorts and fishnet stockings (talk about professional attire) took our orders and was blatantly inattentive after she realized two guys at our table had opened tabs at the bar. She informed us that the picnic table where we were seated was for \"dinner service only.\" Apparently, five people ordering food from the dinner menu wasn't enough to qualify us for \"dinner service.\" Then she proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the evening. After closing their tabs at the bar, my friends were hoping to order more drinks at our table. The waitress stood staring at her cash register for next 20-30 minutes, snubbing customers, completely oblivious to our attempts to flag her down. She even walked over to clear the table next to us and deliberately disregarded our polite requests for water and our questions about the bill. Maybe she was sight/hearing impaired, having a bad day, or just plain rude. We will never know, because we're not coming back here again (sober)...", "author": "Tina C."}

A little confusing at first because it's a \"sit anywhere you like\" type of establishment but around 1 on a Saturday we found the end of large picnic table to share with a pair of strangers.\nExtra $1.50 for chips and salsa but SO worth it. Fresh and warm chips and salsa full of flavor. I just wish they put the salsa on the side-the chips on the bottom got soggy and I hate wet food :(\nMy boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos and I got the veggie burrito.

Not wanting to have to buy both beers and building my own, I opted for just the cider.  As expected, it was as good as you would expect, a feat that the bar itself had nothing to do with.  While we didn't order any food, we were served some warm chips and salsa with our beers.  I liked that the chips were warm, but didn't like that the waitress had dumped the salsa on top of the chips and making them soggy to eat.\n\nAs a place to kick back and enjoy a beer, Underdog's is pretty good.

I thought the food was delicious. I ordered a Shrimp Taco done Nick's Way and Elote and it was so good. Oddly, the corn kind of outshone the rest of the food my friend's and I had ordered, but, then again, how good is corn smothered in butter and cheese, ammiright? The salad and burrito that my friends got looked good, but I still think it's all about their tacos and elote.\n\nThe atmosphere is cute and kind of funny (like a sports bar crashed into a Mexican restaurant) and they have a couple of games that were fun to watch other people play. (people were seriously good at the basketball one)\n\nthe minus star comes from the service. It was pretty fast, but the girl didn't talk to us even when we ordered. She just looked at us until we spoke, didn't greet us at all, and, frankly, just looked super bored and disinterested.

In short, the service was god awful.\n- The bar wasn't terribly busy and we were able to be seated pretty quickly. Things started off well because a guy who was previously at our table started bussing it (he didn't introduce himself but it appeared that he worked there and had a vested interest in making sure we were happy -- maybe a manager?)\n- Our orders were taken quickly and efficiently. No complaints there.\n- Our drinks arrived in short order.\n- 4 out of 5 of our orders arrived without any fuss.\n\nThis is when the annoyances began.\n- 5 minutes went by and my order (a straight up Baja Fish Taco Nicks way -- no customizations) didn't arrive.\n- After 10 minutes, I had to flag down someone and ask about my taco. There was no apology about missing the order; the waitress just went over and \"checked up\" on our order.\n- Since we were in the back, I could see the kitchen's output counter. Five minutes later, my taco showed up. \n- NONE of the waitstaff bothered to check the kitchen counter while food piled up; after the kitchen rang their \"ready\" bell TWICE, I had enough and went to get my own taco. I specifically recall their being 3-4 meals stacked up besides my own.\n- In the meantime, noone bothered to refill our water or generally check up on us.\n\n- Now, I could forgive all of this for wait staff having a bad day but the next issue merited this review. A second waitress came up and introduced herself as our replacement waitress. Smooth move on their part as we had no reason to be annoyed with this second waitress. \n\nWhen we got the bill, they had automatically put an 18% tip -- even though their menu clearly stated that was only for parties of 6 or more (we had 5 ppl).\n\nThat's total BS.\n\nI complained that this wasn't right and they changed my bill without further comment. We still left a tip (but certainly not 18%). \n\nJust in case you think we were just being \"difficult customers\": on the way out I had a chat with two guys who had stepped out of the bar for a smoke after they had finished a drink. They too were experiencing really shoddy service that day and claimed to have waited 40 min for their tacos.\n\nLesson Learned: sit at the bar. From previous visits, the bartenders have always been friendly and its harder to ignore you when you are right there in their face.\n\nBottom Line: The tacos are always great and the kitchen staff was apologetic.

Besides the bar, there are few tables lined up along the side, and a couple larger tables in the back.  I personally have never had too much trouble finding seats, but on a really crowded night I could see it being a bit of an issue.\n\nAs for food, their chips and salsa are super good. I'm huge fan of pico de gallo, so I order the chips & salsa every time I come here.  My go-to meal at the Taco Shop is the Fish Tacos - Nick's Way.  The fish tacos are great! The fish is fresh, lots of salsa and lime, and I can't forget that good guacamole! I recommend those tacos to any friend I take here.  Along with that, I have tired their carne asada street tacos, and those were pretty on point as well.\n\nFor alcohol, I felt that the prices were pretty decent.  My friends and I usually get a pitcher of whatever is on tap, which works out the best for us.  I have been here only once for happy hour, but from what I remember they had a good deal on margaritas (and I think $2 tacos as well), so I will definitely be trying that out next time!", "author": "Megan K."}

So, there was bad traffic with the Bay Bridge closure so I decided to kill some time and check out this joint as it's close to the commute line.\n\nChecked out the carnitas taco, Nick's style - I think Nick is my new favorite person......the carnitas was crispy and creamy, so much flavor.  The taco alone was stellar, not a new concept of putting a fried tortilla with a warm flour toritlla, but they make it awesome here.  Loads of guac in that taco as well. \n\nThen followed that up with a carnitas burrito, California style.  New thing to have fries in your burrito, but I've had many cuban burritos in the past with potatoes in them, so...why not?  Still unclear why fries make a burrito \"California\", but......it rocked!  Again, the carnitas was ridiculously good and the fries stayed crispy.  Could have used a bit of a kick inside, but the flavors were sooooo good all around.  \n\nThe side sauces in the bottles on the bar were both flavor packed and well balanced.  I think I went through at least a quarter bottle between the two.    \n\nI rolled out (literally) with a huge smile.  This place totally lived up to the hype.\n\nThank you Nick and staff.

I have came here for the 2nd time and it was just as good as I remember. I got the carne asada nicks way taco and the shrimp nicks way taco. The smoky like chipotle sauce they have on the table goes fantastic with these. Its about 5 bucks a taco which at first you might be like \"what?!\" but when you get your food, you'll realize the price is pretty reasonable for the size taco you get. Everything is fresh and the staff is friendly and able to handle the crowded and busy environment as well. The only thing I don't like about this place is that you have to wait since it's always crowded no matter what day you come. But the wait is very well worth it! Wish this place was bigger lol. You have to sit literally at the same table and next to people but they don't bite so who cares? The food came out super quick which I was happy about. They also have a full bar and have little old school games on some of the front tables which is kinda dope. \nEntertaining restaurant overall. You just have to check this place out.

The margaritas are STRONG, especially for the price ($28 for a big pitcher and my boyfriend and I were both sauced at the end...bravo, guys). But mostly those tacos. They took forever to come out but once they did they were well worth the wait. \n\nI will say that the organization at this place is non-existent. We walked in around 2 on a Saturday and it was packed but we couldn't find a host/hostess. There's no sign indicating the apparent sign-up-with-a-server system and everybody was dashing around haphazardly so I didn't want to bug them. We managed to snag a table without getting yelled at, though, so maybe nobody else was on the waiting list. They forgot our order of chips/salsa/guac, which was disappointing since we'd been walking around for 4 hours and were starving and looking forward to an appetizer. But when they did bring it out (with the rest of the food, after being reminded) it was huge. \n\nNormally I don't give good reviews for places that have mediocre service and are this disorganized, but the food, margaritas, and reasonable prices won me over. I'd go back for sure.", "author": "Dani W."}

(btw I wanna come back during these deals). \n\nMy two taco choices were the \"Carne Asada Taco\" & the \"Pescado 'Baja' Style Taco\". So satisfied with what I ordered!!!! The tacos were so CRISPY and BIG!! They put a scoop-like amount of guacamole on my tacos and I absolutely love avocados. My carne asada was cooked to perfection and complemented so well with the crispness of the taco. The beer battered fish was really fresh. I like the fact that the  tacos come with a crispy tostada like shell and the corn flour tortilla.

Ever. \n\nAfter using Yelp for to decide where to eat practically every time I eat out, I have decided it's time to contribute. And I KNEW that The Taco Shop at Underdog's HAD to be the first place I reviewed. It would be wrong of me not to, considering how many times I've returned here.\n\nLet me start off by saying that this place is AMAZING. That's not only referring to the food, but to the service and atmosphere too. It's a sports bar, with some arcade games lining the walls, and if you're a Giant's fan (who in SF isn't?), you'll definitely find yourself a home here. The wait staff and bartenders are super friendly, and the owner Nick is awesome too!\n\nYou MUST get the tacos here \"Nick's Way.\" It comes served in a crispy taco on the inside, and a soft tortilla on the outside. And LOTS of delicious guac! The carne asada and pescado tacos are both tasty, and since I can never decided which of the two to get, I just let myself be greedy and order one of each.\n\nAnd can I please just give a special shout out to that red sauce they serve?? It is seriously what dreams are made of! I would take a bottle of that stuff home with me and smother all my food with it if I could.\n\nThe carne asada quesadilla here is also top notch! They are MASSIVE, and they definitely do not skimp on the meat or the cheese. (On the downside, one time they did serve me my quesadilla a litlte bit burnt, and me being the timid little girl I am, I didn't ask for a new one.... but it was still yummy and didn't stop me from consuming the entire thing.)\n\nChips and salsa +/- guacamole? YES PLEASE. The tortilla chips are delicious, and they pile on the salsa and guacamole. And even if you somehow run out of the salsa, that red sauce is sitting right next to you and waiting to devoured.\n\nMy one gripe with the place? Taco Tuesdays here are just okay. You only get a deal on the street tacos ($1) and PBRs ($2), but Nick's way tacos are still regularly priced (~$6). But it's not enough to take away my 5-star rating.\n\nIt gets crowded, and seating can be a bit of a challenge, but it's definitely worth the wait. Parking around the area can be a bit of a pain as well, but it's not as bad as other parts of the city. \n\nAlso, as a side note, Nick's Crispy Tacos off of Broadway also offers tacos \"Nick's Way\", but in my opinion, this location is MUCH better. Come here instead.\n\nWhen I used to live in SF and first tried this place, I was instantly HOOKED. I used to come here at least once, if not twice, a week (I know, a bit much), and I would introduce anyone and everyone I knew to this little piece of heaven. Go here.

I love Mexican food any day of the week but having it on Taco Tuesday is especially fun here in SF due to the multitude of restaurants & bars participating in drink & taco specials. \n\nLike many of their Taco Tueday rivals, The Taco Shop @ Underdogs is busy, but it's not the clusterfuck that those other places are. No stool at their extra long bar was available & the picnic tables in the back were full but we were able to grab the last open Pac Man \"table.\" Awesome touch & good use of space.\n\nThe Foods:\n- baja style fish taco (nick's way): good batter on the fish. Served in a crunchy taco *AND* a soft tortilla & topped with a hefty dose of guac. \n- carne asada California burrito: so disappointing. the french fries were more like just regular potatoes b/c they were not crispy & carne asada was chewy & not well seasoned. I don't recommend it at all. \n- $1 street taco: carnitas, carne asada & chicken: did not try, but looked smallish\n- shrimp taco: did not try but my lovely companion said it was mostly slaw & the shrimp were super tiny. \n- strawberry agua fresca: thick, not that sweet, a real winner.\n- chips & salsa:  addictive. we ordered 2 baskets at $1.50 each, so worth it. Thick cut chips & fresh pico de gallo.\n- guacamole: they are generous with the portions but it is nothing special (no heat, no kick.) \n\nFor under $30, we ate well. The waitresses checked to made sure our order was taken & was attentive to us throughout the meal. I would definitely come back for that huge fish taco & their chips & salsa. As for a good California burrito (burrito w/ fries inside), I guess I'll have to head south for that.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I watched three times as empty tables cleared big enough for all of us and other customers were given priority even though we had been there longer and had been first on the list.

Fish tacos was fried perfectly and had a nice crispy wet type batter that just melted in your mouth.  The fish was noticeably fresh.  This fish taco would rival that of any fish taco in Baja.  As for the carnitas it was delicious as well.  I wish it had a little bit more texture from having it fried on a flatop after the initial braise.  Aside from that small critique the seasoning was nuanced with the proper hint of marjoram and cilantro in the meat.  \n\nSalsa and guacamole that adorned the tacos had a vibrant taste only found when it's newly and freshly made.  This place doesn't skim on the quality of ingredients.  \n\nGood to hear that they source the meats from small local farms and the animals are naturally raised and not from factory based farms.", "author": "Stephen V."}

I fell in love with Nick's crispy tacos a few years ago when I first had the pescado tacos at their original location in Nob Hill. I was so excited when I heard that Nick would be serving his tacos in my hood! \n\nAnyway, what I've learned from my girls at work is to always call in your order cause lunch time should be spent reading magazines in the office--and not spent waiting for our food to be made, no siree. So, always call ahead. Whenever I call from work for pick up, the food is usually ready in 15-20 minutes. \n\nThe last time I was there, my friend and I wanted to dine-in instead, but the bar was so packed cause there was a Giants' game. So, what did we do? We walked over to the Starbucks around the corner and phoned in our order, haha. Trust me, if you had seen the crowd at Underdog's that evening, you would've done the same. Since I always get the fish tacos, I opted for the carnitas this time, and they were just as good. My friend says their carne asada tacos are good, too. We always get some chips & salsa to go with our meal. I've never had chips like these before; they're super crispy. I have a love-hate relationship with them. It really just depends on my mood, LOL.

My mouth was ravished by the great taste it had to offer ;). Nick's way is the way the go! It's crunchy but not too crunchy and tastes SO good. I find myself in a pickle because I'm trying to review this put I'm all giggly trying to remember the tasty experience.\n\nIt looks like a small place from the outside, but it's quite the opposite inside. However, despite the size of this place, you really need to go early or plan your dates. I went down there on a Giants game night and it was packed, no room to sit and barely any room to walk! Being unable to grab a seat, we ordered the tacos to go and it took about 20 minutes to have six tacos done. (Having it done Nick's way costs about 6 dollars a taco, but I believe it's less if you order a regular taco)\n\nWe could have stuck around to watch the game, but I'm not interested in baseball so we took a stroll around to check out the restaurants around. 20 minutes passed quickly after talking about cars, so we went back to grab the grub but unfortunately had to eat in the car. It finally came down to the tacos... It came down to unwrapping it, and it looked AMAZING.. These guys weren't stingy either, for six bucks you definitely get your worth in fish and in great taste! And if you think the tacos were something, even their CHIPS were great! Fresh, warm, and crunchy it went so well with the red sauce they had in the bag.\n\nAfter two of the tacos, I was like \"THE BEST, SO FRIGGIN GOOD OMG\" and it almost felt like eating this was all a dream. I swear, I would probably drop $50 dollars here easily eating their tacos. These tacos definitely would have gone down great with some beer, but since the universe looks down upon me I could not get any.. beer that is. :(\n\nThis place DEFINITELY deserves five stars, but it gets four because I can't enjoy a drink there while eating my tacos YET.

The taco is made of crispy fried fish wrapped in a crispy taco shell, then wrapped in a soft corn tortilla.  It's topped with cabbage and the best part of the entire meal: their Hass avocado guacamole.\n\nThe guac is the best I've had!  The creamy Hass avocados are mixed to the perfect texture - a little bit chunky, so you can still feel like you're eating the world's best veggie, but augmented by other spices and flavors.  If you're craving guacamole alone, you can order the appetizer size.  The price, $5, is a bit steep, but the guac is well worth it.  Hass avocados aren't cheap, after all.\n\nLuckily, the guac comes with many of their other popular dishes, such as their nachos, some of the many available burritos, and the previously mentioned tacos Nick's Way.  While the famous Pescado taco Nick's Way is pretty expensive at $5.25, it's a fairly large portion.  I only need one to fill me up (plus some of the chips & guac), and many guys I know only eat 2.  When you consider the fresh, delicious ingredients used to craft such a fantastic meal, the price is worth it.\n\nIn addition to the food, Underdogs is also a sports bar, serving draft & bottled beers, sangria, and delicious margaritas.  Friday nights from 6-6:30pm is the $1 margarita special; I'm told it's absolutely packed!  They also have Taco Tuesdays, but unfortunately, only the street tacos (devoid of the guac) are discounted to $1 each.  Still, a great deal.  They have lots of TVs, and during my most recent visit, the Laker game was on one TV and the Giants game on another across the room...ensuring that my boyfriend could watch the Lakers and my friends on the other side of the table could watch the Giants.\n\nWhenever I've been there, we've managed to find a table, but if it gets really packed, it can require some hovering over tables that look like they're nearing the end of their meal.  The staff won't let you order unless you are seated, but you can also take your food to-go, if you have to.  Try to find seats though, because the service is usually really good, even when it's packed.\n\nJust writing this review makes me crave a Pescado taco, Nick's Way, so I will definitely be heading over there again soon!", "author": "Caroline K."}

I went to school in San Diego so I'm constantly on the hunt for these. The french fry is different than what you would find in SD, in that it's the kind that is double battered, fried and more seasoned. No complaints about that!\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what is in their bottles of hot sauce/salsa but both the roasted tomato and green tomatillo sauces are delicious!

You get 3 street tacos, chips and a choice of drink (soda or agua fresca).  It took a really long time to get my food (street tacos shouldn't take that long?) even though hardly anyone was there at the time (it was still early).  \n\nEach tacos features two soft small corn tortillas covered with meat, sprinkled liberally with fresh cilantro and chopped onions.  I don't think you get to choose the type of meat.\n\n* Chicken taco: skinless, didn't seem grilled, somewhat dry with not that much flavor, skip\n* Carnitas taco: Just okay, also lacking in flavor other than the flavor of salt, dry\n* Carne asada taco: Best tasting, most flavorful, least dry, chopped into small bits\n* Chips: homemade, thick, extra crunchy, oily, barely received any - maybe a handful\n* Salsa: best part of the lunch special, they include three kinds, all of them were excellent especially the spicy green tomatillo one.  They are seasoned just right, full flavored, fresh and zesty.  The next best one was the smoky chipotle.\n\nEven though some of the meat was dry and not that tasty, the salsas make up for the meat.  I also read that the ingredients are sourced from local farms when possible so that's a plus.  Happy hour is 4:30 - 6 PM, M-F, and during that time you can enjoy $1 street tacos.  As for ambiance, it's a sports bar and it looks like every inch is covered with some sports flag or sign.  My favorite part of the decor is the picture of \"Underdog\".

Specifically, the woman who works (manages?) there on Sunday mornings.   Her attitude is somewhere between \"perpetually annoyed\" and \"you're so lucky I'm helping you\" and it makes you feel unwelcomed and burdensome.

The wait staff came by our table very frequently to check and see if we wanted more beer, tacos, etc. It was great to not have to get up and navigate through a bunch of crowds to try to place my order at the bar. \n\nThere were also several fun games to play- street fighter, pac-man, basketball hoops - all great!\n\nPros: \n\n- Has something for everyone! You can come here with a big group of people and everyone will find something they enjoy (beer, tacos, games!)\n- Really good service. The wait staff was very quick and kept our table super clean \n\nCons\n- Probably not the best place to go if you want to have a long conversation with your friends - it does get a bit loud.

A full service sports bar with a number of huge flat screen TVs. Plenty of table seating inside and also at the bar counter. \n\nTheir menu featured Starters, Tacos, Quesadillas, Burritos and Drinks. They also serve up breakfast during football season only, which I found interesting. \n\nWe decided to start off with an appetizer and got the 'Nachos es muy Grande' - Pinto Beans, Monterey Jack Cheese, Pico De Gallo, Jalape\u00f1os, Guacamole, Mexican Sour Cream served with your choice of Steak or Chicken. But we opted for a no meat version. \n\nMy colleagues both ordered Burritos and I got the Mexican \"Street Style\" Tacos - One Carne Asada (steak), one Carnitas (pork) and one Pollo (chicken) Taco with Cilantro and Onions on small Corn Tortillas. \n\nSeveral minutes later the nachos arrived. The plate was piping hot and the portion was nice! The taste, the crisp and thickness of the nachos were perfect along with the medley of gorgeous toppings. The roasted jalapenos along with the green and red salsa took the heat flavors to another level. I'd say it's one of the best nachos I've had in a while! \n\nIt didn't take long until the rest our order hit the table. Out of the three street style tacos, the chicken taco was my favorite - the bomb! It was tasty, juicy and just perfect. However, the pork and the beef taco just didn't do it for me. I asked my colleagues about their burrito experience and got the nodding heads of approval. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed the food and the ambiance.

I didn't catch what they were called exactly, but one had a bit of smokey/roasted pepper flavor and the other was more of a lighter salsa verde maybe. Regardless, both were very tasty. The tacos were not traditional street tacos, but they were very good on their own, but did need the extra splash of flavor from the sauces in my opinion. We tried the nachos as well, which were also really good; however, I didn't love the chips they use. Not sure if they are common out in San Francisco, but the chips mildly reminded me of Fritos, which I do not care for at all. Again, they definitely weren't Fritos, but something about them made me think of Fritos. Besides the food being pretty cool, the bar is nice and big, the seating area is a good size, and though the place was busy we were able to grab a couple stools at the bar as soon as we walked in. They had plenty of bartenders and servers for a bar of its size in my opinion. The only other complaint I had, minor too, is that their beer selection could have been better.", "author": "Kevin C."}

Operative word: try.  (I planned an event on Facebook with some of my friends to specifically come here and try the infamous fish tacos.)  My girlfriend and I arrived here around 7:30 PM on January 7, 2014.  It was my first time, so pardon me if I didn't know the unspoken rules about signing in with a server in order to get a table.  My girlfriend checks in with one of the servers, a female with frizzy hair who was very kind, for a table for four.  As we were waiting, one of the two seaters over a gaming console opened up, so my girlfriend and I sat down there to wait for our larger table and friends.  A man with red pants and a slight mustache comes over and asks if we had signed in, which we told him we did but that we were waiting for a four seater.  He informed us that we couldn't sit in the two person table and needed to sign up on the waiting list.  I totally understand, so we got up to stand around and wait again.  A few minutes later, a table for four does open up and the woman with the frizzy hair takes a look at the waiting list and seats my girlfriend and I.  The man who had originally told us off the two seater comes over and asks us why we were sitting down, to which I informed him that the lady with the frizzy hair had sat us down and that we had followed his instructions to sign up on the waiting list. He then tells me that \"she's wrong then, you can't sit there\" and that someone else was before us.  I told him politely to please check with his frizzy-haired coworker.  He stood over our table without answering me and he kept staring at me which made me feel uncomfortable.  He finally walked over to the frizzy haired woman and after having a brief conversation with her, the man with the red pants gives me a thumbs up and walks over to me asking 'how he could help me' as if this sudden change in attitude would make up for his lack of professionalism.  I told him that I wanted another server, to which he questioned \"Why?\"  I answered, \"Because you have been rude to me the whole night.\"  He informs me that he is the only one working the back section, so I tell him, \"Well then, I'm leaving.\"  I walked out on your establishment, which seems pretty cool other than this man who knows nothing about customer service, while he stood there and looked bewildered of my actions.\n\nInstead of asking his coworker if she had sat me down initially, he already started pointing fingers by saying I didn't belong at the table.  It did not make me feel welcome at all.", "author": "Brandon Y."}

Ordered the grilled fish taco Nick's way, and enjoyed every single bite. Topped it off with a glass of Sangria, which contained various slices of fruit that don't hide the punch in the drink.\n\nThe only complaints I have are that the tacos took an extraordinarily long time to be delivered (20 minutes minimum) and that the chips and salsa are not complimentary (I suppose the latter is standard for a sports bar, but I'm accustomed to restaurants where pre-meal chips are a given). \n\nWill definitely return the next time I am in the area and would recommend it to any taco lover.", "author": "Ashley P."}

And while I was chewing into my food, it didn't taste so fresh and when I think back on it, it didn't look very fresh either when I ordered it and got my food unusually quick. \n\n  So after eating that and finishing my beer, one hour or two goes by, I started feeling very nauseated and sick to my stomach that I felt like yacking. And when 9pm hit, I was yacking like crazy. I yacked so much, that my stomach started hurting while I was yacking. More painful than drinking too much alcohol. I had never been in so much pain in my life from food poisoning.\n\n  After throwing up, I tried eating another home cooked meal, and a few minutes go by, I shower and I had to throw up again in the middle of the shower. And not to mention after trying to sleep, about every 30 minutes I had to throw up throughout the whole night which was at least 8 times. \n\n  Because of this horrible traumatizing food poisoning experience, I will never ever come back to Underdog's even if the owner offers me free food and drinks from now on. Sure the food poisoning could have came from the bad food, an employee not washing his/her hands, dirty beer or dirty glass. but all I know is I got sick as hell from here because I didn't eat anything or anywhere else within the past 11 hours from being here.

I got 3 legit street tacos in LA for 3 bucks and all the fixings on the side.  So much more satisfying.  Also, they made their abuse meat not so shoe-like consistency.  \n\nWork on it Undergod, you'll get it.  But if you folks make enough money on the drinks and don't care about the quality of your food, than more power to you folks.  But that was my first and last time there.", "author": "Shin L."}

I might be super girly, but sports culture is one I like to partake in, and Underdog's is THE haven for sports aficionados. I've been here before during the NBA finals to watch some games and of course it was packed. So warning - this place does get filled FAST, especially during huge sports events. Despite the table dilemma (and the fact that we probably stood for most of the time), I had fun watching the game, handing out high-fives here and there with strangers. So as a bar, Underdog's is perfect! And they have decent deals. \n\nBut then.....there are the tacos. Don't get anything else. Do yourself the favor and just try one. The two taco combo for $8.50 is seriously a bargain because the tacos are FAT. Totally worth the price - you'll barely finish eating the 2nd taco, trust. Get it Nick's Way (is there any other way?). Also try the pescado \"baja\" style. I know carne asada is clutch 80% of the time, but their fish taco is dankkkk. It's battered (but not heavily), and the fish is delicious. Not to mention, TONS of guac, as in they just dump like a cup full onto the taco. And it's a soft taco wrapping a hard shell (think Taco Bell's double decker)! Crazy! You basically get that subtle nice crunch. It's like when I add nachos onto my burrito lol. \n\nOh and don't forget to put some of their creamy hot sauce.

Easy to get a seat at the bar and easy to get service since not many people were here. Ordered the carnitas, carne asada, and pollo tacos with the house margarita. Even though the tacos were small (well for me at least), they were still delicious! Tasted even better after dousing them with the condiments. The tacos were easily gobbled down. Can't imagine the eating experience when there is a Giants game or other game taking place. The house margarita was alright. I am not a big fan of alcohol but decided to try it. I haven't had a good experience with tequila drinks but decided to try a margarita since I haven't had one before. I had salt on the rim and personally I think the salt makes tequila taste way worse than it already does. I had to drink a lot of water with my margarita. During my meal, I used many napkins and I felt bad because the bartender always came by to clean up. Not that I couldn't do it myself it's just I had no where else to put them, the tacos were just so good and messy.

I was here last night to catch Cal thump Maryland in a lopsided season opener 52-13 as local product Javid Best rolled up 137 yards on just 10 carries. Front loaded with bar stools and tables, I was sitting at the end of the bar just right before the stacks of large picnic tables in the back. This sports bar is smallish when compared to others but the groups of people coming in and out to catch the game were persistent and spirited. Contrary to the paradigms experienced at many sports bars where boring burgers and artery clogging finger foods can be shortchanging and one-dimensional, their menu offers a full bar with an array of non-repulsive, quasi-authentic Mexican cuisine that was surprisingly likable and delicious. \n\nMy two grilled mahi tacos, one of which was done \"Nick's Way\", turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The regular taco ($4.50) had a good portion of smoky marinated mahi on top of double corn tortillas smothered with cabbage, cilantro and onions. These tacos were plump and fully stuffed. I thought the mahi was impressive with a smoky taste that complemented well with their green salsa. The Nick's Way ($5.50) had the same baseline ingredients with the addition of fresh guacamole and a fried tortilla to couple with a soft tortilla at the bottom. I'm not sure how the tortilla was fried, but it was nicely seasoned and tasted better than the regular taco. In addition, I thought their complimentary chips were addictive as it was served warm and nicely salted with a thick hearty texture layered with wholesome chunky salsa. My homemade honeydew fresca ($2.50) was sweet and refreshing.  After realizing that their food was actually good, I was no longer surprised at seeing so many people coming in for take outs. \n\nI had a great time overall. However, there were several limitations to the experience. First, they put the TVs on mute so I couldn't hear any commentaries and play by play analysis during the game. Second, aside from my server Sam, who was outstanding and personable, the other servers looked stressed out, unfriendly, and awkward to talk to. Price was high but I'm willing to overlook the limitations in exchange for an excitable menu and friendly environment to add to the experience of watching a game. They also have free wifi so I may have to bring my laptop here to hold my upcoming NFL fantasy draft.

I recently developed a horrible allergic reaction to cheese (tragic because I love cheese) so I didn't eat any further. The server came & I informed her the order was wrong again & she apologized. I had to ask a second server for my check. When I informed the second server about my food order having been completely wrong she got me my original waiter which had been on lunch.  At which point he began to attack me over my ordering wrong. He refused to admit the accident was on their end. At the time I ordered he had repeated my order to me correctly & he had imputed it as baja because the first one (the one with onions) had come out as baja style NOT nicks way, all of which he kept denying.  It would not have been a big deal I wanted nothing off the he bill just an apology since I had to go deal with an allergic reaction thanks to their mistake.

The baja fish taco, (especially Nicks way if you like guac) is outstanding, and the other tacos are consistently delicious. The carnitas is by far the best meat, and i highly recommend trying it in a quesadilla, but avoid the pico de gallo they put in it because itll get soggy. They make their own sauce called baja sauce, which adds a refreshing kick to all the menu items, and both their red and green sauces are a staple on everything  (I even bought some to take home with me).  But you must, MUST, try the elote.  Its corn sprinkled with some form of cheese and spice, and its more addicting than crack. \n\nI recommend avoiding peak times (Tuesdays and Friday afternoons) because it gets crowded and you cant find a seat, and unfortunately they wont serve you food unless you're seated.   Although if you do go during those times, its $2 tecates on tuesdays, and $1 Margaritas from 6-630 on fridays, so you cant go wrong with the deals.

You have to get them Nick's way if you want the best experience. I live in San Diego and I have to say that the tacos here stand up and even surpass a lot of the tacos I can get in my area. I will say that the service can be slow at times, but hey, it's a busy place. I think i'll live if I have to wait a little longer before stuffing my face with delicious Tacos.\n\nNow for something very important to me about a bar; the vibe. There's just something very welcoming and friendly about The Taco Shop. I haven't seen many bars where mixed fans can cheer for their sports teams without fear of retaliation. \n\nThere's a reason why I come to this place pretty much every time I'm in San Francisco, other than the fact that it is around the block from my friend's house. It is a great, casual, bar that offers great value for the money. I will continue to come back for more.", "author": "Ryan F."}

Note also that Nick himself is no longer affiliated with Nick's Tacos but he is with Underdog's and Tortilla Heights (which is a reason to support the latter places IMO). ***\n\nI give Underdog's 4 stars overall - the food I would rate just a bit lower but the quantity to price value is better than Nick's Tacos/Tortilla heights so I bumped the average to 4 stars. \n\nThe Nick's Way carne asada and carnitas at Underdog's are great tacos but I have to give the original Nick's Tacos (2nd) and the more recent Tortilla Heights the edge (3rd) so I rank this 4th best in SF. La Taqueria at 25th/Mission is still #1. I found the carne asada at Underdog's to have a lot more flavor than the carnitas and found it much more enjoyable. [Update: the baja style fish taco at Underdogs is even better than those at Nick's which was lauded for those in the 7x7 piece last year. It had just the right amount of crispiness and is the best taco at Underdogs. I still prefer the carne at Nick's/la Taqueria though!]\n\nAll four places have similar taco formula of one lightly fried corn tortilla inside a soft corn tortilla. Underdogs is the most unique since the inner tortilla is fried more crispy and the outer tortilla is more soft and they give the largest quantity of filling (just above La Taqueria but about 25% more than Nick's IMO). I don't think there is any cheese in the middle but I could be wrong (I only looked when I had 2 bites left).\n\nThe green salsa was good but not great (Tortilla Heights and La Taqueria have the best and TH has more variety). At Underdogs there is a 2 Nick's Way taco special for $8.50 and with the larger size it gives the best value of the 4 places. The chips and pico de gallo are very good ($1.50).\n\nThe sports bar ambiance feels very much like a surf pub in San Diego, with picnic tables and such and it was a cool vibe that took me back to college days in Pacific/Mission Beach or Solana Beach/Del Mar.\n\nAll in all I will go back to Underdog's since it is the closest to where I live and the pub vibe is cool but when I crave the best I will make the trek to La Taqueria or the original Nick's Tacos.", "author": "Mike L."}

After an unfortunate mistake with my first beer, she was quick with a fix and even took care of my first shot of Jame(son), then she goes, \"OMG that's awesome I'll take one with you, my name is Jamie\"!  Then she promptly took care of our order and recommended God's tacos haha.  We all ordered one fish taco and one shrimp taco each (NICKS WAY!!!) based on her recommendation.  And the beers and shots of Jameson flowed for almost three hours as we watched the opening day Giants game.  Being the orange and black faithful that I am, I started chants and riled everyone up numerous times while we watched the game.  We even had a crowd gather around our corner and we became the loudest cheer section! After it was said and done, she said our group rocked and wanted us there for all Giants road games.

Throw in their great salsa's made at the restaurant, and you've got yourself a delicious fiesta o' flavor.\n\nHonestly, friends, there's nothing like it. They use a soft tortilla as the actual \"taco\" part, but they layer it with nacho chips. Utter genius. Then you've got the crunchy cabbage, the crispy fish filet, sour cream, guacamole...simply divine. And don't be scared of the price of one taco NICK'S WAY (about $5.50). These fish tacos are larger than most. \n\nAnd I really dig the atmosphere here. It's more like a sports bar, but I love that. I really do.

It's on their website. Check it out. \n\nOk, now the rant. I really don't watch sports, but when I do, it's cool to do it at a sports bar. I assumed that since Underdog's describes itself as a sports bar, it would work out. So, I took myself and my two Canadian friends to watch the Stanley Cup at Underdog's. The Stanley Cup, while not the most celebrated of things in America, is still a finals event in a professional sport. However, most of the tvs here didn't even have it on. Not only that, but there was some ambient techno being played rather than the game's play. \n\nWe politely tolerated the techno for the first period and a half. In the meantime, we were served by some really surly waitress who made us lift up all of the items on the table to wipe it down and then instead of telling me whether or not they had Miller Lite, made me refer to the menu (which I didn't realize had a beer list) by saying, \"We only serve what's on the menu.\" That's pretty rude I must say. She also was intent on straightening the wrinkled paper menus, which a friend of mine noticed on a separate trip with another server. Is it a requirement of the wait staff to be OCD? \n\nFinally, we admitted defeat and acknowledged that it was just too weird to watch a game with a Brian Eno soundtrack. We asked a waitress (not ours) if the sound could be put on while I asked for water for the second time. She told us she'd ask. Then our waitress walked up, and said no way, that the owner doesn't do that. Doesn't play the sound to games? At a sports bar? Weird! \n\nBut we did finally get our water. After guzzling a few glasses, we moved our party to Kezar. As we traveled, I was really nervous that SF just isn't a hockey town, and maybe Underdog's was a reflection of all SF sports bars. I was so wrong. Kezar totally delivered - the place was packed, with nearly every tv tuned to the game, complete with audio. There were fans screaming, drinking, and doing what people do in a real sports bar, not a pseudo-sports-hipster one.", "author": "Kim S."}

A LOT!  I mean, I eat out all the time, but I also love to cook so it's usually 50/50.\n\nAs I walked down Irving, I noticed a surfboard and a sign that read \"The Taco Shop.\"  \n\nI peeked in and noticed a bunch of T.V.'s with sports and plenty of beers in the coolers.  So, without hesitation I bellied-up to see what I could find.\n\nTo my complete shock and delight, I discovered that they had the same menu as Nick's Crispy Taco's, the place on Polk and Broadway.  I had a mild addiction to the food there and knew that I was in good hands.\n\nFast forward to about $200 of my own money, another $300 with friends from out of town, another $500 in recommendations and a very pregnant friend who had to have the fish burrito everyday for the last weeks of her pregnancy and it's obvious where I stand.  The food is consistently good, fresh and made the same way every time.  \n\nI love the Carne Asada Taco Nick's Way ($4.50) and the California Burrito ($7.25).  The quesadillas are massive and stocked-full of cheese and fresh ingredients. ($4.00-$7.50).  They are big enough to share. \n\nThat is the love part.\n\nLet's discuss my mild frustration:  the service.\n\nI have learned to stick my head in to see who is working.  I have 2 favorites who usually work during the day.  Never drama, always friendly and always efficient.\n\nThis is the hard-part for me.  I know only too well how a day can go pear-shaped for numerous reasons, but I do know when  staff is collectively pickled in alcohol and while it seems fun, it can also be really annoying when you have to repeat your order several times.  I actually can deal with it, but if someone came in for the first time, they might consider it a turn-off. \n\nI recommend getting anything for take-out, and if it is busy, think-twice.

The tacos were great, but begged for a side of pickled jalapenos, red onion and carrots--condiments found at most Mexican street vendors I like. However, if you like spicy, you can order fresh jalapenos on the side.\n\nI disagree with other reviewers' complaints that the salsas are spicy. I really, really like spicy and found the salsas to be tasty and fresh but mild with fire. I hope they get a spicier option.\n\nThe service was fast and attentive. Underdog's has an average selection of beer at average SF prices, a nice neighborhood place to get a drink and a tasty dinner. I recommend both the carnitas taco, as the pork is not dry but moist and flavorful, and the pollo taco which had a delicious marinade/sauce.", "author": "Michael K."}

We weren't too hungry (being that we both had just eaten ice cream cones from a soft serve truck we stumbled upon in golden gate park) but still wanted something savory to munch on.  Off we went to The Taco Shop. The after work crowd was already showing up but we were able to snag a table near the front. Waitress was friendly and speedy. It was happy hour so we both got the street tacos with chicken and some chips and guac. Bf also got a Tecate. Food was satisfying, but chicken meat was a bit dry so we doused with salsa. Guac was very fresh. Great place to stop by for a quick bite or come watch a Bay Area sports game over some brewskis with the buddies. I'd return if I was in the area and try out some of the other food choices from their menu.", "author": "Liv A."}

Tacos.\n\nThree items that when combined with some Bay area locals is a recipe for truly a great ~3+ hours! Right off of 19th, the moment you walk into Underdogs Taco Shop you know you're in Giants territory. Obviously during the games the place gets packed, but that doesn't stop the staff from pumping out great food at quick speeds. \n\nMy friends and I came here post game so we worked around the crowd. We made it for Taco Tuesday so immediately it was a round of drinks and stacks of tacos. We ordered the trio: beef, pork and fish; as we waited the staff helped us keep the night going after an awesome win by sharing shots with us!\n\nAs our food arrived after a few moments we were all happy to see how plump each tortilla was. For 1$ each they were definitely a pick when it came to portion size. Ranking the three, I felt that the pork and beef were close ties, with both moist and flavorful and definitely went  well with a nice cool Blue moon ;D. As for the fish, I wasn't very impressed as the other two; the fish was only slightly warm and seemed to flake apart as i bit into the taco- a real downer.\n\nFor sure I will be coming here again in the near future as Giants baseball gets kicked off. Though the tacos weren't spectacular, this is an establishment that you go to more for the environment with the food being a plus personally. With the staff and owners being Giants fans this place is a must go if you're looking for a place to hang out, grab a beer and to enjoy the game with a bunch of locals routing for the same team.", "author": "Jon K."}

Awesome atmosphere. \n\nDefinitely enjoy the Baja fish taco done Nick's way. $1 street tacos on tuesday. The grande nacho is enough for four. I'd recommend the nachos with steak. It's less dry than the chicken. There is too much sauce going on with the chicken, guac, and beans -- resulting in moist chips. \n\n--the reason for writing this review--\n\nOne thing that I found disturbing today after being a patron here for quite some time was an incident with a server cleaning the table.\n\nA party in front of us had just cleared out so the server was cleaning the table. She stacked all the cups on top of each other and there was one cup with water in it. She poured that water back INTO the pitcher of water and stacked that cup with the rest and brought it to the bar. \n\nIn my head I'm thinking ok maybe she'll throw out the water but then again when do you ever notice pitchers of water being cleaned? Ok so I proceeded to pay more attention. \n\nSo the the cups were brought to the back of the bar and then the pitcher of water was placed next to another pitcher.. One that had soda? At the end of the bar. Still curious of what's going to happen next, I continued to watch. \n\nA different server placed two new pitchers of water with ice next to the other pitchers. Moments later a table was seated and the pitcher (that had water poured back into it) was presented to that party. \n\nI've been here several times and enjoyed it every time. But I am staying away from the water for sure. Whether that water was touched or not, it should've never been poured back into a pitcher (that would eventually be used again later).", "author": "Larry H."}

One normal and another Nick's way... and yes.. we can all say, \"what? 4.50 - 5.50 for a fish taco?!?\" but it's so worth it! I loved the taco's Nick's way because the hard shell taco was so crunchy and added so much extra texture to it. The fish was piping hot when I bit into it and the batter was so crisp! They added the perfect amount of guac, thinly sliced cabbage, onions, and tomatoes. Top it off with some of the hot sauce they make and you have the perfect crunchy textured and full of flavor fish taco.   \n\nThe nachos looked delicious and I noticed they have grilled corn and totally regret not spending more time looking over the menu so it looks like I'll be returning soon to try the rest of the menu.", "author": "Helen M."}

I loved the atmosphere, the food was great and it had plenty of screens to watch the Giants' playoff game. \n\nI would easily have given it 5 stars.  But rude staff always ruins a good time.  Here at the Taco Shop, it was the Asian waitress with the glasses.  I know it's busy, but she was rude, snappy, sarcastic and abrupt. After she finished getting our order, the other people at the table with us (who we didn't know) looked at us with wide eyes. \"Dude, that girl was rude\".\n\nBut then things got weird. Later when I had a complaint (something unrelated), she was rude again, I asked to speak to a manager and she brought the bartender over.\n\nNow, instead of asking what's wrong or ANYTHING, the first thing out of his mouth was \"Get out!  GET OUT!\".  I almost started laughing at the uninformed tough guy routine.  I was like, \"Woah, I have done nothing to warrant being kicked out of anywhere.  I asked to see the manager.  You're gonna kick me out for complaining?\".\n\nI will say, after he listened, he helped resolve the situation, so I think he was just a little over anxious and excited to be the muscle. haha.\n\nI even gave the rude waitress a 20% tip because of her hard day . . . but that doesn't mean that I don't think the ASIAN WAITRESS WITH GLASSES AT THE TACO SHOP AT UNDERDOG'S doesn't need to take a courtesy class or not work big days that she can't handle emotionally or mentally\n\nGreat place though\n\nThe end.", "author": "Jacob R."}

One order with a glass of really cold beer and there you have it. The perfect meal. MmmHmmm. A beer battered Pescado Baja Style fish taco and the grilled fish taco fed two people. I ordered the Pescado Baja \"Nick's way\" and the grilled fish as normal. The tacos come wrapped with two soft tortillas, but Nick's way has a FRIED inner tortilla layer and a soft outer layer. The extra crunch from the tortilla goes hand in hand with the fried fish from the Pescado. SUPER DELISH. The grilled fish was pretty good, but having it \"Nick's way\" was definitely more impressionable. They also have some amazing hot sauces to douse your tacos with.  \n\n*Warning* the ORANGE one is their Habanero (pronoucned AHbanero) sauce. I've only had one experience with Habanero and it went something like this: A tiny drop landed in my nostril. Less than 3minutes later I was crying like a baby. In fetal position. And cursing the living lights out of the Brazilians (I was at a Brazilian cafe). Ok, the fetal position and cursing was a lie (I heart Brazilians). And the crying was more like tearing, but I was in pain for a good 10minutes. Irving you surprised me.\n\nI felt strange being out there getting tacos and not a tapioca drink or something instead, but hey, it was worth it. It's really more like 4 stars, but I'm giving them an extra star for trying to blend in (they have their store name in Chinese outside on their sign as well). Very cute.", "author": "Alesia T."}

Now I realize that we messed up by forgetting to ask for the card back when they forgot to bring it with the check. But the card was in their possession, and at the very least an \"I'm sorry we misplaced your card\" would have been nice. Instead, my boyfriend was told by the waitress that she was too busy to help him, so he lost a card and they lost two customers (at least).

The chips, when they are hot, are really good.  \n\nOne tip I would give is when ordering the chips & salsa or chips & guacamole- definitely ask for the salsa on the side.

These beer-battered, Nick's Way fish tacos are the best I've ever EVER had. I just kept shaking my head as I ate them because every bite exploded with amazingness. Nick's Way is the only way, btw.  Next time I visit SF, I'm driving directly from the airport to Underdog's. I intend to drag everyone I know to this place just so they can experience this for themselves. The fish is *SOO* not fishy - hard to tell its fish! Its just soft velvetyness. The secret sauce is beyond compare. The crunchy crispy outside complements the texture of the fish so its not a mushy soft experience like most fish tacos are. The guac is great and doesn't overpower. This is a seriously orchestrated experience by a chef who knows what he's doing. The humble fish taco is now a culinary experience. What an entertaining, pleasant surprise.

First I came here to watch the Giants game with some of my friends.  I'm not a big sports fan so I spent most of my time observing. And here is what I found:\nWe sat down, looked at the menu and within 2 minutes someone came over and asked us what we wanted for food and drinks.  Our food came and some dude came over to see if we were enjoying our food.  I told him it reminded me of Nicks (I had no idea it was NICK) and he shook his hand to introduce himself.  He said a few words and then back to business.  It was after a huge game day!\n\nThen, as I was eating my food I started observing the staff.  If you have worked in the food industry before; here is where we'll trade notes.  The bar is impeccable.  The staff is always moving, cleaning, taking orders, picking up extra bottles and it shows.  Counters are always clean.  There's no \"that's not my area\" bs going on.  The alcohol is arranged neatly and there was a very tight system here for restocking, replenishing and making sure the beers were ice cold and in buckets.  I am impressed.  \n\nNext I wanted to see how the rest of the place was organized and designed.  The floor is linoleum which is what we use in the hospital. Wise choice Nick.  Its clean, has a good coefficient of friction and its not STICKY.  This is miracle for a sports bar that serves plump tacos.  \n\nAnd now the crowning jewel of my experience was the bathrooms.  They were clean.  On game day they were shockingly clean, well stocked and yes I could see the floor.  I know now that Nick takes alot of pride in the whole establishment.  \nIts a clean, efficient and FUN sports bar.  Thanks Nick for opening this joint!

On Fridays they serve  50 cent margaritas from 6-6:30pm.\n\nThe place was packed, and we stood around for a while for a table to open up.  A table never opened up, as everyone was busy watching the baseball game that was on, seriously $1 tacos is just a cheap excuse to stay and watch the game.  Luckily people are willing to share the table so we were able to squeeze in.  So just ask.\n\nWe had the nacho with carne asada, and I was ready for 10 of the $1 tacos, and a margarita.  The nacho is huge.  Freshly fried  chips topped with beans, a lot of meat, cheese, pico de gallo, quacamole, jalapeno, and a side of sour cream ($9.75).  Tasty and really a meal in itself, with all five food groups represented into a single pile of goodness.\n\nSo after my friend and I split the nacho I was able to eat....one taco.  Such a shame, I know.  I had the carne asada version.  It was simple but still good, and the hot soft corm tortilla makes it.  The margarita was really good, not watered down like at so many places.  \n\nNow I know what to do if a Tuesday fails me.

Not something I would want to pay $6 for at least. \n\nThey only get 3 stars because of the great service they gave us. THey served us food still even though it was 11:55pm (kitchen closes at 12). Even though there was only 4 of us and we went there strictly to just get tacos and no drinks, our waitress still checked in on us every 5 minutes.", "author": "Annie L."}

I asked one of the guys carrying food passing by who seemed really busy (came on a Tuesday night) if we just sit down. He said yes and he'll be there to take our order. What surprised me was that it said taco Tuesdays were 1$ each but it's actually 2$ each! But those tacos were good. But not worth 2$ each. I do recommend the Nick's way tacos, worth the 4-5$. I got the Baja fish Taco and it made me sick. My stomach hurt and it was the only thing I ate besides a taco. ( I didn't eat much that day) so maybe that was it. I really liked it at the time.

When you first hear the name, you think about a small, rundown place that serves borderline Mexican food. Luckily, it's actually a decent sized bar that serves pretty good Mexican food.\n\nThe tacos aren't anything spectacular, but they are definitely delicious. If price weren't an issue, I would eat here more often and definitely get it Nick's Way. However, tacos here can get pretty pricey (two tacos can run you over $10). If you do decide to chow down, order it Nick's Way (an extra price, but worth it) and definitely use ample amounts of their red sauce they give to you complimentary. \n\nTheir chips and salsa are a nice and cheap finger food that makes me happy while I sip my beer (or depending on the day, a long island). The drinks are made pretty well (depending on the bartender of course). Last time I was there, I ordered a long island and it came out tasting funny... at the suggestion of a friend, I should try the female bartender next time.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is alright. The patrons are a nice mix of races (not like a completely Asian bar-Dragon Lounge- or a completely white bar-buckshot.) I did notice, however, that the staff seems to be very... Abercrombie. They're good looking white people (hey, i'm not hating...

Underdog's California Burrito is very simple: cheese, french fries & pico de gallo salsa with carne asada, carnitas, or pollo. Usually I'm Super Burrito kinda guy with a lot of ingredients to satisfy my appetite, but this place definitely filled me up. The seasoned fries crunching with each bite of the carne asada burritto made me think of the Carne Asada Fries from San Diego. \n\nUnderdog's, the quality of your taqueria food is uncanny! The sports bar atmosphere just makes me want to stay longer after my meal! Once again...good job!", "author": "Paul D."}

You know how typically eating a taco results in good amount of the goods falling out of its shell? Well, the tacos at Underdogs are an exception - order the fish tacos Nick's way and you get a half crispy/half soft taco wrapped like an ice cream cone topped with a mound of guacamole all ready to be picked up and eaten.\n\nTuesdays at Underdogs is Taco Tuesday, meaning $1 street tacos. They're good but wimpy compared to the fish tacos. Street tacos may be good for a snack but you may have to eat about 6 of them to feel like you had a real meal. I definitely preferred the tacos Nick's way. The environment is fun, especially for sports watchers because there are several TV's right in front of the bar, they also have a bball arcade game in the back. I'm not sure if Underdog's is only crowded on Tuesdays or everyday, but it was busting with people.

I couldn't believe after 6 years of living in San Francisco I FINALLY found a place that had a California Burrito.\n\n If you don't know, a California Burrito is basically carne asada fries stuffed into a burrito. It probably has thousands of calories, but after you take a bite you forget all that.\n\nAnyway, me and the boyfriend went there and it's actually a really cool sports bar. They have about 4-5 tables (that seats 4 each) in the front, tables towards the back of the bar, and the rest of seating is at the bar. They have sports paraphernalia everywhere, which I really liked.\n\nWe ordered the chips and salsa, which sounds really plain but it was actually really, really good! The chips are made fresh as well as the salsa, which has a little bit of spice that I like. I, of course, ordered the California Burrito and I was pleasantly surprised. The burrito had guacamole and sour cream, the meat had a lot of flavor, and the fries were crispy! Mmm... I wish I had one right now.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the tacos. He had several kinds: the \"street style\" tacos and 2 of Nick's Way tacos (the carne asada and chicken). Underdog's used to have the $1 Taco Tuesdays where they have the street style tacos for only $1 but I don't think they have that anymore.

The eating area were of wooden picnic tables, extremely tight as the person behind me had their back graze across mine a few times. Extremely dim lighting. Some arcade-like games also were in the back. Families even came to this place, which was surprising to me, as the bar is larger than the eating area for groups in the back.\n\n Everyone had their taco's Nick's Way. Shared the 2 tacos with one of them. I got the pescado \"baja\" style, as she had the carne asada. We also shared the San Francisco burrito w/ carne asada. The other two had their own two tacos of shrimp, carne asada (ordered carnitas but they gave her carne asada, accidently) and 2 veggies.\n\nWhen the tacos came, seriously. they looked like they were on steroids. Extremely obese (can you even call food, obese?) and topped with a large heap of guacamole. A crunchy taco shell wrapped with a flour tortilla on the outer. They give you a salsa verde, and I guess some special red creamy one. My friend asked for the habanero. HOLY MOTHER. It was so spicy I had underestimated it. I love spicy food, and squirted a giant glob, BIG MISTAKE. My lips reacted quickly and numbed out. 2 of them also reacted the same way with a DAMN that's some SERIOUS SAUCE.

I think Nick's Way is usually another $0.95, but Underdog's charges an extra $1.00.  \n\nAlso ordered the steak nachoes-- they were GREAT.  I think the best nachos I've had were at La Burrita (Berkeley, CA), but these ones came pretty close because you get a MOUNTAIN of nachos, cheese, freshly made salsa with delicious diced tomatoes, a sprinkling of steak (or a meat of your choice), jalapenos, beans and a dollop of that delicious guacamole with cream cheese on the side.

They always suggest something good to my friends if they don't know what to order. Only once did they not have an ingredient to make my drink (it was Cinco de Mayo and slamming).\nThe reason I give them 4 stars is because they close early. Midnight during the week, and 2am on the Friday and Saturday. A couple of the other bars around the area are open later so I usually end up going somewhere else when they close. So I say, start here, and if you end early great. If you keep going, there's always something else somewhere else!", "author": "Chris L."}

It was small, two bites and you're done! It was also dry and just a few pieces of meat on tortilla and a sprinkle of greens. The Nick's Way fish taco was fantastic! I have to say that the fish taco here was mucho beuno than San Diego's and I'm sure there are legit Mexicans making them in the back! (JK. I'm not being mean here) The taco was slightly on the expensive side, $5.25 for one piece of deliciously beer battered fish showered in lettuce, pico de gallo, and a blob of guacamole. I shoulda ordered another one, but it'll keep me coming back for more.\n\nI came during a Giants/Dodgers game and the atmosphere was wondeful. I miss being around crowds of SF Giants loving-fans and not just boring Padre commentators from a CRT television in San Diego. \n\nSeats are first-come first-served, so come early or be swift at grabbing open tables.

I've never understood and I guess I never will. \nToday was the day that set me over the top. My friends and I finally sit down, and we order 2 orders of vegetarian nicks way tacos, chips and salsa (FUCKING $6.50!) and one order of chicken tacos. The waitress brought everyone their order and called them out correctly (which is more than I can say for other servers), and we began to eat. Halfway through mine I noticed that the taco I was eating was chicken, and I started flipping out because I've been vegetarian for 6+ years because of serious food allergies. I called the waitress over and she said she was sorry 100+ times, and then declared that she didn't know what to do next. So I kindly suggested that she remove the incorrect order from our table and replace it with the correct one. She then agreed she would do so. They brought out the order 10 times as fast and I couldn't even eat more than two bites because I was so upset. Before she flicked the bill at the table, the waitress announced that her manager approved her request to remove the chips and salsa as well as my tacos from the bill.

Crispy delicious goodness topped off with a hardy helping of fresh guacamole. By the way, I love their guacamole. Number two on my list is the Grilled Corn & Black Bean Taco Salad. It is so damn good. It's so fresh and I absolutely love the dressing they use. And finally number three is a relatively new favorite of mine: The Carnitas Quesadilla. The cheese and meat are perfectly enveloped in a thick and crispy shell. Are you hungry yet? \n\nThey also have a pretty great selection of beers both on tap and bottled as well. Their happy hours a great, especially the one dollar street tacos. They are small but a few will definitely fill you up. I also like their 50 cent margarita happy hour although I dislike that it's only between 6:00-6:30. But that just means you have to drink fast. \n\nThis really is a great place.

Maybe back in my college days, maybe when it's the only thing nearby with booze, but it's not my first choice. The space is big though, great for groups and fairly cheap. It's great pre, post and during hangover food as well.  \n\nThat being said, we came with a semi-large group. The waitstaff was friendly, but not very organized. After having our orders taken, some of us didn't get our food for 45 minutes, while others had theirs in about 5. Tacos should never take that long, and especially before 7 on a weeknight. It was just awkward.\n\nWhen my taco finally arrived I was a little underwhelmed. It was kind of like the Taco Bell Gordita. Basically, it's a soft taco, with another crispy shell. There's your secret. I had one pork and one chicken. Nothing blew me away and I fear I won't feel the need to trek back out to the outer sunset again. The guac was good though!\n\nThe house margaritas were dandy, but I did feel a bit guilty with my foul mouth and food and friends while oh, 3 families surrounded us with their tribes of kids and strollers. I'm old fashioned, I like to drink and keep the kids at home. Call me crazy, but it just added to the less than stellar tacos, long waits between drinks and the screaming babies...these things do not a good night make for me. \n\nHad it not been for the friends that I love, the good company and nice family friendly feel of Underdogs (thank god there was a minimum of men screaming at the tv's) I might be scarred for life.

The salsa was okay okay, nothing special. The chips and salsa was definitely not worth it because it fills you up before the delicious tacos!\n\nThe Pesce Baja Fish Taco was to die for! The creamy, slightly spicy sauce went hand in hand with the prime fillet of fish, beer battered to perfection. The crispy outer battered shell of the fish contrast well with the soft tender fish. Outstanding flavor! The fish smell was not overpowering at all, barely noticeable in fact. I had it Nick's Way, as other reviewers have said: soft taco melted cheese on it and then a crispy taco inside it. The crispy taco really made the difference I think in terms of texture because it blended unbelievably well with the crispy batter and the soft fish. I can't say enough about this taco, but I'll have to go on to the carne asada taco.\n\nLoaded with chopped tomato and nicely cubed carne asada, the taco was above average, but for the price, nothing special. If you like carne asada, you will like this taco, but the taste is just like any other carne asada taco. I had it Nick's Way as well, making it better, but still a normal steak taco. It did not have the flavor-bursting sauce that the Baja Fish taco had.\n\nTogether the two taco combo and the chips and salsa, filled me to the brim.

He was totally cool with it and left us to watching our bruins get slaughtered--he even poured us 2 glasses of water which we thought was nice.\n\nTHEN 26 sec left in the game: an Asian Girl bartender came up to us:\n\nGirl: Have you ordered anything?\nMe: No\nGirl: *with some attitude* Would you like to order anything?\nMe: Yeah in about 26 seconds (staring at the tv screen behind her)\n\nThe girl looks behind her to see the screen we were watching. She walks behind the bar and get this--CHANGE THE CHANNEL to another bball game and turns off the tv next to it. WOW, that was nice of her. The last thing we saw was a foul shot at 26 seconds. The girl ruined our time there--not only were we upset from being out of the tournement but now we felt extremely unwelcome there. So we left and i told the girl, \"THANKS FOR CHANGING THE CHANNEL\" and she gave me a thumbs up. R-u-d-e. \n\nThe sad part is, I was really looking forward to trying their food finally(my old post is below) and shoot some hoops after the game. In general I like the ambiance of the bar (which is why we drove all the way back here.) i mean the bar wasnt even half full, why the cold shoulder?\nWe were just sitting there and when the game is on, down to the seconds, can we not be harassed the last 26? Its a SPORTS bar--Was there no understanding of how big this game was to its fans?  Oh and it was kind of obvious i was a fan with a fat UCLA jersey on. Really doubtful that it was a coincidence. I know she is just one bartender there, but feel offended that such pissy behavior is being tolerated. \n\n\nThe first time I went here, this blonde bartender was really friendly-didnt rush our orders at all (we waited for our entire party before ordering.) So it shows that not all the bar servers here are sourpusses.\n\nByebye to the Bruins in the NCAA tourny, I am sorry I couldn't be with you in your last moments!   :(  :(  :(", "author": "Amy S."}

For a sports bar on a tuesday night with regular season games it was pretty full. The crowd was pretty subdued, an excellent way to spend a tuesday evening. Fantastic place to watch some games and a have a few drinks.\n\n\nWe had some tacos, chips and salsa, and a pitcher of beer. The food was great and the prices were good. The chips had fresh picco de gallo on it but my favorite was the two squirt bottles filled with a green salsa (tomatille?) and one with an orangeish salsa. I think it was meant for the street tacos but I loaded them onto the chips either way.\n\nThe tacos were also delicious albeit a tad bit on the small side. Good news is that it's only $1 on tuesdays, or during happy hour M-F 4:30 - 6pm. I had seven of those buggers filled with a touch of lime and a generous squirt of salsa. The chicken taco was by far the most mouth watering and delicious, followed by the carnitas if you want variety. Personally, I would just stick with the chicken.

The waitress comes over (I believe her name was Jess?) and takes our order and DOES NOT WRITE IT DOWN!  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!  Even someone with the best memory ever would have a hard time with all the combinations... there is a point where your pride needs to be swallowed and just grab the pen and paper.  SERIOUSLY - this error on her part caused our lunch break to be over two hours.  The orders came, and as we all anticipated, it was F'd up.  No real apology either.  She offered some chips for free, which we got about 30 minutes later.  The food probably took another 45 minutes - not joking unfortunately!  Half of our group ate while the other half waited... some had to leave to get back to meetings - so those who were still waiting on food had to stay.  They did not even try to push through the messed up orders.  I was one of the fortunate ones who got my order correct, but I didn't want to be rude so I held off on one of my Tacos... mmmmm rubbery cold shrimp taco!\n\nI really REALLY want to give one star, but I can't because seriously the food is that good.  Maybe carryout from now on?  Maybe call ahead with my order to then sit and eat there?

I always get the veggie and fish tacos, it's tough to find quality fish at restaurants but this place hasn't disappointed. \n\nThe bar also has 5 huge televisions and several other small tvs that always play Giants games, football, soccer and any other sports games you desire.

I don't take part in the slow movement so much, as it is really meat heavy. Unless we are talking about cooking dinner in my apartment. My old roommate Vanessa said I am a great cook, but damn, she can't wait two hours to eat. \nI went to Underdog's on a whim with some friends, as one of them knew the bartender and therefore we'd get 'hooked up'.  Whatevs.  I love drinking and I love tacos. I could tell I was gonna like the food as soon as our chips and salsa came.  SO COLORFUL AND FRESH! I mean, really? In a bar? I was not expecting this.\nI ordered the vegetarian tacos, which come Nick's Way, as in a crispy corn tortilla wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.  YES AND YES.\nI went again today, as I like to hit that place up after shivering my ass off at Ocean Beach. I mean, I always tend to get some color, which is why I go, but that wind chill I could do without. \nTaco Salad.  SO AMAZING. The best part is that it is a vegan entree, so I don't have to waste time asking for no cheese, no sour cream, and then stress out it's going to come with those condiments anyway. Cilantro Lime vinaigrette? Done. Fresh tomatoes and delicious guacamole? Done. The best part, other than how it tastes, is that it doesn't come in a heavy, fried tortilla shell-the part of the salad I always try to abstain from and then demolish in 30 seconds flat.  Nope. Instead they decoratively top the salad with tortilla spears. Since I am no fun, I'm getting the salad without those next time. \nTwo dollar Tecates at Happy Hour.  \nThe first time I went to Underdog's, my other friend informed me of a second Underdog's up the street (different place of business completely). Second Underdog's serves sausages and has an extensive vegan menu! Plus it's organic. So after gorging on chips, salsa and tacos, I found room in my stomach for a vegan sausage.  And then went home and made seitan.  It's not like I'm a marathon runner-I cannot explain this appetite. \nGo to the beach and then treat yourself right at The Taco Shop At Underdog's. It's tiring trying to keep warm/drinking all afternoon on the sand. Believe me, I know. But if you go to the beach with your friend's kid, who happens to be under two years old, this might not be the best place. It's one thing on an average day, but if it's game day, this place can get pretty bro -y. Someone might yell, \"Kids in a bar, great idea' at you.  Dislike.", "author": "Jenny B."}

The Taco Shop and Underdog's definitely delivered in that respect. \n\nAfter some grocery shopping in the area, we stopped by here to pick up a late dinner. I'm not sure what it would be like during a game, but it had a great laid-back vibe for a place that is ostensibly a sports bar. There are quite a few TVs spread out around the place, so I was able to watch them play highlights of Tebow-time during the latest comeback vs. the Bears while waiting for my order to come out. The guy behind the counter was awesome. When we walked up to order, he was really friendly and seemed like he actually cared when he asked how we were doing. We order a Baja (fish) burrito and a carne asada taco Nick's way. Food took about 10-15 minutes to come out, which was fine because it gave me some time to enjoy a Green Flash IPA. I've only gotten take-out from this place, but will try to come for a game soon. They have some benches toward the back that will accommodate bigger groups. \n\nNow for the food. Sadly, I can only say that it was good, but not quite as good as the original Nick's. The fish burrito is stuffed with some pieces of fried fish and cabbage. While the flavor was very good and the fish was well-fried, the thing was kind of lightweight. Pretty much just the fish, some cabbage, and some salsa wrapped in a big tortilla. The carne asada taco was really good, though, topped with big gobs of guacamole, and stuffed to the gills with tender bits of carne asada. \n\nSeems like a cool sports bar and with good food, that's a W in my book.", "author": "Saunders C."}

This one is better than the ones at Obon festival! corn with parmesan cheese, butter and cayan pepper sounds gross but it is delish!\n\nService is getting better so I would def visit again and try other things on the menu.\n\nSKIP: potsticks! the garlic sauce is extremely pungent. Got pulled over after underdogs once and get away with a fix ticket. The cop only smelled the garlic in my breath. guess it's a good thing (?!) since I didn't have to kiss anyone that night.", "author": "Stefanie Y."}

It's a nice little bar, and very accommodating to sports fans. My pros and cons:\n\nPros\n*While the bar isn't particularly large, they've got a ton of nice HD TV's. I've never counted, but there's enough to accommodate numerous games and I've never seen someone leave because there wasn't a set to show their game.\n\n*They've got all the sports packages, so as a general rule they can show your game, even if its obscure. The staff also knows how to actually work their remotes, which is not always the case at sports bars (go figure).\n\n*The owners are nice as all get out, very friendly and treat their regular customers very well-- always a plus.\n\n*While the bar isn't stocked with the obscure spirits I enjoy they do have a good sampling from the major distributors. I'm not a huge beer fan so I can't really comment, but its my impression they have an OK, but not amazing selection. They do have fat tire, though, which is always a reasonable beer fall back.\n\n*The drink prices aren't bad.\n\n*The food is pretty decent, and decently priced by sports bar standards. The menu also offers some choices beyond the typical fried sports bar crap, including some hawaiian plates and noodles. Not amazing stuff, but you're not really there for fine dining, you know?\n\n*The bar is clean as all get out. Seriously, its almost weird how clean it is.\n\nCons\n*The space isn't huge, so it can get crowded. Not sure there's a lot they can do about this, but it can be annoying. Ditto the terrible parking situation in the area.\n\n*Remember how I said it was clean? It's like, REALLY clean. To the point of being sort of sterile. They've been working on the decor, but it could still use a little help.\n\n*Some of the drunk dudes I've encountered here really don't get the meaning of \"go away\".\n\nIn sum, if you want a place to watch a game in the Sunset, Underdogs is a good bet.", "author": "Catherine H."}

As many reviews before me have emphasized, the pescado nicks way is seriously to die for. But no matter what your choice is (I've also had the carne asada and the pollo, which are pretty good alternatives), these are not small little tacos- the tacos def come with what's promised on the menu, and these babies will fill you up. \nWhile I do like the chips and salsa, my favorite starter is the Elote con Queso. For $3.50, you get the most flavorful fresh corn on the cob you could ask for. Seems pretty pricey, but most people probably could never season it that way. \nThe vibe is borderline sports bar/dive bar meets a taqueria, with a bar, picnic table seating, little arcade games in the corner, etc. If you are looking for a really chill place to hang with your buddies and watch sports while eating really great mexican food, this is the place! \nThe bartenders and the waiters/waitresses are what makes this place a five star restaurant for me. Even when understaffed, they really try their best keep things moving and to get your order in on time. You can also watch many sporting events of your interest... this one woman wanted to watch some random bowling tournament, so the bartender tuned into some obscure channel for her (next to a March Madness game). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's pretty quality service. \nit honestly beats most other taquerias in that it still maintains some of that Mexican authenticity while adding its own twist to the food and the restaurant in general.", "author": "Guri G."}

Yes, you're entitled to your oppinions but some of them are straight oppinions.  \"...tailored towards the asian crowd..\" umm, I walk in here and I do not see fish tanks, asian characters, noodles, or whatever it is that attracts \"asians\" into a place.  Pretty uneducated oppinion in my view because when you first walk in, I see a sports bar with a long bar, seating for big groups and small groups, tons of TVs, and sports memorabilia.  Don't see 1 specific team being promoted, don't see no signs of a specific \"race\" it's trying to pull in, don't see 1 specific \"gender\" or \"sexual orientation\" if you really must go that far.  Better quote for that person might be, \"Don't go to SF because it's tailored towards asians\".\n\nThe place looks like a sports bar and not highlighting a single team or sport--well, dont see a lot of soccer stuff or other sports memorabilia but i'm guessing that's what the owner wanted.\n\nThe reviews that were supposedly left by \"friends\" are probably a good thing because that means the place is not boring, empty, and limited and if you can't get your friends to like the place, imagine trying to get strangers to like it. Those are probably good friends but I'm sure most places use friends for reviews.  I'll admit, I got to know the owner and now I'm a friend and I bring in some co-workers and other friends to the place sometimes.\n\nFood is decent, haven't tried all the items on the menu and i'm not going to give the place a bad or good review based on that.  I pose a question to all you reviewers, \"Have you tried all the alcohol behind the bar and the drinks the place mixes?\"  \"How about the food, have you tried all of them?\"  I'm guessing no--I know I haven't so I'm not going to give a full review of that.  I like the nachos and the popcorn chicken.  I also like it when I order a pitcher of something and they tell me that \"that beer isn't cold yet\".  At least they're looking out for me.  I'd rather have them tell me that than give me semi warm beer just to get a sale.  I can understand cuz that place was hopping for Super Bowl when I was there.\n\nMy only gripe with the place is parking.  Sucks looking for a parking spot in the area, but I can't blame that on the bar, it's just location. Most places I visit downtown--hell, most places in SF have no parking but it's because of the area not the actual restaurant/bar's fault.  \n\nI've visited the place more than a handful of times and I've seen asians, caucasians, afro/blacks, hell I even see filipinos in there.  I think the bar has added some business to the area as well.  I know I eat pizza, vietnamese, and get starbucks sometimes before, during, and after i go there.\n\nOverall, I say this is a good place to drop by and watch games, drink a few things, and eat a few things, and hang out with friends.  NAME ME ANOTHER SPORTS BAR IN THE AREA that is;\n1) as big\n2) as lively (mostly weekends)\n3) has the same if not more TVs (these aren't the tube TVs btw people)\n4) shows PPV sports without charging at the door\n5) has friendly staff\n6) and Hell!

Food took a while and being there on my own, feeling a mix of revolutionary, wall flowerish, and non-confrontational, decided not to get all up in Nick's grill about my tacos taking their own sweet time to arrive. That turned out to be the right move because if things don't work out, the good bartenders at Underdog's have a simple solution: ..... ply you with alcohol until you can't stand. I mean who would miss a couple of tacos after several shots of bourbon, a Tecate, two pints and another \"I'm sorry shot\" just to make you feel at home. I haven't been that sedated since my Tonsillectomy. Got service with a smile when the taco showed, but who cares about two lil' ol' tacos when yer fallen off the bar stool all drunk off yer ass.

You have to order it and wait around for a while (and sometimes it's very noisy with 20-somethings making more than their share of noise).  And food-wise their choices are limited (for my burrito they only had one type of beans). The burrito I had tasted good. It was also the THE most expensive burrito-to-go I've ever had in San Francisco (they even charge 25 cents extra for a burrito with carne asada).  My simple burrito (no sour cream, no guacamole) came to over $10.50.   \n\nAfter ordering I looked at my receipt and saw a 10 cent charge for the small bag the burrito was to be placed in.  San Francisco may have forced upon the public the stupid pay-for-your-bag law but this is the FIRST establishment I've been to that doesn't give you a choice and imposes the fee on you as though it is mandatory (in the past my burrito was placed in a tiny brown paper back along with a few very thickly cut chips -- I guess I've been paying the bag fee all along without realizing it).  I told the bar-girl I had my own bag for the burrito and she told me the charge was automatic and couldn't be removed.  When I told her to forget the order and give me my money back someone else working at the bar refunded my dime.  The owner also was interested in the goings-on and I told him the situation and he listened with interest but didn't react when I said I knew his establishment would go on automatically charging their customers bag fees without asking them in advance (I said this several times and several times he had no reaction at all -- that's because the Taco Shot at Underdog's will continue to force the bag fee on unsuspecting customers).  \n\nI finally got my burrito in tinfoil, no bag and no chips.  I took my burrito home with me and this is the final time I visit this establishment.\n\nSupermarkets, department stores and other food establishments don't add on this fee without permission and neither should the Taco Shop.  I wonder it, perhaps, it is illegal to do so.", "author": "Rudy G."}

I remember waiting for Dingo, after he had a short reunion with his family in San Francisco. Myself and the Jakesta, went to this bar and rendezvous with my old friend J. We arrived a bit early and the waiter (who's name escapes me at the moment), asked if we wanted to order any drinks.\n\nGiving it a good minute and a half, I decided to Stellas would go well with the occasion. It was the Lakers and Warriors game, later that night so the locals in the neighborhood would come on by, probably after the work hours are over. The ambiance is quaint, think of it as a mini Cheers bar, stuck on the edge of Chinese influenced Sunset district border. The people we're chill and heavily filled tension in the air for their favorite sports teams going head to head. J and her cohort finally show up, and after subtle introductions followed by acquainting daps, a pitcher of Sierra Nevada came around.\n\nJust then the bartender suggested, ordering more drinks before the end of happy hour and to take a look at the menu. To my surprise Underdog's menu rivals that of the east bay's own Top Dog. One dog, stood out from the rest and I was willing to give my heart another roller coaster ride from hell and back; The Danger Dog. It consisted of a nice mixed meat hot dog, with sunny side up eggs on top of the dog, with nacho cheese....how can you avoid such artery clogging goodness.\n\nThe suspense was killing me, the Sierra Nevada nearly gone, and finally my Danger Dog arrives. The bartender, again suggested a dab of chipotle sauce would do my food justice...it did. So hot, gooey, and meaty...words that can be twisted into sexual innuendo...no homo reference like manner can continued to be described. We even added a side of nachos, and a sampler, to fill our group up before the big game on the tube.\n\nThe basketball game was epic (Lakers vs. Warriors)...that is until the 4th quarter, which I had to exit stage front, because Dingo was exhausted from his mini-excursion with his aunt. Unfortunately, J and friends had to remind us kindly had we paid our leftover bill of Stella and the rest that had been accounted for. This mix up, sadly dropped the perfect score to four stars. Perhaps after maybe a good 35-40 minutes of discussion with J and the the infamous bartender, it wasn't until he discovered it was his mistake.\n\nAll was said and done, and we can go on our merry ways. Hopefully in the future the cashier can keep better track of the receipts, to ensure of quality control. Overall, thanks Underdog for reminding me how much I miss my old school lunches as a kid in grandpa's house....hot dogs and sunny side up eggs.", "author": "Ryan M."}

It is common knowledge that socal reigns supreme.  It is something that goes unquestioned; kind of like you know Chicago makes the best deep dish instead of Rhode Island.  However, I have read nothing but rave reviews about Underdogs, more specifically Nick's Way.  I just prayed this Nick was not a recent inmate and \"Nick's Way\" was not paying to get my chili ring expunged...you never know...this is San Francisco.\n\nWe came here before the Angels and Airwaves concert at the Warfield around happy hour.  They have a pretty common happy hour special: $1 streetstyle tacos and $2 tecates.  My girlfriend and I ordered the Baja fish taco Nick's way and I also ordered a Carnitas Nick's way.   The wait was a tad bit longer than I am used to for the rudimentary making of tacos however, the bar was crowded and the atmosphere was real chill leaving my patience untested.  I had an nice old man to my left and a bodacious babe to my right...that's right, just living the American dream.  This is a sports bar so there are a lot of tv's showign some sort of game.  Yesterday was the Giant's opener and the start of the NCAA title game Butler vs. Duke.  Just know Gordon Hayward, I was rooting for you all along.  The tacos were delivered by a buxom babe.  The presentation was very nice.  These were huge tacos, however, 5.85 for each was pretty steep.  Nick's way is just picca de gallo, guac.  They also give you 2 different hot sauces, one red and green, but they really tasted the same.  Biting into it, the fish was really good.  You can tell this isn't your bottom of the barrel discount fish.  It was crispy yet the taste of fish was still very distinct.  The aroma could only be matched by true organic fish taco if you catch my drift...har har har.  The carnita taco was average.  Because it was Nick's way, there was plenty of flavor, however, the carnitas, which is just braised crispy pork tasted ordinary.  We were still hungry after so we ordered 3 streetstyle tacos: pollo, carne asada, carnitas.  They weren't noteworthy at all with the pollo being the best.  The $1 streetstyle tacos are like ordinary taco truck ones, so they are really small.  You will need about 6 or 7 to be somewhat full.  \n\nThe sports bar as a whole was very authentic to its nature.  There is memorabilia everywhere along with the logos of every team and it made me feel at home.  I hope stegosaurusrider will allow me to decorate the living room in a similar fashion. (inside joke to an outside eye..sorry but you were not meant to get it).  It is dimly lit so much of people's attention are on the flat screens.  The crowd is very diverse, especially around the time I went and there are a lot of sport junkies if you want to debate on some trivial matters of why Dirk Nowitzki is so underrated yet is currently these best power foward in the game.  4 stars for the fish tacos...i have to deduct for their less then spectacular other meats.  However, you will feel right at home unless you are a shut-in venturing out for your very first time.  It will be a very nerveracking experience.  If so, engage the bartenders in a convo...they are very chill and will treat you like their own sire.", "author": "Brian V."}

It's true, ever since the recipes of Nick's Crispy Tacos came onto the scene, this place has upped it's game as far as cuisine is concerned. The staff aint so bad itself. It is a place that I can enter where I know everyone is going to say hey and poor my drink before I have to ask. They are a great staff regardless if you are regular or not.\nI highly recommend the tacos. The chicken is shredded and moist, so so so so gooood.

HOLY CRAP is this good! When I am not caring about my caloric intake, this is my choice. The pork is so juicy and flavorful, it's amazing.\nWhen I'm trying to be good, it's all about the shrimp tacos or the salad. The shrimp taco is how it sounds, grilled shrimp with nothing that makes it fatty. The salad is a shredded cabbage, romaine lettuce, black beans, grilled corn, pico de gallo, and guac combo. I choose to nix the chips and dressing because I add their amazing roasted tomato and garlic salsa!\n\nI can't say enough about this place, I'm there a little too often to be quite honest.", "author": "Sarah M."}

Then they announced they were doing Brainstormer Pub Quiz here, which gave it a whole new raison d'etre (and a bonus star).\n\nSo pub quiz is scheduled for Thursdays at 8, but they seemed to have overlooked a little something called Thursday Night (NFL) Football, which kicks in after Thanksgiving.  The game theoretically ends at 8, but of course it runs over and meanwhile the bar is so packed with roaring fans that there's barely room to breathe.  They assure me pub quiz will start by 8:30.  Still, this is right out of Party Logistics 101: always leave buffer time between two events.  So minus one star.\n\nBy 8:30 the game is over and we manage to score a table, but by the time the quizmaster gets everything set up it's 9:00, and in the meantime the bartenders are too busy clearing out all the tabs to take our food orders and some of us are getting grumbly.  So minus another star.\n\nNot exactly an auspicious start to the night, and we're expecting to lose as always, but wonder of wonders we actually won (and that in spite of doing god-awful on the double-points last round).  On the whole, it had to be the most anticlimactic possible win, but still, it earns a bonus point for historical significance if nothing else.  The prize?  $35 in Underdog's bucks.  We used them to pay for our pitchers and then got the hell out, because thanks to the late start it's now midnight on a school night.

Nick (of Nick's Crispy Tacos) can usually make a decent taco, but these were horrible! First of all, I could not taste the fish, secondly, there was no 'heat'. I had to drown my tacos in Tapatio sauce just to get some spiciness out of 'em. It's easy enough to make a good taco, so most chef's would try to stand out from the million other taco joints by focusing on some salsa or marinade to make their tacos really stand out, not Nick. He instead smothered his grilled Mahi Mahi with cold pico de gaio, lettuce and flavorless guac' (sorry, not enough flavor for the 'amole part). Also, he covered up his crispy taco shell, which he's famous for, with a soft corn tortilla, thereby making it a soft crispy tortilla combo. What is this Taco Bell??? It just defeats the purpose of having a crispy taco shell to begin with. To be honest, I would rather have had a taco from Taco bell, at least there's some flavor, albeit artificial.

Only thing I would advise not to order is the Pescado (Fried fish) taco. I barely found any fish as it looked like your ordinary frozen fish stick was dipped in batter and fried again. Barely any fish meat. Maybe it was a bad day for me but I don't think I'd order that again. \n\nCarne asada tacos are the best, always consistent and make sure you get them Nick's way. \n\nGrilled fish varies, the shrimp and mahi mahi are always good. \n\nChicken can be a bit dry at times but it's still pretty tasty thanks to the marinade and spices. \n\nQuesedilla was really awesome! Best one I've ever had. It's different from your Taco Bell or Taqueria style so prepare to be amused and amazed.", "author": "Derrick L."}

The Baja Fish Tacos \"Nick's Way\" were quite a festive balance of textures - crunchy and soft, and flavors - savory and sweet, and I will add that the guacamole serves well to envelope all of the flavors in a veil of avocado decadence.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to a return visit!", "author": "morgan p."}

It is defiantly a nice happening hang out for sunset. Defiantly could use a good cleaning.\n\nI tried to order Mexican street style tacos off the menu. I also wanted to add cheese. The server took my order then came back and told me that they couldn't do cheese on my tacos. So I figured that they were trying to cut food cost, I then asked if i could order a side of Cheese which is offered as a side on the menu, more than happy to pay or it. Amazingly she tells me No. The owner won't do it. My friend and me were shocked and asked for an explanation. The only one that multiple employees could give us is the owner is crazy and stuck in his ways which i understand if you Daniel Boulud, or Eric Ripert but Nick from a sunset Sports bar. \nSo then I ordered a least expensive taco that already had cheese on it. Im still quite perplexed over the situation. \n\nYou could see that all the servers which seemed very unhappy and had that look of a beaten dog stuck in a cage wishing they could get out. \n\nTwo nights later I came back to watch the giants game since there wasnt to many bars  to choose from in the area, I was sitting down next to a girl that sent back there order. Nick had the nerve to bring the taco out himself and said, \"Next time get it right the first time \" . The girl then said if its a big deal i will just it eat sorry for the mistake. \n\nNote to the owner: Customers are the soul of your restaurant. Sorry if daddy  use to abuse you. If you continue to treat people the way you do you will end up loosing every customer and employee. \n\n\nDont worry. Going back this week with cheese in my pocket.  \nYou may have one the battle not they war never under estimate the POWER OF CHEESE!!!", "author": "Sean J."}

My friends split a quesadilla as their \"entree\" and said it was pretty good.\n\nCredit is due for an incredibly helpful and attentive staff. They brought chips and salsa pretty much as soon as we walked in (although the chips got soggy pretty quickly under the mound of salsa...)  And they stopped by frequently to check if we needed anything.\n\nAnd I can't complain about $2 tecates.\n\nNot sure I'll head  back there just for the tacos, but if I'm in the 'hood and looking for a place for a bite and a drink, I might stop in.", "author": "Todd S."}

First off the place is sunlit. It has big front windows. Therefore, one does not feel like they are in a dungeon when they are watching a game like a lot of sports bars.\n\nSecond, the TV's are under control. They decide from the beginning which games will be showing on which TV and they post it for all to see. No more guess work or trying to get the bartender to change the channel from womens figure skating over to your team. Also the local (49ers) game will be on in the back on the big screen for all the local fans to go to, so the front 48\" HDTV's are reserved for the out of state games.\n\nThird the food. It ain't bad. If you are there with a friend I highly recommend getting the nachos to share.\n\nAnd lastly, I have yet to have a problem getting a seat.\n\nAll the ingredients for a great sports bar.

The crowd was typical for a sports bar and well the atmosphere is alright.\n\nThe negative is that the food sucked, it took about 30mins to come out, and the bartenders/waitresses weren't all that attentive. Me and a buddy were sitting for about 10 mins before they took our orders.\n\nI guess that's okay since they have pretty attractive female waitresses/bartenders.... cute faces, big tits, and nice ass makes slow service tolerable i guess...\n\nAnyway, this place is average/above average, but i'm going to -1 star for the food. Cool to come here and drink, but eat out elsewhere first. Don't order the garlic fries...they taste like something like potato flavored mix and playdough combined...was probably the worst garlic fries i've ever had in my life.\n\nAlso they didn't show the UFC PPV in HD....just standard def on the 16:9 format......but a lot of places don't either.....but they have the cheapest cover charge in the city...\n\nThere are better sport bars out there, but none as clean though!\n\nAnyway, worth a try...just avoid the food...i'd rather go to burger king.", "author": "Steven C."}

So my friend recommended a place off 7x7's top places in SF to eat. I didn't look too closely at the website and didn't know it was more of a bar that served the recommended taco. There's an actual taco shop in the mission district. Anyways we walked in - there's the bar on the right. And some high tables and chairs lining the wall on the left. We sat down in the back where there's actually like 4 wooden picnic tables. Menus are on the table. It took a little while for someone actually acknowledged us. I think the bartender actually came by to take our drink orders before our actual waitress took our order. Chips and pico de gallo came out first. The pico had huge chunks of tomatoes and tasted so fresh. I got the two taco plate - the grilled fish and the carne asada (both Nicky's way). The typical meats (chicken, beef, pork) and vegetarian tacos only came Nicky's way, which is a soft taco wrapped around a crispy taco shell and topped with some guacamole. It reminded me of the taco bell chalupa. But with the seafood ones (grilled or deep fried fish, shrimp), you get a choice of regular soft tacos or Nicky's way. It's actually an extra $1.25 for Nicky's way. And they will add that to the price to the two taco plate. The carne asada was just ok I was more impressed with the fish - seasoned with spices and topped with lettuce and salsa and a big goop of guacamole. My friends had the baja style fish, which is deep fried, which they liked as well. The tacos are pretty big and it was definitely a struggle to finish both. I also ordered a beer and cokes for my friends. But it took forever to get refills and then to get some change for our bill. It wasn't even that busy and I know the people working there looked at our table several times and still just walked by. We ended up just going to the bar to pay because we were tired of waiting.", "author": "Alison W."}

The food took SUPER long to come out.  It must have been 20 minutes and all I ordered was 3 of their $1 street tacos. \n2.  The $1 street taco wasn't even worth the $1.  First of all it smelled funny, like it was spoiled (my tummy agreed with that later), and they only consisted of 1 piece of chicken, 2 tablespoons of onions and 5 pieces of chopped cilantro.  REALLY?!!? yes really. \n3.  My group was seated next to the swinging door into the kitchen and EVERY time someone passed through those doors came a foul whiff of vomit aroma.  It was sick.  But that's just how my taco smelled too.\n4.  Inconsistency!  I ordered 3 street tacos when I first got there & it took 20 minutes.  Then later on I ordered 3 street tacos for the bf and it came out in 1 minute.  wth?!  I ordered it way earlier than he arrived, expecting to wait 20 mins and then it came in 1 min so by the time the bf got there, it was cold...and stinky!\nGood thing I had good company to try and save my experience, plus there was a big screen to watch the game.

He was just a college age guy with a towel sticking out of his jeans pocket.) came and asked us if we wanted salsa and chips ($1.50). We did. The salsa was just chopped up salsa, cilantro, red onion and maybe a little garlic. No spiciness at all. But you can tell that Underdog's doesn't use just any kind of cheap watered down tomatoes they can get. It's rare to find good tomatoes in December, but these tomatoes were bright red, with good texture and flavor. We gobbled the basket up so quickly the server asked us if we wanted another one and brought it complementary. \n\nMy bf ordered two tacos: one carnitas and one chicken, each done Nick's way. I ordered two tacos as well: one carnitas and one carne asada, both done Nick's way as well. I also ordered the elote con queso (grilled sweet corn brushed with lime salsa and covered in a mixture of mexican cheese and chili powder). \n\nThe tacos were fantastic. Because the kitchen didn't mark which tacos were which though (cause when done Nick's way, they all look the same no matter the filling), I ended up eating the chicken instead of the carne asada. Nevertheless, we both thought our tacos were pretty amazing. The tacos get tucked halfway into a paper wrapper, and the end that is sticking out gets stuffed half with salsa and half with freshly made guac. There was so much guac in one of my tacos I scooped some out with some leftover chips and had plenty left over. My bf, who is not a fan of guac, gladly ate his with zero complaints.\n\nBefore I got even halfway into my second taco, I was getting pretty full and I still had the corn to eat! The corn was just alright. I'm more used to the street version in LA, where they slather it in mayo and then roll it in cheese (sounds disgusting, tastes amazing). The cheese just tasted too salty and I had to scrape some of it off to eat the corn. I guess it really needs the mayo to balance it out. \n\nI will be back.

Nick's Crispy Taco Shop on Broadway and Polk had a huge following for many years, but Nick had a fallout with his partner (A-hole by the way), and decided to venture out on his own to Underdog's on Irving just off of 19th Avenue in The Inner Sunset.\n\nHaving heard this my friends and I were ecstatic as I live five minutes away in The Richmond. We went there on Monday afternoon at 12:30 and were greeted with a warm welcome from the cool bartender.  We ordered a couple of Anchor Steam pints ($3 each right on..happy hour price?) and were brought some chips and salsa with two squeeze bottles of hot sauces...one a mellow green chile verde and the other a spicy red traditional. The pico de gallo on the chips tasted like it was made two minutes prior to us walking...perfect taste, freshness and temperature. We proceeded to add little squirts from both bottles on to the loaded chip with salsa, and that look that my friend and I give each other whenever we realize we have hit foodie gold at first bite shined on both of our faces! Pure bliss with the fresh chips!\n\nWe each ordered a taco and a side..me a carne asada loaded and her a chicken loaded with a small side of rice and beans, and a small order of seasoned grill prawns. The food arrived within ten minutes and we dug in to our tacoes first...crunchy on the inside and soft on the outside with a generous helping of meat, cilantro and guac. The rice and beans were perfect, but what really stood out were the seasoned prawns. I've had the dish in The Mission, Mexico, and friends' homes, but these were beyond belief! The perfect combo of spice, tenderness, and grilling temp. If you had the chips and salsa with a small order of these you'd be a happy camper...but we were hungry. We devoured everything, and the tacoes were as good if not better than La Taqueria...which is saying a lot...total bill $24 with two beers, two full stomachs, and two big smiles for the rest of the afternoon. \n\nWe'll be back VERY soon...daytime at noon there were five people in the entire place, but I'm sure it was going off for the Niners Monday Night Football beatdown of the Cardinals...lots of screens for great views everywhere of games.\n\nThank you Nick for moving your shop to this neighborhood for a five minute drive of perfection!", "author": "SFNATIVE K."}

I was never too impressed by any tacos anywhere else, but I was at Chug Pub around the corner last night and being another big eats item, I had to come try Nick's Baja-Style Fish Tacos. Nick's Way is pretty much a crispy taco wrapped with a soft taco.  When I first read the description and the price ($5.25) I thought it was two different tacos, one with a crispy shell, and another with a soft one so I didn't think it was too expensive.  But even though it turned out to be just one taco, it was huge!  A BIG beer battered piece of fish topped with cabbage, lime, cilantro, and a big heap of delicious guacamole.  There was two sauces/salsa that you can top your tacos with, one green, one red.  I don't know what is in either one, but it was both really good on the taco.

So, when we finally came in for happy hour on Friday, I was pleasantly surprised. It started off with the parking which was not difficult at all, considering its location. There isn't always plenty of street parking, but it isn't impossible to find a spot nearby. Anyway, back to the bar. Their carnitas and carne asada tacos are amazing (you HAVE to try them with their sauce) and only $2 during happy hour! I've yet to try the burritos, which I heard are pretty good too. They also have $2 Tecates and as I've mentioned, dollar margaritas which can be strong, but really one of the better margaritas I've had. It's too bad they only serve them for half an hour (6-6:30pm on Fridays). All in all, service was great, food was great, drinks were great.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

SCORE!!  I landed a sweet table and waited for my friends to come.  Soon as a few others showed up the waitress came over and got our orders.  We initially just ordered chips and salsa, and a few street tacos.  The street tacos were $1, and yes because they are street tacos, they are small.  I've been to mexican joints that serve street tacos, but they do not skimp out on the meat... The street tacos here did.  There was barely any meat on there... ridiculous!  What else is ridiculous is $4.25 for a fish taco!!  $5.25 for fish tacos Nick's way.  Being the fatty that I am, I tried both of them.  I didn't enjoy the Nick's way as much as the regular Baja style fish taco.  The regular fish tacos had plenty of fish and good flavor.  I recommended it to all my friends that came.  The Nick's fish taco was harder to eat and the huge amount of guacamole on top of it masked the good saucy flavor.  Might have been better with the carne asada?  We also got the carne asada quesadilla, which was pretty darn good.  ALMOST compares to El Farolito's Super Quesadilla.  $6.50 for the carne asada quesadilla... not too bad.  It was a good decent size.  USe the green salsa on EVERYTHING. it's soooo delicious, and has a nice small kick to it! YUMMMMM\n\nUnfortunately there were no beer specials for Taco tuesday.  The service was pretty fast.  The waitress was super nice with us in allowing us to split our checks, which was a HUGE hassle for her... which I'm sure she got annoyed about. =P  Understandable...there were 20 different checks with people leaving all at different times =P\n\nI would recommend going here on any day just to try the fish tacos. Taco tuesdays aren't anything that special other than a good opportunity to meet up with friends on a Tuesday.  Oh, and get their chips with salsa ON THE side.. otherwise you'll get soggy chips.\n\nGood fish tacos, just not sure if it's worth $4.25 or the $5.25.", "author": "Diane L."}

They're normally $2, so it seemed like a pretty good deal. I also heard that Nick's Baja fish taco was THE thing to get here, so I ordered a carnitas street taco and  Nick's Baja Fish taco. We also got a complimentary platter of fresh tortilla chips and salsa while we were waiting for our tacos.. mmm.\nWhen our tacos came, I have to say the street tacos were prettyy disappointing. It was basically a tortilla with a 1:1 ratio of meat to onions. Some of the tacos looked like they only had a sprinkling of meat. On the other hand, my baja fish taco (which was 5x the price of the street tacos) was ginormous and almost 5x as big as the street taco. The beer-battered fish was huge, and was complemented well by a big serving of guacamole and lettuce, plus the crispy and soft tortillas.

The Taco Shop has the best tacos/quesadillas I have ever had in my life. (And believe me, I eat a lot of Mexican food.) The ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. I particularly loved the zesty guacamole and soft/hard tortilla shell combination with the tacos. The best part is, they let me experience this culinary masterpiece on the house!

My two friends and I ordered a beer bucket at 12:55 last night. (Tuesday, Aug. 21)  At 1 o'clock the two bartenders (a young skinny guy with a full reddish beard and a smaller brunette female) began kicking everyone out of the bar very rudely.  There was no last call and I told them that we just ordered a bucket consisting of 2 beers each 5 minutes earlier and were not told they were about to close.  The male bartender was clearly intoxicated and began telling everyone to \"get the fuck out\".  The female bartender approached the table where we had our backpacks and yelled \"who ever's stuff this is, get your shit and get out of here.\"  So we just grabbed our stuff and walked out with our full beers in hand.  It was the rudest experience I have ever had in any restaurant/bar experience.  I understand that Tuesdays are a long night for the staff and when they close, they want to get out as soon as possible.  However, using profanity and rudely kicking everyone out without a last call, right after serving someone a drink is truly terrible service.  So a large group of us stood outside, finishing our beers and talking about how terrible the two bartenders were.", "author": "Tyler J."}

This is definitely the place if you're looking for a no-frills, friendly sports bar with amazing tacos.\n\nNick, the co-owner, makes tacos \"Nick's Way\", which entails a soft flour tortilla on the outside, crunchy shell on the inside, and meat and loads of guac in the middle. It might not be the most \"authentic\" taco you've ever had, but it doesn't matter - they taste better than pretty much any other type of taco I've had! The staff usually brings you out a green and red salsa, if you're adventurous (and like spicy food) make sure to ask for the habanero sauce as well as that will hit the spot. I've also tried the quesadillas, which were alright but not my favorite - I would definitely stick to the tacos.\n\nOther perks of the bar include free chips and salsa on most nights and $2 Tecate beer while supplies last. The rest of the beer selection is decent and decently priced ($4 pints).\n\nContrary to some other people's experiences, apparently, I've always found the staff and especially Nick to be very friendly. Nick introduced himself from the first time I came and always makes a point of saying hi whenever I stop by. The bar has some nice TVs and the staff is usually accommodating in terms of changing them to the game you want to see and even raising the volume a little. There's also a picnic bench in the back - a little weird but actually pretty useful if you're coming with friends.\n\nAll in all a great place to chill, watch a game, and have some great tacos!", "author": "Nicolas L."}

Last September, Nick Fasanella, of Nick's Crispy Tacos fame in Russian Hill, and his friend and business partner Doug Marschke, teamed up to present all the things that a great sports bar and taco shop should have.  I'm talking about lots of flat screen TVs; local sports team memorabilia and banners; a dartboard in the front; a coin-operated free throw basketball hoop in the back; several classic arcade games like Ms. PacMan, Galaga and Centipede; a jukebox; high-top tables for adults and wooden picnic tables in the back for families with kids; casual but friendly and attentive service; a variety of Mexican, domestic, imported and micro-brewed beers; margaritas and sangria; and oh-so-tasty Cal-Mex food. \n\nFasanella, who was trained at the Culinary Institute of America in New York's Hyde Park, sold his namesake eatery on Broadway in 2006 and opened The Taco Shop at Underdog's Sports Bar & Grill, his fifth restaurant venture in San Francisco.  Other local projects include Tortilla Heights on Divisadero at Bush which has strong appeal with the single set, and an Italian deli in North Beach called La Spiaggia.  Word of mouth is spreading that those beloved taco's made \"Nick's Way\" - one grilled crispy corn tortilla and one soft tortilla filled with fresh ingredients like steak, pork, chicken, pinto beans, pico de gallo, Monterey Jack cheese and guacamole - can now be found across town.  They also have a variety of affordable burritos and quesadillas, tortilla soup, elote con queso (white corn brushed with lime salsa and dusted with cotija cheese and cayenne pepper), nachos, chicken wings, chips and salsa, and a grilled corn and black bean taco salad.  Everything is made with local, organic ingredients for under $10, so you get good value for your buck.  No wonder this place has such a loyal following already, especially among neighborhood residents and students. \n\nIf that's not enough, they have free Wi-Fi, frequent events and special deals. On Taco Tuesdays, grab $1 street tacos from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 pm. Thursdays are college night, so with school I.D., get $3 well drinks after 9:00 p.m.  On Saturday, April 18th, they will televise UFC 97 Redemption at 7:00 p.m., $15 cover.

Of course, one can't really compare it to what can be found in the mission but hey, we're talking bout the Sunset here, kinda different demographic. \n\nAll their tacos are bomb. gotta get em nicks way, of course, and in opinion the fish and carne asada are the best. the steak quesadilla is crazy good too, with some kinda flakey and greasy tortilla ive never experienced before. the burritos are solid as well and i havent found too many places that serve a legit California burrito either, (not quite like the ones in SD but pretty damn good).\n\nGood place to watch a game. beer selection is just aight, but nothing to complain about. my buddy did order a whiskey ginger and they put gin in it by accident, maybe the ole Seagrams mistake? dunno.

The tacos are to die for, the drinks are mixed/poured perfectly every time, the staff is friendly without that \"I am better than you\" attitude that WAY too many bartenders and servers have in San Francisco these days.  \n\nThe Place:  The TVs are always on and tuned to a variety of channels, so you never have to be stuck in front of a boring-ass basketball game that just isn't your thing.  The bartenders will also change the channel on request if you're the only one watching or if everyone agrees on the change.  I can almost always find a seat at the bar, and the picnic tables in back are an awesome way to sit with a few strangers and make some new friends.  Doug is doing an awesome job running the place, and it shows in the people he hires, the commitment to quality, and the fair prices rather than gouging his customers.\n\nThe Food:  The fish burrito is delicious and fresh - with crispy cabbage and literally no grease.  The chips are addictive like whoa and the salsas are delish.  The tacos, it goes without saying, are absolutely incredible and in a league of their own in quality and style.  I have tried every version of taco and have never been disappointed in a single bite.  They are so filling that I generally have to stick with the veggie taco just so I'm sure I'll finish it all!  The roasted corn salad is an awesome surprise - huge bowl of fresh goodies, beans, delish corn, and a good helping of fresh fish.  I mean, come on, what bar do you know whose fish of the day is actually edible, nevermind  is salmon or mahi mahi most days??  This menu is not kidding around, and I have witnessed so many people come in JUST to get food - can you name any other bar that is frequented even by those who don't drink?  Last but not least, the elote....oooohhhh the elote....it is SO yummy and melty and tasty - without just being pure grease and fat.  I literally could eat one with every meal.  TRY IT.\n\nThe Drinks:  I've had cosmos, G&Ts, beer, margaritas, sangria, kamikazes, lemon drops, Manhattans, etc. here and every drink has been stellar.  The staff is knowledgeable and always full of suggestions if you're stuck on deciding.  The best part is that even if I have a few drinks, my bill is always reasonable at the end.  Smart on their part, because I can afford to keep coming back!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI may be biased, as you might be able to tell, but I would never in a million years give a review that was not factual and honest!", "author": "Vanessa H."}

On \"1 dollar Margarita night \" they cut you off at 3. The manager is an idiot and obviously has NO idea how to run a business. Because of the extremely rude service I am going to stop coming here every weekend and spending 20 dollars for every 6 people i bring. Good job treating ur customers like crap and talking crap about them 2 feet away becuase they brought straws (which ur employee encouraged us to bring). Giving them 2 less margaritas saves you a lot of money especially when they NEVER come back. My advice to the real manager is to fire that scrub who thinks he knows what hes doing and hire someone who didnt get last in the sf special olympics 100 meter dash (the easiest to win). I told this guy \"your treating us unfairly and losing a lot of business because of your behavior\" and his response was \"have a good night.\" Moral of the story: hire a \"manager\" that wont  drive your bottom line down. Bad business. Its cool if he can count cash at the end of the night and create a work schedule for the employees! You really are horrible at A. Insuring your customers enjoy themselves B. making them want to come back C. Spend money. We had 5 orders of food and 4 drink orders on the way when we ABORTED them because we were DISGUSTED with the service. Sarah is an awesome bartender. We have come many nights and BLEW cash at this place and gave her a fat tip. Never again. Btw I would of given it 5 stars but you really blew it tonight because the food is good and 1 dollar margaritas are a steal. If you want to limit people on how many drinks they have and in turn how many tacos they order thats fine. But that is not how you become an elite establishment. You do it by making your customers enjoy themselves and spreading the word. I will no longer be doing either of those things.  I would LOVE to sit down with the real manager or the owner and let them know what they are doing wrong and what would help them MAKE MORE MONEY. PS I have an MBA from USF and managed an eating establishment for 4 years while i was in school. I doubled their gross revenue and created a system that encouraged repeat customers to recommend peers. Good job alienating a loyal customer and someone who surely helped you thrive.

We took a break for lunch and since it was a beautiful 70 degree day (in SF! in January!) we decided to leave the museum to get our food (plus the cafeteria seems overpriced). After turning on Irving from 19th, we spotted the pizza place across the street, then saw \"Sports Bar & Grill\" and \"Taco Stop\". We decided to go with Underdog's. I had a delicious cold Blue Moon beer that really hit the spot after being in the sun. For lunch, I ordered the veggie taco and the grilled fish taco. They brought out chips covered with what looked like homemade salsa. The chips were nice and crunchy and the salsa was good, so we quickly devoured them. The tacos themselves were big - the tortillas are probably regular-sized corn tortillas, but they are overstuffed and wrapped in paper so they don't fall apart. I went for the veggie taco first, which had a generous amount of guacamole smooshed on top. It was made Nick's way (one tortilla is crispy fried, the other is soft) and so good. The fish taco was also really good, but surprising spicy. It made me sweat, but luckily the beer and lots of water helped. My lunchmates all enjoyed their food and beverages. The bartenders were all very friendly and helpful too. What a lucky find. I'm psyched to have found a great place to grab a bite within walking distance of GG Park.\n\nSemi-update: We went back 2 days later because I was obsessing about their salsa and veg tacos.

The bartender even told me how much it was going to be and then charged me a different price. I am usually more careful about looking at the bill before signing it, but I was just so excited that the Giants won. So I called the next morning to speak with one of the servers and he said he saw that I was overcharged and would relay the information to his boss. I gave them two days and didn't hear anything back from them and called again. Again the same response was I do not have the authority to take care of this matter and he said he would talk to his partner about it. No call back, so I call again and they have my number in the system as well as my order number. Finally after like a week of hassle I get a call back that I can get my refund.

Thank goodness for my sister, my go to person for good eats in the city.  She recommended Nick's Crispy Tacos but informed me that they served it here at Underdogs, and added to be sure to ask for it \"Nick's way.\"  While different from what we previously had, it definitely was good!  The guy my bf ordered from suggested to eat it with their sauce (a sort of mildly spicy salsa) and he was right!  The fish is a pretty good size (covered in batter and deep fried) wrapped with both crunchy and soft tortillas, topped with a generous amount of guacamole.  One is good for a snack, but two could be good enough for a meal.  It's $5, but worth it.  I would come back for more!

More details later...\n\n...details:  \n\n1)  We waiting at least 10 minutes to get service, and finally had to ask for our server from the bartender.\n2)  We eventually got cokes/diet cokes.  They brought us approximately a thimble full, and then never came back to refill it...not one single time during the hour+ that we were there.\n3)  I ordered a fish burrito (maybe not my best order ever, but I was hungover and craving it), and the BF ordered beef and fish tacos.  THIRTY minutes later, chips and salsa done and no drink refill in sight, we still don't have our burrito/tacos.  How long does it take to throw some ingredients in a tortilla, peeps?  Finally, we ask the bartender (again) where our food is.\n4)  Magically, our food arrives 2 minutes later.  Starving, we immediately dig in.  My burrito is dis-gus-ting.  Not only is it a shrimp (not fish) burrito (and shrimp are beyond terrible in a burrito, methinks), but it is completely soggy and mushy...like it's been sitting on a counter, wrapped in foil, for the past 30 minutes.  Maybe cause it had been?  And the tacos were tres tres TRES mediocre.\n5)  After picking through my burritomush, I give up and we try to leave...but guess what?  We can't find our server!!!

Fortunately for me, my class was canceled, which left my night open for TNT doubleheader.  Only problem: no one was free to go.  However, my buddy Timmon, being the big basketball fan he is, found it very hard to pass it up.  So we left it up to fate: Heads = class, Tails = Underdog's.  Underdog's won, but his girlfriend seemed kind of mad at me for putting the idea in his head since he should've been going to class.  So since this decision got us on her bad side, we figured this bar better be pretty damn awesome.\n\nThis bar really didn't disappoint.  We were able to find a table against the wall right in front of one of the TV's so we had a perfect view.  We pick up the menus and one of the female bartenders was nice enough to come over and say hi even though we weren't in her area.  I wasn't really planning on eating since I was supposed to meet up with some friends later to eat, but I couldn't resist getting some street tacos.  Man those were pretty damn good.  My friend Marc had a carne asada burrito and looked like he was in heaven.  I think I gotta try theirs next time.\n\nIt's like no sports bar is complete without the basketball arcade game.

I love the picnic table seating in the back and the friendly service. Not a huge sports fan, but I can get into it sometimes, and it's a cool place to catch a game. Only qualm is the lack of seating and wait when it's really busy, so it's best to go on the off hours or arrive early if you wanna catch a big game. Ok, one other small qualm is the somewhat confusing / slightly inconsistent service. It seems that the waitresses all sort of pitch in and you might get served by like three different people. Not a huge deal. I've met Nick, the owner, and he's a really chill, down-to-earth, nice guy who obviously knows how to make a kick-ass taco.

The baja fish tacos served Nick's way are outstanding and unrivaled in the city.  The margaritas are well done and unpretentious (cuz you all know that margs these days can be a little too precious sometimes).  Finally, the service is quick, on point and solicitous. I like the fact that the bartenders and servers are aware that you need your messy napkins taken away and always want to ply you with more.  It's the perfect symbiotic relationship of patron and server--they make more money when your drink is always full and you are a happy camper.  Why can't more establishments train their staff to be so aware?

The food was decent enough (and they are close enough) for me to go back again.\n\nI waddled in today craving a sandwich but not feeling like the walk up to Andronico's. I'd read so many glowing (glowing!) reviews here on Yelp that I figured I'd be remiss to not check out a place so close to my abode. \nWanting something to-go that was easy to eat, I ordered the pollo burrito con todo (but said \"Chicken. With everything.\" Because I'm white and nerdy and have a major self-conscious issue going on with \nforeign words).\nSince I ordered to-go, I can't really make any comments about the dine-in experience or the ambiance of the place. It looked clean, smelled like good food (and limes and beer, but not too much beer).\n. \nThe burrito had to sit in the foil until I got home (about 20 minutes) and by the time I unwrapped it, it was a little on the wet side. Everything tasted fresh, I sampled the two salsas (green and red) that came with, but didn't love either one (or the heartburn they were pretty much guaranteed to inflict - hi, pregnant lady here). I actually liked the beans best...they weren't too mushy or salty, and they definitely weren't bland. The chicken was okay, but it seemed like it was lacking something...zing? I was kind of hoping for a more grilled or blackened chicken breast, instead I'm pretty sure it was breast/thigh combination that seemed to be slow cooked with some kind of sauce. It definitely wasn't dry which is a huge plus, but again, it needs something. \nOverall, it was yummy, but I have a feeling that without the guac, sour cream and cheese, the taste would have been underwhelming. And it would have been nice to have the sour cream and cheese throughout the whole burrito...the sour cream seemed to be all crammed into one end, and the cheese at the other.\n\nSlightly underwhelmed, but I'll be back, because there were people at the bar eating crispy-looking tacos that looked super yummy and I want to try them. And seriously, so many good reviews? You people can't all be wrong. :) Next time I'll try the baja pescado tacos I think.", "author": "Christine G."}

This being the closest thing to a sportsbar anywhere near the 19th and Lincoln area; it quickly became my home away from home. \n\nWhen I first began stopping by, it was middle school cafateria-esque. Very bland and lacking character. But, it had flat screen TV's aplenty and any sport game on any sport package you could ask for. Menu - standart bar food with a few Hawaiian inspired dishes.  Food - bland and below average. Service - average to slightly above. Setting: way below avg for a sportsbar.Staff - good. \n\nFast forward to today (9/13/08): They've done a lot (understatement) to improve the place. Painted some walls. Changed the chairs/stools. Added memorabilia. To sum it up - they've given it life. Oh, and the menu? Completely redone as of 2 weeks ago. The menu has been redone by Nick of \"Nick's Crispy Tacos\" - of the Russian Hill fame - and it is quite an improvement. Loving Mexican food (and previous living in So Cal) there is not an up-to-par Mexican food joint anywhere near this area. \n\nThe chips? As the guy siting on the barstool next to me said, \"kinda thick, but fresh and very crispy with a great pico.\" And coming from a hispanic guy who lives and works in the Mission, I'll uphold his seal of approval. \n\nThe tacos? Had 1 carne asada and one of the batter fried fish. The only complaint I could offer is that there was a too much white sauce on the fish taco. Both were big and falling out of their shells (for ~$4/each - they should be). The fish batter was light, crispy, and non overpowering. The steak was nicely cooked and full of flavor. Plenty of guac and pico topping. Very delightful - both. \n\nThe quesadilla is unlike any I've ever had, in a great way. Filled with your choice of meat, pico, and cheese, the tortilla is fried after stuffed w/fillings. Comes out flaky, crispy, hot, and only slightly greasy. Definately worth experiencing for yourself.\n\nWhat could be improved: the buffalo/hot wings! Have had them many times over the years (favorite bar food) and they haven't changed: small and typically dry. Only offered with ranch - no blue cheese. Sauce is...ehh. But it is a Mexican-inspired sports bar. May be too much asking for great wings. \n\nA good place that keeps getting better. If you're in the area, give it a try. See you there.

I'm talking like probably three times a week, on average. You will rarely find me in a mood where I will turn down a taco (or a margarita for that matter). I did not know this place existed. I had been to the Nick's in the Polk Gulch a few times and naturally, I was a fan. My buddy who lives in the sunset posted something about tacos and beer in the sunset on her facebook and I was intrigued. Five minutes of research later the lady and I were on our bikes, heading into the fog. We got there and scored two seats at the bar. Important detail: It was a Friday at 5:30. We ordered some chips and salsa, the street tacos (hells yes, a variety platter of tacos, we decided we would pick our favorite and order it seperately, nicks way, see other reviews for details) We then ordered two margaritas. The bartender looked at his watch and said, oh, do you want to wait 5 minutes til they are a dollar? My red headed lady and I quickly made meaningful eye contact. Could it be, did he actually say what we think he just said? Yes. The margaritas are only one dollar between 6 and 6:30 on Fridays. And they make huge amounts and continue refilling as long as you are still standing. I think I had about 6? Maybe 8? Anyway. The tacos were delicious. We picked the carnitas to have Nicks way (it was moist and spicy) and ordered it at approximately 5:25. We think the bartender might have been enjoying some of the margaritas as well, because we had to ask about our taco about 45 minutes after we ordered it. He said he had put the order in, but we suspected he just didn't want to fess up. Anyway, it came about an hour after we ordered it, hence the missing star.

If you've lived in the city for any extended period of time, you've been to Nick's Crispy Tacos on Polk. You know that tacos Nick's Way can cure everything from hunger pangs to hangovers! This place takes all the great food and finally puts it in the ambiance of a sports bar. The prices are great for the amount of food you get. The differences from the original on Polk are noticeable as beer is actually on tap and you don't have to sit in those nasty sticky booths of Rouge that from what I can tell were made of red velvet at some point?! The $1 street tacos are a great deal and the service is very good, phenomenal actually when you actually get Nick himself taking care of you, of which I've had the honor on several occasions. Parking is a problem, especially for lunch and on weekends but the N Judah drops you off about a block away if that. I moved to Marin a while back and this is one of the few places along 19th worth stopping at.", "author": "Ryan M."}

This place is relatively new to the area  and I think would've gone under if not for the addition of Nicks Crispy Tacos.  This and only this is the reason to stop by. The tacos are probably the best you're gonna find this side of the Mission and they've got some decent drink specials if you show up at the right time. The atmosphere is what you'd expect (save for the fact that they allow kids in the place) out of a \"sports\" bar. I was on the cusp of giving it 4 stars, but ehh, the tacos could be a little cheaper and with so many other bars in the city, I would hardly call this a destination spot. Maybe a pre-party on the way downtown or a I can't afford a big screen t.v.and I'm hungry for a taco spot.", "author": "Sean H."}

Just right off the N-Judah. I've  gone three times since the move. The veggie taco is $3.50 and all the meat style tacos are $4.50. The carnitas taco had really tender meat. The way it's supposed to taste. For a $1.50 you can order the chips and salsa and there is a huge portion of pico de gallo. (spelling?) $2.50 Dos Equis on tap or in the bottle. The corn elote con queso was not exactly how it's usually made. Too much cotija cheese and not enough chili powder. I wiped most of the mild cheese off leaving more room for fresh lime juice. Elote is usually bar-b-qued as well. I understand it is an indoor facility though. I would say go early if your going on a game day. The bartender said it's  mayhem on big sports game days!  I'm glad Nick and the owner are friends because prior to Nick's, it was just another asian bar in the sunset. Nick, you may have very well saved their ass! I know, I have recently become a regular. I never would have gone back after the first time going to just the bar. It's so much more welcoming and inviting since the remodel.   Good job guys! You made a new fan!", "author": "monika l."}

My drink came about ten to fifteen minutes after the rest of the group. To make matters worse the drink seemed pretty weak.  When I order a cadillac margarita I want something that taste like booze of quality, this tasted like mixer.  I swear the bartender forgot the Gran Mariner on the first round.  Tacos were alright but not worth the price. It seems like some people enjoy the place, however when the crowd came in, things really looked like they were falling apart.", "author": "Max R."}

Hopefully it's helpful.\n\nMy friends and I went to underdogs to watch the big game of the week in college football.  We've been there before for drinks in the evening, but this was our first time visiting during the afternoon.  After reading some the reviews, we thought this would be good place to catch a game.  Unfortunately, we were extremely mistaken.  When we walked into the back, 3 of the 4 TV's were on the game of the week, but only one had the sound on.  The third was on a different game.  My friends and I asked if the sound could be turned on on other TV's as well, but after telling us they'd try the waitress came back 30 mins. later saying that they were going to turn off the sound all the TV's and put subtitles on because it's policy not to have sound unless it's a Michigan game.  They also said they'd send the manager if we wanted to argue their policy.  Fortunately,  I guess they simply forgot because the subtitles were never turned on, the manager was not sent, and the sound on the one tv that had it  was never turned off the one tv.  Later we were told that they didn't want it to get noisy when 3-4 different games were on, but at the time there was only one game on the TV's in the back and the only other sound was the music they were piping in.\n\nThey also changed the game in the middle of the 3rd quarter on all the TV's to an \"unsubscribed channel.\"  It took them 10 mins of loud complaining by approximately 30 people before the realized they should turn it back to the original football game.  But seriously, who turns it to an \"unsubscribed channel\" in the middle of a football game and leaves it there?  Also, the drinks were like water.  My rum and coke actually tasted more like melted ice + coke than anything else.  \n\nFood was OK, except the carne asada in the nachos were dry and tough in some parts.  The wings were good enough that we were going to get a second plate until all the back and forth with the sound being off and the TV being changed to a blank channel.\n\nThe waitresses were nice and attentive even though one of them spilled a water on me without noticing.", "author": "Alexander C."}

It was the best random decision we have ever made! The atmosphere was instantly pleasing. The bar was very inviting and we sat at one of the picnic style tables in the back. There are huge flat screen TV's on each wall playing 3 or 4 different games. We ordered the Mexican \"Street Style\" tacos (one each of carne asada, chicken, and carnitas), a Baja Style battered fish taco, and the carne asada taco \"Nick's Way\". We also got the chips and salsa. Everything was so delicious we left feeling 100% satisfied with everything we had. My only complaint is that the chips were so damn good that I couldn't stop eating them and had to have my carne asada taco later that night because I was too full to finish. Josh was the bartender at the time and he was really helpful and in a great mood. We also had the pleasure of meeting Nick himself who was eager to make sure that we were happy. We've been in to The Taco Shop about 6 times since that Monday afternoon and it has only been about a month. Needless to say we will be back over and over again.", "author": "Stephanie M."}
