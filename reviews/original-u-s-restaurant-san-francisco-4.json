Their walls are plastered with gorgeous murals, canvas pieces, greenery, etc. They have a bright red Vespa that permanently sits on display in one corner (which we ended up using as a photo prop). There were plenty of smaller tables on the sides for us to set up welcome/photo booths and store coats/purses.\n\nSecond of all, communication with Mario leading up to the event was seamless, whether it was discussing the menu, prices, or decorations. He was responsive, flexible, and made sure to loop in his other staff to our email thread when he was on vacation. Figuring out a family-style menu with him was a breeze - an assortment of salads and pizzas and mini cannoli for dessert, with coffee/tea on the side. \n\nService was spectacular and NOT overwhelming, and Mario made sure we had buffer time before and after the event to decorate and clean up. In fact, our event went over by a few HOURS, and all they told us was to just have fun because they didn't book any parties after us. (Though I felt bad and ordered a couple of snack dishes for the guests to munch on.)\n\nI'm writing this review months later, and I'm still shocked at what a great match this was.

I walked from the financial district to North Beach in search of some seafood pasta and the place I decided on had a line out the door, so I decided to walk around the neighborhood and see what else I could find. I walked by this place and there was a couple of open tables so I decided to pop-in; after looking at the photos on Yelp of course. Since I was a party of 1 I sat at the bar and watched the Diamondbacks and Giants game. After looking at the menu and being torn between two dishes - polpette and trapanese - I asked my server for a recommendation and without hesitation he said the trapanese with house-made sausage. I was sold. Bread and cannellini beans arrived at the same time as my meal. The pasta dish was out of this world. I don't think I have ever had an Italian meal this satisfying or complex. The pasta was cooked to my liking, the tomato and basil pesto sauce was light and not sweet, and the toasted almonds gave the dish just enough texture without it being out of place. The sausage had a good spice level to it. I walked out of there without feeling like I had gluten gut. Good atmosphere, great staff, amazing food. A+ in my book and I will be back in the near future.", "author": "John C."}

I was not sure what to expect, but overall I found that there are a few gems at this restaurant that may be worth ordering over others.\n\nThe Good:\n- Trapanese Pizza (fresh tomato, mozzarella and Sicilian sausage) \nDelicious! My friends and I were probably not expecting much, so this was a pleasant surprise.  I loved the spice to the Sicilian sausage, and the light tomato sauce was smooth.\n- Gnocchi with pesto \nOK, it is not on the menu, but I was delighted that they were flexible in arranging for this! Their pesto sauce is not creamy, but rather just your typical oily pesto.  Their gnocchi are fluffy and light, as they should be.\n- Melanzana Parmigiana (fried eggplant with tomato sauce and mozzarella) \nMy friends ordered this to share, and I got to sneak a piece. Great flavors, and I especially appreciate that they know how to make tomato sauce that is not overpowering or too rich.\n\nWouldn't order again:\n- Gnocchi al Pistacchio (homemade dumplings in pistachio cream sauce)\nSo, this sounded exciting and delicious, but it just did not do it for us.  It was a bit bland.  If you are going to order gnocchi, ask for the other options.\n\nWe also had their tiramisu and we loved it!

Like another Yelper said, the portions here are large, so don't fill up on the bread!\n\nGot a cup if minestrone soup which was the soup of the day, and it was delicious, the soup was homemade and rich with long-cooked soup flavor and vegetables, I'm going to have to order this every time I come here and a cup is just enough.  Ask for a sprinkling of parmesan cheese, makes all the difference in the world.\n\nGot the Melanzana Siciliana, fried eggplant appetizer, (fried, breaded eggplant sticks with a cup of tangy tomato sauce).  The eggplant sticks were amazingly light, but permeated with the taste of fry oil, so next time I'd skip this to save room for the hearty entrees.\n\nTasted the Spaghetti Pesto Trapanese with homemade sausage and slivered almonds.  The sausage, though flavorful with a hint of fennel, was too salty for me, but my friend, who is Sicilian, says it's just like his Grandma made it.\n\nI ordered Linguine Porticello, pasta with scallops, shrimp in a tomato sauce with sliced black olives and capers & I loved this.  The seafood was very fresh, I just could not stop eating this!

Per an untitled Yelp picture, I thought it would be the white cake with cream and candied orange & lemon slices on top, but it was a sliver of ice cream cake with pistachios on top, (which to me in the Yelp picture looked like a cheesecake).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-12", "description": "Sometimes you feel like an old-timey Italian dinner in North Beach, probably when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie. The old location was an institution I never patronized even though I had heard it was one of Robin Williams' hang-outs when he was a struggling stand-up. If I wanted something with a red sauce when I was younger, I'd have gone to Gold Spike or Capp's Corner for spaghetti and meatballs and minestrone, but those places have bit the dust. It was with some unintended expectation that the newly renovated Original US Restauant would bring back some of that old-timey feeling courtesy of an Alioto, Mario this time. It did but not necessarily in a memorable way for me and Jamie W.\n\nWe came early on a Saturday night, around 6PM when there was only a family of four eating next to the window. There was certainly plenty of staff getting ready for the dinner rush which did start to trickle in as soon as we sat down. I looked at the vintage photo on the wall of what looked to be a swimming club (photo: http://bit.ly/1PQImtp), and it turned out to be part of \"Unione Sportiva\", a league of local Italian-American athletic clubs over a century ago. That's where the \"U.S.\" in the name came from, which was news to me since I thought it was a patriotic moniker. We started with the $12 U.S. Caprese, which seemed overpriced for four thin slices of not quite ripe tomatoes with not quite fresh mozzarella slices on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1SLj2Yv).\n\nThis classic salad was accompanied by the hard-crust Italian bread that came with cannellini beans, the most interesting touch of the evening as the beans made for an effective spread (photo: http://bit.ly/1PQI2uC). Jamie ordered the $19 Spaghetti alla Puttanesca, which made mention of a tomato sauce but appeared devoid of it. The pasta was accounted for as were the capers and olives. The anchovies were more than present as they lent an unwelcome fishy flavor to the dish that no amount of grated Parmesan cheese could hide (photo: http://bit.ly/1o5j0Nu). I went for one of their daily specials on a Saturday evening, the $21 Osso Bucco with Risotto (photo: http://bit.ly/1Xn6Fk5).\n\nIt just missed the mark as the veal shanks were hefty but not quite tender enough with the risotto somewhat overcooked as it was on the mushy side versus al dente. We decided to share a specialty dessert since we were, after all, in the heart of North Beach, the $8 slice of Cassata Siciliana. I didn't know what it would be, but the name sounded like an opera. It came out as a slice of sponge cake moistened with some kind of liqueur and layered with a slightly frozen ricotta cheese. It had a very sweet vanilla filling, and it was encased in marzipan and decorated with the type of candied fruit you would expect in a fruitcake (photo: http://bit.ly/1TcfkFu). Should have went for the spumoni.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...old-timey Italian with no frills but not so satisfying\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a big place by North Beach standards\nSERVICE - 3 stars...nice enough but a little bit on automatic pilot as they wait for the big parties to come in\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a middling return for a North Beach institution...maybe that was the expectation?", "author": "Ed U."}

Those 3 clubs were combined into one in 1936...the SF Italian Athletic Club that we know today (and located a couple of blocks away on Stockton).\n\nFor me, it's all about the meatballs or the chicken parmesan.

Not tasty at all.  And, no butter as an option.  My clams and garlic were boring. They needed A LOT MORE seasoning...garlic for sure and parsley.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-28", "description": "For my birthday earlier this summer, a friend asked me to pick a dinner place.\nAnother friend who remembers eating at places like these in North Beach in the good old days... Little Joe's, Caffe Sport, New Pisa, Caesar's, etc.\nMy memories of U.S. Restaurant are from their 'original' location at the triangle corner of Columbus, Stockton, and Green Street now occupied by Panatrei Restaurant.  It was one of my regular Friday lunch and dinner rotation spot as they served daily special entrees and soup.  The Friday soup was Manhattan clam chowder, served in a large hearty bowl with chunks of clam pieces.  My entr\u00e9e was a half/half order of their petrale sole and fried calamari with rigatoni.  Served with locally baked bread, this meal usually yielded another half meal for me; I'd sop the remaining sauce from the rigatoni with the bread because, yes, it was that good.\nBack to the present, U.S. Restaurant closed here and then reopened a few blocks away on Columbus across from Rose Pistola.  Dining there once on their counter, in looking at the menu and after dining there, it just wasn't the same.  \nFast forward about eight years later, we came here on a Wednesday night.  After a quick scan of the menu, here's what we tried:\n\nAppetizer\n1) Steamed mussels (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PsY0mu07NvE84nBUYNdaLg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Nothing memorable other than a.  Mussel shells all opened except two, b.  Toasts made for great dipping for the wine broth, and c.  Portions were decent.\n\nPasta\n2) Tortellini carbonara (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vLPbJm8VLCeJXo1WQbDKDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - If you are a cheese and cream sauce lover, you'll enjoy this one.  The peas and ham offered a nice change from the other two dominant flavors.\n\nPizza\n3) Quattro Stagioni (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_YlIhOdiZRZ9MpIovoTpTw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Very colorful with the ham, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms.  The crust was neither thick nor thin and the ingredients were good, but there wasn't much flavor sauce wise.\n\nWe were one of four or five occupied tables and our waiter was very friendly and enthusiastic (loved the Italian accent).  Besides the above, we were given a cup of bean salad, a vinegary mix of garbanzo, lima, and green beans which opened up our palates for the meal.  I spread some on my bread which quieted my hunger pangs as they prepared our meal.  I asked my host to pick two of the three dishes while I selected the pizza.  Everything was okay, probably a 3.5 in my book, touch better than just okay, for what we ordered.  Would have considered the short ribs, but didn't know whether my host was big on meats.  We had a bit of pasta and almost half of the pizza to take home, which I brought for my family for the next day.  They enjoyed the change of pace from our neighborhood pie place.  \nHard to review a place when expectations and memories are factors judging the experience.

I don't like the idea of leaving bad reviews, which is the kind most people are going to use their time to post, and a negative review has never deterred me from going to a business. But... I had a less than ideal time here on 6/17/17... So here goes. Firstly, I wanted to order an apertif. When at an Italian/Sicilian restaurant, I like to follow the customs- they only serve beer and wine- so no apertif and digestif for me- only had water. Next. The bread came. It was not good. My wife was a pro pastry chef and she suspects that the bread isn't made in-house and didn't have more than a bite, it didn't taste fresh. I am going to Sicily for the first time in August and my family is Sicilian, so I have been researching a lot of things in preparation for my trip and was anxious to try arancine for the first time. My dad makes panelle, so didn't need to try that. Even though I had never eaten arancine before, I was not impressed. Their taste did not excite me. My wife said she had arancine someplace else and that it was, \"way better\". Next, insalata, the U.S. Salad was actually good!!! Next, the main course. I had the 'Spaghetti Pesto Trapanese' It was okay. It was a light tomato sauce with some basil leaves and almond slices thrown in. But I was expecting 'green' pasta, a thick pesto sauce, if you know what I mean, but the entree was acceptable. Not sure how a few small basil leaves thrown in qualifies the dish as being \"pesto\". I ate about half. My wife's plate on the other hand... she got the 'Gnocchi al Pistacchio' (homemade dumplings in pistachio cream sauce). What the hell? It was weird. It was terrible. The gnocci itself would melt in your mouth, there was nothing to chew, it was nuked (if this is Sicilian style, well, I'll find that out in 40 days). Imagine a pistachio cream sauce, what that might be. The sauce the gnocci were in was described by my wife as \"just cream and butter\". There was no flavor whatsoever to the dish- she tried adding salt. It was gross. No hint of pistacchio. She only ate maybe 1/4 of her food. Based on our experience so far, we did not order dessert, nor coffee. We got the hell out of there and went across the street and I ordered an expresso and fernet distigif whilst my wife ordered an affogato. I tried this place out, happy to visit an old institution (I miss Caesars). But I will be checking out other Italian restaurants in North Beach and will not be returning.", "author": "Barra K."}

My wife and I decided to go to North Beach for dinner and started walking up Columbus Ave. We passed this place, very unassuming look compared with the nearby places. We saw people going in and saw the Yelp emblem. Did a quick check, saw the favorable reviews and decided to give it a try. Really glad we did. It was a Saturday evening and the place was crowded, but we were offered a table for two near the door and took it. We were immediately pleased by the ambiance. Lots of people, including two large parties, and everyone having a good time. Seems like there were a number of regulars who were greeted like family. By the time we left we felt like family.\nWhat impressed us about the food was its simple, clean, \"straight ahead\" flavors. The Pastina in brodo had just the right chicken stock flavor. The Carpaccio di Polipo was delightful - octopus sliced razor thin, almost melt in your mouth, marinated perfectly in olive oil and lemon. I had the Spaghetti Pesto Trapenese with housemade sausage and my wife had the Linguine Pescatora in white wine sauce. Both were \"Trinacria: authentic Sicilian dishes and both were amazing. The Spaghetti was flavorful itself and the pesto was strips of basil - not the heavy pesto sauce I was afraid of. The flavors were simple and subtle. The Linguine dish was an abundance of seafood perfectly cooked, with the white wine base that was not overstated. I had the cannoli for desert - again simple was best; no chocolate chips or lemon peel or candied fruit. \nThe service was superb. In spite of it being a busy, crowded evening, we never felt neglected. Our waiter was attentive, gracious, knowledgeable. \nThis was a great discovery! We cannot wait to return!", "author": "James A."}

The service was amazing and the staff was very welcoming. If you are looking for that Sicilian home cooked experience this is the place to go! The food is delicious and so fresh! Make sure to order wine because they have a great selection and the bartender is adorable. This family operated restaurant is wonderful and I recommend everyone go and check it out!", "author": "Gabby L."}

Place makes the Olive Garden look good. While I was eating a deranged street person kept wandering in off the street bothering the few dinners. Reaction of the wait staff was nothing. They didn't even ask this person to leave. In fact wait staff was MIA nearly all the time. Penne pasta---they didn't even try. Frankly I am not going to waste a lot of time detailing the many faults of this dive. Suffice it to say there is a lot better in North Beach and I would not even recommend this as a fallback---starving would be a better option. Truly worthless. P.s. I find some of the glowing reviews posted here to be suspicious either that or the posters have been living in a cave for last 20 years.", "author": "Bill B."}

Highly recommend the \"Salami\" di Polipo (marinated octopus) as a starter -- you won't believe how good it tastes & how appealing they make it look. The Mozzarella cheese sticks & Bruschetta were also good. Ravioli Bolognese, Ravioli Porcini, & Veal Piccata were all excellent main dishes. Extensive menu with choices for every taste (seafood, chicken, meat, pasta) with a wide selection of Italian wines (try the Rosso Piceno for a great glass of red). Nice ambiance, but service was slow & spotty through-out. It was early on a Sat night, before the big dinner crowds. Water refills came just at the end of the meals, one of the side dishes was wrong, the waiter didn't check on us once the food came, and we had to really flag him down to get our bill. The food was good, the real thing, & the place is worth checking out. Service was disappointing though & we'll probably stick to our other favorites in North Beach when we go back.", "author": "HJ B."}

The food was excellent, the menu had a wide selection, the prices were reasonable, and it had a nice family atmosphere.  We tried the calamari and mussels as appetizers.  They were some of the best mussels I have had in years.  For entrees the Chicken Parmigiana and the Seafood Pasta were excellent.  We highly recommend the Original US Restaurant, we definitely will go back.", "author": "John C."}

As an Italian-American from San Francisco who grew up in North Beach, I can honestly say that the food was excellent. I ate what I always ordered at the US - breaded veal cutlet. Perfect! I had a cup of pastina - also perfect. Salad excellent - fresh, delicious.  The waiter brings this nice little dish of Ceci beans and I think chopped onion - wow that was fabulous. I was going to ask for olive oil but I stuck with the Ceci. The house wine was perfect - $24 I believe, and it was nice. Now for dessert, I had this ricotta cake. I do not remember the name, but I love cannoli and this beats cannoli a for sure. Of course I will always miss the original location but my experience was wonderful and it is very nostalgic. I will be a frequent diner. It's worth it!", "author": "Stephen B."}

Tasted like they had thawed it in the microwave.  The sauce was fine.  I have never sent back a meal in my life, but I thought about it.  My husband ordered pasta and it was ok.  I will never to back to this restaurant.", "author": "Janice P."}

I got the chicken parm and it was probably the best I've ever had. Service was wonderful. Our waiter was very sweet. Only issue was, our table was in an awkward spot so we felt like we were in everyone's way. Great wine menu as well!

They forgot to give a pizza as part of a delivery of 3 items!?!  After waiting 20 minutes they said that it's their policy not to redeliver the pizza.  Sorry. So I pay the delivery service and tip but don't get my meal.  On top of it the fries were undercooked and cold and they provided no ketchup nor napkins.  Never again will I order from here and I recommend nobody does.  Customer service is not part of their vocabulary. Thanks for nothing", "author": "Gregg P."}

The omelet was overcooked, the fries were undercooked, flabby and greasy.  The only good thing about the meal was the dish of canellini beans.  The service was slow.  I had to constantly wave my arms to get the waiter's attention.  I'm Italian and also grew up in San Francisco.  Lunch was a huge disappointment.

Waiter offered cheese and then put in so much that I had cheese soup and could nott eat it.. Egg plant was greasy and floating in sauce rather than fried and resting on sauce, so wound up not eating more than a bite.  Companions had linguini in seafood sauce, Seafood was decent but linguini was far too al dente.  Wound up taking two mains home, perhaps they would taste better next day, but they were packed in kitchen and packages leaked , so wound up with soggy mess to be thrown away.  There are far better places in North Beach", "author": "ira l."}
