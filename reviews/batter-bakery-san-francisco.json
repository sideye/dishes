The kiosk on California St. really only allows one customer to browse and buy at a time, but there wasn't a line when I went (before the lunch rush), so all was fine. The staff member was really nice, friendly, and helpful. I mentioned that it was my first time  there and she recommended the scones and the sand angel cookies, so I got one of each, along with a piece of banana bread. \n\nI got back to the office and taste tested each of them. They were SO good. I'm used to eating cookies that are overloaded with sugar to the point that I'll put them down and never pick them up again, but that wasn't the case here. The sand angel was sweet but had a depth of flavor--a combination of gingerbread and snickerdoodle and jus some yummy goodness. It was packed with flavor, so I didn't eat it in one sitting, but I went back to it throughout the afternoon. \n\nThe brown butter banana bread was the same way. It was perfectly sweet, moist, and flavorful. I could taste actual fresh ingredients, which made all the difference. \n\nThe pear scone was tasty, moist, and fluffier than store-bought ones, which I appreciated.  I can't wait to try more. \n\nAlso, don't forget to ask for a punch card. Once you purchase 12 items, you get one free!", "author": "Lori C."}

However, in this situation, I am guilty.  A name as beautiful as \"Sand Angel\" which I originally thought was \"Angel dust\" I predicted was going to be a magical and enchanted, life-changing cookie.  Oh, but what's in a name?\n\nI have passed this glass time-capsule looking kiosk for weeks but never knew what contains inside.  I've avoided walking by too close, for fear of solicitation of a product that is useless to me but would be easily convinced to buy.  I am an ultimate consumer after all, in the process of converting to more minimalist ways.  Over time, curiosity got the best of me, and I've walked closer and closer to the time capsule each day.  What's inside? Ooh, it's a snack booth? Ha. of course I would first think about food.  Knick-knacks? Something expensive?  A teeth whitening kiosk? Timeshare?  NO, it's baked goods! I already knew that because YELP pointed me towards the direction of a bakery closest to the Starbucks.  \n\nSo, the Sand Angel- I expected to find a sugar cookie as fine and smooth as white sand that crumbles as it is delicate in its cookie molded form.  But no, it was a chunky brown cookie lightly dusted with powdered sugar that taste of oatmeal and spice.  However, there were no oats found; Perhaps they use finely grounded rolled oats?  Not sure, but it sure is good!  Probably my favorite non-chocolate cookie ever.  Call me an old lady,  but I do love me a good oatmeal cookie tho.  Still unsure what is in a Sand Angel but I find them addicting as I've come here twice for them already.\n\nI've tasted the chocolate chip cookie, and I can do without them next time.  There are a lot of other things to try from Batter Bakery and may try them some time. For now, I come here for one thing and one thing only.", "author": "Leslie G."}

I read that the sand angel cookies (their most popular one) sometimes run out, so I called and asked the girl working the kiosk if there were any. She said yes and said she'd hold some for me! I literally work upstairs from the kiosk, so I zoomed my way down there.\n\nGoodies I got:\n\nSand angel: I know everyone raved about this but I just didn't quite understand. To be fair, I was a bit under the weather the first time I tried it, but after I got better, I tried it again. I loved the chewy texture, but the flavor just reminded me of the Mother's brand oatmeal cookies, which I really like, but aren't OMG. I will say it's hard to stop eating though.\n\nLavender shortbread: LOL I'm always reminded of my aunt's many lavender-scented pillows when I smell lavender, so my sister said eating this made her feel like she was inhaling a pillow. But, fair comment, as the lavender aroma on this is SUPER strong.\n\nThe other things I got: chocolate chip cookie, chocolate mint cookie, gingerbread men (supah cute!).\n\nPeanut butter cookies: Also perfect, doughy cookie texture, but the reese's cup in the middle wasn't lodged in super tight on some of these.\n\nCarrot cake: moist, tiny coconut pieces, frosting is soft and medium light. \n\nChocolate chip: Pretty standard, but I like the crunchiness of it combined with the chewiness. Could be a tad more chewy though.\n\nTo be 100% fair, probably a 3.5 based on food and lack of bags, but the kind service I got at the kiosk (the girl working was super nice and easy to talk to!) and convenience really make it a 4.\n\nActually, if anyone has any food only found in SF that they think would make great gifts for friends and family in other cities and countries, hit me up! I'd love to get your thoughts. I had an extensive list for NYC goodies (Doughnut Plant, Dominique Ansel's cronut, Junior's cheesecake, Levain's chocolate chip cookies, Magnolia's cupcakes and banana pudding) but I just can't think of any here.

My golly! \n\nThe worst possible question you could ask a frazzled lady in a kiosk is, \"What do you recommend?\" And that's what I'd asked. hahaha I wanted to see more of what they had and wanted to try something new, but of course not all the items were put out yet. =\\\n\nIf it's your first visit, I'd recommend NOT coming right when they open.

At the next cookie craving opportunity, I stopped by, randomly choosing a Sand Angel. Instant convert! My fave is the ginger cherry but there are several close 2nds.

It's thick in the middle, and really soft and chewy, just the way I like my cookies. It has great flavor, with cinnamon, ginger, molasses and other kinds of spices.

I highly recommend it!\n\nI've never been a huge fan of shortbread - as I said, I like my cookies chewy and soft, but others have raved about the shortbread here, so I thought I would give it a try. The lavender sea salt shortbread was pretty good and the bits of salt added a really unique flavor. I didn't taste the lavender as much, it was subtle. \n\nAt $2.75/cookie, it is a bit pricey and probably not something I would get regularly.

I had such a hard time deciding between brownie vs. cookie vs. cupcake. But in the end, the cupcakes ($3 each) won out.

Knowing me and my sweet tooth, I had to check out Batter Bakery as soon as I discovered it. You really can't miss it on the corner of Kearny and California (the address isn't accurate) since it's an awesome little round, glass kiosk. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fLL5hu-3oRKZdZjEv3J5Gg?select=aWo8fg7sR7gJNKSDbW5lrg)\n\nThe free samples of the lavender sea salt short bread cookie enticed my sister and I to check out the rest of their offerings...it was so delicious with a slightly salty and fragrant lavender flavor. The girl who worked there was helpful and friendly too! We ended up getting the cinnamon pear bread ($2.50) and the sand angel cookie ($2.25). The bread was SO moist and filled with bits of pear...I loved the bold cinnamon flavor. It came in a pretty thick slice wasn't too sweet either. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fLL5hu-3oRKZdZjEv3J5Gg?select=5DjBdYJK3qCL9P4HHG9G2w)\n\nThe sand angel cookie was a mix between a snickerdoodle and a ginger cookie according to the worker but I could see why it's a best seller! It was a HUGE cookie and wasn't to soft or crunchy. It tasted like caramel with a hint of spice to me which I absolutely loved! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fLL5hu-3oRKZdZjEv3J5Gg?select=bGqSuZvosBCZp_X7IcMRoQ) I've also had their oatmeal chocolate chip cookie ($2.25) and that was divine as well. I could tell their baked goods were fresh and made with a lot of heart. \n\nThe portions were definitely not small so the prices were reasonable.

By taking this over, I had one less thing to worry about on the day of our wedding ... which meant I got to enjoy myself even more! \n\nI would say the ONLY difficult part about working with Batter Bakery was deciding what flavor of cookie to use because they are all soooooo good!

The concept of Batter, an extremely small pastry stand with the main bakery across town, is a welcome import.  It offers a lot of different types of baked goods (cookies, cupcakes, brownies, muffins, scones, biscotti, bars, etc.) that you might begin to wonder if they can be superior in them all or any of them.  Having only tried the cookies and cupcakes, I wasn't blown away.  However, they were tasty and I'm motivated to try other dessert items in search of that \"win\" category.\n\nSand Angels: Touted as \"Batter's Signature\", I had to try it.  Allegedly the ingredients are top secret.  I got the taste sensation of cinnamon apples.  Moist and chewy despite not being fresh out of the oven.  I usually don't like praising chains, but I give credit when credit is due.  Specialty's may not use organic ingredients and unique recipes, but they are a better afternoon cookie option because of the fresh gooeyness of cookies that have just been just baked.  If only Batter wasn't confined to such a small stand...\n\nRed Velvet - Cream Cheese Cupcake: Small red velvet cupcake topped with a wobbly dollop of cream cheese frosting.  Maybe I'm biased because of Red Velvet cupcakes from Magnolia's and Billy's in Manhattan, but the frosting just did not wow me.  Firmer and creamier would be much preferred to the runny glob.  There is also a red candy coated chocolate on top.  Looks nice, but the chocolate taste is inconsistent with the overall red velvet experience and probably better without.\n\nGerman Chocolate - Coconut Pecan Cupcake: The frosting is a big win for me!  Loved the coconut and pecans connected by an almost caramel paste.  The chocolate cup cake base was nice, though could stand to be moister.  Again, the chocolate candy topping was a little unnecessary.  It was a chocolate disk without a coating and added a texture that didn't mesh well the otherwise pleasant sticky topping.", "author": "Adam B."}

At any rate, Batter Bakery is another hip, smart food service concept aimed at entering a highly profitable market with lower start up costs than a full service restaurant as well as the ability to sell to restaurants,  markets and individual customers thereby tripling the profit potential.  It's a smart business with enormous margins if managed properly.  From the experience I've had with Batter Bakery, they measure up beautifully to the creative business plan they started with.\n\nBatter Bakery scones are among the best I've ever found in San Francisco and deserve a place in the scone hall of fame should it ever arrive.   The company behind Batter Bakery is smart and efficient with a highly profitable business model I hope succeeds.  The kiosks were provided to San Francisco by the French outdoor advertising company who agreed while Paris loving former Mayor Willie Brown who occupied the throne at City Hall before Gavin Newsom.  Many ideas were proposed for the 75 or more kiosks given to the city by JD Decaux outdoor advertising for use as news stands, an idea that failed.  Batter Bakery is proving that nothing need be wasted when opened up for the possibilities, and our beauracratic bastion of bumbling blunders finally may decide to bring revenue and job producing activity to another SF snafu.\n\nI think this company produces pretty darn good cookies, muffins, scones, bars, other baked goods and an amazing yogurt breakfast bar where patrons can make their own parfait and walk away deeply satisfied on many levels.  I think this company will bring us many more fine quick food ideas that are organic, nutritious and fun, good job Batter Bakery.", "author": "Stu S."}

At work, sometimes I get an intense craving for baked goods/cupcakes.  Found this little kiosk on a yelp thread and decided to make a late lunch of it.  (Note: I was starving at 3pm, so perhaps that may have influenced my taste buds...)\n\nWhat I got:\n1. red velvet cupcake ($3) - perfect size (not HUGE). Cake was dense, could taste the hint of cocoa in the cake, but cake was kind of dry (maybe b/c the cupcakes were sitting in a box since the morning?). The frosting, though, was purely DELISH.  Creamy, fluffy, smooth texture, melty, tastes like frosting you can make at home, with cream cheese, powdered sugar.  I pretty much ate the cupcake from the top down in 30 seconds. Oh, there is a cute red chocolate-like m&m candy on top of the frosting. I found that the sudden chocolate candy flavor didn't quite go with the cupcake, threw it off. cute, but didn't work, taste-wise.\n\n2. Sand Angel cookie ($2.50-ish?).  Big, somewhat soft cookie. A cross btwn a sugar cookie, snickerdoodle, with some molasses to give it the chewy texture. Lovely!\n\n3. Lavendar Sea Salt Short Bread ($2+?).  I wouldn't normally go for shortbread, but the flavor pairing grabbed me and I love it.  Strong lavendar aroma, so either you'll hate it or love it.\n\nI wish they had a vanilla-vanilla cupcake, my benchmark for comparisons.  Next time!  The lady working there was nice, said they post daily offerings/flavors on their facebook page.\n***\nDay 2, I tried:\n4. Vanilla cupcake with Chocolate Frosting.  Cupcake was too dry (again!), sadly. And lacked vanilla flavor, or discernable flavor. Frosting was good though.  Stick to the frosting at this kiosk...\n\nDay 3:\nRaspberry chocolate chip scone (b/c they sold out of cupcakes!).\nSurprisingly scrumpdilydelicious.  Buttery, not a hockey puck.  The tangy raspberry went so well with the choc. chip.  These scones are pretty big. Full of butter, I'm sure. I felt like a lard-o after eating it, but I enjoyed it!\n\nDay 4:\nStrawberry cupcake w/cream cheese frosting.  Frosting=A. Cake=D.  Had no flavor, tasted a bit like raw dough. Sad, b/c their other cupcakes are pretty good.  Jennifer, please work on recipe!\n\nDay 5:\nOatmeal Cherry Cookie.  Oatmeal cookie w/dried cherries.  This was ok.

I can literally eat an entire bag in one sitting.  It's something that I crave every week.  I've also tried their shortbread cookies, which are really good.  One in particular, the Lavender Sea Salt Shortbread Cookies, is a great mix of salty sweet.  I like the balance of the two flavors.  Some may not agree, especially if the taste/smell of Lavender is not so appealing to you.  But, I don't think it's too overpowering, so I enjoy it.  With the subtle sprinkling of sea salt on top.  It's another win for Battery Bakery.  I can't wait to try the rest of their baked goods.  \n\nThey accept CC.  Being a little kiosk there is only one person manning the place.  So, you may find it is temporarily closed for a short while during the day.  But, don't fret.  Just check the note they leave as to what time they'll be back.

The combination of savory and sweet is perfect...neither flavor is over-powering.  Next are the mini cupcakes.  The pumpkin is mmm mmm good...the cupcake is soft and moist, and the cream cheese frosting is ooooey gooey goodness.  The red velvet cupcake is a bit on the dry side, but I do love the cream cheese frosting again.  The brownies are really rich...I can only handle eating about a 1/4 of it.
