The gyoza have thin pastry instead of the thick kind that you usually see and is quite nice. It was about $35 for six gyoza, a substantial maki, two orders of nigiri and miso. The fish is fresh and clean. I would definitely order from them again and recommend it. \n\nGenerous portions on the nigiri, everything I've tasted so far is delicious. \n\nI wouldn't change anything about the food but I would like nicer chopstix and a  container to mix the soy sauce in\n\nETA: Near the end I bit down on something hard and spat out a slice of bone that somehow got in my Hamachi roll. !?!

The atmosphere here was nice and quiet. \n\nWe decided to go with the lunch combos. Definitely a steal and very filling. We got the combo a (chicken teriyaki + tempura + ca roll), combo b (shrimp tempura + 5 nigiri), and a bay scallop roll. Way too much food for the two of us, but definitely had a hard time deciding and wanted everything. \n\nThe waitress also listed a bunch of specials but we had a difficult time understanding plus there seemed to be so many specials. Would had liked it if they can just list their specials on a board. Would make it easier for the waitresses too. \n\nOmg the presentation of their food is gorgeous. Love the nigiri, the fish was very fresh and definitely melts in your mouth. My favorite was the salmon belly ! The shrimp tempura roll and CA roll was pretty good. We found the chicken teriyaki to be solid but a little on the dry side. The tempura was so delicious. But I love tempura and fried food so fresh tempura is usually always a hit with me ! Love the bay scallop roll. A little heavy on the sauce for me. But will definitely be back to try their other rolls.\n\nPlus don't forget to check in for that huge portion of seaweed salad !", "author": "Wendy L."}

They are fairly indistinguishable from one another. Step 3. Accept that they are generally decent but are aimed at Americans. Step 4. Find a couple of decent ones as your go to places. Did you sense my sense resignation? It is true. Great expectations result in great disappointments. Setting realistic expectations will make you appreciate the little things in life and live longer and happier.\n\nFor instance, if checking in on yelp, you get a free seaweed salad. The rolls are robust and fresh and flavorful. Like in Japan, you do not need wasabi or soy to wash them down.  The Hamachi appetizer is surprisingly large in portion and very filling and super good to boot. \n\nThe setting is nice. The bar seating is very comfortable and not crowded. it's a cut above your usual Inner Richmond sushi joints.

I've only seen pictures of their rolls on yelp, but they looked really good! We ended up ordering three rolls to share:\n\n- Bay Island Roll: My favorite roll! I loved the seared scallops on top (tbh I love anything seared hahaha), the sauces, and the unagi!\n- Sunset Stripped Roll: We ordered this sans the soy paper and subbed it for nori, and added rice. This roll was so simple, but you could really taste how fresh the fish was! These were bigger pieces, so I believe the roll only came with 5 pieces.\n- Bento Maki Roll: Soft shell crab topped with different types of fish--I enjoyed the crunch of this roll, but probably would try a diff roll next time.\n\nThere's also a yelp check-in deal where you get a free seaweed salad upon check-in! Take advantage!\n\nService was friendly and the sushi was great! I'll be back! The omakase also caught my eye at $38, maybe next time.", "author": "Tara A."}

The restaurant was empty and we were quickly seated.\n\nBoyfriend ordered the combo lunch with three items ($14.95): California roll, tempura, and I think a teriyaki chicken. This also came with rice, salad, and miso soup. I ordered the vegetable udon ($9.) \n\nThe udon didn't taste like Japanese udon at all. The restaurant used chicken soup and non traditional vegetables (like bok choy), as compared to the sansai (mountain vegetable) udon I've had at authentic Japanese restaurants. In addition, the portion was small. I was not full, and went to another cafe immediately afterwards for an acai bowl. On the other hand, the combo lunch seemed a bit better - it was a lot of food for a pretty good price. I didn't like how the restaurant added furikake to the outside of the California rolls though. \n\nService was great, perhaps because we were the only ones dining in the restaurant. Waiters would check up on us frequently and were genuinely friendly. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't eat here again - $$ for not very good food.", "author": "Christine L."}

It's located in a quiet neighborhood of the Inner Richmond. So we drove all the way from downtown on a Friday night and was immediately seated without fuss. \n\nOur friends are regulars here and swear by their sashimi. They are right! The omakase selection which is priced at $38, offers thick cuts of fresh fish. Mind you, these aren't your more unusual cuts of fish, but rather composed of the more commonly known varieties such as tuna, yellowtail, salmon, etc. But you can't beat that price for the amount of food that you get!\n\nWe also enjoyed several apps from agedashi tofu (served with mushrooms and scallions in a light dashi broth), scallop and crab cakes (with pickled cucumber and jalapenos), baked mussels (with tobiko and green onion) and hamachi carpaccio topped with avocado and jalapenos. Everything was well prepared and provided a lovely segue into our meal.\n\nThey also have Americanized rolls doused in special sauces to cater to palates not used to pure sashimi ;-) If you're watching your carb intake,  get the Sunset Stripped roll which has salmon, hamachi, tuna, avocado and tobiko wrapped in cucumber. I could eat two of this and not get tired of it, because it's so incredibly delicious!\n\nI love the service provided by the amicable staff, they truly make you feel welcome at their restaurant.

After 25 delivery orders, I've decided to finally write a review.  \n\nIf quality of fish is important to you, then Mizutani is your place.  The maguro nigiri, salmon nigiri, chu-toro nigiri, and pretty much any other nigiri I've had from them have all been quite good and very consistent each time.  O-toro delivery?  Yes, they do that too and it's damn good.  Their tamago is good and takes different shapes depending on the chef.  Kuradai, saba,  escolar, tobiki, all quite good.  Yes, you may be able get better fish from an omakase joint, but Mizutani is hands down the best bang for your buck quality fish you will get for Sushi delivery.\n\nI highly recommend any of the basic maki rolls: tekka maki, negi toro maki, sake maki, hamachi maki.  As most mid level sushi places, these type of rolls are just stomach filler.  At Mizutani, these rolls are made very well so the quality of the fish is able to shine through.  You're getting sushi - doesn't that mean you want good quality fish? Mizutani has shown me that if a sushi place can't make a good tekka roll, it's not worth going back.  If a place needs to dress its rolls up with things like wasabi mayo or whatever summer sauce is, then they are often trying to mask the fact that they have low quality fish.  This is not the case at Mizutani.\n\nTry delivery from this place.  You never knew delivery sushi could taste so good.", "author": "Zach M."}

The fish was so fresh, and you can just tell by the way it melts in your mouth. Stunning! (Check out the pictures).\n\nI also got a two rolls: one with Tuna and one with Salmon.

The food does not come out quick but the end result is unbelievable. \n\nFinal verdict: Top notch service, high qualty fish and amazing presentation are just a few things that make this a true gem of the Richmond District. There's not many places that manage to nail every aspect of what a restaurant needs to succeed, but these guys knock it out of the park. Make your way over here.", "author": "Alex B."}

This place had some good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. The food was great. Beautiful presentation and delicious. \n\nThe hamachi carpaccio was of particular note. I could have had a few orders of that!  There was a surprise salad that arrived, complimentary- mixed greens and iceberg lettuce with a ginger peanut dressing that was wonderful. We had the Dynamite Roll (amazing) and the California Roll, which was unique with a crunchy topping.\n\nI might remove one star because we were there for a long time. 2 hours. We had 2 tables beside us who arrived after us and their orders were taken before ours. There was inconsistent attentiveness. They also forgot one of the rolls we ordered, even after reminding them that it hadn't come. We were full anyhow but it was just the principle of it. \n\nI would definitely go back - I still want to try that other roll!!", "author": "Traci B."}

Recently I finally did so in a Sunday evening because I was going to nearby Sakesan but there was a long wait for a table, so I decided to come here instead.\n\nI ordered their chirashi. Their sushi rice was quite good, done in a way to match that which I experienced and loved previously. As for the fish, overall it was mostly good but the butterfish felt like it could've been better. It's usually one of my favorite standards next to hamachi. The red tuna and salmon were fresh and good, though doesn't quite match places I consider as favorites for (I know it may be unfair to compare like that but that's what been happening now that I established places as favorites for certain items). I also ordered their two-piece oyster special (midnight oyster) but was disappointed in its make-up; I've had better for similar price at some other places I've often visited.\n\nOn the other hand, the complementary salad that come with my order was definitely a plus.\n\nThe service was nice from the two young ladies I got services from. Especially liked the one wearing the grey t-shirt that night. :)\n\nI'd say 3.5-plus stars for the above, which would've made it four stars. Unfortunately I was disappointed by one thing. When they asked me what I want to drink I asked for tea like at most Asian restaurants, but didn't realize they charged $1 here. I would've asked for water if I had known especially since I was figuring on ordering some kind of sake like I often do at a place like this.

I tried sushi for the first time here. Being a vegetarian that is a BIG thing for me!!  I was always skeptical of the vegan/vegetarian sushi, tasting as good. But I was proven wrong, and since then I have never missed a chance to go to this place and have sushi. What an outstanding place! \n\nI would highly recommend their Avocado Inari and Asparagus Maki, Avocado Cucumber, Carrots and Sesame Maki and Eggplant Maki. I have always ordered atleast one of each and it has never disappointed. The rolls just perfectly melt-in-your-mouth and are very flavorful. I also like their candied ginger which is a lovely accompaniment to the sushi.The wasabi here is milder than most places though. Also there is a always this complimentary salad, which has the perfect peanut sauce dressing.\n\nYou would also want to try the sake or the tea. Usually they have the brown rice tea, which i feel balances out the sushi perfectly.\n\nI find their food, service and ambiance flawless. They always make you feel welcome and serve incredibly fresh sushi. Sometimes even adhere to my whims and fancies when I order custom rolls or ask for an extra dash of sesame seeds. Kudos guys!!

After a search on the Yelp mobile app, it was down to 3 options that were within a 20-minute walking distance. Mizutani looked & sounded appealing and it fit the price expectation for that night (I was more in the mood for a cozy neighborhood spot than a fancy $$$$ place with a sushi tasting menu). \n\nThe place was somewhat empty when we arrived, with just one other table occupied, but filled up throughout our meal there. The decor is clean and simple, in line with most sushi places I have been to. Our waitress was extremely sweet and attentive throughout our whole dining experience. \n\nWe opted for the following food:\n\nSpecial of the day - Midnight oysters: raw oysters topped with a quail egg yolk, tobiko, and scallions. These were super fresh and purely delicious. I generally like my oysters clean with nothing on them, but in this case I was pleasantly surprised. It felt very reminiscent of a hamachi shooter.\n\nSashimi Sampler - 20 pieces of 5 assorted fish varieties (maguro, saba, sake, hamachi, escolar). The fish was super fresh, served as generous thick cuts, and very tender. \n\nWe also ordered a couple of their specialty rolls. Minimal rice and lots of actual fish and veggies inside, just the way I love my rolls. \n\nMizutani will be a go-to spot when I crave some sashimi, rolls, and a large hot sake!", "author": "Anna R."}

The salmon and tuna were very fresh though. We also ordered the Cherry Blossom roll: salmon avocado sushi wrapped in tuna. This roll was the highlight of our meal imo. \n\nWe came here on a pretty chilly night so I was excited to warm up with some hot tea, but their teapots and cups do not insulate well so the tea cooled down within a few minutes.

My friend and I came here after not being about to get in at another restaurant down the street. As promised, there is no line to eat here. It seems the staff and chefs are Cantonese and the menu is mostly of the basic fish varieties and dynamite rolls (you know, huge rolls covered in sauce and scattered with tempura flakes and the like). We sighed and resigned ourselves to a night of mediocre sashimi, but that was not what we got! We ordered a sashimi plate of 10 slices of fish and it came beautifully served on top of a bowl filled with ice. The sashimi pieces were sliced THICK and were fresh and firm. We also got uni nigiri that was fresh and yummy. What really stunned us though, was the live scallops dish which was one of their specials. It ended up being a huge plate of tempura, which the waiter told us was the scallop muscles. It tasted like deep fried onion strings. The actual scallops were really thinly cut and served as 6 pieces of nigiri. There was a also delightful and surprising yuzu sauce to dip those into. The scallops were live, so tasted super fresh. There was so much food that we couldn't finish it all and the bill only came out to $30 per person. That's fairly incredible for super fresh sashimi served in such generous quantities that you can't even finish it! Service was also great. I would definitely come here again for sashimi and for ordering items off their specials menu. The restaurant should also consider expanding their regular menu to include more of their specials and more authentically Japanese items.

We had the Fried oysters, Bay Island roll, and the Godzilla roll on one occasion and the Chirashi and Semibei roll  the next. \n\nThe fried oysters were hot and tasty but a bit small. Definitely liked the Bay Island more than the Godzilla. Godzilla was good, but oddly, thinly sliced. The spicy sauce added some nice heat though, not too much to overpower the other flavors. \n\nThe Chirashi is big enough for two people to share or to satisfy one hungry diner! Lovely selection of fresh fish on top of a good portion of rice. Came with a small salad beforehand. The Sembei roll stole the show though. Crispy, hot, with smooth delicious spicy tuna on top! The tuna has a good amount of heat, more than the spicy sauce, but doesn't distract from the tuna's flavor. Honestly, one piece in one bite is a bit much and you don't get to enjoy the flavors each component has to offer. I'd recommend trying the roll all in one bite first, and then eating the tuna and roll separately to appreciate all the flavors offered.\n\nWe also had the mango shochu cocktail. This actually comes in a large bottle for sharing. It wasn't prepackaged but mixed upon order and it was nice and strong!!

I'm sure sushi purists will try to find complaints but as someone who adores Japanese food but isn't trying to be a sushi snob (we're not looking at jiro dreams of sushi here people!) I wholeheartedly enjoyed every bite at Mizutani. \n\nThe quality of fish was outstanding, the rolls were innovative and the flavors were unique! That is what I noticed the most, it wasn't just the generic flavors you get at any Japanese restaurant, you could tell everything was made in house with a homemade recipe. Great example was in the shared starter salad, it wasn't just the generic ginger soy salad dressing (which don't get me wrong I enjoy the generic kind no matter what) it was a carefully crafted absolutely delicious homemade version of a ginger, sesame dressing that made the complimentary starter salad one of my favorite things I had that night! The Teriyaki also wasn't just that tar-like generic overly salty glaze. Instead it had so many unique flavors that still was reminiscent of teriyaki but with a complexity that I thoroughly appreciated. And yes the summer roll is a fan favorite for good reason, don't miss out! But I also enjoyed their roll's that were wrapped in cucumber instead of rice and seaweed, they were delightfully refreshing. \n\nOf course as everyone has mentioned the service is what makes this place so outstanding. They have a very thoughtful and attentive staff that is eager to give you a great dining experience. This attention to detail is mirrored in the quality and presentation of their food. Don't go in trying to rush in and out, instead I encourage everyone to take their time enjoy the good quality food and even better quality people. They don't rush you or try and get you out the door, it is nice to feel like you can actually take your time and enjoy a good meal with your company once in a while. Mizutani is owned by a couple and you can tell that they put a lot of tender love and care into their business. I support any small business owner but have a soft spot for couples chasing their dreams :)  I will be SURE to be making this my new spot with my girlfriends!", "author": "Katie W."}

We received a complimentary salad which had a gorgeous sesame dressing. My kids had the chicken udon which to my surprise, had a lot of chicken. My 7 year old loves tekka maki and the pieces of tuna were the largest I've seen in this type of roll. He inhaled two rolls so fast I was unable to get a picture to post.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-22", "description": "Came in last night around 9pm for a quick bite while waiting for my GF to get off of work. It wasn't one of those highly anticipated sushi dinners that you spend all day at work dreaming about, just popped in on a whim. We had ordered take out twice before from here but this was my first visit for a sit down meal. The place was mostly empty save for one table in the back so I just picked out a spot at the sushi bar and seated myself. Had no idea at that point how happy I was about to be with my dining experience! \n\nFor starters, service was polite and attentive without being annoyingly overbearing. With the place being as empty as it was, it could've gone either way really.  I asked for water to begin and was given a nice light side salad to get my motor running. I ordered albacore sashimi, which is a go to for me, two of the specialty maki and an Asahi draft. It may have been my lack of expectations but everything really was just perfect. The beer was crisp and cold, the sashimi was fresh and delicious and both rolls were surprisingly fantastic. Went with the Godzilla roll and a Sunset Stripped roll, each was delightful in its own right and complemented one another well. Nice presentation and wonderful flavors. Everything was just the right amount to fill me up and I'm a pretty big guy. No regrets on not ordering a third roll even though I usually get 3-4 rolls w/ sashimi most occasions. Added a to go roll once the GF arrived and we still got out of there under $50\n\nThey have a good amount of basic rolls that're under $10 but most of the specialty rolls are right around the 14 dollar mark. Since it's the grand re-opening after a remodel and ownership change, all orders are 15% off right now. They do deliver but on one occasion during the NBA finals they weren't able to accommodate due to low staff levels. That's somewhat understandable though so I am willing to grade on a curve. Nice ambiance, fresh off of a remodel, but nothing that'll land in Architectural Digest. Flat screen TV above the sushi bar so you won't need to miss the game just to satisfy your fresh fish fix.\n\n*Edit* Forgot to finish my review and post but have eaten here numerous times since and the quality of food and service has held up. Good fish, good service, good call. Will be my go to neighborhood spot for the foreseeable future.", "author": "Kareem C."}

Not only is the sushi excellent, but the family that runs it is warm and service focused. I have tried many different items on the menu and have loved most of them. The fish is top notch and the rolls are creative, interesting and delicious. I highly recommend it for both dine in and takeout.", "author": "Peter J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-27", "description": "Very tasty food; lackluster atmosphere and service.\n\nWent to Mizutani to check it out as I'm new to the neighborhood, and invited my family to come too as they were in town. I called ahead and they took a reservation on a Saturday night with a half-hour notice, which was very nice. When we arrived, we were seated promptly though we didn't have a choice of tables -- ended up being by the door where other parties were waiting, which wasn't ideal, but still workable. The downstairs area doesn't look like there's much thought put into it, atmosphere-wise. Besides the sushi bar and counter, there are 2 4-seater tables and the decoration/lighting/etc is functional and pretty bare bones -- it looks like you'd expect of a waiting area where people pick up takeout, not where parties are seated for dinner. Upstairs was a bit darker and removed from the waiting parties, but the same atmosphere -- bare bones and functionality, so if you're looking for cozy/romantic/atmospheric setting, I would say this place is not it.\n\nWe came for sushi and the sushi didn't disappoint. The menu is large and varied, and there is a lot of sushi variety with cooked fish preparations, which was good for a pregnant lady who is avoiding raw fish. There are also entrees, salads, crudo, etc-- would definitely like to come back and try more of the menu.\n\nWe had the seaweed salad (OK, but for $5 I hate when there's mesclun underneath bulking up the dish's volume -- I like to get all seaweed for the money); the free salad had a very tasty dressing; the house salad was also good. Our variety of rolls was tasty, plentiful, and beautifully presented. The chef's special of raw fish looked fresh and delicious. The only problem is the sushi counter was either backed up, or the system for placing orders isn't working well, because our rolls came out over a really....looong...stretch. We ordered 5 rolls and 2 other dishes for 4 people, and the first person got their food well ahead of the others; then the rolls came out one at a time, with long breaks in between, so by the time those of us who had ordered rolls finally got all of them on the table, the first person who'd been served had finished eating by a long shot. This made for a very awkward and annoying pacing to the meal, especially since some of our rolls were getting cold. It took something like 40-45 minutes between when our first dish and our last arrived, which is unacceptable. And at one point it became clear that they'd forgotten to put one of the orders in. If you are like me and like to assemble everyone's order on the table and eat simultaneously and alternate sushi bites and figure out your bite trading strategy-- this was just a pain in the ass and an annoying experience to our dining companions.\n\nBottom line, food was great and reasonably priced, but pretty disappointed in the service. Might try them again when they're slower so their sushi orders don't back up.", "author": "Nika T."}

Ordered takeout, and opted for two of their special rolls: the Lion King Roll, and the Walnut Prawn Roll.  The Walnut Prawn roll was great - I hadn't tried a comparable roll before, and really enjoyed it.  The Lion King roll was also a good choice.  While not my favorite Lion King Roll of all time, it was still quite solid.  This is a place I can see myself coming back to in the future.  Enjoyable sushi all around.", "author": "Zach S."}

Sometimes they can be a little slow w the delivery (over an hour) but the fish is always really fresh and their rolls are flavorful as is their sashimi. They have nice sized portions for nigiri. If you order over a certain amount they throw in a free California roll which is really well done, I think one of my favorites.", "author": "stephanie s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-04", "description": "This was my 1st time ordering from this place. I wanted to try a different variety from the Japanese restaurant I usually order from.  The sashimi is not fresh. It is gummy and dark in the center which is an indication that it was previously frozen for a lengthy period. Im very particular when it comes to my sashimi.  I did not eat it since the first piece I tried was gummy so I did not want to spend the rest of my day sick from bad sashimi. The rolls are ok. Nothing great but nothing horrible. Price is comparable but not for the quality. I still taste that 1 piece of sashimi I had, thats how fishy it was. I'd pass from ordering here.", "author": "D.T. C."}

I have ordered from this sushi spot around 10 times in the last month. I LOVE them, my special requests are honored almost 100% of the time. Usually my orders are around $35. This evening, I placed an order through Yelp which uses Eat24's service, as I always do. Our order of $60 worth of food took 1 hour and 30 minutes to arrive. Though this was a frustrating wait time, we understand that it was a large order on a Saturday night. What was really frustrating was that after our wait, we received an order with only one set of chopsticks, and one of our meals appeared to be missing. We called the restaurant with our concern,and  explained that we ordered the shrimp tempura roll, but were given the shrimp tempura appetizer. The woman began to explain that I, the consumer made a mistake. Then I continued to explain that what I ordered showed a photo of a shrimp tempura \"roll\" and that's what we wanted. She then told me to call eat24 and find out what went wrong. I told her I was not going to do that, we ordered through a site that they use, and it is not my job as a consumer to check that the menu is represented correctly. I explained this was someone's dinner, and she again tried to tell me to call eat 24. The conversation was quite upsetting and we informed the woman we would not be ordering from them again, and were going to write a poor review. We decided to call once more, and speak to a manger. Glad we did. David, the manager, promptly offered to credit us for the correct roll, or bring it tonight. We opted to have it tonight, given it was someone's dinner. The roll arrived within 10 minutes, we believe David delivered it himself. We were quite impressed with the turn around. I am happy to say I will continue to be a loyal customer, I just may think twice before ordering during a busy time.", "author": "Kristina H."}
