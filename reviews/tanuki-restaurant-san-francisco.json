The restaurant was pretty empty for a Saturday night. That should've been a sign but since we heard such glowing reviews, we decided to try this place. Waitresses were very friendly and pretty attentive. Now on to the food.\n\nUni: vibrant colors and very creamy texture. Not the best I've ever had but definitely pretty good. It's funny cause I heard one of the chefs say in honest \"Uni is very fresh but I'm not too sure about everything else\" \n\nOyster shooters: oyster wasn't very fresh. Even with all the sauce, I could still taste the funky after taste.\n\nCalifornia roll: $8.50 for 6 pieces? They used real crab which was well blended with the mayo, but I still can't justify that pricing. \n\nBeef teriyaki: we order medium rare and they gave us rare. My boyfriend was ecstatic about the rare steak but I definitely would've done without this dish. \n\nToro: it had that melt in your mouth texture which was great. \n\nLobster tempura: saltiest tempura I've ever had in my entire life. It felt like the chef accidentally knocked over a salt shaker on to the batter and just decided it wasn't worth his time to start over. My boyfriend and I aren't ones to waste but we only had one piece each and couldn't bring ourselves to finish it. \n\nReally wanted to like this place but it's a no go for me.", "author": "Ada H."}

I attributed it to doing business in San Francisco.\n\nMiso soup, noodle salad, rice, and the dinner combo. The noodle salad was ice cold and too peppery.  Not like how it used to be. And a soup spoon in the soup bowl.  We both thought that was a first for us in a Japanese restaurant. \n\nHubby also had the dinner combo- sashimi with tonkatsu.  The tonkatsu was like a thin sheet of paper.  \n\nThe sashimi was fresh.  It came on a plate.  But no ginger.  And a tiny dollop of wasabi.  My sukiyaki lacked yam noodles.

I was often with other people and I don't do well in a larger group. This is in her hood, and she's eaten Christmas eve dinner here just recently and liked it. My companion also suggested it after learning our original place was closed. I walked a few blocks to get here, on foot. It was a quiet early evening, the moon was hanging low, the air was warm and I was in a calm, contemplative mood. There were a few options on Clement, but I'm under strict order by another friend to avoid being on Clement between 5th and 9th, in case I might run into him and his family, and some awkward pleasantry and greeting might be contemplated. I don't do well with fake pleasantries either. So here we are. Seemly like a perfect dining choice for all the reasons listed.\n\nBut from the get go, there were a few issues with the ambience. Bright lights, like you are under interrogation. Not romantic nor stylish. It's obviously popular, the bar was filled so were the tables. This particular night there were a group of 4 and 5 occupying the entire bar and they were drunk and exceptionally loud. I pulled out the sound meter to measure, if any louder, my ears would go deaf. A popular restaurant like this should tell patrons to lower their volume, this would never ever be tolerated in a better managed restaurant. Sadly it was the loud mouth drunk bully night and it was clear we were not the only ones who were annoyed, other people did not like it too, but being this was a pleasant society we live in, no one said a thing. As the evening went on, they were becoming even more obnoxious, doing shots at the bar and thoroughly forgetting this is not their own living room, others were trying to have a conversation and enjoying their meals too. It felt like that we were stuck in an insane asylum with the inmates running it. \n\nFood was decent. The hamachi was palatable. The monk fish liver was relatively fresh. The rolls were good but not great. It's your stereotypical American style sushi joint with a lot of California style sushi, lots of mayo, lots of sauces to cover the less than best quality sushi. It lacked authenticity to say the least.\n\nI understand this is a crowd pleaser from other reviews, but it's not outstanding. and the other obnoxious drunken loud diners really made the experience less than pleasant.\n\nIn the morning when we woke up we said to each other in unison, \"last night those diners were really loud.\" It might not be good, it was certainly a memorable experience. The walk from 7th and Fulton was nice and leisurely. The food was decent... But I had expected more. \n\nThey say Yelp reviews can be a hit or miss. For me, this is a miss.

I have here at Tanuki Restaurant.   \nI have sushi at least twice a week for the nutrition.  \n\nI love Tanuki Restaurant since they serve fresh raw fish.  Just one block from the busy Clement Street, this restaurant sits quietly. I visited this restaurant by myself for the 5th time the other day. Sushi on a chilly day? I must be crazy. \n\nI order the combination of nigiri sushi which cost around 18 dollars. I am not against sushi rolls, the great American sushi invention but I want to enjoy the original flavor of fish and that is all. Still I never order anything with spicy sauce since the sauce was originally invented to hide the bad color and the taste of old tuna. Have you ever wondered why we always see \"spicy\" and \"tuna\" side by side and not \"spicy yellowtail or \"spicy eel????\"  At this restaurant, you can enjoy anything with spicy sauce without worries because the chefs are sincere and the fish is fresh. \n\nThey serve a pot of green tea and pickles first and I like that. Green tea and sushi match very well. My nigiri sushi was beautiful on the white plate. Here comes my \"zen\" moment.  I closed my eyes and prepared for my eating sushi with the calmest mind. \nI usually have sushi in the order of \"from subtle flavors to bold rich flavors\" but there is no formal order to eat sushi. I usually turn nigiri 90 degrees so one of the chopsticks holds fish and the other holds the rice, and then dip it in soy sauce lightly. If you see something on your sushi, like mackerel here, you can't turn your sushi 90 degrees. The best way is to use your ginger piece as a soy sauce brush. It is a good sushi manner which doesn't cause a mess. \n I may look cool to others but when I have sushi, I am very excited. Here was what I was thinking. \n\nGeoduck......(Hmmm, the subtle flavor of oceans as if I were sitting by the seashore) \nOctopus.......(Hello, Taurine. Go ahead, control my cholesterol!)\nTuna............(The beauty in red, lower my blood pressure, please.)\nSalmon Roes..(Oh boy, they are dancing in my mouth. Delicious! )\nSea Urchin....(I can see the grain! This must be fresh. No bitter taste so this must be from Santa Barbara, not from the East Coast.)\nSalmon & Yellowtail...(Gosh, they are so buttery and delicious!)\nMackerel......(O-M-G! They were cured very well and very fatty. No hint of fishiness. Hello, Omega 3, improve my blood circulation.) \n\nSo I ended up ordering extra mackerel. Some Japanese people order egg sushi first to see how sushi is good at a restaurant but at some restaurants, they buy the egg omelet from stores so it always doesn't work. To judge the skill of sushi chefs, I recommend you order mackerel. Do they make home-made omelet here? Yes. When I was there, they were making it for dinner time and I received the sampler. It was good as well. \nI haven't tried many hot dishes here but if you like sushi, I highly recommend this restaurant. This restaurant is often visited by Japanese celebrities from Japan so if you see them, please get me their autographs!

The place is tiny but we were seated after a couple minutes.  The menu and specials reflected very simple, home cooked Japanese food with no frills.\n\nWe ordered four udons, one katsu donburi and two rolls to share for an appetizer.  Hot green tea was brought out immediately.  I can't remember which rolls we ordered but they were pure fish, no extra fried or saucy components.  Whatever it was, it was really fresh and really good.  The udon came out and all conversation died, it was all slurp slurp slurp.  I don't eat udon very often but I would eat more if they all tasted like this.  I ordered the nabeyaki udon.  The broth is full of flavor but not too rich or heavy like ramen broth can be.  The udon noodles were nicely chewy.  There were tons of tempura pieces plus an egg.  My friend did not enjoy his katsu donburi but I wouldn't hold it against Tanuki.  He didn't know what it was before hand and didn't expect an egg cake on top of rice.\n\nThe service was good, udon was delicious an filling and I will definitely be back to have more of the sushi.", "author": "Emmi D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-27", "description": "Maybe it's just me, but I've always thought of Tanuki as an institution - it's been around since forever, and it looks mostly the same as it did years ago (other than periodic touch-ups).  It's small and quaint, but it just feels like a legit Japanese restaurant.  Plus, as far back as I can remember, Tanuki was my first experience with Japanese food.  Maybe that's why I love the stuff so much...or maybe it's just because it's good.\n\nGrowing up, I mostly stuck with Tanuki's combinations, but I usually go with their sashimi/sushi nowadays.  You can't really go wrong either way - the food is generally solid regardless.  The rolls are reasonably priced for the most part, though a few top out around $15 or so.  When I dropped in with my friend last night, we ordered four between us and they were all pretty decent.  None were fantastic, but the Tanuki (shrimp tempura topped with unagi, marinated eggplant and avocado) and Scallop Lover (spicy tuna topped with hotate and spicy tobiko) could have been with a tweak here or there (like using raw spicy tuna instead of cooked).\n\nTo get the best out of Tanuki though, the sashimi and their more \"authentic\" dishes are the route to go.  The sashimi is generally really fresh, and the cuts are tasty.  I haven't tried everything they have to offer, but their hamachi has been my favorite.  Also, the Uni and Oyster shots (with raw quail egg, lemon, and ponzu sauce) were awesome, and the Chawan Mushi we tried was terrific (though a little different since they use chicken instead of shrimp/seafood).\n\nDepending on what you order, parts of their menu can be relatively pricey...but you also pretty much get what you pay for.  And considering they've maintained the same level of quality after all these years, it's not a terrible difference to get that type of consistency.", "author": "Mike L."}

My parents have been coming here since they first moved to the Bay Area, and we are well acquainted with the owner. That being said, it certainly doesn't change the fact that the food here is really DAMN good. We choose to make the trek all the way out to Tanuki to simply support Aki-san and his family and to eat some real quality Japanese food. I can still remember my first experience here, stopping in for lunch with my dad while he was on business in the city. I was about 6 or 7 and we sat at the bar since there was a Giants game on. And I still remember how fresh the sushi was, how good the miso soup was, how crispy and juicy my tonkatsu was! For me, nothing's changed, in fact it's probably gotten even better. \n\nThis review isn't to high light any particular experience I've had at this establishment, because there have been several. We celebrate birthdays, graduations, and host people from out of town here. The service is always great, and I suppose that could be due to the fact that we have a history with this place but we've never felt neglected or unwelcome or bothersome to the staff. Recently, Aki-san has branched out in to trying more \"American-ized\" rolls that are certainly non traditional, but they are still delicious. I admire their tenacity and their willingness to adapt to the times and to their changing environment. Through ups and downs, this restaurant still remains and I hope that will never change either! \n\nWhat I recommend: A combination of both sushi items and cooked items, because they are both equally delicious here. In particular, the more subtle and traditional dishes. White tuna salad, agedashi tofu, buta the black pork special is absolutely divine, shiro maguro tataki, tonkatsu my personal childhood favorite lol, any of the fresh sushi / sashimi combos, and definitely try the white albacore/garlic/onion sushi roll special they have written on the specials board!", "author": "Mariko M."}

It has a wider variety of fish compared to a lot of other places too.\n\nI highly recommend you swing by this place because the sushi and food overall is amazing.

Pretty average Japanese food (2 stars counts as average for our reviews).\n\nOur main complaint was the spicy dragon roll wasn't particularly spicy at all and despite just listing \"tuna\" as an ingredient, instead came with cooked tuna which tasted more like canned tuna.  Not at all what we expected - which would be fine if this was an interesting variant, but the cooked meat just didn't work in the dish at all. And it was also drowned in way too much of a mayonnaise-ish sauce. A scallop roll wasn't much better.\n\n The grilled miso eggplant was just okay as well, with a sweet miso sauce. The agedashi tofu was decent, as was a cold noodle salad (especially for the price), but overall our meal only warranted 2 stars.", "author": "Amy D."}

The sukiyaki was perfectly cooked and had a delicious sauce, like the kind you just want to drown your rice bowl in. The sukiyaki also included some soft tofu and veggies that complemented the beef. The large portion of the hamachi kama was also very will grilled and meaty!\n\nThe only thing to really note at Tanuki is the slow service.

Located on a quiet block in the Richmond District, this is my sleeper pick for a nice, quiet (perhaps romantic) dinner. The menu is pretty extensive with its appetizers, sushi/sashimi choices, dinners (solo or combinations), and noodles (udon, soba, and ramen). The daily specials are located on a chalkboard behind the sushi chefs and many sounded very tempting, especially the Lobster Handroll. We shared the following: \nAppetizers \nAgedashi tofu - Deep fried tofu pillows topped with diced green onion and shredded nori strips; a small bowl of tempura sauce is served for dipping (like that it's separate so that the tofu is not soggy). \nCrab salad - A mixture of some spinach and wild greens with shredded snow or king crab. Again, the salad dressing is served in separate small dishes, one with a vinegar soy and the other a sesame dressing. \nSushi \nNorthern Roll - Eel, avocado, and snow or king crab. (6 pcs.) \nSpace Roll - Tuna (Maguro), Hamachi (yellowtail), and eel ( 6 pcs.) \nNigiri Unagi - Eel ( 2 pcs.) \nDinner Combination \nTempura and Beef Sukiyaki - My favorite entree here is the Beef Sukiyaki which feature thinly sliced beef in a sweet soy based broth with tofu, clear rice noodles, fresh mushrooms, bamboo shoot slices, and shredded green onion. The tempura includes two prawns, one yam, one zucchini, one eggplant, one mushroom, and one Japanese pumpkin, I believe. \nThe complete dinners come with a salad of rice noodles, ham, and cucumber in a light mayonnaise and bowl of miso soup. \nDinner came to $57.00 before tip, pretty reasonable the amount of food we ordered. Having a light lunch, I was not shy in making the food mysteriously disappear. The customers varied from singles on the sushi bar, young couples and large families (bumped into a Chinatown restaurant-owning family tonight here) dining at the tables. Normally, I wouldn't encourage eating here because of the notorious Richmond District parking reputation, but the trick is arriving shortly before 8 pm and finding a designated bus stop. For a late dinner, this is definitely one find to tuck in your pocket. Also, remember to try the wrapped chocolate that comes with the bill. This will add to the sweet taste in your mouth after you've eaten here.", "author": "Mike C."}

It's a casual, romantic setting ready for some good food.\n\nI ordered the tenzaru soba ( i LOVE cold soba!), the seaweed salad. The beau ordered tako nigiri and a combo of teriyaki and a side of tuna sashimi. It was brought out very timely, so we were very pleased. The tempura vegetables and prawn had a sweet crisp batter I dipped into the noodle sauce, since...i don't know if they provided tempura sauce. It was great though! The tako had a dip of wasabi in it, which freaked me out since I don't like wasabi.............................(yea i know..)\n\nThe only thing off was that we ordered the Space Roll, sounded delightful, but it never came out. We looked on the bill, turns out the waiter never wrote it down. There was plenty on the table to fill us up so we didn't say anything, and as long as they didn't charge it for it, it's all good!\n\nWe didn't order drinks or anything. It was one of those meals that I truly enjoyed to even think about anything else to could be added to it, except tempura sauce? ahahah. Overall, meal was great, service was good, atmosphere was cheerful and friendly, and it wasn't too cold or too hot in the restaurant (which is oddly very important to me).

A waitress quickly served me a complementary pot of hot tea.  I ordered 2 satisfying dishes: spider roll and adegashi tofu.  The 8-piece spider roll has 1/2 fried soft shell crab, snow crab here and there, 1/2 asparagus stalk, Chinese broccoli, fish eggs, 2 thin sticks of pickled carrot, 1 thin stick of cucumber.  I found the Chinese broccoli a pleasant surprise.  I did not expect it but was pleased to eat my leafy green.  If you enjoy tofu like me, the adegashi tofu could be a 10/10 if they serve the broth on the side instead of on the tofu.  The tempura tofu became a bit soggy once soaked in the broth, but it was still a 9/10 for me.\n\nBeside the good food and service, I found the restaurant very small, cramped, and dirty.  Dated and discolored carpet.  Tiny restrooms with not-so-clean smell.  They should VACUUM at least twice daily, especially btw lunch and dinner.  They should repaint the interior walls and remodel.  Despite good food and service, I will not take my husband or friends here due to the lack of ambiance and cleanliness.  Pricing wise, it's similar to Yuubi, Ebisu, Chin, ...  Yuubi and Ebisu are much cleaner than Tanuki.", "author": "G D."}

I have been a loyal customer to Tanuki since i was 4 years old! My first experience at a sushi bar has been at Tanuki and many holidays and late nights have been spent there. Tanuki has been, and will be my favorite japanese restaurant EVER.\n\nIt is owned and run by an old japanese couple.  The sushi chef and owner, Aki-san, is probably the nicest guy i have ever met.  If you decide to sit at the bar he will randomly give you free mini-dishes like natto or mini sushi wrapped with lettuce rather than seaweed.  Aside from the friendly but quite atmosphere of the store, the food is amazing.  My family is half-japanese so I'd like to say I do have some experience in japanese food.  My favorite dish would be the sukiyaki.  It can be quite a lot so I suggest sharing it with another person.  They also have a smaller version if you decide to order a combo with sukiyaki.  I also enjoy the Chicken kara-age and their tempura.  A word of warning though, the food fills you up surprisingly fast, so watch what you order!\n\nIf you are yelping this restaurant right now definitely go check it out! It's definitely a restaurant worth going to. oh! and don't hesitate to make friends with aki-san! It never hurts to have a sushi-chef friend.", "author": "Kyle G."}

Awebi is abalone and this was the first time I've ever had it.  The texture is more firm than clam.  Slightly crunchy.  More crunchy than chewy.  Sweet.  With slightly firmer/crunchier around the edge.  \n\nLou and I sat at the bar.  This is our new thing.  We're going to sit at the bar because I can't stand to look at him the whole dinner.  And because I get uncomfortable when someone watches me eat.  I think I'm well on my way to getting a serious eating disorder.\n\nThe sushi bar glass case was chock full of fish and shellfish.  It was impressively varied and colorful.  I saw the mirugai hiding behind the abalone, different tuna, lobster, and at the very very end, the elusive uni.  \n\nWe ordered: \nshiro maguro - melt in your mouth goodness.  Do not accept escolar/butter fish as a substituted, it should be albacore.\nuni - I will arm wrestle anyone for the last piece of uni.  This was the best taste/texture/firmness uni that I've had.  It was chilled and firm.\nmirugai - alas, it was already prepared so I did not get to see the chef do rude things to peen-peen.\nabalone - all things considered, I'd chose another uni over this though it was very good.  it's just not my thing.\nsaba - green onion does wonders for this fishy fishy.  \naji - new favorite mackeral-thing.  grated ginger!\nmiso soup - tofu and seaweed was plentiful.\n\nThe couple next to us got this foil steamed thing that looked like an alien-repelling helmet.  But I think it was a popular thing because several more people got it.  I wanted to do an uni shot but Lou wanted just a piece of uni.  Like I said, arm wrestle.  \n\nThe more I eat sushi, the more I am disenchanted by jive-ass rolls.  They never come out as pretty as the pictures.  This place had terrific fish, terrific service, and was the perfect thing on a foggy monday night.  I hate mondays but Tanuki makes it something to look forward to.\n\n--------------------\nUPDATE 10/15/09\n\nI am not proud to say that I cheat on my BF with food.  Yes.  It's true.  I would rather have a nice nigiri snack/dinner by myself than eat it with him.  I would rather have fish than toast.  I like it raw.  Cherry cherry boom boom.  \n\nMy BF informed me that he was going to be late coming home, 7pm or later.  I was home at 5pm.  What did I do?  I took the bus to Tanuki.  I ordered the seafood sunomono, 1 aji, 1 ika, and 2 uni.  I had 4 beautiful pieces of uni prostrating at my fingers, slipping down my throat and putting a cheese-eating grin on my face from ear to ear.  Smiling causes wrinkles but I didn't care.  I've got some uni in my mouth, leave me alone.\n\nThe seafood sunomono was briming with all sorts of seafood.  There was dungeness crab, ebi, ika, tako, white fish, tuna, salmon, so much stuff.  I like the cucumbers at Kazu better because at Tanuki, there was so much seafood, the cucumbers were a mere formality.  Practically a garnish.  And it was $6.50.  \n\nSushi Chef, will you marry me?

(To me, it's the tastier version of cole slaw, and I don't like eating cole slaw. Yeah I'm weird.) My mom is a big fan of their green salad, mainly because of the dressing that they use. Their salad bowl portion is decently sized too, usually to the point where my mom has to split it with my dad, who isn't a huge fan of salad. \n\nTheir sushi, for the most part, has never disappointed me. They use real ingredients to make their California roll, not imitation shrimp. I usually order their Okame udon because it tastes so clean. Some Japanese places that I go to, their vegetarian udon has too much stuff in it. This place does it perfectly, with few slices of fish cake, mushrooms, beans and green onions. My parents usually order their salmon teriyaki or the beef donburi. I will admit, the beef donburi tastes pretty good too.\n\nThey don't allow reservations unless you have a huge party (i.e. 6 or more). They get busy on weekend nights starting at 7pm. Parking can be a pain at times. Service in general is decent but the waiters/waitresses are pretty busy, so if you need something you'll need to flag them down.

Pleasant waitresses and welcoming sushi chef to make you feel comfortable. \n\nBeing a backpacker, this place was a little bit high on our expenditure - but it was worth it. My friend and I ordered their udons and their sashimi together with their sake selection. \n\nMy take:\n\nUdon - 9/10, noodle was soft and chewy, authentic enough. Soup base was great, very savoury but might a bit salty towards the end of the meal. Generally, it was an excellent bowl of udon(beef and tempura). Delicious!!!\n\nSashimi - 6/10, coming from an asian country myself, I have definitely tasted better grades of sashimi. Only tried the salmon sashimi. Portions and cuts were thick and nice, comfortable portions. But texture wise, it was a tad mushy for me, just a little bit, and it was on the average side. Like I said again, being an asian, I have definitely tried better ones back home. Thumbs up though for the sashimi. Pretty good for an outlet in the states. 12 moderately thick slices of sashimi for 17 bucks(a rip off to me)\n\nSake/Shochu - 7/10, alcoholic japanese wine, once again, tried better and stronger ones myself. But they serve a pretty good variety(about 10?) of different sakes and shochu. Pretty reasonable prices for their size. 300ml of sake for 8 dollars, and a glass of shochu(premium barley) for the same price.\n\nDidnt get to try their sushi though, but the sashimi and the sake complimented the meal well enough. \n\nOn a whole, 2 bowls of udon, 1 plate of salmon sashimi(12 moderately thick slices) and 1 bottle of sake and 1 glass of shochu - a simple meal costs us about 30 per person.\n\nWill recommend it for those who are willing to splurge abit for japanese fare.

Whether you order sushi in its myriad forms, or one of the tempura dishes, it's all good.  The tofu in the soup is like custard.  \n\nAn order of chicken teriyaki, an order of tempura, and a serving of green tea ice cream, along with the complimentary noodle salad and green tea, cost us just under $30.  \n\nWe've been here before, and we'll be here again.

This place is owned and operated by a Japanese husband and wife (a rarity, am I right?)  The sushi chef is the husband , and in the kitchen the wife is cooking the food.  \n\nMy family has been coming here for years, and the wife always comes out of the kitchen to greet my parents when we eat here.  If you become regulars here, they'll definitely remember you and give you extra perks.\n\nMy favorite thing to eat at Tanuki is the noodle salad.  The noodle salad only comes with dinners, so if you don't order dinner, make sure to order it on the side.  That being said, I always order dinner, so I don't know too much about the sushi.  Although, my brother always orders sushi, so the raw fish must be good.  I usually stick to the chicken teriyaki.  Please note, the chicken teriyaki here is fried, not the usual grilled chicken though they do serve the grilled chicken teriyaki.  The Hamachi Kama is also exceptionally good; always nice and fatty.\n\nTanuki serves all your standard generic Japanese food, but they make it authentically, the right way.  I'd recommend ordering something off of the \"specials\" board, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe prices are a little bit expensive, but the portions are large and the flavors are always on point.", "author": "Anthony N."}

I told my partner that, if memory serves me right, I ate my very first sushi dinner here many, many years ago.  And even though I have not been back in a very long while, it's not been for lack of trying, since the opening hour for dinner here is a little later than when we usually like to start our dinner out.  However, since we were in  the area yesterday, my partner suggested we walk past to see if they're open for lunch.  I went along, full of skepticism.  Boy, was I so happily wrong!  We got there 20 minutes before the end of their lunch service but there were still about 1/2 dozen tables occupied and we were greeted warmly by 2 of their staff so we knew we can have our meal without feeling rushed.  I ordered their 4 (!) item bento lunch special: Tonkatsu, Sashimi, Tempura and what would have been Chicken Teriyaki but I was given a choice of whether I wanted the chicken grilled or fried and of course I have to go for fried.  All for $12!!   My favorite items are the fried chicken and the Tempura, both fried perfectly, the tempura batter was used lightly and has just the right amount of seasoning.  I also loved their noodle salad that came with the bento, leaving such a big impression with such a tiny portion.  Wish i can get that at other restaurants' bento offerings, sigh...

(yea yea i know we eat lots for 2 people...)  OMG they were ALL super delicious!  They didn't go cheap on the sashimi combo and gave us some of the unusual stuff like aji, bonito, mirugai, and scallops.  The kompachi, mmmmmm, is soooo extremely delicious and fresh!  The saba is best saba i ever tasted!  and the oyster and uni shot... you gotta try that out!!  \n\nAnyway, just go there and try it out.

I lived in Japan for years, eating everywhere from 100-yen conveyor-belt sushi places to wonderful, expensive holes in the wall, and I'm always apprehensive going out to eat sushi here in the U.S. because it tends to be worse than the former with the prices of the latter.  I was glad to find Tanuki in my neighborhood, and I would take anyone who likes sushi here--here's why.\n\nIf people like straight, traditional sushi, they won't be disappointed.  If they like American-syle rolls and novelties, they won't be disappointed either--the rolls are well made, with much better ingredients than you would normally get in a \"fusion\" style place; the uni shot was kind of incredible.  A good place to show California roll fans that real, simple sushi is different and can be better than something with 8 ingredients, two of them fried, topped with a mayonaise-based sauce.\n\nThe fish was fresh (especially the uni, which was obviously just-cleaned), the service was good, and everything was done right.  \n\nThey are Japanese and have Japanese customers--don't be fooled by the fact that you can get American-style sushi here.

I heard about this place from a girl friend because it's so rare to find places that have oyster shooters. Also read the yelp reviews and wanted to give it a try. Got here at about 7pm and parking was a bit difficult. There was a slight wait, but got seated fairly quickly and hot tea was brought to our table shortly after.\n\nWe ordered the oyster shooters, the bamboo roll, the spicy hamachi roll, the scallop roll and I also wanted an uni shooter. After the waitress took our order, she came back and said they were out of uni.. bummer. But I was still excited for the oyster shooters! I normally don't like sake in mine so I asked for no sake.\n\nNow this is why I'm deducting stars.. while everyone around us were seated after us, they kept getting our orders before us. But we were enjoying each others company so we compressed our tummies for a while longer anticipating our oyster shooters since that's the easiest order to make. Waited about 35 minutes before asking our waitress why it's taking so long while everyone else is getting their orders.. 5 minutes later she brings them out, but leaves before telling us which ones have sake and which ones don't. We wait for her to come back around to ask which ones are which and she looks puzzled and yells out at another waiter to see which ones are which. They all look at us as if we did something wrong and finally came back and told us that none of them have sake in them. Fine for me since that was what I originally wanted, but no apology of any kind to my friends who wanted sake in them. However, we let that slide.\n\nOnto the next part.. we waited over an hour for our 3 rolls while everyone was still getting their food before ours! And the rolls weren't even hot! It's as if they were just sitting in the back, just chillin' there.\n\nHowever, I enjoyed the oyster shooters and the scallop roll. Those two were my favorites, but I've had better. The spicy hamachi roll wasn't even spicy (and I don't have a high tolerance for spiciness) and the bamboo roll didn't have any kick to it.\n\nService definitely could've been better.

Service has definitely changed since Dec of '08. I guess it could also be an entirely different lineup of staff and an increase in business. \n3 out of 4 of the last times i've been to Tanuki started off very sour. Why? The service. Something about the servers here tells me that they don't know how to multi-task. Normally, i'd cut them a break and not be a bitch about shit but seriously this restaurant is not that big - it's very small. There's about 8 tables at most and 3 servers running around yet tonight it still somehow took TWENTY MINUTES to take my order?? \nAfter flagging down the servers, I had one waiter tell me \"just a minute\" 3x and the waitress told me \"i'll be right back\" twice. So in the timespan of twenty minutes, I was rejected FIVE TIMES. What went down those times? Other tables were cleared, food was taken out, and other tables' orders were taken. What the fuck man? Seriously?\nMy mom was remaining calm but I was ready to flip a table over and chop someone in the freaking babymaker. My mother tried to cut them some slack and said \"maybe this isn't the waiter's section\" I told her \"seriously mom, how big is this restaurant?\" So when the waitress rejected us, she started to crumble and snap.\nSo the twenty minutes went by and the male waiter finally took my order. Twenty minutes later, the first dish came out. So in total, it took 40 minutes until my family was able to take our first bites of food. My youngest brother was so hungry he fell asleep at the table. I shit you not. \nI can definitely say that this was not an isolated incident. \nThere was another time when a friend and I had gone and it took 30 minutes for our food to come. We'd flag down the waiter and he'd just say \"it's coming\" and walk off. \n\nWOW.\n\nDid you know that it's not really necessary to clear ONE MISO SOUP BOWL and walk it to the back? You can stop and take an order, swoop up the empty miso soup bowl and run the order afterwards? Seriously, you guys will cut down on walking back and forth a lot.. \nTanuki, your sushi is good but not THAT good. I'm definitely not frequenting this place as often...

The 14-piece combo plate with a huge variety ranging from tuna to salmon to mackerel to octapus to even sea urchin all served on top of fresh grated daikon. Delicious!\n\n2) Rainbow Roll, $15\n- Very very fresh and with a very unique combination of fish on top of the roll. (No avocado, but octapus!). Definitely on the pricier end though -- $15!\n\n3) Hamachi Roll (Special on menu), $12ish\n- Also very fresh, and a bit on the spicy side. \n\n4) Side: Fried Mackerel, $?\n- Fried  lightly to perfection! \n\n5) Side: Beef tounge, $?\n- Wow...never had it Japanese style (only lengua tacos)...super tender, charred so the edges are slightly crisped, and very savory.

It's a small, neighborhood spot, but the quality of the nigiri and sashimi is on par with any of Morimoto's pricey uptown joints. \n\nStaff is always friendly in the standard, almost overly polite way that you only experience in an authentic Japanese family restaurant. \n\nEverything was fresh and tasty. The uni was delicious. Hey, I realize that 'the custard of the sea' is an acquired taste, but don't be a pansy.

Small but not cramped place for a nice dinner among friends.  \n\nLet me start off by stating that this is a japanese owned establishment so I quickly look for certain entrees like futomaki which is the original roll usually consisting of japanese cucumber, egg, carrot, fish cake and kampyo. This one had crab too. Very nice! We also had negi hama as well. Equally good too.\n\nI had the uni (sea urchin) and ikura with azura (salmon roe and raw quail egg) because it's my fav. Not bad. The saba (mackeral) was excellent.\n\nHot dishes were the oyako don, tempura tenzaru soba and tempura udon. High praise for the udon texture and the all important broth...just right (not too salty or watery). The tempura batter was good too (not too thick and heavy). The oyaku don could've had more of a sweet flavor to it, but a very nice dish to have. A big plus was the chawan mushi (egg custard flavored with shitake mushrooms, shrimp and other cool ingredients). Excellent !\n\nAll in all, very good sushi/entrees with nice presentation as well as friendly japanese-english speaking wait service. The prices were very reasonable too with the portion size that you get as well! The only thing missing was the traditional vinegar rice flavor in the sushi rice which is something you don't see often anymore but is an expectation in a japanese owned sushi restaurant.

I sucked the tail just to get every last piece out. At Tanuki's they also serve the heads to you and they give you the option to have it either fried or in a broth. I of course had it fried and ate every edible part of the thing, eyes and all. Great great great. After trying amaebi here its become a staple of every Japanese dinner I go to.\n\nHere are other things to order:\n- Charashi - about 12 pieces of fish, tamago (egg), and mushrooms.

Then, when we ordered hamachi toro, it was clear they were running out of that. The ankimo we ordered was completely the wrong texture, and lacked flavor. \n\nThe toro we did consume was terrific. The hamachi toro, though slightly strangely cut, was also very good. \n\nFinally, and this is not really Tanuki's fault, but it is totally annoying: why can't servers learn to put the check in the middle of the table instead of in front of the dude?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-04", "description": "First time I came here was well over twenty years ago with my very first girlfriend.  Back then, it was a very reasonably priced, authentic Japanese restaurant that was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I quickly forgot about it. \n\nFast forward to the present day...I was able to jump a miraculous hurdle in the repair of one of my Corvettes and after some other good news, decided to go out to dinner.  Was going to go to Chou Chou, but had seen Tanuki on Yelp recently and decided to go there instead\n\nIt took some time after sitting down, but we finally got our menus.  Wow, what a difference the years make.  Was surprised at the high prices on the menu, but figured they went upscale and looked forward to some good food.  I ordered two large sakes, hamachi kama appetizer (grilled yellowtail collar...one of my Japanese faves), and a bunch of sushi.  My friend ordered Tempura with Prawns and as she ordered, asked the young waiter what kind of vegetables were in the tempura.\n\nThey were out of the large hamachi kama, so we got a small.  It was good, but not great.  Super salty in some spots and then no salt in others.  Personally, I like salty as that's authentic, but this one didn't impress.\n\nI was impressed with the freshness of the sushi there, especially the fresh salmon nigiri.  However, I was not impressed with the sake (smoked salmon) nigiri at all.  Not only was it multi-colored from reddish at the edges to an odd dull pale color in the center, it looked old and freezer burned.\n\nThe unakyu roll was excellent.  If only it had been just a touch smaller, it would have been perfect.  I admit that I often prefer value over authentic size, but in this case, it was an outside-in roll with rice on the outside.  As such, it was too big to eat in one bite, yet a messy pain to eat in two bites because of the nori on the inside of the rice.  Regardless, it was delicious.\n\nIt suddenly dawned on us that there were no prawns in her tempura.  We brought it to the attention of our waiter, a young guy who looked like he was waiting tables while in college.  He told us that no, Vegetable Tempura is what she ordered.  This obviously wasn't the case as there is no way in h#ll she would have ordered just vegetables, but we politely explained that she had ordered it with prawns so he went back to talk to the cook.\n\nAbout eight minutes later, he came out and told us that he could bring us an order of prawns, but would have to charge us for the separate order.  I nicely explained to him with a smile that she had not ordered Vegetable Tempura, but rather Tempura with Prawns (which includes vegetable).  My thought is why should we be penalized for HIS mistake?\n\nAfter that, he went back again.  This time, it felt like he was gone like fifteen minutes before he finally came back.  By then, I was pretty much through with my own meal yet we were still trying to get hers straightened out.  When he came back, he did not have an answer, but instead asked rather bluntly, \"So, what did you want to do?\"  I almost lost it and wanted to say, \"What do I want to do?...Hell, shouldn't that be what do YOU want to do?\"  Instead, I pulled out my rudimentary Japanese and told him that I can't understand what the problem is when she ordered Tempura with Prawns in the first place.  After that, he thought about it and then said Tempura with Prawns is $2.00 more than Vegetable Tempura.  I told him that's no problem since first of all, its only $2.00 and its what she ordered in the first place.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.\n\nFifteen to twenty minutes later (I'm not kidding, it seemed even longer), they finally brought out a small plate with two small, but perfectly fried prawns.  Not sure if that order usually comes with only two prawns (hard to imagine!), but at this point we were so tired of the whole ordeal that we didn't have the energy to say anything.\n\nObviously, there was a language issue, but I still feel like he was originally going to charge us not $2.00, but rather for a whole new order of tempura prawns to cover his mistake.  Also, I have to question the intelligence of the way the whole thing was handled.  A seasoned professional waiter would have instantly acknowledged that for whatever reason, the order had been miscommunicated and corrected it immediately.  The menu price difference should not even have been brought up as an issue nor should we have been told that they would have to charge us.  All they had to do was reflect the proper price of what we originally ordered on the final bill.  Regardless, I was generous and still tipped well.  Wondering why this morning.\n\nI was not impressed with the experience and felt that the place was also overpriced for a former family style restaurant with new upscale aspirations.  Way too many good Japanese restaurants in SF to suffer through this again.  At those prices, we should have just gone to Chou Chou for reasonable French like I originally intended.

We live across the bay but when we're in San Francisco we go to the same Japanese restaurant that will give you the best taste in Japanese cooking.  Somehow, I didn't feel like saying something good about this restaurant just so there would be no long line or long wait before they could seat you.  But, even after waiting long, you'll get satisfied after eating here.\n\nI was single then when my dad introduced me to this restaurant who is hooked on to this restaurant, first. Now,  I'm married I got my husband hooked on to this place.  He's favorite is their Chicken Teriyaki, used to liked their Nabeyaki Udon but when he tried their chicken teriyaki, he would not stop ordering the same.

It was nice that this place takes reservations for large groups too, b/c we had 10 people hungry and expecting good sushi.\n\nThis restaurant came through w/ some damn good sushi and fried teriyaki chicken (never had fried chicken before at a Japanese restaurant, but it was good, so no complaints).  Oh yea, like someone else mentioned in their review, it was a pleasant surprise to see a sushi restaurant w/ actual Japanese people working there (perhaps just seems to make a bit more authentic experience I suppose).\n\nWe ordered some fried calamari for starters, then had HELLA sushi rolls (rainbow rolls, spider rolls, dragon rolls, avocado rolls, etc.)  I got so freakin' stuffed from the food, I couldn't even finish all that we ordered.

My order was the combination sashimi and grilled teriyaki chicken.  The sashimi was excellent.  I didn't care much for the grilled chicken as it was a fairly thin piece of chicken which didn't have much kick in flavor.  Other members in my party ordered the fried teriyaki chicken, fried seafood, and tempura.  These items were fried to perfection; nice fried browned coloring and batter texture.

There used to be a cleaners next door and they bought the place and extended the restaurant out to it's present size. The sushi chef and his wife run the place and she has heard the wife likes to go betting on the horse races. The house on the corner had a fire and was gutted for several years so that side of the street looked kind of crummy but is now rebuilt.

Pretty simple, right? Well, if only more restaurants could get it right like Tanuki!\n\nThe first time, I was with a group of four. We had uni shots all around, which were delicious, and I thought the quality of sashimi and sushi rolls was great. But what brought me over to five star quality was service. The waiter/waitress who served and attended us were extremely friendly and helpful. They definitely checked up on us, which is something I'm not even that used to in restaurants anymore. They also kept refilling our tea and letting us sit and chat in the restaurant far after the restaurant had closed..and we didn't even notice, we were so comfortable. Haha, I feel bad - we made them pretty much wait there! But they were so friendly and personable nonetheless.\n\nThe other time I came with the bf and became even more of a fan after trying their oyster shots. I like restaurants with certain things that just.. make them special..give them that extra edge and unique personality. With Koo, my fave Japanese restaurant in the city, it's the Spoonfuls of Happiness, with Eiji, it's their amazing mochi, and with Sushi Bistro, it's their tremendous variety of rolls with crazy names. With Tanuki, I love their side menu - oyster shots, uni shots, lobster hand rolls...very nice. I also like the melted chocolate squares they give you at the end of the meal - far better than any gum or candy I've ever gotten on my bill, haha. The prices are honestly comparable and not overly expensive or too cheap - I expected this and have no complaints. The food and service are worth it, after all. \n\nOverall, I don't give five stars too often but the dining experience was simply wonderful and I will be coming back a lot!", "author": "Nebula H."}

I ordered Sake sashimi and a salmon skin roll. My friend ordered uni and some other dish. Was starving since I had not eaten breakfast or lunch...so anyways the food took FOREVER to come. When my sake sashimi (salmon) came...my friend and I looked at it. It was the ugliest sake I have ever seen! half of it was brownish grey...didnt look fresh at all! He ate the uni and said it wasnt fresh either. The salmon skin roll was \"okay\" ,,,ive had better. The food took forever to come...which was REALLY annoying. I mean how could you have only one sushi chef?? Makes no sense. After eating the sake and salmon skin roll I realized it wasn't enough and requested to get a vegetable tempura roll. Told one of the girl waitress's and 10, 15, 20 min goes by and still no food. The guy server came and asked if everything was ok but I told him that I was waiting on my roll.

It's a solid, authentic Japanese restaurant in the inner Richmond.  A great neighborhood restaurant that I wish were closer to my neighborhood.  For years they've consistently served great sushi at reasonable prices, surrounded by an extensive menu of traditional, if not particularly exotic dishes.\n\nA few recommendations:  Rolls are particularly good here, including the Tanuki (fried shrimp, eel, marinated eggplant, and avocado), the Bamboo (white tuna and cucumber, with salmon, green onion, and white tuna topping), and numerous vegetable rolls.  They also do a great hirame nigiri.  In the non-sushi category, the sea bass is succulent and cooked perfectly.  Lots of sake choices, which is great.

Agedashi is lightly browned fried tofu with a crunchy shell on the outside and the softest tofu on the inside. The dish is served HOT in a light broth, accompanied by green onion and grated daikon that melts in your mouth. You should definitely eat it first when it is still warm, but be careful not to burn your tongue! =) The proportion is perfect for an appetizer or light snack if you're not too hungry.  \n\nThe rolls and other appetizers are also good.  I can't remember what they're called but one of the Sushi rolls with Salmon skin is quite tasty! But all the dishes are all finely-prepared from the green onion toppings to the grated daikon.\n\nI've always received the best service here; but I may be biased bc the restaurant is in love with one of my closest friends that always takes me here. =) But still, the servers are really sweet and the owner is always welcoming to new guests.  \n\nI love the atmosphere! Tanuki is a cozy place with an ambient feel. Very clean and nicely constructed but not too pretentious either. Although Tanuki is across the bay from my neighborhood, it is a nice \"neighborhood\" restaurant that I will be coming back to, very frequently.\n\nI'd give 5 stars but I'd be biased bc of the special treatment my friend and I receive =)", "author": "Becka T."}

He will remember you if you come more than once.   He may even remember your likes and dislikes.  Unlike the joint on Balboa he is not a sushi nazi, but has decent fish. \n\nIs this the bomtastic sushi, Spanks?  Nope.  It is by all means OK sushi.  Very OK sushi.  But the draw is the price to quality ratio. ON average the cost is about $20 per person.  For the same amount of money at some of SF\"s \"TOP\" sushi places this would be for 1/4 of 1 person. \n\nOK for Sushi foodies in the area.  For Sushi Nuts like myself with excessively high Sushi standards, it is worth it if you are passing by and happen to be hungry , primarily because the alternatives, Chin sushi and Sushi Boat are absolutley disgusting.\n\nYou may want to take note however, that yelpers have granted 4 stars to Chin sushi across the street which is light years below Tanuki in quality.

It was tough to decide which place to try since there's about 3 places within 10 ft. of each other on this block. Fish was ok, but the vegetable combo and veggie rolls were great. The chefs behind the bar looked like they were having a good time and had a couple shots of sake with the sushi bar dwellers which was fun. \n\nI like creative, non-traditional rolls, which they had a few of, but nothing too special. The Tokyo roll (salmon, tuna & avocado) roll was average. I did enjoy the straight avocado roll (simple, but very fresh) and the grilled eggplant nigiri - nice presentation and good flavor. \n\nOrdered a bottle of cold sake, not too sweet and not too dry, which was nice--they have a couple selections with a good range. The sake, two bottles of Asahi, the veggie combo, the avocado roll and Tokyo roll totaled $40 which was definitely reasonable. \n\nOverall wasn't incredibly wowed by anything here...would probably try the other two places on this block before returning.", "author": "Kelly R."}

It has been doing business at it's location for over 30 years, and I certainly will continue to do my raw fish eating business there.  Whenever I have guests in town who wish for sushi, I bring them to Tanuki or to Ryoko's, but mainly Tanuki, which we can walk to from my flat.\n\nAki, the main sushi chef, I've known since the first time I walked into the spot.  He loves baseball, golf, and drinking.  Not as much as the fellow working Oyaji, but nearly as much.  Andre, the other chef, is friendly and mellow.  The older woman in the back, Aki's wife and Andre's mother, is a good izakaya cooking chef.  The table staff are diligent, with the exception of prime dinner time week-ends, when it gets bum rushed by patrons.  Tanuki could use extra help Friday and Saturday nights for sure.\n\nI enjoy their chawan mushi and their grilled squid.  It's always comfort to have a small bowl of the chawan mushi on foggy nights.  Warms the belly nicely.  Sashimi is my preference, and they have good fish here.  They also have good izakaya dishes made in the kitchen behind the bar that aren't necessarily on the menu.  The one favorite item that Tanuki always gets right on are the oyster shots.  They rock my world!  Before I even sit down, I order them up.

Lovely sushi rolls [please, do not go here if you're going to order a cucumber roll], especially the lobster hand roll. My favorites are the savory, juicy oyster shooters [no alcohol in these] and chicken teriyaki---but before you think \"how unoriginal!\", this ain't your usual boneless, skinless chicken teriyaki in a bento box with salad and rice from any japanese restaurant, Tanuki's chicken teriyaki is cut up pieces of delicious fried chicken [GOOD sized pieces with skin and bone-on] with a tasty crispy batter drizzled with teriyaki sauce.", "author": "kristin e."}

The dinner came with tuna, white tuna, salmon and hamachi. All good. All fresh. All melts in my mouth and not in my hands.\nHot Sake - Of course, it is not a true japanese meal without some hot sake. The small only gets about 3 shots, but 1.5 shots each was good enough for a dinner.\nI will have to come here a lot more since it is so close to home.", "author": "Jimmy N."}

Nigiri was sized just right, and not Texas big. On a weeknight, it was wonderfully calm and quiet. Service was therefore quite attentive without being suffocating. Calm and chill, with freshness obvious - a solid choice.", "author": "Lemon S."}

My husband and I really enjoyed everything on our first visit: the food, the service, the atmosphere, the generous portion, and reasonable price.  The Hamachi Kama was grilled and seasoned to perfection.  The only item we didn't care for too much was the Ahi Poke roll which was a little plain and ordinary.  Still, I can't wait to come back here and introduce Tanuki to my dad, who has a great taste for Japanese cuisine", "author": "Nadine M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-03-09", "description": "it was ok...that's really all i can say.  nigiri pieces were not well cut and definitely not as fresh as they could be.  it really was hit or miss w/the rolls too...some were great, i would stick with the spicy hamachi rolls but some were pretty boring and looked like you could have gotten it out of a ready pack at the grocery store.  service was friendly and fast, prices were decent but i will probably never go back...there are way too many better sushi places out there.", "author": "Janet K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-12", "description": "Most of my favorite Sushi places seem to be closed on a Monday, so I went on Yelp for some research. This place looked interesting and looked worthy of a punt. And boy was I happy with the choice! The albacore melted on my tongue, the lobster hand roll special was very reasonable and delicious, and so was pretty much everything else. Add to that a friendly and very Japanese sushi chef who must have thought we looked like ankimo fans (he was right). Out of the goodness of his heart (I guess?) he handed us a delicious plate of ankimo and mushrooms. It was grilled with a delicate ponzu sauce over it, paired with shavings of red and green onion. Will definitely go back.", "author": "Don J."}
