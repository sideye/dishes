The food was disappointing tho - chicken karage lacked flavor and had a lot of breading. It didn't have the crunch I was hoping for since it's supposed to be like popcorn chicken. I got the dragon roll which was also bland and tasted a little dry. The avocado on top didn't look too good and I barely tasted the eel. My friend got the sashimi dinner plate and I tried a little bit of the salmon, it was not bad. Their raw options seem to be better than the cooked food.\n\nService was okay, not super attentive and it took a while for them to get us the check. \n\nIt's a hip spot with dim ambiance & loud music and mediocre food.", "author": "Ying Z."}

That's also because we arrived after a movie around 10pm and I heart it's quite busy earlier. Not a lot of space for groups larger than 3, it's easy to find a table with 2.\n\nRyoko's is a lively sushi bar, it's sort of underground and has this bit of grungy vibe. I went with 4 people and we shared 4 different sushi rolls at various price points. It came out to around $12 per person, even though it seems cheap the rolls were a bit expensive. The rolls were pretty small though and we were satisfied but not close to full. We tried the sexy, pokemon, crunchy crab and spicy golden gate roll.\n\nMy favorite was the sexy roll it's a baked roll with salmon and cheese, even though I find cheese kind of gimmicky sometimes, it actually turned out well! The other roll I liked was the crunchy crab roll.\n\nIt took us a while to be seated, but the food came out of pretty fast.\n\nThe rolls were decent!

That being said our server was very kind and flexible. The cold sake was particularly good. For food I got a hamachi and sake nigiri which was decent but not exceptional. I ordered a spicy tuna roll with blue fin tuna which was truly exceptional. They have a system where they will increase the price on a roll if the fish that day if very good quality. I ended up paying $10.50 for a roll that was priced at $7. I definitely thought the fish was worth the price and the other nigiri which was not as good was charged as advertised.

I'm pretty sure I dreamed about it too! \n\nCame with a group of 4 and we were ready to do work! The sashimi dinner here was sooo good. It came with salmon, yellowtail, saba, shrimp, scallop, and tuna. 2- 3 substantial slice of each! It is also served with miso soup. \n\nAlthough it's not on their menu, we got the hamachi kama. THIS WAS THE BEST. EVER. It was my first time having this in general and my mind was blown. Trust me, you gotta try this one here. The meat is so soft and just melts in your mouth! AAahhh I already want more. :P \n\nToro here was also amazing. We got 2 servings (2 pieces per serving) and loved it so much that we ordered another one right away! It just melts away in your mouth. Seriously amazing. \n\nWe also got 3 rolls to share: volcano roll, 49ers roll, and rainbow roll. We ordered the volcano roll because it sounded super interesting since it has peanut butter in it. We decided to give it a try anyway, and I actually really liked it. The peanut butter created a unique flavor combo with the shrimp tempura and jalapeno. Rainbow roll and 49ers roll were good as well.\n\nI also really liked the ambiance here. Low light and underground. There are 2 TVs here as well if you're not tryna miss a game.

They have a live DJ playing music in the restaurant. We walked in and down the stairs to place our name in the wait list that hangs on the left. It's not super clear to do that but we knew because of yelp but I saw a few parties that were annoyed when no one greeted them. They could benefit from having a sign at the bottom of the stairs to direct them to do that as often people stood in front of the wait list. \n\nWe probably waited 15-20min for a table and once we were seated it probably took just as long for someone to bring us water/take our water. We ordered the chicken karrage, rainbow, jumping unagi, big mama and dragon rolls. The chicken karrage came out a few minutes after our order. Then the jumping unagi and dragon rolls a few minutes after that. And then the rainbow roll last. You would expect the rainbow roll to come out first because they don't have to dry anything. I just found it so strange that I got my food quicker than it took for a waitress to come to my table!\n\nThe chicken karrage was okay. It's fried chicken. The batter was light and it wasn't anything special. \n\nThe jumping unagi was good but I wish it didn't come as one of the first rolls because it is so filling because of the fried tempura. I think this roll could have benefited from less batter. It was a bit much. \n\nThe big mama was okay. I ordered it because I thought it was unique but it was too spicy for my taste. It overpowered everything else on that roll. \n\nThe dragon roll was my favorite, by far. You could tell all the ingredients from the roll was fresh. It was probably the best dragon roll I've had. Everything from the fish, rice, seaweed and avocado was perfect!\n\nThe rainbow roll was equally as fresh and delicious as the dragon roll. \n\nI honestly would give this 4 stars if the service was better. The long wait to order was a bit ridiculous but it took even longer to get the check. JUST LET ME LEAVE SO YOU CAN TURNOVER THE TABLE TO PEOPLE LEAVING.

Luckily Ryoko's was right around the corner. It's an interesting set up, as the restaurant is in the basement, which isn't too common in SF. The music blaring loudly over the speakers was all top 40s / pop; I remember hearing Party in the USA come on at one point, which marks the first time I've ever heard that at a restaurant. But I digress...\n\nWe came on a Monday night a little after 9:30, and the place was popping. There was barely an empty table in sight! I was shocked. There were a handful of groups there, but Ryoko's sweet spot is really as a late night date spot. Everywhere we looked, we saw couples on dates. The dim lighting and the blaring music must help foster this environment...\n\nWe weren't too hungry, so we opted to share their sashimi dinner and a caterpillar roll. The sashimi set comes with 14 pieces and was quite underwhelming. For us, it included four pieces of salmon, three tuna, three yellowtail, three cooked octupus, and one piece of shrimp. Nothing tasted particularly fresh, and I couldn't believe this one tiny platter of mediocre sashimi set us back $40. The caterpillar roll ($14) was good, but it's a hard roll to screw up.\n\nMy friend and I agreed, we definitely won't be coming back here again.", "author": "Dianna H."}

My party of 5 got there around 6:20pm on a Saturday, just a little after they opened. It was already completely packed, but thankfully we were at the front of the line and waited no more than 20 minutes to be seated. While we waited, we were able to order drinks from the bar and jam to edm. Untz untz untz!\n\nAfter we ordered, our food came within 15-20 minutes. My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls. The rolls were small and just okay. The jumping tuna is deep fried and comes with sweet chili sauce. The 49ers is what you would expect. The sexy reminds me of lion king roll. It was tasty but the salmon was a bit dry and overcooked. And for some reason, we were charged extra for 2 rolls. We were charged $12 for jumping tuna and $15.80 for 49ers, when it said $9 and $13.50, respectively, on the menu. Too bad I didn't notice this at the restaurant, so make sure you guys check your bill before paying! Thankfully their beer pints and pitchers were decently priced. We all had about 3 glasses each for $10.50 per person. Yay for inexpensive alcohol!\n\nFood was average, but service and atmosphere were great. Even though it was super crackin' in there, the staff was attentive and efficient. I had a good time!\n\nP.S. Congrats to 49ers on their first win of the season lul", "author": "Lincy H."}

I spent the day being a tour guide for people from out of the state, so we stumbled upon Ryoko's per chance. It was still around 5:30, but there was already a line. Really, you have to expect that of any place in the City that's popular.\n\nOnce you get in, it feels like you've won a small lottery prize! You go downstairs and sit at one of the small tables in this loungey looking place. With a deep house playlist playing, I felt as if I was about to pregame before going to some concert (perhaps another time). Really a vibe that you can't find in other parts of the country. Yes, I was finally home in the Bay.\n\nThe menu is pretty basic with not a lot of frills (which I appreciate). I get the rainbow roll since it gets me as much fresh fish as possible in one roll. Sorry I didn't get photos...the company with me didn't want to wait for my foodie tendencies. The quality of the fish was good, substantial. Nothing too unique or unconventional, so I wouldn't call it a gem so much as a solid sushi spot. I don't think it's worth a long wait, but if you happen to get a seat quickly, it's satisfying enough. I did get a photo of our dessert: mochi ice cream. Yum!", "author": "Ellyse L."}

There were tons of places to choose from but several were closed on Mondays... but not this one!! We found it quickly on Yelp and it was even in walking distance. Score!\n\nWe arrived at the front door and made our way downstairs. It was very lively with fun music on and the place was packed. It had somewhat of a grunge feel to it and I was intrigued. We were lucky enough to grab a table right before a giant group walked in. The table was really small, honestly only big enough for two people but we made it work. It did take some time before a server came over and took our drink order but we were lost in good company so it wasn't too bad. While my friends ordered a sake bomb, I opted for just water and food. I was starving after being on a plane all day long and I was ready to chow down.  We eventually ordered a variety of different rolls as well as a tempura appetizer. After waiting a good bit for our food to arrive, we dove right in, eating every bite of food on the table. Like I mentioned before, we were all hungry af! I feel like we should have ordered more though. For spending about $30 on sushi alone (remember I didn't get a drink) and not feeling full, I was a little bummed. \n\nOverall, this spot was just ok. The service was slow and the food was average so I'm not 100% sold on visiting again on my next trip to SF. I suppose it worked for my friends and I at the time and that's all that matters.

As far as sushi places go, I'm surprised this place is still open. Probably because the people in San Fran have no choice but to get used to the abominable service and the atrocious conditions this place and the city presents. \n\nFirst i had to put my own name on the waiting list because their hostess is all over the place. Lack or organizational skill is rampant in this establishment. Then, my date and i were sat in a table that had no suitable chair, just a rinky dink stool that looked like it was brought out from the bathroom. To add insult to injury, our table was next to the restroom which smelled like a porta potty was shoved in there and left open for all to smell. \n\nI decided to request for a better chair and the waitress told me \"no\" with a lazy, snobby attitude. I was glad someone stepped in and told her yes to get me something better. I should not have to wait to get into a debate before i get such a simple request taken cared of. In the end, i decide to switch tables. And continued to give them a shot. To my disbelieve, it only got worse, by my standards. I think this place has an unbelievable lack of standards. \n\nI have had sushi across the country and across the world when i travel. They don't stand a chance next to any place I've been to. The food was mediocre at best. The shrimp and bacon was oily, unnecessary and looked more like an experiment than a well thought out appetizer. The sushi rolls were ok at best, definitely not worth paying what they charge. I rather pay more for quality. The nigori that was brought out was weak at best, so many nigori options to choose from and they went with that. I recommend they change that menu option. There are better in the world.\n\nThe customer service was atrocious,  the servers looked like they were running all over the place like chickens with their heads cut off. \n\nThe interior design was non-existent, the bright worn out blue on the walls looked like it was hidden under layers of wall paper before it was exposed, so you see what looks like tape getting torn off the walls. If that was meant for a design, they need to hire a new designer. The place looked messy and cluttered, smelled messy and cluttered too. The materials that make up the interior design look worn and torn. They should reinvest into this place an get abetter interior designer. \n\nI don't plan on stepping foot in this place again. Looks like the city that surrounds it. Messy, dirty and unorganized.", "author": "Angel R."}

It is in a basement and it does not have the prettiest decor, but the food is incredible and the service is above expectation in every way!\n\nI decided to go to Ryoko's during my business trip. I know there is always a line at Ryoko's, but I  figured it would be easier to get a seat for one person.  It was a Tuesday night and there was a pretty good line of people when I got there around 7:30pm. Luckily, the line moved pretty quick. I think it is fantastic that I can order and drink beer while waiting.  Since I was by myself, I was seated at the sushi bar within 20 minutes.  While I was waiting, the hostess kept us informed of the wait time. Even though she was so busy running around trying to manage the seating situation, she was always pleasant and helpful (I don't know how she does it...)\n\nFor dinner, I ordered (Santa Barbara) uni, tuna tataki, ikura, ama-ebi, chu toro and hamachi toro. Uni was delicious as usual, sweet and creamy. Tuna tataki was seared and seasoned to perfection; just the right amount of shredded onions and sunflower sprouts in a bed of ponzu sauce. Ama-ebi was sweet and plump; the shrimp heads were deep fried and seasoned with the right amount of sea salt. Ikura nigiri was fantastic; the eggs were salted just right and the ratio of Ikura to rice was perfection. Chu toro simply melted in my mouth; it was heavenly. While I was enjoying my chu toro, the waitress regrettably informed me that hamachi toro were sold out for the night.  I was disappointed, but fortunately, I was distracted by how good the food was; I got over it pretty quickly!\n\nRyoko's did not disappoint.

Fifteen minutes later, we were seated (party of two).\n\nAs we went through the menu, red flags started popping up all over. There's a signature roll with peanut butter and a LOT of rolls on the menu with imitation crab, mayonnaise, and/or cream cheese. \n\nWe ended up getting agedashi tofu, the tuna yukke, jumping unagi roll, hamachi kama, and one other roll that was so underwhelming that I can't even remember what it was or what was in it. I do remember that we didn't finish it.\n\nSo the tuna yukke is described as tuna in spicy sesame oil, garlic, ginger, sea salt sauce with shiso and is served with seaweed. It's served at market price, which we found out was $33 when the waiter took our order. We figured for $33 it must be amazing, so we went ahead and ordered it. IT WAS NOT GOOD. Really not good. Not $33 good, not $3 good. The ingredients don't go well together and it tastes like bland mush. \n\nThe jumping unagi roll is deep fried and it's weirdly carb-y. Now, I love deep fried things, but it wasn't nice and crispy as one would expect. Once you bite into a piece, the rice gets overwhlemingly heavy and it was a bit sickening. I ended up eating the filling and leaving the rice and fried shell. \n\nOh also, it took around 40 minutes to get our check. Why.\n\nKind of glad I went so that any desire to try this place is now long gone, but so disappointed by how terrible it was. Almost wish the wait was long that day so that I would never have had the opportunity to waste time and money on crap food.", "author": "Kimberly O."}

Yay!\n\nFor starter, we had some fried oysters along with nigiri and sushi rolls. All were decent, but I wouldn't say it's the best sushi rolls I ever had. The nigiri was alright, but I quite honestly didn't think it was all that fresh. \n\nService was quick and fast. This is no high end sushi, but a casual sushi joint for a quick bite. \nIf you want better quality sushi and better value, head to South Bay for the experience.", "author": "Owie N."}

The blue painted walls makes the place look closed in. The paintings on the wall aren't cohesive. And it's suuuuper crowded. There's a live DJ which I thought was cool. There's no waiting area other than the staircase at the front and outside on the sidewalk. \n\nI say this place was alright maybe cuhz of what we ordered but  most of the rolls on the menu have the same ingredients with one additional different ingredient. (Check the menu, you'll know what I mean). Most of the rolls are kinda cheap. You can get them $5-$9/per roll. \n\nFor starters, I really liked the fried soft shell crab and the fried oysters. The breading was light and not greasy. It came with two choices of sauce which is a plus. \n\nWe ordered the Caterpillar roll with the cheese and after a while, the cheese hardens so it kinda gets chewy. We also ordered the Checkerboard and Dragon roll. The dragon roll is pretty safe, nothing bizarre if you like sashimi. Idk why anyone orders eel, it's so bony. Now I know not to order that anywhere else.\n\nFor a Friday night, it took us an hour to find parking and an hour wait time. So nope; I didn't think it was worth it. On the plus side, the servers are really nice.", "author": "Janine P."}

The restaurant atmosphere was fine with me, but if you're with older people, they won't enjoy it; the restaurant is dark and you will have to sit very close with other people. There's also rap and hip hop music playing loudly so it's hard to talk and engage in conversation. The restaurant was packed and again the sushi was veryyy good, but the atmosphere was not for me.

It's overpriced. $40 for sushi/sashimi dinners for some of the most basic provisions of fish. Two of the nine pieces of the sushi dinner was the same lean cut of maguro tuna - one of the most underwhelming things ever. If I had to price the fish that was served in both sushi and sashimi plates, the total should not have come out to more than $20 - seriously some of the most inflated prices I've ever had to eat. \n\nI've traveled across the country and borders to taste some good quality, freshly served sushi and sashimi and I've got to say Ryoko has just not provided the experience that the current ratings reflect. Ended up paying a little over $100 with tip and tax and I felt slightly ripped off and disappointed. \n\nSome of the reviews here claim it is good value -- I say, if you are willing to \ndrop at least $40 for a plate of sushi here, you should take that money and go elsewhere to get a better bang for your buck. \n\nI've got to say that the only thing that possibly redeems this place is the tamago and good service. Good tamago nigiri and very warm, friendly, and attentive staff.", "author": "David Y."}

And yet, the place was packed when we came for dinner on a Saturday. This restaurant only offers small plates and sushi rolls/nigiri, but their takes on these dishes are slightly unusual and worth a try!\n\nMy group started with the Japanese octopus over seaweed salad and the chicken karaage small plates. The karaage was surprisingly good--I'm usually not the biggest fan of fried chicken, but the large chunks of chicken were surprisingly juicy, tender, and flavorful! We also had the grilled saba (mackerel), and you can't really go wrong with that. \n\nThen we shared a bunch of rolls--the pokemon roll was wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed and came with plenty of fresh fish. The dragon roll was wrapped in unagi and avocado, the 49er was topped with bluefin tuna/salmon, and the jumping tuna was a delicious and creative deep-fried roll stuffed with spicy tuna and served with a sweet/spicy sauce on the side. Nice! The only disappointing roll I had was the spicy scallop, from which I got a strong hit of soy sauce/salt. Other than that, all of these rolls were creative, tasty, and delicious!\n\nWhile pricey, the food at Ryoko's is worth a try, though don't expect much from the dingy atmosphere.

Overall this place is awful. Mediocre sushi presented in lackluster fashion in an overcrowded, cramped space with blaring music honestly doesn't equate to a good dining experience. Throw in disorganized service and tables that seem \"sticky\" and you end up wishing you had gone to McDonald's for a Filet of Fish instead. The sushi rolls we ordered were either so salty they were bitter; or so bland they tasted watery. You can't speak in a normal tone of voice here; you either scream at each other or you aren't heard.

They were all pretty good but none of them really stood out to me. The jumping unagi roll (deep fried unagi roll) and spicy scallop roll were both tasty. I was actually pleasantly surprised at how big the scallop was in the scallop roll. I also ordered the amaebi (sweet shrimp nigiri + fried shrimp heads), which was okay here.

The food, on the other hand, was a dream and anything I coulda asked for after a long day. Between me and 2 other friends, we got a carafe of sake (it was really smooth and kinda sweet - I totally forgot the name of it but it was $18 and reallllyyyy good!). The prices were actually kinda expensive - it was 6 pieces for $9? But literally every penny spent was worth it. We got the jumping california and the jumping unagi - I think the jumping part means the outside isn't just rice but is fried. It was literally cooked at the perfect temp where the inside of the sushi was warm but not mushy. \n\nMy favvvvv part of the meal was their deep fried oyster! I'm not normally a fan of oyster, but holy shit.. this was soooooo amazingly creamy and everything just melted together. Truly one of the small peaks of my life. Would totally get it again.

When I come out to visit the coast, I want to make sure that this is how experience fish when I get sushi or sashimi, because living inland you just don't get this kind of experience. My friend and I were lucky there happened to be two spots open at the bar, and right after we sat it seemed like a crowd packed in. The restaurant is down a level from the street, and it's dark, yet bustling and energetic inside. We ordered a few sashimi and some sushi rolls. We had the mackerel and some smoked salmon sashimi, and I can't recommend the smoked salmon more. Make sure everyone you're with gets a chance to try it. We ordered the Sakepper, Jumping California, 49er, Checkerboard, and Rainbow rolls. The rice is very fresh, the flavors were great, and as I said before, the fish falls apart in your mouth. The rainbow roll is probably my favorite, but it was also one of the most expensive. There are plenty of rolls to choose from if that's the route you want to go, and there are cheaper rolls, and more expensive ones. if I get the chance, I'll definitely be coming back to try more.

Nigiri are fresh- comes with good amount of rice, price can range from $4.50- $22.00 for seasonal or toro's. My favorites are: salmon toro takaki, hamachi toro, and otoro roll.

Well, the other day was just that. After passing Union Square on my way home, I decided to take a different route and find a place I've never been too, eventually stumbling into Ryoko's.\n\nIrasshaimase! That's the welcome greeting you hear as you open the door. Everyone in the restaurants yells it from the top of their lungs as you walk down the stairs into their main restaurant area. There's a small host stand with someone waiting, lots of table seating and sushi bar seating. I think there's also upstairs seating as I saw a staircase but at 6pm, no one in the restaurant so everyone was sat in the bottom area. I think overall, the staff is super efficient and cordial. One thing that got a little annoying was irasshaimase chant. It was for everyone, and I get that, however they yell it loud and if you're at the sushi bar, it's piercing. There were 3 sushi chefs in a small sushi bar area so sound traveled a ton. \n\nThe menu was not overwhelming at all. It's mostly sushi. You'll have a specials board and some appetizers but what you wont find is a dinner menu filled with items such as rice bowls (except for chiraishi and similar). I like that. Focus on a few things and perfect what you have. On the specials menu, they offer the expensive fish. Mostly from Japan. My server Patty was hardcore with trying to upsell the specials. She almost didn't give me an option on the type of fish. For instance, I asked her for salmon nigiri from the menu. She instead suggested the Toki Salmon toro on the specials menu for almost doubled the price but said it in a way that really wasn't an option. \"Ok sake toro is ok, yeah?\" I had to stick to my guns and say no and that I'll just take the sake on the menu. It happened a couple of times; laughable but still a little too much. Speaking of food here's what I got: \n\n-Kai Miso Soup for $4.50. I started with this winner: you average miso soup with clams! I've had a similar dish at another restaurant and loved the element of clams, so this was great. \n\n-Sake (Salmon) nigiri for $6.00 and order (2 pieces to an order). I highly recommend just getting this salmon as opposed to the specials for $12.80 an order. This sake was buttery, melting in my mouth and didn't come with an overbearing fish flavor. I got 4 orders of this so 8 pieces later, I was treated to a great meal! Loved it. I also love that they shave their own wasabi! It was a great element and really made a difference\n\n-Chu Toro (Fatty Tuna) nigiri for $16.80 an order. So this was one I didn't want to skimp on. I love fatty tuna. When I got the nigiri, it didn't look like other toro nigiris I've received. It was darker in color but OH-EM-GEE, it tasted exactly like a great Toro! This was buttery than the sake. I love how the sushi chefs really highlight the fish and not overpower the dish with lots of rice, just enough to enhance. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\n-Salmon skin roll for $7.00. Grilled salmon skin, shiso peppers, cucumber, burdock root and flying fish roe served with bonito flakes and mayo. It came with 5 pieces and it was good. At first, looked like your average maki sushi, the elements were there and worked well together. Not the biggest stand out but good overall.\n\nWhat a great treat. I didn't feel overly full afterwards. I was content with the fresh fish and great flavors every bite offered. Ryoko's will definitely happen again for me! Go check them out.", "author": "Rockne H."}

We topped the meal off with mochi ice cream, which was really delicious. Highly recommend the mango flavor, it was sweet and refreshing. The skin of the mochi is also quite thick, so you get extra chewy goodness. \n\nWould come back and retry my favorites, and try other appealing rolls!", "author": "Ke C."}

Honestly the only thing that stood out was the cut of the salmon. It was really fatty so there was a lot of taste to it. However, the rolls were the biggest disappointment of our meal. We got the Pokemon, 49ers, Spicy Golden Gate, and Dragon rolls. Do NOT get the Pokemon roll. You pay $10+ for four pieces of loosely rolled rice balls. Out of all the rolls the dragon roll was the best, but it wasn't amazing.

Definitely a hole in the wall kinda place, but didn't smell weird and had a cool vibe on the inside (modern music set to edm). Service was also very average. We started with the tempura which was very good, but only two shrimp and vegetables, all lightly fried and super crispy! We then had 2 orders of the salmon nigiri (melt in your mouth), yellow tail nigiri, red tuna roll, salmon skin roll, yellow tail roll, and the dragon roll. Everything was amazing! My personal favorite was the salmon skin roll, chalked full of flavor. My boyfriend preferred the dragon roll because the eel was so tasty. HOWEVER, make sure you get here early.

BUT if you're looking for a place w/ a fun time and some GREAT sushi, then this is the place to go! The reason my family and I were able to get a spot was b/c we got there right before it opened, and thankfully the line wasn't too long, so we were able to be seated within 10-15 minutes. \n\nThere's a small private parking lot next to the restaurant, but you have to pay about $20 for valet parking. There's also street parking available, but if you're not used to parking on hills or driving in SF in general, then I would just bite the bullet and do the valet. \n\nLet's talk about the food now. The choices are countless! Since there were 5 of us eating, we just ordered a bunch of rolls, some sake, and split accordingly. \n\nThey sell fried shrimp heads! a rule of thumb from my dad -- you know a sushi place is pretty legit if they sell that here (i'm not sure what the japanese word for it is, but if a place has this, you gotta have it!) It's a crunchy, savory, briny bite that accompanies the meal well. \n\nThey have your classic roll combinations, like Philadelphia and California, but they also have some unique rolls (pretty sure one of them had peanut butter in them, sounds weird, but trust me, it was delicious!) The quality of their raw fish was great - you can tell the fish was fresh and well maintained b/c it didn't smell fishy and the textures of each respective fish was nice and firm. \n\nI'm not too familiar with the other sushi options in SF, but I highly recommend this one!", "author": "Erica K."}

I haven't been in a couple of years, but after Yelp-checking it was a gamble and risk I was willing to take.\n\nUnfortunately I had to take the L on this one.\n\nFOOD:  We ordered the sashimi dinner platter and a few sushi rolls to share.  Overall, the sushi quality was poor.  The sashimi platter was pretty pathetic - small, whimpy pieces; the texture was bad, you could tell it wasn't fresh.  And the fish itself was warm (ew!).  Menu said it was a 14 piece platter but they cut normal sized sashimi in two pieces, so you get half the amount, basically seven pieces... really?!  The sushi rolls were a bit better, probably because of the sauce it was doused in.  The rolls themselves never held because the rice kept falling apart, so instead of eating a sushi roll we were eating piles of what was supposed to be sushi.  Not to mention, the price was higher than normal for what you get.\n\nATMOSPHERE:  When we were seated, the music was at a decent level and you could carry a conversation easily -- totally A-OK with that.  Music selection was fun; they played top 40s pop, edm and rap music.  I'm not sure when or why, but at some point later in our meal the music was BLASTING.  And I don't have sensitive ears, for reference I take SoulCycle weekly so I know what loud music is and this was unbearably loud.  I felt myself screaming at the person next to me.  If you want to go to a dinner where you can only read lips and listen to loud music, this is the spot for you!\n\nTo top it off, once they cleared the table, they immediately dropped our check off without us asking for it.  Granted, some people like the immediacy so they can get on their way, but we felt very rushed just as we felt they rushed making our food.\n\nAll things considered, if you're paying a high price for the amount and quality of food you get - not to mention losing an eardrum for an evening, I would continue your SF sushi hunt and dine elsewhere.", "author": "Sharene B."}

I wasn't much impressed by the atmosphere it was decorated kind of odd and felt super cramped. We started with the pitcher of my favorite beer, Sapporo and some edamame. The edamame was ok. I usually like it to be salted but these were unfortunately plain Jane.

The wait is long, and the waiting area is weird but its definitely worth it. \n\nThe sashimi was very fresh, I would order one of the nigiri or sashimi dinners next time just to try more variety. We got the jumping tuna roll and the crunchy crab roll and both were awesome! The prices were on par with other sushi places and it was overall a really good experience. \n\nFYI most of the tables are for 2 so I think the wait could be even longer with more than 2, plus its dark and kind of cramped inside so I wouldn't recommend for groups.", "author": "Chelsea J."}

I was warned from Yelpers that the portion sizes are on the smaller side, but I still wasn't prepared for how small it actually was! We ordered 4 rolls (orange delight, hot tuna, hamachi and I think alcatraz) and an appetizer (octopus) between 4 people and I doubt that the plates that showed up would even have fed 2 :( \n\nBesides the beef with the portion sizes, I did like how the sushi quality and taste. The hot tuna had this interesting hint of cumin in it but I'm pretty sure there wasn't any. Orange delight was really fresh. I also liked the octopus -- it had a nice grilled flavor and came on a bed of spring mix. \n\nAmbiance: As my friend put it, \"not stuffy\", and I agree. This is a good place to kick back after a long day walking around the city.

I asked for a counter seat for one in Japanese, and then repeated myself in English when told by the host they don't speak Japanese. \n\nAt the counter, I asked in Japanese what was fresh and recommended. Neither the sushi chef, nor the rest of the staff I interacted with, spoke Japanese, so I asked in English what was fresh and recommended. He pointed at a whiteboard and said, \"These are our specials.\"\n\nI ordered a few things from the chef, then had a waitress come over and ask for my order. I explained I'd already ordered from the chef, but asked for a hot green tea.  My hot tea arrived, and was drunk, before my order arrived. \n\nInstead of serving my order to me over the glass, the chef told someone else counter order seven was ready, and then they gave my order to a waitress, who then brought it to me. \n\nThe fish was good, although for the price and portion size, I would expect to be at least good, especially in San Francisco.  The actual nigiri had a tendency to fall apart when dipped fish first in soy sauce.  For my six nigiri, I was given three slices of ginger. \n\nAt no point was my tea refilled, and it was clear that it was going to be well over $100 pre-tip if I wanted to fill up on nigiri sushi.  I paid my bill and walked around until I decided to get a salad at sweetgreens that was the bulk of my dinner. \n\nI know I'm pickier than the average American when it comes to sushi, but I've had better sushi in Vegas, Atlanta and New York, all for less than what was charged here. \n\nBetween the service, atmosphere and prices, I cannot endorse this place. \n\nI'm sure there's places to get great sushi at a fair price in San Francisco, but this is not it.", "author": "Eric P."}

As I took in the dark surroundings, the grand piano, and  the old time-y photos on the walls, I thought to myself, this should be interesting.\n\n$39.95 Sashimi Dinner - 14 pcs. sashimi w/ steamed rice & miso soup:\nThe plate include 3 pcs. tuna, 3 pcs. salmon, 3 pcs. yellowtail, 3 pcs. mackerel, 2 pcs. scallops, and octopus. The amount seemed a bit sparse on the plate, because they were neatly arranged in such a tight formation, but there they were, all 14 pieces, complete with lemon slices, wasabi, ginger, and a little garnish. The fish tasted sweet and tender. The tuna and hamachi had meatier texture and the salmon was pretty silky. The scallops were seasoned with a bit of soy sauce. \nI also ordered 2 pcs. tamago and uni nigiri. The tamago was sweet, and tightly wrapped with seaweed down the center. It wasn't the best tamago I ever had. The egg could have been rolled neater and tighter. But I don't want to be nitpicky.\nThe imported uni was pretty pricey, but there were about 3-4 slivers of buttery uni in each roll. \n\nSince this place gets a reasonable amount of buzz for its rolls, we ordered a couple to fill up on. I'm not a huge fan of sushi rolls, because I find that a lot of times they all end up tasting the same, with lots of the same 'ol ingredients - avocado, tempura, sriracha, etc.\n$7 Spicy Scallop - marinated scallop in spicy sauce, shiso, cucumber: \nPretty good, not great. The rice was a little hard, but the marinated scallops were fine.\n$13.50 49er's - crab & avocado w/ tuna & salmon on top:\nThis is kind of a dressed California roll with the tuna & salmon on top and nicely garnished with lemon slices. I quite liked it.\n\nI wouldn't want to wait in line during peak times. It must be rather uncomfortable and awkward on the stairs. However, I can definitely see how the techno music/DJ aspect of it would be appealing to nightclub-goers. I mean, after a few hours of living it up, you can really work up an appetite and possibly need to eat some rice to absorb all the alcoholic drinks. For late night meals, Ryoko's is obviously way more appealing than gorging on snacks from a convenience store. The fish was pretty good, but the prices are a little steep.", "author": "Joy W."}

The food itself was just okay (3 stars) but we had a terrible experience with the bill at the end of our meal.\n\nFortunately the prices are really reasonable so you can try a few different things. I really enjoyed the hiyashi wakame ($5) which is a seaweed salad dish. The shrimp and vegetable tempura ($9) and agedashi tofu ($5) appetizers were tasty but nothing special. The deep fried oysters ($7) were enormous so if you really like those I thought that was a good deal. For sushi we got the jumping unagi ($9) which was basically deep fried unagi rolls and the hot tuna roll ($7). I thought both of them were fairly mediocre quality but reasonable for the price.\n\nRegarding the negative experience at the end, the server sat our party of 2 at a large table shared with other parties of 2 we didn't know. That in itself was great and helped cut the wait time for us. The issue was each separate party had ordered their own meals and drinks but when it came to the bill the server had put the entire table on one tab and wouldn't split it for each separate party. So our table had to figure out who ordered what and it got so complex in the end we just split the bill evenly across all parties which was really frustrating for everyone (and my fiance and I ended up overpaying our actual amount). After that entire ordeal it then took over 20 minutes for them to give our cards back. I rarely have had such a frustrating dining experience.", "author": "Linda X."}

I don't have sushi very often, but my mom did successfully raise me to want kind of no frills raw fish in my sushi (though I DO love a Philadelphia roll, much to her chagrin), and that it's not \"real\" sushi unless it has raw fish in it (the snobbery, I know, I know).\n\nSo when I instead got a hamachi roll and a cucumber maki...I was disappointed. Cucumber isn't REAL sushi XD\n\nOkay, no biggie, mistakes happen. When the waitress came around, I politely said that I had ordered a tekka maki and not a cucumber maki, and she just looked at me and said, \"No, you ordered that.\" \n\n...um...no, no I did not...\n\nShe said she had repeated our order (there were about 6 - 7 dishes ordered among all of us). And totally fair, she had repeated our order, but this is also not a quiet restaurant. I understand how \"tekka\" could sound like \"kappa\" (which is apparently the cucumber one) on either side of our conversation, because I certainly didn't hear her say \"kappa\". Maybe it's because I know I had said \"tekka\" and that's what I was listening for.  \n\nHad she said something like, \"Oh, I'm sorry, I must have heard you wrong, I'll get you the tekka maki\" then that would've been lovely and we would've been great.\n\nBut instead, she just said, \"No, that's not what you ordered\" and left.\n\nOh.

We decided to try most of the items and got a cold sake. I was a little disappointed in the selections, but I couldn't be too picky. There were also some items that were not available and it was kind of weird because we thought that those items would come from the sushi bar. I would have to say that about half of the sashimi and rolls were decent. The rest of them did not taste very fresh. I am assuming they cater mostly to the drinking crowd, but drunk people still have some semblance of taste and it did not taste very good.

Overall, service is fast, food comes out fast, lots of cocktails to choose from, great food, good quality fish. \n\nSo let me break down each component:\nService\nThe waitstaff is super nice. It seems like they have been working there for quite some time so they know their stuff. They are quick and accommodating. Anytime we ask for additional items for the table, they will never forget. I can ask any waitstaff and they will let our waiter know that we need something and he will bring it to the table. They even offered to take us a photo. \n\nFood\nPrice is $$. Lots of variety from appetizers, sushi, rice dishes, etc. I mainly judge a sushi place by the fish and I can say that they picked great quality fish. I don't know if it is because I came at 6 before the dinner crowd, but you can tell the fish is fresh. The salmon and hamachi were buttery. They cut the tuna thin which I like because tuna tends to have a tougher texture than salmon. We ordered Tako with cucumber, agedashi tofu, and edamame as appetizers. Sushi - sashimi platter ($39), rainbow roll ($20), spicy scallop ($7), pokemon ($11.50) roll, hotate nigiri ($9 for 2), live ama ebi ($15.99 for two). The sashimi platter is worth the money, if covers the basic fish you would normally get. They are thin cuts so its not the 1 inch piece you can get at other places. In addition, they add in shrimp, octopus, and scallops in addition to the fish. \n\nFood is good!\n\nCleanliness\nI can't say its your nicest place, but it they keep the place clean. Tables are separated very well so that you can move. \n\nI would definitely come here again.

The hostess/waitress would call names; however, as more and more time progressed the hostess/waitress started to skip people who were waiting easily 45 minutes-1 hr before. So we complained that they skipped multiple couples that had been waiting the longest out of everyone along with other groups including us. After bringing this issue up, they began seating according to the actual list of names. The food was delicious until the check comes it's $101... needless to say we didn't order anything close to $101...we did the math items were doubled charged and over charged...the bill was mess. \n\nMoral of the story we really couldn't do anything so we rounded up a gave them 46 cent tip....before you all get offended on my pettiness.

A nice, light white fish.\n-Hamachi Toro - Who doesn't love Hamachi? And who doesn't love toro? You got that nice, fatty flavor combined with hamachi's delicious flavor. Really good even if I would have preferred a thicker slice.\n-Sake (Salmon) - The most basic, but I love salmon and the cheapest at $6.\n-Sake (Hot) - I was taking bart, why not keep drinking something warm on a cold July night.\n\nThey had some other special fish, including blue fin, but considering this was already up to $60, I decided better stop while I was good. \n\nMy server, who may have been the only server, was amazing.

They only open at 6, and when we got there at 5:50 there was already a line out the door. Since there is a flood of new diners all at the same time at 6, service is super slow. The waitress took a long time to take our order, and the rolls came out especially slow. An awkward thing is that the rolls would come out as they are made, with no sign of a working ordered system. One person had their rolls come out 15 minutes after everyone else has been served. This may not be a problem if you go later in the evening. The ambiance is super dark, which I did not mind, and they had upbeat and current music playing. But since this place is underground, it felt a little stuffy.

I came recently and did not think the same thoughts as before... if you're looking for a pretty legit sushi experience, there are other places in the city. The restaurant is kind of like a hole in the wall, since you have to go down into the basement level and then the tables are really close together. We ordered a pretty wide selection of rolls and sushi and the quality was a pretty wide-ranging mix.

But you do need that attitude that goes, \"I'm so cool, I don't mind waiting 50 mins as long as I'm drinking my beer(s) coz this is THE best sushi joint in the area!\" (not true)\n\nSave yourself the headache of finding street parking and pony up for a garage space and PATIENTLY wait for delicious apps, fresh nigiri and jive ass rolls. I'm more of a sushi purist and simply prefer my fish over rice or by itself. But we had an out of towner with us so we ended up here. Locals, you will be one of the few SFers here since this place is tourist central and if you like the sound of foreign languages while you dine, this is the place for you.\n\nThe prices are (surprise!) higher than normal. Who charges $39.95 for 14 slices of sashimi with rice? I'm no sushi genius but unless you're giving me the whole fish, that is way overpriced. I did like the foods that we ordered (hamachi sashimi, spicy tuna rolls, edamame, wakame salad, etc) but you should order the ochazuke which comes with a generous chunk of salmon and rice in a dashi broth and it's only $6.50!

I remember thinking \"this place seems really SF\". And boy, was I right. Ryokos best described is an underground club-like sushi bar with fresh fish and great music and vibes.\n\nDon't let the grungy super packed nature of this place fool you - the food is impeccable. They have a lot of fish flown in from Japan and their menu has lots of unique and delicious items. A lot of it is traditional - you won't really find much of the California-Fusion Japanese food here. A bit on the pricey side from other options in the area, but well worth the extra dough. \n\nYou must try the fresh fishes of the day - a lot of them you probably want to Google since they are usually pretty obscure. I've tried glassfish here which is by far the weirdest thing I've had at a Japanese restaurant in SF. Aside from the nigiri and sashimi specials, I'd recommend getting rolls from their menu as well as appetizers. I love their takoyaki and their sunomono salad. I think a lot of their rolls are simple, but it really lets their usage of ingredients and fresh fish shine through. \n\nService is rushed, but friendly, especially if you sit at the bar. Great vibes here - usually can strike some good conversations with fellow sushi-goers. Lots of locals come here frequently and the chefs are all super friendly. Great place for quick eats or for a authentic meal. There is usually a line however, but since the place is decently large and they flip tables fast the wait isn't that bad.

After driving for about 5 1/2 hours and checking in to the hotel, I was starving for some food. Starving is an understatement. I was famished. I saw that this place had decent stars and 45 minute out the door so I was confident that this was a good place to dine in for dinner. \n\nWe ordered tempura, dragon roll, and sexy roll. Never tasted anything so unswalloable. Dragon roll's unagi wasn't prepared well, with bones still intact \nAnd the unagi had extreme taste of fishiness. I have eaten enough of unagi in LA to know that this is not how unagi usually tastes like. We had to remove the unagi from the roll and eat the roll without it. It wasn't prepared well....\n\nThen we waited another 20 minutes for the sexy roll. When it finally came out, OMFG. It was in a tin foil. The salmon was clearly over cooked and tasted like canned tuna.  I mean it was so dry and sauce was so uneven. The roll was so dried on the top and soaked in sauce at the bottom. This was even nastier than the dragon roll. \n\nDo not bother ordering drinks. We ordered one Sapporo and sprite. Both were flat. I might of have just ordered sugared water. Service is very mediocre. Nothing spectacular. \n\nI honestly DO NOT UNDERSTAND how this type of sushi restaurant had 45 min wait. Is this what SF thinks is good sushi? I was honestly so confused. Did I mention that this sushi place is much more expensive than LA? Maybe I have higher standards from sushi in LA but I just don't understand. Not my cup of tea.", "author": "Julia HR L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-17", "description": "Thanks to Ryoko's for a really fun and honestly unforgettable birthday dinner earlier this month. I came here with a friend pretty late on a Saturday night, like 11:45pm late, after showing up to another SF sushi spot that had already closed its kitchen, but that turned out to be a blessing after all. There's a \"bouncer\" at the door (he was very nice) and it's a bit downstairs so it feels a little extra cool for a dinner spot. We had a bit of a wait, but only maybe 20 minutes.\n\nWe were seated right next to the dj (yeah there's a dj) which actually wasn't too loud like I was a little worried it may be. The dj \"booth\" is actually a closed grand piano.... which I can't decide if I love or loathe. I had a potted plant with me I'd bought earlier in the day - we were Ubering everywhere and hadn't been home - and we joked that the table was for 3; when we arrived at our table, there was a little stool for my plant (+1). Now, that actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it, since it frees up table space for more food and drink.\n\nWe ordered quite a bit to start and a bottle of sake for the two of us -- we also jokingly asked for a third shot glass, which they obliged (+2).\n\nMiso soup: it was your standard miso soup, but I liked that it was more miso-y than just salty.\n\nSteamed edamame: it was firm, not overdone at all, but it was served cool (or had been left out after steaming too long before making it to our table) and I'm not too about that.\n\nBeef oroshi - seared premium black angus beef slices with grated radish and ponzu sauce: I love rare steak, as rare as I can get it, and I love me some carpaccio. This dish did not disappoint. The meat was caramelized on the outside and that combination of rich and a little-bit-chewy that a perfectly rare steak has. The ponzu dipping sauce was just the sweet and salty mix to balance the meat out.\n\nDeep fried soft shell crab: I'm not the biggest fan of deep fried stuff, and soft shell crab can sometimes come out more fried-coating than crab, but the ratio was good here. The meat was flavorful (for crab) and it was surprisingly light.\n\nSake nigiri: this is always a go-to at sushi spots and how I assess if a place is worth getting fancier, like market price, nigiri later in the meal. Like traditional nigiri, wasabi was placed between the fish and the rice, so if you're like me and don't enjoy wasabi much, be warned.\n\nUnagi nigiri: this was not your typical sushi bar unagi nigiri, this was the softest, most melt-in-your-mouth fish I think I've ever had, no chewing required (well, besides the seaweed and rice). We got a second order of it before even finishing the first. This is an absolute MUST.\n\nI asked for toro (tuna belly) but they were out of it. My friend asked for sake toro, not on the menu, maybe on the specials(?), but they had it! We got two orders of nigiri, twice over the course of our meal. It was absolutely melt in your mouth. Salmon belly is my favorite nigiri and it made my belly very happy.\n\nMy friend also ordered hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), I think it might have been on the specials board? It was the best kama I've ever had, with much thicker (read: more) flesh that was super juicy and umami while still coming off the bone like butter. The meat itself isn't mindblowing (in general, this one was pretty tasty) but dipped in the ponzu sauce, it's an orgasmic experience. Just about every bite, I closed my eyes and smiled while I savored it.\n\nThe waitress recommended some bonito dish to us and we said, why not? I've never had bonito in any form besides flaked, so this was a treat. It's super meaty, like a tuna or mackerel; my friend ate most of it since it was dressed with too spicy a sauce for me. But what I did eat, I enjoyed!\n\nWhen I was in the restroom at the start of the meal, my friend had mentioned to our waitress that it was my birthday, and she came and sang me happy birthday with some little mochi ice cream balls. They even put three toothpicks in (one for my plant!! +3).\n\nMy friend settled the bill but I know it was a lot -- this place isn't the cheapest option around by a long shot, but it's worth it for the quality of the fish, the fun environment and attentive, knowledgeable staff, and variety of offerings of specialty dishes and types of nigiri. It's a special occasion place for sure, but very special in my opinion.\n\nThere are some weird af rolls on their menu I'd be down to try with like, 6 other people so everyone can just have one bite if nobody likes it (peanut butter and flying fish roe on the Volcano roll??? American cheese on the Sexy roll?? wtf).", "author": "Keridwyn R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-01", "description": "1/31/15:  First thing first: this place IS NOT TWO $.  It is easily $$$$!!!  I want to make that clear because we were really in for a surprise when we got here.  The reviews are great, and 2 $'s--awesome!  So we walked 2mi to get here through some REALLY rough parts of town, got seated, cracked open the menu... and WOW, this place is really expensive.  Trust me--if you're a guy, there's no way you will leave full without eating at least $60 worth of stuff.  Have no clue how this place could have gotten $$ next to their title.  We spent ~$200 for 3 and I can still eat about 2x what I got.\n\nMoving on, it looks very friendly inside and cozy.  Small space with lots of happy people crammed in.  Doesn't look all that fancy, but is certainly done up Japanese style.  Big huge bar.  Lots of happy people.  Very casual.  Even a bunch of people sitting on the stairs waiting for a table.  Not something you would associate with $$$$ prices.\n\nBut alas, the place is definitely in the upper-tier of cost... say even competitively priced to a place like Nobu.  So, is the cost deserved?....\n\n1. Namacho Honjozo Sake 300ml $25:  As the menu said, a little on the sweeter side, but not a \"sweet\" sake.  Was smooth.  Okay.  6/10\n\n2. Fried Cheese $5:  Probably, other than the prices, the only real disappointing moment.  Just some cheese rolled into won ton skins and fried.  Like zero effort here.  Served with an unimpressive sauce.  Skip this, trust me.  2/10\n\n3. House Salad $5.95:  Nothing fancy here.  Just a standard selection of greens.  Nothing Japanese about this one except maybe the dressing.  4/10\n\n4. Hama Kama $17.50:  This would be the collar (rear section of head) of a hamachi fish.  And gawd, it is REALLY good.  I've had salmon collars, tuna collars, etc., at many places, and I think this one is the best I've ever had.  The meat is so juicy, so buttery.  Amazingly tender.  Totally melts in your mouth.  My only complaint is that the skin is not as crispy as it can be, but they serve it upside down, so I guess... whatever.  9/10\n\nAlright.... so, now we are getting to the sushi.  Here's the deal: their pieces are small.  Much smaller than the typical sushi place in California.  Now, when I was in Japan I would say that they tend to make their sushi in a similar size and style, so it's probably the case that other places here make theirs bigger to seem a better deal.  But anyway, here, it is damn small.  If you're hungry you'll want to order 2x as much as you normally would.\n\n5. Nigiri Sushi Dinner $39.95:  So here's the first example of their pricing.  It's nearly $40 for 9!!! pieces of nigiri, and some California roll.  Insane.  I need at least 2-3x of these to be full.  Again, these pieces are SMALL.\n\nBUT............ OMFG it's GOOD SUSHI.  I think this is the most tasty sushi I've had since moving up to the Bay Area 2 years ago!  So fresh!  Everything was so flavorful and so clean.  Nothing overly fancy looking here, just really really really high-quality sushi.  So, again, ignoring my expectations from a $$ Yelp restaurant, and the uber casual environment, .... as a $$$$ place, keeping in mind even the simpleton California rolls was extraordinarily good.... 10/10\n\n6. Masaba (Mackerel) Nigiri 3pc $8.95:  Man, that's some good mackerel.  So tasty.  Yet, does not have that gritty fibrous taste of the not-so-good ones.  Has a bit of that slight crunch, and just totally melts in your mouth afterwards.  One of the best.  10/10\n\n7. Uni (Sea Urchin) Sashimi $15.80:  So, the sashimi uni vs the nigiri version only really differs in that the sashimi is served on a shiso leaf, and the nigiri is of course on rice.  Otherwise each \"1pc\" is made up of 2 chunky and short smaller pieces.  Typically the uni I've had is longer, but these are short and cute.  Zero fishiness.  Zero bitterness.  So.... clearly extremely fresh and high-quality.  However, I do miss some bite.  A little too perfect for me.  9/10\n\n8. Uni (Sea Urchin) Nigiri 2p $15.80:  See #7.\n\n9. Unagi (BBQ Eel) Nigiri 3p $11.25:  Beautiful pieces.  Great tasting.  But I think not particularly special, but clearly well cooked.  8/10\n\n10. Hamachi Toro Nigiri 3pc $13.50:  The cheaper toro, apparently.  But still damn good.  Again, that crispness of ultra fresh fish is combined with that buttery sensation.  Divine.  And compared to the tuna toro, not too bad of a price.  10/10\n\nSo, the key here is to ignore your subconscious instincts to expect cheaper eats after seeing the $$ next to the title, and seeing the extremely casual surroundings.  Except to spend a fortune and then you will enjoy yourself a lot more.  This is some of the very best sushi I have ever found up here that does not have a Michelin star, and I'm sure you'd love it (as long as your friend picks up the bill.)\n\n5/5\n\n#japanese #sushi #sashimi", "author": "Dean C."}

We were both starving and I was willing to splurge for our first sushi in a while.. \n\nWe began with the seaweed starter ($5) which came out immediately with our waters. It was pretty tasty but unfortunately there was basically half a handful's worth, a theme that would continue throughout the meal. Our meal was several sushi rolls: the Alaskan A's (~$7), the Tahoe (~$7), the Golden Gate (~$10), the 49ers (~$13), and the spicy scallops...except we never got the spicy scallops as the waiter somehow didn't record it. \n\nFirst of all, our rolls arrived after a lengthy, probably 30 minute wait (meanwhile, the table next to us, which ordered after us, got their sushi before us, as well as their next order of sushi). And when it came, boy was it a disappointment. Normally I think of rolls as being at least 6-8 pieces...here the rolls are maximum 6 pieces and the cheaper rolls only had 5 pieces. The pieces were incredibly thin too, and cut in uneven shapes and sizes. Our chan-chan (college campus) sushi was better, gosh darn it! Basically, imagine a normal sized sushi roll, and cut it in half haphazardly, and that's what you get here. The sushi itself was solid if unspectacular. But the price for the quantity and wait is outrageously bad. Adding along careless order management (the table next to us also had a missing edamame order somehow so it seems to be an anecdotal trend) equates to a poor sushi experience.  \n\nI was really disappointed, given the good reviews. We were still hungry after eating the impoverished rolls, and God knows how long we'd have to wait for the next order, so we ended up getting sandwiches down the street at Bite (which were phenomenal sandwiches btw). \n\nBottom line: This place is a bar...that just happens to serve sushi.

The only place open around with good Yelp rating was Ryoko's. So we made our way from the Sheraton on Fisherman's Wharf to this place. Driving in San Francisco and seeing the hilly roads of San Francisco for the first time made this little trip very exciting. Once there, we took a few seconds to find this place as it is behind a little door on a practically empty street at night and this place is underground too. Once we entered, we knew that this was the coolest Sushi bar we have ever seen. There was music playing in the background and the place had a very casual setting. It almost didn't feel like a Japanese sushi parlor at all. We chose to sit at the sushi bar and got spots immediately however there was a huge line that kept building for tables even at 11pm in the night. The menu showed that they had a lot of eel rolls and we love eel. But they ran out of eel on that particular night so no eel for us! We placed our orders with some rolls. The food came in pretty quickly and it all tasted very good. I wouldn't say it was the best but not bad at all. And since this place is open till 2am, it makes a great hanging spot as a late night joint with friends over good food instead of oily bar food.", "author": "Oly M."}

The food was nothing outstanding. There's not a large selection of rolls to choose from and they were out of a few things that night, which sucked. We tried to \"customize\" a few things and they said they couldn't do it...I was so confused. There's only been a few other places that I've been to where they couldn't \"customize\" a roll. The quality of fish was really good, though. I just wish that overall, they had a better menu. *I continue to quote the word customize because my request for customization was placing salmon on top of one of their rolls on the menu* \n\nATMOSPHERE: 2 stars.\nSo packed in here OMG. From the minute you walk in the door, there are people lining the stairs waiting for a table. It is extremely dark and super tight. I could practically hold hands with the table next to us.

I think it's a cool spot with fair prices, but the sushi really leaves a lot to be desired. Nothing was bad. It's just that nothing was really that good either. I get the same exact (if not better) quality sushi at Safeway, minus the rice being fresher at Ryoko's. I can't hate on much. I just can't love on anything here either. The space is cool. That's it. Good quality tuna. Terrible cocktails and desserts, complete with cheesy whipped cream and a maraschino cherry on top. Ryoko's is someone's cash cow. There's very little love put into the quality of the ingredients or the menu. Grab some Safeway sushi, turn off all the lights in your house, and put on some Spotify.

Most places were closed obviously, I came across Ryoko and saw it had good ratings so I had to try it out. When we first came the security guard outside was kind, same for the rest of staff. They were all helpful and really kind to us. I ordered miso soup, California roll, jumping california, and shrimp symphony. I did enjoy the three rolls but the jumping California felt a little greasy and I just got tired of it after awhile. Mind you each roll had six pieces. The more I ate the jumping California roll, the more my head started to hurt because I just did not enjoy the fried sushi style. I also notice about 80% of their sushi had mayo, so from a mayo hater I kind of just had to suck it up and eat the ones with mayo but I couldn't really taste it anyways so it was all good. My boyfriend ordered the Pok\u00e9mon roll and Philadelphia roll. He told me that the Pok\u00e9mon roll tasted pretty much like a sandwich and thought the Philadelphia was okay. Overall, the food was okay. It wasn't super amazing. I've just been to so many sushi places that were much better. I really did dig their miso soups though.

There's a bouncer outside for some reason like a club; wasn't sure why until I walked in and it sounded like Ibiza. I think there's a DJ inside, so it's definitely ear split-tingly loud in there. It's also seemingly in a basement with very few or no windows, so there's nowhere to escape it. Food was not very flavorful, and the chirashi was really disappointing: unevenly cut fish, small amount of rice for the quantity of fish you receive, and unwillingness to modify the order (we asked for no tomago or ebi; I get it if it's mixed in and you can't leave it out, but the eggs and shrimp were literally placed on top, inside the bowl...you can't just not place that on top at the end before you serve it? C'mon man. The rolls were uninspired and not very satisfying. The beef oroshi was the lone highlight; pretty sad when medium rare beef over some generic green salad is the best part of a sushi restaurant meal. You have to remind the staff frequently if you need refills or any other food items; I get it's busy, and I'm patient, but 20 minutes for some wasabi? The place isn't that big.

My friends and I were there at 6pm on a Sunday (right when it opened), so we were able to get seated quickly. Within half an hour, there was a line out the door. It's a fun atmosphere - with old school hip hop and rap playing in the background and the staff shouting greetings when a customer arrives. The drinks have fun names (e.g. I got a \"Tap dat ass\").  I got a chirashi bowl ($30) and my friends got  6 various rolls (that probably clocked in at around $20 per roll). The sushi here is not cheap, but it's decent quality. My chirashi bowl was not the most beautiful chirashi bowl I've ever gotten and could have used more rice, but overall, the fish was fresh and it was tasty. The bowl had slices of asparagus and the tomago was chopped up into tiny cubes, which is unusual, but I didn't mind. Overall a fun experience with decent sushi.

There were Japanese restaurants operated by Korean, Mongolians and Chinese. Although these restaurants offered good food, the sushi making craft is and should always be an art. There were seafood messily places on top of loosely packed rice in different sizes. We really needed a change. Therefore we stopped by Ryoko on the last day. Although it is located in a basement of one of San Francisco's many buildings this restaurant was a jewel. The food was crafted perfectly. They had original treats such as, Hamachi Kama (Blue fin collar) and Chicken Karaage (Deep fried battered chicken). Ryoko also offered a large selection of hot  and cold Sake and Shochu. The music was very loud, but that just added to the atmosphere. The only down side was being offered jigger glasses for the cold sake. This was quickly remedied with a request for slightly larger glasses. \nWe were truly sorry for finding this so late in our vacation, but also glad we found it.\nWhen in San Francisco I hope you have the opportunity to satisfy you Japanese palate at Ryoko. It will be worth it. \nThis is a hidden gem. \nGood job to the Ryoko staff.", "author": "Curtis K."}

The sushi rolls were just average tasting and on the pricey side. They were not even nice enough to take photos of honestly... I tried the Pokemon roll and dragon roll. Service is alright. Seems like they were understaffed that night since they were not as attentive as I would have liked.

All I can say is...WHY??? Buttttt let's look at the positives...living close to the place means it's easy to get in with no wait right? Start staking a claim on the line 20 minutes before opening, you are solid!\n\nRyoko's is definitely more of a true sushi bar than other sushi spots that specialize in rolls. But if all you order is a bunch of nigiri, it's going to start costing a pretty penny. So with that said, the chicken karaage to start (very crispy!) and the Dragon and Checkerboard rolls. Although you only get six pieces with each roll, the fish is pretty fresh. \n\nWith that said, the highlight though had to be the uni and toro we ordered. SO amazingly tasty with that melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only regret is that there was only one piece each for us. :( \n\nIt's definitely a little more expensive than the typical sushi restaurant, but you do get the quality that comes with it.

Granted it is a place with a full bar that serves food late. The prices and the portion size are ridiculous. Spent over $180 for 4 people on food, 3 beers, 2 hot sake, and 1 cocktail.  I would understand the cost of it if it was worth it, but not really. Beef teriyaki was good but to ask for spicy option it is just sriracha placed on it. I am just glad the uni was good, sake sashimi was ok. Tako was over cooked. It is still cramped, but they do have a live dj to distract you from the stuffiness of the place. Sexy roll looked nothing sexy. It was burned that it was hard to get the roll off the foil. Roll would just fall apart from the tug of war. The other roll was just a crunchy exterior with crab and avocado, served with sweet chili sauce. Personally I would have just stuck to the sashimi and not even bothered for the rolls. \n\nParking is street, so good luck.

You slowly progress down and step by step you start to get a view of what the restaurant and atmosphere is like; You have arrived at Ryoko's.  And boy was the wait worth it.\n  I'm not much of a critic, but I can be a bit of a rice snob after living in Japan for two years.  It's difficult to find a place that can touch any taste authentic taste of Japan, but Ryoko's has a unique blend of the old and a touch of a CA in a great blend of atmosphere and good food.  I could probably go in there alone and still have a well enjoyed meal.  It doesn't hurt to ask for a bottle of sake.\n  It doesn't have your typical Sushi bar feel.  It really feels like you're walking into a bar you're going to meet your pals at on a Friday after work, except way better.  Inconspicuous as it may be, there's nothing hidden about it.  This joint was packed.  We must have waited about an hour, but the smells, atmosphere, and curiosity made the anticipation force me to stick around.  I was not disappointed.\n  The service was good and the food was presented quickly.  You don't wait because the service is slow; You wait because people keep ordering.  The lights are dim and the look of the place made me feel like I was visiting some obscure, invitation only, chefs' layer in the docks somewhere with no cares other than the food.  I know it may seem at odds, but I enjoyed the sushi this way.  It actually made me want to keep pouring the sake and eat till I passed out.  \n  Check this place out if you live in SF or just visiting.  It's a little surprise in an area filled with culinary delights.  To be able to stand out and put out great service as good as the food is delightful.  I would go there with friend, family, a date, or alone.  I'll be coming back to this joint next time I'm in SF to watch my Dodgers stomp on the Giants.  Sorry, had to throw that in there.

I'm a seasoned sushi-goer and there was a line around the corner of patrons simply waiting to be let in at 5:40pm. I figured this was a positive sign. The place is very large inside and there is plenty of seating for at least 50 people at a time throughout the restaurant. By the time I left around 8pm the line was crazy long.\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high after reading all the Yelp reviews... or maybe I'm learning that Yelp is not always made up of people with developed palates.. or maybe I went here on an off night. Whatever the case, coming here once was more than enough for me. \n\nI was sat at the bar, which I anticipated because I was solo. I washed my hands with the disposable disinfectant cloth and no one picked it up even 15 minutes later. Soon my chop stick wrapper was next to it and still no one picked the little pile up. This was the start of a night of me busing my own eating area. I ordered an Asahi because it's hard to mess up beer. It took about 15 minutes for my beer to show up and service was slow the whole night. \n\nPop music was pumping loudly through the restaurant, which is an interesting choice for a sushi joint. To quote another Yelper, it's essentially a loud bar that also serves okay sushi.\n\nOn to food...\nOysters on the half shell were $3/each. I'm fine with that price EXCEPT for the fact that they were very small oysters and they were so fishy tasting that I couldn't finish them. I love oysters and I eat them in LA and NY, the places you know the catch will be good. I was so very, very disappointed in these. \n\nThen I was disappointed to learn they did not have albacore tonight. Really? I thought it's a staple at sushi establishments and it's my favorite fish. I ordered salmon and yellowtail sushi anyway.... and although the fish pieces themselves were good serving sizes and excellent, the rice under the fish was almost nonexistent! I've never see anything like it before. So bizarre. The fish was great quality and the price was very reasonable for that. About $9/two pieces. \n\nI moved on to the beef oroshi, which was decent. The meat was cooked as it should be (medium rare) but the ponzo sauce tasted really odd to me, so I stuck with soy sauce. Was nothing I'd order again. \n\nI finished with the Jumping California roll which was by far the best thing I ate, but it's also deep fried and comes with a spicy sauce, which tells you that it's not actually something I should be raving about at a sushi place.

Walking in you're hit with a smell of old fried food, and the music is so loud. The coke I ordered was flat. We ordered the fried cheese as a starter which was pretty good. We also ordered a tiger roll, a California roll, and a Philadelphia roll. These were mediocre at best - kind of blah, like they were missing something. Overall this was a cheap, quick sit down meal, but I don't understand the ratings and the raving reviews. I'm from Michigan and our local sushi place has rolls that are 10x better than this one. Not to mention they bussed the table before we even got the bill, which was weird. Rather disappointing dinner - definitely won't be back.", "author": "Ashley G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-03", "description": "Ryoko is a top 5 sushi places in San Francisco for me. (I'm excluding the omakase places from this since that's a different experience altogether.)\n\nThe San Francisco sushi scene isn't fringe. We know how to do sushi here. That means that even mid-level quality for SF is pretty good compared to the rest of the country. (I'll double-down: There's no better city for sushi outside of Japan!) Thus, Ryoko only gets 4 stars because it's battling in the toughest sushi cage match in the nation.\n\nThe sushi is excellent. Their uni and tamago - the standards of good, fresh sushi in my book - are always great and their tako nigiri isn't rubbery. They have seasonal and special fish each night, and at least one of them each time will be worth the experience. They have a great assortment of rolls too.\n\nExpect to wait to get in. There's almost always a line. Just put your name on the clipboard up front and wait on the stairs. The max I've ever waited was 20 minutes and that was when it was slammed.\n\nHere's the magic thing about Ryoko though. Good sushi: yes. Great sake: yes But let's be honest ... Ryoko shines because it stays open late and has a great atmosphere. Don't come here for a quiet, romantic dinner. This place pushes fun, loud, close quarters and friendships. I've come here with a group of 6 friends and the comfort level we shared (over sake and great sushi) was so good you would have thought we were in someone's living room. Also, every time I come here on a date, my date and I end up making friends with folks at the next table (this is a great icebreaker for that first meeting, incidentally), one time even sharing sake and getting the married couple to agree to kiss if we did too. (I like to think we saved their marriage that night.)\n\nAgain, this is top 5 sushi in the city (minus the omakase places - I already said that!) so you're not losing the amazing flavor experience. But the atmosphere is the thing that brings it into the stratosphere.", "author": "Daniel H."}

I'm happy it got good reviews and high rated because the wait is forever and the live DJ plays house music. Took about an hour for our table and wait is about 20min extra because they bring all the rolls out at once l. Each roll comes to be 5-6 cuts. \n\nThe atmosphere is fun and very cultural. It is underground so for T-Mobile carriers, don't expect reception. The other people in our parties with at&t and Verizon did not have a problem.\n\nFor a party of four we started off with 5 rolls and the tofu appetizer. It was not enough, we did not anticipate 5 rolls each and the tofu only had three pieces, so we shared one. It's good and they prepare it like takoyaki.\n\nAfter the 5 rolls we ordered four more. I'll break it down to the ones that stood out. Total, we ordered the Pokemon roll, Philadelphia roll, volcano, salmon skin, golden gate roll, hot tail, hot tuna, Tahoe, and the sexy roll. 9 total for a party of four.\n\nMy favorite was the volcano roll because I love peanut butter and there's a hint in there followed by jalepeno so it can be spicy. That's a plus for me.\n\nThe Pokemon roll is the only awkward one since its wrapped in soy paper and has mangos in it. Very good chaser if your mouth is on fire. Its sweet and savory.\n\nThe sexy roll is baked with cheese and was made to perfection. The top had a layer of harden cheese but followed by gooeyness right under it. Reccomend as well. \n\nMy boyfriend usually grades a resturaunt by how well their salmon skin roll is and this alone was probably 3 stars. My bet would be that it was sitting around before served to us cause it was more chewy than having a light crisp. \n\nTips and headsup:\n--Women's restroom is upstairs while the guys is towards the back. \n--can get hot since underground\n--all the rolls are served at once so it can take a while depending on what you order.\n--have good company cause there's a lot of free time\n--waitress always wants to serve you more alcohol to kill time.\n\nOverall awesome it closes late, not so awesome for the long wait.

But funky surroundings aside, the sushi here is really good. And fresh fish is what it's all about, right? \n\nI've been here a few times and sampled everything from the rolls to the sashimi to the salads to the hot dishes, and everything has been very good. However I think one of the more impressive things here is the simple quality of the fish. Fresh as can be. The rolls are a'ight, and the various non-sushi dishes are quite good, but definitely on the expensive side (especially for the environs). My 14-piece sashimi last night was a steep $39 while the slightly smaller chirashi is $30. Don't get me wrong - I don't mind paying for good fish, but this seems a little steep. The sashimi cuts aren't generous. \n\nThat all said, I dig Ryoko's and will most definitely be back. I don't mess around with weak fish, and the fish here is very, very good.

The rolls were really where my problems were. There is this over abundance of imitation crab and mayonnaise. Maybe that's a thing, but it's not my thing.  My wife is allergic to eggs so this essentially evolved into an inconvenience when ordering around that. Additionally, we seemed to have ordered just as a fresh batch of rice was delivered to the bar because when we got our sushi it was noticeably warm. Again-a thing, maybe, but just not mine. This place has a dark, almost dive bar ambience with very loud music. I can appreciate that as a signature trait of Ryoko's.

After seeing the mixed reviews about the chirashi dons my friend and I were hesitant to get it considering the price but we decide to treat ourselves and splurged. I also got the hamachi roll since the chirashi dons looked small.\n\nOur chirashis were smaller than the ones pictured on Yelp. The layer of rice was very thin. The rice itself had good flavor and texture with the flavor leaning on the sweeter side. Unlike the chirashis pictured, our chirashi somewhat resembled bara sushi where they cut up the fish and put them on top. Our tamago, tako, cuttlefish, and saba were cut and scattered. I'm personally not a big fan of this style especially since the room is dark and separating the pieces was difficult. For $35 we got approximately 10 pieces + ikura (including the cubes) of a regular selection of fish such as hamachi, tuna, salmon, albacore, saba, etc. There was one more interesting fish that I wasn't able to identify that had a nice flavor but it was familiar enough for me to know it's not an especially costly piece of fish. I was hoping that with the high price we'd get some uni or at least some scallops. The quality of the fish was decent but not extremely flavorful or fatty. Besides the actual small cut cubed pieces, several slices of fish looked like they were hacked through with a dull knife. I'm not one to be nitpicky about presentation but for $35 I'd like to feel like I was eating something prepared by with a chef's knife and not a pocket knife. Honestly I'm not sure what luck we had to get this sad chirashi. The highlights of the chirashi was definitely the saba. I loved their pickling and I would rather have a bowl of just that. (2/5 overall) (3.5-4/5 for the fish quality)\n\nMy hamachi roll was a lot better. It was a decent light roll to have.  It's nothing particularly interesting but it was pretty tasty. (3.5/5)\n\nOverall, between the tight seating, average service, and steep prices, I left extremely disappointed by this place after hearing so many good things about it.

It's downstairs of a building. I personally don't like the atmosphere because it feels kind of dirty. There was one time I had to move tables, because it smelled really bad (like piss) at one corner of the restaurant.\n\nI ordered a lot off the specials menu during my last visit, which were all pretty good. I got the hamachi kama, takoyaki, and the ankimo. They probably have the best ankimo that I've ever tried. I also really like the beef teriyaki here, which they cook perfectly every time I come.\n\nI personally don't think the sushi is that great and worth the price here. The sushi rolls are mainly rice with little fish. The fish doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't very fresh either.\n\nService is alright. There are days when our server is really attentive and friendly. There are other days when the service is whatever. There was one time the sever misheard my order, and tried to make it seem like it was our fault. \n\nOverall, I think the hot items on the menu are good, but when I come back, I will definitely try more sushi items also. The main reason why I come back is because it's open late. I would've gave this place 4 stars if it didn't smell so bad that one time.", "author": "Derek T."}

Came here on a Saturday night with 4 friends. The atmosphere of the place kind of reminded me of izakayas in Tokyo - located in a basement level of a building, quite dim, and quite busy and loud.\n\nWe decided to share a few things, and we started off with the appetizers:\n- Octopus + Wakame: a few small pieces of raw octopus over a little bit of seaweed. Pretty good, raw octopus was fresh, chewy, and tasty. But tiny and not worth the price.\n- Chicken karaage: highlight of the meal. Comes with 6 large pieces of chicken, which was very tender and flavorful. It was so good we decided to add another order.\n- Saba (mackerel): cooked well, juicy and tender. Skin was crispy, which was great.\n\nThen we shared five rolls: 49ers, pokemon, jumping tuna, spicy scallop, and dragon rolls. All of theme were decent but not particularly memorable. The quality of the seafood was pretty average. Especially the salmon, which tasted a bit stringy and not quite fresh. Also the spicy scallop was a bit saltier than I would have liked.\n\nPrice was a bit on the high side for the quality and quantity of food. Recommend a try if you are in the area. Also try to avoid the peak hours. At about 6pm, we didn't have to wait in line, but as we left at 7pm the line was very long.", "author": "Alvin W."}

The waitress that served us already seemed like she was in a rush and was a little impatient.\n\nI was starving, so I ordered quite a lot for myself. I ordered the edamame as an appetizer and then ordered the Tahoe, Big Mama, and Hot Tuna.\n\nShe brought out the edamame about 10 seconds after I ordered it. It was weird though because they had JUST opened and we were one of the first to order, but their edamame was soggy. Like it had been there for a long time.\n\nThe Tahoe is a sushi roll with tuna, avocado, and flying fish roe. I would have to say I liked this one the best. They are generous with the amount of fish they put inside their rolls. My mouth was stuffed with tuna, so I was surprised.\n\nThe Big Mama is spicy bbq eel, egg, shiso (sesame leaf), cucumber, and flying fish roe. The shiso tasted strong in most of the pieces I ate. Nonetheless, it was good, but I could've done without it. In my last piece of Big Mama, though, I got chunks of eel bones and they stabbed my bottom gums. The piece of shiso in the end piece was huge, so I could barely taste the eel.\n\nLastly, the Hot Tuna is marinated tuna with spicy sauce, shiso, and cucumber. I'm a fan of spicy foods, but even this one had a kick in every bite. It was decent, but again, I could've done without the shiso (sesame leaf). It made the sushi roll taste a little weird (in my opinion).\n\nAfter one of the waitors had cleared our table and our waitress knew we weren't going to order anything else, we still waited about 10 minutes for her to bring the check to us.

I forgot what it was called but it had salmon on it.\n\nI would have given them 4 stars if what happened next didn't happen...\n\nWe got the check and they only accept a max of 3 credit cards so our party put in 3 cards to slit the bill. We get the receipts back, but only 2 credit cards are in there... but we get the receipts for the 3 cards which means they already charged us. We notify the staff right away and they begin looking for it. \n\nNow 20 minutes later and they're still searching. At one point, out waitress almost gives up because she comes to our table and says they searched everywhere. We were thinking \"what the heck, we literally just gave you the 3 cards and you lost it\" but we would patiently wait there all night if we had to.

If they have blue fin toro on the specials list you need to try it. In fact the specials menu should be your go to, then the regular menu. Everything here is fresh, all the fish and ingredients are super high quality, and the presentation is beautiful. I also recommend trying out some of the side dishes, appetizers, and grilled squid.

If you're looking to eat NOW, move on and find another place with good reviews. If you can wait, you wont be disappointed. \n\nI had the Sexy roll, which if you're not into completely raw fish, is a good choice because its baked! With cheese. Mmmm. A great roll in general and one that I put in my mental notebook to have someone try if they are new to sushi.\n\nMy other roll was the Jumping Unagi. It's a fried roll which I am normally a fan of but it could've used a little less breading. The flavor was there but i had to work around too much breading to get to it. Somewhat my fault- I ordered a fried roll, what else can I expect?\n\nMy friend ordered a Big Mama roll. Great flavor but it is spicy. Not excessively but if you're not a fan of spicy, just avoid it. \n\nMy seaweed salad was good but it is NOT the normal stringy seaweed I've had everywhere else. Perhaps this is more authentic (idk??) but its more like chopped up strips and nuttier/earthier in flavor. But paired with the pickled cucumbers it comes with, it was still quite good. Not what I expected but good.\n\nSake bombs were $5 a pop. I was happy :)\n\nI don't think i'd recommend this place for a first date bc it's loud with the rave music (i wasn't kidding), somewhat cramped seating and yelling between the servers (it was their system, but hey, it got me my food pretty quickly).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-10", "description": "On the one hand, I'm not sure why Ryoko's is so popular.  Based on what we had, there's nothing about the food that distinguishes itself from what any other legit sushi spot can offer.  Yet, at the same time, I'm sure the bulk of what we ate didn't represent the best Ryoko's has to offer.\n\nFor my friend's birthday, his wife was able to snag a reservation for the mostly private back room.  Our party wasn't exceptionally large (there were ten of us), but it was nice having a slightly quieter space to ourselves (the restaurant can get quite noisy).  Plus, with the way the place fills up on weekends, reservations are just generally a good idea (though I hear they may not take them anymore?)\n\nTo make things easier, my friends decided to order a bunch of rolls for the entire table to share.  Unfortunately though, several of them ordered a lot of Ryoko's cooked and fried varieties, like the Jumping Tuna, Jumping California, Jumping Unagi, and Kentucky (with multiples of some, as well).  Nothing I would order for myself, and nothing particularly inspired (fried chicken in a roll?  Really?).  It didn't help either that, amazingly, all of the \"Jumping\" rolls tasted the same (batter and oil).\n\nWhile all of the cooked rolls were highly underwhelming, I will say a couple of the fresh ones weren't bad.  Although it was a little too saucy, the Spicy Scallop Roll ($5.50) was pretty tasty, and I thought the Tahoe Roll was great all around (Tuna, Avocado, and Tobiko, $7.00).  However, the highlight for me was the Hamachi Nigiri ($6.00) I was able to snag for myself - big, quality cuts of deliciousness.\n\nSince Ryoko's does a significantly better job with its sashimi and nigiri, and since I really didn't get to check out much of it, this review might be a little low.  That said, the cooked rolls we had were not all that authentic or delicious, so perhaps the three stars is appropriate.  In any case, I'll give Ryoko's another shot one day.  It helps that they're open so late every night, even though parking in the area can be a beast.", "author": "Mike L."}

And keep in mind every time we're here its a party of 2. A tip is a tip its not forced. So adding a service charge to the bill is not acceptable and i will not pay it. Now .. you do not ask for how much to be tipped, i will tip based on the service I received; And the manager should talk to this waitress and tell her off. I come here way too often but with waitresses like that the restaurant could be losing money. Shame on you waitress coming after people for forced tips", "author": "Koko B."}

I'm one of those people who will give up comfort for taste...so you'll find me in a lot of hole-in-the-walls! Not to say that Ryoko is a hole-in-the-wall, but the space is definitely small and cramped! The sign on the wall says max capacity is 88, but it was obvious there was wayyyy more than 88 people inside (not to mention the line of ~15 people standing by the door). Whatever. I don't care because the sushi here is fresh and so dericious!\n\nMake sure to get here early so you'll get to eat during the first seating. Otherwise, be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins to an hour. The good thing is, if you do have to wait, they'll take your drink order so you can have a beer or cocktail while you wait.\n\nMy friend and I split the nigiri dinner (9 pieces of Chef's choice nigiri, a CA roll, and a miso soup), 1 order of salmon nigiri, 1 order of amaebi nigiri, 1 Alaskan roll, and 1 Salmon Delight roll. The fish is fresh, but the sushi rice here is mouth-watering good! The fried fish head from the amaebi was also to die for! I have never eaten the fish head that comes with amaebi, but they battered it in tempura and fried it so crispy that it was just irresistible! \n\nThe waitress/hostess was really friendly and attentive. She was all smiles despite how busy and crowded they were. Our server was also very fast and friendly. Our total including 2 ice teas came out to ~$75 plus tip. Strictly street parking as with most of the restaurants in the area, but luckily it was a quick walk from our hotel in Union Square.", "author": "Nancy N."}

Yet I can't help but go into this type of restaurant every time expecting a Cha Cha-level experience.\n\nUnfortunately, this place just can't compare. The rolls are priced similarly, but that's where the similarities end. The rolls are much smaller, and the WOW factor just isn't there. My dining partner enjoyed the Kentucky Roll, which has fried chicken -- but I mean, how wrong can you go with fried chicken. I enjoyed the creamy Sexy Roll. The Fried Cheese appetizer was also decadent. \n\nThe service was extremely friendly, and unlike most places in San Francisco, this place is open until 2 AM. If I'm hankering for untraditional sushi and in the city, I would probably go to Ryoko's again. But if I want a truly amazing dining experience, I'll make the trek down to Cha Cha in San Jose.", "author": "Mark C."}

Coming after the Warriors' parade which coincided with the mayors' conference which coincided with the President's and Hillary's visits which coincided with the centennial celebration for City Hall... well, you get the picture as traffic was a cluster.... that day!  My friend wisely dropped off his wife while he and I drove through the maze to my office to carpool there.  Running about twenty five minutes late, we struck gold in scoring front door parking... as in, I could roll a penny down those stairs!\nMy friend's wife ordered several items so our wait was relatively short for food.  \nHere's a summary of what we had:\n\nHighlights:\n1.  Ama ebi heads (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7w0OswvyXjQ-pPgrDykcHQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Deep fried crispy, not greasy.\n\n2.  Fried octopus (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fdje9MQOJe7m9Fol6RvUSg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Wasn't planning on ordering, but every table around us did.  Yummy and tender chewy good.\n\n3.  Fish sashimi - Everything was visually and texturally on point.\n\n4.  Bluefin tuna (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xiwKQxTJdhrtA1avcAEq9A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Great presentation and that egg really mixed well.\n\nNot so much:\n1.  Uni - Not that it was bad, but our conversation centered around where the best uni comes.  Didn't stand out.\n\n2.  Chicken karaage (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RDVCRgc1s84JLvztHTGoTA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit dry, just okay.\n\n3.  Agedashi tofu (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kgdLfxTU7aZU-RjTSBMLLQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Simple and flavors didn't really shine.\n\nThe beef tataki was solid but needed a bit more ponzu sauce.  Very solid meal as my hosts obviously knew what they were doing mixing whiteboard specials with familiar menu items for them.\nSeems that this literal hole in the ground is equally about the food and atmosphere.  It is a bit dark and kind of reminds me of basement bars in Chinatown that used to be packed.  We left as the DJ was warming his groove on and the stairs were lined with people snaking to Taylor Street.  Our waitress and servers were attentive and accommodating as we ate at a relaxed pace.  If you come on warm days (read 'hot'), it does get a bit warm in here as, being in a basement location without windows, there is not much ventilation; fortunately, our evenings aren't THAT warm here.  Thanks to my generous and knowledgeable hosts for inviting me to a unique experience and a view of where the \"hip\" part of the City hangs.", "author": "Mike C."}

You would think that at 10pm there would be no 30 minute-wait for a table, but for a place like Ryoko's in a city that doesn't offer much late night eats, 30 minutes wasn't too bad in my book.\n\nOverall I would this place has great value. Sushi on the east coast tends to be marked up a little bit. Everything on Ryoko's menu was moderately ranged, with the occasional specialty rolls maxing at $15 per roll.\n\nFor a table of three, we had ordered a total of 4 rolls (from the $8 - $13 range), 12 pieces of sashimi, a hot appetizer, and a large bottle of unfiltered Sake. The Salmon Sashimi was super buttery (in a good way). My favorite roll would have been the VOLCANO. For our hot appetizer, I chose the DEEP FRIED BABY OCTOPUS and could have not picked a better choice, it was so crunchy! \n\nPROS:\n+ Fish quality is very very good.\n+ Full bar\n\nCONS:\n- Sporadic server presence. No one was there to refill our water cups. When we were ready to order, to ask for drinks, to get our check: no one was around.\n- i got a whiff of old carpet and basement smell for a hot sec when I was first seated.\n\nSIDE NOTE:\nI wasn't used to one-sized sushi rolls for all the different prices ranges. Each roll we had ordered had the same amount of pieces per roll, the same size in diameter, and all the rolls were rolled with the rice on the inside.  With that said the quality of the ingredients were really why the prices are different, which how it should be anyways.\n\nFood: 4.0\nService: 3.0\nAmbiance: 3.5\nValue: 4.0", "author": "Jennifer M."}

This restaurant does not take reservations so we had to wait a good hour to grab a seat. After waiting an hour we were seated in a private room with another group which was a not so good decision. We ordered our drinks food etc. it took about 30 min to get water and the bday girls food arrived but not anyone else's. So then my food arrived and my other gf waited another 30 min for hers. The food in general was just so beyond inconsistent it was ridiculous. The waitress would only drop off the orders then u would never see her again in the steam pot of a room, all we had was a fan. The hype about this place is just a bit shocking considering there was not even anything crazy about it the sushi was just bleh, I wanted to order her a birthday dessert but after waiting so long some people being full more than others and the company we were over Ryokos and decided to dip out asap! And go to another restaurant.", "author": "Gabriella S."}

After a long day of exploring San Francisco with my friend, we were both in the mood for some great Japanese food and we were definitely not disappointed. First of all, the atmosphere was great. It was lively, everyone was having a great time, and it was just a great experience overall! We got there right before the line got really long so expect a wait if you come during rush times. My friend wound up getting two sushi dishes and I got chicken teriyaki and tempura dishes. All of the food was really delicious so there were no complaints there! We were both just in a really good mood throughout the dining experience because the place was so lively and if you're looking for good Japanese restaurants close to Union Square, Ryoko's is definitely the place.", "author": "Michael L."}

You know it's delicious because despite also being frequented by hipsters, drunken club closers, and foodies, there are a surprising number of native Japanese willing to brave the crisp San Francisco winds for some fresh off the boat specials. And I cannot say I'm surprised as this place has something for everyone to love: with monkfish and mackerel, as well as other Japanese delicacies, to fried soft shell and philly rolls. The ingredients are super fresh and the service, while not speedy, is plain good.  As other reviewers have noted, this place isn't cheap but for SF it's on the better side of decent for cost and definitely a value in quality. Not the best neighborhood, but such is the spice of life. This place remains a go-to staple for me when I find myself in SF.", "author": "Adina P."}

A few years ago I was a regular at Ryokos, but moved and this would be my first time back. Sadly this spot has become very touristy and boarder line cluby. Maybe that part of the review is because I am getting older. However, the sushi rolls are not the same either. The rolls I order were cut unevenly, huge piece at the end so you have to cut it to fit it in your mouth. And when I walked out I looked at the sushi bar and they had pre-cut salmon sashimi\u200b, that was all piled up and not looking very appetizing.

I always get random numbers...remember last week? I asked for our taxi cab driver's number so we can hook up L.\"\n\nMr. NSS: \"Yes...but baby, you're not Patti Stanger so please stop trying to play matchmaker.\"\n\nIt's been nearly four months since I been to Ryoko's but what better reminder than last night's incident for me to finally write a review.\n\nFirst things first, don't come to Ryoko's without a reservation. We had reservations for the sushi bar for Sunday night at 6 pm. We walked into a half empty restaurant only to later have a swarm of tourists and foreign exchange students anxiously waiting on the stairway gawking at us as techno music blared in the background. Definitely feels like eating in an underground 90s club with cramped tables and a wobbly staircase to the bathroom upstairs. Needless to say, this is not the best date place unless you plan to get your date drunk with sake bombs and take her to the nearest Motel 6. \n\nDon't be surprised if you're the only local here which may explain the pricier than usual menu (e.g. Rainbow Roll is $20).\n\nI've said this a million times (or at least it feels like it) but the only way to go at a sushi restaurant is omakase or order from the \"White Board Specials\": http://bit.ly/11Qa3KI. We requested that Atsushi-San, our awesome sushi chef create an Nigiri Omakase ($50 minimum) for us and gave him a budget of $60 a person.\n\nFor the Nigiri Omakase, we each received 10 pieces consisting of Hirame (Fluke/Flounder), Mebachi Maguro (Big Eye Tuna), Hamachi Toro (Yellowtail Belly), Wild Sockeye Salmon, Uni (Sea Urchin), and Tamago (Egg Omelet): http://bit.ly/VGzZ4j. Additionally, we received Aji (Horse Mackerel) w/ Fried Carcass: http://bit.ly/14VjGaH, and Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp): http://bit.ly/YWDcDf w/ Fried Heads: http://bit.ly/WRov1r. \n\nThe nigiri was good but not spectacular especially for the price. All the fish was fresh and the shari were nice bundles of seasoned rice but each mouthful was not *eyes roll back into your head* orgasmically buttery. However, my favs of the night were the sockeye salmon (the buttery-est of them all) and sweet amaebi with accompanying deliciously crunchy heads. I didn't care for the watery guacamole-like wasabi though. \n\nI'm not a fan of jive ass rolls but we ordered one as a filler since we were still hungry. The Orange Delight Roll ($13) was f*cktastic: http://bit.ly/VZMNVx. Atsushi-san was kind enough to top the avocado and cucumber roll with fatty slices of salmon belly (instead of regular salmon) which made each bite sublime. Silky, and intensely buttery, this was the BEST roll I've ever had and definitely made our visit to Ryoko's worthwhile even though we initially came for the omakase. \n\nThe staff was super sweet and you won't find a pretty solid sushi place that's open till 2 am so 4 solid stars for Ryoko's. Side note: If you're looking for the best sushi in SF (Japanese owned), head over to Ino (J-town), Koo (Inner Sunset) or Okina (Inner Richmond). \n\nBe forewarned though, Ryoko's is NOT a place to come drunk because you can easily run up the tab to $100-$150+ a person or end up with random business cards/numbers like \"some\" people...\n\n*Embarrassingly hides face with jacket*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The venue is in a basement with hip decor and pretty good EDM music. This restaurant is known for it's creative sushi rolls, like the jalape\u00f1o peanut butter volcano roll and the salmon mango avocado Pokemon roll. Delicious. However, if you're looking for simpler classic rolls for a nice dinner, you might want to look elsewhere. If you want creative rolls up until 2am, this is your place!\n\nI was greeted by Jenny, a lively lovely Thai waitress who sat me at my table and took my order. When I asked for some recommendations, she suggested I start with the fried baby octopus (Iidako) and suggested some rolls, including the special for tonight, the Eli roll which is the regular tiger roll (avocado and shrimp tempura) but with spicy tuna on top. My reviews of the rolls are below:\n\nThe fried baby octopus was crispy and chewy and not too salty, so it was nice that I could add as much soy sauce and lemon (which it came with) to flavor it how I wanted it.\n\nThe Pokemon roll has avocado, salmon, and mango in it but somehow the flavors didn't work together super well. I think the salmon was fresh and the mango was sweet but possibly not ripe enough. Still not bad.\n\nThe volcano roll that so many others have mentioned makes the jalape\u00f1o peanut butter combo work really well, though these are the strongest flavors, whereas the shrimp tempura and roe are still more subtle in the background.\n\nNext was the flying Tuna roll which is totally tempura'd on the outside. It's a really savory roll with lots of flavor from the grilled tuna and japanese mayo in the middle, which finishes with a crunch from the tempura. I think the outside could be a bit fresher though.\n\nThe special Eli roll was really aesthetically pleasing and packed with flavor. Even without the sriracha mayo sauce on the side, the spicy tuna was really fresh and flavorful and worked well with the shrimp tempura flavor and avocado. It was a filling and enjoyable combination of raw fish and tempura shrimp.", "author": "Simon Z."}

If you are patient enough to get seated, most likely the food will not disappoint.  This place is underground and will transport you to Tokyo (or NY) with its ambiance.  Intimately lit, tightly packed, Ryoko's offers the nice glow of warm chatter.  Beers were always cold, and sakes always warm.  Sushi itself was standard quality for SF, definitely competitive with surrounding shops.  There are better options around for izakaya.  I like that this place offers everything in one stop, so there is something for everyone whether its alcohol, sushi, or hot plates.  Service was terrific, and even though it was crowded it never felt short staffed and we never felt pressured to leave.  Really enjoyed the experience here, not just the food.\n\nPROTIP:  Try the monkfish liver.  Incredibly fresh.  Foie Gras of the ocean.", "author": "David C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-24", "description": "So, I don't want to be that guy who complains about waiting in line for a popular restaurant because, as we all know, popular restaurants will have long lines. We should except that. \n\nWhat I didn't expect was being shoved into a hot corner of the restaurant with the only ventilation being a portable fan... the type of fan you buy at Walmart... not even a legitimate ceiling fan. Suffice to say, I was sweating profusely in no time, and the food hadn't even arrived. \n\nDespite the seemingly pointless wait amongst people who probably didn't know any better, the food was not altogether bad. I mean, it probably beats your average fast-food sushi joint in terms of preparation and freshness. The usual characters like Salmon and Yellowtail were reasonably fresh, but not mind-blowing. I could also sense a bit of inexperience with the flavoring of the sushi. A skilled sushi chef will preseason the sushi slightly and recommend the manner in which the sushi should be eaten. I could somewhat detect an effort to flavor the sushi.. but it wasn't significant enough to comment on.\n\nAs for everything else... well, the roll sushi were pretty generic. I mean, a lot of non-sushi eaters tend to gush about how delicious the Dragon roll was, etc etc, when the fact of the matter is that basically all Dragon rolls taste the same due to the large amount of spicy mayo that is used to essentially mask the flavor of the fish. I suppose the only way to really screw up a Dragon roll would be to actually mess up the recipe for the spicy mayo...\n\nAt the end of the day also, the price tag was a bit steep... granted, I understand that we ARE in San Francisco, and that we should expect these prices. I'm just saying, we could probably have gotten a much better product in Japan-town LA for a bit less.. and perhaps with better ventilation. \n\nAll in all, an OK experience... though you won't find me going out of my way to come back here next time I am passing through SF.", "author": "David M."}

I had always been against waiting in lines but i do love sushi. I waited forever then finally decided to try the place a couple months ago. I guess It just couldn't live up to the expectations. \n\nThis place is always crowded. It opens around 6pm and stays open late. You should be able to get a seat after 10pm or before 7pm but that is about it. If you are coming with a group larger than two prepare to wait. \n\nYou are greeted by the entire staff when you enter but after that it seems like you become just a number. This place is crowded and it is a very small basement area. You will be right next to your neighbor and intimately in their conversation. I was able to get a table without waiting in line but I can't imagine waiting over an hour to get into this place. They are so busy no one stays with you long enough to ask questions and you are rushed to get the next group of people into your seat. \n\nThe other part is the actual sushi itself. There was nothing to write home about. i ordered several of the basic rolls and I have had better at many places in SF. I just don't understand why this one is so popular and every seems to want to go here. I would never recommend friends to go here especially if you want a lot of sushi because you will be paying an arm and a leg. \n\nIt is a decent sushi spot but that is really all it is. I don't understand the hype but if you feel like going through the motions for decent sushi then this will be worth it. Otherwise just do a quick search of sushi in north beach and thank me later.", "author": "Nick R."}

I came here because I wanted Sushi, was in the area, and it had a 4/5 star review on Yelp. My friend and I waited fifteen minutes to be seated. We thought, why not get a beer or sake while we wait? Turns out you cant do that! Dont think of doing it, unless you want the employees to yell at you for trying to do so! Moreover, we get seated, the waitress takes a really long time to attend to us. When picking out what I want on the menu, the waitress keeps telling me \"today we only have this kind of fish; so it'll be an additional $10 on top of the menu price, is that okay?\"  (She said that for 3 different rolls) That kind of annoyed me. The food was very mediocre, i've had way better sushi and sashimi and at a lower price. I pay by card, leave, then the waitress chases my friend and I outside? It was embarassing because she made it seem like we skipped out on the tab. She's telling us she cant find the merchant copy, which i clearly put in the book? She tells me she needs me to sign another receipt or go back in the restaurant and help her look for it. I give her my receipt, complete the total, give her no tip this time. She says \"you forgot to include the gratuity!\" i told her \"you doing this just lost your tip, no gratuity, goodnight\". Overall, poor service, low quality food, uncomfortable to eat at.

This awesome sushi place gets packed, so we spent a good 20 minutes waiting in line on the stairs going down with several other groups. But, as is often the case, that was half the fun. The staff is great about making sure everyone waiting has a Sapporo to drink while waiting, and everyone's kidding around, so it's lots of fun.\n\nThe sushi is excellent. We had one called the Pokemon that was good, plus salmon skin and crab. They have good saki too, though you get the whole pitcher if you ask for some, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe edamame was also worthy of note, better than probably any other I've had. Then again, maybe it was the beer on the stairs that made it seem so.\n\nIt's a cool, funky atmosphere--dark, with lots of romantic nooks and crannies. Great service, too.

It didn't take too long for the food to come out though, so that was a plus. We ordered a couple of appetizers, two rolls, and a grilled fish. Overall, dinner was fine. Nothing really stood out in a positive way. No wow factor. We stayed away from ordering raw fish due to some recent reviews of fish not being fresh. The rolls we had contained cooked fish/soft shell crab. A negative point was that the music was blaring, which just seemed kinda unnecessary. Why do I need to scream to be heard? Oh one major letdown is that they don't serve ramen or upon. I've never been to a Japanese restaurant that didn't serve at least udon.

A bit disappointing but we went ahead and ordered the edamame, Hamachi and salmon sashimi, saba shioyaki, Alcatraz roll and upon the waitress' suggestion, the wasabi tobiko (hubby likes tobiko). For drinks we ordered a bottle of cold sake. \nOur food didn't take long to arrive. The Hamachi sashimi was okay.  It was fresh but not as smooth of a texture as I'm used to back home. I enjoyed to saba shioyaki as it was grilled very well and seasoned nicely with salt. The wasabi tobiko didn't taste any different from regular tobiko and just cost more. We added another order of regular tobiko sushi to compare and didn't notice any difference. The roll was a bit of a miss for me.

I was really holding out for sushi at least once while in San Francisco and the hotel pointed us down the hill to Ryoko's. \n\nThe entrance is a step down into a dimly lit narrow room. There is a good amount of seating at the bar on the left and then maybe 8 or so tables on the right. It felt like an izakaya, or essentially a japanese gastropub. We sidled up to the bar and got to ordering. \n\nWe tried an assortment of sushi, rolls, and tempura dishes. Everything was very very good. We were both impressed by the freshness of the fish. Furthermore, behind the sushi bar on the wall was a white board of specials flown in same day from Japan. Sushi chefs were very interactive and friendly. They spent time showing us a few special fish and crabs they received from japan that day, including a hulking sea monster crab that I didn't recognize. \n\nFor those reviewing this place as a \"sushi restaurant\" where you're expecting a certain well lit aesthetic and presentation, I think you'll be disappointed.

It was recommended to me by someone who lives in the city, touted as \"the best sushi place in San Fran\". I did read the reviews on Yelp so I wasn't sure how my experience would be.\n\nThe restaurant was just around the corner from my hotel which was convenient. It was approximately 7:30 pm on a Sunday evening and I had to wait for 20 minutes for a table. You walk down a set of stairs and loiter about until it's time to be seated. It's kind of chaotic and the hostess is trying to seat people and lets the name sign-up sheet float around. It looks like a basement, I mean it is a basement, but it's dark and cramped, kind of had a musty odor where I sat. They had bumping music blaring from the speakers because they apparently only have the DJ on certain nights. \n\nI sat for about ten minutes before anyone came over. I ordered a beer and that took another ten minutes to arrive and the server didn't even take my food order, he just flitted away. He did drop off a small bowl of cold edamame with my beer which was on the house, apparently. It was alright, nothing special. The beer was a draft, cost $4.50 which isn't unreasonable at all.\n\nFinally, after I flagged him down another 10 minutes later, I placed my order. I decided to play it safe and order a few things to see how good it was. I had the Flying California roll, two orders of salmon sushi (4 pieces), and an order of gyoza. The Flying California Roll came out first, much to my surprise. I thought the appetizer would come out before the rolls. It was deep fried, with crab and avocado on the inside. It was okay, the tempura batter wasn't too thick but there wasn't much avocado.\n\nAfter I finished that, my salmon sushi came out. They were so small, like the size a freaking carrot stick! Three pieces had no wasabi underneath but one piece had a shitload of it. I had to scrape it off because it was overflowing from underneath the fish. Then ten minutes later I get the gyoza. They were small and greasy, nothing special. \n\nThis place was very disappointing, we have better sushi in Michigan. The service was abysmally slow, the food wasn't good, and it was way too expensive for the tiny portions they give you.", "author": "Megan K."}

Well the opportunity arose, and myself along with a coworker and a couple guys from our conference ventured on over for a little late night snack somewhere between 10 & 11pm ISH.\n\nThe place was packed, with a short wait.  GOOD SIGN?  I thought so... \n\nFirst Impression: small, divey, dark, not dirty - but dingy? (if that makes sense), could use some TLC\n\nNow, let me start by saying. It was all good sushi - I just wasn't blown away or amazed by anything we had.  To be honest, I felt like it was similar to what I can get back home in the Midwest, which left me a little disappointed.. \n\nWe ordered a couple rolls, some sashimi, and of course a couple bottles of Saki.  The staff was very patient with us, as we seemed to be chatting more than deciding on what to eat.  The food came out in a weird order - we ordered the saki and a roll right away while we perused the menu a bit more, the Saki came right away, but that original roll came last out of everything we ordered... which was odd seeing we ordered it probably a good 15 minutes prior to ordering any other food.\n\nNow the burning question... Would I go back?\n\nSadly... probably not.  If i lived in the area I might, but seeing as I don't make it to the SF area often, I will probably look elsewhere next time I'm in town.", "author": "Andi P."}

We ended up going here because some other place that we wanted to go to were full or had a long line/wait. the food we had tasted great: fresh, and tasty. We had the Volcano 5 piece spicy crunchy roll which was great and the 49er roll was good.\n\nThere is not much room in this place to walk around the tables are placed closer together than they should be. When I got up to go to the bathroom I realised how dimly lit it really was. It was hard to see. The bathroom is located upstairs and there was only one for the women's bathroom. \n\nThis place was pretty full on a Saturday night. There was mostly people aged 25-35 here. Some people there for birthdays, catching up with buddies, and dates. Because the tables are so close together it's hard to not hear peoples conversations, the table near us the guys were talking about things guys would usually not talk about around girls. I certainly didn't want to hear that, but there is not much choice when the tables are so close together. A dimly lit place could offer an intimate setting for a couple to have dinner but romance is lost when the tables are so close together, and everyone can hear each others conversations. Personally I think it's more comfortable to be able to eat with my boyfriend and feel comfortable to have an open conversation. I notice that we both talk less in places where people can hear everyone's conversations, but maybe that is just me.", "author": "Tiffany Michelle L."}

Given the grunge, basement vibe, I thought this was going to be a hit.  Everything about it looked promising because the place was nearly full when we arrived shortly after they opened.  Nevertheless, we both had the come hell or high water mentality of eating our weights' worth in sushi when we sat down, certainly so after having our tits handed to us on on the trek there.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best roll I had was the Fried Chicken Roll, which is very much the scumbag poser of any food that is wrapped inside rice.  Everything else ranged from average to tasteless, even more so than any stale wafer made for teething infants or pigeons.  The Scallop Roll had so little meat content and flavor that even a die-hard vegan would eat it.  \n\nThe seaweed salad appetizer that we ordered was one of the most depressing things I have experienced this year.  It didn't hold that much flavor and they put cherry tomatoes piled on top of wilting seaweed.  What a dick move.  Putting cherry tomatoes on a seaweed salad is kind of like rubbing alcohol into a laceration that is on my ass.  \n\nThe second runner-up to the Fried Chicken Roll, and I am honest to god cringing at that sentence, was perhaps the sashimi platter that we ordered.  None of the fish were spectacular but they weren't spoiled, sandy, or poorly butchered.  You know, not a girl, not yet a woman.  Mediocre at its best.  \n\nPerhaps the cherry on top of it all is that our server moved us to another table because we were in the way of them making more money.  That's all good except then I was in plain view to watch and listen to a scrawny, tattooed crapper--whose ego is insurmountable and know-it-all expertise is as sought after as a venereal disease--blabber on and on about his pathetic life.  Yeah, I'm judgmental.  \n\nThis place has a little something for everyone and for that I can appreciate.  However, the menu is exceedingly lengthy and confusion arose out of trying to differentiate one platter from the other and one roll from the other.  It made me momentarily feel like a dumbass and this is why I will likely never visit again.  I also never pass up a chance to showcase my undesirable traits like my misplaced righteous indignation.  \n\nFor how hungry we felt, this place did not hit any of the right spots.  I'd also rather eat at a conveyer belt sushi place than to pay $13+ for unimaginative, uninspired rolls.  Each roll had about 6 small pieces, regardless of the price.

The sashami was excellent but more costly than I have paid at most places and the rolls were cheap- about 5 or 6 pieces each but was it worth the wait- hell no.

Despite it's appetizing name, the sheltered little Asian girl inside of me has prevented me from venturing it's seedy streets once the stars are out. But tonight, that all changed thanks to Ryoko. Because of Ryoko, I might even consider moving to the Tenderloin. \n\nI don't know their reservation policy, all I know is is that they told my boyfriend they don't do them (despite what Yelp says). They open at 6. We got there at 6:25 and it was already at 90% capacity. It's set up in an old house, so quarters are tight, ceilings are low and the music is loud. \n\nLuckily we were just a party of 2 and got to sit at the bar. The beginning of our meal here started off HORRIBLY. We sat there for 20 minutes, completely unacknowledged. The sushi chefs gave us the customary nod upon sitting down, but they were so swamped that they just kept their heads down and hands going. Since we sat there unacknowledged for so long, I noticed my napkin was already used. Gross. Finally a lady instructed our waiter to actually pay attention to us, and while we were ordering we were interrupted THREE TIMES but other servers. The intrusive servers didn't even apologize for being so rude-- they literally stepped in between us and our waiter and started talking to him. I really couldn't believe it. I decided right then and there that service there sucks. They are nice people but incredibly oblivious, like many of my Asian peeps, when it comes to customs regarding interrupting conversations.\n\nThe saving grace of Ryoko is the food. OH. MY. GOD. The fish is stupid fresh. It's like the sushi chefs (who are actually very nice and social when the incoming tickets start slowing down) went out into the marina and sang the fish to sleep only to slaughter them later for my culinary pleasure. They have a menu, but they also have a white board informing you what fish they have fresh from Japan. Unfortunately, the 'good things come to those who wait' bullshit holds true here, because we waited a solid 30 minutes for our food. Prepare to wait longer if you get anything baked or fried, as there are only 3 sushi chefs who do all of the prep and work involved in the sushi.\n\nWe decided on the sashimi dinner ($30.25), chu toro/fatty tuna (2 ps/$13), white tuna toro (2pc/$6.95). Both the nigiri MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. I couldn't even handle it. I nearly fainted. It was THAT good. The fat content would make even Paula Deen swear. The sashimi dinner was INCREDIBLY fresh, I was even stoked about the tuna, which normally doesn't tickle my pickle all that much. We were also drunk by this time thanks to the large Sapporo ($6) and large hot sake ($7) so I was on cloud freaking nine. We ordered an additional dinner of another large Sapporo and sake, Ryoko's Roll ($15--special roll), shima aji (2 pc/$9.30) and hamachi toro (2 pc/$9). I didn't know you could go beyond heaven but apparently ou can. The shima was firm and reminded me of hamachi, and the hamachi toro was nothing short of orgasmic. The Ryoko's roll had cucumber and pickled daikon on the inside, fatty tuna and red onions on the outside. SHUT. UP. YES.\n\nI think I've found my new favorite sushi spot in The Bay.

The plus side is that we didn't wait too long since we got there right at 6pm when the restaurant opened. \n\nThe other plus side is that the sushi was pretty good and very different from your traditional rolls. The down side? We both thought it was a bit pricey for how much we got. The even more down side was the attitude of the waitress. She basically gave us the eye-roll a few times when we asked for things and wasn't too attentive. \n\nAll in all, good place to try creative rolls but I don't think I'd recommend this place.", "author": "Jessica X."}

A girlfriend and I stopped here for dinner on a Thursday night and it was the perfect pick-me-up!\n\nMy favorite dishes:\n+ TAKOYAKI: one of my favorite dishes of the night. It was basically eight large takoyaki balls and they did not skimp on the octopus. The overflowing pile of bonito flakes on top made this a very aesthetically pleasing dish too.\n+ ANKIMO (monkfish liver): mmmm...this is a truly decadent Japanese dish that is different from your typical sashimi, rolls, udon, etc. The scallions and ponzu sauce paired well together with the richness of this dish. My second favorite of the night!\n\nHonestly I would come back again just for the two dishes above. We also tried a few rolls and the toro (fatty tuna), but they were a bit more on the lackluster side. I would recommend coming here for either the chirashi bowls (if you feel like really splurging) or for a quick bite of the takoyaki and ankimo. \n\nThings to note:\n- Come here early!!

As soon as you enter, the entire staff shouts...I'm assuming welcome or hello in Japanese (I'm assuming).  The tables were all taken, so we decided to take two seats at the bar.  We chose a perfect time to arrive before the dinner rush, because once 7pm hit, the place was packed and people were actually sitting on the stairs.\n\nNow to the food.....the sushi was up to par, and very fresh.

I am so glad for that because someone at the table next to us had the nigiri sushi platter after and it looked so disappointing-really poor presentation and selection. \n\nWe ended up ordering several (grilled & deep fried) appetizers, rolls and a la carte nigiri.  Of course, it was obvious that this is not a real traditional Japanese sushi place seeing all those \"special\" rolls on the menu. Still I had hoped the food would be really good even if catered to Americans. Nothing was really great or memorable. For the nigiri, I ordered the fish from on the black board (specials from Japan) which costs more than the fish choices on the menu and it was not great. My bf said he could not taste the fish and asked me if I thought maybe the fish was frozen?

I took this as a good sign, especially for a place serving raw fish. \n\nThe hostess was nice and very accommodating for our large group. She had a large private seating area ready for us when we were called. The ambiance is that of an authentic japanese sushi bar+restaurant. \n\nAs for the dining experience I was left underwhelmed. The waitress taking our order was pressured on time and hesitant to answer questions about the food. Service was slow even for a Friday night.\n\nThe sashimi combo and chirashi combo were both smaller than expected. Of the two, I'd recommend getting the chirashi for the sushi rice. The ochazuke (soup+rice) dish was hearty and filling. The quality of the food was about on par with most mid to low-tier sushi restaurants. Unfortunately, nothing really stood out here. \n\nPros: Fresh fish, location, back rooms excellent for large groups\nCons: Crowded, relatively small portions, service.", "author": "Andrew K."}

On our last night, we were trying to figure out what to do for dinner, and this came up on Yelp that was nearby our hotel and also had great reviews. The restaurant opens for dinner at 6, and that is about the time that we got there. So we did wait about 40-45 mins for sushi bar seating, but that was understandable as it was a full-house and we got there as the first patrons were seated and began their dinners. The waitress/hostess was very nice, though, and took drink orders for the parties waiting for a table. \n\nWhen we got seated, the same waitress/hostess was very prompt with giving us water and taking our orders. She recommended their special for the night, which my husband thought was delicious. Because I am pregnant, I unfortunately couldn't try any of their sashimi or raw sushi rolls :( but everything looked really fresh! Also, the cooked items that I did order did not disappoint! I had the miso soup to start off with, which was very flavorful. I also had their deep fried baby octopus. So yummy! The octopus was cooked perfectly and was not rubbery at all. The batter also was not too thick or bready, which I appreciated. I also ordered the tiger roll (shrimp tempura roll).

Their salmon onigiri is a decent to generously sized (depending on the chef on duty) rice ball with a good chunk of a grilled salmon fillet inside, and I order two of these along with a meat dish for a good time. Be sure to get here at 6 when they open if you don't feel like waiting though- after the first 20 minutes this place gets PACKED all the way up the stairs to the door!

I mean it is nice that it is open till 2am, but for what we got and the price, it wasn't worth it at all. We got a crunchy crab, amaebi and sake nigiri, and a chirashi totaling to about $60 (crazy). It wasn't the usual slices of fish over a bed of rice- it looked more like bara chirashi where they were just leftover scraps of fish all tossed into a bowl- a very messy presentation and expensive ($31). The amaebi head tasted better than the shrimp itself..which isn't supposed to be the case. The salmon nigiri was ok. I will admit that the salmon was  buttery which I liked, but I don't appreciate my fish being luke warm like it was popped in a microwave, prior to being served to me. Crunchy crab didn't look appetizing- looked as if it was just cut up and messily thrown on a plate. Wasabi looked/tasted very old to the point that it was starting to turn a bit hard and brown (gross)\n\nThe space inside is very cramped, so for people that are kind of claustrophobic, it would probably give you anxiety. We sat at a table and were only about 3 inches away from the couple next to us- really awkward and uncomfortable. Pretty dim inside but that is about it.  It is for the younger crowd so it isn't really a classy place, it was also cool that they sorta placed electronic/ house music (yay)\n\nService: waiters were pretty oblivious to your needs unless you flagged them down. It was also hard to get them to refill the cups. \n\nI was planning originally on 2 stars, but this made me bump to one. When they sat us and placed napkins on the table for us, there was in insect that was crawling around. I know it's not a cockroach but that is the first thing i thought of when I saw it scurrying.

I seriously have never been here before 11pm. Now I haven't been everywhere, but after eating around, regardless of the time I still enjoy Ryoko's sushi more than anywhere else so far. \n\nTo me, the quality of the nigiri and rolls are better than other places. The way the fish is sliced, the quality of that fish, the size of the nigiri rice, etc., all contribute to my kind of sushi experience. They're not big fat rolls, or thick slices of fish. I like that. In the context of sushi I prefer smaller and delicate than heavy-handed technique and portions.\n\nBecause it's a smaller place, they don't have a huge variety of fish. The usual suspects and a few \"specials\" on their board. I always make an effort to try things from that board but often by the time I get there they're sold out. At the hours I frequent it's understandable. \n\nIn my sushi experience  (albeit limited), it's been the best o-toro, chu-toro, and Hamachi toro. One night it was fun to try regular hamachi, hamachi toro, and wild hamachi toro side by side by side. Sometimes the have kobe beef tataki, sometimes the guys will make something not on the menu. I rarely have had something there I don't like. \n\nIt's not cheap but sushi isn't cheap.

We just didn't want to waste the fish, but oh well.  The dish came with a bowl of rice and miso soup, we only ate 6 pieces of the fish when it came with 14 (maguro, sake, hamachi, tako, hotate, and mackerel)\n- Nigiri:  Amaebi (mediocre, the fried heads were so greasy it made me sick), Salmon (a little fishy, but manageable), Maguro (flavorless and tough texture), Mackerel (couldn't even eat it because of the smell), Uni (not terrible, but the size of your thumb), Hamachi (I spit it out because the texture freaked me out and it tasted fishy), Tobiko, Tamago, and Unagi (tasted like eel sauce).\n- A couple rolls: No comment from me because my other friends got them, but they said they weren't very good\n\nMy friends were so shocked and embarrassed, they were convinced that it was a new chef!  We asked the waitress and she immediately got defensive and just smiled and said, \"Management has not changed, sorry you didn't like food.\"\n\nThat's fine, not her fault and we don't blame any of the waiter/waitresses but the last lady that came in to check in on us.  I can't even explain how... rude she was.  She kept saying, \"Oh yeah I don't know, so sorry.  So so sorry.\" With the most sarcastic tone I've ever heard... AND I'M SUPER SARCASTIC!

Ryokos was packed...cool music, food looked killer, everyone clearly enjoying themselves. Stoked! Yelpers have thankfully set expectations about wait long times and I've got plenty of time to wait for a table. Looking forward to great food and a cold beer.\n\nWith ~10 people camped on the stairs, guessing a 30min wait. 15min go by and servers are busy with tables so haven't talked to any staff yet. A couple walks in and takes a stair behind me. Server walks up and takes a couple to their table. After 20 minutes a guy walks in, nudges himself down the stairs and takes a clipboard off a hook (that I couldn't see past the people in front of me) and writes his name down (?) and stands by the clipboard. The other people waiting seem to notice see this and go back to their conversations. Okay...\n\n'Hmmm, maybe I'm supposed to add myself to that list...\". At this point of enlightenment another group walks in, and one of their party squeezes down straight to the clipboard and starts writing. Server walks up, takes clipboard, checks list and asks who is (fill in name) and begins scanning for a table for them.  Now I realize that both me and at the couple behind me are 1) clueless to the 'locals only' self-service clipboard and 2) will not get a table before midnight due to our ignorance. That's fine...live & learn.\n\nThe epiphany that automatically compelled me to walk out and find another sushi spot was knowing that the ~8 people that were on the stairs when I walked in didn't bother to speak up and suggest that I might want to grab the clipboard and put my name down.  Wow \n\nI'm a 35-year Californian and moved to Idaho 10 years ago. I miss the food most of all. While we have nothing like Ryokos in Boise, our locals do remember how to pass good energy to strangers. All things being equal...had I walked in to the same Ryokos in Boise on a crowded night, someone would have tapped my shoulder and pointed out that clipboard.  \n\nSorry there's no food review here. I wish I could have tried the sushi...but no thanks San Francisco. Peace.", "author": "Jim H."}

Saw that this place had delicious looking amaebi so we were sold.\n\nGot there, four people were waiting at the bottom on the stairs. We put our names on the clipboard.  Two assholes walk in and just stand there.  Then when the waitress calls us for our table, they had the nerve to say they were there before us but just didn't put their name down.  These assholes were not waiting outside, as there was nobody outside when we came in.  Regardless waitress decided to honor the assholes.  Not that pissed since i didn't want to be at the bar anyways, but just saying there are plenty of ramen places in NY where those stupid clipboard lists are treated like gold.  Not this place apparently.\n\nOrdered the amaebi which was delicious.  Order other fish, nothing spectacular.  Tried some oysters, they could be fresher and better seasoned.  Ordered the checkerboard roll just for kicks, but I feel ripped off.\n\nNot that special.  Service was bad, took forever to get our waitress to get us the check.  Food came in random order.  How do you get your Amaebi heads before you've had amaebi?  Rolls come before Fish?

Should there be female fans in attendance who are quite inebriated, might mistake him for Takeshi Kaneshiro from Sleepless Town \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycevahHdZCM\n\nand fall prey to potential drunk ordering (which can be lethal on the wallet) as he recommends in perfect Japanese accented English, white board $pecial$ that will be like seductive words of sweet luvins after some shots and bottles of Sapporo (probably from Canada).\n\nPrime real estate location with a chit ton of foot traffic (especially tourists and out of towners, and of course those people who cannot live without sushi), plus the fact that this place closes at 2 am (last order circa 1:45 AM)...being the only place in NorCal that I know of at least, where you can get non douchey sushi past midnight, is not too shabby otherwise, and thus the rounded up 4 rating (~3.5 for the food). Just don't expect Koo, Kazu, Aka Tombo, Ino, Sebo, or Murasaki and you will do just fine.\n\nThe food? Oh yeah:\n\nShirauo (appetizer) - this was listed on the white board but they didn't offer it as sushi. Shirauo is Japanese ice fish, kind of like conger eel larvae, thin little transparent white swimmies (no not THAT kind) with dotty black eyes. A typical and classic Edomae sushi topping (either steamed in a little salt water, or served raw with ginger and a little scallion in gunkan form). N00b a$$ me for ordering this when peak season is Mar - May... Atsushi-san garnished this in a cocktail glass, a little ginger, scallion, and....a raw egg yolk?! After mixing it together, it didn't taste so good.\n\nAnkimo appetizer - a few very mushy soft slices of monkfish liver...in fact a bit too mushy on the edges, with some mixed greens on the side. Ino and Sebo have nothing to worry about.\n\nAssorted nigiri, chef's choice, aka \"let the chef sock it to me baby surprise\". \n\nAji (horse mackeral, with enough pairs ordered to use a whole fish, with carcass salted and deep fried)\nhirame konbu jime (kelp marinated hirame)\nmebachi maguro (big eye red tuna)\nhamachi toro (aka farmed yellowtail belly, seared)\nwild sockeye salmon\nuni (sea urchin gonads)\ntamgoyaki (egg omlette)\namaebi (raw spot prawns with fried head on the side)\n\nBetter sushi rice than most Chinese and Korean run sushi places, but still not my quite my style.\n\nAnd for the helluvit, Orange Delight roll ....seared farmed salmon (with skin on) over an inside out roll of cucumber and avocado. I have to say this is one of the smallest and most expensive jive ass rolls I ever had, but it was actually tasty for what it was.\n\nDecent spot for hanging out with friends late night and having a craving for raw fish over rice. Izakaya Mai in San Mateo has \"sushi\" at $1.50 per piece that opens till midnight on most nights, but it's run of the mill stuff and nowhere near as good...whereas it's a bit more extreme here in terms of price...where you pay a premium here for real estate and late hours.", "author": "Ken K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-15", "description": "On our last night in San Francisco, I was hankering for something other than Katana-Ya. Don't get me wrong, as much as it was delicious every trip, I wanted a bit of variety to my meal! Just down the block was Ryoko, a sushi bar, and what seemed to be a local favorite after my constant search for what to eat on my trip.\n\nOnce you enter, you walk down into a basement suite of pop music, loud laughter, and boisterous orders being called between bartenders. Although not specified anywhere, I definitely consider it an izakaya, a Japanese \"pub\" where food is to go with sake and drinks. We were tired from the day's trip and the atmosphere of the restaurant definitely elevated my mood!\n\nComplimentary edamame beans  started the night off in the right direction. Boiled fresh and generously salted, I was addicted and ordered another dish ($3.50 the second time around), which was considerably larger than our first plate.\n\nJoe had developed a habit of ordering seaweed salad at every Japanese restaurant we went to, and it went the same for Ryoko. Although it wasn't the crunchy one he preferred, it was well seasoned with sesame dressing.\n\nThe appetizer menu looked delicious and suitable for sharing over a round of drinks, but I was hankering some sushi. Ordering the salmon, red tuna, and hamachi served it's purpose for me. Fresh cut sashimi, adequately portioned for the rice, with a hint of wasabi in between - win! The rice is something to comment on although I'm not quite sure what to say of it. It's different from your regular sushi rice, with a hint of light brown coloration. Perhaps the marinade is different because I didn't think it was anywhere close to brown rice. Other than the color though, the rice was slightly warm and cooked perfectly for sushi.\n\nTo go with our nigiri, we also ordered a spicy scallop, hot tuna, and jumping tuna roll. With two full pages of rolls, the selection is extensive and ranged from your basic keppa rolls to elaborate deep-fried maki. The jumping tuna roll was my favorite, spicy tuna, cucumber, and shiso rolled and deep-fried in a light tempura batter. Usually fried rolls are made larger to hold its shape, but there were perfect bite-sized pieces. The spicy scallop and hot tuna were done in the traditional roll style and were delightful. Loosely rolled (some may prefer a tighter package to prevent spills), the highlight of the roll was definitely the use of fresh seafood and lightly seasoned marinades.\n\nI absolutely loved this place, both for atmosphere and for the food. Reasonably priced, great service, and great food - all I can ask for! We were there on a Monday night so the wait was a mere couple of minutes, but it was a hot spot nevertheless. I would presume you would need to come early on Friday and weekend nights and don't expect reservations as I noticed a clipboard where you wrote your own name and table size up at the front. With a live DJ on Friday and Saturday nights, a piano right in the middle of the bar area, and open late 7 days a week until 2 AM, no wonder locals love this place!", "author": "Cindy N."}

This spot was kinda hard to find with my GPS system and passed it up a couple of times. As we got the the entrance, there was a stairway that lead to a basement like area.

I don't know where does the uni come from. I've tried uni from Hokkaido and santa barbara, none of them are that expensive. Plus the seaweed was soggy!!!!\u3000\nAbout the on house Edamame, it was cold, like they got it from costco's fridge.\nThe soy sauce was so salty, even with me who has high tolerance.\nThey fried amaebi's head without clean the gut properly, you can see the black stuff after they fried and it didn't taste good.\n\nI don't understand all the good reviews, this place is so overrated. All in all, the food doesn't worth the wait, I won't come back. :(", "author": "Eric L."}

This restaurant is underground and totally hip. What sucks is they don't take rezzys. Thus, I recommend you walk here and wait outside 10 mins before it opens. Then you will be guaranteed a spot when the restaurant opens. :)\n\nWe waited outside in line for 10 mins before it opened and were immediately seated when the restaurant opened. \n\nAtmosphere: The sushi chefs warmly yell at you in Japanese welcoming you. Its very cute and welcoming. Overall, this place is loud and has TVs everywhere. I also think people just talk loud here and since its underground, the sound is kept well within the restaurant.\n\nFood and Drinks: Their rolls are fantastic. I think we got a dragon roll and rainbow roll. You should also ask for the special. They always have something special, whether its from Santa Barbra or Japan-- your pick, its all very fresh. Since it was Valentine's Day weekend, my boyfriend and I also got drinks to celebrate. And boy, were those drinks strong! I got a peach mojito. At first sip, it tasted so strong ( which is why I got drunk later) but I realized  you have to stir the drink.... Other than that, the drink was great. In addition, I think we also got their Japanese chicken wings, which were crispy, hot and tasty. SO GOOD I LOVE IT.\n\nThis place is awesome.

I'm more into authentic style Nigiri sushi so I have a bias against rolls.\n\nanyways this place seems to cater to a crowd that enjoys Americanized sushi with their rolls not showcasing the flavor of the fish and letting all the other flavors that make their rolls unique do the heavy lifting. \n\nI would recommend this place to people who are afraid to dive in to sushi and find it too exotic. The rolls here remind you of familiar flavors while adding just a bit of exotic flavors. So if you are new to sushi but don't wanna jump in go authentic getting a mouthful of intense fish flavors try this place first. \n\nof their rolls I think the pokemon stood out well for me showcasing the fish flavor and complimenting it's savory flavor with the sweetness of the mango. \n\npeople are saying the fish here is really fresh and maybe I should come back again and try the Nigiri even though it's on the pricier side but not too pricy with a salmon Nigiri at $6. \n\nAll in all i feel their rolls need to be more unique.  it has its staple rolls all other sushi bars have and a some unique but not very complicated rolls that won't really blow your mind.", "author": "Myk S."}

They pride themselves on some rarer Japanese imports, and the toro we sampled did not disappoint. Well worth the price. \n\nThe rolls are also great. It's so refreshing to see a spin on spicy sushi that isn't a mass of less-than-fresh fish in a less-than-spicy mass of mystery mayo. The marinated spicy sushi is fresh and delicious, with a nice little kick. Veggies used within are also very fresh, and all of the rolls we had were light and flavorful. \n\nPrices in general were completely reasonable for the level of quality, and service was hectic, but solid.

I've never had a single bad thing here. And the staff! The staff is amazing - they're friendly and attentive. Atsushi has to be my fav though, master sushi chef, always happy to explain what something is and welcomes the opportunity for you to tell him how hungry you are and let him take the wheel. His creations are great and if you get to know him, he remembers what you like and incorporates that into something unique and delicious! My only recommendation is that you try and get there at 6pm and line up with everyone else trying to get the first seating.

Came here on Saturday around 6pm, and there was plenty of room, a line started forming at the door around 6:30 so try to arrive earlier if you want to avoid the wait.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- giant clams\n- some white tuna thing on their specials board\n- salmon nigiri\n- jumping tuna\n-  ameibi (sweet shrimp)\n\nI enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered, the fish was of the freshest I've had in a while, and my favorite part was that they give you fresh wasabi (might only come with certain dishes, this came with the tuna we ordered on their specials board). \n\nWhen i saw the jumping tuna roll on the menu, I almost passed since I've been trying to stay away from deep fried foods, but all the Yelp reviews said it was a must so I decided why not. Well, I'm glad i tried this roll, it was very well flavored and came with a special dipping sauce, which I'm pretty sure got overpowered by the excess amount of wasabi and soy sauce i use, but nonetheless the roll was still amazing; any of the \"Jumping\" rolls are a must try!\n\nThe atmosphere is small but nice, they blast trance/house music so it gives a nice vibe for the younger crowd. \n\nAdded to my list of favorite sushi spots in SF :)", "author": "Angela K."}

Also the space is hot and stuffy. The meal was fantastic though, and prices were very reasonable. \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant and there was a short line going down the entry steps - we took this as a good sign. After a few minutes, a man entered behind us and we watched him walk down the staircase and write his name on a clipboard. Minutes later, the hostess arrived and called for him - that's when we realized we had to write our names down in order to get seated. We were a little frustrated but we kindly clued in those behind us in line. Just know that if the place is busy, you better get your name on that list. \n\nWe waited for roughly 45 minutes. We could tell there was poor communication between the servers and the owner/manager - they would often call for the wrong people on the list and we had to correct them. Eventually we were seated and the space, though hot, is relatively quiet. You are very close to your neighbors so be prepared to have your conversation overheard. \n\nWe ordered miso soup and edamame, both very good, and four different rolls. My favorite was the Jumping California - it came with a delicious sweet and hot sauce and it was warm from the fryer - absolutely wonderful. We also tried Tahoe, 49er's, and Spicy Golden Gate. Very fresh fish and reasonably priced. \n\nOverall the meal was right what we were looking for. Our waitress was kind and attentive once we were seated and our food arrived in a timely fashion. Only major cons were the experience when we entered the restaurant while waiting to be seated and the heat of the basement. Would definitely return to this spot when visiting SF.", "author": "Liz B."}

The soy sauce on the table was mixed with water so it didn't have any flavor it's like dipping your sushi in water. Also the food quality is poor.

We ate a few sushi orders, the Pokemon roll (trust me the name is a lot more cute that'll you'd expect ) , the deep fried soft shell crab, a bottle of cold sake - $70 later we were still hungry.

I found this place on yep, you guessed it, Yelp! Not too far from the hotel I was staying at I jumped in a cab and headed here.  Secret sushi speakeasy should be it's name because if you didn't know about this place it would be super unassuming.\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar since that was the only space and sho' enough as soon as we sat down about 20 people came in right after and had to wait in line (suckas). The free edamame was awesome though not the best or most fresh, but, it was free so this gal ain't gonna complain too much.\n\nMy plus one and I ordered the sashimi plate and a few rolls including one of their deep fried rolls. So, the sashimi plate made me realize that I really don't like sashimi. I like the tuna of course and the salmon but, the other wierd ass fishies/tentacles I really just don't enjoy that much. I still ate it but, why, why, do I try to convince myself that I'm this sashimi samurai when I'm just not? Regardless, it was good, freshy and meaty but, one better be somewhat adventurous since it is Chef's selection.\n\nThe rolls were solidly good and I enjoyed them, nothing to write home about but, nonetheless they were tasty. As I mentioned above I also went with one of their deep fried rolls - the jumping unagi.  It was interesting but, I don't think I would ever order it again. It didn't taste like a roll at all since it had a crispy, oily, sweet outter crunch that most definitely took away from the fish. The concept could have been amazing but I think in actuality it doesn't really satisfy the dream.\n\nOverall,  four stars since this place is cool as hell and I would definitely recommend.  I'll probably not come back since I don't visit SF that often and when I do I want to try different spots. Glad I got the opportunity to check this spot off my SF bucket list.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

You would hear screams from all over the restaurant in Japanese by the waiters and waitresses. The environment is really dim and mellow.. dim red lights.. It was like a mix of Mexican and Japanese to me.. I don't know why, maybe because of the pictures they had framed on the walls.\n\nThe wait for the food took a bit, since they brought everything to us at once.

Spicy Golden Gate - 4 spicy and crunchy at the same time!\n6. Checkerboard 2 - meh, kinda forgot which one it was\n\nOverall though, I didn't think this place was TOO special. We weren't full and they charged us for $2 for tea! The sushi had interesting names but it wasn't to die for. The environment was a 3 out of 5. They almost sat us at a table that reached only up to our knees, I saw the table next to us disregard the chair and end up sitting on the floor instead. No thanks.

It will be a pretty decent amount of wait depending on the time of the night. On my recent visit, I had a Rainbow and Spicy Golden gate sushi rolls. I had the rainbow sushi roll before and I remember it being at least 10 pieces (or more) and even had a hard time finishing it since it was more than I thought. Since I was pretty hungry, I ordered it and got seven pieces of rolls. I was astounded upon seeing it since it costs 20 dollars and all I had was seven tiny pieces. Even the spicy golden gate roll barely had rice around it. I know its SF, and food is pretty pricey but I think this just went over the top. I usually don't complain about the price knowing that it will be a really good food but this is just crazy. I even confirmed it to the server and he told me that's just how it goes.

We waited for about 40 minutes but we got our table. It was right after a birthday night so frankly, we all were exhausted. We opted for green tea (not your typical St. Patrick's Day drink) and were quite eager to call it a night. When the bill came, it was about $79. I was like woah!

I was still hungry after...\n\nAt this point, I just wanted to go home. I think that the bill was a little pricey but I just want to sign and peace out. My friend got charged $26, the other got charged $36, and then I got charged $36. I don't think we noticed we weren't charged the same thing (who look's at their friend's bill all nosey...right? You just trust that the people can divide by 3...) \n\nMy friend woke up on her walk home and was like we got over charged! She called the restaurant and said that she and her friend (me) got overcharged by $10. My friend lives down the block so she easily went in the next day and the people were super nice! They refunded her her money and settled the case. \n\nI then manage to take 2 buses to get back to the restaurant and finally make it by Tuesday! \n1) They asked for an itemized receipt...what? I only have my signed copy...\n2) The manager told me that the case was already settled. Uh yea! With my friend, but she called for me too! \n3) I said the bill was $79 and 79 divided by 3 is $26! Then the manager says \"I remember the bill being $90 something\n\nOKAY...let's do some math...\n\nIf you refunded my friend $10 from $36...that leaves you with $26 + $26 + my supposed $36 DOES NOT EQUAL $90 SOMETHING!

ANd I was like wouldn't the prices between the three of us be equal SINCE WE SPLIT THE BILL?!?!?!\n\nAnyway, she said she would go to the \"corporate offices\" and inquire about my $10.

Japanese baseball players are know to stop by after playing the Giants.  I've even seen Manny Ramirez (hate LA, but he's actually a nice guy) \n\nI have tried some 25-30 different sushi rstrnts since coming to SF 3 years go and this is pretty much my fav. The thing is its not upscale (blue walls and basement), often long lines, and gets little loud with the DJ on wknds, but its worth it!! In fact, its kinda cool! \n\nWhat should you order?  That's easy!\n\nDon't stare too long at the menu, just look up at the board (fish from Japan, Spain, Brazil, ,Seattle, where ever), that what's fresh and good for the day.  I can't pronounce all the names, but just ask and someone will guide you to happiness. \n\nIndeed, everyone has their test of a great sushi place and mine is their saba (mackerel).  Its takes a great curing liquid to make great saba (he still won't tell me what it in). My friend's test is the salmon skin roll...guess what, it rocks!   \n\nNevermind that seasoning the sushi rice is redone if its not just right.  The gyoza is handmade and a family recipe. No one folds the tamago (egg) except the head chef. The sake selection is biased toward the regions with the best water. If you want the collar (kama) of whatever fish, just ask and they might have one left. Amaebi comes perfectly butterflied, and few minutes later the head comes out lightly batter and deep-fried crispy, the prefect little snack while finishing your sake or beer.  \n\nPost Script: \nIf you must do maki rolls, try the hot tuna, hot tail, jumping tuna, peanut butter roll (try it, it somehow works).  OR ask for the \"special roll\". Its not on the menu and basically only made by the chef who created it (hope he's there that night).

All were fine and all, but what disappointed me was that it took close to a whole grueling hour before I finally received any food... Not to mention that the actual hiyayako dish that I ordered is quite literally two simple cuts of chilled tofu with bits of garnish on top. Does it really take that long to prepare hiyayako? I thinketh not!\n\nOtherwise, the ochazuke was probably my favorite among the appetizers. Tasty, homey, and perfect in either the pickled plum or salmon variation. Another very simply prepared dish.\n\nThe servers were very nice and apologetic. Although Ryoko's takes forever and ever to push out the grub, I believe in second chances... I'll probably be back for another round of ochazuke if I'm ever craving it again... but perhaps not at vampire hours and with a severe grumbling belly. Booooo...", "author": "Ann S."}

We were served up some delicious rolls, and I tried a bit of monk fish liver, the foie gras of the sea. Although it was delightful, I felt a bit of guilt consuming it and I wouldn't likely order it again. \n\nThe following night, after voluminous amounts of drinking at very establishments around San Fran, we found ourselves back at Ryoko's for round number 2. This time we arrived just before close, and sat at the bar. The gentlemen behind the bar were thrilled for me to speak the word \"omakase\" and he proceeded to illuminate my taste buds behind what I thought possible. I was hammered but I vaguely recall glorious  octopus ceviche (only to be topped on my trip to Ecuador) and a bountiful cornucopia of nigiri.\n\nRyoko's, I am a satisfied customer.", "author": "Ben B."}

When the bill came I decided to use a visa gift card I'd got as a birthday gift last year. I double checked the balance before dinner, there was  $150.00 on the card. My bill total was about $138.00 I gave the gift card to the waitress she came back and said she was only able to run it for $125.00 I asked if she was sure because I had double checked before dinner, she said yes. I thought it was simply because visa cards potentially had some type of limit per transaction. I payed the remaining balance in cash and also left a $40 tip which now I'm kicking myself for because this morning after checking the charges on the card, it shows they did run the card for the full $150.

Definitely fresh fish, enjoyed the very Japanese feel.\n\nFood: 4.5/5 - had the sashimi plate (octopus, mackerel, scallop, red tuna, hachibi, and salmon for that night) and added on some toro (fatty tuna) sashimi. You can tell that their sashimi slices are fresh and that they only use the best because their octopus sashimi wasn't chewy or tasteless but well textured and tasty (in fact THE tastiest tako sashimi I've ever had). Also, their red tuna wasn't too pasty but held together great when eaten. All their other sashimi pieces were incredibly fresh, and well presented! Their toro also came in large slices and I was well pleased with their cut and tenderness of the fatty tuna :). Not exactly pasty like red tuna, not exactly buttery like salmon, but perfectly in between with the added hint of the fish fat flavor. I can't give this a fiver because I wasn't able to sample more items from other sections of their menu, but definitely some of the freshest sashimi I've ever had the opportunity to try.\n\nCost: 4/5 - you get what you pay for nothing more, nothing less. Can be on the pricy side for some, but they say the fish comes freshly imported from Japan! \n\nService: 3.5/5 - this place is packeddddddd so their servers are busy busy busy. Could be nicer, could speak better english had some trouble understanding what they said.... But they were attentive and once we were able to sit down the food came quickly for a restaurant that was operating at 100% capacity. \n\nAmbience: 4/5 - arrived to a line up and was told the wait was going to be 45mins for a party of 2, but ended up waiting 5mins so that was lucky. It's an old place that is jazzed up with Japanese decorations and there is a dj that is set up to play on top of a baby grand piano... haha. So let's say hipster(?). It's full, but manageable noise level. Always feels nice ti eat in a restaurant that others are enjoying as well.", "author": "Monika-Bianca T."}

The good music blasting and the very appetizing food they served was more than enough to convince me to come back.

In the end, I settled with 4 stars, because there is some spectacular food served here that you can't get anywhere else, (i.e. TOFU!!!).\n\nThe Good:\n1. Agedashi tofu: lightly fried, served with just the right toppings\n2. Yakitori: though I thought it was a bit too salty for my tastes, my Japanese friend said the flavor was \"right on\"\n3. Yudofu: some really amazing tofu! Haven't had such good tofu since Eiji or EN in NY\n4. Chawanmushi: looks plain but has great flavors!\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Portions are too small\n2. Prices are a bit high for the quantity (and quality of sushi)\n3. Wasn't too impressed with the sushi. Rolls weren't particularly inventive or tasty, and definitely didn't make up for it in portion size.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1. What self-respecting Japanese restaurant charges $2 hot tea?

Plus, there was music playing in the background that was just loud enough to drown out the conversations from neighboring tables, allowing us to talk without having to scream at each other. That, along with the fairy-lit space, made for a cool vibe. There's also considerable sushi bar seating and a grand piano.\n\nWe enjoyed our orders of dragon roll, flying unagi roll and fried oysters. The waitress was also helpful with sake recommendations and never rushed us despite all the people waiting. \n\nIt's not easy finding above average food options in the Union Square area so I think this is a fun pick, a very short stroll away. Would love to check it out again when they have live piano music playing.", "author": "Nadine D."}

If they've seen you made a mess with the saki bombs, they come running with napkins. \n\nI had about 3-4 appetizers shared with my group of 5 and shared one roll, and uni nigiri pieces.

We got here with a party of 2 around 6:45 pm on a weekend and had to wait about 40 minutes. You write your name down yourself on the clipboard. I didn't think it was all that bad for a popular location on a popular night. Most people crowded around the stairwell area, and that could get stressful, but my date and I opted to get drinks at the Owl Tree across the street while we waited and that worked out perfectly.\n\nThe inside is fairly large for sushi place. It was spacious, but they could seat a lot of people. Compare this to Sakana across the street, which is a lot smaller, and they told us we'd have to wait at least 45 minutes there.\n\nThe service was very nice, though we did have to wait a little long for our food. We got the 49er roll, negihama roll, Tahoe roll, California roll, and Tiger roll. They don't skimp on their portions and the piece were cut quite large. My favorite was the Tahoe roll because I love tuna and the cucumber gave it just the perfect amount of crunch. \n\nIt was also not that pricey for a relatively nice place. The rolls ranged from $9 to $13. Seems like it'd be good for groups, too, because they had enough tables to seat larger parties.

I'm a sucker for stars...multiple stars. Is it sad I base what I eat and do off of the amount of stars a place has?

So instead, we got the beef teriyaki ($14.75) as a starter but it didn't come out until AFTER our rolls were out and we ate them all. So keep mindful of that \"starter\". It's a lot of beef. We had to order a side of steam rice to eat with it.  We had the 49er's sushi roll. Yep...that's right. They had a roll called 49er's and it had crab, avocado with tuna and salmon on top ($13.50). Pretty delicious. We also had the Pokemon sushi roll which had salmon, mango, avocado, and green leaf lettuce, wrapped with soy paper ($11.50). Have to say that this was my favorite. That mango did the trick and I love soy paper wraps over seaweed wraps. We didn't order too much. This was a good amount of food for two people.

We passed by it once bc we didn't notice how dark and hidden the restaurant was in the corner. Depending on what time you go, parking can be hard or easy. We were fortunate to find parking very easily around the vicinity.\n\nOnce you step in, you can't figure out if Ryoko's is a dive bar, restaurant, sushi joint? Which is it?! It does NOT look like your typical sushi restaurant. Nothing inside screams Japanese or sushi. However, the bf and I went in with no judgements ready to start out night and got seated right away.\n\nEven though Ryoko's does not look like your typical Japanese restaurant, the menu looked pretty authentic. They had a variety of sashimi and sushi and we ordered an array of food. \n\nSomething's we ordered:\n-Tofu salad\n-Sweet shrimp\n-Sexy roll\n-Spicy scallop\n-Jumping tuna\n-Soft shell crab\n\nThe sushi here was very clean and fresh. Nothing was overdone with sauce or rice. I really enjoyed eating the Jumping tuna, spicy scallop and sexy roll. All were so simple and clean and most importantly, good fresh fish. The bf always orders a sushi of sweet shrimp and the fried shrimp heads were ginormous and also some of the freshest shrimps he's eaten. \n\nNonetheless, even though our meal was very satisfying, what made our night was the top notch service. The ladies here really made our experience even that much better. They always kept coming by to check on us, refilling my beer from our pitcher to make sure our mug is never empty, and always asking us for anything else.\n\nOverall, I had a great start on my trip here at SF thanks to Ryoko's.

Since I get my fair share of good, traditional sushi and fresh sashimi at home, I was really looking for a sushi bar that does American style sushi well - you know... the fried/baked/cheese covered stuff that on paper seems easy to construct but is actually very difficult to execute well. \n\nRyoko's fit that box perfectly. We had the wakame salad and ankimo (monkfish liver) for starters. The salad leaves and seaweed were fresh and dressed in a slightly sweet orange dressing. None of that sweet ginger dressing crap you find at most Japanese restaurants run by Chinese.  Monkfish liver was new for me and while I thought it was only available in winter, there it was on the menu. It tastes like a cross between a foie gras pate and otoro and comes with ponzu sauce and some grated stuff (ginger or daikon I think). On the scale of seafood delicacies, I probably would have substituted this with uni but that's just personal preference.\n\nWe had the Jumping Unagi, Volcano and Sexy rolls as mains, and the grilled ika because it came rather late in the meal. All three rolls were orgasmic. Just enough of a hodge podge of ingredients to bring out the fish and fatty goodness of avocados or cheese. The Volcano roll has peanut butter in it and I thought, \"wow this really works well\". Kind of strange, unexpected like the jalapeno, but it just works. I thought the Sexy roll could have been baked better because some of the salmon was cold, but it still blew my mind in it's 3/4 done state. \n\nFinally the grilled squid. Oh em gee. In Cantonese we have a term called \"wok hei\" to describe the wok's breath on great stir fried dishes. Here I could taste the grill's...breath (?) on the squid. It was perfect. Not the same as the grilled squid you'd typically get in the Mediterranean, but great Japanese style smoky grilling. Major chopstick fighting til the last ring was consumed.\n\nI had the Ryoko's pilsner while my other half had Asahi. Our server (who's name I unfortunately forgot) was a little flustered because it was a very busy Saturday night but she explained the dishes, recommended a great dessert (I should mention, tempura ice cream is... just order it) and was attentive. Our night was made excellent but the insane trip hop being spun/performed by the DJ. Did not expect it and both of us were contemplating whether to be creepy at the end of our meal and ask for his playlist. \n\nRyoko's has a great combination of the hole-in-the-wall sushi spot experience, with a very energetic yet laid back vibe, great food and very good music. You almost wish there was a dance floor at the back so that you could work off all the fish and rice you're imbibing. We had a truly great evening and it is one for the books.", "author": "Clara L."}

The wait time is super long and you will be forced to wait awkwardly on a flight of stairs, trying not to make eye contact with all the food that is passing by.\n\nThe environment is fun and laid back so it's not a bad place to have a casual dinner with friends. In terms of food though, I don't think there's anything particularly memorable, authentic, or amazing. \n\nTL;DR-Good if you just want to grab sushi with friends. Bad if you are starving upon arrival, be prepared to wait. Keep looking if you are searching for sushi that rivals your study abroad trip to Japan.", "author": "Yanni L."}

The line was huge, Saturday night at 8pm. But I put our name down and then after that the server was getting drinks for everyone waiting at the door. Amazing, by doing that it really made the time go by fast. After about fifteen minutes, we were able to get a table. \n\nThe food was really great, maybe not the Alcatraz. That one was a little less flavorful. But all the rolls after that were amazing! The Jumping California was the best sushi roll I've ever had. Just ridiculous how good it was! \n\nThe one problem and reason why it's not five stars for me. There were a few flies flying around. This is something they need to take care of immediately.

The salmon was so fresh and tender.\n\nMy date got the asahi and I got the sapporo - both on draft and both $4.50.\n\nService was good and although the wait was a little over 30 minutes, I definitely intend on coming back!", "author": "Junel S."}

I came right at opening time, 6pm, on a Friday night, and there was already a very long line waiting to be seated; it was clear the place was a local favorite. I sat at the bar, and both the chefs and servers were incredibly nice, checking on me to make sure everything was to my liking.

After many laborious hours of cafe-ing, Jason C. and I were ready for some late night sushi. When our waiter informed us they were out of uni for the night, our hearts shattered into a million pieces. My mouth had been dying to fornicate with soft, sweet sea urchin, and the unfortunate news kicked my tastebuds into blueballs-mode. The restaurant had run out of many other items on their menu as well; whatever Jason wanted to order, they did not have. What a tease! Ryoko's can have their fourth star when they clean up their act and keep ingredients in stock.\n\nHere's the breakdown of what actually did end up on our table:\n\nEdamame - One of the beans popped out of a pod I was holding and hit the sandal-adorned foot of the woman at the table next to us. Drunk bish didn't even flinch.\n\nChicken Kara-age - Crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside. Perfection!\n\nAnkimo - My first time trying this - crumbly-soft and delicious\n\nToro - Normally my favorite but the slices lacked freshness\n\nSake - Standard, but again, could have been fresher\n\nIkura - Had a strange soapy flavor\n\nIsaki - Yum!\n\nPokemon Roll - Strange combo of mango and salmon wrapped in a mystery yellow skin that tasted surprisingly edible and refreshing\n\nScallop Roll - Why did they have to ruin a perfectly good roll it by tucking in mint leaves?\n\nFried Ice Cream - Shell could have been crispier, but novel and a yummy way to end the meal\n\nYou won't find the best sushi in San Francisco here, but the menu is huge with plenty of creative concoctions. The ambience is energetic with loud upbeat music playing in the stuffy dungeon-like space. Heck, it's like a rave up in here; why isn't there an MDMA roll on the menu? \n\nThis is where I'll be getting my grub on when I'm craving sushi at 1 AM.

One of the rolls, I think it was the volcano roll, was SUPER SPICY .. but it might have been our low spice-tolerance. It comes with its own dipping sauce, which was interesting and pretty good.\n\nService was spotty, hard to get someone's attention because they are extremely busy.

Ridiculously fresh for being so late on a Friday night (like around 10ish). The Sexy roll came with a yummy dipping sauce I don't know what it was but it was sweet and tangy in my opinion and definitely PERFECT for the roll! The Jumping California has cheese, which I've never tried in a sushi roll but it was BOMB!

I have never had a bad experience here.  Wait time can be daunting at peak hours, but the experience can be enjoyed with a drink from the bar on the stairs meeting new friends.\n\nSushi selections here are fairly wide ranging from the typical kitschy roll combos like the volcano roll with peanut butter to the more traditional fare of nigiri and sashimi offerings which are all fresh and flavorful.  I recommend the omakase offerings to allow your chef's choice which I have never been disappointed with. \n\nYou gotta love a sushi place in the heart of San Francisco in a basement, on the outskirts of the Tenderloin with a DJ playing music.

I went here because of the four stars on Yelp and because it's a block away from the JW Marriot I'm in at the moment.  How could I miss?  Easily!  Considering the location on the north edge of the tenderloin, the prices seem a little high.  The music is way too loud, and between the manager and the waitress relentlessly asking if I wanted to order anything else and refilling my glass from my Asahi bottle, it really seemed rushed and as if it was all about turning the table.  The food?  The nigiri was good and decent size but the roll was pretty small.  I ended up ordering chicken teriyaki after all that because I was still hungry.  The cut up fish behind the glass waiting to become somebody's dinner looked like it had been there long enough to have already have made a first try at being somebody's lunch.\n\nJust like Captain Picard in \"Chain of Command\" ... \"THERE ARE THREE LIGHTS\" ... the fixtures over the sushi bar made it feel like an interrogation was about to commence.

About a 10 min walk if you parked in the garage at the Macy's lot. Came here with a party of 4 around 615 and we were seated right away. It's advisable to come here for an early or late dinner. Anywhere from 7pm-830pm gets really crowded and there is a long wait, so plan accordingly.\n\nIt has a pretty cool 'underground' feel to it. Seating-wise, it is not too cramped. Here's what was ordered:\n\n----------------------------\n\nAppetizer:\n\nDeep Fried Oysters - it has the mushy, gushy taste. You can definitely taste the chunks of oyster. It was a bit over-fried for me. Comes with 4 pieces. I don't recommend this\n\nSaba Shioyaki - the mackerel was grilled to perfection. The skin had a light crispiness. This was very very tasty.\n\nRolls:\n\nHot Tuna + Hot Tail - had the same ingredients with the exception of the fish. There was a nice little spiciness to it and a bit of a mint flavor which was actually refreshing. Pretty good, but this wasn't the best thing I've ever had.\n\nNigiri:\n\nHamachi - generous piece of hamachi. Buttery, melts in your mouth. Fresh. This was freaking good.\n\nHalibut - I typically don't eat halibut, but this was pretty good too. Light taste.\n\nTuna - tuna is tuna. Don't really care about it.\n\nUnagi - pretty saucy. Not bad, but I've had better.\n\nTako - perfect firmness, not crunchy. Big pieces of tako!\n\nThe rice was a little warm which was a plus. It didn't crumble and held itself together pretty well with the fish.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nOverall, this place is pretty good. I recommend getting the hamachi, tako, and saba shioyaki. Service was impeccable. Constantly refilled waters and took away plates as needed. I didn't have to ask or anything.

If you have jisa boke = time difference and get hungry in the middle of the night, well, don't worry, they are open to late. I recommend sushi diners from beginners to advanced. They can entertain you at any level; all the way to Omakase.\n\nHistory: The founder of Ryoko's Japanese Restaurant & Bar has an extensive background in traditional Japanese hospitality and night club level customer service. Yes, her name is Ryoko. I have invited high quality Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese, European, Russian, Middle Eastern business affilation here a day before I close a business deal. Ryoko Mama was always there to give the dinner and drinking experience an elegant magical touch. Ryoko Mama believes in prosperity, family wellness and universal sustainable peace. Her children that also help her business have been raised here in USA with Japanese hardcore tradition and ethics. This family believes in family and community bonding, harmony, resilience and unconditional compassion. When any employee had a chance to work here for a period of time, they were all exposed to these values through this family one way or another. Ryoko Mama has been open to serve and employ a vast diverse population that seek excellence. At one point, there was an Itacho, Senior Sushi Chef who was a piano player. That is why there is a beautiful piano there today. The reason why they have live DJs is from that kokorokubari and kikubari of making sure that your dining experience is full. Yah, Dubstep and Sushi. \n\nNeta = Sushi materials. Abundant and extremely fresh. Ryoko's Japanese Restaurant & Bar has a high service rotation cycle. Which means they have to keep supplying fresh batches of neta all the time.  \n\nServing of Sushi. Generous portions and clean traditional cuts. Ryoko's Japanese Restaurant & Bar's chefs are trained from a clear lineage of Japanese itamae. Their fish meat are cut thick, clean and in proper angle with a very well sharpened sashimi traditional knife. The surface of the cut fish or shellfish is shiny and slippery. That is why the best of the fragrance and texture is guranteed. Cutting the fishes and clams is not belittled here. You can try their Akami (the deep red part of the maguro = tuna) and you will see how it feels.\n\nAtmpsphere. Uplifting, good vibe, energy flowing, healthy, upbeat, fusion culture, diverse diners, young and not too young are all there, highly addictive atmosphere... I think. It makes you want to go there again and again. The biggest element of sushi is not the food. It is your interaction with the chefs. They are meant to be Iki ga ii. Lively and good luck. Well, you got the real thing here. Ah, fire your therapist and dine here 5 days in a row. You will pop out of any gloominess!\n\nTrue Meanging of Sushi. Sushi stands were once found all over the busy parts of cities and towns where people that were not properly clothed or washed could just drop by and grab, then get back to work. It was meant to be Iki-ga-ii = very lively. Nijo bukai = deeply compassionate and down to earth. So, the root to sushi was a common food, very much like hotdog stands here in USA. As the price of seafood went up, sushi became a posh luxury food as it got integrated with kaiseki. Ryoko's Japanese Restaurant and Bar has kept its original meaning of sushi. \n\nI will upload some photos. Ask me any questions :)", "author": "Yuki T."}

I ordered the special, Monkfish Liver sashimi, it was oh so good.. The foie gras of the sea is the best way to describe it, super fresh, no mineral flavours, buttery and firm at the same time and you can \"taste the sea\" in it as the birthday boy of the table described it... Instead of the giant clam nigiri, we opted for the white tuna (waitress recommended).. it was the best sushi of the night, hands down.. The white tuna was buttery, soft and delicious with a thin slice of lemon and a spicy dollop of ginger something on top! Wow, this one blew me away. A little taste of sushi heaven..The rice on all the sushi and rolls was done perfectly and served at room temperature.\n\nI was so happy that we had a wonderful waitress!

By \"all\" I mean from about noon until midnight, nonstop, yet somehow when I got back to the Loin I had energy to snag some grub and one more drink to cap the evening. That's when the home girl Ting's message popped into my head, \"Ryoko is open until 2am every single day...\" Hmmm, a little sushi and hot sake really would be a perfect end to a perfect day.\n\nSo off I went, strolling my way through the Tenderloin on this fine Saturday night.\n\nUpon arrival I got a good vibe, chill place to hang out late night no doubt. It's below street level, so I rolled down the stairs right into that good NWA which was quickly followed by some 2Pac and Ice Cube, basically all kinds of 90s gangster rap. So good. Sure sometimes it's nice to have a traditional Japanese spot with relaxing music and proper staff, but not in the Tenderloin and not at 1:00AM on a Saturday.\n\nThe food was decent, I would not go out of my way to roll through here just to grub at a normal dinner hour. Late night though? Can't beat it. I'd say Sudachi (another later night sushi spot maybe 6 blocks away) has higher quality food but they have different hours and I've been caught in fist fights twice now outside there so I figure that's an omen to try someplace new. The service was very good at Ryoko, the sushi chefs a bit quiet but my waitress was very helpful. I ordered some sort of cucumber salad with \"miso\" and it came out in some mayo type sauce. I explained the mix-up, I don't do mayo, and she apologized profusely and took it away no problem. No pushback what so ever, she even said she'd put in a note to have the description changed as she agreed it could be misleading.\n\nI downed my sake and light selection of sushi with another veggie salad and that was that.

Ryoko's, unfortunately did meet my expectations. The only thing that somewhat impressed me was the DJ that was spinning on the late Friday evening that I was dining there. Gotta love Kaskade! :P\n\nAnyway, the atmosphere was inviting and hip. The food was not as inviting and hip. The salmon in the onigiri I ordered, was cooked, as oppose to it being pickled/dried like in Japan. Not my preference and didn't translate well for me.\n\nThe ama ebi (sweet shrimp) was something I was looking forward to but left a somewhat unpleasant taste in my mouth. What was suppose to be a succulent, sweet tasting shrimp tasted unfresh and not as sweet to me. The tuna and the yellowtail were the best pieces of the evening, with yellowtail being the absolute best. The flesh was firm and fresh tasting. \n\nI appreciate that we received complimentary soy beans but it really could not make up for the quality of the food or the overly hyped expectations. *sigh* I think I just slipped into a tourist trap by dining here.

The least enjoyable thing about their sushi is their sushi rice. Everytime I've had their sushi (dine-in or takeout), their sushi rice was under-flavored and hard and dry. \n\nThe most enjoyable piece of sushi I had there was probably the ama-ebi nigiri. The shrimp was very fresh and sweet...crunchy but also melts in your mouth. I've tried several of their sushi rolls but they were...meh. Since it's mostly rice and the rice is no good...go figure. They do advertise using fresh, organic ingredients so maybe it's just the sushi rice that needs some extra work. :/ \n\nMy boyfriend always order their steamed clams in sake. Sometimes it's pretty good. A simple, enjoyable dish when the flavors are well-balanced. Sometimes, it's like taking shots.\n\nThis place has the ambiance of a bar/lounge. Dimly lit. Loud club-type music. I think they have live DJs sometimes, maybe the weekend. It's especially crowded during the weekend. You're practically rubbing elbows and butt cheeks with the people around you. But you don't have to worry about others overhearing your conversation. The music is so loud you probably can't even hear yourself think. Surprisingly everyone else seems to be able to carry on a very nice conversation with their friends/dates.\n\nThe service is pretty good here aside from their enthusiastic hello and goodbye when you come in or leave. The waitresses are all young and bubbly.\n\nI would recommend this place if you want late-night sushi and not too particular about your sushi. Or if you want sushi for bar food. This wouldn't be one of those places where I'd take my out-of-town guests for the meal of their life or out-of-this-world experience.

I'm not really sure why people are clamoring to eat here?  The sashimi was good, but it was a relatively small portion for the price. The rest of food, including the miso soup and teriyaki sauce, was sub par.  The seating can be a bit cramped and the noise level is relatively high so not the best date night place, more of a place to go with your buddy if you live in the neighborhood and you don't want to drive somewhere better.  I would also consider the service average.", "author": "Ken T."}

However, each and every time, i have been utterly disappointed. \n\nThis place is the epitome of a modern trendy japanese restaurant that relies on the hype of being hip and fun. The clientele here are mostly young trendy americans who are here to drink and socialize rather than to enjoy the quality or originality of the food. Don't get me wrong, i love trendy sushi joints like this, that are great for birthday parties, a girl's night out, and a natural starting point to a fun-filled night of drunken shenanigans... only when it's done right.  \n\nMy most recent experience at Ryoko prompts me to not give this place anymore second, third, or fourth chances. \n\n** SERVICE\nThe host was rude and the server kept rushing us. Understandably, we had a pretty large party of 12, and I'm assuming they only have a few areas that can fit large parties. Another large party's reservation was probably coming up, so they wanted to free the table. However, there are better ways of hurrying up your patrons than coming up every 15 minutes and counting down the time we have left at our table. Talk about stressing a party out. We were celebrating a birthday and their impatience really dampened the birthday girl's experience. \n\n** AMBIANCE\nI knew this place is usually loud but even reservations for the semi-private room could not provide a moment of quiet to hear the companion sitting next to me, due to the constant blast of loud music and drunk chatting from other patrons. \n\n** THE FOOD\nThe rolls were unimaginative and mediocre, at best, for a place that does not rely on freshness or quality of the fish. I also ordered many hot appetizers as to avoid ordering too many rolls and sushi. However, the yakitori was inexcusably overcooked and dry, the gyoza was bland, and the chicken karaage was average and sadly, the best dish of the night. \n\nI've been to modern japanese restaurants where patrons frequent for the fun and up-beat ambiance, alcoholic drinks, and late-night sushi - and it worked (check out The Eatery in Vancouver), but unfortunately, Ryoko is not one of them. \n\nI don't understand what all the hype is about..", "author": "Lily S."}

Based on the rolls that I had, it didn't distinguish itself from any other sushi place. The quality of the fish is good (especially the salmon) and the rolls were delicious but nothing special. I'm giving this place three stars mainly because everything here is overpriced. I was especially upset about how overpriced ochazuke was here. They were charging $6.50 for ochazuke, which was baffling to me because it's only rice in green tea with toppings and pickled vegetables. It is a very simple food that involves hardly any cooking and costs almost nothing. I felt like Ryoko's was taking advantage of customers who don't know the real cost of Japanese cuisine.

Yelp reviews were good, so we had dinner prior to the show.  Got there just before 6:00pm so there was no wait for a table.  The space reminded me of the underground restaurants you find in New York and Boston which is cool, however it does get quite warm in the restaurant.  First thought when looking at the menu was that they do not use real crab.  Half the rolls use the fake crab.  In my mind that immediately put them in the lower tier of sushi restaurants.  We tried chicken karaage (best dish), Ochazuke with salmon (not bad), Toro, Sake and Hamachi nigiri (Meh-bland taste), Jumping Unagi roll (OK), and Spicy Scallop roll (not spicy, pretty slimey). With tax and tip, bill came in at about $35/person.  By the time we left, there was a line up the steps.  I personally would not go back because there was nothing outstanding on the menu besides the chicken karaage, and there are so many more sushi places to try.", "author": "Kevin Y."}

I hadn't had a good sushi fix in awhile and was so excited. Ryoko's really is one of the TOP sushi destinations in the Bay Area. It's always fresh, they have a wonderful array of different rolls in addition to the standard fare, and the whole atmosphere takes me back to my days in Tokyo. I would say it's a pretty authentic experience all around, with the exception of the massive selection of maki.\n\nSo anyway, we walk in on a Tuesday night around 10pm, put our names on the list. As we are waiting, we are suddenly assaulted by the music playing on the house sound system. Not only was it WAY too loud for an eating establishment, but it was DUB STEP. I look around and see that there's a DJ sitting at the piano standing behind a couple of CD-J's, but playing music from an iPod. I immediately wanted to strangle him, but instead I ordered some Saki and pounded it, hoping to drum up enough of a buzz to stop caring that my much-anticipated sushi-gasm is about to be ruined by the worst music ever to be created by mankind.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of cracking death-to-the-DJ jokes and wincing at the increasingly bad musical choices coming up in the background, we were finally seated at the bar. More Sake please. STAT. As we made our way through our dining experience, nearly having to yell at each other over the poop-fest invading our ear drums, this DJ decides to throw on some TRAP. As if Dub Step wasn't the most inappropriate choice of music to accompany one's meal, Trap is probably the second most inappropriate. What, am I suddenly going to hop up in the middle of my meal to start popping and locking to this guy's crappy set? Not like he was actually doing any mixing with that ipod action, so I'm not sure he deserves to use the term DJ.\n\nAs far as the food, everything we had was great. The American roll is an adventure in fusion - it's a kind of roll topped with baked salmon and american cheese. It kind of tastes like someone put velveeta all over my California Roll, but I can't necessarily say it was bad. Just weird.\n\nAlso, the takoyaki was just okay. Back in Japan, I remember it having small bits of squid in the center of a golf-ball-sized fluffy dough ball, but at Ryoko's it was more like a large chunk coated in 1/4 inch of batter, shaped like a sphere. Definitely more chewy than fluffy. The sauce and mayo just weren't quite the same either.\n\nThis may very well be my last trip to Ryoko's without a large group to distract me from the awful background music.

The rolls seemed on the smaller side, but nevertheless they were good.\nI attended a birthday party here and we sat at one of the large group tables in the back. 2 of the seats at the table were broken. We discovered that one of them was broken before anyone got hurt, but our waiter found out the hard way that another was broken and nearly fell over when it broke. It was a pretty embarrassing scenario, and having broken furniture for guests to sit down on is rather irresponsible. They were obviously moments from falling apart if someone stopped to take a look.\n\nI also thought it was unfortunate that the route to their tiny upstairs restroom was such a pain. Everyone's tables are so close together that you pretty much can't help but bump into people or have them scoot in to get buy. I imagine it would be a real annoyance to be seated in that area.\n\nAs I said, solid sushi, but I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to return.", "author": "Katie S."}

You walk down the stairs to the restaurant below street level and everybody shouts a greeting. The lighting is dim and it feels very cozy. We sat down and were helped out quickly. We ordered a Moro-Q (cucumber with miso sauce) appetizer, the Sashimi Dinner, and a Pokemon Roll. The Moro-Q was okay, tasty, but the miso sauce was not my favorite kind of flavor. The Pokemon Roll was also just okay, the flavor is very light and rice-y. The sashimi however was good, and noticeably fresh. We also ordered a glass of wine and a small bottle of Sake. We were in a bit of a rush to make a show time, so we probably didn't have a chance to enjoy it as much as we could have, but it was a good dinner.

No specialty cocktail menu, but it's a nice alternative to sake and rice wine.\n- Live DJ. Unlike Mas Sake, the music here isn't conversation stopping loud. Perfect volume and a nice background soundtrack  for sushi. \n- Cozy, comfortable, and cool. The restaurant's secluded spot underground creates a sexy, secretive atmosphere. Tables are close, but not claustrophobic and even on a busy night the space doesn't seem too crowded. \n- Fast and Friendly service. \n- LATE night hours! \n\nAnd only a few minuses:\n- Dragon Roll. I'm usually a big fan, but their deep fried version of this specialty roll is disappointingly awful. \n- No reservations for the same day - call a day ahead if you need to secure a spot. \n\nRyoko's is a gem of a restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-11", "description": "This place started out a four star for three reasons: 1) freshness of sashimi and 2) generous portions of fish in the rolls and 3) they are one of very few sushi places that have a spicy tuna roll that uses whole chunks of tuna marinated in chili sauce (much better textural experience). \n\nI downgraded the place for  three key reasons.  1) the service was slow as they are terribly understaffed.  I think there was one waitress working the whole place with one helper and no host(ess). As a result, you waited for the food and waited even longer for the table.  2) the place is loud.  Not sure why they blast the house music because the place is small.  People have to talk over the music which makes for more noise.  Hard to enjoy conversation and the meal.  3) the dessert missed badly.  They had a wasabi mochi but there was no wasabi flavor.  it was seasame but the waitress insisted that it was wasabi.  Weird.  and the Fried ice cream had almost no ice cream.  it was like they melted the ice cream away and tried to back fill it with spray whipped cream.  Very poor execution.\n\nI didnt take down points for the decor, but it is worth calling out.  Bad Bad Bad.  Dont mind that it is eclectic and a bit gritty, but the walls were painted a rich blue. Love the color but not for a restaurant.  There is not naturally occurring food that is blue, so the mind actually can register a drop in appetite when there lots of blue in a dining environment.  Personally I do find it less appetizing when food is presented in blue light or in a heavily painted blue room.  Not to all restaurants---go with a different color.  \n\nI have had better sushi (especially for the prices they charge) and it really isnt worth the wait or dealing with parking in this area.  If you are around and want sushi, its OK, but not a standout.", "author": "Scott C."}

I usually order nigiri that's caught that day or been \"flown\" in that day from Japan and it never ceases to amaze me. Their special rolls are decent as well.. My favorite by far is the 49ers roll.\n\nThe vibe is sceney and the music is usually electronica/dance-ish. Often times they bring in a DJ who sets up on top of the baby grand piano. He never plays that loud though. \n\nRyoko's would have received a full 5 star rating, but they don't take reservations and if you don't get there early enough (before 715pm) you should expect to wait at least 20 minutes and sometimes up to an hour and a half. It's worth it though - they take drink orders while you wait for seats so it makes the standing/waiting a little more bearable. \n\nSometimes the service is questionable, especially if they seat you near one of those pillars that hides you from their view.

The give you drinks of your choice while you wait!!!! The wait staff is so nice I love it!!!!! Much bigger then you originally think. Also thy stay open LATE! BUT! what we had we def enjoyed!\n\nThe BAD:\nWell the wait was forever!!! If you go make a reservation or be there a bit early (we went pretty late saturday night). Not as big as I would like...kind of compacted. I didn't go but I think there is only one bathroom in there!

Although I had a really good time, I know that much of this was because my parents are just really cool and we were all in a good mood. So therefore I will try to separate this positive bias from the characteristics of the food and restaurant. \n\nFirst, we waited a long time to even be acknowledged when we first descended the stairs to the restaurant, so one star there. The place wasn't super crowded, but the hostess just seemed frazzled. She took us to a back area that my parents looked uncomfortable in due to the really low tables and chairs. It was like Alice in Wonderland and we suddenly all grew oversized. \n\nThe hostess sensed our discomfort and offered to move us to a booth, but it was awkwardly placed next to an empty 4-person table that remained empty for most of the meal. It was a Wednesday night and they didn't have too many people pouring in...I think they could have given that larger table up for us. But whatever, like I said - we were in a good mood. \n\nMy dad, the real estate broker, kept raving about how rare it is for a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco to have a full liquor license. All that means to me is  - shots and sushi together?? Awesome. \n\nIn terms of ambience, the space looks like it was definitely a divey bar at some point and not much has been done to change it into a sushi-feeling place. But that makes it actually much more unique. \n\nWe tried the jumping tuna roll thanks to a former Yelp review and really enjoyed it. Actually, all of the rolls we tried were yummy, but the tonkatsu appetizer was waaay dry. \n\nWe were happy and full leaving the restaurant, but later my mom ended up ordering a huge plate of garlic fries and my dad scarfed an apple pie at Lori's.

Definitely within walking distance if you are shopping in the area and need a sushi fix. \n\nWe ordered:\n14 piece sashimi dinner that comes with a miso soup: The quality of fish was above average and each piece of fish had a different zest/flavor (lemon, ginger, spicy radish sauce...). The zest broke up what can be a monotonous dish (fish, fish, and more fish). The miso soup was good too - (it's miso soup so the quality cap is low) - but still no complaints. \n\nSpicy tuna roll was delicious - they put shiso (a type of mint-ish herb) in it, which gave the roll a unique kick at the end. \n\nWe shared the Jumping Tuna roll as an appetizer - it was incredibly unique, delicious, and came with a sweet spicy sauce to dip the fried roll in. \n\nThe seaweed salad was small for the price ($5) - but tasted good. \n\nWe ordered a large hot sake followed by a small hot sake and green tea. Sake was good, but expensive for the quality. Tea was a little watered down for my taste but the refills kept coming which was great. \n\nWhy this review didn't get 5 stars: 1) menu seemed poorly organized, lots of options, hard to wrap your head around what to order; 2) service was spotty - our sushi took 6 seconds to come out, the second sake took 3 yrs; 3) there was no apparent drink menu; they do have a full bar, but if we weren't seated directly in front of the bar we would've had no idea. \n\nIf yelp allowed it, Ryoko's would get 4.5 stars -- the ambiance was warm and welcoming and the food delicious.

This was NOT the case tonight! On top of the waitress being extremely rude, our drinks and meal were beyond terrible. I ordered a martini and my friend ordered the lemon drop. They gave me a short glass of warm vodka as a martini and my friend got a short glass with a little bit of sugar sprinkled on the rim with what tasted like instant lemonade in her drink. When we asked if we could just send them back and order a glass of wine, the waitress said since we already ordered she couldn't take it off the bill. We decided to just drink water after that. We then ordered 2 rolls and some pieces of nigiri. The salmon, which the waitress decided to just add to our plate turned out to be $18. It was also the worst piece on the plate. Another one of the pieces, which was supposed to be halibut had some sort of weird bone in it. Our total for the meal came to $95 for bad sushi and drinks we didn't even drink. By far the worst meal I have ever had with the least accommodating and rudest service. I will not be coming back and would never again recommend this place to friend.", "author": "Maryn C."}

It's a very small, cozy place with solid sushi. The atmosphere is good. The service was efficient and our waitress was friendly. \n\nThey serve you some edamame to start. We had the Pokemon roll, the Volcano Roll, and the Jumping Eel Roll. Everything was very fresh. I loved the Pokemon and the Jumping Eel Roll. I bit in and the fresh fish almost melted in my mouth. They use high quality fish (as they should). \n\nThe Volcano roll was okay but it was a little strange. We ordered it because it had peanut butter in it and sounded interesting. I think peanut butter is best left off sushi. It wasn't terrible but picture a shrimp with a glob of peanut butter on it and you'll get the picture. I wouldn't order the Volcano Roll again. \n\nI also had a good miso soup and the Karaage Chicken (fried chicken). Both were excellent. The Karaage Chicken was just as Japanese fried chicken should be, lightly crispy with a tasty satisfying little crunch. \n\nI do like this hole in the wall and will be here again soon for sure. There was a line so make sure you you get there in advance to put your name down.", "author": "Jacqueline C."}

We joined them and their parents for a dinner one one of our first nights in town to see if their hype was justified.\n\nWe ordered a selection of our favorite items to see how they stacked up to our favorite sushi house back home plus a couple of different items. The gyoza and edamame were a good standard start to the meal and from there we moved on to a standout. The whole grilled squid was quite the eye opener. Chewy but not in a bad way it was really fresh and the grilled flavor matched up perfect with the squid. It was easily the best squid I'd ever had at a sushi place. Now that we got warmed up and had our expectations raised we moved on to the sushi.\n\nWe ordered our standbys BBQ eel with avocado and a spicy tuna roll along with a couple pieces of toro sushi. I'm not sure I've ever had a bad eel avocado roll but this was fresher than most and was damn tasty. The hot tuna as they serve it was one of the best tuna rolls I've had. Unlike most spicy tuna rolls, they used a spicy marinade instead of the standard spicy mayo to kick up the spice level and it really worked well. I wish all spicy tuna rolls used this technique! The toro pieces were fall apart tender and super rich and flavorful. I've only had it a few times but this was definitely my favorite. Clean and fatty and just fantastic fish.\n\nHighly recommended and my friends were completely right that it was way above all of the sushi in our area. FISH!", "author": "Chris L."}

Turns out it has been there for 26 years and people line up nightly to try and squeeze into this tiny spot. I was fortunate to be a party of one and easily get a table right away at the bar. I happened to sit next to the owner of the place who was fastidious in managing all components from her perch. All night she kept an eye on every order, drink, appetizer left unattended or not meeting immediate delivery. The fish I found out is shipped from Japan daily and the owner having been there so long is one of the first ones to get her pick, which explains their exceptional Tuna Yukke. The chefs and staff are very friendly, the atmosphere is a dive bar meets hole in the wall restaurant. The cuts are great. I stuck to sashimi for the most part hirame, ikura, uni, unagi, sake, tako, hamachi but did enjoy the spicy scallop and the Alaskan A's. The owner knows Jiro and regularly goes back to Japan to visit Jiro. She maintains a high standard which is why this place has survived a quarter century in a high turnover industry. \n\nIf you are in downtown SF, Ryokos is a must stop.", "author": "Bharat W."}

We arrived at the wrong time which was when the all the tables were just filled and there were 4 of us. If we were just 2 we could've sat down way earlier. We waited at least an hour which is never my policy to wait more than 30 min. However, my husband found this highly rated place on Yelp and we were visiting SF and did not have a plan B. We were the first party to write our names down. If you dine here, know that if you have to wait for a table YOU have to write your name down yourself and don't stray too far away from the front of the line or else you will not hear your name being called and they will call the next party on the list. I witnessed they sat people down who were later down the list first because the waitress had so much to do. As for the sushi, my husband said its the best sushi he has ever had but you have to know that he is not much of a sushi aficionado. Me, on the other hand (worked in a Japanese restaurant owned by Japanese sushi chef) thought the fish was very fresh but was very skimpy. I do have to say their wasabi was the real deal. Being the place was so busy, the service was very slow. We didn't get a refill of water, didn't see our waitress way long after we finished our meal. There was still a long line out the door after we left and believe me we were ready to leave long before we got our check. I wanted to go get sushi one more time before leaving SF but would not go back here. Not that memorable to wait an hour for a table.", "author": "Debby S."}

Seems like a lot of people complain about the long waits - they do take reservations, FYI. But it is hard if you come on a whim since reservations have to be made 24 hours and advance. But if you have a reservation, you will get in easy peasy. (we were even 40 minutes late to our res... oops)\n\nI suggested Ryoko's since I wanted to dine somewhere fun since it was a group dinner. Ryoko's definitely has a fun environment along with great food - it made it even more fun with the live DJ spinning Friday night.\n\nThis time around, we ordered a variety of appetizers, rolls, and rounds of hot sake and beer. I tried their Chicken Karaage, Hot Tail Roll, Dragon Roll, Sexy Roll, Jumping Tuna Roll, and one of the specials of the day - White Tuna Belly Sashimi. Chicken Karaage was delicious and all of the rolls were so fresh/melt in your mouth.

Problem was, my main course came out before the appetizer. I ordered the sashimi plate. It came out less than 5 minutes from the time we placed our order. This is only possible if the fish is already sliced. That's a no no in Japanese cuisine. And usually sashimi is sliced thicker than Nigiri, but it wasnt. Different fish were touching each other which is also not the right plating; I don't need salmon oils on my tuna. I was not happy with this plate.

Though he didn't even ask for my name or anything, I just told him that I had a reservation for a set time?\n- Sushi/food is definitely delish.\n\nWhy this place is getting 2 stars and not 5:\n- Tiny portions! At the rate of how slow we were receiving our food (more info about their service below), we didn't want to order more.\n- Slowww and, \"meh\" service. It's also why we skipped out on dessert. I REALLY wanted to try their tempura ice cream! :( Our server was also... well, long story short: he was a noob (but! he was very nice). \n\nWe sat looking at the menus for about 10 minutes before we were even greeted by our server. On top of that, we had all asked for waters which took another 5 minutes and then finally, our complimentary edamame came out. We had told our server we weren't ready to order yet so he said he'd come back. Waited another 15 minutes for him to come back. \n\nHe was helping our table, and 2 others, one to the right and one to the left of us. He kept getting the orders mixed up for which plate is to which table. He had approached my table twice with a plate that we didn't order. We drank our water pretty fast because of the long wait and I had to grab his attention to refill all 4 of our cups. Eventually a second person came by to refill our cups again later because it seemed he may had forgotten to check our water the 2nd time. He seemed pretty overwhelmed. :/ The girls next to us were also complaining because the server had forgotten a plate they ordered and why their food taking so long.\n\nOur food (total of 4 people at the table) all came out at random times... it was weird. This was basically how it happened:\n(15 minutes later after telling the server our order)\n1x salad arrives for person #1 *10 minutes later* \n1x sashimi plate arrives for person #2 *5 minutes later* \n1x sushi plate arrives for person #2 *5 minutes later* \n1x sushi & sashimi arrives for person #3 *5 minutes later* \n1x sushi order comes out for person #4 *10 minutes later* \n1x tonkatsu plate arrives for person #1 *5 minutes later* \n1x tonkatsu plate arrives for person #4\n\nWe stayed there for a 1hr and 40'ish minutes, mainly because we were waiting for all our food to arrive and not because we wanted to stay longer. I'll probably give this place another shot though, to see if maybe it was just a bad night tonight.", "author": "Sydney M."}

No exaggeration. We ordered the Volcano roll ($13) expecting something amazing but to our great disappointment it looked and tasted like something we could make at home.

I first came here for a friends birthday, and had never heard of the place before.  Our group was large, and they did their best to keep us all close together.  It is a small space, so we were situated in two adjacent \"rooms\".  It worked out really well, and the wait staff was amazing for a full restaurant, and our 20+ person party.  The next couple of times, I've gone in, the service has still been amazing, and very friendly... and quick!   Consistency is key!  \n\nNow, regarding the food - the rolls are good, and not very expensive.  I eat a lot of sushi rolls, and they pretty much have the standard.  No one particular roll stood out from the others.  The sashimi is typically sized, nothing overtly generous, but they don't skimp either.  Overall the food, isn't \"to die for\" as I usually like to rate fabulous food, but it is very very satisfying.   And the food is definitely worth the wait.  Their sake selection is good too!  I'm not a big fan of sake, but my friend (from Japan) chose one that was 2nd to the best I've ever had (the best I've had was at Sebo, but probably cost triple what it cost here).\n\nSo, if you plan on going to Ryoko's be prepared to wait (they do take your order for a drink while you wait).

Ive never had this before I love to try new things so I ordered it. This tasted like a delicate tofu smoked IN salmon. The flavor is distinct and gives a powerful punch...I think that the sauce it is served in is some sort of ginger and something else. In any case, it was pretty damn amazing! So much so, I ordered a second helping.\n-Sashimi platter: I was getting quite full so I was only able to try the maguro and salmon on the platter. The fish tasted just as it should and was extremely fresh.\n-Gyoza: The gyoza was not the typical shaped dumpling rather it was nearly pancake flat but delicious nonetheless.\n-Asten Roll: Yummy asparagus and deep fried tempura...I call these little meals in a roll lol\n\nTo top the night off, our service was stellar and the overall vibe was a great end to a lovely evening.

Our server was pretty good but I admittedly don't expect TOO much out of busy spots like this. We ordered the Volcano Roll out of curiosity and the fried California Roll (it might be a different name). Both rolls were great, if a tiny bit small for the price.

Lastly, we decided to try their oysters and had 2 each (they only charge $1.90 per piece) and we were pleasantly surprised at the wonderful taste and size of the oysters.

But....\n\nI have never waited so long for sushi (very mediocre sushi) in my life!  4 nigiris and 1 roll took 25 minutes to fulfill.  Perhaps they had to go fish my sashimi from the ocean (maybe if they did that instead, the food would have been more fresh).  After the TINY portions came, we decided to order another roll, and that took another 20 minutes.  Keep in mind that our table was for 8:30pm, a bit towards the later part of dinnertime.  As if that was not pathetic enough, the bill took another 10 minutes to arrive, and I basically had to take my money to the counter as no waitstaff even bothered to pick up the bill.  \n\nAs for the food, mediocre.  We ordered the Pokemon Roll (Salmon, mango, avocado, cucumber, wrapped in soy paper), Dragon Roll, Sea Urchin, Giant Clam, Ebi, and Tako.  The Pokemon Roll tasted alright, but the Eel in the Dragon Roll did not taste fresh at all.  The giant clam nigiri was so fishy that even the wasabi could not drown out the taste.   The rest of the nigiris were okay, but nothing jumps out.\n\nAdditionally, Yelp was right in that it resembled more of a dive-bar then a restaurant.

It seems tiny when you walk in, but it's bigger than it looks. On a Sunday night at around 9:00, we waited about 15 minutes for a party of four. According to their menu, they use 100% organic veggies, which I love. The House Salad (mixed greens with shredded carrots, cucumber, and tomato and a sesame dressing) was tasty. They use shiso in a lot of their rolls, which is an unusual flavor that I really enjoyed. The Hot Tail Roll (marinated yellowtail in a supposedly spicy sauce, with shiso, and cucumber) was good, but certainly not spicy. The Volcano Roll (tempura shrimp, jalapeno, peanut butter, cucumber, and flying fish roe) was quite enjoyable. it didn't scream peanut butter, but it definitely added a nice flavor you don't normally get in a sushi roll! I had the soju with lemon soda to drink. It was incredibly dry....tasted like a vodka soda with a bit of lemon. I'll probably try the soju with Calpico next time.", "author": "Dara M."}

There was no one at the host stand, but we gradually realized there's a self-manned sign-up sheet for a table. With a few names in front of us, we had around a 30-minute wait ahead, which would have been easier if there was space to stand (or, hell, sit!) without being in the way of coming-and-going customers.\n\nThe first thing to open was a bar seat, and we took it. We were on the very end, and seemed to get a little forgotten because of this. The folks behind the bar did not handle orders, but a separate girl who had a table section on the floor. We ordered three rolls to share and commenced waiting anew. When the sushi finally arrived, we enjoyed most of it -- but frankly, I'm not sure it was any better than sushi places back home (which also often have the bonus of BOGO or 50% off specials). The rolls were on the small side; and my water glass seemed to always be empty. The quirks of a loud, crowded space; the unfortunate bar seating; and fairly inattentive staff added up to a mediocre experience for me.", "author": "Christina G."}

Unfortunately, the manager wasn't in that day.\n\nWithin the hour, the manager, Reiko Kobayashi, called me to discuss what transpired.  I inquired whether or not the restaurant had cameras (unfortunately, they don't) and whether or not there were any leads or if there was anything further that could be done.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the end of the case as the police just stopped by here after taking a report and asked if they had cameras as well, and that was the only interrogation on the part of the SFPD.\n\nThe SFPD on the other hand, were also pretty hostile when I tried to inquire about the report the following day.  I spoke with someone who identified himself as an \"Officer Wonder,\" who didn't know anything about my particular case, but presumed that I was asking for \"the SWAT\" team to go out and find my telephone which was rude, defensive and not at all what I was looking for.  I explained to him that I wasn't familiar with such processes after filing a police report and was only merely looking to gather more information.\n\nNeedless to say, the reason I was so persistent in trying to retrieve my telephone, apart from the cost of it, was that there were some photos I wanted to upload to my computer, among them some from my birthday with my aunt that were very special to me.  Those, unfortunately, are gone forever.\n\nOn a separate and partially related note, there are concerns that cell phones in your pocket can lower your sperm count.

I really can't go to any other sushi restaurants anymore, even the places that I used to frequent that had \"decent\" fish for lower prices. \"Decent\" just doesn't cut it anymore- it doesn't taste the same (ack, I sound like such a snob). I agree that the portions are a little small for the price you're paying (the sashimi is a little smaller, the nigiri slices are a little thinner), but the feeling you get when you have a super fresh piece of seared white tuna toro melt in your mouth can't really be replicated anywhere else. Besides, the rolls are very very reasonable ($5-$7 for a decent amount of fish). \n\nMy usual approach is to sit at the bar and try to order off the specials menu on the board. I've come upon amberjack, barracuda, otoro, chutoro, white tuna toro, special squid (raw), giant clam, japanese sardine, spanish mackerel and more. The hamachi toro is forever out of my grasp. I think I've been there 5+ times where it is on the board but sold out for the night. The chef tells me it's because hamachi is a smaller fish, so thus has a smaller belly portion- so they run out faster. I gotta get to this place earlier than 9pm some day. \n\nAnother great thing is the ambiance. Its in a basement, which I typically hate, but having bumping music on weekends, cute lighting and a full bar totally turns this place into a great sushi lounge. And unlike other lounge places, you can get buzzed off beer, lounge and snack on high caliber pieces of fish. They are open until 2! Where else can get you a good drink and delicious Japanese food past 10pm? \n\nI'll usually leave with roughly a $60-$70 bill for my guy and I. Last night we had two Sapporos, complimentary edamame, two miso soups, agedashi tofu, amberjack nigiri, sabagari roll and spicy golden gate roll (our two favorites) and two special salmon skin hand rolls that we got when we asked the chef to make us a \"surprise roll.\" We left full and happy!", "author": "Emily H."}

I liked the vibe of the place, cool, funky atmosphere and dimly lit. Looked like a bar more than a restaurant. Selection is extensive and ranged from your basic sushi rolls to elaborate special rolls. Wanted Donburi something with rice since I was hungry, it was limited so instead got the kurobota pork sausage at $5 per sausage it better have been good.  Bleh! Disappointing!  Got the BEEF OROSHI which was sliced seared beef with grated radish with ponzu sauce not bad, it was the only thing I seemed to enjoy in this place.  Nothing spectacular that I would consider coming back for.  I tried the JUMPING TUNA Spicy tuna, cucumber, and shiso rolled and deep fried since it was one of their more popular items.  It was dry, ingredients were not fresh, rice looked old and when I tried it the bite was forgettable and not mouth watering.  Another thing I tried was the Volcano Roll sounded interesting Deep fried shrimp, and jalapeno, with peanut butter wow was hoping for it to explode in my mouth.  Nope just a weird taste I had with the first roll that I was hoping it to have an acquired taste, hopefully the second roll would taste better, FAIL.  For $13 what a waste.  Basically for everything we ordered it was almost $100 I was left hungry, still starving since I barely touched what we ordered.  I would have been happy and satisfied eating Panda Express.  Not coming back here.  Probably if there was no other place to go and my friends wanted a place to drink and eat since they are open late but not a place I would suggest at all.

You definitely need to get here right at opening, before if possible. The line starts forming and it keeps on going. This place has amazing rolls and all of it is super fresh, which is a rarity at most sushi restaurants nowadays. The fish was not watery nor was the taste dulled, two common signs of frozen sashimi. \n\nMy friend and I visited on a Friday night and we split three rolls, the Dragon roll, 49ers roll and the Orange Delight. The Dragon roll is a favorite of mine and it's a pervasive dish, but this was one of the best I've had. They were generous with the fish roe topping; real, not imitation crab and loads of avocado were on the roll. The eel top was not slathered in sauce so the grill taste seeped through a little bit to add another dimension to the roll. The 49ers roll rocked. The slices of fish were not skimpy, both the tuna and the salmon were sweet and fatty. Lastly, the Orange Delight, something you don't see everywhere was our third selection. It was refreshing! The fatty salmon and avocado were cut through by the acidity of the citrus topping the roll. The cucumber as well as the sweetness from the thin slices of orange added more balance to this choice and it was very unique. I really liked it. In general, none of the rolls were overloaded with rice. The fish were the star of each plate and they were never skimpy. \n\nYou will definitely need to wait if you show up past opening, the only downside. I would gladly wait an hour for a seat!

I've only been there twice now with one of my girls, during the week around actual dinner time (7ish).  It can be a little on the pricey side, but it's so close to Union Square so that's not surprising.  \n\nI don't remember what we had the first time we went there, but this time our edamame was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the Toro sashimi (on special) was fresh and delicious, and the 49er and Dragon rolls were super yummy.  We also had our water glasses / tea cups refilled constantly.   It seemed the the servers were working more as a team, which was cool (multiple servers checked in with us ).  I can't wait go back and try some of their other specials / rolls! \n\nA huge plus about Ryoko's is that it's conveniently located near Union Square, so it's a great spot to grab a bite after doing a little shopping.  It's also a 10-minute walk to the GAMH, which makes it an option for a pre-show dinner! Another after dinner spot it's near is 50 Mason Social House, a cool little wine / beer bar that has live music.  \n\nMy advice to you: Plan ahead and make a \"reservation\" the day before to avoid a wait...otherwise, you'll get to hang with all the other folks who are camped out on the stairs waiting for a table (even during the week).  So, here's how it works: If you call your reservation in, they will simply put your name on the list that everyone else has to sign upon arrival.  When you arrive, let them know, and they cross you off the list and seat you right away!  You only have a 15-minute window (unless you call to tell them you're late), so only make a reservation if you can be on time!", "author": "Amy B."}

The waitress/hostess seemed a bit annoyed (which is fair, we should have had a reservation), however, our group size did not justify her rudeness for the rest of the night. \n\nWe were put in a dimly lit back room with uncomfortable seating. We turned the lights up a bit and the waitress promptly walked in, turned the lights all the way down, and told us off for turning them up in the rudest way possible. This was also the only time we were able to get her attention - she ignored us all night (we contemplated turning the lights up again in hopes she would come back to take our order). After we paid, it took forever for us to get our receipt, even after asking another waitress where it was. Normally, this would not be a big deal, but for the price to quantity ratio at Ryoko's, there is no justification for bad service.\n\nThe only good thing I can say was that the sushi rolls were presented nicely and the fish tasted fresh, despite the fact that half our group watched the other half eat while they waited for their order to come out.\n\nOh yes - they also add an 18% gratuity for groups larger than 5, which was told to us after we were seated.

We walked in and was greeted to the music that the DJ was spinning on top of a piano. Great way to get pumped for a night out. \n\nBest sushi to try: The volcano and The sexy mama \n\nThe volcano are for people who are a fan of peanut butter and spicy food. They have a bit of creamy peanut butter in the middle, along with a slice of jalapeno pepper. It sounds like a weird combination at first, but the sweetness and the creaminess of the peanut butter soothes the kick of the jalapeno pepper. Great, unexpected flavor all in one bite. I've never tasted any other sushi like this. Very yummy! \n\nThe sexy mama is a baked roll. The texture of the baked fish on top was very smooth, it literally melts in your mouth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-11", "description": "So I'm a little hesitant with this review.  Typically, my impressions of restaurants fall generally in line with the consensus view of fellow Yelpers.  In this case, the 700+ reviews for this place skews highly in favor of it.  \n\nAs much as I liked the uniqueness of Ryoko's (open until 2am; somewhat hidden, semi-underground location, clubby music), I found the food to be average at best.\n\nMaybe I just picked the wrong things.  But really, 0 for 6?  I have a better chance of winning the lottery.\n\nThe  list of appetizers is impressive (and that doesn't even include the special items written by hand above the sushi counter).  The agedashi tofu was fresh and tasty ... but pretty much exactly like what I've had at every other sushi place.  The kurobuta sausages come in four bite size mini sausages and again, this was fine but far from blowing my mind.  There was a special appetizer (pork with carrots), which was actually not good at all meat that was quite tough (seemed overcooked).\n\nWe had sushi rolls instead of nigiri (which is maybe where we went wrong as there seemed to be quite a special selection of unusual fish).  The sushi rolls themselves were quite interesting sounding so we went with those.\n\nInitially skeptical of the Volcano Roll (fried shrimp with PEANUT BUTTER, jalapeno, cucumber and fish roe), our server raved about it and said it was the best thing on the menu and was featured on the Food Network.  All right, sure, why not?  I'll tell you why.  It tastes exactly like it sounds.  Having a bite of bland sushi then following it up with a spoonful of peanut butter.  Eh.\n\nAlso had the Hot Tuna roll (spicy tuna), which was actually not bad and I liked the fact that it's whole pieces of maguro instead of mashed up in to a tuna paste.  The Spicy Scallop was not spicy at all but I guess it was a scallop so 50/50 there.  Yay.  By the way, all the rolls ordered come with the nori on the outside (very Korean-like) instead of the rice on the outside (picture California rolls).  Thought it strange.\n\nSo I've come to the following conclusion.  Those who rave about this place probably fall into one of two categores: one, those who had the sashimi and tried what I hear is fresh fish imported from Japan on a weekly basis (and not the rolls or appetizers); or two, those who are not so much fans of raw fish but are late-night clubbers who like to think they've \"experienced\" sushi by coming here and having the surprisingly large selection of non-raw sushi rolls (there are literally at LEAST 20 sushi rolls that are either deep fried, just contain veggies or have cooked unagi (bbq eel).", "author": "F.

I mean the logic is pretty sound considering that restaurants in SF are in fierce competition with each other for business. And that definitely works to our advantage cause then we can sample premium Sashimi. \n\nLet me be frank. I have a top list of Sushi places already and this place has just broken every rule in my Sushi list. I mean you literally eat in a basement below grade which is optimal because you're able to control the temperature of the space. It could be a million degrees outside and raining but downstairs, you're in a good spot. Nice and Cozy. Although a bit cramped, it matches the restaurant's vibe. \n\nMy girl took me here last night and it's definitely a hip happening spot with a saturday night house DJ and Premium Toro. There was so much TORO on the menu! But beware, because you're eating at a premium, expect to pay premium. My girl and I are hardcore sushi eaters and this matched what we were lusting after.

Why, yes, thank you.\n\nThis sushi spot is stationed in what looks like the remains of an old dive bar that closed up shop and forgot to take the DJ with them. Bring a dinner date here and walk through the entrance down a flight of steep stairs. Enter into a dark, cavernous room. In the corner, the DJ spins rhythmic tunes. The wait staff seats you and your date on chairs that are a little too low at tables that are a little too close to the hipsters eating sashimi next to you.\n\nNo matter. Because once you taste the fish, you won't even notice the loud music ringing in your ears or the bad first date conversation you're having. The fish here is fresh and delicious. Rolls are small, but tasty. Even the menu items (salads and appys) are good.\n\nPrices will make your eyebrows raise, especially for the tiny size of the rolls. Beware, because it adds up quickly.

She is a regular at the restaurant and I was quite excited to see what she was raving about. Once we walked into this little gem near Union Square, I knew I was in sushi fun fun heaven. We went on a Tuesday night, not a normal happening night at Ryoko but the vibe was still happening and hip. One reason the atmosphere was so fun was every time a customer entered the restaurant, the entire staff said, \"hello and welcome\" in Japanese. It wasn't your normal boring \"hello\" but a sort of sing song whimsical \"hello\" found in a Disney princess movie. Every time the staff greeted a new customer, I couldn't help but smile. \n\nRyoko's has to be the most hip and happening sushi restaurant in San Francisco. For 23 years they have perfected the sushi experience and it shows. They are open 7 days a week from 6pm to 2am. It's a great late night healthy snack alternative to pizza or a burrito. Plus on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night they have live DJ spinning in the restaurant. \n\nThe sushi and sashimi is super fresh, flown in from Japan and other spots around the world. They offer a daily specials menu with exciting rolls as well as fresh catches. The sushi menu has some amazing rolls with creative SF names such as Spicy Golden Gate, Alcatraz and Humboldt. The bar has a wide selection of hot and cold sake plus a full bar for cocktails and mixed drinks, a rarity in a sushi restaurant. \n\nI will definitely be back to this neighborhood gem.

The quality of the fish was actually really great, but the portions and prices..EH not so great. I do have to say that maybe we just ordered the wrong thing? But my boyfriend feels that a great place shouldn't have a hit or miss menu.\n\nSo, like I've said... The raw items were really good. I just found the portions to small compared to other places I have gone to and also price wise. The Yakitori had only two skewers... tiny skewers at that. Not very good either. \n\nThe sushi seem very small too. Idk about where people go but paying $30+ for just two items was a little intense for me. We ate the two items within five minutes. I pay less or just as much as this at the place near my house for a HUGE/great portioned bento w/ soup/salad, sushi, drinks and great quality. \n\nThe environment wasn't for us. I guess we mainly just like white noise in the background or just people talking... This place was dark and had loud music. I guess if you want sushi and sorta want a club scene, then this is your place. This could be a place to meet someone? Now that I think about it, it's not a place for a couple to hang out and talk. It's more of a place where a group of friends would like to eat, talk very loudly to one another, and get wasted :D\n\nWell, maybe we got the wrong items but I don't think we will be coming back here again. We actually waited here a year ago but the line was a long wait and ended up going down the street to another sushi place.

Beware as 2 pieces of nigiri can easily cost you ~$9, but the quality of the fish definitely makes up for it. \n\nIf you are looking for good value, then get their rolls. I recommend volcano & dragon rolls. they put peanut butter in volcano roll - sounds ridiculous but it's surprisingly a good combination. as for sashimi i recommend white tuna & hamachi toro. a lot of their food is Americanized (ie. rolls) but they also offer daily specials which consist of authentic Japanese dishes \n\nThe crowd tends to be more yuppie oriented and everyone is there to have a good time after a long day/week. They have live DJ towards later part of the night, they usually play hip-hop/house music.

Ryoko's is anything but your average sushi joint.  It is without a doubt my favorite late night sushi place to eat in The City, and is on my list of top sushi places in SF.\n\nYes, there can be a wait, even at 1am - but it's certainly worth waiting for - from the time you walk down the stairs into this almost hidden, underground, jem and the wait staff shouts out greeting you in Japanese.  Then, throughout your dining, and drinking experience, as you walk up the stairs emerging from the underworld, full of tasty sushi, and thinking, yes it's great to live in THE foodie capital of the US - and then the wait staff shouts thanks and have a great night, in Japanese, cementing the experience as a great one that must be repeated.\n\nRyoko's is downtown, in Nob Hill, so take MUNI or BART.  Street parking can be tough, but if you're willing to shell out buck$$$ there is a hidden parking lot adjacent, in the small alleyway.\n\nThey have a large selection of food and rolls, as well as daily specials up on a whiteboard behind the sushi bar.  Weekends they have a live DJ so if you're looking for a fancy, upscale, quiet intimate place, this would not be your place.  It can get a bit loud at times.  The sushi is always fresh and tastes amazing.  The service is friendly, typically fast and attentive, especially considering they are almost always busy, or full.  If there's only two in your party, and you don't mind sitting at the bar, chat up the chefs, buy them a drink, and watch them concoct up some amazing masterpiece for your taste buds to savor.  Or just watch them do it for someone else.  \n\nFood = 5 Stars\nDrinks = 5 Stars\nService = 4 Stars\nAmbiance = 4.5 Stars\n\nIf you're looking for great, fresh, sushi and a fun time then Ryoko's is the place to go.

But other than that, it's the best low-key, late-night, casual atmosphere sushi place in the city.  See my former review below:\n\nI would give this place 5 stars for the quality of the fish alone.  I am a frequent customer who spends $100 per meal at this place on a regular basis. No skimping when I'm in the mood for good sushi.  And recently I've been very annoyed by another regular customer who is served far too much beer and who is permitted to stay and bother single female customers who just want to eat their expensive meal in peace just like any self-respecting businessman would.  The restaurant continues to serve him way too much beer despite his slurred speech, stumbling walk, and harassment of customers.  I have seen him there several times being unpleasant and embarrassing\n.  He needs to be banned.  If I continue to see him there heavily drinking not only will I stop giving this restaurant my business but I will update this review with 1 star and also update my review to advise that attractive young women should avoid this place because they cater to disrespectful drunk older men.\n\nRestaurants and bars: if you want attractive single women to come spend serious money at your establishment, don't cater to cheap drunk douchebags who buy pitchers of beer but not much else and scare off your more desirable customers.", "author": "katie s."}

This is not your typical traditional Japanese Restaurant, you can hear it in the voices of the host, chef, and waitress who greet you when you walk down the stairs. Right when you step foot in Ryoko's, you know this is a fun place to be. The 80's music, dark furnitures, and the piano in the middle of the room. However, the food and quality is ehh okay. They are open till 2 p.m. though.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nMONK FISH LIVER- 4 slices monk fish liver with ponzu sauce. \nKAI MISO SOUP - I can taste the beer in this. yum. And lots of clams.\nHOUSE SALAD - Greens with Sesame dressing\nSABA SHIOYAKI- Grilled and taste yummy. Generous portion.  I don't like the little fish bones (very few) though. \nUNI, AMAEBI, SAKE - Sashimi were okay, had better elsewhere.\nVOLCANO ROLL - Interesting because this have peanut butter in it. It's not mind blowing but different.\nSPICY SCALLOP - Sweet scallop with a hint of spiciness and shiso (mint) leave\n\nCome early if you want to avoid the long wait. And of course, they won't let you walk out quietly. The chef, host, and waitress shouted \"Arigat\u014d and have a good night \" as we walked up the stairs. I left with a big smile on my face.", "author": "Christina W."}

I read all the yelp reviews and 4 stars for couple hundred reviews seemed like good odds to me. I was in a group of 7, so I made reservations a week in advance for 8pm on a Friday night. It was busy, and the service was a bit slow, but pretty fast considering every seat in the house was full. Note: this place is open until 2am, so theres no need to rush!\n\nThe sushi was more like 3 - 3.5 stars. Reasonably priced but all the rolls we got were only 6 pieces. Yummy to say the least, but not perfection. They did have $12 pitchers of Sapporo so that made up for it. If I am remembering correctly, they didnt have any nigiri on the menu which kind of bummed me out. \n\nPoints for a cool atmosphere! We were seated in this back room that had a mirrored wall and some funky blue paint. It felt like we had our own private dinner but we could still hear to DJ. Not the swankiest place, but a very fun environment. I would definitely go back.", "author": "Holl T."}

I've had about half the menu and have yet to try something that hasn't made me want more. Try the Jumping Tuna roll - you will definitely jump from the delicious taste!\n\nI don't agree with the other reviewers who say this place is expensive for what it is - are you kidding?! $7 for a full bottle of sake, $5-$7 rolls (have you been to other SF sushi places?!). I'm a big guy, and can eat a lot. A full meal for 2 will cost you $55 max including drinks & tip. For sushi? And alcohol?! Get outta here!\n\nThey play some great music after 9, before that its a little more chill. This is a good weekday place to take someone if you're looking for low-key intimate, and a fun weekend (Thurs-Sat night) place if you want an upbeat crowd.

Ryoko added this divine spread of the gods to one of its rolls, fused with jalapeno and tempura, to create one of the best accomplishments of human-kind: the volcano roll.  Sure, sushi has been made spicy with the help of spicy tuna and crab, and those are completely and utterly delicious.  But what about taking a nice, polite and established couple such as spicy food and sushi, and turning that into a raunchy and freaky three-way with some rich and creamy peanut butter?!?! \n\nMouth watering yet?  When I learned of the volcano roll, I was drooling.  After partaking in this masterpiece, I can happily say that my expectations were met, and then exceeded.

I was able to get very exploratory with their menu because everything was just superlative. I even had a California roll that was so good that I ordered a couple extra myself (that's a first). Yes I used to think that roll was the weakest thing you could possibly order at a sushi spot, in fact I rarely ever order rolls of any kind, but their preparation had an unsurpassed quality to it that made it irresistible to a crab, sesame, and avocado lover for a mere five dollars.

Out of the many, many sushi places I have dined at Ryoko's remains my favorite. The volcano roll, which oddly combines peanut butter, jalepe\u00f1os and shrimp tempura is magic. The mix of spice from the jalepe\u00f1o, which is tamed by the creaminess of the peanut butter, and the crunch of the tempura battered shrimp makes for an interesting yet scrumptious treat. \nThe quality of the fish is impeccably fresh. The sashimi is so fresh that biting into the fish takes no effort as the morsel falls apart in your mouth like butter. I love the salmon nigiri and white tuna nigiri. The portions can be small and they run out of some fish sometimes, but when they have white tuna it is a must-have. I love to order the 49'ers roll with white tuna substituted for regular tuna. The crunchy crab is another one of my favorites. \nThe place has a disc jockey bumping music on the weekends so the ambiance definitely caters to a partying-type crowd Friday and Saturday nights.

I was \"did that coughing guy behind me on the plane give me swine flu or am I hungry\" hungry.  I didn't know what to do.  My first inclination was to go to Walgreens, stock up on medicine and plan revenge.  Luckily for me, I was with two folks who had a much better idea.\n\nThey brought me to Ryoko.  The place is pretty tiny and not at all trendy.  I was dubious.  I already had swine flu.  What if I picked something else up at this hole-in-the-wall place?  Well, I did pick something up: deliciousness.  \n\nI started with an endless cup of hot green tea.  It was the perfect remedy for my ailment.  Before we tore into novel pieces of maki, we started with an appetizer.  We had fried cheese sticks.  Fried cheese sticks at a sushi place?  I _know_!  They were like fried mozzarella sticks, but served in wonton paper and accompanied by a spicy sauce.  I didn't try the sauce because it was mayo based, but the sticks were flavorful and unexpected for the locale.  That was the preview.  The real deal were the maki.  We got six different rolls.  My favorite was the spicy scallop - but we ate gigantic rolls topped with avocado, tempura, roe and other wondrous things.  My diner companions raved about a roll that had peanut butter in the middle of it.  I tried it.  I didn't kill me...but I don't think I ever need it in my life again.  I loved eating maki in a city that sits on the Pacific.  Everything tasted fresher and I enjoyed the fish that much more.  The service was friendly and helpful and my experience was a good one.  If back in the neighborhood, I can see myself being up for a return visit despite my Jeremy Piven-borne fear of raw fish.\n\nSushi devoured, we made leave of the restaurant and I went to my hotel room quite satisfied that I would survive my coughed/sneezed on experience.

We called Ryokos because the reviews were great but they would not take any orders over the phone, even with a credit card. After walking some 12 blocks I was told there would be at least a 45 minute wait. The extremely nice and personable hostess, after sensing my disappointment (displeasure) made an exception and told me she would get the kitchen to produce in 15 minutes. I was really happy with that and ordered a beer while I waited in the tiny (overstatment) entry way. The place was busy, loud and looked like a lot of fun. A very ecceltic scene that was populated by a younger crowd of people who looked like they had been there before and were enjoying themselves.\nAs I waited 3-4 more parties walked in and they were told that it would be 45-75 minute wait. With no place to stand they stayed on the stairs leading down to the dining room. They didn't seem surprised. i did like the atmosphere.\nAfter the wonderful hostess sent me on my way (she received a nice tip) I noticed that the bag seemed pretty light. Once I got back to the hotel I found out why. The portions were really small. This certainly isn't the only sushi place to scrimp on the size but it is always disappointing to me and why I either avoid unknown sushi places or eat close to a burger joint so when I'm done I can get something to eat. We had 2 hot dishes, garlic prawns and fried octopus. Both were excellent, wish we had more. The flavors were wonderful. We had 3 rolls. One was bad, something about a Jumping Tuna. It just tasted foul. Our dogs did like it. The other 2 rolls were very good. A volcano roll and something like a checker board with 2 different types of tuna. Certainly good choices.

We enjoyed the music and the cozy feel of the restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers and a roll. Recommended by the waitress, I got a cha-cu with calpico drink, it was yummy and strong enough (which doesn't take much) to give me a good buzz. :) They give out complimentary edamame to start. The orange delight roll was just so-so, nothing special. The best dish we tried was the Tempura appetizer, which came fresh out of the batter and the dipping sauce had a distinctly unique flavor with ginger and dashi. The tempura was lightly breaded, the way it should be! \n\nOverall, the food was average, though the menu has a good selection of appetizers.

I've been eating here for years and to date it is the best sushi place I've ever had! Nevermind that this place isn't a fancy restaurant with white table cloths and silver chopsticks - I'm there for the good sushi! If you're indifferent about the quality of sushi, then you can find plenty of places that will serve you average sushi at a cheap price.\n\nI love the variety of fish and the different styles of sushi that the chefs serve up.  What I love is the variety of flavors you get from high quality fish. Bad sushi tastes the same no matter where you eat. But here you're in for a treat. What looks like a basic piece of nigiri is never that. For example, the salmon's flavor is spiked with some lemon zest and other cuts of fish will have their own individual flavors. Amazing! In addition, if you are brave you can allow the chefs to put your order together. They will often make things that are not on the menu or give you some rare cuts of fish.  These special meals are always delicious.\n\nOk, yes, this place is located in a basement. It does not look fancy, but like I said, you're paying for good food not fancy decorations. Expect to spend a lot here - good fish will cost you. In addition, the food here is addictive! Believe me, it's all worth it. My favorite, Spanish mackerel.\n\nThere are two types of good sushi places:\n\n1. A \"good\" sushi place where you get a lot of mediocre sushi for cheap;\n\n2. A great sushi place where you get high quality sushi that tastes amazing and will get you hooked on their fish.\n\nThis place is #2.\n\nSpecial thanks to Chef Atsushi for introducing me to some great food!", "author": "Carlos R."}

I stay at the bar, looking at the two guys preparing dozens of interesting rolls with juicy fish tails and eggs sticking out from the rice.  \n\nBut, this time, I'm tempted by the chef's choice of sashimi and I go for it. What I get is rather disappointing: 14 small pieces of good quality fish (especially the mackerel and the yellowtail), but not the best choice in consideration of what is on display just in front of me. But, ehi!  for 30$ I would have expected much better. No scallops, no albacore tuna, no fatty tuna, no shrimp. Ridiculous.  \n\nAs dessert, I take some balls of green tea ice cream, which are partially frozen, ordinarily good and surely not unforgettable. \n\nI like the young and noisy atmosphere.

Especially impressive is their selection of simple yet creative maki.  For example, I ordered a variation of a spicy tuna roll with shiso leaves, a salmon and caper roll with shiso (I love those leaves!), an eel/tomago roll with spicy roe, and a smoked salmon roll with avocado and asparagus. \n\nEach roll was delicious and fresh tasting, made with melt-in-my-mouth fish.  We also got a fried rice ball that was salty, crispy, hot, and awesome!  I had a seaweed and cucumber salad that used a much better and fresher type of seaweed than I expected, but I found the dressing a little too straight-up vinegary...it could have used just a touch of sweetness, imo.  Next time I'd skip the salmon rice ball.  It was unfried and wrapped in seaweed with a little pocket of cooked salmon in the middle...not at all what I expected.  The plain fried one was so delicious and filling that there was no need for it, and it paled in comparison.  I can't have milk products, but my boyfriend insists that the mochi he had for dessert is the best he's ever had...and he's quite a foodie, so I trust that assessment.  \n\nThe service was very quick and attentive until we were finished.  We had to wait around at least 10 minutes after we were done eating before we could catch a server's eye to ask for the check. \n\nThere were two of us, and we got out of there for less than $50, which is a huge plus for us!

( .. and you'll continue to hear it for every single person that steps through the door after you as well ... )\n\nI went in solo on a weekday evening and was seated at the bar promptly.  The atmosphere is sort of a mixture of bar and sushi restaurant - and includes plenty of dark tucked away seating.  There is club music bumping in the restaurant which made the whole experience feel kind of \"young\" and \"edgy\".\n\nI ordered a mid-priced sake which was served in a rocks glass - literally on the rocks - with a lemon.  This method was a first for me - but it was good!  You get a complimentary dish of edamame and that one soup as well. (brain fart.  you know the soup.)  Nice to tide your tummy over as you wait for the main thing.  All brought out very quickly by an exceptionally polite server.\n\nFood:\nMy main event was a \"chef's choice\" nigiri, 7 piece, and a california roll.  (The california roll came with my combo, otherwise I'd not have gotten it.)  The nigiri was a pretty typical selection and included some fatty tuna, some eel, some prawn, and a bunch of other stuff that I don't know what it was.  The rice was not the most exciting - it seemed a little crumbly and dry - but the fish was definitely fresh.  The california roll was only so-so - but then again, I don't really ever order these so maybe it's just me.\n\nThe wasabi was the bright green kind (read: cheap) and the soy sauce was pretty salty (read: cheap).  These did not contribute to an overall thrilling experience for my tongue, but the fish on the nigiri was fresh and that goes a long way for me.\n\nDessert was green tea ice cream mochi --- which was a delight!  They brought it out chopped into 8 wedges and supplied whipped cream and cherry (not necessary at all, but oh well).\n\nImpressions:\nOk, it's not a top of the line authentic sushi experience, but it was totally legit and the atmosphere was kind of campy and quaint.  Coupled with fresh fish and totally excellent service, I would definitely consider Ryoko's if you are in the area.  I would NOT try to impress a sushi snob here - it wouldn't work out, but the prices are pretty low for what it is - and you'll most likely walk out happy.\n\nGive it a shot - and get the green tea ice cream mochi!", "author": "Michael E."}

I have to say he was right! I showed up on time for my reservation for 12 with one of my friends. We were seated right away, even with only us 2, which was awesome since some places make you wait for the whole party, and with 12 people some are bound to be late. I was told over the phone that I would have the area for 2 hours, which seemed reasonable. \n\nThe rest of my party finally trickled in and we ordered quite a few drinks. I like that this place has extra large sakes and pitchers of beer which is nice for big groups of drinkers like my friends. I ordered to jumping tuna, which was a spicy tuna fried roll. It was decent and had a yummy dipping sauce. \n\nThe only little bit of drama we had was the waitress informed us we had to leave by 9:15 but my reservation was at 7:30 so I didn't know why we lost that 15 min I was told we had. After going to back and forth with our waitress she finally said we would get the check at 9:15, which made more sense. I think it was more the manager, not the waitress, because she was really sweet. She even brought out a free desert for my birthday. The total bill ended up being only about $30 a person (I didn't even pay). I was shocked it was so low because we ordered A LOT of drinks.\n\nBasically this place is really great for large groups and if you're going to be out with friends, I'm not sure it's for people looking for the freshest sashimi or sushi connoisseur. But the food was decent and I had a great bday experience there.", "author": "Christine C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-11-23", "description": "Let me start off by everything that I write is through my personal experience only. I was invited to a birthday party here and this place was picked due to their high rating and good reviews. But honestly after eating here I would never return, even if its for someones birthday and I had to show face by going. \n\nWe started off with a small room for our party of 8 people. Maybe this place wasn't too well set up for parties but I felt a little claustrophobic in that small room that was stuffy and nothing but a costco type fan to circulate air. Our waiter started us off by asking us what we wanted to drink and we replied by tea for now as we were looking at the menu. He informed us it as a 2 dollar charge for each person. Well that was a complete turn off after he said that. 2 dollar charge each person for the same type of tea that any other japanese restaurant serves for free. Maybe I would understand if it came with the tea bag but NOT EVEN. I'm sorry but the two major things that I think should be free are tea and rice from how I was brought up in san francisco. And for those ridiculous prices they couldn't even give us the tea for free. Sad again it wasn't even a tea pot. . . they just refill your cup whenever you go low. \n\nSo some of us etched for tea and the others got water instead. We had ordered some sushi plates and sashimi and in my opinion they weren't worth the prices they charged and they were very stingy on the wasabi. Even one of my friends had said that \"I guess wasabi is a scarce thing around here\". Lets just say we had to ask him for more wasabi more than once. I have eaten at a lot of high end sushi places and it was worth the expensive prices they charge but this place I have to tell you wasn't horrific tasting, but simply not worth it. But one dish got my blood boiling when it came out. We had ordered a dozen fresh oysters. I enjoy eating fresh oysters once in a while but I usually get them at happy hour for 1 dollar a piece. This place was 2 dollars and 50 cents which I was totally fine with IF it tasted good. When he brought them out they were dinky little pieces. . . I mean the size of a pinky. Some of the oysters wasn't even a whole oyster. It was a simple sliver of slime masked with as much sauce to cover it up as they could. I tried not to make a big deal due to the fact that it was my sisters birthday but enough is enough. I complained to the waiter and he was baffled in how to find an excuse for that repugnance display of an oyster they had in front of me. All he could say was that he had to speak to the manager. So I expected an apology or something, as a business which makes a mistake should, to save an unhappy customer but all I got was \"we will refund you for the oysters you did not eat\". No sorry my apologies for trying to cheat you, or don't worry about this dish all together for we will not charge you for the half that you ate, but a cheap way of cutting their losses. I mean what kind of business sense does this place have? I have gone to chevy's with better service than this and this is suppose to be a higher end restaurant? \n\nI was so outraged at the type of service and food they had that I had told myself that I refuse to eat anything else in my own mind. As the mid part of the meal started to come everyone decided on their own that they have had enough of this place as well and we planned to go to another restaurant to have better and more food. For 300 dollars plus worth of food that we had ordered here didn't satisfy any of us. So I said I was going to ask for the check and to get our cake that we had brought in for the birthday girl back so that we would have a more enjoyable environment but my friend saw how upset I was with this place that he opt to do it for me. Unfortunately he misunderstood me and instead of asking for the check and wanting back the cake he told the waiter he wanted to eat the cake now. It was ok because it was a simple mistake so the waiter brought out our cake and we sung happy birthday to the birthday girl. What was missing you ask? No cutting knife or serving plates. He just brought out the cake and spoons. Again fully disgusted at the service. What did he expect us to do? 8 people eat the cake off the serving plate with spoons like neanderthals eating a boar after a kill? We were so exhausted with all this bull that we just told the waiter to bag the cake because we didn't even want to eat it there anymore. We got the check and paid for it and had to go to another restaurant to resume our night. I was so appalled at this place that I wanted to make it better or at least inform the manager of our experience. The manager was really nice and apologized for our experience but I had told her that it was unfortunate but we would not come back ever again and that the time that they could have saved our unhappy experience had passed.", "author": "Joey P."}

That being said however, I think this place is just an ok in my book.\n\nFirst, the positives.  I have to give this place some props for the ambiance.  It's got some energy to it.  Definitely a good place to catch up with your friends to recap in full gory details last weekend's bar jaunts.  Though as with most places in San Francisco, this place is small and I wouldn't recommend going with a group of more than 4 or 5 unless you don't mind waiting.  We went pretty early on a Thursday night (630) and we were seated pretty quickly.  However, by the time we left (745) there was already a line.  At dinner, you could tell they were trying to push us out of our table as quickly as possible (minus points for that too).  \n\nTheir specials were appealing - they were serving all kinds of exotic fish.  They even had fish flown straight from Japan.  I will note that to self next time I'm back.  Seeing as its open until 2 am, despite my not-so-glowing comments that follow, I can definitely see myself coming back.  \n\nSo as for the food itself - the first time I came here was for a large group birthday party (they seat you in the little back room and you all get to sit on the floor like kindergarteners) and while it was definitely nice to be able to try a bunch of different rolls that way, nothing really stood out to me.  They definitely have a lot that you can choose from but overall the food here is just average.  Last night I decided to go with my usual.  And at $24, their Chirashi is $10 more than it should be for the quality of the fish.  Their fish selection was no spring chicken.  It had that defrosty flavor/consistency to it.

The standout was uni that tasted sweet, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth aah-mazing and this is coming from someone that usually describes uni as \"what one would imagine fish poop to taste like.\" Plus another point for ingenuity on a roll with peanut butter. Everything I wanted and never even thought to ask for in one place, Ryoko has earned a permanent spot in my SF rotation.", "author": "Amy L."}

It's what any Japanese place should be in my book. I was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem tucked away just a few blocks from Union Square. More credit to Yelp for finding great places I may never go to otherwise.\n\nI booked a spot for 9 people and they were very good about getting us to our table in the back of the restaurant. I'm usually a fan of places with windows, but with Ryoko's being in the basement of a building, I had to make do with the mood lighting in the place, which I actually got used to by the end of my visit.\n\nIn terms of the food they have here, it was great. Everything I had was fresh and I think the biggest test was that I had some first time sushi eaters with me and in this critical juncture in their lives, I got a tasty nod of approval from all of them at the end of the night. Success!\n\nTheir selection is great here, they have a crazy variety of rolls here, some experimental, but everything still seems to work. And my favorite part is that the prices are extremely reasonably, I think our bill came out to about 10/15 a person and we were all satisfied with what we got.\n\nCome late and enjoy the DJ as well! The music is again another nice touch for this overall great place.", "author": "Roland C."}

REAL TRADITIONAL NIPPON CUISINE!  A variety of appetizers, rolls, entrees for your pleasure.  Fish that melts in your mouth!  Big chunky slices of fish in your rolls (5 pieces)!

I generally believe we have more to offer than some crazy shit show after one too many on a Thursday night. \n\nMost of the time. However, after seeing how highly rated Ryoko is, with so many reviews ignoring the actual food, and instead siting the DJ, the crowd, the sake, the beer and the fact that they stay open late so you can eat sushi instead of pizza while fucked up, I am starting to question if I give this online community a little too much credit. \n\nThis restaurant is in a basement and, if you did not have your beer goggles on while dining, you would realize that the dim lighting can not hide the fact that it is pretty run down and dirty, just like a...... basement. You might also notice, if you weren't  juiced up on late night sake that probably was a follow up to any number of deadly cocktails, that the prices vs. quality and quantity are something they could only pull off for tourists who do not know any better and late night drunks.\n\nSo, fellow yelpers, I know this place is open late, but really, 4 and 5 stars? Even I have fallen victim to a few late night rolls here, made with ingredients that are more suited for a third graders bag lunch sandwich than anything that should be paired with fish, rice or seaweed, but lets not let a little drinking problem taint reality. \n\nThis place is mediocre at best.... and that is after a few too many drinks.", "author": "Drue C."}

At past midnight when we left, the DJ was still going strong and it made me wonder if people stay at the bar until closing time. \n\nSecond and perhaps more importantly, the food was AMAZING. Everything I tried was extremely fresh, full of flavor and extremely tender (well, the sashimi at least - the octopus was appropriately rubbery)! I highly recommend the rolls that they flash fry in oil - it's just lightly fried on the outside of the rice, not heavy at all, and the inside is perfectly warm (which was delicious with the unagi & avocado combo in mine). I'm not a tempura person or a huge fried food person, but this was simply amazing - cannot recommend it enough. The other two surprises were the monkfish liver pate (if you like foie gras or liver, give it a try) and the fried baby mackerel, which were like grown up fish sticks, if you will. \n\nThis is the first sushi restaurant that I've been to in SF that truly inspires me to rush back soon - especially late-night because of its good energy from the DJ.

They were delicious, with just the right sweetness for me. I thought the price point for the chirashi was about right, at ~20 dollars. We also ordered a 20 dollar rainbow roll, and we were expecting something amazing from a 20 dollar roll. While I admit the presentation was really pretty- artfully arrayed on a big square black plate with various decorations- the rainbow roll was disappointingly ordinary.

It was friday, so I understand a bit of a wait, but not an excuse to make sushi rolls that fall apart.\n\nWe waited over 1 hour to be seated.  My bf complained to the owner that the chicks were seating others before us, even though we were above them on the list.  She compensated with free beer which did nothing for me since I chose not to drink that night.\n\nI do like the atmosphere and the dj, but the place is way small and the sushi was mediocre.  I had been here years before and the quality I remember was much better.  Tempura was delivered 20 minutes after all the rolls came out, which I thought was weird.  Garlic shrimp was overcooked.  \n\nShould have went to Japantown.  I won't be returning to Ryoko's.", "author": "Marcia D."}

First of all, they don't allow you to order food for take out, even if you are eating there and you want to take your leftover food to go, they won't allow you, the most stupid rule ever for any restaurant. Then you have to wait on a staircase until u are seated right next to door that doesn't close, so your forced to wait while you are freezing. Then when you finally order your food, they take long as if they are perfecting your order before serving it to you. But when you finally recieve your food, it looks as if they got it out of package they bought at Safeway, and it tastes that way as well. Bottom line, if you enjoy good sushi, please save your time and avoid eating here.

Talk about a surprising little hole-in-the-wall... this place had to be some sort of crazy lounge before it was a sushi joint.  The layout is unique, the walls are bright blue, and there is a piano in the middle of the front room. They play CDs straight through (we made it through the best of New Order and began on Green Day's American Idiot before we left).  It doesn't feel like a sushi restaurant so much as a sushi scene.\n\nService: Several waitresses helped us, and each one was incredibly friendly.  There was never a wait between running out of roll/sake and being offered more.  My boyfriend arrived at the restaurant five minutes before me, and when I got there, there was already food on the table.  Ka-Zow!  These guys are good!\n\nCONS:\n\nAtmosphere: The carpet is old.  Like, skeezy old.  And dirty... stained with the smoke of  a thousand cigarettes from the time-before-sushi.\n\nFood: The rolls we had were tasty, but nothing special.  They were a little greasy (and I'm not talking the deep fried ones) and a little fishy.  That is to say, the fish didn't seem to be incredibly fresh.  Overall, it was nothing special... and ultimately, you don't go to a restaurant for the blue walls and the New Order album - you go because you want the food to blow you away.

It was very good.  It wasn't greasy at all.   We were happy that they had the Moro available.  That was absolutely delicious!!  But is was $18.00 for 2 pcs!!  The hamachi and maguro were pretty tasty.  The miso soup with clam was also very good.  \n\nNot so good: The sushi rolls were not that tasty.

I've missed my California amaebi (this is where I landed by FOBby ass after-all) and this seemed...not bad. Could have been a bit sweeter and fresher. Everything else was not memorable, somehow. Oysters fresh but had fresher. Tuna good but had better. Checkerboard...not worth it. Is this a problem...scratching my head. Trying to re-adjust expectations. Ok.

Used Yelp to find a new place to eat and came across Ryoko's. It was a quick walk, about a couple blocks, from Union Square and really close to ACT and the Curran if you're going to see a show. We got there around 6 and there were already quite a few people there, but we didn't have to wait for a table (though thirty or so minutes later the sign-in sheet at the front was being used). The place looked a lot different than I expected; it used to be a bar and didn't have any of that tacky pseudo-Japanese decor. It had more of a lounge-y feel than a restaurant. There's a small sushi bar converted over from a regular bar and there's quite a bit of seating as well as a (baby?) grand piano. \n\nThe food itself was priced fairly. We ordered an order of chicken teriyaki, two rolls, and the tofu salad. The chicken teriyaki was surprisingly good. The chicken wasn't dry and the portion size was substantial. The tofu salad was great too. Loved the dressing, though it could have used a bit more tofu (there was only two pieces). The rolls were great though! They were fresh, and the fish and eel in them were both great quality. I would say the rolls were a little on the small size, but they weren't awfully expensive either, so I guess they were fairly priced. Definitely should have ordered more food. We left a bit hungry, but didn't have time to order anything else as we had to head to the theater. The service here was great. The waitress was attentive and they have quite a few workers there to take away dishes and refill drinks. The beer was a steal too. Four bucks for a pretty large glass of tap beer. \n\nI'll definitely be back! Service was great. Food was delicious.

My boyfriend and I came in at 10 or 11pm one night, and we liked the ambiance.  The restaurant is actually below ground level and very dark.  It's a good place to go eat if you feel like having a more private dinner, without people staring at you.\n\nI really liked the Jumping Tuna sushi, a deep-fried spicy tuna roll that comes with a spicy/sweet/sticky dipping sauce.   \n\nI also liked the Albacore nigiri, which was garnished with a little bit of grated ginger, ponzu sauce and green onions.  The fish here is very fresh, and the owners are all Japanese!  \n\nThey tend to use Japanese mint a lot in their rolls so if you're not a fan, you might want to ask them to not include it.  I actually like the juxtaposition of cold sashimi and the subtle mint flavor.  The one thing I don't like about Japanese mint is that it has a rough texture, and this roughness is accentuated when paired with the buttery, smooth texture of raw fish.", "author": "Jen Y."}

It feels like you're having dinner at a bar, but instead of eating greasy bar food, you're having great sushi!  The music was kind of loud in this place, but that's part of its charm.  It's also not so loud where you wouldn't be able to hold a conversation with someone.\n\nI really liked the sashimi... the fish was fresh and delicious.  We also ordered a dragon roll, and it was really good, but I've had better dragon rolls elsewhere.  Did I mention, however, that the sashimi is really good??  \n\nI also love how this place has a full bar, which most Japanese places don't.  I ordered a Shocu with peach tea (Japanese vodka, according to our waitress), and it was okay.  I think I was expecting something different, which is probably why I didn't enjoy it as much.

Very cute waitress/servers.\nThe sushi was, at least today GRADE A! I'm sorry I don't want to misspell any of the items I sampled so here they are in English:\n-Soft Shell Crab deep fried, light crispy crust with nice dipping sauce.\n-White tuna belly.....Holy s**t no doubt the single most ,melt in ur mouth delishousness I've had in my sushi mouth(at least for the next 20 min. or so)\n-Gooey Duck clam, u know the \"nasty\" looking one. It was the texture that's unique here. Very firm, almost crunchy, like undercooked artichoke stem and mild and tasty.\n-Sweet shrimp. I always get this because I LOVE the bonus tempura heads! The shrimp was super fresh,sweet, and melted on first chew! with the subtle pop of fresh rowe to follow....dang.The Heads: brainy, and meaty, and crunchy goodness!\n-Sea Urchin....my first.....I had no idea! I am now baptised! If u like sushi and have yet to try this gem of the sea, u better get urself here when It's as fresh as my new sushi chef friends said this was. This is now the New! single most piece of creamy delishousness I've ever eaten! GET IT! AT ANY COST!\n-Finally when I told the chef of my luv for taco(octopus), asked to make me something \"taco special\". Super super fresh octopus(sashimi), according to directions, first dipped in a green tangy, salty powder dip?, then in a lemon/saki bath. Aaahhhh I was DONE!

Not.\n\nI had initially planned to celebrate myself at an upscale Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco.  \n\nBut at the last minute, a little voice inside me said \"I gotta have sushi!\"  \n\nWhen I gotta have sushi, I gotta have sushi.\nLike serious gotta have it gotta have it.  \nLike Nola Darling  gotta have it gotta have it.\n\nMy go-to sushi in the East Bay is Angelfish.  It's the best around here, in my opinion.  But for my special day I wanted something different.  And more importantly, I wanted a real cocktail.  Just sake was not going to fly.  This was my 21st birthday, after all.\n\n*stink eye*\n\nSpeak.\nNot.\n(Bitch.)\n\nAnd so I turned to my Yelp friends to lead me in the right direction.  In a matter of minutes the phenomenally fabulous Frisco J. and sexy cybergoddess Jessica V. turned me on to Ryoko's.  I didn't question the decision for a minute.  I knew these two would make sure this nubile nymphet was satisfied on her special day.\n\nWhen I arrived at Ryoko's it was kind of early in the evening and I was a little surprised at how understated the place was.  We were seated at a little table near the bar and promptly ordered Grey Goose cocktails. \n\nIt was so cool to finally be able to drink as a legal adult!\n\n*stink eye*\n\n(Bite. \nMe.)\n\nWhen the sushi came it was really good.  Definitely as good as my beloved Angelfish.  Actually, it was probably even better.  Everything from the hamachi to the kampachi was on point.  I tend to think a sushi bar is only as good as its uni, and let me tell you, that sushi chef  at Ryoko's served up the coldest, sweetest, creamiest, most aphrodisiacal uni I have ever had in my life.  \n\nWithin about twenty minutes of our arrival the feel of the place began to change.  The tables filled quickly.  There was a line out the door.  The twinkle lights that lined the walls came on. Donna Summer began to play. \"Bad Girls\" piped through the speakers.  I started to feel as though I was in some hot little niche in the floating world of Tokyo.  \n\nHey Mister!  \nToot toot!\nBeep beep!\n\nI was having such a lovely time there at Ryoko's, drinking my legal Grey Goose cocktails, sipping my legal sake, savoring the firmness of the giant clam in my mouth,  when something happened.  \n\nThe \"Bad Girls\" track ended.  \nAnd then...\n\nMac. Arthur. Park.  \n\nKill my buzz why don't you, Donna?\nAnd before I even get to eat my muthafucking cake.\n\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\nAll the sweet, green icing flowing down...\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\nI don't think that I can take it\n'cause it took so long to bake it\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again\nOh, no!\n\nThat bitch. \nTalking 'bout I'll never have the motherfucking recipe again.  \nTears filled my eyes.  I felt old.  \nFuck you, Donna!  This is MY 21st birthday!!! \n(Eat.\nMe.)\nHOW DARE YOU?! \n\nBut being twenty-one (bite *stink eye* me) and kinda drunk, it didn't get me down for too long. By the time \"Last Dance\" came on I was enjoying my night again, begging the Japanese girls with the permed mullets at the table next to me to hold me, to scold me.  Cuz when I'm bad I'm oh so bad.  \n\nThat night I acted pretty silly for an adult.  If it hadn't been my 21st birthday, it might have even been inappropriate.\n\nBut I got away with it, you know, because you only turn twenty-one once.", "author": "Tsada K."}

Between 3 girls, we were able to devour 7 rolls. The spicy jumping tuna rolls, which are quickly fried in tempura but still keep the tuna from being fully cooked, are a must order. The spicy scallop roll melts in your mouth. Be warned that their spicy rolls are SPICY! One friend's eyes were watering so badly and the other's nose was runny! But they still loved it. The Tiger roll, which is shrimp tempura with mayo, was so good that we ended up ordering another roll of it. The delicious California roll has fresh shredded crab in it. The rolls average about $10 each, so although this place is kind of divey, you really pay for the quality of food you're served.\r\n\r\nMake sure you also get a few bottles of Nigori sake to go with your meal.

The peanut butter coated my mouth  with a sweet and salty creaminess, which was contrasted by the crunchiness of the fish. The downer was the uni roll--the taste was briny, like getting splashed by a gallon of  seawater in your mouth; and refreshing, like a crisp morning onshore breeze, but the texture, uhhggggggg, its like eating a curd of green phlegm, from your grandma, barfing material.

It could have been a little bit bigger portions and I would have been super happy.\nThird, Service was amazing!  Made quick friends with Waitress/Bartender, a real cutie who hooked me and my lovely lady up.  This was the selling point.  Beer (Sapporo), Saki, and even some delicous dessert...gratis.\nWent during the week so crowds came and left...good music and overall great experience.  \nMy GF thought the bathroom situation was strange...she had to walk upstairs and Mens was about 15 feet away.\n\nI will go back next time I'm in the City.

The first was at a table for two (a date! with a boy!), the second at the sushi bar.  I'll start with the negative and end on a positive.\n\nThe date: pretty shoddy.  Not only was our little table positioned awkwardly near the huge piano in this dungeon, but also the 6 inches of space between me and the piano seemed to be needed as a major thoroughfare for the waitrons.  But okay, it's Friday night and it's packed.  I'll accept that.\n\nBut i definitely won't accept ordering sashimi along with a number of other cooked items and rolls, and getting the sashimi item LAST, and only after repeated reminders to that effect.  no, just wrong.  The order of operations in a japanese dinner is always:  sashimi, then cooked fish, then whatever else.\n\nI can't even remember if the food was any good that night, because I was so put off by the service.  But I must have given 4 stars for a reason...\n\n...oh right.  I came back here a few nights ago by myself, in search of a few hits of uni and aji.  I tell you, sitting at the sushi bar interacting with the oft-mentioned \"rock 'n' roll sushi chef\" is the way to go.  Even better is when this guy's buddies show up and start heckling him in Japanese.  And if you happen to know Japanese yourself, well!\n\nThe food definitely did not disappoint.  I will spend the bucks for geoducks, so to speak; on this particular occasion I splurged on the sashimi and nigiri a la carte.  I was pleasantly surprised when the generously-heaped uni came wrapped in a strip of halbut. sugokuoishii!  amazingly great.  \n\nI like how they usually have a few special fish that came from special places -- like this time I had blue fin tuna from Italy (!?).  Even the Salmon Skin roll, which I sort of offhandedly ordered just to fill me up, was something special.\n\nHip atmosphere?  Dunno about that.  I think fellow reviewer Shiho got it right when he called it \"Japanese 80s vibe\".  The neighborhood draws in a lot of suits as well as late-night revellers, so it feels to me like a high-roller hotspot straight out of an 80s action flick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-17", "description": "I am going to be very frank with you.  There are two Japanese restaurants I have eaten at that merit 5 stars: Sushi Ran and Akaoni.  There are 2 other restaurants which have the possibility of achieving the bvu coveted 5 star ranking: Zushi Puzzle and Tekka.  In getting this 5 star award and an e-pat on the back, every detail of the meal must be perfect, and by perfect, even the wood that rests my laurels.\n\nA much anticipated winterbreak for the  toy puzzle giving, timidly salacious strumpet led her to take the bus to meet me and my office of employment where we'd trek down Union Square in search of the perfect interview/work shirt.  After going through many departments when we should have just gone to Style & Co., she remembered a sushi restaurant that her brother had been raving about.  Yelping it, we followed googlemaps to Ryoko.  It seemed like a hotspot as it was around 8 pm and there was a throng of people outside, waiting to be seated.  Walking into the dimly lit den, I was immediately pleased by the aesthetics.  It has a lounge like atmosphere with seductive lighting and plush seats.  It screams sake sake sake.  We were tenth on the list, however, the kind waitress who asked the person in front of us to pronounce names on the list seated us in about 10 minutes.  Showing us our table, we literally shared it with another couple.  We were separated by nothing; I could listen and chime in their convo and they could mine...we were so close I could have forcep'd a piece of their sushi with ease.   The waitress gave us edamame on the house and was very attentive with the surface.  We ordered:\n\n1.  agedashi tofu: this tofu was not very good.  it came already drenched in the sauce and it was soggy and not crispy at all.  also, there were only 3 measly pieces.  i am a big tofu fan and this was sub-par.\n\n2.  philly roll: this was very good.  it was unique in that they didn't wrap it with another layer of rice.  their scruples are up to par with mine in that they don't try to cheaply fill you up.  \n\n3.  jumping tuna: this was my favorite roll.  it was a deep fried roll and came with a type of dipping sauce...a kind of sweet n sour sauce.  it was delicious.\n\n4.  crunchy crab: i read on yelp that this was a fan favorite.  however, it was my least favorite.  it tasted rather ordinary and dry.\n\n5.  orange delight: this roll was a little bit more expensive and i could see why.  you can tell a good sushi restaurant by the quality of the fish they put on top of their rolls and the sake tasted just like the sake sashimi i ordered.  it was buttery and most savory.  \n\nWe also ordered the sake and toro sashimi.  Both were buttery and the toro just melted in my mouth.  The serveurs were very prompt and came to our table in a timely fashion to check up on us.  Everything was nearly perfect except for the tofu, yet, those three pierces proved to be their downfall in achieving the coveted bmeister 5 star co-sign.\n\nUpon leaving, there was still a line and even a couple sitting on the steps drinking asashis.   I should have stuck out my cup and asked for a pour. Ho ho ho and a bottle of rum, a pirate's life for me.  Everybody should frequent a joint where they allow hooligans to toss back a brewski and not even be seated.", "author": "Brian V."}

We had to wait for soy sauce and water so long that we got up and got it ourselves. Lame.

The toro... I am not a fan of toro normally but this one...it was not so fatty but just perfectly melts in your mouth like heaven! It is torched for a sec by the chef right before served so it is slightly warm.. mmmmm.  \nI think hamachi was the second best, very fresh. \nOrange delight is a roll with fresh salmon in top. I think it needs sliced lemon for perfection but it was still very tasty. \nPork katsu was actually a bigger portion than I expected, thick juicy cut of kurobuta. I've had better in Japan in my own hometown but probably one of the best in SF. :) Dragon roll had good eel, which is important part of this roll. Normally dragon comes with ebi tempura but this one comes with crab... oh well.  \nIkura was... just OK, actually not good for the price, and for the fact that they had it up on the board as special, it should be damn good, but it wasn't at all. It was too cold and the flavor was meeeeh...  \nBig eye tuna was the most expensive sushi on the menu- $8.5 or something even above the toro, and it was just an average.

There is often a DJ and they are open late which makes it a good spot to stop by after a long night. In some of the reviews below people mentioned that this place is not very Japanese, however I would beg to differ. Based on my experiences in Tokyo, Ryokos feels like many of the tucked away sushi bars I went to that in Tokyo. I think its pretty authentic to the feel of some of the more hole in the wall places in Japan. \n\nAmbiance aside, the main reason this place rocks is the fish. I don't think I have found a sushi restaurant in the city with better nigiri. They have a great selection and man, you have got to try the Fatty Toro.

She was like, Toro, I said, \"Haha, I know what you are trying to do, and no.\"  Toro, by the way is tuna belly and always very expensive.

We were having trouble finding that Something, as both of us were totally new to SF. As we walked, the neighborhood started to feel a little bit residential, and we were drifting toward the Tenderloin, so we turned and started bumbling down a steep hill toward Union Square instead. We were astonished to suddenly see a quaint doorway on our right. We both paused, looked at each other, and, nodding assent, pushed our way through the doors.\n\nThe narrow stairs led down into a dim, cavernous sushi restaurant, with patrons perched at a bar along the left. It was 9pm, maybe, so it wasn't jam-packed (yet). My coworker and I sat at the sushi bar, ordering rolls one-at-a-time over a single, cheapie bottle of Nigori sake. Each roll was delicious, and--somewhat to our surprise--the goofy music had seemed to attract a hipster clientele, although many of the folks there were just foodies. We remembered it as a pleasant evening, and raved about it the next day at work.\n\nNow we always go back there together, and I've also taken coworkers there to celebrate. It's just pricey enough to be tasty, but cheap enough for this wage-earner to take her friends out. Everyone says the same thing: \"That was pretty good!\" When I'm with company, I've also come to rely a bit on the appetizer menu--it's easy to find something for everyone. There are a few \"designer rolls,\" and while a couple are a little weird, they're basically delicious.\n\nHowever, I've discovered that the seating away from the bar is sort of sucky (except for the time I actually made reservations; that time, the table was less wobbly and near a wall). The Philadelphia roll manages to disappoint, even though I always warn my dining guests against it. Thank goodness there are two or three rolls that kick my ass every time--spider roll's definitely one--and the straight-up nigiri is really great. There's also a roll or two that is made with just a wee dab of mayo. Don't be scared! Those rolls are the best! The Tiger roll might be my fave.\n\nEdit, a year and a half later: Now that I am a dining expert, I am bumping up my Ryoko's review to a full five stars. I have since taken advantage of the 2am closing hour; I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar; if you go with vegetarian and vegan friends, steer them toward the Jumping Veggie rolls, which are even better (!!) than the Jumping Tuna rolls; the cheap, cheap Nigori sake will delight both hardened sake aficionados and sake newbs alike; the atmosphere is at its best when the music is awful; the peanut-butter-and-jalapeno-and-tempura-shrimp rolls are nice to share but don't make a meal on them; the cute sushi chef with a ponytail is my favorite. The bad: when you're wrapping up your meal, Ryoko's will ignore you and never bring your check, unless it almost 2am. I am convinced that they are trying to get you hungry again, so that you order one last sushi roll (it works).", "author": "Jenn X."}

She suggested we just ask the bartender at the bar we were at. What a novel idea!! I got the beauty she got the brains. Hopefully she never reads this review too. \nAnyway. We had a hard time finding the joint and when we finally stumbled upon it we were reluctant to go in. Looks like a sushi bat cave from the outside. We were immediately greeted by the staff and were lucky enough to get a seat right away. We got there early (around 7) and by the time we got our first drink there was a congregation waiting for the few tables that are here. The sushi is great. Fresh and inventive and the atmosphere is funky and fun. From the DJ pumping out techno to the owner buying everyone beer this place has it all.

Not only does this place close late, it carries authentic small dishes/rolls and has fresh fish.  Just note that the later you go--the slower the service (only 2 servers were available for the entire restaurant at around 1:30am) so if you're the kind of person who gets grumpy when hungry--keep walking! \n\nSome may not like the decor (the inside looks like the place was a former cheesy karaoke bar) but you easily bypass this small factor when you realize there's probably no other sushi bar in SF that can carry it off with rave reviews.  I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because of their prices: some rolls are worth the value, but others are surprisingly steep.  You can say you were cautioned now.  =)", "author": "Valerie F."}

I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a line 10 minutes before opening time: a good sign for a restaurant. \n\nThe ambience in this subterranean dining establishment was very cool. A mix of Japanese art and whiskey ads gave off a unique vibe.. quite different from many sushi restaurant i've been to, where they tend to keep decor on the traditional side. The soft hallogen glow of the sushi bar lamps and the (Christmas lights?) that wrapped around its wooden beams were a nice decorative touch; in my opinion, it seems like a good place to take a date. The low ceiling and a bit cramped interior may be an inconvenience during busier times, but is cozy. Onto the food.\n\nThe four of us got the following. \n\nSakepper roll: Capers, shiso leaf, and salmon. My friend said it was an interesting mix, and he liked that the capers added a unique saltiness to the roll.\n\nSpicy scallop roll: scallops, shiso leaf, and cucumber. I thought it was quite good, and very fresh. The scallops were not too spicy which is great because the taste of it wasn't masked. The shiso leaf adds a great refreshing note to the roll. \n\n49er roll: The cuts of fish were very generous. If you want something simple, go for this since it's just salmon and tuna on top with a basic CA roll underneath. \n\nUni (sea urchin) nigiri: This was awesome. I recently found out that there are 3 grades of Uni and this uni was excellent. Bright yellow and buttery with a slight taste of the ocean.. what a good uni should be. \n\nSalmon toro (Salmon belly) nigiri; This was the star of the night. My good friend got this, and his orgasmic reaction to taking a bite of it convinced the rest of us to order our own as well. He wasn't kidding. I wish i had a whole slab of salmon toro in front of me. They torched the skin slightly so you get just a hint of that richer salmon taste you get from cooked salmon. The rest of it melts in your mouth, but is substantial enough that you get to taste the salmon before it slides down to your already satisfied belly. \n\nhamachi nigiri: Nothing exceptional but very good since it was fresh.\nikura: My other two friends shared this and they both really like it. They mentioned a slight smoky flavor to it so maybe it's house smoked? Either way didn't know too much about this but if they say it was good, i trust them.\n\nService was friendly and fairly quick. I would say once the restaurant became packed it slowed down a bit, but it's understandable. In saying this however, they might do better with one more sushi chef. \n\n\nIn an area full of Japanese restaurants, this is a great option. If you are out shopping along Powell or in Union Square, take the short walk over to Ryokos because it'll be worth it. In a city known for Japanese restaurants, this one stands out among the best I've tried.", "author": "Jim Y."}

When I was here yesterday they played the widely known Rick Roll'd song from YouTube, followed by the song from the Venus razor commercials. I loved it.\n\n\nAs much as I love the environment, I love the food. Their deep-fried rolls are seriously amazing. The jumping tuna and jumping california are incredible, priced extremely reasonably at $7.50 per roll, and are served with a delectable sweet dipping sauce. I fell in love with them the first time I had them.\n\nThis is purely a personal preference, but I don't like the mint leaves they put into some of their rolls. I had the hot tuna roll last time, and I wasn't completely satisfied only because of the taste of the mint leaves. Everything else about them was very tasty.\n\nGood sake. Good miso soup.

Even though the sushi was great, the service left us with a bad taste in our mouth. \n\nWhen you enter, you have to put your name on the list and then stand awkwardly on the stairwell in front of the door, waiting for the hostess to call your name. We didn't have to wait that long, so that was good. \n\nWe were both incredibly thirsty. My husband ordered a diet coke and I ordered the iced tea and a water. For dinner, we ordered two Miso soups, the tempura, Pokemon roll, and Golden Gate roll. She brought us our drinks right away, but I never got my water. The rolls came out before the Miso, which was odd. When she set down the rolls, she didn't notice my empty tea glass. I thought I'd ask her for a refill when she came to see how our dinner was, but she never did check in. Instead, I had to flag down the hostess and ask her for a refill. I saw her ask the bartender for the tea and then she walked away. For the next ten minutes, the tea sat on the bar, totally ignored. I finally walked up myself and said the tea was for me and could I just take it. I guess word got back to our server, b/c shortly afterwards, she came to our table and asked my husband if he wanted some more diet coke, which he did. \n\nThe rolls were good. You can tell the sushi is a good grade. \n\nWhen we got the bill, we were surprised to see $8 worth of beverages. Apparently, they charged us for the two refills. I personally think that waitresses should tell you when there is a refill charge. \n\nTo make matters worse, they took forever to bring our check to the table, even with my husband holding his credit card in his hand as a signal.\n\nSo, good food and a neat atmosphere, but the service just made it not a place I'd want to re-visit.", "author": "Ambs W."}

This may be an issue to some people or if I was eating here with family but it was perfect for date night.\n\nBoyfriend and I were shopping at Westfield for work uniform for me on our 5th month and the day before his birthday. We agreed to eat sushi for our celebratory dinner so we yelped up this place and started walking there. This could be a walk for some people and it's uphill for some part so keep that in mind if you're planning to take Bart to Powell and walk up. It's fine if you've had to go around on public trans and on footmobiles for the majority of your life.\n\nInside, the place is very dim with a full bar and TV's going. SFG game was on so score! We were seated right away (Friday night btw) near to a staircase so I'm guessing there's an upstairs part of the restaurant? Someone correct me if I'm wrong. We ordered a bowl of miso soup, chicken teriyaki, a bowl of rice, shrimp and veg tempura, a dragon roll, and a 49ers roll. Sucks that the chicken teriyaki didn't already come with rice and there was no offer for it to come together  \"/ which is a sore spot for us; $1.50 extra for the bowl of rice. The chicken teriyaki and the shrimp tempura were good but the rolls easily were the highlight of the meal. Waitress was nice and didn't bother us that much which I liked. I don't like stressing out while I'm trying to eat and a waitress is trying to push us out. Took a while for us to get our bill but that wasn't too bad of an issue since we weren't trying to go anywhere soon. Total was around $52 for the two of us before tip.\n\nOverall, before going inside be prepared to be cut off from the rest of the world.

Ryokos is seriously the reason that I got Yelp!  I want to share with others the joy I get from this gem of a restaurant.  I recommend people to go to Ryokos nonstop because it is fantastic. \nI'm lucky enough I live up the street and go all the time.  Sometimes multiple nights in a row! \nHere are some reasons why:\n1.  The sushi itself is exceptional.  Always so fresh & perfectly prepared. Big, diverse menu & daily specials.  The fish is delicious, the marinades and sauces are always spot on. The sushi ranges from simple classics to more complex/ interesting & all are very flavorful. So satisfying!  Quality ingredients and you can taste the difference.  The Tahoe roll is my absolute favorite (tuna, avocado, rice, seaweed, fish roe). In my opinion, the perfect roll.  The chefs know my order by now :)\n2.  Always provide edamame on the house! How nice is that?  It's yummy too. Perfectly salted. And they also provide hand wipes- if they aren't in front of you when you sit just ask for some. \n3.  The presentation of the food is lovely. The chefs take real pride in their art & it shows. Wood blocks for the sushi, nice china soy sauce dispensers & saucers, etc. \n4.  The staff and customer service. Excellent excellent excellent.  I love sitting at the bar so I can watch the chefs work their magic. They are friendly & will answer any questions you have.  They are seriously very cool guys.  The waitstaff is incredibly accommodating, quick to serve, & also extremely friendly.  Chefs, waiters, runners, bussers-- always smiling.  I have gotten to know the owners daughter, who is an absolute sweetheart.  She is often working there, ensuring everyone is totally cared for.  She does an excellent job!  Ryokos is a family owned and operated business and the warmth and genuine care for customers reflects this. \n5.  Every single patron is cheerily, verbally welcomed (in Japanese) upon entering the restaurant  and thanked when they leave!  Makes you feel good about giving them your business. \n6. They have a full bar.  Awesome.  \n7. The environment!  The outside is rather simple, yet you walk downstairs and you just feel relaxed & like you've entered a fun, happy world of sushi!  Its cozy and cool at the same time.  There is nice low lighting, great array of multiple sized tables, bar seating, back room area. A DJ even plays on Fridays and Saturday's!  Upbeat/ chill music always throughout the week.  An absolute perfect date spot! Or place to dine alone at the bar (plenty do, including myself most often!) Or come with a small group of friends to eat & drink. I've enjoyed Ryokos in all these ways & every experience is perfect. \n8. They are open until 2am! Amazing.  SF needs more real restaurants open late. \n\nRyokos, I love you! You make San Francisco a better place.", "author": "AR S."}

Not that there's not better sushi, but there's definitely not nicer people, friendlier owners, sexier chefs, better music or later hours.  I've never been when it was 1 in the morning, but I hear stories.\n\nThe sushi is the bomb, but you must, MUST order omokase.  Another tip to those going for the first time is to sit at the bar if possible.  This is true for most sushi restaraunts, but as a regular here, I notice even I don't get the same service if sitting at a table.  The complicated fancy pants rolls are awesome, but there's nothing on the menu that compares to the fresh fish made how the chef feels necessary.  The only thing I ever order from the menu is the Jumping Unagi.  HOLY CRAP!\n\nAtsushi the chef is to die for gorgeous and rocks my roll.  Yoshi makes the best food. Everyone there is so polite.  Adorable hostess.  \n\nThis isn't a place to go if you're in a hurry.  That's usually the point of sushi.  Takes a while, which gives you time to drink up some nigori and chat with the chefs.  \n\nBestill my raw beating heart.\n\nOH! And once I had cod testicles there.  They were good.", "author": "Erin D."}

They have been pretty disappointed about Japanese food in the city, but they were really happy at Ryoko's. \n\nThe restaurant is little dark to see the menu at times, but the all the staff who helped my table at both occasions were really nice and helpful. The DJ who was spinning was also helpful the second time I went as it was a really busy night. He asked the waiter to come and ask an order when the restaurant got really busy. The music was little too funky for my parents age, but my parents were really satisfied because of the food.\n\nFirst of all, not many Japanese restaurants have good hot tea to start with. All of us were really pleased to start a meal with a nice hot tea followed by a good miso soup. Some other dishes my parents particularly liked were agedashi tofu, edamame, miso soup, and wakame-su. We were not so thrilled about the uni, but over all our experience there was great.\n\nIt is a popular spot, so if you go on a busy night, like Friday or Saturday, it might be a good idea to make a reservation ^^", "author": "Sayaha A."}

Then they offered us soggy tempura shitake(not a misspelling) mushrooms, a martini glass filled to the top with ponzu with great octopus but couldn't enjoy it because of how much they drowned it in the ponzu.  Then they gave us chicken skewers that were mushy and we completely had enough.  Chef's pick!?

Dance music is played all the time at a volume that makes normal conversation slightly inconvenient.

This is not the place if you want nice nigiri sushi or chirashi. Don't bother to order the deluxe chirashi. At it's $30 price tag, I expect something more than a few slices of Maguro, sake, saba, tamago, unagi on rice flooded with ikura. The tofu in the miso soup tasted sour and the rice ball (onigiri) is nothing special. On the other hand, if you are with people who love Americanized sushi rolls late at night, I guess this is the place to be. \n\nI have to agree the atmosphere is great for social gathering.

So I ate the uni. And I ate my boyfriend's too. \"What do you mean it tastes funny? If you won't eat it, I will!\"\n\nAn hour later, at some bar whose name I never did catch, the uni struck back. In it's determination to reach the sea via the sewage ducts of San Francisco, I spent 3 hours in the bathroom, clutching my middle and whimpering.\n\nMoral of the story: the fresh seafood at Ryoko's is a hit or miss. I'll still go back because their back room is a fantastic place to hang out with a group of people before going out hard. But it's much safer to stick to all things American: dragon rolls, spicy this or that roll, something called the Sexy roll that comes with melted cheese on it...you know, American sushi. \n\nOh and make reservations.

My other gf, who isnt into fish and ordered the chicken teriyaki also thought her dish was great as well.\n\nAll in all, great times were had thanks to a festive atmosphere, perfect seating, and wonderful food.\n\n(Minus one star because there is only 1 teeny-tiny stall for the ladies room.)", "author": "Ebiru S."}

Pretty good for being sushi + peanut butter. I also ordered a salmon nigiri but the salmon wasn't very fresh and very small. \n\nThe ambiance of this place was nice and seemed fun and hip.

It's in the TL just a couple blocks from the Square (which we walked from) so we knew it would likely be an interesting place. It was packed so I was confident we'd be happy with our meal. Unfortunately once we sat (on pillow stools - almost like an ottomon), it took a while for our server to get to us. We knew what we wanted when she asked what we wanted to drink yet refused to take our order until she came back - 10 minutes later. The two of us shared 5 rolls but only one was memorable - it had mango and salmon. Awful service as I had to stop someone three times to get refills on my water (their spicy rolls are SPICY). Despite my craving for sushi, I should have walked down to Blondie's Pizza for a slice-o-pep.", "author": "Erin L."}

You basically duck under some low-hanging Japanese banners and walk down a staircase. Once you're at the bottom things come alive. We went there on a Monday night and the place was hopping. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Once seated you're bombarded  by different sake handouts and menus. After deciding that reading all of these descriptions was just too much after a long day at work, I opted for the plain hot sake. Nothing special about it but a large bottle is $7, which is a pretty good price.  The food menu is pretty extensive with a lot of Japanese cuisine options, even for those crazy people who don't like sushi. The sushi selection is pretty good, with one full page for nigiri/sashimi selections, one for standard maki rolls and one for specialty maki rolls. They automatically give you an order of edamame on the house when you sit down. We ordered the miso soup, which was nothing out of the ordinary. We also ordered a house salad to split. Usually house salads are served in the same small bowl size as miso soup but this one was gigantic, a great deal for $5. The table next two us had the gyoza, which smelled delicious so we got an order of that. It comes with this spicy dipping sauce instead of the standard soy, which was a nice change. For sushi, we for the spice scallop which was listed as a standard roll when a lot of places charge premium prices. And it wasn't a weak spice, it was actually so spicy that the friend I was with couldn't eat it (which means more for me!). We also ordered the rainbow roll, which is a choice you can't really go wrong with as long as the fish quality is up to snuff. I would definitely recommend checking out Ryokos if you want good sushi near Union Square (although my favorite will always be Sushi Toni).", "author": "Larisa J."}

Not really a big fan of fish either!! \n\nSo why did I end up going out to this restaurant? \n\nWell, my wife and friends have been bugging me to try sushi for ages and I finally agreed to give it a try. If I didn't like it, there is always a McDonald's on the way home right? \n\nWell, I have to say this place is great! People were waiting on the sidewalk to get a table (which was a good sign) and it had a real club feel to it with a house DJ spinning tunes while you ate. It is a small place, low lighting and the tables were packed tightly together and the place has a really cool buzz to it. \n\nThey serve a mixture of hot and cold food. The sushi rolls are great, lots of choice. Definitely reccommend the Volcano Rolls. Peanut butter with tempura shrimp and jalapeno peppers! Everything we ordered was edible (don't forget this was my first time!) and they have a full bar too. Beer by the pitcher, sake by the bottle. No complaints there and the price was reasonable enough. \n\nRyokos had a great atmosphere and a cool place to spend the evening with friends.

Even at that time, there were still 20 people ahead of us, so there's usually a bit of a wait.  \n\nOnce you go downstairs, you'll find a dimly lit restaurant which felt more like a bar than a restaurant.  I'm sure it's catered more for the late night crowd since there's even a live DJ.  \n\nI've been to Ryoko's several times, but this was the first time I sat in the back room which had a very low table with square ottomans as seats.  I have to say the seating arrangement was rather uncomfortable.  I would've have preferred the regular seating.  \n\nNow on to the food.  My friends ordered a bunch of cooked rolls (yeah, I know) and agedashi tofu.  I had the chirashi since I wanted my raw fish fix.   Presentation wise, it looked nice, but I have to say the sashimi in the chirashi was just above average.  At the price, you would either expect higher quality or bigger portions, but for me, I would've preferred better quality.\n\nRyoko's is a perfect late night dining spot if you don't want to go with the standard greasy late night eats.  If you just want Japanese during regular dinner hours, there are probably better options in the city.  I give it 4 stars just because the food is decent and it opens late.", "author": "David T."}

I know they may taste okay, but people trust me you're eating crap and paying dearly in many cases.\n\nNot here. Ryoko's a breath of fresh ocean air. The fish is always fresh and the chef who's direct from Tokyo always strives to have seasonable specials on hand to keep regulars happy.

I go there on dates to set an intimate mood and with large groups of friends to get stewey; the environment suits both. \nWe kicked off my 21st birthday there 2 years ago and it was great.  \n\nThe steep stairs,  dim lights, blue walls and subtle jazz theme are unique and set Ryoko's ambiance apart from any other sushi spot that I know of.  The grand piano in the middle of the room hardly gets used, unless the DJ is set up atop it or I'm drunk enough to bust out with some \"Night in Tunisia\" or \"Cantaloupe Island.\"\n\nThe Food is phenomenal.  The fish is always the freshest, and the sushi is always prepared and presented beautifully.  The tuna melts on your tongue like butter.  There are things that you can order that are not on the menu, just ask the waitresses if there are any \"secret\" rolls or dishes.  A great example is the flash fried tuna jalapeno roll.  Unbelievable.  They also have an amazing selection of Saki and other beverages; their bar is fully stocked.  \n\nThe service is awesome.  The worst is on busy nights, you can expect to wait up to 25 min for all of your rolls if you are in a large group, but i have never waited longer, and on average the food usually arrives in no longer than 15 min.  The waiters and waitresses are always friendly, knowledgeable and are never far, as the place is so small.  \n\nAside from the fact that it sometimes gets really hot in their, I can't find a thing about Ryoko's, or any other sushi spot in SF that would make me stop being a regular.

Ryoko was the top choice for us and seeing the amazing reviews, we had to try it out. We got there around peak dinner time (around 8pm) and didn't even have to wait more than 10-15 minutes. (Not bad for a really good sushi spot if you're willing to sit at the bar.) Their prices were a bit steeper than your average sushi restaurants for the dinner meals, but if you're sticking to rolls and sashimi for your dinner, then it's not too bad.

But the music isn't suitable (enjoyable in other environments), and unless you are lucky enough to get a table by a wall, you are too close to other people's tables, and lord help you if you are sitting next to the loudest talker in the place (unfortunately it did happen to me...)\n\nI also got a crappy table crammed next to the piano as well the second time I went.\n\nNext time I'm going, it's sitting at the bar.

I used to live three/four blocks from this place and it had an effect on my bank account!\n\nThe first time I went there...I went too early.\n\nThe owners were there, preparing catering orders.  They were very polite and even gave me two free orders of sushi.  They are so nice and cool.  I see them almost every time I'm in there. \n\nThe hours are great, open late!  You often see other service industry people in there.  \n\nMy favorites:  the jumping unagi, the volcano roll, the pokemon, the california roll (which is great for those who have friends that don't like to experiment with sushi because it's the best CA roll ever.)  all with a big glass of plum wine! :D  Also, don't expect lip-glued-to-butt-cheek service here.  If you want something, you'll have to wave someone down for it!  If you're alone, pay attention to the credit card usage restrictions that are posted at the bar.  Great music too.", "author": "Cat A."}

My friend who recommended the place raved about how great and quirky it was, and talked about an Elvis-like owner who played the piano (still waiting to see this person). Regardless, I remained ho-hum. It wasn't like it was terrible, it was just that I was expecting a lot more.\n\nMy second trip, 3 years later, was surprisingly good. This time, I spent time sifting through the very original and unique menu, and trying all the interesting things you can't find at a run-of-the-mill sushi joint. One roll in particular had peanut butter--weird but well-balanced in a way I would not have expected. We tried all the specials and were impressed (and often surprised), by what came out.\n\nMy third visit--on a Friday night at 10pm--was excrutiating. I expected that it would be busier, and that we would have to wait, but from getting seated (this in itself was an ordeal), to getting our food, I estimate we were there almost 2 hrs before finally eating our appetizers. If you are wanting a clubby atmosphere with tons of loud, drunk, overly skanky, and obnoxious people, then seems like this is the best time to visit.\n\nIt is a seemingly hole-in-the wall place, hidden in the basement off a busy street, but inside, the atmosphere reminds me of what you'd expect to find at a locals only NYC restaurant. The best thing about this place is that it feels authentic--from the fresh food, to the 1970s jazz bar decor, to the people. But best of all--it's open LATE--like until 2am--which is when I suggest going--except on a weeknight when you are most likely to enjoy your meal.", "author": "Sabine S."}

They cook it just right so it's crispy hot on the outside but the fish is still raw and serve it with a sweet and sour sauce that's just the right balance. You won't want to share it, get one each.

We were told that the wait would be about 30-40 minutes...TWO hours later we were finally seated at the bar. Our order of edamame came quickly enough, but it was just smothered in salt. I love salt, but even for me the amount of salt on there was a little overkill. I ordered a simple vegetable roll and an order of inari. Despite my order being the simplest, it came out way after my friend's food. The rice in my food was way too vinegary, and it left the most unpleasant taste in my mouth that lingered long after I left the restaurant. I am Japanese, and the one thing I can not stand in a Japanese restaurant is when they can't even do rice properly. Rice is the backbone of Japanese food; I ate rice at every meal growing up. Rice is the simplest thing to make, so to mess up rice so tremendously is appalling. On top of the bad food was the bad club music playing loudly and the fact that I was constantly getting bumped by people walking by. We also had to ask for a refill for our water, which is my friend's biggest pet peeve. At a good restaurant, your water glass should automatically get refilled without asking (I have never had to ask for water at Sakana). I was going to originally give this restaurant two stars since the service wasn't good, but it wasn't awful; until I found out that when my friend mentioned the wait time to the hostess, instead of apologizing to him, she told him that he should know better since it was a weekend! My past experiences here have always been mediocre, but this time it just pushed me over the edge, and the fact that my stomach is still uneasy from the food isn't helping. So thank you Ryoko's for reminding me why I never come here and why I should always eat at Sakana right down the street instead. Seriously, go to Sakana where they have the best server in the city, the food is cheap and very good, and the atmosphere is pleasant.", "author": "Melissa A."}

One of  our appetizers was forgotten, it took 30 minutes to order, and maybe another 30 before getting any food. Prices were odd, some rolls were cheap while others were over-priced (Spider Roll is $18). The place is a dive, my chair actually broke during dinner and I had to sit crooked. They had a live DJ spinning, setup on the top of a grand piano. The boy had bad house and 80s going at an ear splitting level. The sushi itself was odd, the ingredients were of high quality but the preparation/presentation was strange. Rolls had the fish laid on top, also the cuts weren't very skillful, i.e. clean.

Maybe I was a flapper in a past life.\nThe front entrance feels like a speakeasy that could possibly had a gorilla protecting the front door during the DRY Prohibition days,\nBut when you make it down the stairs, you are transported to Japan and oh boy! Ipai! The Kirin and Sapporo runs freely. This is definitely a WET bar. There is a large bar that greets you and the seating is interesting, like my favorite seat is the Mob Boss seat which is in the middle and next to the wall. A good place for an intimate meeting, eating some great sushi rolls of varying flavors, intensities, textures for the epicuriously inclined, with tea, beer, or whatever else your fruity heart desires. My favorites are the tempura shrimp rolls, a good size portion of edamame. The one think I'd skip is their gyoza. Everything else is open season. The waiters are pretty chill and the music is good. I'd say this is one of my favorite sushi joints. Ryoko is to go with friends you give a shhh about and want some place kind of different, speakeasy like, like it's a dirty little secret.

It was super hot, and the table was a coffee table and the stools are the same height as the table, it made me want to sit on the floor. I'm alright with chopsticks so it wasn't a real big deal for me but a couple of my friends were using plates under their chopsticks in case they dropped the sushi on the long trip to their mouth. It was fun but I would prefer cusions on the floor or a normal table. I also felt it was a bit dark, I couldn't really see my food. We had the 49er, golden gate, and spicy tuna. Our favorite was the 49er. The fish is good quality. I wanted to give this place a 3.5 but no half marks so 3 it is because of comfort and service wasn't that great, fairly slow. We ordered mochi at the end and it was stale, when we told them they looked at us like we were crazy, we had to ask the waitress to try one. They wouldn't take the mochi off the bill instead brought us a different flavour that wasn't stale. We also had the imported unfiltered cold sake, very good!

The DJ is intense and good.  Staff has been quite friendly.  The rolls are kind of boring and tend to the non-fraw fish.  Nigiri, though limited on the regular stuff, always has a intriguing list of specials - all the way from fresh octopus to otoro for $18.  There are quite a few appetizer dishes that are not exactly comfort food but are not the common sushi bar fare either - four kinds of korokke, a rice and dashi soup, tuna natto, fried smelts, a very nice tako wakame.  The sushi chefs actually assemble some of these even though they aren't sushi so you get a careful, fancy presentation.  Which actually makes them taste better.  That's what shines here, the appetizers.\n\n== Old review - 2 stars ==\n\nLate on a weeknight and the place felt it. . . this cramped basement hideaway had a rock star after-the-party vibe going, a nice turnout but not crowded. \n\nThere seemed to be a lot of politics going on behind the counter, sour looks from the waitstaff, not to mention serve-yourself drinking, gum chewing, and eating in front of patrons.  The sushi chef took a long time to do 2 pieces of nigiri and a hand roll, slow in the hand compared to what I'm used to seeing, and some slow talk with other diners.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy downtown neighborhood speakeasy.  A grand piano, some nooks, a staircase leading up to nowhere.  Dark, no windows.  People don't come here to love the fish, they come to eat it.   A noisy time with friends. All that would be forgivable, fine, perfect -- very New York -- if it all came together.

This used to be a charming, not-very-trafficked sushi joint.  In the last few months, the place is crawling with Marina yuppie scum who are taking a break from styling their hair or putting on a spaghetti strap top to go get sushi.  Granted, they have good taste, but the influx of Marina idiots has been disheartening to say the least.  Please Ryoko's, leave this trash at the door.\n\nI love this joint.  The food is above average, but the ambiance is pretty dope.  The service is sometimes spotty but the girls at the bar are usually friendly.  The rolls are mad creative:  shrimp tempura, roe, deep fried jalepeno and peanut butter.  Who puts peanut butter in a roll?  Maybe I'm a sushi novice, but I thought it was creative, and more importantly, it worked.  The nigiri is fantastic and always fresh.  The toro is a great great piece of fish.  \n\nBut, the ambiance is what makes this place great. It's an underground spot, with blue walls and a DJ.  It's very unassuming.  When I was single, I thought this place to be a great place to weed out a girl.  If she was into it, she would work for me.

I sat at the sushi bar and chatted with a friend. Service was informal, but very friendly and attentive -- the sushi chef asked me what I wanted and prepared it for me, and the tuna and the roe were both fresh and succulent. The green tea was rich and flavorful, and the green tea mochi dessert was much more complex and subtle than what I've had elsewhere. To sum it up, the food was great, but the cozy atmosphere and truly attentive service (while we sat and chatted for more than two hours) was special. This is not a flashy or elegant place, but very genuine.", "author": "Karen A."}

They welcomed us with open arms (yes at 1am) and the service was impeccable.   So much so we both agreed it was some of the best we have experienced! The sushi was also excellent and came out very fast.  We felt right a home and would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for great sushi and service in the union square area of SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-06-02", "description": "okay sooo.... if you are reading this I do not want you to think I did not like the food. The sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri are delicious and the green tea is strong-which I like. And the service is usually fast and good.\n\nI am writing this review because I have been here many times. Probably about 20 different times as it is one of the only places my girlfriend and I save our money to eat at-that is how much we used to love it. \n\nAfter last night though, I think it will be a while before we cool off enough to come here. So the night begins-it is 8 o'clock and busy-this is fine we expected that. We were seated quickly for the amount of people that were there. We have always sat in the front room and had great food and great service and we were excited to see that they were taking us to an open table in the middle room (not the way back-which is maybe a private party room?) which is more private and we always wanted to sit back there. \n\nOur waiter came quickly and took our drink order. He delivered our water, sprite, and miso relatively quickly and told us he would be back shortly to take our order. He then took a drink order from the table next to us and when he returned with their drinks we expected him to take our order. They told him they were ready to order-he took their order and proceeded to inform them it was going to be a very long wait for the food would they like more appetizers. A strong, powerful Columbian woman at the table next to us asked him why and said they did not want to wait for a very long time and it was not usual that they should (she had also been here several times). I unfortunately did not hear this conversation and my girlfriend told me later when we were discussing the wait. Instead of coming to us right away to take our order he put there order through and I practically had to wave him down just to take our dinner order. \n\nWe ordered flying tuna, 2 flying veggie, a volcano, and a 49er and all were delicious except they were ruined by the 45 minute - 1 hr wait -I did not have my watch or phone and neither did my girl-this was supposed to be a celebration night for us as we had just finished college with straight As and wanted to treat ourselves to something nice. I know it took a VERY LONG TIME TO GET OUR FOOD though because the table next to us that had ordered many more appetizers, drinks, and more rolls (but a few were the EXACT SAME ROLLS as our order), and beers, were completely finished with their food by the time ours came. \n\nI tried to trick the food into coming by using the restroom but it did not and on my way down from the restroom I saw a couple that had come in two parties after us who were also completely finished with their dinner BEFORE WE EVEN GOT OUR FOOD. At least bring some more edamame!! Do something! The waiter was so rude he barely acknowledged us and both my girlfriend and I stared him down at different times yet he still did not come to apologize for the wait or see if we needed something else. When I was in the bathroom my girl gave him such a dirty look that another waitress even tapped him and pointed her way, he waved it off and STILL did not even come to check in with us. I used to love this place and we have in the past been able to eat for about 45$ for both of us. \n\nLast night I walked in with 100$ since it was a particularly special occasion and had fully expected to leave a 20% tip because that is how good the service usually is, a smile on my face, and a hunger for some of the best sushi in town. I walked out after leaving literally a 5% tip and fuming. This is one of the only reviews I have ever written on yelp and that shows you how pissed I was and still am to have had a perfect night ruined by an asshole waiter. So to recap: we got there before the table next to us-they ordered before we did, they got their appetizers and their food and had completely finished eating before we got our food, a couple that had come in two slots behind us had also COMPLETELY finished their food before we got ours. I guess I should have also put up a fight with the waiter-but that just is not my personality. I usually try to give the staff the benefit of the doubt and hope for the best because I understand the stress of working in a restaurant. We walked in at 8, were seated by 8:20, ordered soup, salad, and 5 rolls and did not get out until 10:40---That is Wrong, especially when others are not being treated like that. What? was it because we are gay women? I mean this is San Francisco so you would not think there would be an issue but it seems like maybe this guy had a problem with us in particular. or else he was just lazy and does not want his job.  \n\nRyoko-it was the male waiter in the back rooms last night (wednesday June 1st) around 8-11-- I have had WAY BETTER service at a deli. He NEVER EVEN APOLOGIZED ONCE FOR THE WAIT.  This is supposed to be a restaurant and it is expensive enough that I should not have to wait an hour to get my food", "author": "julia n."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-24", "description": "A hotel manager recommended Ryoko's to me both for being delicious and being open long after every other restaurant shuts down around Union Square (they're open until 2am most nights).  I arrived around 11pm and found the place very lively and completely full.  I waited 15 minutes for a seat at the bar, and despite the large crowd the service was prompt, courteous, and unusually forthcoming.  The servers gladly answered all of my questions and did so honestly, especially those relating to health concerns (I am allergic to shellfish).\n\nAs a regular sushi eater limited by my allergy, I greatly appreciated the variety of Ryoko's menu.  I had miso soup, \"hot tuna\" hand roll, Spicy Golden Gate roll, and tamago, as well as a small bowl of edamame which they serve in lieu of a bread basket and iced oolong tea.  The soup came very hot and was a bit too savory for my taste, while the edamame could have benefited from a bit more salt.  By far the best item was the \"hot tuna,\" distinguishable from the traditional spicy tuna by the addition of shiso, a spicy and sharp Japanese herb.  It was absolutely genius- the best hand roll I have ever had both because of balance of flavors and quality of ingredients.  I believe it included both ahi and albacore tuna.  The Spicy Golden Gate roll contains salmon, shiso, cucumber, and flying fish roe.  All in all it was satisfactory, however it hardly seems to warrant \"spicy\" as a modifier.  On that note, however, the wasabi packed much more punch than I usually find in restaurants, which I very much appreciated.  Only a small bit was enough to make the Spicy Golden Gate roll deserve its name.  Something about the tamago was unusual but I couldn't figure out what it was.  I would definitely order it again, though, as I always end with it.\n\nPresentation was somewhat lacking and the rolls tended to fall apart quite easily, perhaps due to the large volume of rolls to be made, but Ryoko is less about the presentation of the food than the overall atmosphere.  The clientele ranges from teenagers to grandparents, even late at night, although the club-like decor, edgy style, and live DJ mixing techno beats seem to favor the 20 something crowd.  Drinking seemed to be the order of the evening for most guests, but plenty were there just to enjoy the incredibly fresh seafood and hip atmosphere.\n\nThe rolls are conveniently ordered by price on the menu, starting as low as $4 and maxing out at $20 (the most expensive rainbow roll I've ever seen).  The rolls get more interesting as they get more expensive, but most were priced comparably to other places I've been.  My total bill was the lowest I've ever had at a sushi place- $23 including tax, and I had more food than I could eat, although had I chosen different rolls it would have been a very different fiscal story.  By the time I was done eating, the place was almost empty (10 after midnight), but for some reason the servers became much less attentive and it took a very long time to get my check.\n\nI will definitely return for the hot tuna, the atmosphere, and the fun staff.  I don't think I can be satisfied with regular spicy tuna ever again.", "author": "Katrina R."}

So I got up and found here and said, \"Um, excuse me, my friend already got her meal, I've been waiting a long time and I haven't gotten mine yet\". She looked really surprised and looked around, \"I'm so sorry, I'll get it right out to you.\" She came back a few minutes later with my food and a new beer on the house. She appologized again and said that it was her restaurant and her name is Ryoko and she hopes we come back. Of course I appreciated the free beer and the waitress comping my meal as well but the whole ordeal took waaay longer than it should have been. I think the waitress just had her head up her butt that night. I'm sure this is normally a great place and that they are normally on top of it and \"head-in-ass\" free. But I'm reviewing based on my experience, and I just don't want to have to get up to chase down the waitress to ask where my food is and why its taking so long while my friend has already been served. It's silly. \"2 stars\". Next time try harder.", "author": "Mike S."}

Probably the best fried roll i've ever had was the spicy tuna. They used really large pieces of albacore and regular tuna and only lightly fried the outside.

Suffice it to say that we ordered three more pairs. The mackerel (aji) nigiri was likewise delectable and very fresh, although definitely stronger in flavor than the aburi. We also had a couple of rolls, but as many of the other reviewers caution, these are pretty standard (and a touch small)... it is truly the nigiri and sashimi that blows you out of the water. We topped it all off with a couple of Sapporo's and some green tea mochi dessert, and raved about the whole thing all the way home. \n\nAdd to that reasonable prices, the whimsical underground dive bar feel, and all-around friendly service, and you've got an amazing experience at Ryoko's.

You walk down a flight of stairs and enter into a sort of basement space with low ceilings and low lighting that's made even dimmer by the dark blue painted walls.  These elements to my mind make the place unique among the countless sushi bars I've eaten at in the San Francisco bay area.  Another plus is the fact that it remains open until 2am on week-ends, and features a dj.  I've sidled up the the sushi bar at midnight and had a simply grand time listening to beats and watching Atsushi the rockstar sushi chef slice up cold, raw slabs of hamachi many, many times.  He literally is a rock star, playing in a band called The Thunder at places like Rockit Room on Clement.\n     The Japanese food here is very good.  Keep in mind that I an individual who's been to Japan several times and who eats almost exclusively sashimi, that is, raw fish only.  The only items I get with rice is unagi, which has always been good here.  My standards are hamachi, hamachi kama, toro, salmon, ebi, makerel, sea urchin, blue fin, sea scallop, octopus, and just about anything on the board imported fresh from Japan.  Granted, one pays extra for these items.  For the quality and taste, one must.  Yes, if you wish to get filled up, if you're merely eating to fill the belly and satisfy your hunger, then eat rolls till you're satisfied.  If you're interested in experiencing eye-rolling tastes, flavors, and textures, go for what's raw and what's fresh.  \n     I ate some of the best fatty tuna I've ever had one night there awhile back when I tried virtually everything on the board.  I was there alone and decided to have Atsushi challenge my taste buds and serve me up whatever he wished or dared.  He didn't disappoint, and Ryoko has never really disappointed over the years I've been frequenting it.\n     Also very good here besided sashimi is the cooked foods, what's known as izakaya or country type cooking.

People who can actually tell the difference may notice a few basic things that won't change from night to night such as that they don't carry real crab or that their fresh wasabi isn't really fresh wasabi at all and tastes far worse than the standard wasabi that they serve you. Other than that, the quality of the fish itself seemed fine but ranged from not properly prepared (unagi had almost no eel sauce) to not properly stored or handled giving the fish a fishy smell and taste. Service gets 5 stars just for serving sushi till 2AM and minus 2 stars for allowing me to eat something off the menu.", "author": "Michael G."}

This is the place you've been looking for. Underground Sushi bar in Tenderloin district. A bit dark with a constant beat of techno music. Expectedly crowded at 930 pm on a Friday night, but the wait was less than 15 minutes. The food was excellent. We sat at the bar and ordered the usual rolls and nigiri sushi. We also got recommendations from the chef's (a highly recommended way to order sushi if you are somewhat of a novice). Nice selection of sake. We tried a couple of dessert recommendations which did not disappoint. After dinner, we hit a couple of local bars.

I've always noticed it on the way up and they have a red lantern outside and you can't help but look through the glass doors to see the stools at the sushi bar taken up and people drinking and eating something delicious.  You go down the stairs right into the restaurant of royal blue walls and there's a baby grand piano in the middle of the place. Sweet.\n\nIt was a warm night and perfect for sushi and sake.  I think Ryoko's place is an izakaya with it's own San Francisco twist! (Royal blue walls, grand piano.) Pretty lively for a Monday!  We sat down and ordered drinks - sake, beer for the three of us and a chu-hai (sho-chu) with peach tea for me.  (I'm such a chick.)  Ryoko's has quite a variety of cooked dishes, rolls and the more traditional sushi and sashimi.  The chicken kara-age (fried chicken) and beef tataki were really good.  I love me Japanese fried chicken!  The nikujaga (beef and potatoes)  was tasty with large potato quarters and beef, but I would have liked something a little more hearty than brothy as they prepared it here.  We also had omakase sashimi (chef's choice) which included kanpachi, akadai (red snapper), mirugai (geoduck or giant clam), sake (salmon), white mackerel and tobiho (flying fish) which was the very first time I've ever tried it. The sashimi was nicely presented, but the pieces of fish were a little small. In the end with everything else rolling around in our bellies, we were just right.   We also had hotate (scallop) nigiri and uni (sea urchin) nigiri. The uni was fresh, creamy and sweet. \n \nThe last time I was here, it was about $50 a person.  I would say they are fairly reasonable since I've been eating basically the \"top shelf\" of their sashimi and sushi each time I've been here.  They have interesting sashimi here to try, as even our Japanese companion commented that flying fish is very rare to find in Japan.  Next time, I think I will order on my own instead of omakase because I did miss my hamachi and shiro-maguro (albacore).

A grand piano sits opposite the bar in a cozy but trendy basement space; presumeably the baby grand is home to a pianist or DJ later at night on weekends, but I've never seen one during the main dinner crowd.  The sashimi is not the greatest in the city, but it is some of the better stuff around Union Square, and the long, inventive roll list should satisfy those looking for less authentic Japanese fare.  The staff is quite polite and the charismatic owner/manager often makes rounds to check up on her customers.", "author": "MScott S."}

Sushi was of good quality but nothing to write home about really. Where Ryoko earned their stars for me was in their service. Because the place was pretty packed when I was there it took a second to get my order out, but they made sure I had some edamame to munch on and would refill my miso soup when I finished it, which I thought was dope.

With each bite it just melted in our mouths.  We shared the salmon nigiri and I had the 'sexy' roll that had cheese, salmon, crab, and avocado.  My husband's philly roll was also very tasty.

How something that small could be packed with so much flavor is beyond me.  I ordered another roll too based on the waitress' recommendation.  I didn't like it, it had plum in it that sounded interested, but I think it was just me not liking the flavor.  I'm sure other people with different tastes would have liked it.  The 3 friends I was with ordered a lot of food, i tried their seaweed salad, which was amazing.  I'm not sure if the place is terribly expensive or my friends just ate a lot, but it came to $50 a person.

Slow slow slow, and after waiting 10 minutes between dishes and asking nicely of the whereabouts....suddenly there was a shout over my shoulder.  i looked, my server was scurrying away...and my dish was sitting off to my right, somewhat closer to the diner 2 stools over.  Was it his?  Was it mine?  If it was mine, why not put it to my left between me and my dining partner?  It was mine.  After waiting too long for dessert, we said please forget it and we'll take the check.  Of course, the dessert was on the check -- more drama to get it removed.

I would highly suggest not going in a group of more than three people. The number of medium and large tables is severely limited. Our group of four arrived at 7PM for dinner and put our name on the list with only 2 other smaller parties ahead of us. Every few minutes, the greeter / waiter would tell us that it would only be a few more minutes before our table was ready. This continued for an hour at which time a table for us was being made available. At around that time, another party of four comes in and states that they had a reservation. Whether this was the truth or they were more keen on what went on at the restaurant, I cannot say. We waited for another hour, all the while parties of two were getting seated before us.\n\nWe ended up waiting 2 hours and leaving to go eat at the Japanese restaurant down the street.

Not a good idea, maybe we just went on a bad day. We wanted to sit by the TV because there was a Warrior game coming up, little did we know we were sitting by the back door that kept on opening! It was freezing in there! We told the waiter about it, he closed it but for some reason it kept opening every 5 min!. We couldn't enjoy our food or the game, so we left. I have been to amazing sushi places and this one just didn't do it for me, I don't think I'll be visiting this sushi place again.", "author": "Alma C."}

On a Saturday night, best to make a reservation or you'll be waiting for well over 1 hour.  Luckily, my sister's boyfriend got a reservation for 4 at 8:30pm.  Although, we drove around for 20+ minutes looking for parking, we made it to the restaurant before they got mad about the reservation (although half the party was there arleady)  They play loud techno music on the weekends, so it kind of attracts a hippie/punky crowd.  But the atmosphere is casual.  We ordered a bunch of rolls to share include the umeshiso,hot tuna, jumping eal, golden gate, volcano, checkerboard and dragon roll.  I have to say the added shiso leaf to teh hot tuna made it taste quite unique.  The fish on the chekcerboard was also really really fresh, metls in your mouth!  The rest of the rolls were ok, most of them were rolled very loosely so they kind of fall apart really easily but  All the rolls tasted super fresh.  The portions were't that large, six small-ish pieces per roll.  After that, we decided hat wasn't enough for the 4 of us so we ordered some chicken kaaraage and fried octopus and a onigiri (fried rice ball).  These items didn't really wow me or anything.  The chicken didn't taste like a traditional chicken kaarage and the fried baby octopus was really just too chewy.. i chewed for like 5 minutes on tha thing!  The fried rice ball was ok but it only came with 1  .. kinda of pricey for that. Also got 3 beers and the bill came to $125 including tax and tip.  The wait-staff are pretty responsive since its a tiny restaurant.  The only things I would really complain about is the noise level, stuffiness and small portions.  Otherwise, the fish is really fresh!", "author": "Margie C."}

Bathrooms were nice and clean (i'm only vouching for the men's though).  My only complaint was the food.  A friend ordered a plate of teriyaki chicken for an appetizer that we all shared, and that was delicious, but when our sushi came out it was warm and the flavors were too subtle for my taste.  The ingredients tasted like they had been sitting out for a while...and in a sushi restaurant, that's a bit unsettling.

Not apologetic at all and I stress that the place was not crowded. No one in there seemed to be eating though so we're all waiting for food!? I got the jumping tuna. Gross too much tempura and bland.

Miss: You climb down some Hobit-unfriendly stairs to a cellar and you feel like you're in a a comfy den of late night thieves. The sushi chefs are friendly.... if they know you. Waitresses busy, and sometimes forget your order. There's no on-da-house here, you walk out after a couple of Sakis paying through your nasal cavities. Saturdays a dj cranks the hip-hop at club level; \"This ain't Ruby Sky Dude.\"   Hit: Wednesday or Thursday night. Sushi's fresh. Chef's talkative while slicing.  Interesting and unique dishes pop up here and there. The after hours restaurant working crowd likes to come here and mix with the Academy of \"Arteests\" for some late night grub. Good mellow people watching. The food comes fast at the table, but better to sit at the bar. If you're lucky Yosh might sing some Sinatra.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2005-08-18", "description": "I am perplexed by the bad sushi reviews.  Ryoko's is one of the best sushi places that I've ever been to.  Yes - their prices are expensive.  My boyfriend and I walk out of there every Friday night for what amounts to a payment on a compact-sized Honda - but it is an experience unparalled by most sushi joints.  Atsushi, one of the sushi chefs, is very friendly, young and hip.  Most importantly, he makes amazing freestyle dishes.  If you're lucky enough to get a bar seat, ask him to make you something of his choice, but be aware that he will use ingredients that you may never have seen or tasted before.  I think people who have given bad reviews are simply getting California rolls and thinking that this is a good way to go.  I recommend the specials on the board above the bar.  When they have it, get the:  octopus, bluefin tuna, Spanish mackerel (the only mackerel I can eat; this fish is uncured and not fishy tasting), yellow tail... it is all amazing.  As for rolls, the jumping unagi is a deep-fried eel with avocado and sweet dipping sauce delight.  The D.J.s are great and friendly, although often the music reaches volumes not condusive to small venues, and are told to bring it down a notch.  All in all, between the music, the atmosphere and the taste of bluefin melting my mouth, I'd rather be at Ryoko than anywhere else.  It's where my boyfriend and I went on our first date and we've been there almost every Friday night since.  Just don't take our 2 seats by the door.", "author": "Shelley T."}

Wanna make sumthin of it? Its little, its not filling, its expensive and soy sauce and wasabi are the most grody flavors ever. Yeah I even said \"grody\".   Why would you take mild flavors that are as delicate as they are subtle and pour two pungent, overpowering, rancid, acid reflux inducing chemicals like those over the top?!  It makes no fucking sense. Who the hell back in the day decided that that was the way to go. I can understand pouring that caustic stuff over fish that was rotten to mask the flavors but how does it enhance the flavors? It doesnt.  ENTER: A mild raspberry vinagrette left over from a previous night's salad. Do you have any idea what an orgasmic epiphany I had that day? And after kicking it at Ryokos for a couple nights and stuffing myself (full even!) for about 5 dollars a roll I was sold. I closed a door and opened a window in to the new new demension that space navigators and versed hitchhikers call...\"okay I like sushi now.\"  As an added bonus they are usually spinning some fresh beats and have a DJ on the weekends. The service is as good as it gets and everyone is hella friendly. And I hate the word \"hella\" so you know it must be. As soon as you walk in everyone on staff is yelling hello to you and then they all chime in on a good bye when you walk out.

After about a 20-30 min wait, we crammed into this table in the corner with mini cushion cubes to sit on. We proceeded to order a bunch of beer and sake. The pitchers of beer were convenient but the house nigori was blah. We ordered an initial round of sushi, anticipating to order more once we figured out how hungry everyone was and what the hits were. Unfortunately it took foooooorever to get the sushi and we were reluctant to order more because we'd be there till dawn. Two hours and $400 later, in a drunken blur, I remember the gyoza as disappointing, tempura as heavy, nigiri as average and jumping tuna roll as drenched in the same heavy batter as the tempura.

To begin with there is no passing up the classics, miso soup & a wakama salad (seaweed and cucumber)-both only enhance what's yet to come.  As far as the rolls go, I would say it's a must to try the 'Pokeman' (salmon, mango, avocado) and the 'Hot Tail' (Yellowtail, Shiso and a spice)-both are wonderful!

I've been here a couple of times before, and I have to say, I was very disappointed this time. Since we were a large group, we were told that we had a 2 hour limit on a Saturday, which seemed reasonable. We ordered seaweed salad, a couple of rolls and a mass of sashimi, all at once. The rolls came before the sashimi (which was odd) and they were good. The problem was the sashimi. All of the sashimi had the skin on. ALL of it:  butterfish, himachi toro, shiro maguro, salmon, maguro. Also, everything except the salmon had hot sauce on it - sriracha!! Why would you ruin good fish with that?!?!? Also, they put lemon between each piece of the shiro maguro (my favorite) which was a nice presentation, but I am allergic to citrus. I have never seen shiro maguro (albacore) with lemon on it, and I order it everywhere it is on the menu. Under normal circumstances, we would order a bit, then more as the night progressed, but we were given a time limit and was delivered a bunch of (to me) inedible sashimi. Some people in the group didn't mind the hot sauce, the rest of us had to scrape it off and dunk the fish in the soy sauce to \"rinse\" it. Everyone complained about the skin. We ended up spending around $50 per person - which is excessive for the small portions (smallest sashimi I've ever seen). (On a side note, the last time we went there, we spent like $80 per person - this difference was a reflection of the fish). I went home and had a snack instead.", "author": "Cat U."}

Yes they fly in fish from Japan, but there are better places to get traditional sashimi and nigiri (like J-Town).  Go to this place for the non-traditional rolls and the awesome appetizers, which go great with a large bottle of nigori or Asahi or whatever alcohol happens to float your fancy.  As for apps: they make their own gyoza, provide free(!) edamame, and have the best karaage (fried) chicken in town.  If you're craving some cheese, they also have provolone wrapped and deep fried in wonton wrappers.  Updated childhood bliss.  Their rolls are pricey, but worth it.  The futomaki (traditional \"large\" roll of veggies, egg and crab) is another \"best in town\" item.  Now for you comedians, they have tons of \"Flying\" rolls--rolls covered in batter and deep fried (get it?  \"Flying\" instead of \"frying\" Still cracks me up.)  They even have inari.

The uni, toro, and ankimo are to die for!!  Unagi, hamachi, and the rolls could use a bit of help though.  Overall, I'd come back just for the three suggested(even though a bit pricey, so worth the love affair that goes on in the mouth!!).  =)", "author": "R L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-18", "description": "Starting off any sushi experience with a bottle of Nigori sake is the way I like to roll.  Speaking of rolls, I didn't have any.  Instead, after said bottle of sake with friend, we stuck primarily to nigri.  I was really impressed.  The sashimi list was excellent.  There were a lot of varieties you would not see at your typical sushi restaurant.  We ordered Spanish mackerel, fatty tuna, mackerel, and couple of other varieties.  When our platter arrived at our table, I was surprised how large the portions of beautifully cut fish were.  At most sushi places, I will just stick to various tuna varieties because lower quality species like mackerel can sometimes be on the fishy side and the texture can be a little tough.  But I let our server do the ordering this time, and I'm glad.  Each variety we had was really splendid.  Each variety had a super buttery texture, and it was the freshest sushi I have had in years.\n\nThis perfect sushi experience took place in some rather bizarre surroundings.  The restaurant is located down an obscure set of stairs. Once inside, the whole place is dark and purple with a big piano in the middle; with all the nooks and crannies, it looks like a Japanese mafia hangout or something.  It is kind of kitschy and pretty awesome.  The one thing I would have really liked was a piano signer.  Then, my hazy, purple experience could have been complete.", "author": "t l."}

It was as good as the first time.\nAfter a short wait, we took a seat at the bar and watched the staff at work.\nWe started with a bowl of edamame given to us on the house.\nWe both loved the Toro sushi and sashimi (we ordered it both ways).  We also had the Unagi and the Hamachi sushi. Yum!!\nThe fish is so fresh it is worth the wait it sometimes takes to get  your order.\nWe also tried the Volcano roll (the one with peanut butter) and the Dragon roll. Even though I am not a huge fan of peanut butter, the volcano roll was delicious.\nThe owner was behind the bar and chatting with customers as she worked with the staff to ensure smooth service.\nWe were also given a plate of mochi ice cream, with candle, in honor of the birthday boy.\nEverything was good and at a good price.\nThis is definitely a place I will return to.", "author": "Jenny J."}

I loved the hot tuna roll and the agedashi dofu... not so sure about the fried rolls but then they're really not my thing - everyone else seemed to love them! Still, it's a great option for dinner shared with friends (especially when everyone has different likes and dislikes), they have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and great music on Saturday nights. We felt like our server rushed us a little toward the end perhaps... but then this is a popular place! Would definitely go again.", "author": "Laura J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-23", "description": "i give 3 stars to Ryokos for the quality of food and prices.  The rolls we got weren't THAT impressive.  we even tried the peanut butter roll and to our surprise, none of us hated it.  the other rolls seemed kind of plain, nothing special.  don't get me wrong, i love sushi, and it was good, but nothing extraordinarily good.  and it was a little pricey because their rolls were pretty small.  we ordered three rolls to start, and they all came in the same plate, thats how small these rolls are!!  (slightly dissapointed by that!)  i LOVE their agedashi tofu, the best i've ever had. \ni'm giving Ryokos 4 stars, however, because of the ambience of hte place and the service.  we ordered two nigori sakes but our server suggested that we start off with one and when we were done he would bring out the other so that it'll remain cold.  and he did, without us even asking!  nice.  we were there for almost three hours, two hours ordering and eating and then an extra hour just hanging around talking.  and they didn't rush us at all even when there were people waiting for tables!  nice.  there was a dj playing loungey music.  overall i think we paid for the ambience of the place, but not for the food.  it wasn't a bad experience and i had a lot of fun by the end of the night.", "author": "r r."}

I would recommending that you not take a menu and just ask them to make what they have fresh. The chefs are really well trained and love to create things just for you. I would not call myself a regular, but they remembered me and created a special menu and it was fantastic. I would go more often, but it is all the way across town and not very kid friendly.

I went for the first time with my sister, her husband and a couple other friends who always go there and always spoke highly of it up until yesterday.  We were seated at a table and before we even got our food I looked up at the wall to see a cockroach crawling right beside me.  We all were in awe at what we were seeing when suddenly it landed on the table.  We all jumped up in disgust and told the waiter.  He sat us at another table and although we were all pretty grossed out at this point, we decided to give it another chance when moments later while we were eating a second cockroach proceeded to climb up the wall.  We told the waiter a second time and he was very apologetic and after he killed the insect he went and told someone, not sure if she was the manager/owner but she came over and was very apologetic (the sincerity  was questionable).  She also said that they were not aware of the issue..... ummmm.... how are you not aware that your restaurant is infested with roaches.  That in it of itself is either a lie or plain scary.  She gave us a pathetic discount and we still ended up paying around $100 to eat at this place.  We left disgusted, not satisfied and upset.  Needless to say none of us would ever go back.  I have been to a restaurant where a similar issue occurred, but they had the decency to take care of the whole bill and all we left was the waiter's tip.", "author": "Theresa P."}
