This was our first visit. Unfortunately, most of our experience there was not what we expected it to be for such a reputable and expensive restaurant. \nOn the positive side, our dishes were served at the exact same time, after we ate glorious slices of apple cardamom tea cake.  The smoked trout Benedicts and French toast were delicious too.  As for the crab buckwheat crepe my cousin was disappointed with its taste which leads into the negative part of our visit. \nAlthough we were seated right away it took a long while for our waitress to come, a tall young woman with golden blonde hair.  In an impersonal way she asked what we'd like to eat then left without taking a drink order.  After several tries my husband finally got her attention but she seemed annoyed, especially when we inquired about the French press type and to please serve us regular coffee and decaf for 2 people each.\nWell, 20 minutes passed and our coffee didn't come, although other customers, who had arrived after us, had received their coffees. My husband flagged down the waitress again and she became curt, saying it was still being prepared.  Once it arrived, 10 minutes later, we were surprised that the containers were small, enough for just one cup each.  Other tables had larger containers, even for couples, making us wonder if she should've asked us which size we'd like. \nIn addition, the waitress never came by to ask how we were doing.  We also noticed that she was very attentive and polite to other customers.  The only respite was another waitress who smiled while refilling our water glasses. Once our dour waitress gave us the check she said thank you in a condescending tone, making my husband and I regret our politeness and tipping her well. \nSince most of the customer crowd was young we couldn't help wondering if our waitress treated us shoddily because of our older age.  Nonetheless, we're not going back to this so-called classy restaurant since there's no telling if the kind of service we received will be repeated again.", "author": "Gerri L."}

The space is small, but the interior design is super simple and elegant. Parking wasn't too big a problem at all on a Sunday, and parking is also free!\n\nWe ordered the pear brioche, omelette, and mushroom tartine. The pear brioche wasn't the fluffy brioche I imagined--it was like a almond flavored, pear blondie. It wasn't too sweet, and perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The omelette was good, but somewhat of  a let down since there weren't any toppings inside. It was basically a rolled up sheet of egg covered in a hollandaise-like sauce, served with caesar salad. The omelette tasted almost like silken tofu, but it was definitely very intricately made. The mushroom tartine was good but a little too saucy for me.\n\nThis place was pretty good, but I would probably go for the poached benedict instead next time. However, it's worth a try if you've watched Atelier Crenn on Netflix's Chef's Table.", "author": "Sandra S."}

I'm personally a huge fan of Dominique Crenn and love Atelier Crenn. When we heard that Petit Crenn opened a few years ago, my husband and I have been discussing coming here for a visit. The timing never worked out quite right but we finally gave it a visit last month. It was a perfectly sunny and warm evening (I know, shocking weather in SF!) to visit Petit Crenn, which specialize in seafood. The only thing on the menu is a set course with seasonal seafood/vegetable. \n\nThe dishes were executed very well, and really showcase the ingredients. Why the 4 star? I think the meal was perfect for day we went, which was quite a warm evening during the summer (and something that isn't all too common in SF). We really enjoyed the \"cool\" meal that wasn't too heavy. But I can see that if I was hungrier that day and the weather was a bit cooler, I would prefer something with more substance and warmer. My husband wasn't entirely full after the meal, so we end up getting ice cream somewhere else. Overall, great meal and we plan to come back to try their brunch menu!", "author": "Sharon L."}

Not fancy but the food here is absolutely delicious. \n\nThe dishes here are simple in nature but are executed perfectly. The most surprising was the sourdough bread. Based on appearance it doesn't look like anything special but after taking a bite into the bread I was completely blown away. Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle I loved this bread so much. \n\nThe peas also were a real standout. The quality of the ingredients really stand out and the mint was a nice compliment to the crispness of the peas. The grilled fish was also delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

We were offered still or sparking water immediately, and we asked to see the alcohol menu. We got sparkling Rose.\n\nAs the rest of the group arrived, we were told a little bit about the menu, asked about dietary restrictions, and potential add-ons.  \n  \nSome notable things:\n- The dishes are generally vegetable and seafood focused.\n- When our wine was poured, the label was consistently facing the person receiving the pour. This is a really small, but significant detail in fine dining. \n- Wine selection is on point, but also very expensive. Individual glasses of wine are about 17ish, beer and cider have no options under 10 (there are only 4 or 5 options), and bottles of wine start at about 70. Average wine bottle is probably about 120ish.\n- The silverware seemed to have some water deposits (residual \"spots\" after being washed) or some imperfections that standout. Not really a big deal, but definitely noticeable. \n- Every dish was exceptionally put together.\n- The plates and silverware were thought out. Plates have a rustic feel, very aesthetically pleasing. \n- Service was always on point.\n- Napkin was folded when I used the restroom.\n- Feels comfortable / homey with upscale service.\n\nI think overall I had a great experience. It was approximately 195/person for the tasting menu, shared add-on dish, and a split bottle of wine (the cheapest one), tip, and tax. I don't know if the price per value is necessarily quite there though. I would probably expect this to be closer to 150, so we're not too far off. \n\nRecommended!", "author": "Kaje Y."}

I opted for her more casual restauarant Petit Crenn and I wasn't disappointed.  We got an amazing corner table right next to the window (where the light was great for taking some excellent photos). \n\nThe menu and decor reflects a very clean and modern esthetic with little whimisical touches, like the elegant silverware to the meticulously placed micro-flowers.  I was blown away by the affordable prix-fix menu - still pricey, but not as extragavant as Atelier Crenn.  The six-course tasting menu left us full, but not uncomfortably stuffed.\n\nI was hesitant with the seafood-heavy menu since I'm not a big fish fan, but Crenn's cooking left me convinced that you don't need meat to complete a meal. \n\n#1 course - canapes \ngougeres (pastry puffs) filled with cheese and topped with a shallot gelee.  these were absolutely amazing.  We subbed out the oysters for grilled nectarines which was also delicious. \n\n#2 tomatoe salad \nsubbed out the mussels for tomatoes.  this was the BEST tomato salad I've ever had.  love the cucumber gelee and the avocado mousse and the lemon verbana made the dish. \n\n#3 Tokyo Turnips\nLike a lot of yelpers, I was hesitant about the turnips since I'm not a big fan, but this version has me convinced to give these guys another chance. The consumme was very flavorful. \n\n#4 Entree - Grilled Mt. Lassen Trout\nI've never been a big fan of trout, but Crenn's version has changed the way I think about trout.  It's not fishy at all, but pretty meaty and substantial and the sauce vierge melded it all together.\n\n#5 Cheese plate - Bohemian Creamery, \"Cowabunga\" cheese\na semi-solid cheese that's more on the mild side and paired perfectly with the honey and tiny and surprisingly sweet cherry tomatos. \n\n#6 Dessert - Grand Macaron\nIf there had to be one dish I liked least, it is the dessert.  Up until this point, all of the dishes are light and elegant and the grand macaron is too big and sweet and dense.  If you love chocolate then you will love this dish.  I would have liked a lighter and smaller dessert - but that's totally my own personal preference. \n\nReally glad my last meal in SF was also the best.", "author": "Hieu H."}

Managed to snag a small group reservation when several friends and I were in town for a conference. From its stellar attentive service to its perfectly distilled and *light* version of French cuisine (with some Californian flair), Petit Crenn makes you feel like you're dining at a really high-end restaurant, at a fraction of the price.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you know you're in for a treat. It's a relatively small minimalist space, but it still feels airy and is beautifully decorated. The 6 course tasting menu is the name of the game here of course, with the option to upgrade for a few of the courses. We opted for one black truffle upgrade for one of the courses, but it wasn't quite worth it, the truffle got somewhat lost. That said though, every single course was amazing. Each dish had great contrasting flavors and texture at any given time. Any ingredient used felt fresh. Despite it being obviously French inspired food, it wasn't typically heavy as French food is (hello being cooked in 4 types of butter!). You come out of the meal not feeling overly bloated or full, you feel just right. The portions are small and well paced out, but by the end you don't still feel hungry at all. Oh, and I'd highly recommend doing the wine pairing, even if only the lower end one. The wines pair perfectly with all the courses.\n\nThat said, I'd gladly come back here the next time I'm in SF. Feels like it'll be one of those places where the menu constantly evolves and it'll always be a nice surprise eating there once again.", "author": "Jobye-Kyle K."}

We also opted for both supplements: some type of mushroom over potato pur\u00e9e and cheese with honeycomb. Everything was so delicious. The seafood paired perfectly with the fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. The grand macaron at the end was so decadent, yet perfectly balanced by the tartness of the pomegranate seeds.\n\nMy second visit was for Sunday brunch. We ordered the mushroom tartine, buckwheat crepe and grilled fish. Once again, I was delighted by all of the flavors. The mushroom tartine was probably my favorite of the three dishes--a pile of mushrooms atop sourdough bread. The mushrooms are very flavorful and have a nice acidity.

Asparagus, radish with trout roe and dill creme fraiche.  This was a surprising and excellent dish that really embodies San Francisco to me. It's a balanced combination of east meets west, visually stunning and really playful. \n(3).  Brioche - this was not officially on the tasting menu list but was really good.\n(4).  Tsar Nicoulai Caviar with spring vegetables. This was outstanding and one of two available supplements and even though it's a pricey $80, I have no regrets. \n(5).  Burgundy Escargot, Buckwheat Crepe, Green Garlic, Wild Mushroom plus the Black Truffle Supplement. This was the highlight of the meal for me. Just perfect. \n(6).  Halibut, Swiss Chard, Young Ginger and Citrus Jus.  This was a solid entree and the Swiss Chard brings all the elements together.\n(7).  White Cheese, English Peas, Meyer Lemon and Grilled Levain. This dish was really bright and playful. Really enjoyable and it put a smile on my face. \n(8).  Citron Tart, Candied Meyer Lemon and Grapefruit. This was just the perfect dessert. \n(9).  Small sweets to end the meal. \n\nService and ambiance was excellent as well. I really cannot understand why this place doesn't have a Michelin star. At $95 (gratuity included), this offers an outstanding value.

The escargot with green garlic atop a mushroom-filled buckwheat crepe was tasty and inventive. The housemade brioche with butter and salt was perfect. And the lemon tarte with candied meyer lemon was to die for. Finally, the super simple Full Belly Farms asparagus with radish dish was amazingly clean and delicate, yet expertly prepared.\n\nBy the time the main protein--a relatively boring San Diego halibut with swiss chard--came I was pretty full and didn't feel like I needed a substantive protein dish. But the halibut was beautifully seasoned and cooked. The swiss chard was ok, but definitely the weakest link of the night.\n\nService was attentive, but not overbearing. The six-course meal ran about two hours. \n\nIf I had to critique one thing, it would be the wine list. While I understand they're serving only very, very good wines (and beer), listing a few less-expensive bottles wouldn't be a bad move. There are great wines out there that can still be profitable without being outrageously expensive.

You have to speak a little louder to hold a conversation but honestly it's worth it.\n\nOn offer that evening was the tasting menu. They offered a supplement menu as well. I'm not sure I enjoyed having options for a tasting menu as I prefer to go with a story from a directed menu.  So we bowed out of those options as tempting as they were.\n\nI will say this, every dish we were served had this delicate freshness that embodied this locally sourced ideology. Even if you didn't know that - you could tell. Crisp, flavourful and not heavy handed in the seasoning. The ingredients just sing with the seafood and vegetables.\n\nAs someone who isn't a fan of oysters - I really enjoyed the tomales bay oysters! delicious.\nThe gougeres were airy and crisp with a nice finish. Great little pastry to start.\n\nHands down my favourite dish was the heirloom tomatoes. I crave it still. It was perfect.  The coriander, the anise - the broth the tomatoes, watermelon were bathed in - a dreamlike bath for my palette.\n\nThe next dish was the tokyo turnips in a lobster ginger consomm\u00e9. I enjoyed it but i'm not a big fan of turnips so i can't say it was my favourite.

The items were presented beautifully, had unique and lasting flavor and flowed effortlessly. I was more than excited to see Dominique herself walk in. I felt like a school kid seeing a hero. After much anxiety and wondering, my husband said, \"go introduce yourself \". Finally trailing behind him, I did. So happy I did. She is warm and charming, and an absolute delight. You can really see the love of the craft emulating from her every fiber. \n\nOn another note, I'm not typically a consumer for seafood. Other than some crab, salmon or scallops, I've always found seafood bland and lifeless. Boy has my mind been forever changed. The delicacy that the food was handled with, layered with complex yet simple ingredients was an absolute sensation. Also, I was delighted at the way they handled my celiac dietary restrictions. As most restaurants replace gluten ingredients with things that can be rather boring in comparison to the original ingredients. \n\nMy husband and I will be back!", "author": "Trina G."}

We also found out later that the restaurant was owned by the famous French chef Dominique Crenn, owner of both Petit Crenn and Atelier Crenn. Petit Crenn, was a more casual un-formal dining. I have yet to try the two Michelin star Atelier Crenn, but saw both of the restaurants was also featured on the Netflix TV series Chefs Table, very inspiring and touching story of chef Crenn's life journey. So definitely on my \"to do\" list.\n\nService: \nPetite Crenn is a small, cute, intimate restaurant. Greeted and serviced by friendly staff.  We liked the fact that they included service charge within the dishes (no judgment, no fuss). Thank you chef Crenn for paying your workers correctly, unlike the other restaurants. \n\nThey use a cute chair design for the restaurant but not practical as it was wobbly and my husband felt unsafe when he was sitting on it and felt like he would fall off if he sits on either side of the chair. Chair material was plastic, so it felt a bit cheap. \n\nFood:\nWe ordered 2 mushroom tartines and an mussels appetizer (special of the day). $20 for each dish. The mushroom tartine was interesting, tasty and original. A good size piece of toast that will make you full. Loved the piled mushrooms on top of the toast. Although, the sourness was a bit too over powering for me and the side of the toast was a bit too hard that it started hurting the top of my gums by the time I finished eating (we had the same hard bread on the side for our mussel dish as well).  I guess some people like eating bread that's super hard on the outside. I thought the presentation of the toasts that we got wasn't as nicely presented like how I saw it on some of the other photos with nicely decorated mini purple flowers on top. Nevertheless, it was still a good piece of toast. The mussels was a bit bland and I thought the sauce/cream could be a bit more thicker as it was a kind of watery. \n\nParking:\nWe were lucky enough to find free street parking on a Sunday that was pretty close to the restaurant, without having to go around the area a few times. otherwise like the restaurant suggested, could park at the performing arts garage.", "author": "Sisi H."}

(We actually had seen someone order chocolate cake at the bar before we sat down, and originally asked to swap out the fromage blanc mousse for that, but the couple at the table next to us convinced us not to. I'm glad we listened.) Another big surprise was the salad, which doesn't look or sound like anything special, but was so good.\n\nOverall, just a really great experience that was well worth the cost.

I don't really understand the super harsh criticism of Petit Crenn. I felt like our meal was reasonably priced and I was definitely full by the end of our meal. Favorites from the evening were the gnocchi with mushrooms, some beautifully crafted bread that accompanied the cheese course we added on, and of course, dessert with a giant macaron. The main entree for the evening was a striped bass, and while I don't love cooked fish, this was good but wished the crispy skin wasn't so salty. Service was good at the beginning where the dishes came out quickly with few breaks in between.

It was a prix fixe menu aka set menu with fixed price for $87 per person (gratuity included). Not sure if you can order a la carte at the counter (I've observed other people at the counter received different dishes than us), but we weren't given the a la carte menu so we just went along. Service was very friendly but a bit slow at times. The restaurant was very accommodating when it came to dietary restrictions but I think that's one of the reasons that the service was a bit slow. \n\nWe started with some house made brioche and butter and some canopes (variety of small bites); that particular evening they served pink scallop crudo, gougeres (mini cheesy puff pastry), and some radishes with herb butter. A great way to start our meal. Everything tasted fresh and the brioche and the gougeres were well made. \n\nNext we had the artichoke with some mussels and the roasted new potatoes with caramelized onions and cheese. Both dishes were excellent. The artichoke and mussels tasted bright and refreshing, and the potatoes were so creamy and comforting. \n\nOnto the main course now. We had the seared salmon and a couple of small side dishes. They were grilled mushrooms with garlic scapes and grilled zucchini. Again everything was well prepared, the salmon had a crispy skin and the beurre blanc sauce was excellent. The zucchini was grilled to perfection! They were all very tasty. \n\nThe dessert course was amazing. It was a tart with lemon curd and lemon verbena cream. The only complain was I had to share it with my dining partner lol since everything was served family style. \nThey also served us some small bite desserts at the end of our meal. That night they served us a couple of French macarons, pate de fruit, and caramels. \n\nOverall I had a great experience. Portion was on the smaller side, but it was a prix fixe menu after all. I think at $87 per person, it's a bit pricey considering we only had a small portion of protein! But I gave it four stars since all of the dishes were all delicious and well prepared.", "author": "Sam M."}

And by you, I mean ME.\n\nPetit Crenn is located in at one end of the bustling Hayes Valley, further away from the center of the action. Parking may be hard to find right on Hayes, but if you go just a block out, it shouldn't be a problem. There are plenty of bars and boutiques around the area that you can browse before/after your meal. The interior is relatively small and simple: clean, white walls and modern chairs. Lively music is playing in the background, which definitely lifted the mood. It felt classy, but not uptight.\n\nI made a reservation for 5:30PM dinner. There were 3 other parties at that time. We were quickly greeted and shown to our table by the window, which was enjoyable taken the great weather that day. The restaurant soon filled up as our meal progressed. Dinner is a preset menu (gratuity already included), which is shown on the wall, so you'll only get a drink menu. I opted for some wine and my boyfriend a French beer, which both complimented our seafood quite well. It does seem like the menu changes from time to time, but for our particular meal, our eight courses included the following:\n\n*Brioche bread, butter and sea salt: The slices were pretty large, but upon picking it up, you realize how light and airy it is. SO GOOD\n*Canapes (hors dourves): This included 3 separate items - Oysters with a mignonette, gougeres, and a couple of fresh turnips with a dollop of dip. The mignonette complimented the oysters well, and they were not too fishy. The gougeres were supurb! The gruyere cream in the middle was not too overwhelmingly cheesy. The turnips were very fresh and refreshing. You can eat the stems too!\n*Salad: You can tell everything was very fresh. My boyfriend very much enjoyed the green dressing.\n*Octopus Cassoulet: The octopus was cooked well, very tender and not rubbery. To my delight, there were more turnips as well. The fried shallots were also a nice compliment\n*Gnocchi a la Parisienne: The gnocchi came out at the same time as the Halibut and the Asparagus. The dish was very beautiful, topped with edible flowers, and also very tasty. The peas and beans are super crisp and fresh. Not the best gnocchi I've ever had, but still good.\n*Roasted Alaskan Halibut: A very simple looking dish by itself. The halibut was flaky. The sauce was light enough that it didn't overwhelm the taste of the fish, but flavorful enough to compliment the fish. \n*Asparagus: Another beautiful plate with brioche crumbs and flowers covering the fresh asparagus. Don't forget the aioli!\n*Cr\u00e8me Caramel: Hmm...Rhubarb...I've never had any strong feelings about rhubarb so I was a bit skeptical. But it actually turned out really great! It might be my favorite course out of the menu. All the different elements worked really well together in my opinion. \n*Mignardises: Rhubarb flavored gummy, macaron, and caramel. The caramel was definitely my favorite out of the three.\n\nCloser to the end of our meal, I began to realize how full I was. Despite the dishes being small in size, I was surprised to find myself quite stuffed. What I do like is that gratuity is already included. No fussing with calculating at the end of our meal. \n\nI think many people, after watching The Chef's Table, may be expecting life-changing dining experience from a Dominique Crenn restaurant, but to expect that from Petit Crenn isn't really fair. I'm sure that Atelier would meet that expectation much better. As for Petit Crenn, I see it as a introduction to the fabulousness of Dominique Crenn's talent.", "author": "Monica V."}

Overall, nothing special, and would not come back. \n\nI knew that coming to Petit Crenn meant that I would just need to eat what menu they decided to serve that night. Nothing they decided to serve that night blew me away or seemed creative in any way.\n\nOur menu for the night was:\n1. Petit Crenn Brioche\n2. Canapes (Crudite, gougeres, Kusshi Oyster)\n3. Cherry tomato, cucumber, elderflower, ikura salad\n4. Zuckerman Farm Potatoes (with aged goat cheese, caramelized onion)\n5. King Salmon with sides of confit sweet peppers and Brentwood corn (with porcini mushroom and spring onion)\n6. K&J Orchard's Apricot Tart Tatin (with lemon-thyme ice cream, coriander).  \n\nThe brioche was the highlight of my meal. The brioche was nicely toasted and served warm. The only thing we got more than 1 of, the entire meal, were these puff things that had cheese in them. The oysters were oysters, nothing special. I could have done without the beets. Nothing was special about them, they were just beets. The cherry tomato salad was good, but didn't blow me away. The potatoes were meh. The aged goat cheese, sadly, didn't add much to the dish. The salmon was cooked medium rare, which was fine. I don't like peppers, so I avoided the confit of sweet peppers. My coworker who did eat the peppers thought that the dish was too pepper-y. It was peppers on peppers on peppers. She thought that they could have added something to change up the flavor. The corn was kind of this pile of blended corn. Meh. The tart was my least favorite course. I didn't feel like the flavors came together well, and I like apricot.\n\nOverall, I would have preferred less courses and just had 3-4 solid courses. I didn't like needing to share everything with my coworker. How awkward would it have been if we weren't coworkers and that we were going out on on a 2nd or 3rd date? The slice of salmon we got was  thin and I definitely could have made a run to Taco Bell or McDonald's afterwards because I left a bit hungry. The service wasn't that great either. We couldn't flag somebody down when we wanted the check or wanted more water. Because we sat at the Chef's table, I became very close with the pole that I needed to sit up against.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-01", "description": "KenScale: 8.5/10\n\nThe restaurant world today is still dominated by male chefs and that has been one constant criticism of restaurant reviews and rankings around the world. I for one believe that female chefs can do great things just as well as their male counterparts. One chef that has caught my attention is Dominique Crenn who was featured in the Chefs Table series on Netflix. I was enamored with her background and culinary philosophy featured in the documentary and really wanted to try either her haute cuisine establishment Atelier Crenn or the more casual bistro style restaurant Petit Crenn on my next visit to San Francisco. Recently my wife Jun and I traveled to the Bay Area over the Memorial Day weekend to visit the venue in Napa Valley for our wedding in the fall and I figured this trip was a perfect opportunity to visit one of these restaurants. Since we were supposed to meet up with a mutual friend in the city on the day we landed in SF, I decided to place a reservation at Petit Crenn. Overall, there was a lot to like about the dining experience here.\n\nThe theme at Petit Crenn is a family-style dinner party. You get a set menu at vegetables and seafood at $87 per person, all in large formats appropriate for sharing. One thing that I always love about restaurants in the Bay Area is the consistent emphasis on the quality of ingredients. When my wife Jun tasted pink scallop crudo, she said she knew this dinner was going to be special. Since Jun doesn't take raw seafood very well unless it is fresh, I felt very comfortable with what will be coming after she remarked that the scallop was quite delicious. The freshness of ingredients kept showing throughout our meal. Artichoke with mussels, baby carrot, fennel and parsley displayed the citrusy flavor that was not unpleasant for a dish at the beginning of the meal. My favorite dish of the night was gnocchi with English peas. Gnocchi is certainly not one of my favorite pasta dishes as I often find the texture of the dumplings to be a bit too soft for me, but the one at Petit Crenn really nailed the texture (having the right amount of firmness to it while still keeping the essence of gnocchi) and the fresh English peas added another dimension to the dish. It really did make me feel like I was eating at a farm with all the ingredients sourced directly from the farm. I felt the seasoning on Spanish mackerel could've been toned down a little bit, but the fish was overall very well cooked, and the side dish of roasted potatoes with local goat cheese and caramelized onions offered a perfect hearty complement to the mackerel. For the dessert, I still can't forget the delightful penny royal cr\u00e8me caramel with rhubarb jam and pistachio. It displayed an awesome complexity of different flavor and texture from different elements all packed in one beautiful plating without being too sweet.\n\nIt's always good to book a reservation in advance especially with chef Dominique's growing profile, although I saw that the turnover on a Friday evening (granted it was the start of a long weekend so presumably a lot of people in the city left town) was more frequent than I had thought. The French-centric wine list skews toward more organic, natural and biodynamic varieties (one gripe that I had about Petit Crenn since I don't like those kinds). I really loved the cozy, welcoming vibe of the white d\u00e9cor with menus handwritten on blackboards to give a sense that you're not really dining at a restaurant but are participating in a supper party that is meant for enjoying food together without much fuss. If you want an experience of how a French bistro meets California cuisine is in action, Petit Crenn is a perfect place to be; I hope chef Dominique can keep up the awesome work she has already been doing. After all, especially in this day and age where misogyny is being viewed as tolerable, we need more female voices in the restaurant world.", "author": "Ken S."}

We are busy people/parents and have had our fair share of dining out and takeout after spending a decade in NYC and a few years near NOLA and Denver. After awhile, the oils and faux food they use cheapen the experience. I'm happy to do what we do and the risk is that the restaurant we choose for our \"mini-vacation\" will not be great. This is NOT true of Petit Crenn.\n\nThis place is classy, but not stuffy at all. I'm tired of stuffy restaurants (and mediocre service). Our server was completely attentive, can't communicative and not over the top. Although we did not sit near the kitchen, I had a great view and it was fun to see how much care they put into every dish.\n\nThe ambiance is exactly how I'd decorate my restaurant or living room: cute, cozy, simple. The lighting was perfect. \n\nAs far as the dishes go, they very with you once you make your reservation that your food preferences. They double check again once you are seated. \n\nEach dish was perfect. We aren't carb consumers but we purposely didn't state this. The dishes are vegetable and seafood, with a side of brioche or bread here or there. We've had many a meals in France and I have to say, it would be unAmerican not to serve some large pieces of carbs. They looked beautiful, but we stuck with eating just the butter. In a land where real butter is hard to come by, a tablespoon of real butter is amazing. We had the caviar over and omelette. One of the top ten bites of goodness my mouth has ever had. And the swordfish - my husband and I were talking about swordfish the other day and asking if either of us have ever tasted swordfish that's good. We laughed, because swordfish is usually dry and tasteless. Not at Petit Crenn! For a moment it became my favorite fish. But I know not to get too excited because I'll have to go back only there if I don't want to be disappointed.\n\nWe never drink wine anymore. It's been two years, we realized, since our last glass. We each had a glass (different) and it perfectly accompanied the meal.", "author": "Jen L."}

We were able to sit at the bar and watch everything being prepared too, which I definitely recommend. The chefs were so friendly and frequently checked in to make sure that we were enjoying everything.\n\nWe enjoyed:\n\n- Vancouver oysters\n- Grilled squid stuffed with shrimp, wild rice, and topped with some baby squids\n- Fluke, grilled squash, and gnocchi\n- Lil gems salad\n- Pear galette\n\nThe squid, the fluke, and the lil gems were definitely the stars to me. The squid was served in a delicious soft and they gave us this light, fluffy bread to sop it up with. A lot of the food is prepared over their mega dope open flame grill, but the fluke dish worked the most perfectly with this preparation. It was expertly charred. I also really liked the squash and I'm not usually a fan. The salad was SO GOOD and I know what you're saying, \"It's an effing salad.\" It was a damn good effing salad. The pear galette was tasty. Not too sweet and I loved the crumbly element that they topped it with. It could have used a little bit more ice cream, but I was definitely full by the end of the meal.\n\nHat's off to Petit Crenn and hoping that I can visit Atelier Crenn soon, too!", "author": "Carol B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-21", "description": "Dominique Crenn is one bad ass two Michelin starred chef who was named the World's Best Female Chef in 2016 by San Pellegrino. I enjoyed fancy pants Luce and loved Atelier Crenn for Crenn's whimsical, orchestrated courses. But let's be real, unless you wipe your a$$ with Benjamins, who can regularly afford to eat a $300 meal (sans alkie) there?\n\nWhen Petit Crenn opened last year, I hurriedly made reservations but then cancelled them after perusing the menu and seeing the negative reviews. While Petit Crenn is much more casual with a family-style menu that's based on the dishes Crenn's mother and grandmother cooked, it didn't look very interesting nor enticing. \n\nFast forward a year later, I was talking a long stroll during my lunch break and passed by Petit Crenn. I thought it would be good place for my friend and I to have a leisurely, catch-up lunch since it looked rather peaceful. I made reservations but they weren't needed.  \n\nThe lunch menu is basically an a la carte version of the prix-fixe dinner menu with the addition of two tartines. Prices ranges from the $8 Josey Baker bread to the $38 Whole Roasted Trout. Beer, cider, and wine only. All prices include gratuity. \n\nConsidering the menu is small (less than 10 items), basic, and has pretty much been the same since they opened, the food was underwhelming and overly salty, as others have mentioned. Some dishes could easily be put together at home with items from the farmer's market. \n\nWhile you're essentially paying $9 for an amuse bouche that should be complimentary, the Goug\u00e8res w/ gruy\u00e8re cream, pickled shallot gel ($9): http://bit.ly/2eZ5dbq were some damn delicious balls. When you bite into the delicate pastry shell, the warm, salty gruy\u00e8re just explodes in your mouth. The pickled shallot added a nice contrasting sweet and sourness. It was the best bite we had at lunch.\n\nOur server recommended the Market Tomato Salad w/ ch\u00e8vre ($13): http://bit.ly/2enYMhp. The tomatoes were nicely ripen and the cheese was fine but this was very ordinary. \n\nWe also ordered the Smoked Trout Tartine w/ caper fromage blanc, pickled shallot ($16): http://bit.ly/2eo1W4A to share. The Josey Baker bread was perfectly crusty with a good chew but the smoked trout was too salty. I know smoked fish is usually salty but this was more salty than smoky. \n\nI was looking forward to the Petit Crenn Omelette w/ fines herbes, creme fra\u00eeche ($15): http://bit.ly/2eo3VG5 but it was a complete let down. While the omelette was fluffy, it was monotonous after two bites. I appreciate simplicity but it felt it needed more than just cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to liven it up. The worst part of the dish was that some parts of the omelette and bibb lettuce were excessively sprinkled with sea salt flakes. Upon biting into these parts, it gave us that Botox induced surprised face and duck lips look. I found myself trying to pick off the flakes of salt while my friend didn't even bother finishing her half. \n\nOur bill was brought in this beautiful shell along with orange p\u00e2te de fruits: http://bit.ly/2eqv0aj. The orange jelly had an unpleasant sour finish so we went to Smitten afterwards for some ice cream. \n\nOur server was friendly and not pretentious but they really do the absolute minimum here. After receiving our order, there was no check-in and we had to ask for serving utensils which should have been automatic. Food service was timely and we were finished in about 45 minutes. There was a lady that just stood at the FOH doing nothing. Would have been nice if she pitched in and helped our lone server or thanked customers as they're leaving. But, nada. \n\nThe space is very minimalist with funky white slither dining chairs and wooden tables. I liked the pillow throws which gave a nice coziness with the 80s-90s slow jams playing in the background. Tables are very close to each other so be prepared to breathe onto your neighbors and vice-versa. \n\nI'm glad I tried Petit Crenn once but the food here is not representative of Crenn's culinary talent. I highly recommend skipping Petit Crenn and going ham at Atelier Crenn. You'll probably end up eating top ramen until your next paycheck like I did but YOLO!

You won't leave this place hungry -- portions are quite decent! -- and most of the time the dishes are well paced (every so often we will get a long wait of around 30 minutes between courses, usually before the entree).\n\nService is pretty good, could be a bit more attentive and quick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "Having heard so much about Dominique Crenn from my sister, I was excited to score reservations at one of her spots. This is more casual than Atelier Crenn, but none the cheaper. I was here for lunch so didn't get to try the tasting menu, but pretty much did most of the lunch menu items.\n\nUpon walking in, it was pretty empty since it had just opened I believed. We started off with the cream puffs (I don't know the fancy word for them; judge me) that were injected with foam cheese and fish gel. It sounds totally weird but honestly they were pretty great for a first bite.  Second came the figs, which were okay but they're just figs. I could pick them off my friend's backyard and add some feta on top and it would probably be just as amazing. Half dozen oysters came out and presented on a bed of salt.  I'm not sure what they had in the sauce over them but they were refreshing. Smaller oysters though and not your gigantic ones that often can have an overwhelming ocean taste. I split two entrees; the cured trout tartine and the sole fish. I would definitely get the tartine again as it was salty and a little bit of sour all in one.  The sprinkles of dill was a nice touch to keep the tastebuds interested.  If you like tilapia, the sole fish will be good for you. I just felt like there was too much oil used and that made it much more rich than it should have been. \n\nLastly, the dessert menu for lunch was a single option. The paris-brest is like a love child of the donut and custard.  When you get too legends like that combined in one dish, it almost becomes iconic.  And after a quick Google search, apparently it's probably a top five French dessert.  This one had an orange caramel touch to it and I don't regret ordering it all for myself.  \n\nThe service itself here is good but the delivery of food can be slow.  Given the portion of the food, it doesn't take much time to eat unless you're a slow eater.  Time between each plate runs about 20-30 minutes and that gets on my nerves when I'm hungry.  However, the staff are attentive and also at the mercy of the kitchen so I'm understanding.  You should prepare to be there for about 2 hours to fully enjoy the experience.", "author": "Quoc N."}

With a high expectation on the \"Best Female Chef\" by the World's 50 Best organization last year, we found there was a huge lack of touch and soul in the food. For the price they charged, totally not worth it. Completely ruined a well planned date. Bummer!\n\nWe tried the tasting menu. Nothing really made us feel like Bretagne. One of us was born and raised in Bretagne (un)fortunately. From the presentation, quality of ingredient to the cooking, everything is at mediocre level. The open kitchen is not really for cooking but warming up food and assembling plates. The smoke reached to an unpleasant level. There are bunch really young cooks behind the chef's counter. Couldn't believe my eyes in a $$$$ place. I saw one young guy was chewing food or gum while cooking.  I took a photo when a girl was preparing the appetizers from a container of mussels with a shocking label 'mussel 3/2' which was 7 days ago. From the seafood served we can tell whoever in charge didn't do a good job picking the high quality stuff. The clams and mussels were so small. Gnocchi was served. Really? Did you claim grandma cooking style?! Maybe the grandma is not from Brittany. The dessert pairing didn't go well. Ganache with sweet white wine, really? The ganache is dense, would prefer to have port. \n\nService overall is not bad. I am just disappointed for the gap between what was promoted vs what really it is. when a chef carrying such an authentic Brittany style produced something completely irrelevant, I feel deeply upset. We went there for Dominique Crenn, for Bretagne, for French cuisine... but we didn't get what we thought we would. Paid over $300 for a dinner just to learn the sad truth about Crenn.

The space inside is pretty cramped and the host pointed us to the outside bench. After fifteen minutes waiting in the cold, we walked back in and inquired about our table, which was still being set up. The rest of the service was fine but this set the wrong tone to begin with.\n\nWe have been to other restaurants with tasting menus in the same ballpark pricing-wise. The idea behind a tasting menu is that the chef is responsible for crafting the sequence of dishes. As a customer, the expectation is to sit and wait to be served without thinking twice about it. But the experience at Le Petit Crenn was different: to our surprise, several items on the menu were listed as supplemental (for up to an extra ~$70 for a 1oz serving of caviar).\n\nThis feels like a very cheap move. We ordered one supplemental item, the cheese. We had ordered the standard wine pairing, but the cheese was not covered by that and we were encouraged to order a separate glass, which is another cheap move in my opinion. The dinner was frankly expensive, even by San Francisco standards. With tip, we ended up with a $450 tab for 2 people. This is fairly pricey for a meal where left feeling like we missed out on the best the restaurant had to offer.\n\nThe sheer quantity of food was also disappointing. Other restaurants of the same caliber serve dishes small in size but with numerous fillers and small surprises in between. At le Petit Crenn, what you see on the menu is strictly what you will get, barring for the pricy optional dishes. We left the restaurant hungry despite a pretty deep hole in our pockets.\n\nThe food itself was good but nothing exceptional -- all dishes were well executed but without any real surprising or inventive flavors. Of all we ate, the asparagus was probably the best dish we got, but let's be real: this was basically three or four shoots that are well cooked and seasoned. Overall, the food was not par for a $95 price tag.", "author": "Julien S."}

Marking up a bottle that retails for $40 to $145 is just ridiculous. And asking $80 to add caviar to the menu is kind of greedy. \nThe food itself is very good and fresh. But not exactly creative.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-19", "description": "NOTE:\nMy gf got an email from Petit Crenn pointing out we got the Chef's table menu instead of the regular menu. That's why the courses were \"out of order\". The posted menu is their regular menu at $79, so if you're wondering what's different about the Chef's table, you get 2 extra courses, but they omit a course. In essence, you're getting an extra dish for an extra $41.\n\nI had a fun time here, but alcohol and good company can always provide that, regardless of venue. My review is based solely on my thoughts of the food and the service. All I wanted was an explanation of the menu and dishes we were getting. I don't think that's too much to ask.\n\nREVIEW:\nA group of us had dinner here last Saturday, March 12th at 8:30pm for a girlfriend's birthday. We had a reservation for a party of 6, but someone decided to join us last minute. The restaurant was nice enough to do some rearranging to accommodate our party of 7.\n\nI guess the restaurant has 2 seatings: one at 6pm & another at 8:30pm. Either the 2nd seating was running late or they build in time for a drink as we didn't sit down until 8:50pm.\n\n*NV Zoemie de sousa, brut classique, champagne ($20 glass) \u00d72\n*NV Julien fouet, cremant de loire ($13 glass) \u00d73\n*2015 Petit crenn rose, rootdown wine cellars, amador ($12 glass)\n\nWe all ordered a drink at the bar. I got a glass of the crement de loire. It was crisp, refreshing & not too sweet. Perfect for me as I just wanted something bubbly to start the night.\n\nChef's table ($120 each):\n*Kusshi oyster: champagne gelee, preserved meyer lemon\n*Gnocchi a la parisienne: hen of the woods mushrooms, meyer lemon\n*Butter bean casserole: braised swiss chard, smoked breadcrumbs\n*Roasted carrot salad: candied kumquats, hazelnuts, creme fraiche\n*Market fish: sauce vierge, crispy garlic\n*Little gem salad: caper vinaigrette, golden beets, mimolette tuile\n*Chamomile panna cotta: rhubarb, basil, candied seeds\n*Mignardises\n\nWe started off with an Amuse bouche, or three. The 1st, I believe, was an ahi tuna spoon. The 2nd plate included a puff (I think with lemon?) & the 3rd item was an egg centered snack. It reminded me of the korean rolled egg dish.\n\nThe menu above was what they posted on their walls. During our service, they skipped a dish, substituted another & served some stuff out of order. It was really confusing. I thought the reason the restaurant only did 2 seatings was because it was going to be banquet style. Everyone gets the same dish at the same time. But it wasn't that way at all. I felt like we were behind most tables.\n\nMy favorite dish on the menu was the oysters. They were very fresh & clean. They never served us the bean course, but we got a scallop dish & a mussel dish instead. The scallops were tasty & tender. The mussels came in a nice broth. I don't like beans so I was glad we didn't get that dish.\n\nFor some reason, they had skipped the gnocchi course, so we asked them about it. The first thing I smelled when I walked into the restaurant was the butter from this dish and it smelled delicious. We eventually got it, but I don't know if they meant to serve it out of order or if they forgot to give us the course. My gfs loved the gnocchi but I thought it was too rich. There was nothing to cut into the fattiness.\n\nFor me, the rest of the meal went downhill. I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots. The server ended up taking my plate without asking me if I was done. I had literally only taken two tiny bites. They bring out the market fish to show you before they prepare it. I love fish, so I was looking forward to this dish. Unfortunately, the fish was slightly overcooked & the skin was super salty. So the top of my piece was over seasoned while the bottom was bland.\n\nI didn't really eat the rest of the dishes as I don't like beets or rhubarb much. It was a shame as I love salad! They did offer me a salad without beets, but that was after I went to the restroom & stepped outside. It felt out of place and too late since our server didn't ask when she served the salad course. We did get a small piece of a creamy cheese w/one of our last courses. I was happy we got that as I love cheese.\n\nBottles:\n*NV Zoemie de sousa, brut classique, champagne ($75)\n*2014 Dom de champarian, sauvignon blanc, menetou-salon, loire ($47)\n*2012 Domaine montvac, adage, grenache, gigondas ($65)\n*2012 Castello di verduno, nebbiolo, barbaresco ($88)\n\nWe ordered three bottles over the course of our meal. One bottle was enough to get a small pour per person. A few of us ended the night with a Double espresso ($3).\n\nMaybe I came on the wrong night. It's obvious the menu didn't suit my tastes. I was ready to give them 3 stars until I thought about the service. I expected more from a restaurant that charges $120 pp. Serving dishes out of order w/no explanation and the clearing of a full plate w/o asking seems like issues a restaurant of this calibur shouldn't have.

Props to her. \n\nThe menu changes nightly so I'll give you a little perspective into ours. \n\nKushi Oysters - Um, yes please.\nAnchovies w/ Olive Oil and Lemon - Get in my face. \nEgg Omelette - let's just call em \"Air Eggs\". \nEscargot in Mushroom Broth - Snails, mushrooms. Like eating the Burgundian floor. \nNoodles and Cheese - ok, it was fancy mac and cheese w breadcrumbs. \nWhole Trout - barely cooked and on the verge of sushi. Radical. \n\nI'll be back to sit at the bar and do a wine paring with my meal. Boom haters.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

It was simply a touch above mediocre, which of course is disappointing since this restaurant is associated with Dominique Crenn. \n\nI did enjoy the vibe. It's unpretentious. It's a cute, cozy space with tons of light pouring in. I love the menu on the chalkboard. It seemed as though some couples were able to come in without reservations and sit at the bar (which I love to do). \n\nI have to admit that I am writing this a month after my dinner there and here is one of the issues: I cant remember what we ate!! There was an interesting halibut crudo served on almond butter. There was an incredible sweet corn dish. Maybe something with salmon?? I do remember liking all of the canapes we started with, though once again I couldn't tell you what they were. Anyway, the meal was probably a B+ and I would totally consider coming back; however, I will be crossing off everything else on my list first. \n\nSide note: We also came on one freakishly warm day in SF. Our table was in the front window and we were SO HOT. My brother in law had to go outside to take a breather halfway through. I understand that this is not the norm and nobody in SF has air conditioning, but this might have affected my enjoyment of the food. I'm a delicate flower, what can I say??", "author": "Molly S."}

Both are curated by perhaps one of the most celebrated female chefs today, Dominique Crenn. \n\nPetit Crenn is pushing the long up and coming Hayes Valley foodie scene up Hayes street another block, just past (and next to) Suppenk\u00fcche. It has a cozy but open design, and a minimalist pure design scheme as mastered by Akemi Tamaribuchi of Subject to Change design. White on white wall hangings, modern white plastic dining chairs, white bulbs on rope lighting. There are perhaps 12 tables por deux on the main wall, and another 3 against the front window, that can be shifted to work for 4, 6. There is also a chef's counter with another 10 seats or so, which can be for walk-ins and a la carte diners from 5 - 7pm Tue - Sat. \n\nThe tables, however intimately arranged (they are close together, so if you have a large bum, sit on the outside or you won't get in and out without spilling your neighbor's wine glass!), are for Prix Fixe 7 course seafood and veggie Chef Menu tasting meals, in 2 seatings Tuesday through Saturday, and Sunday there is only a 6pm seating, none after. This goes for $87/pp, gratuity included. They serve no rezzie lunch from 11 - 2pm. There is a more extensive Chef's Table experience, rezzies required in advance, $200/pp. Their wine pairing adds $65. \n\nMy dining companion, who was generous to offer this meal as an early birthday gift to me, and I had table rezzies, and sat at the far end table, just under the daily Chalkboard menu, so only people on 1 side of us. (See menu pic.) \n\nWe opted for a bottle of Brut Rose bubbly for drinking with our meal. On our second dish, our server accidentally knocked over my flute toward my companion. This seem to shake things up, as we asked for napkins, dry and wet, as some splashing was on clothing. The staff seemed to rotate out our server with others to settle their collective nerves, which you would think they would try to provide more service, rather than stepping back a bit with less after the faux pas. But they did give us another replacement glass from another Rose. Fortunately, the glass didn't break. Such is the tight quarters, even on the end table. \n\nPetit Crenn has a decent wine selection for the nature of the food and venue size. There are a dozen By-The-Glass offerings from $13 - $20, including bubbly. In fact, there are perhaps 15 different bottles of Champagne (9) or Sparkling Wine (5) offered, the delineation per the treaty of Versailles.  There are about a dozen+ of each Red and White wines, too, as well as beer. \n\nThe food itself was good for what you are paying. It is based on Dominique's culinary memories from her grandmother's cooking in Brittany, France. So it is a little more casual and Bistro like than a Michelin place. Sort of like the younger sister still living at home, rather than her sophisticated older sister, who has moved to the bright lights and big city.  \n\nSee photos for each dish.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

The service was a bit slow and we seemed to have multiple waiters. The menu was not as communicative, or explicit or as descriptive as I would like. For example, I like to know when a dish is Vegetarian, just a simple \"V\" next to the dish would do, esp. when you have waiters with limited English. \n\nI had the charred peaches; the peaches themselves were excellent but for some reason I didn't care for the intensely goaty goat cheese with the peaches despite the fact that I love goat cheese. \n\nI then had half a mushroom tartine and half a trout tartine, both were good but not really anything extraordinary. \n\nWe ordered pastries for the table mainly for the child with us and struggled to get the descriptions whereby to choose 3 out of 5. I laughed inside and got worried all at the same time when the waiter said one of the pastries had escargot on it...I thought well that doesn't seem likely so I'm going to let that one slide...it turned out to be a snail pastry which in France is probably called escargot but I'm not sure how the description of the there is escargot \"on\" it came about. We asked for the pastries to come out, for the child, before the other food but they didn't bring the pastries until they brought the rest of the food. \n\nI also ordered a bottle of sparkling water. Later that night I see a charge for $14 for water and I'm thinking wow that is an expensive bottle of water. Then I see it was for two bottles, Um...hello...I only ordered ONE BOTTLE. Just because I order one bottle doesn't mean you just keep bringing bottles and pouring bottled waters endlessly without even asking me if I'd like another bottle! Plus only three of us were drinking bottled water. \n\nAlso the receipt charged me for the \"Mission Fig\" instead of the peaches...I guess they were the same price point or something, but I've no idea...I just thought it was a mistake, but let it go without question. \n\nIn the end we couldn't finish all the pastries so I asked for a to-go box...but instead of getting the box as I had asked for, the pastries themselves were suddenly whisked away.\n\nI prefer to box my own food but thought oh well. I later go to the restroom and ask about the pastries to make sure they had understood what I wanted and I was told the pastries were there in back and we be brought out later. After the bill was signed and we were ready to leave still no pastries....which mystified me cuz it was the second restaurant in San Fransisco to keep to-go portions of food from us...so I actually had to send my partner to go ask for them. \n\nLater in the park my partner and I had the pastries and they were quite good but there were no napkins or knifes or anything...so they ended up being finger food. \n\nAll in all some major improvements with service timings and requests need to be worked on.", "author": "Lara K."}

I use quotations because it's not a total comfort spot because there is still an air of elegance but yet atmosphere of hustle and bustle.  There are two seatings so everyone is getting served the same thing at the same time.\n\nThis is the same chef as Atelier Crenn (one of the best dining experiences in SF in my opinion) and she's made this a much homier feel.\n\nIf you don't eat seafood, this isn't the place for you because the substitution for the fish (main dish) is a small plate of mushrooms.  Just a warning.  It should be labeled as a seafood restaurant.\n\nThe best part of the meal was probably the little puff pastry with gruyere cheese and pickled shallot on it. I could eat a dozen of those little things.\n\nMeal started with a huge oyster (I got a little piece of omelette instead).\n\nThen a squash soup that was tasty with uni (i got brussel sprouts instead).\n\nSide dishes of sunchoke mash and brussel sprouts on the stalk came out - very tasty.  I had no idea sunchoke tastes that good.\n\nFish was raw and didn't come off the bone. I was a little surprised the fish was so raw. But when I looked at our neighbors, their fish was perfectly pink and cooked well.  They offer to debone the fish for you at the table (I don't know why you wouldn't say yes!) and they do a good job in general. I think our fish was just too raw.\n\nTimanoix cheese was great.  Never had this kind of cheese and I don't normally like cheese, but this was a highlight.  But I have no idea how to find it again.  It was served on the side of a really bitter salad.\n\nSalted caramel is well, they do it really well!\n\nI wish I could give it more stars but it wasn't an enjoyable meal for me, but it's worth a shot.  Oh they have a chef's tasting for 6 people also that gets slightly different food - the big difference we saw was a huge octopus.\n\nMain reasons why it's not for me:\n- hustle and bustle of the assembly line service and overall rushed feeling\n- tightly squeezed tables make the dining room feel like you're sitting on your neighbors\n- substitution for seafood was limited - I was hungry after nibbling on that little plate of mushrooms. \n- our trout was cooked raw and deboned extremely messily\n\nWhy it's worth a try:\n- I love Atelier Crenn\n- See ^^ but don't feel like an extravagant meal all the time\n- It looks like the seafood is probably good\n- Our trout was cooked poorly (or not cooked) but it looked like other fish were actually cooked well\n- Booking on Resy is easy and awesome.", "author": "Traci H."}

There's an oyster appetizer, a first course of pan-fried gnocchi, and then three things together, the main dish (for us it's the big fish that I forget the name of), a smoked vegetable that is wonderfully bitter and sour with amazing flavor, and baked white beans. Then it ends with a salad, and a dessert. We shared a wine pairing which turned out to be quite good also. \n\nAs you see from what I described, the food isn't fancy. But it tasted very home-style, with top-notch cooking skills, so it's extremely delicious for this style of food. I can see this is sort of an experiment for Chef Crenn, and it seems from the other reviews that people either love it or hate it.

The SO and I came to celebrate our NYE with one of my favorite chefs. We were fairly pleased with our experience and very much enjoyed the quality of the food. When we came back in January, it was clear that the kitchen staff still had a lot they needed to figure out about their own chemistry (will explain later), but in general, given the price and the amount of food we had, it was a great experience. \n\nLike I said, this is a NYE dinner review, so the format of the dinner was probably very different than Petit Crenn proper -- I'm excited to come back on a normal day to try out what the actual experience is like since it seems like there is quite a multitude of review about the quality of that experience. The menu for the night was:\n\nLittle gem salad with dill dressing, house-made pickles and fried oysters\nGougeres with gruyere and pickled shallot jelly\nSt. Simmon Oysters with caviar \nGnocchi\nHen of the wood\nOnion bouillon\nCelery root mash\nLobster \n+apple panna cotta dessert with chocolate and cream and mignardises\n\nI don't know if there is any point in getting into too much details on each dish given that this was a special menu, so here are my high level takeaways. We sat at the bar so it was really interesting to watch the team's dynamic:\n\n-Everything was good. You're definitely paying for that Crenn standard when you come to a place like this\n\n-What was a little disconcerting about my experience was watching them grill our lobster over the flame, and then taking it off, and then while quality checking, realizing that it wasn't cooked and watching them just touch the lobster and put it back onto the flames. Glad they caught it, but no one wants to watch their apparently not cooked food be recooked in front of their own eyes!\n\n-The soup was served out in two different kinds of containers--we noticed a pivot in serving style midway. There was also a weird dynamic between the expeditor and the rest of the team that I think needs to get sorted out so these types of miscommunications and changes don't happen in the middle of service\n\nSo overall, not much to complain about from a tastiness standpoint. It's not Atelier Crenn, but it's also have the price of that, so what did you expect? I definitely don't think it's deserving of its poor ratings so far. Maybe the communal normal style just doesn't work for people?

Turns out, there is a lot! Like the woodfired gluten free bread with house churned butter - a m a z i n g, chewy and dense with nuts and charred bits. \n\nI jumped at the chance to try buckwheat gnocchi with charred corn broth, fava beans and flowering coriander. The gnocchi is piped and boiled to order (in rhythmic style) and the seasonality of the flavours is profound. Next up was fulfilling my fish cravings with pan seared dorade, roasted sunchokes (like potatoey artichoke), thinly sliced corn 'steaks' and fermented scallion relish. Presented like art, and tasted like a well-balanced seafood and vegetable dish. \n\nDessert was salty coconut custard that made use of my favourite berry and the taste of Californian summer - blackberries! I liked the textural touch of granola. \n\nI was dining solo and planned to read a book - but found watching sitting at the bar and watching the chef's cook was much more interesting!

I would totally recommend opting for the wine pairing - adds some fun drinks to the already wonderful meal.\n\nThe restaurant is small (only around 20 seats) in what must have been an old storefront. Music is played on the loud side, but it takes away a lot of the stuffiness that can fill a price fix place like this.

I always have to have at least one proper dinner whenever I go on vacation because let's be real, if you don't do fine dining, are you really living? This was a prix fixe dinner and service was included. If you go to their website it tells you that you do not have to leave gratuity which is very nice. I learned about this after being unsuccessful in getting a reservation at Atelier Crenn. Since I failed to secure the Michelin star rezzies, I had to come to it's sister restaurant.\n\nOur uber driver got lost from Union Square coming to this part of town and then there was SF traffic. The combo was making my blood boil to temperatures where even mercury would melt (356.7\u00b0C, in case you were curious). Finally upon entering the restaurant, we were 13 minutes late to our reservation, our names were checked off on the list in the little black book and we were told to sit at the bar from where we had the view of the live show. We opted for the wine pairing and it was a little underwhelming. Usually I get a bottle or two and have never opted for a wine pairing but the pour just sorta left me astonished, and secondly the lady serving was not very polite. While she was serving one of the bottles she said something like oh if you've ever had that wine then you'd know what I'm talking about in an almost condescending tone. Like ok, fine, we probably haven't had that wine or any of the wines that you are serving but you should not be talking to your customers like that. Otherwise the whole experience was very enchanting and engaging.\n\nThe kitchen staff was working together like the arms of a clock, in perfect harmony. It was like watching a symphony perform with the head chef being the conductor. I won't go into the details of the food as everything was pretty much phenomenal but the only thing that left me wanting a little something more was the dessert. It was a corn based dessert with corn ice cream and just tasted too sweet to me. The macadamia nuts in there were my favorite part.

It's a beautifully filmed documentary style interview of prominent chefs from around the world. When my daughter invited me to SFO for the weekend, I immediately made a reservation for Petit Crenn, a restaurant of one of the Chefs featured on the series. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! Even a simple brunch was fantastically prepared.  This experience began with the most heavenly crispy, intensely buttery chocolate croissant.  There must have been 10,000 layers, all of which ended up on my lips as I was devouring every bite.  Just when you thought there couldn't have been any more buttery goodness, the hit of dark chocolate invaded my palate.  As the chocolate melted in my mouth, I knew this meal was going to be wonderful.\n The quiche was next.  The combination of leeks and chevre nestled in an impossibly flaky crust was a true joy to eat. Each bite was soft and full of flavor.    I also ordered a mushroom tartine, a French version of an open-faced sandwich.  This masterfully designed dish was simple, yet full of amazing depth of flavor.  From the tender mushrooms to the rich tarragon sauce, each bite was a mouth full of silky perfection.  Although I ate alone, the service couldn't  have been better.

I loved Atelier Crenn so couldn't wait to try this new sister restaurant with a different concept. Set menu for $75 with a communal dining experience where you will most be sharing some dishes with people at the same table unless you book your reservation for party of 4+ and the table only fit that many people.\nTwo seating of dinner at 6pm and 8:30pm so it's best to arrive on time to arrive nice pacing of food and adequate time to enjoy the food. Walk-ins are taken at 5pm and you get seated at the counter.\n\nMy husband and I had a 6pm reservation and arrived on time, waited for our other two friends whom had requested to be seated with us. They were a bit late so we had an extra cheese course before they arrived.  Dinner for us ended at 8:15pm where most of the other 6pm tables left and staff are busy preparing settings for the 8:30pm seating. \n\nFood/Drinks- The menu changes so I'm not going to go into detail on each item. My favorite items that night were the oysters (I love oysters) and whole trout. Other dishes were solid and they nicely accommodated some for no dairy. However, for the cheese course with salad, they did not offer me a substitute and no substitute for the nibbles/treats of caramel and chocolates at the end either. It would have been nice to also get something rather than watching others at the table slowly savor those treats. Wine was tasty, good selection.\n\nAmbiance/Decor- brightly lit and nicely decorated yet simple. Two large menus of the day posted on the walls. Seating a by the wall could be a bit cozy especially if you have a large coat or purse as I didn't see any place to store them but by my side.\n\nService/Staff- professional, I wouldn't say they were\nSuper friendly, but nice enough. Quite attentive as they came to check on us multiple times for drinks while we waited for our friends. Dishes came right away one after an other. One waitstaff brought me the dessert with dairy, but caught himself right after he set it down in front of me. He returned with my non-dairy dessert a bit later. \n\nOverall, good place for dinner to have solid/good food and a new dining experience if you sit/share dishes with strangers, which could be fun! Portions are reasonable and I was quite stuffed so boxed part of the trout home to fit in other courses into my tummy. I was already happy before I had any food because I got to shake hands with Dominique. She's so cool! ;)", "author": "Iris H."}

The idea is to give a taste of the real Atelier Crenn but in a more affordable and informal way. only option is tasting menu, at $100 including tip and tax and mid range wine is $100-150 per bottle. For us bill ended up at $150 per head. That's the concept. Not bad. Several problems with execution. \n- The room itself looks like one of those new frozen yogurt shop hastily repainted and furnished. We understand the minimalist idea but this looks darn cheap. \n- out of the 6 courses of the menu, only 2 were up to expectations the fish and an amazing escargot crepe. The rest (amuse bouche, asparagus, fromage blanc and lemon tort) was basic except for the fromage blanc that was sad\n- we may have been unlucky but our main waitress, a nose-ringed snooty woman, seemed mainly interested in upselling us, showing her disapproval when we declined to take the small $80 each caviar supplement for caviar and we asked to share the wine pairing option (5 glasses). \n\nVery honestly this place feels like they're leveraging the Atelier's reputation to make a quick buck, using old up selling tricks and pushy personnel incompatible with the reputation. \n\nRecommendations to restaurant: let the customers decide the tip (at the moment already included following the (bad) French custom - waiters only way to increase revenue is to sell more not have better service ), work on the decor, reduce the number of courses and increase consistency, don't offer supplements as expensive as the menu.

It is clear that the chefs are professional and take their food seriously.  Here is the problem:\n\n- we had the tasting menu, which I know is for \"tasting\" only, so the portions were small.  But after 5 dishes, I walked away hungry.  I admit to loving food, but I'm not an overeater.  I thought I was going to dinner (albeit, consisting of many small dishes).  The food itself was good, with some negatives (more below), but literally, my dinner did not include anything more than one taste.  I'm not going to say that I paid $95 for just 5 tastes, but I did go to dinner, and was expecting to feel at least not tempted to have a second dinner (which I did).  For example, I had the herring with potatoes, it was delicious, but it contained 3 minuscule herring pieces and 5 very small potatoes.  So, in 3 bites, it was over.  I would have liked to enjoy the taste besides just \"tasting\" the dish.  I also had a clam dish, which consisted of 3 baby leeks (looked like the white part of a baby/ thin spring onion) covered with 3 tiny leafs of a plant I am not familiar with, and underneath each leaf, I found a small clam (it was so small, I didn't see it until I moved the leaf).  I understand small dishes, but this dinner was tiny and unsatisfactory for that reason.  The only dish that provided some kind of substantial nourishment was the bread slice with butter, but it wasn't the kind of calorie intake that I was anticipating.  The bread was a brioche style and it was greasy (as all brioches are), and I was happy to finally eat something that required chewing and actual swallowing of food, but I was really disappointed that it had to be bread, which as tasty as bread can be, just isn't actual food.  After all this bashing, I have to say, the food itself was good.  The buckwheat mushroom tart was excellent.  It was the only dish of a decent size, considering it's a small-dish dinner, and it was very tasty.  \n\n- the taste of some foods wasn't ideal.  For example, we had the halibut as the last dish.  Both my husband and I had different reasons for not liking this dish.  I dislike halibut in general, but this one had some sort of cartilage in the middle, and it was overcooked on top and undercooked on the bottom.  It was a big difference in taste and consistency in 1/2 inch of fish.  I'm not sure that halibut is a great fish to eat undercooked, either, it has a really fishy smell that is only exacerbated when it's near-raw.  My husband thought the overcooked part was too heavy.  It was the last dish and the worst of the night.  The desert that followed (chocolate cake) was good and probably one of the heaviest and most copious dishes relative to our dinner, but it was sweet, and I wasn't ready for desert on a hungry stomach. \n\n- the servers were clearly trained in serving tables, and they did a great job on manners/ filling water glasses/ courtesy, etc.  But the restaurant was loud (people talking and laughing, etc), and all servers talked in a normal voice, which was extremely hard to hear.  Especially for an unusual menu like this one, my husband and I barely heard what the servers said each time.  To clarify, we're in our mid-30s, with excellent hearing :)  It was always... \"blah blah... buckwheat.... on a bed of... blah blah... clams... in a sauce of .... blah blah... \"  Very frustrating.  And we genuinely wanted to know what was in our dish, but we just could not hear.  The servers have to speak up more, or the menus may have to be more descriptive in writing.  \n\n- we were offered a few additional dishes to the tasting menu.  It was very unexpected to be provided with a 5-course menu (of course, I didn't know in the beginning that the portions are tiny), and to be told that you can buy 2 more courses at $22 and $45 each extra.  With truffles at $25 extra.  I understand the pricing system, and in retrospect, I wonder if I had bought the 2 extra courses, whether I'd have felt fuller after the dinner.  It was only when dinner was over that I realized that it was small and I was still hungry and the tasting original menu really wasn't a dinner menu at all.  And I felt disappointed with the whole experience.  If it takes 7 small dishes to feel the full experience, then the restaurant should charge $120 per person and provide all food for a complete experience.  I felt like the normal menu of $95 per person was a let-down and that perhaps the restaurant knew that it wasn't sufficient food, which is why they offered those extras.  It just didn't feel like I knew that 5 dishes would not be enough, and I wish all this information had been more explicit so that I can make a choice.  While $95 is a lot already, I would have paid $120, if I had known that it's what it took to feel satisfied with dinner.", "author": "Raley S."}

Petit Crenn, while still a total splurge as far as I'm concerned, makes it possible to eat Crenn dishes for us mere mortals. \n\nWe sat at the chef's counter, warmed by the heat of the massive fires, and were able to watch the immaculate preparation, obsessive cleaning and general attentiveness of the cooks.   There was zero chaos in the kitchen.  It was a show, for sure. \n\nDinner is a  tasting menu and the tastes were substantial enough that we left full. Very full, though we did eat every bite, resisting the urge to lick the plates clean, especially in the case of the crudite and the tomato sauce with the squid. \n\nThe menu is displayed on a chalk board and I strategically left my glasses at home so each course was something of a mystery, which made it fun to try to guess what was in the sauce for the crudite (maybe avocado?)  and what the crunchy bits were (toasted buckwheat). \n\nThe best course was the trout.  Now, I don't usually think of trout as being a robust, fatty fish, but this was, and after we had ours, we watched how it was cooked, very closely, to see if we might be able to re-create the perfection and yumminess at home (I have no idea how they got the skin so crispy and delicious without sticking to the grill or turning black - probably something to do with the temp and distance from the fire....) \n\nI'd definitely like to come back and try another menu.

Our Alsatian white wine, with just a bit of effervescence, was divine.\n\nStaff was very friendly, and with tip included in the price, we left feeling like it is one of the better deals in the City for a very nice night out.", "author": "Jesse H."}

Beware - this place is nothing like Atelier Crenn (nowhere near Atelier's price range either, haha!).\n\nPrix-fixe menu. Started off with raw oysters, two per person, tasted pretty good. Next came a pot of mussels. The mussels did not taste fresh (not-fresh mussels usually have a slight stink to them, and these mussels had that stink), and the garlic bread was burnt along the edges. There was a dish with a full fish (head and bones included) that was difficult to eat and tasted okay. The brussel sprouts on the stock with the sun-chokes dip tasted pretty decent. The salad was bland, the cheese that came with the salad was pretty nasty (don't eat the rind). The dessert, which was a traditional pancake sorta thing, tasted awful and bland. There was too much food, in my opinion, an attempt to make up for the poor quality and bad taste. \n\nAmbiance is a typical, trendy, chic, French bistro style. Service was nice. The seats (bench along the wall) is hard and uncomfortable (pretty much sitting on concrete). \n\nWay over-priced ($79 per person) for mediocre food. Never again. I would not recommend this restaurant. Go to Clementine on Clement if you want good French food (with affordable prices if you do the early-bird special).", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Read below.\n\nMy bf and I were supposed to eat here the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I was in town from LA for the weekend, and he had wanted to try this restaurant for a while now, since it had recently opened, and we've had great experiences at their other restaurant, Atelier Crenn. So, he had booked the reservation 4 weeks to the day through SeatMe, to ensure that we would have a table for this particular weekend. It was to celebrate our 7.5 year anniversary. He had received the email confirmation through SeatMe, a few days before the reservation, and another text message an hour before our reservation. \n\nAll was going well, until we arrived at the restaurant, and it was CLOSED.\n\nWe left 2 phone messages. I gave them until Monday to return my call, since it was Thanksgiving weekend and all. That should have been plenty of time for them to return my call. They never called back to apologize - not to my boyfriend nor me! A week following the reservation, my boyfriend emailed them saying how disappointed we were with our experience. Her response: \n\n\"I am very sorry for the frustration and disappointment that this caused you and your girlfriend. We no longer use Yelp SeatMe as a reservation platform. One of the reasons is because there were frequently mistakes like this.  We have transitioned recently to Resy, which we believe is much more reliable. \n\nI hope that you will consider joining us in the future. If I can ever be of assistance in making a reservation or for anything else, please do not hesitate to contact me directly at ______\"\n\nTo be honest, if they knew that SeatMe frequently makes mistakes, they should be especially careful to prevent these mistakes from occurring!!! I don't know why that had to be their excuse. Or if it was their excuse, restaurant credit encouraging a second visit would be appropriate. This is especially disappointing, since their sister restaurant Atelier Crenn is a Michelin-rated restaurant. One would think that they would have their service down pat. Nope. \n\nThey made it loud and clear that they did not want our business there. Will not be returning.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-17", "description": "I, like others who have reviewed Petit Crenn, had high hopes for this dinner, but alas, while the food was all delicious, the overall experience left much to be desired. Four of us arrived for our 8:30pm seating at 8:32pm and were relegated to sitting at a counter. Normally, I love a counter seat, watching the cooks prepare food, but for an expensive dinner with four people, a counter is not conducive to a good dining experience. First bit of advice: close the counter to anything other than couples.\n\nNext, while the food was really delicious (oysters, mussels on Josey Baker bread, a small bowl of chopped tomatoes, fluke, a salad, some sort of dessert), there just isn't very much of it. And, with two wine pairings (one for each couple to share) and a bottle of wine (more on that), our meal was about $600 (or more, I quickly looked away from the receipt lest my retinas burn out). In terms of value, Petit Crenn simply doesn't offer any. \n\nBack to the wine, we relied on our wine server to find a good accompaniment to the meal. While the wine was ok, it was curious. And, when I asked about it (since I couldn't hear the earlier conversation about the wine selection--see also: counter seating), he described it as an unusual wine. Oh. Why, out of curiosity, are you recommending unusual wines to be paired with your food? Do you know how this works? Second bit of advice: provide actual valuable wine guidance to your patrons. If you think a wine is weird, be up front about it before they order it.\n\nAll in all, we did it. That's about the best praise I can offer for the total dining experience at Petit Crenn. I'd eat the mussels on toast again (hard to give Crenn credit for Josey Baker's handiwork, though). But, I think PC is a one-time event. If I could turn back time, I'd have several meals at Nopa or many other restaurants instead.", "author": "Todd X."}

There are only two seating times, 6pm and 8:30pm. While I like the idea of everyone eating at the same time, it just doesn't quite work. We all eat at different speeds so the people who are quicker end up waiting uncomfortably long for the next course since we are waiting for the people who don't eat as fast. This uncomfortable wait happened several times during our meal. Also being in the first seating, when the next seating group started to arrive, all we got was stares. While I understand what it's like to wait, it's not our fault that the food is coming out slow. \n\nI'm glad they got rid of the communal sharing plates idea. Food is now only shared among your own party. Tables are all two tops, not communal either. \n\nThe service was ok but slow. There were times I think they could have paid more attention to us. I had to ask for water refills several times. \n\nStreet parking in the area can be hard but not impossible.\n\nThere are some extras you can order on top of your set meal.

This may be cliche, but since being moved to tears by Dominique Crenn's episode on Chef's Table, I really wanted to experience one of her restaurants. Sadly, I was met with utter disappointment. \n\nThe restaurant in general isn't very clean and it doesn't have a good feeling. Upon arriving, we were helped by a bunch of people and you would think that would feel nice being tended to by many but instead it felt very disorganized, rushed and unprofessional. Every few minutes, someone different would come to our table and ask how we were doing or if we wanted anything although whatever we asked for never came. Water was spilled on our table and he replied he would come back to wipe it down but he never did. We had to ask a several times for silverware. The towel with which the table was wiped down between courses was dirty. The service just generally felt sloppy. There was one particular waiter who was incredibly creepy. Both my friend's and my radars went off. He seemed drunk or high and was very openly hitting on the women seated behind us. We felt pretty uncomfortable.\n\nThe food...we had the 5 course dinner plus wine pairings. Our bill for two came to ~$350 including gratuity. We left very hungry because the servings are so small!! Each course comes out \"family style\" except it's such small servings it's like you're splitting a meal. The wine pairings were pretty horrible. We did not enjoy any of the wine/champagne served. So much so we left glasses unfinished (and I never leave foods/drinks unfinished because I feel wasteful + guilty). We wished we had just ordered a nice glass of wine of our choice.\n\nLastly, if you do choose to dine here, expect to smell like campfire afterwards. They have an open grill that emits a lot of smoke. I've been to other restaurants with open grills/wood burning ovens and never went home smelling so smoky but after our meal here, my hair and clothes were quite smoky.\n\nWe were still so hungry after our meal here, we went and got tacos.

The restaurant is like walking into someone's living room, bright and welcoming with pillows along the long benches that you sit on against the wall.  We were lucky enough to score a reservation on their first Saturday dinner service to celebrate my friend's birthday.  As soon as we were seated, Chef Crenn came and jokingly asked if we've been there before and then said, of course not since they just opened.  \n\nIf you love vegetables and seafood, you are going to love dinner here. Right at 6:00 sharp, all the tables started being served a few amuse bouche from the kitchen:  an omelet, some anchovies and a wonderful gougeges.  Chef Crenn served a couple of them personally!   We then went right into the first course, oysters with smoked tomato gelee on the half shell.  Bread  and salted butter was brought to the table as well.  Next was escargot, with an Asian inspired onion pancake and mushrooms.  I've seriously never had escargot before, and this was just delicious - great combination of flavors and texture.  Soon arrived the cauliflower au gratin and grilled cabbage.  The sauce with the cauliflower was rich, and yet light at the same time.  I love cabbage so I really was excited to eat a good wedge.  The piece de resistance was the roasted trout, deboned tableside, with a cider sabayon.  It was perfectly cooked, and the lemon really brought out a wonderful taste.  Dinner ended with a light salad and more bread, then nicely transitioned to a light citrus mousse, along with some caramels and cookies.  \n\nAll in all, the service was professional with a slight casual touch.  Even though it was their first week, they were all coordinated in making sure we received the right amount of attention at the right time.  The best part of the night was when Chef Crenn photo bombed my friends while I was taking a picture of them.  She came across as very fun and friendly, as well as proud of her restaurant, as she should be.\n\nI like that the service is included in the prix fixe menu.  Broken down, it's like a 20% tip on a $60 dinner.  I loved the cider we had with dinner, but next time I really need to try something from their wine list.  This is a great place for going out to dinner with a few friends.  If you're pretty social, going out as a couple is good too, but expect to sit with another couple as she really does try to make this like a dinner party atmosphere.  \n\nStart booking those reservations.

Upon entering, we were greeted with a blast of loud music from the 80s. I personally love 80s music, but coupled with all of the chefs and waiters singing, it was a tad too much. We asked to have the music turned down, but they barely reduced it by -1dB. Not exactly the kind of ambiance you expect at a French restaurant. The design of the place was pretty nice with its modern elegance and crazy plastic chairs.\n\nHere's what we tried:\n\nTROUT TARTINE ($15.00) salty smoked trout on top of a large slice of bread topped with a spread of cream cheese and capers. I like harder bread, but this bread was a bit too hard and a tad too burnt. It wasn't super filling or anything special but it was decent. \nGNOCCHI ($22.00) surprisingly soft and melt in your mouth. Some people think it's too mushy--I agree it's not a bouncy as your normal gnocchi, but I actually preferred it. It was seasoned very well with a butter sauce. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. \nMUSSELS MARINIERE ($24.00) a little too much lemon in their sauce but the mussels were fresh and the buttered bread wasn't too bad.\nOMELETTE ($18.00) I don't recommend this dish. It was simple a thin omelette stuffed with cheese and cilantro.  \nPANNA COTTA ($9.00 each) I also don't recommend this either. It was similar to a yogurt parfait with granola and strawberries, but it was super small and not worth it. Go to McDonalds instead if you want a better parfait. \n\nIt's nice that they included the service fee. Tip is always a super touchy issue--not sure if we give enough, feeling bad for waiters, don't want waiters to get mad, don't want people to trip us as we exit the building (I'm kidding of course).    \n\nSERVICE: 4 stars since they refilled our water and changed the plates and utensils.\nAMBIANCE: 3 stars because I wish they turned down the music more even though we already asked.\nFOOD: 4 stars since it wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either.\nPRICE: 2 stars because it's overpriced.\nTOTAL: 3 stars \n\nBottom Line: Food is decent.

I had heard and read a lot of mixed reviews along with my experience at Atelier Crenn I honestly was expecting a let down. Though I enjoyed the experience of her flagship restaurant the flavors didn't really come together for me. Luckily her artistry and the pairing of poetry made that experience one of a kind. \n\nRight out the gate the prices felt very high to me. As much as I was ok with a fixed price menu I was hoping it would be a little more casual. The whole place felt almost too clean and hospital like. In many ways it felt as classy as Atelier just less spread out. I was hoping for parisian and neighborhood like rather than the sterile white. Chairs weren't very comfortable either though I'm sure the bench seating was fine. The service was equally as sterile. Again in hopes of it being a more relaxed casual version of Atelier it felt like it was trying to be more than that. I recall at Atelier our servers were very laid back yet professional. They were another part of what made that experience great and sadly I didn't get that here. They were efficient and timely but just didn't grab me on a personal level. \n\nThe food however is spectacular. Flavors came together really well during our meal and the wines that were suggested to me paired really nicely. Probably the strongest part of the service now that I think about it. The gnocchi was perfect and roasted potatoes were both excellent. I enjoyed the salmon entree though for an 89 dollar I expected a little more flash or better fish. The little gem salad was a bit boring as well. Tasty but a bit of a let down due to expectations and price. \n\nIn the end I can't say I had a bad time but I also can't rave about it either. I had a lot of hopes of it being more casual and it never did that for me. The beauty of Atelier crenn is her personality shows in the all the other aspects of the restaurant and at Petit you don't even get a little of what makes Dominique Crenn so adored by her fans.", "author": "Joco F."}

However I was extremely disappointed with the service. \n\nThe food was very good, but not out of this world, with the exception of the chamomile Panna cotta - which was amazing! There where 3 waiters, 2 woman that had unfriendly attitude and 1 guy that said he had been here for 2 weeks only. We were served last most of the time during the whole night; we ordered a bottle of wine and we had to serve ourselves water and wine during the night because none of the waiters came over to fill our glasses.  The waiters where very unorganized, everyone was trying to do everything at every table and because of that they missed actually Giving service to every table.  We did not get offered more drinks nor coffee. \nI think the concept of the place is good and believe it has potential but they really need to do something about the service.  I did not get a sense of anyone there being happy to be there or do their job. \n\nIf I could rate the food and service separately I would give it 2 stars for service and 4 stars for food.", "author": "Lyndy N."}

From the ambience to the service to the food to the wine, it was absolute perfection. The servers were friendly, attentive, and extremely professional. The interior of the restaurant itself is lovely and seemed to glow that evening; they even had a really cool playlist going in the background which just added to the overall effect. As for the food...the only SF restaurants I've been to with similar quality food are Quince and maybe Benu. Too delicious to even attempt to describe! I highly recommend splurging on the wine pairing, too; the staff did a good job of selecting wines that complemented the food perfectly.\n\nWe came for the 8:30 seating and wrapped up around 11:30pm. We really appreciated the pacing of the meal as it gave us time to savor each course and fully soak up the experience. The bill came to around $315 for two prix fixe meals plus two wine pairings. We felt it was money well spent.\n\n(Side note: I have to say that it's hard to understand how this place could only have 3.5 stars on Yelp.

The food and wine were fabulous. Service was attentive...with one large exception.\n\nPetit Crenn is exactly as the name describes it...SMALL. It's so small that the restaurant has yet to figure out a proper ventilation system. Last night, we had a fabulous meal but we could have been sitting by a campfire in Yosemite for all we knew. We. Got. Smoked. Out. The smoke was so bad that all of our clothes had to go straight to the washer and our hair still smells after taking showers.\n\nNow, if it was a one-off smoke show, it would have been understandable, but our table, the table next to us, and the table next to them complained. The server merely brushed it off and started telling us about the amaze wood-smoked grill they have. Our eyes were burning at one point and when we told them, they simply opened the front door.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't expect this from a BBQ joint let alone a fixed price $100pp fine dining restaurant.

Gougeres, mussel tartine, incredible fluke, pumpkin vichyssoise and pumpkin and buckwheat crepe (so good) to name a few. We ordered a bottle rather than the pairings, as they would have made our dinner insanely expensive. Very warm environment and we got to watch the sous chef et al neatly pack and put things away. Also, the cooks all clean and meticulously scour their areas, which is how it's done in France - this is a HUGE plus for a restaurant in contrast with here where night cleaners come in and the cleaning us not as good, plus there is less of a whole body involvement on the part of the cooks - these details make a big difference.

We were the 2nd party to arrive for an 8:30 seating on a Friday night and once seated we kept waiting to be asked for our drink orders while pretty much most others around us were served their drinks. There was just a lack of warmth and willingness with the service. \n\nThe wine list is quite French but probably a much better experience if done as a food pairing. The by glass burgundy Pinot noir I ordered tasted a bit acidic and old probably not corked well.\n\nFood - conceptually I loved the idea of a pre frix menu served in family style plates even for tables of 2. The first couple courses were ok - oysters (berry mignonette a bit too sweet), gougeres were tasty, charred corn gnocchi was probably the tastiest dish of the night. Then it went downhill. The bass was the main course and probably the most disappointing. They  brought out the whole fish while the first course was being served but it took over 30 minutes for the fish to be served after everyone had finished the 2nd course of gnocchi. Fish was really dry, chalky and overcooked which was a pity given a potentially  high quality ingredient. The carrots were rubbery. Potatoes w Gorgonzola didn't taste bad. Dessert was too bland and blah didn't really care for the chocolate dust. \n\nI am not sure I will be returning but if forced to come back it will to order an ala carte meal and will bring my own bottle of wine.", "author": "Cookie M."}

This was a big splurge for us, but figured it would be worth it because we love seafood and French cuisine.   Everything was pretty delicious, except... the halibut was the most overcooked fish I've ever eaten in my life.   It was as hard as a brick and dry as sawdust.   We did have the tail piece, but, there is no excusing the amount of cook on this fish.   It was just such a disappointment, given the amount of attention that is spent showing the fish to the guests, and allowing us to watch it be prepared.  We also saw them packing away extra pieces, so, clearly they could have re-fired a piece if they saw it went over.    I did not mention it at the table because I didn't want to create an awkward situation for the special occasion. \n\nI would have also sent a private email to Petit Crenn, but I emailed (and called, and left voicemails) in the three days prior to my reservation to ask about corkage fees and no one ever followed up or responded to me.

It is clear from the decor that the food is meant to be the star. And, at Petit Crenn, it is.\n\nDominique Crenn now mans (womans?) the front of the house, while Aaron Thayer, previously sous chef at Atelier Crenn, minds the stoves. The prix fixe menu ($72) concentrates on the freshest of vegetables and shellfish, and there are two seatings per night (6:00 and 8:30).\n\nElegant without being ostentatious, the parade of dishes started with goug\u00e8res, baked savory choux pastries filled with creamy sheep's milk cheese. Lighter than air, they were delicious. Next came briny miyagi oysters topped with smoked tomato gel\u00e9e. Escargots bathed in mushroom broth and garnished with chanterelles follow.  Earthy, yet light, the dish is a winner. A roasted trout, unfortunately served whole, was flaky and moist. Cauliflower gratin with smoked breadcrumbs was lush and rich. Dessert is a tangy orange and Meyer lemon mousse piped into the peel of a large orange. Cool.\n\nIn an interesting switch, servers rotate from kitchen to table, presenting dishes they have prepared. In general this works, except when a junior server is tasked with the complex task of denoting a whole fish. Right spirit, not-so-great execution. Other that this one slight mis-step, servers are pleasant and seem honestly interested in guest enjoying themselves.\n\nThe wine list has ample selections by the glass and by the bottle.  Not surprisingly, it focuses on French offerings: Burgundies, Bordeaux, and Champagnes are all represented. Well-priced for The City, it offers something for everyone.\n\nIn a city with many choices for fine cuisine, Petit Crenn is a must try. And, and must return.", "author": "CJ G."}

They came to take a drink order very quickly, and were nice enough to split a wine pairing for us, which was great because we didn't each want a full pairing. \n\nThe first thing to come out was some seriously sublime sourdough from Josey Baker Bread. Nice thick slice, crunchy, chewy, melty house-buttery, it was everything you could want from a piece of bread. \n\nNext was a delicious fluffy omelette with a bit o' Humboldt Fog cheese and veggies in it, along with some puff-pastry type thing, that I can only describe as a sweet and slightly cheesy ball of heaven on Earth. \n\nThe third course was gnocchi. Oh boy, the gnocchi. This might have been the highlight of the meal. Fresh corn, hen of the woods mushrooms, and a creamy sauce that just wouldn't quit, I would trade a Heady Topper and my first born son for another bowl of that stuff. Really delightful. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the main course was pretty great too. The fish (which they brought out on this massive platter to show everyone before cooking it) was perfectly cooked. The carrots it was served with were also delicious. The bean salad wasn't the most flavorful thing in the world, but it was fresh and complemented the fish nicely. After this, I was full. But I kept eating, it was all delicious: the rest of the meal was a blur of little gems salad, an eclair, and some tasty little candies at the end. \n\nOverall: Great food, nice wine pairing (grain of NaCl: I don't know squat about wine), friendly attentive service, and all for a very reasonable price.

We had a reservation so the server seated us promptly and ordered our drinks soon after. Unfortunately - aside from the intermittent and welcome breaks in the gnocchi, lobster soup, omelette, and roasted trout that are absolutely fantastic - the service in general was slow and unfriendly. \n\nWe waited at least 20 minutes before someone came by to take our orders (after we got our drinks) and only after we repeated looked over suggestively. The server quickly takes our menu *as we are still ordering*, even though planned to ask for recommendations since we are looking for a heavier meal than other clients. She grabbed it, assuming that we didn't want more, and started to walk away. I know you might be understaffed but there's no reason to rush your service.\n\nOur first course came a bit later than expected - but the saddest part is that it came just a few minutes before the first course on the table next to us - who came after we got our drinks. It was quite disappointing, to say the least.\n\nThe final straw is in the under-cooked roasted trout. The kitchen staff came out to de-bone the fish and it was clearly raw along the belly. We usually cook it medium, he says. But I didn't want to take my chances, so I asked him to cook it some more - no hard feelings there. When he came back, he dropped off the fish, complete with sauce, and quickly turned away. I get it you're understaffed - really had no hard feelings. A smile or an assurance wouldn't hurt, you know? I didn't leave feeling satisfied to say the least.\n\nSo, if you have some time on your hands and want to enjoy good food - this is a good place to go.

But sometimes when your expectations are super high, the reality disappoints more than when you had mediocre thoughts going in. \n\nWe had a reservation which meant the tasting menu and we decided to add two extra items from the a la carte menu. Those two extras (scallops and uni) were the bright spots of the night. Mussels were meh, not unique or creative, but I guess you could tout that as being traditional. The rest was good but not stand-out, which I would expect at these price points and the chef's klout. \n\nIf you're going to go with a reservation, go with more than 2 people because there is a serious portion problem--Brittany food is pretty heavy and their idea for family-style for two people is far over what one could/should eat. For example, we were served a mountain of sunchoke mash as a side. And that was with a whole brussel stalk and a whole fish too. I'm not sure if it's a Brittany tradition to serve salad so late in a meal, but that's what they do here and it feels awkward and misplaced. \n\nI'm not sure I would go out of my way to go back, but if we happened to walk by and there were openings at the counter it might be worth a peek to see what you could order a la carte so you wouldn't have to commit to the tasting menu.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I suppose it's true to the marketing, it is the type of meal I might imagine a French mother to prepare, but for $200, I expected more refinement and creativity.

I ordered a single oyster to taste, and it was served with the most amazing sweet and salty elderflower syrup, and a charred lemon half on the side. Such an interesting combination, and a perfectly delicious mouthful! Next, we split the trout tartine - fresh, rich fish atop a thick slice of crusty bread, with an amazing spread in between. So, so good. For our main course we chose to share the seasonal gnocchi. The house made pasta was incredibly light and airy. Probably some of the best I've ever had. It was served with corn and mushrooms in a delicious rich and buttery broth. Each spoonful was incredible, and because it was so decadent the single dish was more than enough for the two of us.

The food was certainly not bad, and most of the dishes were enjoyable enough, but really nothing came close to being a stand-out...perhaps the escargot came close with it's interesting preparation, but this was counterbalanced by moderately dry and plain fingerling potatoes and undercooked Brussel sprouts accompanying the main course of nicely cooked whole trout (but unlike mentioned in previous reviews, was not expertly deboned and lead to constant picking of small bones out every bite of the dish). The oysters were fresh and nice appetizer, and the salad was good, but similar to a nicely prepared home salad with a cheese crisp. The dessert mouse was a nice typical French dish, but was a bit too creamy and needed more citrus flavor and acidity. The mignardises composed of a little butter cookie and housemade caramel was quite good at the end of the meal.\n\nThe service was amiable, but seemingly a little disjointed and inattentive. Multiple plates were dropped, and pacing was definitely on the slow side between courses. My small water glass stayed empty for quite a while each time I finished it (3 times total during the meal) with no one around for a refill, and the last time I finished the glass remained empty for the last 2 courses and remaining 25 minutes of the meal.\n\nThe wine list was quite reasonable and of good quality, with many ciders to choose from, but surprisingly contained no dessert wines.\n\nBottom line is that if the price of the meal was about $20 less per person, I would think it a better value, but for 2 prix fixe meals and 3 glasses of wine for $210, I expect a higher level of service, refinement and execution.", "author": "Evan B."}

It wasn't your ordinary grill mark, we are talking about full on BURNT fish skin that makes the fish bitter to taste. after the main course, we were then served another small salad to share and finished up with chocolate creme and petit pastries for dessert. the whole food experience was less than memorable, the only memorable moment was how burnt and bitter the fish was when i was eating it. \n\ni would've given this place a 2 star, but the wine pairing was actually a good job so 1 more star for the wine, the rest was totally a miss.\n\nfor the star chef trying to open a casual bistro thing nowadays, no one can beat corey lee with his benu and monsieur benjamin gig, if you are looking to come here hoping to get a glimpse of how it would be like to eat at the her 2 star place, forget it, you are better off going over to hayes valley to corey lee's bistro.", "author": "Joyce C."}

I am a big fan of Dominique Creen's work at Atelier Crenn (which gets 5 stars for me), so I had big expectations for the place. \n\nI enjoy the concept of a communal dinner served by the cooks. The tasting menu of the day was well balanced. Oysters were delicious and the preparation was subtle. \nMussels were good, but it was probably the most simple item on the list (at least for a French person). \nThe trout was perfectly cooked, with a special mention to the carrots side. \nCheese was interesting, the salad was a bit too big - or the cheese portion was too little. But again, I'm French so my cheese consumption is maybe not standard. \n\nThe dessert was the least impressive: it was an apple far (traditionnally we make it with plums). It was pretty basic, and I would have put more apples. \n\nThe service was good and the waiters were definitely nice, but there was room for a few improvements. We were sitting in a corner, and we have had to ask for water at least 4/5 times (we were constantly skipped). When trying my glass wine, the bottle was really too cold. The waitress was really nice; she agreed with me and went to open another bottle. \n\nThe atmosphere is great. I would say that the music is maybe slightly too loud, but I liked the decoration and the open kitchen. I chatted a bit with the cooks at the end of the dinner, really friendly people. The brigade is actually quite young. \n\nPrice was definitely reasonable, and it's nice to see that some restaurants try to get rid of the terrible US-tipping system. \n\nOverall, I think that Petit Creen will eventually get a Michelin Star. As a French person, the cuisine was not really over creative (especially if you compare it with Dominique's work at Atelier Creen), but I can see how it would appeal to Americans. \n\nI would happily go back.", "author": "Lionel F."}

There was a lady with bright red lipstick who did not smile at any point. We were afraid to ask for anything and hoped our busy server looked over at us.

And to our surprise, Dominique was present and serving the diners!\n\nThe restaurant itself is small and simple, but it fits with the theme. White on white, stark and clean. There are two seatings nightly, at 6 pm and 8:30 pm. We arrived 10 minutes early for our 8:30 pm seating and saw the staff effortlessly transition from one seating to the next. \n\nDinner is preset so no thinking is required. They were able to accommodate a gluten allergy as well. You start off with a few delicious bites then the courses come out. Each table is served the same dish at almost the same time. The servers manage to do this very well!\n\nThe menu is available online so I won't repeat it. But the trout is to die for. It is vegetarian fed so does not taste like mercury or dirty as fish sometimes does. The dessert was a citrus creme served inside an orange. Delicious!  We could not finish everything-- the portions were plenty and there were so many offerings!\n\nDinner is $72, gratuity included. The selection of French wines was good and affordable as well. \n\nI can't wait to come back and dine at the bar where they offer a la carte options.", "author": "K V."}

I didn't have a lot of expectations but it definitely surpassed any I arrived with. \n\nWe walked in a bit earlier than their second seating of the night and were immediately greeted and and offered a table. The space is clean, spare and inviting. I somehow felt transported to LA or NY. \n\nThe dinner began with several delightful amuse bouche including local anchovies prepared exquisitely using the chef's grandmother's recipe and served by Dominique herself. The olive oil left after savoring them was so delicious we insisted on using it for the bread that was brought to us with its own scrumptious butter. \n\nSome of my other favorites from the meal were:\n\n-local trout cooked simply and to perfection which Dominique de-boned for us at the table\n-cabbage with vinegar and French onions which was a meld of the most satisfying flavors ever\n-abalone and carrots in a memorable wine reduction\n\nThe concept is a single menu of several courses, which often I find is too much food. I didn't feel that way at Petit Crenn. \n\nTheir pricing policy is European inspired wherein the 5 course prix fix menu includes service charges (so no tipping necessary). \n\nI will definitely return and in the meantime urge friends to try it!!!", "author": "Sandy G."}

Having eaten recently at two of the best prix fixe restaurants in the world - Tetsuya in Sydney and Del Posto in NYC - we were really happy to find an outstanding experience at Petit Crenn for a completely reasonable price, all things considered. Our total check was $260 (tip included) with 2 bottles of wine for a 7 course meal where every dish was classy, expertly finished, and delicious. And paced perfectly - often a sore point with prix fixe. \n\nHonestly, I don't know why more restaurants don't use this business model. The two seatings and fixed menu allow the kitchen to totally control food costs, and lets the chef design a meal where each dish complements the other. \n\nAtmosphere is genial. Petit Crenn is a very comfortable space despite the minimalist decor and the staff does a good job of walking the line between being formal and inviting. Petit Crenn is pretty loud, and a bit bright for our liking. But the crowd was young, lively, and well-dressed, which is refreshing in a city that favors ironic t-shirts and North Face sweaters. Not being snobby here, just prefer a respectful attitude when having an excellent meal. \n\nIt's a new restaurant so the little service gaffs are acceptable. Dominique Crenn is a pro and I'm sure she'll get her staff dialed in. She graciously introduced herself to guests and thanked them for coming. She says the menu is based on her grandmother's recipes, which if true makes her grandma one hell of a badass cook.

Ahem, but aside from that, the food and service is great! \n\nHeres what to expect when you come in, the tabletop are at max 36 seatings(I tried counting) not including chef's table? There is no menu so its very simple because everyone is given a family style tasting menu. The whole entire food is 72 bucks (thats including service) but not tax and wine. I thought it was worth it because of the food itself. Their wine selection is pretty nice too, ranging mostly in France but an affordable price. \n\nThe food itself is pretty simple. \n1. Oysters(depending on the catch of the day) I had the miyagi, but it seems that its always filled with the smoked Tomato Gelee. \n2. Chanterelle broth - very savory, Its simple, but the flavor profile is very good. \n3. Cauliflower Gratin with Smoked breadcrumb- I liked it. I thought the dish itself is very simplistic because its just a gratin, but i understood why they chose this dish, simply cause of the concept. \n4. Grilled Cabbage! Yum I love cabbages so this is what I like most. \n5. Whole Trout. Cooked at medium rare so everything is so soft and melts in your mouth. \n6. Citrus Mousse - Simple, a little bit acidic but refreshing. \n7. Mignardise - Butter cookies, truffles and Caramels, simple to make but they are drops of heaven! \n\nEverything was really good here, but the only thing i would comment is the spacing.

To be fair, I'm comparing it to Le Balafon in Dinard, so kind of hard to impress me after spending time in Brittany. Its almost as good as the everyday bistro food there. Of course there its just regular food not some example of a nearly impossible code to crack. Strange that normal french food done in the US is put on such a pedestal. But, I admit, it was good. Like, 23 euro in St Malo good. \n The ambiance however is ridiculous. Its like the guys from A Clockwork Orange were told to make a sterile set for a 80s sci fi movie. The room is cacophonous and the service frazzled and confusing. The staff was not impolite at all. It just felt like many things were hindering our ability to relax and converse. The super bright lights and white...well almost everything didn't help.\n Hip, slick and or trendy will never impress me. The money wasted on design should have gone to the fundamentals of service. I ran into this kind of thing all the time time back east.

My absolute favorite was the dessert, though I'm not usually a sweet fan.  My weakness is citrus, and the orange mousse was lick the bowl (orange rind in this case) good. \n\nSo why 4 rather than 5 stars? The wine pairings (two of which were not wines but ciders).  Two of the pairings were just way off (one red wine and the first cider), and the others were just OK, nothing that made you think, \"wow, that was an amazing combo\", and as mentioned, two of them we left unfinished.

ITS FINALLY OPEN. \n\nWarning: I may be slightly biased because I absolutely love Dominique Crenn and have followed her everywhere. \n\nFor those of you who just haven't been able to try Atelier Crenn due to its extreme price (I feel you all..), I think this is a great alternative to try Crenn's cooking. The atmosphere and the purpose behind this restaurant is still different from Atelier Crenn (Petit Crenn is much more casual, vibrant, and open), but you can definitely find similarities in the quality and seasonality of the local ingredients she loves to use in all her cooking. \n\nThis place is still pretty expensive for an average dinner ($72/person), but it's a great glimpse into what Crenn offers and it's honestly a very filling dinner. I won't go into all the dishes that were offered (menu changes seasonally anyways), but I have to say that the trout was probably my favorite dish of the night, and even though the menu says it's a 5-course menu, there quite a bit of amuse bouche-like plates that come out as well. The environment is lively and everything is meant to be family-style, so don't come here looking for a quiet, intimate space to have a formal dinner at (that's what Atelier Crenn is for). I came with a friend, and we shared a 4-person table with another couple, where we had to share certain dishes/sides that came out as part of the courses. Given that, if you don't feel comfortable sharing tables and dishes with other people, you should plan on coming here in a group of 3+ people. \n\nI absolutely love the interior, the open space, and positive family-like attitude that everyone, including the staff, has once inside the restaurant. The service was also great but again, it could easily be my biased opinion (I came on opening day, so Dominique Crenn was present and helping to serve tables - first of all, fangirling really hard; second of all, of course service is going to be amazing if she's there watching everything; and third of all, the fact that she served customers herself as a 2-michelin star chef shows how down-to-earth, caring, and overall awesome she is, which deserves a star on its own)\n\nI could keep going on about this place, but I'm just going to end this review with the fact that I WILL be back again ... if I can get a reservation because reservations are pretty filled up for the next 30 days already.

The oyster...the orange zest actually stuck in my mind so it was ok.  The toasted bread...you'd think huh...but amazing bread.  The main was a halibut with a side of beans and roasted carrots...absolutely amazing sides.  The fish looked overcooked, but once it hit the palate it was delicious.  We were pretty much stuffed at this point.  Now the lowpoint: the salad with some dill dressing.  This taste was in my mouth all night, and pretty much what was most remembered in the meal because it was such a miss.  A tasteless bland salad that neither of us finished.  The desert was a light cream custard or something...it was ok, a bit light and refreshing, not a bam in your face decadent desert.  \n\nSo all in all the dinner was nice.  Not knowing the price, I'd go back and glad I experienced it. \n\nThe atmosphere.  Ugh, the all white interior felt like I was in some hoity toity store that thought they were better than they are.  It felt very pretentious, and not welcoming whatsoever.  It was my first observation when walking in the door.  Most of the staff was nice, but one had a perma bitch face as if she just hated her job. I'm sure if she lived in NYC or LA, she would be re-calibrated.

Nothing was bad, but there was a general lack of precision and I felt more like the kitchen was still working things out. \n\nFirst course we're oysters. Fresh. Tasty. But almost ruined with a sweet mignonette. I thought it was ok, but wished I'd had some lemon juice to add an acid note. My date actively disliked it. \n\nNext were mussels that were really quite boring. Not enough flavor and although not bad, I could have done much better at home. \n\nThe laughable dish was a large portion of mashed sunchokes.  Tasty yes, but not very digestible.  They also served roasted Brussels sprouts that were roasted on the stem for dramatic effect. More style than substance if you ask me. They were good. But paired with the sunchokes I wondered why they would double up on two gassy vegetables. \n\nThe next course was a whole grilled fish. I thought it was odd that the larger tables got an entirely different fish than the tables of two. Our neighbors had a flounder. We had a cod of some kind, which was a little over cooked and too salty for my taste. \n\nSadly, my favorite thing was the green salad that followed with thinly sliced persimmon. The greens were super fresh and it had a very light vinaigrette. \n\nThe dessert was a dense and pasty mess. Supposedly a Normandy apple tart.   Not sure if the traditional Normandy tart is as dense and tasteless as this, but I sure hope not!  \n\nThe dessert was a dense pasty disaster. A \"Normandy style\" apple tart. Dense. \n\nI left feeling very full. But not in a satisfied way. I won't be rushing back here soon.", "author": "Priscilla C."}

The food was everything. The showmanship of the fish throughout the restaurant including the sourcing explanation was unforgettable. The amount of food was way more than enough and above my expectations. Along with the dessert and candies to end the meal. Dominque Crenn  herself came to our table to greet us and see if everything was good while making small talk.

I am shocked at the low ratings from other Yelpers!  \n\nThe cuisine is from Brittany (Bretagne) in France, so seafood centric, because that's what they eat in Brittany.  The menu is set for the day -- which might not appeal to the person who wants to 'customize' every single item they order.  However, if you let them know about food intolerances/sensitivities when booking, they will accommodate gladly.  (We let them know about the gluten-free thing and they were able to modify seamlessly).  (if you have a seafood allergy, you may wish to choose another place).  Do let them know ahead though.  The woman next to me had about a million rules about gluten this and dairy that -- she hadn't notified them in advance and she also had 'just a little taste' of everything her date had, including the beer and a bite of bread.  (Please don't do that.  It's gotta be so discouraging to the chefs who take careful measures to ensure they don't sicken people with real food intolerances).  \n\nSince the menu IS set for the day -- what you're going to get is the best of the market, the best of the season, in a focused, delicious preparation.  It's not exactly a cheap night out but it's really a great value at this price point.  I totally recommend it.", "author": "Jaina S."}

I was excited to dine at this restaurant having seen the episode of Chef's Table that features Dominique Crenn.\n\nEach course was full of interesting, light, summer flavor and the presentation was gorgeous.  I had no idea that a simple piece of bread with butter could taste so good.  The oyster was delicious and my favorite course was the Parisian gnocchi. My friend and I both agreed, however, that the fish entr\u00e9e was good without being great, in part because it was slightly overcooked. Honestly, that didn't bother me so much because the experience of the meal was so enjoyable - a culinary story well narrated and timed perfectly.  It was a charming touch that the kitchen staff brought the fish (from Boston) out to the dining room to show everyone what (or whom) we'd be eating later on.\n\nThe staff were welcoming and attentive, and the text message updates were appreciated.  I got a reminder about my reservation and even a follow-up message asking about any dietary restrictions.\n\nI would certainly go back and I'd love to visit Atelier Crenn... but that's a different tax bracket altogether!  I don't normally spend this much on dinner but I think it was definitely worth it.  The ambience was lovely - a light dining room that wasn't too noisy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-18", "description": "I hate to provide the first bad review, but here we go.\n\nI absolutely loved the food at Atelier Crenn so I was really excited to dine at Petit Crenn. The price tag isn't low, but Atelier is so excellent I assumed it would be worth it.\n\nThe big problem began right as we arrived. When they say the food is served family style, they mean it -- there were only two of us hoping for a romantic dinner, but they forced us to sit at a table for four, with another couple, and split the food with them.\n\nBefore sitting down, we asked to be sat at our own table: we pointed out that there were open seats at the bar and open seats at other 2-top tables. The host said we couldn't sit at the bar because it was reserved for walk-ins nor at the 2-top because it was reserved for the 8 pm seating, even though we were there for the prior seating. Neither of these really made sense -- I'm forced to sit at a table because I made a reservation, so they are basically holding my cancellation fee hostage so they can force me to sit at a worse table? And the table that we would vacate before the next seating began we couldn't sit at because then they'd have to bother to reset it? We asked the host to just have our own table, as would happen at any other restaurant, but the host assured us there was simply no other option than to share a table even though there clearly was. And the host was totally unapologetic about it, even condescending to us that we needed to open our mind to try out this different way of doing things. Apparently this is part of the experience.\n\nAs expected, sitting right next to another couple and sharing food with them was supremely awkward and made it difficult to hold a conversation at all. I kept bumping elbows with the stranger next to me and couldn't focus on a conversation with the person I was having dinner with because a stranger was talking (at a totally normal volume) 6 inches from my left ear. It gets extra hard to hold a conversation because the restaurant is just loud enough that there's background noise, but quiet enough that it didn't drown out the stranger sitting right next to me, so all I could think about was the words he was saying.\n\nIn summary, it would have been easier to hold a conversation at a Burger King than it was at this restaurant.\n\nThen there were all the little things that added up to be extra annoying: they don't serve tea; they charged us for the wrong wine; the wait staff kept bumping into me; the serving utensils didn't match the food so dinner was difficult to serve out of their family style serving containers; they served the four of us in joint vessels instead of splitting eminently splittable food like salads into two dishes for the two parties at the table.\n\nNot at any point did the staff give any indication that they genuinely wanted us to have a good experience; the vibe consistently before, during, and after the meal was that it was a privilege for us to spend our money and time there and we should appreciate the uniqueness of the uniquely bizarre and uncomfortable reality they had created for us.\n\nThe food was fine. I would rate it average quality for a restaurant with $15 entrees, not a $72 tasting menu. Unremarkable. Nothing that interesting or that great-tasting or presented that well; just fine food that we could have cooked at home for a lot cheaper.\n\nWalking out, my dinner companion and I exchanged glances and let out a sigh of relief because we could finally release the stress we were feeling throughout the dinner because of all the awkwardness and strangeness of the meal.\n\nThe ice cream was good. But not so good that I'd endure that experience again. I certainly wouldn't pay $72 to do so; you'd have to pay me that.", "author": "David B."}

The wood grill and the small space give it a cozy feel, but the overall vibe is elegant. The grill made it a tiny bit smoky to which I'm normally sensitive but it didn't bother me. Staff was tight- all trained professionals, but we particularly loved watching the prep chef behind the bar (young Asian guy) who was incredibly precise but so calm and focused on his work.  \n\nI am not a salad person- save it for the bunnies.  But the buttermilk dill dressing was something I'd return for specifically.  The gnocci with peas was delicate but had layers of flavor- the chef explained how they used the pea shells to make stock etc.  And the deconstructed cheesecake, while not the most innovative, could not be argued with.  \n\nThe wine list was surprisingly reasonable for a place like this and we had a bottle of Sauv Blanc for under $60.

I got a text message asking about any food allergies or dislikes the day of our reservation. The location and venue are really nice we loved this place when it was Bar Jules the venue is small enough that it doesn't get loud. The food is vegetarian and fish which is my food preference anyways. Not all of the dishes blew me away but every course had a great standout. The main course was yellowfin tuna which they brought around to show everyone before filleting and claimed it was caught in Baja the day before and shipped next day air to SF. The oysters, fish and a vegetarian gnocchi dishes were my personal favorites. Dessert was disappointing the night we were there. Portions were generous you will leave full and satisfied. \n\nBecause its prefix the only items to order are drinks. We didn't get the drink pairing there were 5 courses and I cannot handle 5 rounds of drinks on a Tuesday anymore. Their beer selection was terrible. There was an expensive french beer and the other option on the menu was verbatim \"the champagne of beers from Milwaukee\" which I assumed was Miller High Life. I was disappointed there were no beer options and found it pretentious that they clearly just don't want people ordering beer and how they went about it.

The ambience is super cute, and I love the white and wood decor, which was very clean and simple yet warm and comfortable.\n\nSince it was a soft opening, the front of the house was still ironing out a few service things such as explaining certain dishes and telling the stories behind them.  Each dish is supposed to have special meaning from chef Crenn's childhood, which gives the menu more meaning.  However, having chef Crenn drop by our table made up for everything right away.\n\nWe started out with some items that were communal with the table adjacent to us (well our tables were basically put together into a 4 top). I was a little caught off guard since I knew it was family style, but family style usually implies you share with your own group?  I think it would have been nice if they had set the expectations for the meal in the beginning, such as which dishes would be communal, etc. \n\nAmuses: shared with the table next to us\n1. Radishes: to be eaten with butter and sea salt. This was not clear to us when the radishes and butter were set down separately, so I'm glad someone asked about the butter.\n2. Gougeres: mini, filled with a tangy creamy cheese\n3. French omelette: kind of like an herbed version of tamago - super smooth and silky and wonderful in texture. I wish we had more of this!\n\nFood: \n1. Sweet water oysters: Each part of 2 got 6 sweet water oysters. The oysters were fresh and served on a bed of kelp, topped with tomato gelee. The tomato gelee was definitely the highlight \n2. Escargot: I usually don't like snails due to the sliminess, but theirs were cooked quite well and tasted more like clams in texture. I loved the mushroom broth and wish there were more. There was also a mushroom galette, which had good flavor, but it was a bit soft yet dry in texture and was a bit awkward. These came in individual bowls.\n3. Cabbage: shared with the table. The cabbage was cooked down nicely and had a refreshing vinaigrette \n4. Broccoli gratin: shared with the table.  The cheesy creamy broccoli with a butter and breadcrumb crust was totally comfort food and tasted amazing.  This is best eaten hot.\n5. Fire roasted trout: perfectly cooked with an amazing wood fired flavor, personally deboned table side by chef Crenn (!!). We got lucky since most other tables had other servers deboning it. The trout was pretty big for the 2 of us.  It came with a cider sabayon, and I wish there were more of it!\n6. Little gems: a nicely dressed light salad in the end, shared with the table. It also came with some bread, which was good in flavor but not as crusty in texture as i had hoped.  It also came with a small wedge of cows milk cheese from Brittany made by monks \n7. Valencia orange granita over a mousse: this was beautiful and served in the orange. The granita was light and refreshing, while the mousse was richer. I personally loved the granita and wished there were more of it\n8. Mignardaises: the butter cookie was really good, and I wished there were more. There was also a chocolate truffle and a house made caramel.\n\nIt's $72 including tip (but not tax).  They have a very French focused wine list, as well, with quite a few real champagnes.   We ended up getting various wines by the glass. I wonder if they could have done a wine pairing at request?\n\nAtelier Crenn is one of my favorite places, so I was excited to have a less formal and more seafood focused menu.  Portions were good, and we were pretty full, but since the food was relatively light, I didn't leave feeling gross.  Meeting chef Crenn was a pretty awesome surprise - she was so charming and personable.  Overall, everyone was pleasant, and the back of the house did well with timing considering this was a soft opening.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

And I guess you can say it was all due to first impressions.   As This was advertised as a neighborhood place that is like \"coming home\" at least to paraphrase, I felt so Unwelcomed at the start.  My impression was this was the neighborhood joint to pop into.  Suffice to say, we had a reservation and showed up 40 minutes early.  And we found out the friendly neighborhood joint did seating and made it none their problem to let us stand in the corner without much ado.  Then more folks started coming in while 7 tables were cleared and empty.  And then folks got sat at the bar all while we had checked in...waiting.  The staff was so interested in making the tables neat we were just passed over until we were asked if we would like to sit at the bar for a drink. By then I was so disenchanted with the friendly little bistro the meal was ruined for me.  Here is the deal.  The meal was fine.  Had I felt welcomed, it was still fine.  We had the striped bass aka rockfish.  Guess what, it was flown out from Massachusetts.  I can catch this in Maryland where I live.  Why is a 2 star Michelin chef flying rockfish to California?  And why are we also eating oysters from New Brunswick?  The lack of local protein befuddled me.  And the \"charred potatoes\" we're boiled and under seasoned.  Such a disappointment of a meal from such a high end chef.  Let's also mention that the place is so packed tight my wife kept getting bumped by the waitstaff.  So...the chef who goes to the dock locally and samples local prawns is shipping in rockfish from Massachusetts and the friendly place is so stuffy that you can't buy a seat because the staff is so worried about the next seating.  And there is a fee for reservation cancelation of 85 dollars.  So...though I wanted to leave immediately I had to sit there at a meal about as enjoyable as hanging out with your in laws after you have broken up with their daughter.

Full disclosure--the manager called my husband and comped us for a meal, which we had tonight. I am very happy to say it was a very different and positive experience. I think they took my feedback--and that of others--and made some big improvements. The food was always delicious so that was not the issue. The big issue was lack of communication as to what to expect (since it was really a 3-hour dining experience) as well as a lack of flexibility (Me: \"You are in the middle of the performing arts district and we did not know this was a 3-hour meal. What can you do for us so we can get to our show on time?\" Them: Nothing.) Tonight was lovely and the service was so much better paced than last time. In fact, we got through 7 courses between 6 and 8. Last time we had only 2 small courses between 6 and 7:50. Also we observed that different tables were at different stages of the menu, so they were not being so rigid about everyone having to be on the same course at the same time, which shows much more flexibility. It is so nice when someone listens and makes adjustments to suit customer needs and Petit Crenn has done it. The service now lives up to the promise of the food and I can recommend it highly. I really appreciated the opportunity to try the restaurant again on their dime and I will definitely go back. But I would still not plan to go before a show--it is just too tight for multi-course meal. Take your time and make a night of it.", "author": "Sharon G."}

In a time in SF when everyone is making their restaurants to hyper cool one gets to just relax at PC. You can take in the very modern clean design and get into the perfect art, tile, etc or bc its so stylistically subtle one can just settle into it without even noticing much of anything but the feel of the place and of course, the food.  \nWhen you walk in someone welcomes you. Ive been twice, takes me two times to get a sense of places, and once it was Chef Crenn. I was taken aback but suddenly realized that she was so casual, inviting and normal!  It was sorta sweet and I could feel what she meant when she said in some press thingie a few months ago that she wanted it to be like her home. She is there as though she has had you over to hang out. She deboned our trout at some point and engaged with us as though wed known each other for years...You can see she is enjoying the personal element of the space...which was fun to watch.\nThe food is deceptively simple. Youll eat it as though its simple cafe food and then it creeps up on you, and as we found, and you start talking to your dinner guests about what is actually going on. I had the omelette both times and on first taste its easy to think its just an omelette however after a few bites you realize no its not just an omelette rather its Chef Crenns omelette and its excellent!\nThe other standouts are the oysters, the cheeses(that arrive during the meal which is very fun), the salad which comes in a tall bowl, the tomato salad...which is perhaps the best tomato salad Ive ever eaten and it makes sense as as Ive followed Chef Crenn for years now its no secret that she can make a tomato dance!  We also enjoyed the escargot, the mussels and though the brussel sprouts were slightly undercooked the seasoning was perfect. Then there is the trout-truly fabulous. Chef Crenn clearly trusts the trout and in doing so lets it be. Its cooked over a wood fire and it appears she simply adds lemon. I feared it would be too simple when it arrived at the table and it is what made me come back within two weeks of my first visit. I awoke the next morning thinking about the trout. \nAnd though I am not Gluten Free they are serving a GF free bread option that may be the best bread Ive ever eaten. Super!\nThe wines are worth a trip all on their own. We had a beautiful burgundy that was a delight. \nThe service is causual. The servers seem to take the approach that you will let them know what you need however it isnt as though we felt forgotten but rather not intruding upon. They seem to be clear that this is not a showplace for service but rather food and atmosphere. On both trips we met those sitting near by and enjoyed conversation.\nVery little pomp, great food and wine, an approachable very talented chef and a warm space to settle in and enjoy!\nBravo!!!", "author": "Kate S."}

It was one of the best meals I've had in years. If you like seafood and adventurous cuisine, I would highly recommend Petit Crenn. \n\nQuick rundown of my favorites. Four different types of incredibly fresh oysters. A fantastic assortment of mushrooms that I have never encountered, but were so flavorful. A delicious brussel sprouts dish served on the stalk. The mussels were delightful and were served with some exquisite bread. A five pound Octopus served whole--this was unlike anything I had ever seen! The portion sizes on the mussels and octopus were extremely generous. The wine pairings were also phenomenal! Be prepared to set aside 2 hours to feast. \n\nI'm already looking forward to my next visit.", "author": "Andrew T."}

I loved the aesthetics and hoped for a nice new addition to the neighborhood. Sadly... My friend and I waited two hours for food we ordered, completely ignored... Felt like we had to really go out of our way to get water and wine in our glasses. Almost like a hostage situation? ;b The server who sadly shares my name said she was sorry in a 'fake-friendly way' said she would take off a couple dishes for the fact that the order was misplaced by the kitchen... Working in service, I know it is in very bad taste to blame the kitchen. Finally had to ask for the bill after another 30 min of waiting, never got food boxed  and was over charged $100 on check. They claimed it was a printer issue they have been experiencing. But why would they not double check the receipts they were printing if that were an issue? We would have over paid if not for looking at check... I would have been happy if they seemed to care about our patronage, but rather the sever was very defensive and rude, when I told her she had over charged us and we had been waiting for over two hours. She then gave us a $5 off discount... Wow. My time and future patronage is only worth $5? Cool. I think this place needs more servers, or perhaps should let patrons tip vs. including tips in their check? More incentive for servers to at least seem happy to serve you? That would help the Yelp reviews that clearly are not the most amazing for an over priced, not so amazing eating experience. What a waste of time and terrible way to spend a Saturday evening.

So, my husband took me to Petit Crenn last night for our anniversary. I was beyond thrilled but was a little disappointed when we were escorted to seat in the corner of the bar area. My husband had made reservations and had said it was a very special occasion for us. The host was very nice but placed us to the side, and we were to wait for a Good Samaritan who would be willing to exchange his table for our two seats at the end of the bar. It was awkward for us but worth the wait. We had a cramped table close to the bathroom but we didn't care. We are in love and we were eating at Petit Crenn! The food was all I expected and more! For sure, our next anniversary will be at Atelier Crenn but we did joke about making reservations now. Maybe then, we won't have to beg for a nice table!

I write this because poor service kills a restaurant, and there is no other way to make that clear to management. We were greeted coldly, by both the waitress and another woman who seemed to be hostess/manager. Both were grim, unsmiling, and put out by serving us. I have no idea why, other than I expressed dismay at their no longer serving breakfast despite having it written on a huge chalk board. A simple smile and a \"sorry\" would have smoothed it all over. Sad, as the food was lovely and the man who brought our food over and must have prepared it was friendly and smiling. Maybe train your employees who seem to have PBF?", "author": "Mary M."}

We were running late for this hard-to-get reservation, and the hostess was as accommodating as she could possibly be.

Everything we ordered was fast, and perfectly satisfying (not too heavy). The chef('s) came over to personally check on us, and we were blown away by the obvious personal touch in food, and in service. We have eaten at a few of the \"big names\" in the Bay (Manresa, Plumed Horse, Chez Panisse, etc), but this is a new favorite hideaway, a delicious treat.

Brittany is one of our favorite places we have visited in France.\nWe came for lunch. Street parking was easy to find, even though the restaurant sits just beyond the busy section of Hayes at Octavia.\nOverall, the experience was very good. Service was pleasant and efficient. The portions were easy to share (and large enough to, as well). Here's what we had:\nGoug\u00e8res with gruyere cream and pickled shallot: The flavors were great. The shallot gel\u00e9e made a nice contrast to the richness of the cheese. If the choux pastry had been a little more crisp, it would have provided an even better contrast to the filling.\nSalad: I don't recognize the salad that we had from their online menu, but it was delicious with a citrus vinaigrette.\nParisienne Gnocchi: Ours came with hen of the woods mushrooms and baby kale. The sauce made from the mushrooms was great. I felt the gnocchi were a bit heavy (perhaps this was on purpose? I'm not familiar with Parisian gnocchi). Unfortunately, as the dish sat at the table, the sauce started to break; it remained tasty, though.\nPetit Crenn Omelette: This was also delicious. The eggs were cooked into a roll that reminded me of a cross between Jacques Pepin and tamago.\nI wouldn't have minded a few more choices of cider on the menu.\nI'm not sure how well the dishes connected to the Bretagne heritage, but the food was well done in a French manner, good flavors and reasonable portions. Prices were reasonable given that no tipping is necessary.", "author": "Bob G."}

There were four chairs open at the bar and a cleaned off (not set) four top by the window.  After five minutes, a woman (no idea if she was a server, host, owner, cook) says to us.  It will be a few minutes.  Absolutely nothing more.  TWENTY  minutes later, yes 20 minutes, a gentleman comes out and offers to seat us at the table that has been empty for 20 minutes.  After I sat, I called him over to very gently say that we want through an experience that could and would ruin an otherwise nice experience.  How can any service or business improve if they never receive feedback?  He seriously interrupted me a few times saying they planned to take care of us?  What does that mean? Honestly, NOTHING.

The place is TINY, with the kitchen open so you can watch the chefs prepping the food and muse about the different equipment and the next dish. However, the size of the place makes it so that it gets quite loud quite easily -- I was in a group of six people, and it was near impossible to hear the jazzy French music playing in the background, let alone the person at the other end of the table. Dinner conversation with the whole table was a no go.\n\nFood:\nAppetizers: I really enjoyed both of these -- absolutely delicious\nGougeres: tiny lil cream puffs, with a salty, savory filling\nFrench omelette: warm and filled with herbs and smooth and delicious! amazing amazing amazing\nSardines: surprisingly mild flavor, with a delicious spice topping\n\nCourses:\n1) Church Point oysters with a smoked tomato gelee -- 2 per person, the plating was beautiful and the tomato gelee complimented the brininess. A highlight of the night!\n2) Escargot and chanterelle mushroom in a broth -- individual bowls, the escargot had a similar texture to the mushroom, which was interesting to me. I would have preferred more variance in texture, but wasn't bad per say. \n3) Cauliflower gratin with smoked breadcrumbs -- came in a large bowl for the entire table. it tasted pretty standard; I wasn't particularly impressed. \n4) Grilled cabbage and crispy shallots in a charred leeks vinaigrette -- one plate for the entire table. the vinaigrette made this cabbage shine, but it was overly charred and difficult to eat\n5) Whole rainbow trout with a cider sabayon -- 1 per two people -- without a doubt, the star of the night! Cooked with lemon and herbs inside the trout, deboned by the sous chef, the perfect tenderness, especially the bits next to the lemon. The cider sabayon was AMAZING! \n6) Salade of little gems with an anchovy caper vinaigrette and heirloom tomato-fromage -- it came in a large bowl for the entire table. Overall quite delicious -- the dressing was surprisingly delicious and the textures from the tomatoes and savory (fishy) tuile were lovely! Also came with a wedge of cow's milk cheese, made by monks, who would wash the rind in an almond liquor. Pleasantly surprised by the mild, nutty flavor!\n7) Citrus mousse -- the mousse was served in the orange and was slightly salty, but was complimented nicely by the cap of the orange, which had bits of frozen orange left inside. I prefer my mousse to be lighter and creamier, so I was left feeling a bit unsatisfied\n8) Mignardaises: mmmm the butter cookie and the caramel were delicious, but the truffle was too dark and overpowering.\n\nService: Impeccable! The sommelier and servers were all lovely and attentive, filling up wine and water and checking to make sure everything was taken care of.\n\nOverall, I was only fully pleased with half the dishes I'd received, and given the price tag ($72/person), that's pretty disappointing. I've had better at lower costs.", "author": "Courtney N."}
