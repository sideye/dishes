This is a charming coffee shop on 9th Avenue, and the wooden furniture and soft lighting makes this a perfect place if you are looking for a workspace or just a cafe to meet up with a friend to chat for a while. \n\nI've tried several of their espresso-based drinks and have not been disappointed. Their Americanos are great, but if you have a sweet tooth, they have a few drinks that include condensed milk as one of the ingredients. I've tried their caf\u00e9 bomb\u00f3n, which takes a base of condensed milk and adds a double shot of espresso. The bitterness of the espresso balances the milk well, and it makes me nostalgic for those old days studying abroad in Spain (where I'd get a caf\u00e9 biberon at the local cafes). \n\nSeating is limited, but I've never had a problem finding a table for myself.

The quaint (and Instagrammable) storefront, dim lighting and abstract music, crafty but disproportionately pricey coffee drinks--the vibes are exactly the same, and perhaps a bit more gentrified. \n\nI was in the dilemma of wanting to be adventurous but not willing to splurge so much on coffee, so I went with the cafe bombon since it was the cheapest specialty drink. From the description it wasn't clear that it was an espresso shot, so as someone who prefers larger-than-tiny-shot-sized coffee drinks, I was a bit disappointed. I guess it's my fault for not clarifying my expectations, but it seemed like nothing special; just strong coffee made sweet and creamy with condensed milk.... and of course anything tastes good with condensed milk. \n\nThe baristas were friendly and without hipster attitude, and Snowbird is far less pretentious than some of the more extreme hip coffee watering holes of SF. I just didn't find anything special, especially since the ambiance and details felt so oddly identical to Hollow. The wifi and outlets are a plus, but I can't find myself being productive here since the lighting isn't great. \n\nSorry, Snowbird! I wanted to get excited about this cute little coffee shop, but at the end of the day I'd rather go to Martha's for its more extensive menu (at better places) and brighter atmosphere.\n\n(Side note: Apparently bombon can mean chocolate or scrumptious girl, and my visit to Snowbird featured neither chocolate nor scrumptiousness.)", "author": "Edna C."}

Door open = handicap accessibility (which is important!!!). But the name is apropos. Worth mentioning. \n\nI'm a fan of the aesthetic. There are little pinnies and banners around. The interior is tiny, with these little circular tables that jut out of the benches themselves. It forces you to either sit at it alone, with your notebook/laptop, or to only be able to share a table with a fellow coffee/tea drinker. \n\nThe coffee is pretty good. The matcha latte foam tasted too grainy for my liking. Though that may just be a preference factor. I'd recommend this location for anyone who is in the inner sunset, or even traveling there. It's located so close to the N line that you could easily swing by on the way to another engagement. Though that would deprive you of the quirky atmosphere.", "author": "Nicole C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-01", "description": "I love trying new coffee shops. Snowbird is kind of an old, new coffee shop for me. Located in the old Drip'd Coffee Lab space a couple of years ago, the front of the house received a new facelift, while they're still making soap in the back. The wooden counter gives it a very Californian feel, while the rest of the seating is reminiscent of some of the hipster cafes I've come across in Brooklyn. When I used to live in the Northeast, \"snowbirds,\" were people who flocked south, mainly to Florida, in seek of warmer weather when winter came. Having grown up in the Sunset, there are snowbirds year round in these parts in seek of warmer refuge. Enter this coffee shop.\n\nFor coffee aficionados, their specialty selection is the Cafe Bombon, a shot of espresso with condensed milk. It's a simple concoction, which I'm sure would taste more like a Vietnamese iced coffee if it were poured over some cubes. Their latte was standard if you like more milk in your drink. It's always a nice drink to warm you up on a cold San Francisco day. If you fancy cold brews, I highly recommend their bottled cold brew for $4.50. Chug, or enjoy slowly - there's absolutely no acidity. \n\nThe space is a little too small and dim for my liking, but I appreciate the atmosphere. The tables are personal-sized to fit a single laptop so sharing may be an issue. Prime location gives you a stone's throw to Arizmendi Bakery across the street for some fresh pastries or pizza.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Awhile ago, DRIP'D tried and I thought they were doing pretty well, so it was surprising for me to walk over one day and see that it had closed.\n\nNow comes Snowbird, accepting the passed torch with open palms and inheriting this highly coveted spot on 9th & Irving. I have to give them points for a better name and a better use of space. The awkwardness of sharing the area with another business that sells cleaning solutions has been remedied: there's actually plenty of seating and a nice open feeling when you first enter the storefront. The lighting is a little dim for my taste but the hipsters with their Macs and the store's vintage movie posters and succulent-lined shelves make Snowbird strangely appealing. Like, I feel a little cooler just for buying my coffee here.\n\nUnfortunately, the espresso was a letdown. I tried both the Americano and the Cafe Bom Bom (shot of espresso with condensed milk). Both were sour, but the sourness was especially pronounced in the Cafe Bom Bom. I'm sure the coffee beans here are excellent but the roasting method, to me, seems to yield espresso that isn't on par with the quality of the beans. Maybe it's a personal preference or because I'm really just a coffee dilettante who prefers bitter and burnt over under-roasted and sour (and yes, I admit it, I'm a regular Americano-drinker over at Starbucks and Martha's). \n\nI want to see Snowbird do well and am inclined to give their pour overs and cold brew a try.

The coffee itself is carefully brewed to order and strong--just how I like it. The pastries are fresh, but was rather limited when I went. \n\nThe space itself, while beautiful, is very small and the tables are even smaller. If you're expecting a cafe to do anything more than catch up with some friends (I.e. Get your Sunday work done), you might have to look elsewhere.

I've encountered quite a bit of that in the recent travels to Europe and the East Coast. Oakland is very in right now. I tried to impress the man with my recent trip to Omotesando Koffee, aka the coffee zen master in the trendiest part of Tokyo to counter him. But he was only slightly impressed because he's been to Tokyo recently also and had it, as it so happens. Then, just like that, I said, \"Have you been to Snowbird Coffee?\" \n\n\"Where is that? Idaho?\" He asked.\n\n\"No, Inner Sunset.\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, the burbs.\" He replied dismissively.\n\n\"Actually, it's not anymore. There are hipster joints too now too in that part of town.\" A man to the left of me said. \n\nI was finally saved by the bystander who was going to let me have this one.\n\nI will have you know it's in the December 2014 issue of Zagat, that Snowbird was named as one of the three must try new coffee / pastry shops in this city. And of course I must have the hand-shaken 1906 Shakerato Coffee, which reminds one of Italy, naturally. For my companion, I ordered a cappuccino. They made a heart on the foam, but what I heart the most of it was that they used full fat milk, which my lean, tall friend could use. He makes me look ridiculously fat when I stand next to him. I have considered fatten him up with dollops of butter in his cappuccino, but it would be too cruel of thing to ruin his otherwise perfect coffee. \n\nThe shop itself is very interesting. I would have missed it if it weren't for the fact that it felt like it's sunken in, like the shops you'd see in Germany and Czech Republic. In the back of the shop was a green cleaning product replenishing station. Bring your own bottle and pay only for the refills to save the environment. This type of cohabiting schema is actually quite popular in Portland, and seemingly haphazard. It's like two people who had casual sex, and the woman gets pregnant and decides to keep the miracle baby for she's in her late 30s, and the man decides to move in to co-parent, and a few years later, they have another child via in-vitro just so they could give the first born a sibling. On surface they exist in a functional, peaceful and even loving way, yet their coexistence lacks the apparent logic and substantialism. Which is to say, most of the coparenting couples in the city fit that M.O., or at least among the greater circle of friends of mine. Which is also to say, this shop fits the M.O. of the eclectic city it resides in, and I'd go even one step further to say that this lack of coherence is quite charming and unique, and who knows, it might even catch on by other entrepreneurial businesses. \n\nI downed my 1906 and walked with my companion across the park (GGP), but not before making a mental note to bring my empty bottles back for some refills while sipping Cafe Bombon the next time I'm in.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Also, they have some random thing in the back that either sells shampoo or lotion. I'm not quite sure. People would back over there and all seemed to know what they wanted. I was sitting right in front of said space and it didn't bother me at all. The tables towards the back are rather on the small side (but look cool), if you are only using your comp (as I was) it won't be a problem.\n\nA lot of the patrons seemed to know the staff ands questions like \"how was the wedding?\" or \" Hows so-and-so?\" which I thought was really cool as well.

He repeated that it was getting busy - clearly letting me know that I needed to spend more money or get out. \n\nI understand the need to do this when there are some customers that set up camp and sit all day at a table after ordering a small coffee.

I recently had a pourover and a pain au chocolat, and it came to $8.  I guess that's the going rate in SF these days, but it really just made wonder if I was getting an $8 experience.  The pourover was significantly smaller than those from Philz, and frankly it was rather bitter and watery.  The pain au chocolat lacked character and tasted like it was from an industrial bakery.  They were selling beans from Denver's Huckleberry Roasters for $24.40 a pound.  Seems steep.  I don't think there's anything better in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't say this is a destination coffee shop like Philz, Four Barrel, Blue Bottle, Ritual, or Sightglass.\n\nIt's also very annoying that the floor has a slight bump near the area with the lids, milk, and sugar.  If you're walking to the back of the shop with a full cup of coffee, it's easy to stumble and spill your drink.  It's not Snowbird's fault, so I'm not holding it against them, but it's still annoying.\n\n*** August 2016 update... I'm happy to report that the pastries have gotten much better.  They've partnered with Devil's Teeth Baking Company.  However, the pourovers remain a disappointment.  You're better off with an espresso drink.", "author": "Lucullus L."}

I quickly alerted the barrista to this, and instead of an apology, he looked a little irked, and told me that next time I need to ask for \"extra hot.\"  I did a mea culpa as he started a new one, and I asked him nicely to make it as hot as a regular coffee.  After all, he does have a milk steamer and can make it super-hot if he likes.\n\nSo ... after all this he did finish the 2 cocoas, and they were room temperature.

I found Snowbird's brand  a bit pretensious  I am a latte drinker but Snowbird only makes expresso drinks with full fat milk. What;s the big deal with offering your customers choice? $15.00 for a pound of Coffee? NO, $15.00 for 12oz of coffee! Back to the Beanery.", "author": "Alison B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "Loved the chill ambience of this place. A smaller cafe in contrast to the larger, industrial-styled coffee shops throughout San Francisco, and was a nice shift of style. Cozy, had a few but comfortable seating arrangements. Workers were really nice, coffee was relatively average, but there were only a few options when it came to drinks/food. Interesting refillable/recyclable station in the back for what I think was various lotions (random?). Overall, would probably come back here just for the environment and for those days I want to hide myself away from society or get some work done.", "author": "Michela Y."}

I appreciate that they say \"see you soon\" as you leave, really makes you feel welcome. The care they take in crafting the experience reminds me of some of the great coffee shops in Tokyo. Right now they have beans from Ruby Roasters in Wisconsin. I'm looking forward to the rotating selection; it's nice to mix things up from the standbys sometimes. Also a nice place to hang out, and they even have wifi.", "author": "David K."}

They absolutely love dogs, and they have a bench out front where you can hang out with your pooch if the weather's not too bad. The decor is also great - very urban chic. The only reason I don't give it the full five stars is just because the building is kind of long and thin, and doesn't get so much light towards the back. That said, if you like to squirrel yourself away with your laptop, and you don't care about being in sunlight, then this might even be a plus for you.", "author": "Laura P."}
