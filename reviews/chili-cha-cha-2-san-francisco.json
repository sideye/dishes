The food is inexpensive, portions are generous, and service is quick/attentive!\n\nMy personal favorite dish here is the Chili Cha Cha Spicy Pan Fried Noodles with Beef! If you love spicy food, then you have to order this dish because it's absolutely amazing and just has so much flavor. I recently had my boyfriend try these spicy pan fried noodles for the first time and he was completely mesmerized by how good it was and why he didn't try it sooner! The Tom Kha Noodle Soup with Rice Noodles is also another favorite and very satisfying on a chilly SF night. \n\nChili Cha Cha is conveniently located within walking distance of the 24th Street Bart Station. Sometimes I'll order food here to-go, if I'm feeling too lazy to cook (which is 99.9% of the time) and getthe Pan Fried Noodles to bring home.

Well my endless streak of exploring Taquerias for Veggie Burritos for weeks on end came to a pause recently as I decided to go for some Thai food in the Mission.\n\nI went w/ the $10.95 Lunch Combo Plate. I got the coconut milk soup for my first course, fresh tofu veggie spring rolls for my second course, & for my entree ordered the yellow curry w/ tofu & veggies having this w/ some brown rice for $1 more.\n\nThe coconut milk soup was sweet & arrived first. It was quite hot so decided to have it as my last course. Shortly thereafter my entree w/ the spring rolls arrived. The spring rolls were quite alright as had plenty of veggies as was liked a salad rolled together w/ a sparingly use of tofu w/ a savory peanut dipping sauce.\n\nFor my entree I enjoyed the yellow curry w/ brown rice. I requested it medium spicy & it had just the right amount of heat. I also requested some of the hot sauces on the side yet didn't use that much of it as they hit the mark w/ just the right amount of kick.\n\nService was attentive & felt the atmosphere was relaxed along w/ being fairly quiet. The total for the meal including tip was $15.50. You can easily order a spicy noodle veggie soup or pad thai that would make a meal here less costly yet feel the lunch combination is the way to go for a feeling & healthy meal in the Mission in a fairly relaxed & quiet atmosphere. Of course I will surely go for another veggie burrito at some point yet it is good to mix it up.\n\nOf special note for vegans or vegetarians dining here know that it is quite veg-friendly here as the menu states that vegetarian items & versions are available upon request as they can make anything on the menu vegan. Substitution w/ tofu & veggies is the same price as regular menu item yet  w/ vegetarian meat it is an additional $3. \n\nI made special inquiry into what the vegetarian meat was & it is indeed vegan yet is made w/ soy & is a veggie \"chicken\". If it is indeed gluten-free I didn't inquiry yet will be sure to ask next time I come here as much as I love my beans & rice one can only eat so many veggie burritos before having to switch it up changing paradigms like a chameleon like the late greats Prince & David Bowie.", "author": "Shane S."}

I can't go everywhere my customers tell me, but a few of my favorite Thai places in the city have been letting me down of late so thought I'd take a chance on this ... and it was wonderful.  Some of the best Thai food I've ever had in the city.  Chicken Satay, Tom Kha Khai, Pad Thai, curries, all excellent. Chicken Satay is worth another mention as it is the best presentation of it I've ever had.  Instead of separate bowls, they put the chicken skewers (cooked perfectly) directly into the peanut sauce, which has been poured on to a rectangular plate, and at one end is the traditional cucumber & red onion salad in sweet sauce -- all those flavors together are amazing!  Serving staff is the nicest and the interior, although nothing fancy, somehow has a calming effect.  I love coming here, I love eating here.  True comfort Thai restaurant.\n\nUPDATE 8/18:  since the original review I have been back here several more times and there have been more items to love, although a few not as much.\n\nThe Sweet Pumpkin Soup is ... amazing!! ...  but ask them to use steamed tofu, not fried. And Cashew Nut Chicken is very good.\n\nDishes that surprisingly didn't do as much for me: Peanut Noodles (def skip), Pot Stickers ('ok'), Pineapple Fried Rice (good, but not of caliber of other dishes, had better), and Panang Curry.  I'm surprised about the Panang because their other curries are amazing, but it has a different flavor than I'm used to, don't love it -- like it better at one or two other places.\n\nAlso, the Tornado Beef, the only dish that uses flank steak cut into chunks (other dishes use a different cut of beef, which is sliced), and which is a gorgeously presented dish and has a nice flavor, I found the beef to be a little tough.  I had expected it to be like stew beef where the chunks come apart at the touch of your fork and is so tender -- but, alas, no.  (Ironically,a similarly named Thai restaurant called Cha-Am, on Folsom @ 3rd, does an amazing Panang with stewed beef, although that's the only thing good they do -- Chili Cha Cha is much better in all other respects).\n\nAlso, as I said earlier, Pad Thai is very good, although I should add here that they use the Thai noodles for this that are more like vermicelli, very thin, and so it tends to clump.  Some other restaurants use a noodle that more resembles linguine, which I feel is a better choice, doesn't clump as much and has a chewier texture that I like.  But it just depends upon chef's preference (or your preference) on that one -- it's still tasty here -- although, like the pumpkin soup, I'd ask for the tofu steamed, not fried.\n\nBut this restaurant is SO good on its other dishes, there is no need to take any stars away -- and some folks may like what I don't (Panang seems to be very popular here, despite how I feel about it).\n\nI am still coming back again and again when I need my Thai food fix!\n\nUPDATE 8/28/18:  Tonight when I got up to leave the restaurant I noticed two young women sitting in the one booth table Chili Cha Cha 2 has (the nicest place to sit in the restaurant), and not only did they have their shoes off, including no socks, but they had their legs curled up on the seat, with feet touching the seats.  Now COME ON, people!  That kind of behavior is just way beyond appropriate, complete lack of respect for the employees and the other customers, and just plain rude.  This is a restaurant, not your damn living room.  Of course, the wonderful ladies who work there were being their usual polite selves and said nothing.  I was so close to doing it for them, but bit my lip so as not to make a scene as the place was packed.  But SO close...", "author": "Merrick W."}

I drank so much water, tea, and ate a lot of rice. It feels very much Americanized.

But last night's delivery cannot go un-commented upon.\nIt's bad enough that they use frozen vegetables from a bag (which are easy to identify by the zig-zag cut, see for yourself), but they are simply not even bothering to cook the curry anymore: Diluted yellow curry sauce (also from a bag?) add frozen veg, throw in some of those pre-made fried tofu cubes, barely heat it up, send it out the door.  I understand that restaurants are difficult, but you just have to cook it.  No way around that one.\nThe carrots and potato chunks were cold and tough. The cabbage was plentiful, and almost crisp.  Tofu cubes: cold and mealy.  It was about 50% potatoes, some carrots, cabbage and tofu cubes.  I didn't find any other vegetables in this veggie yellow curry.  The sauce was lukewarm and bland.  (I make my own Thai yellow curry from various curry pastes available in stores, and all of them have more flavor than this.)\nThe pad thai, I suspect, is probably also pre-made: sauce from a jar, perhaps?  Boil the rice noodles, stir in the sauce, five pieces of frozen broccoli, five pieces of pre-made fried tofu cubes - don't bother to cook the veg and tofu, they'll get warm in the box on the way.  \nFinally, make the pad thai right away then wait 30 minutes before warming up the curry so it is good and dead by the time it arrives.\nThis place started out halfway decent but has steadily become terrible.  Can't ever order from here again.  Given that I have ordered from here about fifty times in the past five years, I am very suspicious about the positive reviews of this place.

While not the best Thai food I've had in SF, it is certainly the best value. \n\nFOOD: \n- Pad kee mao (drunken noodle) with chicken was flavorful with a higher than average vegetable to noodle ratio (much appreciated!). Expectedly greasy but not too overwhelming. I ordered medium spice, which was truly medium (perfect amount of kick for me To calibrate, I enjoy the jalapenos on her banh mi but not the burning sensation that follows). My one critique with this dish was the bark-like pepper flakes I was unable to chew. I am guessing they were fried to maximize flavor, and perhaps this issue would not arise with the \"mild\" version.\n- Honey duck was the darling of the table. The duck had notes of tamarind too and was sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Duck itself is greasy fowl, but this dish was no greasier than my noodles, and the bed of steamed bok choy it was served atop balanced out the fat nicely. \n- Spring rolls were refreshing and light--I appreciated that these were wrapped Vietnamese style (thin rice wraps) rather than the thicker rice wraps I often see at other Thai restaurants. \n- Tom kha (spicy coconut soup) was heavy on the coconut, which makes the soup mild enough for those who don't like spice. Flavor was nice, but a little sweeter than I like it given all the coconut.\n\nSERVICE:\n- Servers were incredibly attentive. I never felt rushed or abandoned. Water refills were plentiful, and I felt at ease as I was asked frequently how my food was :). The food came LIGHTNING FAST. In-N-Out takes longer to dish out my food with much less fanfare/plating than Chili Cha Cha 2 did :). \n\nAMBIANCE:\n- Cozy, laid back ambiance with warm lighting and cushion-lined walls, but surprisingly roomy within. There were ~15 tables inside that can be shifted to accommodate anything from a solo diner to a large group. Given the very short wait time (no reservation, no problem!), this is a solid place in the neighborhood great for a quick bite or impromptu group meal.", "author": "Helen W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-11", "description": "I went here with my partner as we found ourselves hungry in the Mission District.  She was there for lunch a couple of weeks earlier and she ordered pot stickers with her special and instead received an egg roll.  After bringing it to the servers attention the server proceeded to tell her that she indeed had ordered the egg roll.  The pot sticker never came. \n\nOn our visit we ordered the Green Curry with chicken and the Cashew Nut Chicken.  The curry was unremarkable and the Medium spice that I ordered didn't have a tint of heat. The Cashew Nut Chicken on the other band was very good, as the cashews contained a smoky grilled taste that really enhanced the dish.  We also ordered the Fresh Spring Roll.  These rolls came to the table first and were presented very nicely with a traditional peanut sauce.  The sauce was nothing to write home about but after we each took a small piece of the roll, I didn't see a shrimp in mine.  My partner didn't either. There was tofu in the roll as was advertised on the menu but no shrimp that we could see or taste. After calling the waitperson to our table she told us that there was indeed shrimp in the roll and pointed to the reddish color on the side of several of the rolls. The lighting in the place was dim and she walked away.  I opened two of the rolls and that reddish substance was carrot not shrimp.  We left the uneaten dish on our table through the completion of the meal.  \n\nAfter we had completed our dishes the server came by and asked us how our meal was.  I pointed over to the plate with a couple of the rolls opened and unrolled and again proceeded to tell her that there were no shrimp only tofu.  She looked and smiled as she took the dish away from our table. At this point I fully expected to have this item taken from our bill.  But guess what?  They charged me.  \n\nMy partner then relayed to me her past experience when the server ( a different lady) told her that she ordered an egg roll instead of a pot sticker. She thought that it could be a language problem. I did not agree as our server repeated our order to us after we gave it to her.\n\nChili Cha Cha 2 offers up unremarkable Thai food.  From our table we could see that they do a phenomenal take out business. But for the life of me, I don't understand why as San Francisco has so many great Thai Restuarants..\n\nUnfortunatley, Chili Cha Cha 2 is not one of them.", "author": "Nick C."}

It seems their kitchen is kept busy with a high volume of pickup and delivery orders, but simple dishes for in-house dining still arrive pretty quickly.\n\nAs someone with shellfish and nut allergies, Thai food can be a terrifying prospect. This place feels safe in that they don't sprinkle gratuitous peanuts over every dish (though I do still ask for none every time, just in case), and they are very accommodating to alter your order in other ways.\n\nI order basically the same thing every time: yellow curry with chicken. I also add extra vegetables, so that you're not just eating potatoes. This gets you more cabbage, carrot, and broccoli, yay colors. Not sure if they tack on extra $ for that.\n\nCrispy vegetarian rolls are perfect to split with 2-3 people (you get 6 cross-cut halves).\n\nThai and lychee iced teas are nice and sweet and peppy (lychee tea has a whole fruit at bottom), but nothing special here.\n\nSweet pumpkin soup is really quite sweet. It is too sweet for me for a main course, and I like sweet. Maybe save it for a nuggety dessert, instead.\n\nFriends have been happy with the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, and fried rice was another simple tasty meal that provided me a little breakfast the day after :)\n\nSingle bathroom is always clean, but a little uncomfortable to wait in line for, since it's right next to the kitchen.\n\nOh, and one of these days I will ask why Chili Cha Cha /2/.

First off, this place is divy little thai restaurant in the, wait for it....the Mission, surprised? Lol. If you are a SF local you know what I mean;) \n\nAnywho, off to the real deal here, the food and service. \n\nThough we were greeted pretty quickly, we had to wait a bit before we were waited on, annoying when it wasn't busy, and it was a week night. The menu is your typical thai stuff. My friend got the yellow curry with pumpkin and chicken, I got the tom yum soup, vegetarian style (fyi-which includes braised tofu, which I would have known, I would have asked for regular tofu), and the papaya salad since my friend raved about it from eating before. The papaya salad was good, but I have had better. It was bit too marinated in the sauce and not the right flavor, something was missing. My friend liked his dish, it looked good. As for my soup, it was okay, good for a cool night in SF, but uneventful overall.  \n\nThe waitress never came back to wait on us, though the place was not busy, and it was a week night nonetheless as I mentioned before. We even had to find the waitress all the way in the back of the place to to get the bill to pay. \n\nAll in all, it was okay thai place if you are in the area and need a quick thai fix. Being a foodie, I am not sure if I would make effort to come back, since there alot of great thai places in SF to try. But I wouldn't mind if coming back, if my friend wanted to, and maybe trying the vegetarian salad. It did sound good.", "author": "Sonia A."}

The kind where it hurts so bad to swallow that you cry a bit each time. Someone on the internet said that Tom Kha soup helps. I had theirs. Tom Kha soup is a plain delicious soup with some interesting vegetables - some a bit tricky to chew - all of which combine to be healthy and nourishing. It's very, very delicious.  I went here every other day for 8 days, and ordered the vegetarian Tom Kha soup (large size) and it was the sweetest relief. Some other reviewer said the Tom Kha is too sweet - I hate sweet food, it doesn't taste sweet to me. Sometimes I would have a bit of white rice with it.\n\nThey also have nice fresh meal choices, aside from the soup. I love their vegetarian spring rolls - they are very refreshing and subtly flavored. The lunch specials are very cheap. But at the end of the day, I will always order Tom Kha soup when I come here.\n\nThe staff are friendly and sweet - I think this restaurant deserves a lot more attention than it gets.\n\nEdit: the Tom Kha soup no longer comes with spices automatically added. For the medicinal properties discussed above, please request spicy Tom Kha soup. \n\nAlso, I have since tried other dishes and I don't order this every time now. Their Pad See Ew is also very good.", "author": "A T."}

I was excited to finally order from one of my neighborhood spots, especially after reading the good reviews.  After ordering, they were swift and friendly in their delivery.  Unfortunately, the meal itself wasn't great.  The samosas, made with puff pastry, were mushy and falling apart.  The papaya salad was pretty good, but 2/3 of the dish was lettuce leaving only enough for a side for 1 person.  The Tom Kha was far from authentic, but popular amongst the other reviewers - so I reduce it to a matter of taste on that one.  I won't be ordering from here again, but I'm sure they have some good stuff.", "author": "Jenn T."}

Place was fairly empty, with only 2-3 tables occupied, so got a seat quickly and great service throughout. They filled my water every time the glass was half empty. Cozy little place, and a nice casual feel. \n\nMost of the usual Thai staples on the menu, and some tasty-sounding specialties as well. Was only 2 of us and we weren't that hungry though, so went minimal in our ordering. Prices were pretty good: ~$25 total for 2 of us, though we did eat light. We got:\n- a bowl of Tom Yum, with prawns: lots of mushrooms, good bit of shrimp too, and great flavor. HUGE bowl, could easily be one person's meal, or shared between 2-4. Spicier than I expected too, as we ordered medium, but not a problem for me.\n- papaya salad: tasty, and nice lightly spicy sauce, which is sometimes drenched on and sometimes sadly absent, so done fairly well here. Presented beautifully too. \n- side of jasmine rice\n\nOverall, pretty happy with what we got, and our experience. Nothing blew me away, but seems like a great local/neighborhood Thai joint, that wasn't crowded pleasantly.", "author": "Kris K."}

Anyways, I ordered the Tom Kha soup and there was no lemongrass in it and the flavor was pretty absent unfortunately.  I asked them to add lemongrass and sent it back to the chef.  They put some sliced up curls of some type of root vegetable in there, and it tasted slightly like lemongrass but was a little different.  Some of the chunks were really hard, too, and I accidentally bit into it and hurt my tooth.  There were a few other chunks of things in there that tasted like raw turnips or something and definitely uncooked.  I really wanted to have a nice experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-27", "description": "This is a perfect place to stop in for an excellent Thai lunch. They never disappoint!\n\nFor the lunch menu, you have a choice between soup or salad to start. I always get the soup, which is a variety of vegetables (carrot, baby corn, mushroom, cabbage) in a delicious coconut lemongrass broth.\n\nNext is a choice of appetizers, that come with your entree: potstickers, spring rolls, chicken satay, etc. The fried tofu was the only one I found a little boring (imagine fried tofu, it can be boring). The spring roll is basically a salad, so usually I get that to compliment the soup.\n\nFor entrees, there are a dozen or so. Typically, I'd get the spicy eggplant or one of the curries. Order \"Thai spicy\" if you want it properly hot. It comes with rice, which you can upgrade to brown or sticky rice if you like.\n\nLately, I've been working my way down the menu to try everything, and so far it is all good. You can order each item with either chicken, pork, tofu, or beef. Or for extra make it shrimp, seafood combo, duck, or seitan. Each dish seems to call for a different meat, but chicken will fit the bill for any of them.\n\nThe portions are perfect for lunch, not too much to make you overfull and tired, but not too little to leave you wanting.\n\nIf you are looking for a Thai lunch in the Mission, this is the place to be.", "author": "Andy B."}

As far as Thai food goes, I think it's pretty hard for it to be below a 4 and equally hard for it to be over a 7.  Chili Cha Cha 2 perfectly proved my theory and earned a solid 6.  \n\nOverall, the food was slightly above average for Thai.  I was with a friend and we ordered my 2 favorite Thai dishes: Pad See Ew with beef and Panang Curry with chicken.  They were both good and decent sized portions.  The Pad See Ew was a little greasier than usual while the Panang Curry could use some work on the vegetable to chicken ratio (too many vegetables, not enough chicken).  The servers were nice and attentive but the restaurant was also empty.  \n\nI should also note that they're coconut juice was delicious and had plenty of fresh coconut pieces to make this coconut lover extremely happy.\n\nI'll probably end up going back to Chili Cha Cha at some point when I'm desperate for a quick Thai meal in the Mission but it's nothing out of the ordinary.", "author": "Sarah H."}

It's always a good sign when you hear the staff and cook speaking the language of the cuisine they're cooking. I tried their specialty of Yellow Curry with Pumpkin which was a delicious twist on your standard Thai Yellow Curry...essentially swapping out potatoes with pumpkins. Spicy n' creamy!\n\nI also had the peanut chicken fried rice after work one night...wasn't too bad...probably would've been better if it was eaten with another dish. \n\nThe food was pretty good but the desserts were divine! The fried banana with ice cream especially made me loopy. I could eat that all day and all night (and die of a coronary...but with a smile on my face).\nKhop Khun Khrap/Khaa (do NOT make that into an Acronym)\n\nThey do not serve alcohol at the moment but have applied for a licence to serve it...so it will soon. Spicy Thai food and lager! (Singha) Unbeatable combo!\n\nThe decor is decent and Thai themed. (10x better than the previous establishment which looked like a lavatory...to say nothing of the Panda Express quality pre-cooked food).\n\nAn interesting touch is having a widescreen HDTV...so it was possible for me to watch the SF Giants win against the Phillies (thus going to the \"World\" series). Come to think of it...I probably should have been paying more attention to my date than the telly...oops. Maybe they should show Thai programming instead (especially Muay Thai matches!!). That should provide a more appropriate atmosphere.\n\nGood eats...affordable pricing...super convenient location (you can eat...then skip over to one of several nearby bars for drinks after). \nStreet parking naturally on 24th Street. So if you're having lunch on Monday through to Saturday...bring quarters (or try to score a residential spot which should be good for 2 hours before you get a ticket).\n\nIf ya fancy some curry and lager (not yet but soon)...give this place a go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-17", "description": "The only Thai restaurant within a large area of the Mission (I miss you Suriyama). If you need Thai, you can go here or Pad Thai, which isn't significantly better or cheaper. So there's that to consider. \n\nI think a lot of people go out to eat and expect to have their minds blown, especially  Valencia Street diners. This is not that place. It's also not as expensive or trendy as those places, and for the money I think it's perfectly acceptable, perfectly agreeable Thai food. In other words, don't take your date here before you've had sex. Go to the place with the asses on the backs of their seats instead. That'll impress her.\n\nI've eaten here 15+ times, both at the tables and to go, and it's not always consistent. Sometimes the chicken is tough, but it's always edible and never too greasy or nasty. Sometimes I ask for Thai Spicy and I get White Spicy. Sometimes (like last night), the spice level is hallucinogenic. Touche' Chili Cha Cha... \n\nThe Tom Kha soup with noodles has yet to let me down, although sometimes it's better than others. I ordered the \"Seafood Madness\" one time and it was amazing - 5 different types of seafood, and none of them made me sick.\n\nAlso, you can't judge (or call yourself a fan of) Thai food if all you ever do is order Pad Thai. Even more points are lost if you bitch about the food being bland, but purposely order everything mild. The food here doesn't rely on grease, so you need the spice to get the flavor. Otherwise, you might as well go to Cheesecake Factory. I hear they've Thai for you there that is TO DIE FOR. \n\nThis is a legitimate neighborhood spot. It's better than the Lemon Chili Lime place that used to be there, and it's saved my ass on many occasions from having to eat another burrito. It's not trying to impress you. It's not a destination for foodies. It's a utilitarian place for people who just want to get a good meal. By the way, the service is unpretentious and excellent, people are friendly, and there is no wait. Take that, Valencia Street!", "author": "Chris j."}

I understand they have new owners. One by one, here's what went wrong -\n\n1. It took 45 minutes to get our meal, when there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. I did take notice, however, that they were churning out volumes of food for delivery. Seems like they should give some priority to the people who are sitting right in front of them, right???\n\n2. Service was incredibly awkward. Our server refused to set any plates down on the table herself. Instead, she kept sticking them in front of me, until I'd finally grab it and do something with it.\n\n3. Crab rangoons were major disappointment. They were basically soupy, overheated cream cheese with very little crabmeat. In fact, there was very little cream cheese too.\n\n4. My wife's fried rice, which was supposed to come off the line spicy, and my wife asked for them to make it extra spicy, wasn't spicy at all. Not that they didn't pay attention to the special order (which they didn't), but they didn't make it the way it's supposed to come off the line.\n\n5. Firecracker balls were tiny, slightly over-fried, had very little filling (not even sure what was in it this time), and not spicy.

This location is a definite step up from the one in the Lower Haight, which is pretty good in it's own way.\n\nThe interior is rather chic.  I love the bamboo on the wall.  They avoided  the gilded decor seen in a lot of Thai restaurants and kept things simple and elegant.  Thumbs up for the murals.\n\nService was good.  We ran out of water a few times but otherwise, I have no complaints.  The staff was attentive and very welcoming.\n\nThe best part, however was the food.  That's where Chilli Cha Cha knocked it out of the park.  Everything was so fresh and perfectly cooked.  The larb came on a beautiful bed of assorted baby greens.  We shared the Tom Ka which was just lovely.  The spring rolls were crunchy and almost like little rolled up salads.  The best thing was the pumpkin curry with lamb.  I didn't think lamb got that tender.  It melted in my mouth.  You could cut it with the edge of your fork.  BLISS!\n\nI am so happy that they have opened on 24th Street.  I was also relieved to see the place fill up while we were eating. I was concerned about it being slow on a Friday.\n\nAs of this post, they do not yet have their liquor license.  The application was posted on the door.  They didn't mind us bringing our own bottle of wine, though.\n\nAppetizer, soup, salad, entree and rice was enough for two, with leftovers.

It's super close to my house, and it would be awesome to have some cheap dinner options close-by that aren't burritos. \n\nThe problem is not the service.  It's not the price point.  It's the food.  We had spring rolls, which tasted only of deep fryer and the dipping sauce was a spicy sweet chili sauce which also came with everything else we ordered.  We used it liberally on every dish to try to inject some much-needed flavor, but unfortunately 3 courses of sweet chili sauce gets a bit wearing on the old tastebuds.  I associate thai with really flavorful, savory dishes.  This place has a bit of tweaking to do before it gets there.\n\nThe menu is epically large.

And, the restaurant called to double check the accuracy of part of the order we had placed on line.\n\nTom Kha Gai with noodles was fantastic. Flavorful, with lots of fresh chicken breast and big chunks of mushroom. The noodles came on the side, so that they stayed un-soggy, and were accompanied by a generous dollop of caramelized onions & garlic atop perfectly steamed Chinese broccoli.\n\nFresh spring rolls with tofu and shrimp were tasty, with fresh mint leaves and a not-too-sweet peanut dipping sauce. They had shredded lettuce inside rather than the rice vermicelli noodles that I'm accustomed to, but that didn't alter the flavor much. My only complaint was that they sliced the rolls into many pieces. While this made sharing very convenient, it also caused the rolls to fall apart; perhaps rice noodles inside would be more starchy and cohesive. We ended up eating the spring rolls with a fork, like a salad. But if that's our biggest problem in life, well... you know.\n\nPanang curry w veggies & tofu was deliciously spicy and had a unique blend of vegetables; a little thinner sauce than would be my preference, but full of flavor nonetheless. We had it with brown rice, which was a tiny bit mushy. To be fair, that may have occurred in transit from the restaurant. The Pad See Ew with tofu was some of the best I've ever had. The tofu was lightly fried yet still soft on the inside - not rubbery. Lots of egg and Chinese broccoli in it, too. \n\nWill definitely order from CCC2 again!

The guys had noodle with peanut sauce and they loved it so much that they ordered another helping.\n\nPumpkin curry was as good as the one from OSHA (maybe better)\n\nGreat jasmine rice\n\nMango sticky rice good, but not the best I've ever had.\n\nWe got there early so we sat in the cozy booth.  Service excellent.\n\nWe'll be back", "author": "Brenda B."}

Not bad, just not special. I'll keep going back for convenience sake, but it's not a destination for me.", "author": "Joshua S."}

I mean, the pad thai is OK, but they only give you sporks to eat with (to-go).  The spring rolls were hands down the worst I've ever had.  I think they're just not their specialty.  They just taste like lettuce.  I mean... I see something else in there, but I can't taste it.", "author": "Cameron J."}

I think this will fit the bill when we're too lazy to walk all the way to Manivahn.  But, I must say that unfortunately the curries ands soups are a little sweet, and the calamari salad is just ok.  The ginger fantasy chicken is amazing, we'll get that every time.  Keep it up, CCC2 - a few little tweaks and this may just work out.", "author": "Julie L."}

No dice. \n\nEverything else I've tried here is top notch, and definitely love its fried calamari and Pad Thai. That said, I keep going back to the Tom Kha with combination seafood and steamed rice noodles. \n\nI mostly get delivery but every time I've dined in, it's been a great experience.", "author": "blake s."}

I really wanted to like Chilli Cha Cha.. but really, the food is pretty mediocre.\n\nThe first time I got chicken and noodels in peanut sauce. The sauce was way too thick. \n\nThe second time I got som tam salad and crispy tofu. The tofu was soggy and the salad had way too much fish sauce. \n\nSo.. eeeh. It's edible and they deliver pretty fast... but eeeeh.", "author": "A K."}

So I was thrilled to see that they were opening up a location in the Mission 2 blocks from my house. Sadly, the food is just not the same quality. I think they might have also increased the prices a bit. Its still decently priced but the other Chili Cha Cha was an absurdly good deal and the food was much better. This is just so-so Thai food in a city with many excellent Thai restaurants.\n\nSince they have not competition in the immediate area, I'm hoping they'll stick around. But if you want good Thai, make the journey to the inner Mission or Noe Valley or somewhere else. Chili Cha Cha is a convenient after-work dinner pickup but the food is nothing to write home about.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Despite the restaurant size, the menu is huge and I had to let my gf order long before I could decide what to take, but I'm also a special case :-)   After an almost endless deliberation, I opted for a clay pot with seafood (only shrimps and calamari rings), cabbage and soya noodles which was tasty, a little spicy and with a strong garlic flavour.  I honestly found a bit disappointing the calamari rings that you could have hardly distinguish from ... plastic. The dessert, sticky rice with vanilla ice cream was decent but nothing memorable. The service was good.  Not striking enough to make me a fan...", "author": "Andrea L."}

Hadn't heard of this place before but like to support neighborhood businesses. Unfortunately, it was so bad. The tom kha soup was cloying sweet and had cabbage and baby corn in it. Definitely not the authentic tom kha I was looking forward to. The second dish was missing a main ingredient and covered in a super sugary sauce. Wish I wouldn't have tipped 25% without knowing. Perhaps they felt that they no longer had to care. Oh well, now I know. Definitely won't order from here again.", "author": "Katie M."}

Being that I am broke I was indeed trying to get something affordable on the menu. The serving size was literally laughable. It was double wrapped in plastic bags (my girlfriend also asked for no bag) to hide how sincerely pathetic the amount of food was. It tasted great, but I was so upset that that much money couldn't even afford it to be over rice or with tofu. Never again. I liked he waitresses there too. Too bad.", "author": "D. Alexander H."}

The food is good, the decor is nice, the waiter was sweet, answered our questions and kept our water glasses full. They say they can make most of their dishes vegetarian - I haven't tested this too hard, but I really appreciate that they make it clear. Most importantly, the avocado curry was delicious.", "author": "Lana O."}

Actually, I wanted to try their special lunch combo which my friend is so in love with. Unfortunately, I got back in town late. Anyway, I'm glad that I did go to have dinner there.Well,We started with chicken pot stickers and fire cracker balls OMG those was YUMMY!! I ordered grilled salmon because I wanted to have something light.Grilled salmon served with veggies.It was so delicious and I feel healthy. My friend had their steak come with thai-style dipping sauce. Looked so great but I didn't try tho.My friend said that was tender and juicy. Our dessert was Fried banana and coconut ice cream which was so good. \n\n\n\nNice place.Great taste \n\nThe service is always extremely warm and friendly.\nPortion is feeling.\nI love their food presentation.those are outstanding\n\ndefinitely this is my thai place .", "author": "Kimberly J."}

This is the third chance I gave them to get it right, and it was worse than ever.  Way overcooked rice noodles, and tasteless.  Basically I got a bland soggy mess with scant Chinese broccoli.
