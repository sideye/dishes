This is basically a wannabe Vietnamese joint run by Chinese people.\n\nAt lunchtime hours (from 1-2PM), there were more employees than there were customers, since more people ordered take-out than dining in. Those customers are smart to do that because it was not a place to have a conversation while hearing all the yelling back and forth in Cantonese in the kitchen. \n\nWe ordered a Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef vermicelli) and a Bun Rieu (crab paste and tomato vermicelli). It is a CONVENTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE that every bowl of VIETNAMESE vermicelli comes with a COMPLIMENTARY side of basil and mint leaves and beansprouts, but apparently we had to pay an extra $1.50 for CHOPPED CABBAGE. Yes, that's right. CHOPPED CABBAGE. Very typical of a Chinese business to charge you just to breathe air in their facility. Screw cultural norms, right? If you're serving Vietnamese food, do it right! Anyways, the Bun Bo Hue was flavorless and needed an extra five helpings of salt to make it actually taste like food, the noodles were hard, rubbery, and undercooked as if they just threw it into the soup and served it without a second thought, and the Bun Rieu tasted as salty as ocean water itself. The tomatoes helped a lot. \n\nWhat a disgrace. Don't even get me started on the service...but since I'm at it, why not? Can they at least wash their hands after they pick their nose in front of their customers AND before they serve us food? That man deliberately dug his thumb with a lingering BOOGER ON IT into the lettuce! DISGUSTING! Anyways, at least we had iced water for each of us. The next table over had one cup of iced water for a family of four to share. LOL What a joke! \n\nIf it weren't for the ten-grain gelatinous dumplings (the only thing on the menu that's actually edible and guess what, is actually Chinese food!), I wouldn't come here again. One disappointment after another. They're not gonna last long.", "author": "Elaine L."}

My own fault bc I clearly didn't remember they're closed on Thursday's, and stopped by on Thursday's the two times before. Welp, third times the charm! \n\nHave y'all heard of Hing Lung? The infamous jook/porridge spot, once residing in Chinatown? They've been closed for a handful of years now, and I'd been MAJORLY missing that jook and Chinese donut in my life. BUT, a few months back I'd passed by Green Bamboo and read a sign that Hing Lung is back, baby! And once again making their jook and Chinese donuts, now at Green Bamboo! \n\nWell when I finally came by this third time, it turns out Hing Lung has reopened their own spot in San Bruno, but an insider told me that one of their jook chefs stayed around :) \n\nLonggg story short, got myself the fish porridge and 'cow tongue' donut. THE BEST. Finally got that thick porridge with the savory sweet donut I'd been missing all these years again! \n\nThe waitress was nice enough, and explained everything on the menu was available at 10am (not always the case at most places). Mama didn't want the jook so much so she opted for the spicy crab noodle stir fry, which honestly wasn't the best. The noodles in the picture looked a bit thicker than the vermicelli version that came out. And the crab wasn't really as tasty as it could've been either. \n\nWell, I personally came for the jook and I got the jook. So the 4 stars go to the jook!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

We ordered a bowl of beef congee with some non-negotiable fried donut (youtiao) and a fried tofu bahn mi to split.\n\nThe donut was brought out first. It was made very nicely - fried evenly and not too oily. The donut itself was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The \"seam\" was also still integral. Almost immediately after came the congee which is a huge bowl! Definitely meant to split between at least 2. The congee is also the thick and creamy version - yum! I love this version cause it shows just how long it's been simmering for. The beef was tender and for a person who is not a huge fan of ginger, the slivers actually provided a nice elevated flavor and wasn't too overpowering.\n\nOf course I ate it with endless pieces of youtiao coated in its creamy goodness! Overall, a very hearty meal and perfect for the chilly San Francisco day. Warms your whole body right up.\n\nAs for the bahn mi, their baguette is excellent! It crackles like a symphony when squeezed, but still provides a soft, heavenly interior that not only soaks in that vietnamese mayonaise, but also contains your choice of protein with pickled carrots and radish, jalepenos, and cilantro. We ordered the tofu with pate (#5) but it accidentally came without pate (because a second menu showed #5 as tofu OR pate - oops).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-24", "description": "When the wife had a strange hankering for \"cow tongue\" pastry last week, a quick Yelp check brought us to this unassuming, no frills hole-in-the-wall. Nope, bizarre food had not gone into her head!  Plain and simple, it is only a nickname for a Chinese donut ($2 each), elliptical in shape and looked like a cow's tongue. It had no association to a real life cow's tongue! Not too many places carry them, which are well loved by those in the know. Most Chinese love them eaten on their own or as an accompaniment with congee or jook. The donut in Bamboo was perfectly fried to a golden brown with minimal grease and slightly sweetened. The crust was crispy with the inside soft and fluffy. (4/5)\n\nBamboo features an extensive jook menu ranging from the familiar chicken or beef to the more intimidating pork blood and pork offals. Jook is their forte and we opted for the Sliced Fish Jook ($7.95) where the fish was a flounder, a mild flavored, lean white fish. The jook had a thick creamy consistency that went well with the donut. By force of habit, I added a few drops of soy (it actually didn't need it!) and a light sprinkling of white pepper to enhance its savoriness. (4/5)\n\nBamboo is both a Chinese and Vietnamese caf\u00e9. A bowl of hot and comforting Wonton Noodle Soup ($7.95) was hard to beat on any blustery day. A huge bowl was dropped off with 6 plump wontons, each almost the size of a golf ball. The broth though should have been hotter. I personally would prefer slippery bite-sized pieces of wonton that can slide down the hatch with less chewing!  That's just me! The wontons were stuffed with shrimps and marinated in sesame oil. The broth wasn't as authentic as I couldn't detect any dried tilefish or shrimp shells flavors. Nonetheless, it was still tasty and a well deserved 3/5.\n\nWe thought we should have at least one Vietnamese dish. Stir Fried Clear Noodle with Crab Meat ($12.95) was recommended to me although later, I had a strong suspicion that it might be more Thai like a chan pad poo using woonsen noodles (fun see or glass noodles). It didn't matter whether it was Thai or Viet but it just failed to push the right buttons. It lacked wok hay (boo!) and the sweet white crabmeat shriveled to dark brown that didn't taste like anything. The other ingredients like bean sprouts, carrots, green and yellow onions were equally ineffective. (2/5)\n\nBamboo was definitely a dive but that didn't bother me. The interior was a little tacky and gaudy with colored pics of every entr\u00e9e plastered all over the wall. That's the way it is in a lot of divey Chinese places. Why then 2 stars? To be blunt, the management's honesty was suspect. We didn't order much, the food was inexpensive and I was able to keep a mental tally on how much we spent, which was exactly $32.95 before tax. The check was scribbled illegibly in Chinese with a total of $44.27 presumably after tax and circled! Am I to believe that taxes on a $33 tab came up to a whooping $11 (tops maybe less than $4!)? Long story short, they have inadvertently added another entr\u00e9e to my check, which we never ordered and admitted to making an \"honest\" mistake! I don't read Chinese and would have been an easy target for their dishonesty had I not been more alert! All I can say is \"Beware\"! I wasn't too pissed at that time and still dropped off $5 as a tip. I got really upset after making a long trek back to my car! It was the kiss of death for Bamboo after realizing I was almost ripped off like that. 2 stars, 2 visits! Wouldn't be caught dead in there again!", "author": "Geoff G."}

Second, the red, spicy looking stuff that's supposed to be cooked into the broth was a clump of chili and lemon grass on the side of the bowl.

The first time we came we ordered the #6 Szechuan Chicken, #19 Crab Paste & Tomato Rice Noodle Soup, #603 Chicken Curry with French Bread, the #404  Three Color Rice Plate, and #89 Three Color Drink. Our server was very quiet and shy, but he was nice. I would really recommend the Szechuan Chicken! It has a good flavor and it comes out nice and hot. There is so much more on the menu we have yet to try. We want to come and try the Vietnamese sandwiches next time too!\n\nThe second time around, we came at a very busy time but luckily, there was still one table left for us to sit at. We had another pleasant experience of good service and great food. We ordered the #308 Rice Noodle Roll, #13 Combination Beef Noodle Soup, #18 Spicy Beef and Pork Rice Noodle Soup (Bun Bo Hue), and the #47 Beef Stew Rice Plate. The soup for the noodle soups were both cooked to perfection. The Beef Stew sauce was also flavorful and the beef was braised to a good chewy texture.  The Rice Noodle Roll was my absolute favorite of today's meal because it was not only unique but also masterfully made, and of course, tasty. \n\nWe forgot to try the Vietnamese sandwiches again so we are definitely coming back soon!", "author": "Regina L."}

Having passed by this place enough times I had to finally actually STOP and go inside.

Parking was a breeze because I found a parking spot right in front of the restaurant. I walked in and noticed that there were only 2 other people inside. Once I walked in I found a table and took my seat. The first thing I noticed was all the pictures on the walls of the menu items. That is ALWAYS helpful when confused about what the expected based on the listing in the menu. But, I already knew I wanted CURRY so I was able to order quickly. I also had to get a Thai Tea...I LOVE ME SOME THAI TEA!!!! As i waited for about  5 to 8 minutes for my food to be prepared I watched the latest episode of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\". I haven't seen that  show in so long. When my food finally came it was delicious. The curry smelled food and tasted MARVELOUS.

The restaurant is kind of like a hole-in-the-wall and either a hit or miss. It was kind of quiet and we were one of the only groups there.

The man taking our order was nice. \n\nTaste: \nI ordered the garlic noodles with chicken, my friend ordered some sort of fried rice, and we shared a plate of salt and pepper chicken wings. The wings were really good; they were nice and crispy, and had a good taste to it. The garlic noodles were not what I was expecting. By that I mean, usually the garlic noodles I have had are a yellow color, but this was a brown color probably because of added soy sauce and other condiments. The chicken was good, but the dish together had some disconnect, like it just didn't seem to go together for some reason.

He even came out to inspect my bowl to see if it was there (It was not). At the end I asked him where it was and he tells me that it was in there. A word of advise, if a customer asks you for an ingredient that wasn't in the meal, just bring it. There's no point in losing business over a quarters worth of ingredients and I will he lost ours.

Granted, I only ordered a Pho Ga with Rare Flank Steak, but it was decent enough.  Aside from the boatload of cilantro in my bowl (yes, I forgot AGAIN), I thought the broth was tasty and light.  Sadly, I've tried a couple of their other dishes since then, and I'm starting to think their pho may be the only thing worth getting.  Since their menu offered a few dishes I wanted to try, I ended up coming back a couple of times to try two of them out - the Five Spice Chicken and Garllic Noodles plate and the Pork Belly and Preserved Vegetable rice plate.  Too bad neither were very inspiring.\n\nWhile I really like the garlic noodles over at Perilla, I was hoping Green Bamboo could offer something comparable since parking here is so much more convenient.  Just looking at the noodles though, I already knew it was off.  While it tasted like garlic, the dish was more like chow mein - the noodles were dark (tossed with soy sauce it seems), included chunks of sliced red onions, and was not buttery at all.  As for the chicken, I liked the flavor and it was cooked fine, but they just didn't include much of it with the noodles.\n\nAs for the Pork Belly and Preserved Vegetable dish, I didn't expect it to be as good as the one my friend's aunt makes, but I thought it would be better than what I had.  For me, the thing I didn't like the most was the blend of spices they used.  I can't name the specific one that didn't agree with my taste buds, but it was potent enough where I couldn't taste anything else.  And even though they only gave three or four pieces of meat, it wasn't a problem.  It's not all that healthy anyways, but the belly had a weird texture to it as well.\n\nHad I written and posted this review after my first trip, I would have given them a three for their pho.  But with the other two in mind, (two and one respectively), I have to knock it down a level.  I might be okay with coming back for their pho, but I probably wouldn't go for anything else.

The common restroom is just okay. The wash basin is outside. I got the chicken sandwich for less than $5. It was below average. The chicken tasted old and yucky so I removed the chicken patty and fed it to my dog. The rest was just the bun and some veggie. It shouldn't cost more than $3.50. The serving girl was nice and gave me bowl of water for the dog. I was sitting outside since my dog was with me. My family ate inside and some liked and some did not. Price is reasonable.

The pho ga was exactly what my body needed after hiking in the cold and the BFs broth had a nice beefy taste. \n\nHalfway through our meal, we were the only guests there which was nice but as we left, more people arrived.

My fellow Yelpers weren't liking their pho too much and most people seemed to enjoy the garlic noodles.  Ok so there you go...I'm going to have me some garlic noodles.\n\nOrdered the 5 spice chicken with garlic noodles and the pork chop with garlic noodles.  Both were ok but heavy on the salt.  The garlic noodles were really garlicky (Just realize you will reek of garlic for awhile...I know I did...).  The 5 spice chicken was ok.  I think if they cooked the chicken  just a wee bit longer it would have made my meal more memorable.  The skin was too soggy for my taste.  The pork chop was also just ok.  It was heavily marinated and hence again really salty.  \n\nDowned 2 glasses of ice water and 2 pots of tea....so you can only imagine when I say salty - I mean the food was salty.\n\nWould I return? Hmmm...good question...I doubt it...", "author": "Cris H."}

It was our group of 4 and another table of 3.\n\nMy friend who doesn't eat red meat, ordered a shrimp b\u00fan dish. They brought out b\u00fan with meat and he returned it. They ended up taking out the meat and throwing the shrimp on top because he was still finding pieces of beef in his dish while eating it.\n\nI nearly forgot to mention that they had run out of a certain type of noodle. If 80-90% of your menu requires noodles, you would think of having a ready supply at all times. Considering it was only 5pm or so, there's no excuse to have run out of noodles.\n\nBad food.

The pho was terrible. It was honestly the worst pho I've ever had. The noodles didn't taste like they were cooked all the way through, the meat was tough and the broth was uninteresting and salty. I also ordered a Thai iced tea. Also worst Thai iced tea I've ever had in my life. I didn't think it was possible to make bad Thai iced tea, but they managed. It didn't taste much like Thai tea even though it was orange colored, instead it tasted like straight up high fructose corn syrup - probably an overdose of the mocha mix used to make it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-22", "description": "This restaurant just had it's \"grand opening\" a few months ago, but it really is just replacing the Vietnamese restaurant that was there before.  The menu looks like it's still the same (with the exception of slightly higher prices)and the food tastes the same as well.  That's a good thing because it's a pretty good restaurant.  I went back for the first time last night since it reopened.  I had originally wanted to try it on Monday, but it was packed and I didn't want to wait, so I ate a block away at Wonton House.\n\nI ordered #18 Bun Bo Hue(the Spicy Beef and Pork Noodle Soup) and my friend ordered the Lemongrass Chicken Over RIce.  We also got an order of the Chicken Cabbage Salad.  For drinks, I got a Red Bean Ice and he got a Mung Bean Ice.\n\nFirst off, the portions are huge!  The chicken cabbage salad was like a mountain of cabbage and chicken.  My friend commented that he thought there was too much fish sauce, but I like it that way, so it wasn't an issue for me.  The Bun Bo Hue (which is what the restaurant used to be named) was gigantic as well and chocked full of pork and  beef slices, tendons, and pig blood.  It's my first time getting that dish, so I can't really compare it to any other restaurants, but I thought it was decent.  The broth wasn't very spicy, and the chili oil seem to collect in certain areas of the soup, but I think I prefer the flavor of pho broth over it.  The meat and noodles, however, were quite yummy.\n\nI especially liked the red bean w/ coconut milk drink and I tried a sip of my friend's mung bean w/ coconut milk and it was equally delicious.  It is sweet, refreshing, and really coconut-ty.  Between the drink, the salad, and the noodle soup, I was stuffed and couldn't even finish my food.  That takes quite a lot of work because I can usually finish my portion, so that tells you how large our portions were.  My friend said that his lemongrass chicken was very good, but couldn't finish it either.  He ended up taking home what looked like half his plate.\n\nThe other thing that they have is set dinners.  The prices for these are really cheap, so you can bring a group of friends and eat at bargain prices.", "author": "Tyler C."}

Then again, it could just be all in my mind.\n\nI always get the vermicelli here because that's been my go-to dish since giving up beef and making it a rare occurrence. It's pretty good. You get a large amount for the price that you pay. But then again, quantity can never beat quality.\n\nThe service could be a little bit better but personally, I've never had a problem with them. The place is on the small side, but it's never been incredibly busy, except for this one time last Sunday when I was about to go with a couple of friends, but decided not to because of the crowd.\n\nSo, if you're in the neighborhood, in the mood for Vietnamese, and don't feel like walking five blocks to Irving, this place isn't that bad. It's not great, either. Personally, if I'm craving Vietnamese, I'll go to Irving. If I'm on Noriega and crave noodles, I'll go to Lanna Thai.

I would have to stay that in my whole life........I would have to say this place had the worst Vietnamese food ever. We are a family of 6 and after spending a day at Pier 39 we wanted some hot soup.  PHO !!  It just sounded so nice.   We yelped some Vietnamese restaurants and this place had a 3.5 star rating. So we got into the restaurant and we ordered Pho and other Vietnamese food.  Unfortunately It was the worst Vietnamese food ever.   Don't ever go here for Pho or any other Vietnamese food.  Unfortunately i have to tell everyone that It was the worst.  We ordered it and tasted awful and they still wanted us to pay.  The pork chops were fatty and the chicken didn't even look like chicken.  It may have been a rat or mice.   I ordered the beef stew with bread and it was the most disgusting thing ever. We immediately told our server the quality of food and taste was terrible and the chef came out to our table yelling at us. I couldn't believe it.  The meal and the experience was awful.     For your health and your pocket book I wouldn't ever step foot in this place.   I'm not quite sure how long they've been in business or if it's under new management but the people who gave  this place good ratings.  You're either their family and friends giving them good ratings but I'm  being totally honest !!! We left and came to San Mateo to eat at cheesecake factory.

Every time I've gone in there its dead quiet, unless you get the occasional pick up or to-go orders I see. I've had pho a few other places in the city, but I genuinely do like the food here. I don't think that 6 dollars for a HUGE bowl of pho is unreasonable. In fact when it comes, I questioned if they accidentally ordered the large instead. I couldn't even fathom that. And I always have leftover (which I usually eat later the same day as the noodles start to break apart after a while.) I tried their spring rolls, and I found it to be tasty and refreshing. I loved the peanut sauce it came with. And yes, I will agree that the staff doesn't pay much attention... but I have two things that I live by when it comes to service. 1. Don't hover. I don't like the staff coming around every 5-10 minutes to check in. Just let me eat.) 2. Make sure my water is refilled. I hate having to ask for water, and I really really hate having to ask for a refill. By default, I ask for water at the beginning of my meal considering some restaurants won't give you water unless you ask. Regardless, the well done beef and raw beef pho is great. And I love that it isn't so incredibly salty (a good indicator of MSG). With all the accompaniments, I usually leave always satisfied.
