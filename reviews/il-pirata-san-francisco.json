It's a good spot for it as well. Finally I consider myself a french fry connoisseur and Il Pirata serves excellent steak fries, the kind that pairs well with any beer.

First off - I tend to be an early guy, call me an early bird drinker. \n\nI Like: 1) Happy Hours  2) Being awake when I head out 3) early evening TV 4) Non-Club atmosphere most of the time.\n\nThis place has a clubby atmosphere later in the evening, but during the late afternoon, early evening it's a regulars kind of place. You see the same guys and gals when you go in here. There are 3 bartenders that I mostly recognize - the owner and his gf, and this guy John (I think) he reminds me of Danny at Molloys. Great bartenders making great drinks and this place is cheap. I order a manhattan from John and it comes in a bucket - a large rocks glass and it's made perfect every time. \n\nCheck it out - they've got a few tv's (play the Giants games!) and play good upbeat music, usually hip hop type that's not so loud you can't talk to the guy next to you.", "author": "Rew C."}

Parking right in front.\n\nWe walked in at 11:41am and were the only ones there.  Hmmm.  Was seated at a booth where the menus were a little sticky and my bf got a dirty water glass.  Not the best of starts but hey, in for a penny, in for a pound.  Wow, are we glad we stayed.  The service was super friendly.  I asked if they would put an egg on my pizza, and the girl serving us had never heard of that, but asked sweetly how it was done, then went and told the kitchen.  I could see them looking out at me like I was crazy, and they laughed, but they were good sports and agreed to do it.  And they did it perfectly!  \n\nThe pizza was DELICIOUS!  The egg was perfect on top, just cooked enough but left the yolk nice and runny.  The girl watched me smear it all around and said she was going to try it that way next.  But egg or no egg, their pizza was unexpectedly good!  I actually think it can hold a candle to Pizzeria Delphina or Beretta, but at 1/2 the price!  And no wait!  Amazing!

Pleasantly surprised.  \n\nWent the Sunday after Christmas, it was pretty dead inside - EXCEPT for a decent number of 49ers fans.  Had NO idea this place was a sports bar, guess it's not really, not sure what you'd classify it as actually, but it does have a good number of huge TVs for watching the game, and then also separate rooms w/ no TVs if that's not your thing. \n\nAs for the food, not the best I've ever had, some items better than others, but overall good experience.  Since we had the rest.com gift certificate we had to spend a minimum of $35 on food (pre-tax/tip).  At most SF places that's not difficult to do; here however, we ended up w/ 3 starters (steak bruschetta, classic salad, & wings) and two of the more expensive-ish entrees (chicken scallopini and chicken parm).   The bruschetta was a little oily for my taste but good.  Salad was really good, fresh, and a large portion.  The wings we just got to go b/c had so much food coming already (ate them the next day for lunch, pretty good, could have been hotter).  Both chicken dishes were good, nothing spectacular but met expectations (i.e. we weren't in North Beach and we knew that when we ordered, got what we expected). \n\nBest part of the meal were definitely the waitress (who I think was also the manager/owner?) and bartender.  Both seemed like great gals, knew the patrons coming in to watch the game by name, a good mood and smiling face can go a long way - particularly when eating a hungover lunch.  \n\nI think next time I'll come back for brunch, cheap menu with what looked like good cure for what ails you - pitchers of mimosas on an outdoor patio & pancakes would sure make me happy fast.", "author": "Mandi C."}

This was an amazingly awesome reversal:\n\nThe small crowd that was there was all a lot of fun to talk to and make friends with at the bar. Even as people got drunker and drunker, no one got all screaming team names/stupid team chants...thank god. I hate that frat boy shit. So, a chill, drunk crowd, all watching a game. Very cool. Oh yeah, the bartender had a old skool fire siren that he turned on when the Giants won at the end of the game...that is just plain funny :).\n\nThe burger I had was actually really really good.

A ton of seating for the lazy and over-worked. And the refreshing part that makes it different?

Come watch them play darts on their home game nights and you'll never believe people could shit talk so much and have such a good time (especially since they're playing darts - I know, darts!). \n\nDisclaimer:\n\nEven with it's variety of patrons, Il Pirata is truly a neighborhood bar at its core, so before you start planning your BART ride and bus route up from San Leandro, you should expect Cheers, not Coyote Ugly. \n\nIt's also the kind of place where you should check the schedule before you walk in, because the crowd changes drastically depending on the night's events. We're talking psych-trance raver-hippies one night, die-hard Giants fans another. Again, you can limit your interaction with these sorts by simply going into another room for the most part, but don't blame me if a braless hippie girl all painted and lit up like a psychedelic space alien with dread-locked pigtails asks you for a smoke outside. \n\nFood wise, avoid the garlic bread. The garlic part is not so much baked as it is chopped and placed raw on top of toasted, buttered bread, and it just isn't what you'd normally expect garlic bread to taste like. I would also skip the minestrone soup if it's on the menu when you go in. It's all pepper, no salt in my experience.  \n\nOtherwise, come as you are, order the pizza and if you have a sense of humor, a Bud Light Lime (ha!) or a car bomb and enjoy the space.", "author": "Kat E."}

They told me that Sundays are busy at Il Pirata with the grill that would be raging with tons of food and the DJ would be spinning reggae all day and night and rastafarians (both real and wannabe) would be aplenty.  OK, so the DJ showed up but no food and no people.  Granted it was Easter Sunday and we did show up at 4pm which in my terms is kind of early.  However, by the time 8pm rolled around there were a few more people and the DJ was spinning a nice (although not very good with the transitions) set of both dancehall, roots, and dub reggae and marijuana smoking was done freely and frequently (as one would expect with a reggae club) so that was a plus.\n\nThe interior of Il Pirata is actually pretty big.  Once you walk in the front door there's a decent sized bar area and then the next room which is the main dance room, was pretty big and roomy.  But the plus is the two big outdoor areas, one in the back with lots of tables and the grills however too many trees blocking the sun...the second outdoor area was to the side facing the street.  So I definitely was digging the size of the place.  Now the real plus is the $2 Red Stripes.  Hard to beat that deal.  \n\nThe only real knock on Il Pirata is it's location.

It was during the day so we weer able to enjoy the patio (one of two by the way, extra star for that).\n\nThe bar was divided into two areas which was nice. I liked that. It means if there's a band or DJ, you can still sit at the bar and actually have a conversation. Then, if you hear your favorite song, get up and be \"all up in it\" within a few steps.\n\nTwo outdoor patios, super score. Both very pleasant equipped with heat lamps and terraces. I didn't spend much time here but I will certainly hit it up on another nice and sunny afternoon for some cocktails or happy hours.", "author": "alexa c."}

I'll be taking the bus from Inner Richmond back here (yes, worth the haul) again soon. Strong drinks (but I started with a beer, which tasted flat to me, so I switched). Nice, real people, patrons... the place was full of obvious regulars. So refreshing to find a place with no hipsters and no one that thinks spending $100+ on a pair of jeans is perfectly normal.

Sat in a booth with my girlfriend, and we ordered a greek salad, bruschetta, spaghetti and meat balls, and a couple beers. The server was polite and brought our food when it was ready, but basically left us alone, which I really like. This is no 4 star place, so don't expect to be waited on excessively. The food was really good. Nothing fancy, but it was very well put together. The Bruschetta has huge chunks of tomato, basil and mozzarella, and you scoop it on yourself. The spaghetti came with a healthy 3 very large meatballs, cut in half - more than enough for a good balance with the pasta. The Greek salad was also simple but very tasty, with very flavorful olives, and a good mix of the right kind of veggies. We didn't venture into the bar area except to peek around, but it seemed like a local dive, with an assortment of intersting people, who were friendly and jovial. The food was very reasonably priced-$ 5.95 bruschetta, $8 spaghetti I think. I'll be back for sure. Thanks for a great meal Il Pirata!!\n\nOrdered some takeout again tonight. still 5 stars. great meal - and on a nice sunny day, there is a killer back patio. So rare these days.

The place was filled to less than 1/3 of its total capacity. \"Good, it won't take too long to get a bite to eat.\" I sat down knowing exactly what I wanted.\n\nAfter being seated, 20 minutes later a waitress had taken my order. Just a small pizza pie.\n\n10 minutes go by.\n\nThen 30.\n\nThen 45.\n\nFinally at 60, my waitress offers to give my a \"salad\" on the house because my pizza was taking to long.

I couldn't finish it.\n\nAfter waiting another 15 minutes, I decided I had better places to be, and left before I ever got my pizza after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting.

The event started at 9:00p but folks came through around 8:30p and ordered food. The staff and owners are really friendly. The drinks were affordable and most importantly the vibe of the crowd was nice and easy. My favorite part of Il Pirata are the outdoor patios. There's one in the back and one right by the front entrance. Since the venue was packed it was nice to have patios for the crowd to pour out into especially since it got stuffy.

I found it by tagging along on a pub crawl where every location had a beer garden (best theme ever) and we ended the night at Il Pirata. They have a variety of spaces but the main draw is the awesome beer garden which is a great size and surrounded by trees. It feels like noise is not an issue because the area is mostly industrial. There is a huge BBQ which we got to use with the understanding that all alcohol would be purchased at the bar. It was a Saturday night and unexpectedly empty (seems like they would be more popular for the after-work crowd because of the location) and we had almost full run of the place. The bartender was friendly and the prices were good.\nOverall I would describe Il Pirata as a low-key, comfortable, spacious, cleaner version of the Zeitgeist.", "author": "Cyrelle D."}

I highly recommend her empanadas but don't stop there; her \"platos\" are slamming as well.  Regulars know to head to the patio 1st and buy their food up front as she is usually sold out by midnight.  If you get the itch for another salsa party of the same caliber but can't wait until the ultimate Friday, the same dj's spin at Little Baobob on 19th (info is on their website www.anejoprod.com.)
