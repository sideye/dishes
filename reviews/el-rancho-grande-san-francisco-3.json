I was in San Francisco for my annual conference and this restaurant was very close to the place I lived in. This was my last day here so I wanted to try Cal-Mex because Tex-Mex is almost everywhere in the DC area. \n\nSo as usual I enter and check out their menu to see if they have something out of the ordinary. I immediately notice their California Burrito . It comes with your choice of meat, crispy fries, guacamole and cheese. Then I checked their price and it was very nominal compared to other restaurants in San Francisco. So one would imagine a small portion for a relatively low price but don't go by their pricing as their portions are huge. I am not exaggerating when I say it's huge, it really is. \n\nI bite into this huge burrito and I immediately experience Nirvana ;well I might be a little over doing here , but trust me it was so delicious that I ordered another and took it back on my flight. I could eat only half of it and I ate the rest on my way to the Airport. I am so glad I packed one for my trip as we found out on the plane that they did not have dinner service. I felt a little guilty though that I have this amazing burrito and most of the others had to stick with snack boxes. I definitely recommend this place.", "author": "Rumesh V."}

But people do not realize that the Haight-Ashbury also have a few good spots for a bite.  \n\nThis somewhat-new taqueria makes some pretty mean and authentic food here. My first visit, I had my usual \"Super\" silver bullet with grilled steak. For a reasonably priced $8.50, I get grilled steak that is seasoned with the restaurant's own blend of spices, choice of beans, rice, cheese, salsa, avocado, and sour cream in a flour tortilla. The meat is spiced very well with a well-balance of the charred and smoky flavor that does not leave a burnt aftertaste. I like my cheese in my burrito slightly melted. And the cheese has a very nice sharp taste. Overall, the burrito is solid. \n\nI liked the food and friendly service from here so much that I returned a few days later for an early dinner. This time, I had the \"Super\" nachos. For the same $8.50, I get the same meat and same condiments all pile on top of flaky tortilla chips. We all know that this is a messy and unattractive dish. But the grilled meat, melted sharp cheese and the somewhat cold sour cream is a difference-maker. \n\nBoth of my recent visits, I had bottled brews with my grub. And this taqueria have a decent selection with a few micro-brews.\n\nThis taqueria does accept credit cards.

It'd be much better if they served this hot, on request. \n\nTacos - I got the lengua and tripa- I was so excited that they even had these on the menu!!! The amount of meat they put in their tacos is generous. However, again, I just got from Mexico and had the most amazing tripa tacos there... these don't compare. The tripa was somewhat stale, as if it had been cooked a long time ago and was heated up again for my taco. It didn't have that burst of flavor and fattiness and juiciness when you bite into a piece of tripa, just some stale chewiness.\nThe lengua was extremely tender and cooked very well, however it needed to be marinated a lot more because there wasn't any flavor to it. I had to add a lot of their salsa to get some flavor, which resulted in a very wet taco. \n\nThe price is about $5/taco (expensive! although they do load on the stuff) and $10/burrito which is normal for SF. \n\nThis place has great potential..

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-16", "description": "Definitely an improvement over the dreary El Faro, and there's promise in the food here, but also a couple of problems -- the main one being the flat screens at blasting volume, creating an almost unbelievable din even when the place is virtually empty. On my first visit, the food was quite good. I had two super tacos -- one with pollo en salsa and the other with carnitas -- and a side of black beans. The guacamole that came with the tacos was really delicious, as were the black beans, which were subtly aromatic with spices (it's the little things). The pollo was a little less spicy than I'd hoped; it was basically just chunks of white-meat chicken, but it was really moist and fresh tasting. The carnitas were soft rather than slightly crispy (two different styles, I know), but they were very good. And all the salsas on the side were really delicious and bright. The flat screen downstairs was blasting at top volume *over* the Mexican Muzak; no one was watching it, and it made that room uninhabitable. But the upstairs room was blessedly quiet, and the chairs were comfortable. I was eager to return.\n\nAlas, my second visit was much less successful. Again, I ordered two super tacos: one carne asada and one shrimp, no rice (I can't eat it), with a side of black beans. The bill seemed extraordarily high, but I shrugged it off. I went upstairs to discover that, this time, the flat screen upstairs was on and as loud as the one downstairs. The competing cacophony was unbelievable, but in each room, there seemed to be one person watching, so I let it be. This time, my tacos took about 20 minutes to come, which seemed rather long, but when I got them, I saw why the bill had been so high: I had been given two shrimp tacos, which have a $2 surcharge each, plus a carne asada. Alas, all three tacos were piled high with rice, which got tangled up with all the lettuce and guacamole, so I ended up having to pick through these heaps of rice/lettuce looking for pieces of meat and shrimp, which, I must say, were laughably few (if it wasn't for all that rice, they never would have sent out the tacos with such little meat, because it would have been too obvious.) So I ended up eating a bunch of rice that stuck to the lettuce, and here I am with a big ol' glucose spike (I checked) right before my a1c test (it's a diabetic thing). I walked home dejected past Street Taco, which, in classic Woody Allen fashion, was full of laughing happy people eating delicious-looking plates of food. I'll give this place at least another chance, because the food was so good the first time, but the flat screen situation is really unfortunate. It's almost amazing to me that the workers themselves don't seem to mind the noise.", "author": "Steve S."}

When I went to pay, this new cashier who I had not seen before repeated my order and I noticed my order was wrong so I let her know. Instead of offering to fix it, this new cashier just kept looking at me as if she wanted me to take it anyways. Normally it wouldn't have been a problem, but this really isn't what I ordered so repeated again that the order was wrong. She got upset and told the cooks in Spanish that I had given the wrong order (not true). She then told them to do all the other orders first and to fix mine last. I know Spanish so I was blown away by this level of unprofessionalism. She then told me in English I would have to wait an additional 20 mins (I ordered in advance for a reason)!
