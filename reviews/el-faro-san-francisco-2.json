The owner was a customer of mine in the real estate market and wanted to expand to a sit-down restaurant on Polk St. I encouraged him to keep a good thing going and he explanded El Faro into the financial district. It lasted a few years and now they are down to El Camino and the original Mission location.\n      Business has been slow due to competition and at one time there were 6 or 7 employees turning out the orders. I always get a super burrito. I consider it among the best in the bay area. If you don't know any Spanish it may be difficult to order changes as many of the affected reviewers seem to demand. I take what they make and its good. With a cold beer or a soda its worth it. They have a clearly written menu describing what is in the particular dish. I cannot comment on the other meals because I am addicted to their super pork, beef, or chicken burritos. I said super, you have to get all the trimmings added to make them nice and juicy. The negative comments here are not justified but the result of poor education and upbringing from BAS-s. (bay area slobs) If you are dissatisfied, make your own Mexican food. Or go to Taco Bell. a good place too for fast food.", "author": "Andrew B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-09-29", "description": "My husband and I have been going to El Farro in the Mission since we were teenagers, over 20 years.  Since we don't live close to them, and have to drive a bit to get there, we considered them a special treat.  We decided yesterday was going to be the day.  We drive across the city to pick up dinner only to be greeted with the worst experience ever, anywhere.\n\nWe order the usual super burrito for our son and two Mexican sandwiches for ourselves.  The woman making the food was someone we'd never seen before and was the only person behind the counter making food.  The only other person there was a man running the register who said he was the Manager.  She didn't know how to make the food we've been buying for years.  The burrito was rolled very loose and the sandwiches were not made according to their usual standards.  Mind you, we hadn't bought them yet.  We saw this by watching her make the food through the glass.\n\nShe didn't understand what we were asking her to do, like not put our lettuce on the hot grill to prevent wilting, or to make one spicy and the other not.  So we spoke to the \"Manager\", or attempted to anyway.  He ignored us, wouldn't acknowledge we were talking to him, until my husband got loud.  Then he proceeds to say \"it's just a sandwich\".  We argued that because we're customers paying for \"just a sandwich\", it should be made the way we want it, the way it's always been made in the past, citing hot lettuce as an example.  His response... \"lots of people do it that way\".   I was absolutely stunned that he didn't care the food wasn't being made according to their usual standards, or that the customer is saying it isn't right.  He absolutely did not care, stood there shrugging his shoulders and again said \"geez, it's just a sandwich, don't have a heart attack over it\".  \n\nMy response... I'm having a \"heart attack\" because you act like you don't care and that makes you look like an a@#hole that doesn't care about your customers.  He agreed he didn't.  with that said, we vowed to never return and made sure he knew he was loosing good, long time customers.  We'll never go back.  \n\nThe food is good, don't get me wrong.  But I can't spend my hard earned money in a business that could care less about the customer, and be so open with it.  He thought the food was fine, didn't care that the burrito would fall apart, or that the lettuce was served hot in a sandwich.  In his opinion it was fine and that's all there was to it.\n\nIt may be \"just a sandwich\", but it's that sandwich, and that burrito, and that taco that pays your bills buddy.  No customers, no money.  No money, no business.  It's simple.  Take care of your customers, especially those who've been with you for more than 20 years.  They don't deserve to be in business treating people that way.", "author": "Bobbie T."}

My burrito was wrapped to go and upon unveiling of my post lunch time meal my dry burrito was pretty wet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-19", "description": "My quest to find a quality burrito in San Francisco marches on....\n\nI don't understand what the problem is. Burritos have to be the easiest comfort food item on the planet to whip together. Get some refried beans, some rice (but not too much), a meat item and a few peripheral additions... wrap that shits in a grilled (not steamed!) tortilla, and you've got a meal. \n\nBut seriously, though... what the fuck? In a city filled with talented culinary professionals, why can't someone figure out how to make a decent burrito? I know that's a generalization, and there are places that *do* exist, which will likely put the brakes on my bitching and complaining... but failed attempt after failed attempt just has me so very aggravated.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, El Faro would probably nab a 2 on the scale of tasty burritos in San Diego... but sadly, in San Francisco, this was the best burrito I've had yet. It was of the breakfast variety, and it had a very slight resemblance to what I was raised on. Eggs, bacon, refried beans, cheese and hot sauce. On paper, it should have been a knock out... but it was just OK at best. \n\nSomething I seriously don't under stand is why every Mexican food joint in SF heats up their burritos with a panini press? From first hand experience, there isn't a goddamn food purveyor anywhere in Mexico that uses a contraption like that to heat up a tortilla, or the entire burrito for that matter. They use a flat grill or an open flame. \n\nAnd the wrapping... don't even get me started. When steaming a burrito in a press, it adds condensation to the tortilla. Then, when you wrap it in tin foil, it not only expedites the spread of wetness, it also locks in the moisture and causes the entire burrito to become a soggy, sloppy mess. Again, in Mexico and San Diego where the burrito has been perfected, there isn't a legitimate taco shop anywhere that double-wraps a steamed burrito in tin foil... it's always paper. Seems easy enough to fix, right? Well, apparently not in El Faro's case, or the case of many others in the city. \n\nEl Farolito is my last hope.

I was actually looking to see if this old heavy set guy who always sat on a stool was still there. Sure enough he was seating in the back on a regular chair with a walker. The  guy looks the same, I asked about the other heavy set guy who owned the place, The guy passed away about 10 yrs ago. Burritos were watery no flavor, just not the same. Nothing last forever.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-16", "description": "I've been here a few times in my life, and about ten years ago (when I was five), I remember eating their burritos, and liking them. Quite frankly, now, the burritos are sub-par, the wettest burritos I have EVER eaten. They only use refried beans, sour cream, cheese (mozzarella, I think), jalapenos, a bit of hot sauce, rice (no salsa), extremely watered down guacamole, and the meat they use is loaded with liquid in itself. When I eat the burrito, I literally have to slurp the contents to eat it. Also, they steam the tortillas, which I found kind of absurd, making the burrito somewhat flimsy, requiring the tin foil to support it. The burritos are really small for a \"super burrito\" and costs $8.34 for something that's not super filling. Though the texture of the burrito isn't great, the flavors actually do make up for it. The only thing in the burrito that has a decent non-liquidy texture are the jalapenos. Still, what tipped me off, for this terrible review of their restaurant, was the service. There were three or four employees inside. It was around 6:40 pm, and the sign posted said that they closed at 7. So I knocked on their door to get their attention that I was a customer and wanted food. The old guy (I think was the boss) stares at me, and just ignores me. Then, the three female employees looked up at me, and also ignored me, making clear that they saw me. I pounded on the door, at least waiting to at least speak to them, or hint that they were closed. But no, they just ignored me, doing their thing. I thought they would at least be courteous enough to at least speak/gesture to me. What ticked me off, was their lack of respect for their customers--I truly felt like just flipping them off for their rudeness. Next time, I'm going on Mission St. to find a place with manners and better food.", "author": "Steven Z."}

I definitely have other places I prefer, but the siren song of the super chicken burrito still lures me to the corner of 20th and Folsom. This may have been the first SF burrito place I tried back in 1976 (or possibly the long lost Antojitos Mexicanos on Mission) when I first came here, so I have fond memories. Like how I mastered eating a burrito while bicycling to my busboy gig at MacArthur Park from SF State. What a skill! So, I admit this is no La Corneta, the food still hits a spot for old timers like me. Well, actually only the chicken burrito hits a spot. It is the sauce and the blending of the ingredients in the \"super\" that does it for me. As an aside, La Taqueria, on Mission near 25th, does a great taco (through all the various owners...although I must admit I like the the Warrior's fans the best, the folks who ran it in the 80's and 90's...the wife of the couple would hold up the line while Purvis Short was at the line, god what dedication to the cause of bay area hoops!)
