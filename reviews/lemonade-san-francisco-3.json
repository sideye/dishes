Fresh, light, and very delicious American Style food. Their menu is very reminiscent of the food you'd find at a picnic. The way you order is easy! Cafeteria style, grab a tray, pick out what you want. There's a Land & Sea option, Poke Bowl, Marketplace or go Ala Cart! All the dishes is laid out for you to see. Salads and pastas, sandwiches, fishes and chicken, and side orders.

When I was here I ordered the Market Place option, which includes 4 choices of different kinds of salad/pasta dishes. The Soba Vegetarian Noodles dish was definitely a winner! Their mash potatoes is really good as well!

During this last visit, I opted for the combo for 1 hot sandwich, 1 side, and complimentary chips. The balsamic chicken sandwich I had would've been pretty tasty if the bread weren't so stale. It was tough biting into that sandwich. While the mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious, the curry cauliflower did not impress at all. The chips were also pretty stale as well. Portion size was also fairly small for the (nearly) $13 price tag.\n\nService was great. As this is a cafeteria-style establishment, we were greeted when we walked in, and were nicely guided through the process. They also bring out your food if you order a hot item, so do remember to grab your number! You can also skip the line and head to the register if plan to only order a drink. Hygiene, on the other hand, left much to be desired. There were too many flies laying around and sticky tables galore. The restroom was also sticky and stinky. Parking and traffic are difficult in the area, so definitely stick to public transportation if possible.

I used to eat Lemonade almost every day back in LA when we had one on campus. Sunshine & fresh go very well together. \nSimilar to other Lemonades, there are four different sections: 1) cold (market) dishes, 2) land & sea (like poached salmon, ahi tuna) 3) sandwiches, and 4) hot dishes like braised meats and mac n cheese (try the truffle)! It can get confusing as a newcomer, but remember, if you want the hot plates or sandwiches, you can skip the line of folks getting their market sides to the respective section. You can also try samples of everything, and they always make sure to ask if you have any allergies. \n\nLemonade changes their menu periodically. They have seasonal specials, which are great, but I always find myself deferring back to my usuals. These are my favorite market sides:\n- Curried cauliflower with almonds\n- Pineapple chicken with green beans \n- Soba noodles \n- Roasted butternut squash (they have this crunchy corn nut-like things in here, that make it SO good)\n- Avocado & cherry tomatoes (sometimes there are way too many cherry tomatoes left in the batch - I'm out)\n- Orecchiette pasta & cherry tomatoes \n\nFor hot dishes:\n- Truffle mac n cheese (treat yoself!)\n- Roasted brussel sprouts\n- Roasted cauliflower (this is SUPER flavorful. And it's wonderfully crispy)\n- Beef stroganoff (this location does not have it...)\n\nFor desserts:\n- Their macarons are probably the largest size I've seen sold out there. They do a great job.\n\nIt can get overwhelming because of all the options, so make sure you grab a menu to scope out the prices or ask someone (everyone is friendly!) before you get surprised at the register.

So after hearing all the buzz about this place from peeps in SoCal, I've been wanting to stop by and check out one of their locations ever since they've been popping up all over the Bay. I've been holding out waiting for the Berkeley location to open on 4th street but I haven't heard anything new happening there (you guys still opening there or nah? haha) so I finally found an opportunity go out of my way and see what I've been missing out on. \n\nI was coming from the gun control march in SF so after all the walking, I pretty much decided ahead I was going to end up just taking out which I kinda regretted as soon as I walked in: very bright cafeteria style decor, friendly atmosphere, very clean and spacious with lots of outdoor seating that I love. Everyone was very friendly. Very welcoming vibe that made me just want to sit down and enjoy my meal there but alas, I was on the move. I ordered:\n\nWatermelon Rosemary - Didn't blow my mind but very refreshing drink and exactly what I needed to top off a very long day. Would try again (along with other flavors of course)\n\nCitrus Poached Salmon Fillet - Melt in your mouth good. I was pleasantly surprised as I'm naturally skeptical of salmon in chain restaurants but this salmon was legit. \n\nWhite Truffle Mac n Cheese -  Must try! Very creamy, savory and delicious. Everyone I know that's been here raves about the mac n cheese and it definitely lived up the hype. \n\nRoasted Brocoli - Not as amazing as the other two sides but still solid and worth trying. \n\nAll healthy sized portions and while this place definitely isn't cheap, for the quality and portions, I looked at my receipt ($22.50) not feeling too jipped.

Upon entering there seemed to be a long cafeteria style counter to the right with a long line in font so I dutifully queued up. I tried finding a menu board but could not identify one or at-least find one that explained what I could get. What struck me about this place was the silence. It was like everyone was here to attend a funeral. I guess this is what a super snobby place feels like. Most people in line seemed to be regulars who knew what they wanted. It looks like there are a bunch of different salads, sandwiches and entrees that you can choose from and they finally ring you up for what you've got.\n\nAfter a quick look around I decided to get a sandwich and a side salad. I think I chose the kale salad ($5.50) and a salmon salad sandwich ($8.50) but I'm not 100% sure. The arrogant person behind the salad section rushed me through but forgot to give me any dressing for the salad which made it impossible to eat. The person who took the sandwich order was equally snooty. I'm not sure if they allow sandwiches to be customized at this funeral service so I stuck with their standard options (else I'd select a type of bread and ask for it to be toasted).\n\nThe sandwich was fine, but I would have liked it a lot more if it was toasted. The salad on the other had was in-edible without the dressing. I'm not sure if there is like a common station with dressing that I missed but I'm not that hardcore to be able to eat raw vegetables. Price-wise, Lemonade is definitely one of the more expensive places to eat in FiDi. I understand that it is targeted at a certain clientele, so all that I'll say is - Thank You but I'll pass.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

The location was close, the lines were short, and the serving size of the poke was respectable. It was also pretty yummy; solid mid-grade poke. The surprise stand-out was the shaved brussels sprouts and dates, which was quite yummy, even though it seemed like the server hadn't exactly packed the box tight. The price was a little higher than I usually pay for a lunch, but it seemed pretty worth it.\n\nThe second date didn't go as well; there was no rice ready so I tried branching out to noodles and it was pretty meh. To make matters worse, the box of brussels sprouts was visibly empty on one end, making me feel a little disgruntled. But, no one's perfect, and everyone has off days.\n\nI went for the \"spicy\" fin poke bowl the third time around, and though there's nothing detectably spicy about it, it was the best of the bowls I'd had. I skipped the salad that time because I wasn't as hungry, and I felt like Lemonade had redeemed itself.\n\nFinally I went back again, getting my favorite bowl and asked how much salad was in a serving. \"About a scoop and a half,\" Lemonade's besties told me. I looked at the generously-sized scoops and thought, \"Ah, it must have just been a mistake before.\" It was not, however; this was no heaping, generous scoop, it was a carefully-leveled scoop, plus about half of another carefully leveled scoop. When they handed me the box, a large portion of it was clearly empty.\n\n\"Why is it empty?\" I asked.\nLemonade's besties looked embarrassed. \"That's a two-serving box, so...\"\nI looked at the small box incredulously, and back to the besties. \"Really?\"\nAgain Lemonade's besties could only look apologetic, and I felt a little sorry for them, having to cover for their cheap friend like that. Not their fault.\nAt first I shrugged it off and started to just get the check, but then I thought to myself, \"You know what? There's plenty of restaurants in the sea,\" and gave back the sad little box of salad.\n\nThe poke was still pretty good when I got back to the office, but it was a bit bitter to think that there'd never be more than that.

You go down the line with your tray, asking the staff for what you want and then pay when you reach the end of the line. \n\nSince the last time I ate here, the staff have begun to serve the marketplace items in little dishes, making the servings a little smaller. Still, I feel like you get a decent amount for what you're paying.\n\nI used to buy two marketplace items and one protein, but I find that the portions between their protein and marketplace dishes is too similar to warrant the price difference, especially since a lot of marketplace items have chicken or fish in them.

Going down the line, you're introduced to their cold sides first, but if you opt out in order to see what's good at the main courses/hot sides, the line is already so long that going back to see the cold sides is kind of awkward/weird. Maybe this is just my personal preference and anxieties kicking in, but I guess I'd rather just have it be an order and then sit down restaurant like Panera style instead of this weird line thing. \n\nHowever, the ambiance is adorable. The yellow, like a lemon, gives it a fresh vibe that I adore. Good amount of outdoor seating which is great if it's a nice day. Unfortunately, the indoor seating is really limited which makes it tough if the weather isn't as great.\n\n[Food]: I ended up ordering the Poke and the roasted broccoli. I have to admit, they were both fantastic. However, they were both incredibly small portions. I paid $11 for two little cups of them which was disappointing, especially since I could get a big poke bowl for the same price. Ended up not even bothering with buying a lemonade because it'd run me another $4. Sucks because I know the lemonade here is some of the best! Side note, I noticed that they changed their Salmon Louie from an avocado half stuffed with salmon into a mixed salad which I think was a smart move. \n\n[Service]: Employees were kind and let me try both the Poke and the Salmon Louie first before solidifying an decision which I appreciated! That's another perk of being cafeteria style I suppose. \n\nAll in all, I like Lemonade - I really do! But it ends at there.

On any given day there's about 8-12 pretty clean salads, proteins, or sandwiches and almost as many lemonades at the register as well. \n\nIt seems somewhat inexpensive, but after add ons and ordering a lemonade (which is almost impossible not to do at a place called Lemonade) you're sitting at somewhere near $20 for a lunch. Not the most cost efficient place to eat at everyday, but if you want a splurge it is a pretty nice treat. Enjoy!", "author": "Danny W."}

I opted for the vegetarian options each time. This box is plenty to fill you up, but not leave you bloated and feeling uneasy for the rest of the afternoon. \n\nOverall, Lemonade has a bit of a chainy feel to it: everything is so organized, clean and - somewhat rigid.

Walking in, I was a little confused as to how I was supposed to order. I grabbed a tray and noticed that each dish had a price sign attached to them. Basically you pay by each serving. \n\nI decided to order the butternut squash with red quinoa as I had no idea what other foods were available down the line. The server gave me a plate with the squash and quinoa as well as a number. When I got to the hot food section, I decided on the truffle Mac and cheese as well as the red miso short ribs. The mac and cheese as well the red miso short ribs came in a cup size container. As I reached the cashier, I was asked for my number and I ordered the pomegranate and tarragon lemonade. I mean, it is called Lemonade for a reason!\n\nThe butternut squash and red quinoa ($2.95) didn't wow me. It tasted like raw squash with cooked quinoa. Maybe that's what it was supposed to taste like but normally butternut squash has a bit more of a flavor profile.  \n\nThe red miso ribs ($7.95) had smaller pieces that could be pulled apart with just a fork but the pieces that are big were a bit on the dry end and there wasn't enough sauce for me to continually dip pieces in. The flavor was there but I'd request more sauce next time. \n\nThe truffle mac and cheese ($4.50) didn't disappoint. If I ever want a cheesy snack, I'll come back and get this!\n\nLastly the pomegranate tarragon lemonade was a bit of a disappointment. It was too tart and the tarragon overtook the flavor of the lemonade. I drank about half of it before I decided I couldn't have more of the medicinal and tart taste. It wasn't sweet at all. Next time I'll ask for a sample first. \n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, you should be careful of costs. My meal costed $21 because everything just added up. You do get full off of portion sizes but if you don't want to have a $20 lunch, you may want to browse before you order. \n\nI know their lemonades are well known and I did enjoy the mac and cheese so I will be back again!", "author": "Olivia C."}

Lines get long but I really like their fresh food and the service was always great!\n\nHowever, about 2 weekends ago a group of friends and I came here on a saturday and had a truly confusing experience. Apparently they were training a lot of new hires so almost everything you could imagine go wrong did go wrong. A different big group went before us and ordered, for some reason when it came time to pay they decided they didn't want the food and left. I don't know what happened but I do know that afterwards their employees took their anger out on us. \n\nApparently the  previous group ordered a sandwich I had also ordered, so the employee tried to give it to me. I was fine with it because it was unopened and I don't want to waste perfectly good food, no one touched it so I said it was fine. The manager (who was also my cashier, and I'm only assuming is the manager because he was bossing people around) came behind the employee and reprimanded her in front of me. He told her that it was illegal and they cannot give food to another person then he told her to go \"back into the kitchen\" and she didn't say anything and walked back to the kitchen...it was really, really uncomfortable. \n\nThey did mess up on our order and charges, one lady apologized to us and said they were training 6 new people so it was hectic. One friend paid for a meal but was only given a sandwich--we waited for TWENTY minutes and they never brought over his chips/side, when he went to ask they said it wasn't included...what...we literally all ordered the same thing except with different salads but his salad wasn't included?? Made 0 sense, they told us that the other 4 of us shouldn't have gotten salads. Um...no...this is literally on your menu. The worst part? My sandwich was made so poorly it fell apart on my lap when we finally sat down to eat. What a bummer.\n\nWill I be back?

Some of my friends, on the other hand, were rather stoked to have another light and fresh option for lunch downtown.  And here I was, thinking they were all about lemonade, like Hot Dog on a Stick (minus the giant stomper thing they use to juice the lemons).\n\nSince I wasn't all that familiar with Lemonade (obviously), I didn't really know what to expect the first time I came here.  Their set-up was a little confusing initially, but I actually liked how you can walk up directly to each station rather than work your way down a line cafeteria-style (though perhaps not during the lunch rush).  Especially since the two times I've been here, I was able to skip the cold selections and go straight to their sandwiches!\n\n-- GANDOLFINI - Turkey, Chicken, Ham, Swiss, Pepperoncini, and Olives...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=4nn8NdESKCDqal0NG6bpAQ)\nI knew immediately I wanted to try this when I saw it.  The ingredients may not be super unique, but it looked so good!  There was a decent amount of all three meats, the cheese was uber gooey, andI liked the bitterness of the arugula.  Even the olives weren't too shabby.  I especially liked the bread though, which was soft and just lightly toasted.\n\n-- AHI TUNA & AVOCADO POKE with Tangerines, Icicle Radish, and Sesame...$6.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=op5-6NIDedN0cRZQlJoFCA)\nI figured it was going to be overpriced (and it was, based on the portion size), but I had been craving some poke pretty badly.  While it wasn't super flawed, I thought it was just okay. The tuna was pretty fresh, as were the rest of the ingredients, but I didn't care much for the sauce the used, which was fairly sharp/acidic.\n\n-- BLOOD ORANGE LEMONADE...$3.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=Fn9_wmUJErYOj8c50jKhPw)\nI was torn between this one and their regular lemonade, but the girl at the register mentioned this was her favorite.  After just a couple of sips, I could definitely see why!  While it's a little sweet, I liked the overall taste, as well as the bit of tartness from the blood orange.\n\n-- GUAVA LIMEADE...$3.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=EnTAQ5TKfndHQlB3GoZU9Q)\nI would've ordered the Blood Orange Lemonade again, but I had to try this one for the guava.  Unlike the lemonade, this was more sour than sweet, though I was fine with that (it's limeade, after all).  I do wish there was a bit more guava to it, but I'd definitely get this again!\n\n-- TURKEY \"EL TIJUANA\" with Jicama Slaw, Queso Fresco, Avocado, and Jalapeno Aioli...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=Gglr5xYcf9TDwVeC0W_N6A)\nNot as tasty as the Gandolfini, but solid nonetheless.  The turkey, queso fresco, and avocado blended well together, the bread was just as good, and the jalapenos and aioli were great (the heat wasn't super intense).  The jicama slaw didn't do much for me (it didn't add a lot of flavor), but it did provide a nice, refreshing crunch.\n\n-- WHITE TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE...$4.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=SmsZULk0SzEnjqL5XFVmmw)\nDespite how I wish the consistency of the sauce was gooier/cheesier, this was great!  The noodles were were perfectly tender and there was a good amount of truffle flavor in the dish.  Something like toasted breadcrumbs would be nice to add some texture, but it's a minor quibble.\n\nWhile I can't say how this Lemonade compares to its brethren in LA, it does seem like the prices here are a shade higher based on the online menu's on their homepage.  However, even with that in mind, I'm more inclined to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS since I haven't had any major problems with them.  I wouldn't make it a point of coming back to this one, but I'm sure I'll visit their West Portal and 9th Ave locations when they open, if only for their sandwiches and another refreshing lemonade/limeade!", "author": "Mike L."}

Too bad unlike her album, this place left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nTbh, we settled on Lemonade because the Super Duper Burger line was seemingly endless. Aside from the short line, eating at Lemonade was a poor decision. The restaurant was out of nearly half of their featured menu to the point where my boyfriend ended up settling for the truffle mac&cheese (his 4th choice). Some of you may argue that this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when there aren't enough appealing entree options available forcing you to settle on a side, I beg to disagree. I hoped that since it was a Saturday evening, there would be an overflow of food options given that this is a bustling city and it was dinner time. I was wrong. To my dismay, I even had to settle for a less desired option myself. \n\nWhat went wrong? As for one of the reasons given to me by the shift supervisor, the wrong chicken was ordered for the mango chicken bowl that my boyfriend initially wanted. They only had enough from a prior batch to feed a small subset of people. This, I let slide but for 2 more entrees to be unavailable that evening, it was clear to me that mismanagement was a deep-seeded issue. The supervisor on duty also mentioned that employees called in sick, reducing their staffing. I know that the holidays are a busy time for everyone, but I think they could have anticipated for it. It showed in their lack of cleanliness and organization. I was appalled by the sight of dirty dishes left on tables and the messiness of the food serving areas. I think based on this alone, I was being generous when I gave them 2 stars. \n\nAs far as the food goes, I couldn't even take more than 2 bites out of mine. I originally requested for the \"original\" poke bowl with ahi tuna, rice and seaweed. Unsurprisingly, they ran out of that, so I went for the spicy option. **HOT TIP** I would recommend sampling something first if you're unsure of the dish. I did just that and realized it wasn't that spicy so I decided to order the spicy poke bowl. I disliked it for several reasons: the rice was soggy, the coconut chips didn't complement the dish well imo, and the fish didn't taste fresh (how could it be when it was sitting out in the open all day behind a glass shield?). Never again will I order this dish. I could get fresher poke and better-tasting add-ons at a nearby poke joint for the price of this one ($11.50) or cheaper. My boyfriend first wanted the mango chicken bowl, which they didn't have. Then, he asked for 2 more meat entrees, which they ran out of as well. That's when he was left to order the truffle mac&cheese, which I'm glad he did because that was what I ended up eating in the end. I think the other redeeming quality of this meal was the blood orange lemonade-- not too sweet or sour. It was a pretty good balance. \n\nI guess I had high expectations after visiting the Palo Alto location, but they were hardly met at this one. As you can see, there was much left to be desired.", "author": "Brittany D."}

Truffle Mac & Cheese was delicious and creamy ! Good amount of truffle flavor and cheesiness! Definitely one of my favorites here! The ahi tuna avocado poke was okay, lacked flavor. Portion was very small for $7. Would rather get a poke bowl somewhere else. The roasted turkey BLT was good. Always down for some bacon! The sandwich had decent amount of meat. It can take them up to 15 minutes to make. \n\nThe service is fairly quick. Great place for lunch ! Kinda pricey for their portions. Can easily spend $15+ per person. Not much seating available indoors. They do have seating outdoors with heating lamps. You can also get it to go and eat it on the benches nearby. \n\nNext time I'm here I'll try their blood orange lemonade.", "author": "Karen L."}

In terms of what seems like they just tossed with no flavor (aka dont get this) - mushrooms and tomato salad. You can just get these a la carte (about 3 dollars a side) or do a combo with an entree. \n\nOption Two: Main Courses - Choose between a sandwich or a protein - both priced around $7-9, but sandwich is more bang for your buck. Chicken Sandwich is a safe choice, but the tuna and poke are also really deelish but small portions. They don't serve any red meat proteins unfortunately. Butt...\n\nOption Three: Hot Dishes - Mac and Cheeses, Mashed Potatoes, and their flavorful beef stew and much more. I would suggest getting some mashies - their mac and cheese is kind of a hit or miss - even the truffle. \n\nOption Four: Desserts and Lemonade. Their macaroons aren't cheap, but they hit the Sweet spot-pistachio macaroon is very tasty if you like pistachios. In terms of lemonade, the water melon and blood orange are my faves. For 3 dollars, its actually really good. You cant mess up on Lemonade especially when that's name of your restaurant and now a Beyonce Album. They don't always have the same flavors, but it's always good to mix and match some! \n\nI love when chain restaurants move to SF like Fogo de Chao, Tender Greens, to name a few, but the Lemonade here just seems like an after thought compared to LA.

It is for someone with adventurous taste, but also caters to those who want it a little close to home.\n\nBut here are the problems. Pricing aside (it can get hefty if you want to try a few things), they have no idea how to crowd control. People who only want salads will be blocked by others waiting on the cold and hot foods - even though they are supposed to be separate lines. There aren't anything indicating how you should line up. Further more, there are so many choices that people take forever deciding at the counter, after spending forever lining up. Each server has to ring up your items separately so that takes another forever.\n\nWhy not have menus up front, or giant TVs or chalkboards up top where people can see? Or a system where people pay a set price for the number of items they get and some extras for specially colored premium items?

The pasta salad flavor was good, but I didn't like the pasta. It was too hard. I wish it were softer. The corn chowder was good, but a touch too sweet for me.\n\nI can taste how good and fresh everything here is and I appreciate that.

Thinking the broccoli looked lonely on the other plate, I ordered the $4.50 White Truffle Mac 'N Cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/1Nvf1Gk).\n\nJamie was far more mindful of portion control and went for the $4.50 Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Aged Cheddar accompanied by a $2.95 side of Lima Beans with Strawberries, Smoked Gouda and Red Wine Oregano Vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1OudL6j). It was like a school lunch for the well-heeled Seacliff set.

It reminds me of the prepared food counters at Whole Foods.  Everything looks so pretty, sounds fancy, is a tad pricey but tastes kinda mediocre.  For about $25 (after tax and health surcharge) I got two fish items, one side and a drink.  I don't mind dropping some cash for a nice lunch, but I feel like there are better places to spend that money in the SoMa/FiDi area.\n\nAhi Tuna Poke: Poke seems to be the hottest trending it food in San Francisco now, so there is some stiff competition.  The avocado made the poke more pasty than juicy.  It also offset the kick you get from ingredients such as garlic.  Overall, it tasted a bit too mild for me.  The tuna chunks were large, however, they were a little tougher than I've had elsewhere.\n\nAvocado Salmon Louie: Very cool presentation.  Salmon mixed with all sorts of flavoring and presented in half of an avocado.  I really liked the dill; always a classic salmon pairing.  It was fun to eat, having to dig into the avocado after getting some salmon on your fork.  Probably my favorite of the items I got.\n\nTruffle Mac 'n Cheese: Biggest flaw was that the noodles were quite soggy instead of al dente, making a huge texture faux pas.  They were very heavy on the white peppercorn and pretty light on the truffle.  There was ample cheese sauce though.  Would have been nice if they had some crusty gratin\u00e9ed cheese or breadcrumbs to add a crunchy texture.\n\nGuava Limeade: I'm a huge guava fan, so had to get this one.  It was definitely stronger on the lime side than the guava side.  And more tart than sweet.  It'd probably taste amazing with some vodka; too bad that's not on the menu.", "author": "Adam B."}

It's just okay to me. \n\nI will say that for a business operating on opening day, the line kept moving quickly and the flow of things were much smoother than other places that open their doors to the public on the first day. However, it was still quite a hectic time trying to navigate through the different booths for food. From what I understand, you start off in the \"marketplace\" where you choose your vegan/vegetarian foods, and as you make your way up the line, you can get \"Land and Sea\" foods (meat and seafood), sandwiches, hot dishes (rice, mac n cheese, rotisserie meats, chili, etc), and dessert. When you arrive at the counter, that's where you can opt to get your lemonade drink(s). \n\nOn opening day, I opted for 3 dishes and one of their lemonades: \n\nSoba Noodles & Kimchi Vegetables - Soba noodles were very cold and refreshing, and had a good texture to them. There was a nice twist to the kimchi vegetables, as they were not red nor particularly spicy. I guess that's just to please the palette of the average person who has yet to be graced by the flavor of the red kimchi the Koreans are known for. Anyway, nice dish! \n\nLemongrass Chicken Slaw - I didn't like this one too much, mainly because the \"Szechuan vinaigrette\"...didn't taste like Szechuan cuisine (i.e. not spicy). It also did not have a particular \"lemongrass\" taste to it, which was disappointing. \n\nSeared Ahi Tuna - Tuna was fresh, had no smell to it, and the crushed orange ginger ponzu dipping sauce is a surprisingly nice complement to it. \n\nBlood orange lemonade - If you don't like tangy aftertastes, go for this one. However, it kind of walks the line between \"too sweet\" and \"just right\". I have a feeling the other lemonades will be the same. \n\nAnyway, it's worth a try!

The portions are also probably not the most filling so you'll be leaving the door with ~$10 less. Truffle Mac and cheese is probably the most decent thing I had (although the pasta was a little soft and it came out lukewarm)\n\nTo be fair, the line does go by pretty quick and they have a staff at the line to answer any questions.

Once it was finally my turn to check out, the poor cashier couldn't figure out how to print a receipt since we had to sign it but the receipt printer was having issues, and we had to wait for his manager to come help him figure it out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-22", "description": "3 for Food, 2 for Service\n\nI always liked the Lemonade back home, so I was excited to visit this one a few weeks ago. Lemonade is basically an upscale cafeteria with LOTS of different nicely prepared vegetables, some sandwiches, some \"sides\" (mac n cheese, stews, mashed potatoes, etc), a couple desserts, and some varieties of lemonade (watermelon, mint, original, etc). I have always really liked the sandwiches at Lemonade, particularly the Herb Grilled Chicken and the Tomato& Mozzarella. When I tried these sandwiches at these restaurant, they were like they always were: very good. At this restaurant, I also had the option to order the \"sandwich plate,\" which came with my sandwich, some kettle-cooked-type chips, and a fairly large salad. Together, these things take up a very large plate, so I was unable to finish the whole thing. The plate was about ~$12, which is a little pricey but still reasonable for how much food you get. The price of the lemonade was a little excessive ($3.50 for an unrefillable cup).\n\nWhat I didn't quite like about my experience a few weeks ago was that I ordered my plate and they were prepping my sandwich when they realized that they had none of the side salad I wanted. i wouldn't have necessarily ordered a plate if I knew that the good salad was gone, but I still got the replacement salad, the Pacific Rim salad. My parents and I all thought that this salad was kind of crappy and bland. Also, the cashier rung us up for the wrong order.\n\nSeating is pretty limited inside the restaurant, but there is also some seating outside and in the park area. It is a pretty pleasant place to sit when weather is nice.\n\nToday, I tried to visit again, and as we were walking in the restaurant, someone stopped us and told us that they were not going to be opening on-time today. Notably, it was already 10 minutes late (11:10). As we were leaving, they locked the doors behind us, indicating (to us) that they would probably be another 10-15 minutes late.

You start at the The Marketplace, where they serve all types of seasonal salad entrees and other small plates. These small entrees are $3 per portion.  I LOVE the watermelon radish because I can't get that anywhere else. You can then move to the Land & Sea or Hot Dishes section after the Marketplace. I usually opt out of the Hot Dishes. My go to is always the Tuna Poke because I feel like I get the best deal for my money. The Seared Ahi Tuna is also really good but I'm not sure if 4 or 5 slices is worth the $7. \n\nAnd before you leave the place, remember to get a cup of Lemonade! My favorite part about this place is actually their lemonades ( the best one is the Blood Orange!). As you can see, it's easy to rack up a large bill here if you get 2 items at the Marketplace, 1 item at the Land & Sea and a Lemonade. The quality of the food is pretty good and healthy but I always feel like I can get a more filling meal somewhere else. Another reason why Lemonade lost a star is how messy the lines can be sometimes. Everyone doesn't know where to go and is all over the place (maybe it's a little bit better now). Also, the Marketplace allows people to sample the dishes so it takes FOREVER AND A DAY sometimes. Like people, come on, move it ......\n\nTIP: If you want a sandwich, you can skip the line to the Marketplace and go straight to the sandwich section! \n\nOverall, it's a good lunch spot to hang out as there's a huge patio (but almost impossible to find a space to sit) but maybe not an everyday place.

Everything was a little salty to me and everything tasted super healthy, which isn't what I'm really used to. I also tried the cucumber mint lemonade and the seasonal watermelon lemonade as well, both were pretty good! I also tried the pistachio macaron, it was huge! The biggest macaron I've ever tasted. It was pretty good, a little on the sweeter side but I really liked it's chewy texture. I will probably come back and try other things on the menu and try the other flavors of lemonade as well.

I came for a second try thinking maybe my first attempt was just a bad day in their kitchen. Got my kid a mac and cheese which tasted like they made it from scratch. He ate about half a cup. Poke bowl looked pretty good in the picture, and the poke in the food display looked pretty fresh so I ordered myself the spicy poke bowl. Presentation: four star, price for amount of poke you get: two star, taste: one star. The basic ingredient that compliments the poke is  nice fluffy rice. How can you mess something this simple? The rice was hard, under cooked and chewy as if I was eating brown rice. At first I thought it was the crunchy garlic, but ate a few of the rice grains and confirmed undercooked rice. The poke isn't bad, but lacks flavor and a spicy kick. With bad rice, it's hard to enjoy everything else. There's a reason Japanese master the art of rice.  The blood orange lemonade was great at first, but got watered down so fast that it was as if I was drinking flavored water. Sadly I don't think I will be back again.", "author": "Janice W."}

I honestly made it a point to stop by Lemonade and pick up a drink whenever I was in SoCal. Now that there a few locations here in the Bay Area, I am ecstatic.\n\nMy absolute favorite lemonade has been their Cucumber Mint Limeade.  Extremely refreshing, light, and not too sweet like their other flavors. The Blueberry Mint Lemonade is also worth mentioning too. The subtle mint flavor really compliments the blueberry. I have also tried their Guava limeade and to be  honest, I'm not much of a fan simply because it's way too sour.\n\nAs for food, there are so many options! Usually I always settle for their popular combination of 2 Marketplace items and a Land Sea entree. My personal favorites have been the Pineapple Chicken and New Mexican Roasted Butternut Squash. The Pineapple Chicken is reminiscent of a healthier version Kung Pao Chicken dish which has the tangy flavor from their dressing yet sweet from the pineapple. The toasted coconut also gives it the perfect crunch. The New Mexican Roasted Butternut is my favorite mainly because it's good and second because I love corn.\n\nAs for Land and Sea, you can never go wrong with their Avocado Salmon Louie or Roasted Chicken. Both are hearty enough to keep you full for at least a couple hours.\n\nWhen you get the chance, you need to also try their Hot Dishes. Their braises are so juicy and tender. The rotisserie chicken is delicious as well and full of flavor. Oh and their white truffle Mac 'N Cheese is to die for!

One of my favorite protein entrees is the salmon salad served in the halved avocado.

There were so many, and I wanted to try them all! There was old fashioned lemonade, pomegranate tarragon, coconut apple & kaffir lime, cucumber mint, blood orange, and watermelon rosemary. Even though they're really nice about giving you samples when you ask for them, I felt bad asking for more than three, so I limited my samples to the pomegranate tarragon, blood orange, and watermelon rosemary lemonades.  The tarragon in the pomegranate tarragon was a little too weird for me, but the blood orange and watermelon rosemary were both delicious!

The concept seems a little overwhelming at first, and there was no brief explanation or pricing at the front.

I ended up getting two \"marketplace\" items, being cold meatless salad like options.  Tough choice but I went with the asparagus and cherry tomato salad, couscous with mushroom, and the poke.  Portions aren't like 10 course Michelin rated small, but they are a little on the smaller side for the area.  The poke seemed like a bit more even priced for the quantity.  Total cost after tax was $14.  Some of the asparagus was hard, so they definitely weren't cooked long enough.  The mushroom couscous was lightly seasoned and enjoyable.  On first glance of the poke, it didn't look seasoned at all since I just would clearly see the pink fish flesh, but it had some sesame oil and what made it so spicy were the slices of jalape\u00f1o.  I would have liked a bit more of a sauce/marinade for the poke.  No other issues with the preparation or freshness of the fish.  It was around 6:15 or so on a Wednesday and lots of their seating was taken up so I plopped down on one of the last indoor booths which was meant for a minimum of 2, but could easily fit 4-6.  \n\nI'd give Lemonade a chance, but definitely be more mindful of what I'd order.

Don't get me wrong, I totally dig Lemonade's healthy fast casual concept. I like the variety of salads, small plates, sandwiches, and protein items. And I like that everything is in the $10-$12 price range. But something just feels off.\n\nI guess it all starts with the ordering process. The restaurant has a cafeteria-style set-up. They give you a tray; you choose the items you want; they give you a number; and then you pay. Sounds pretty simple, right? And yet it wasn't. Upon entry, we were handed a menu (which sort of contradicts the idea of a pick & choose cafeteria set-up). And even more bizarre, the menu doesn't really tell you anything other than the combo/pricing options. For example, you can order a Land & Sea combo, or a Sandwich & Salad combo. Or, you can go straight to the hot bar (and completely bypass everyone in the other lines). Everyone in line just looked perplexed by the whole ordering system. One person opted to go straight to the sandwich counter, and someone accused her of cutting the line. They definitely need a better traffic-control system.\n\nBy the time I finally arrived at the food counter, I was just overwhelmed by all the food options. I wound up ordering a combo deal (poached salmon with 2 sides) for $12.95. The sides I got were the sobu noodles/veggies with peanut sauce, and the ahi tuna/veggie medley. The salmon was quite good and a generous portion. The sobu noodles were a nice starch to pair with my protein. However, the ahi tuna/veggie medley was quite bland.\n\nWhile waiting in line, I happened to pass by the hot bar. The nice chef working the counter offered me a taste of their braised short rib. Wow - that dish packed quite a flavorful punch. I think next time I might forego all the healthy stuff and beeline straight to the hot bar for some unhealthy meat, mac & cheese, and other carby-goodness.\n\nOn the plus side, all the employees were super friendly and accommodating even while they were getting bum-rushed. Also, there's plenty of sunny outdoor seating. And for the most part, the food is quite tasty and fresh. But waiting in line for food here is a bit complicated.

Since I am a big fan of orange juice though, I was more than happy to try the blood orange lemonade they serve here. The service was very quick and the venue was surprisingly pretty packed with a lot of people eating. I enjoyed my drink but I do wish they had a smaller size as well as the standard size, since I found it really hard to finish my entire drink by myself. The location here is also very nicely located in Yerba Buena gardens, so it is a very convenient place to visit whether you're on an afternoon stroll or tired from the mall.", "author": "Catherine S."}

I still think the layout (especially in small space at YB) is quite confusing and chaotic at times. Many customers unknowingly cut lines for specific items, and it can take quite long to pay for your meal.\n\nThe \"Marketplace\" dishes are better here than they are at many of the LA locations! They are definitely expensive, but all of the veggies are fresh and delicious. My current favorites include the Kumquat Kale Salad and the Panzanella Salad, and the Roasted Carrots. Salads are always tasty too, and dressing can mixed in or served on the side. \n\nBy far my favorite cold meat dish is the Curry Chicken!! It is quite rich, but the sliced apple, golden raisins, and mayo/curry sauce on the chicken work quite well together!\n\nLemonade beverages are tasty, but nothing special in my book.

I came during lunch time on Thursday and it was busy but we were still able to quickly get our food. \n\nThe salads were delicious! Grabbing 4 of their small salads at $2.95 each you can have a variety of flavors and choices and they all were very fresh and tasted great. We had the New Mexican Roasted Butternut Squash, Kale and Kumquat, Wild Arugula and Asian Pears and the Watermelon Radish and Ahi Tuna. They all were very well seasoned and good portion sized for its price. Only thing was the Watermelon Radish and Ahi Tuna I wish had more tuna because I had only two pieces in it and it was much less seasoned than the rest so I barely tasted it. However, they all were fresh and filling.\n\nWhile I was very tempted to try more things we said next time we come we will! The lemonades itself: we ended up getting the Blood Orange lemonade and the Guava limeade and I liked both. I can see why the Blood Orange lemonade is its best seller with its sweetness without being overly sweet. The Guava limeade is tart and I love tart so for me it worked out great but if you aren't a fan watch out because it does get very acidic as you keep drinking. \n\nOverall it was great and the staff were nice, patient, and really friendly. If you are eating there, it is kind of a feat to find seating while the staff are quick to clean up and get rid of peoples plates, so many people come that you need to just hope that people leave as quickly as people are being seated.", "author": "Angela S."}

They have seasonal salads, land/sea, sandwiches, and hot foods. You can get a combo of 2 salads + 1 land/sea for $12.95, a combo of sandwich + 1 side salad for $11.95, or 1 full salad + land/sea for $14.75. Every time I dined there, I was full with 2 or 3 signature salads, for $2.95 each. Definitely not making my wallet cry!\n\n- Roasted Cauliflower with golden raisins, almonds, and curry vinaigrette: these are vegetables I can eat forever! The curry was flavorful and not overpowering.\n- Israeli Couscous with mushroom, parmesan, and lemon truffle vinaigrette: the couscous was cooked perfectly and filling\n- Soba Noodles & Kimchi Vegetables with peanuts and creamy sesame vinaigrette: light and filling\n- Orecchiette Pasta & Cherry Tomatoes with mozzarella and chimichurri vinaigrette: big portions (filling because of the pasta) and very juicy cherry tomatoes\n- Watermelon Radish & Seared Ahi Tuna with snap peas, ginger, and sesame vinaigrette: this dish was just okay to me - not too much ahi tuna (although big pieces), but lots of snap peas so it was definitely healthy tasting\n- Smoked Salmon with watercress, bagel chips, and horseradish dressing: surprisingly, there was a lot of smoked salmon in this dish. Love!\n- White Truffle Mac N Cheese ($4.50): apparently, this is the most popular hot dish! It was definitely good, but I didn't think it was the best truffle mac n cheese I've ever had.\n\nA cup of lemonade is $3.50, and they have a couple of flavors for you to choose from.

I'm so tempted to buy their next cookbook so I could just make it myself. I think price point is pretty good, and you can just request a different number of portions depending how hungry you are.

Lemonade was never really my go-to chain in socal, but it's never a bad choice if I do decide to go. \n\nHow it all works is you make your way down the line choosing foods from sections of Marketplace, Leafy Greens, Land & Sea, Sandwiches, and Hot Dishes. At no means do you have to start at the beginning if you just want specific foods from different sections. Lemonade can be ordered at the register.\n\nSERVICE: \nMajority of the workers all exemplified great customer service. The worker who passed around menus to people coming in greeted everyone nicely and explained the menu in a concise manner. Tables were always being cleaned and cleared as soon as customers finished their meals. The people serving food on our plates were super patient and welcoming while allowing everyone to sample as much as they could (marketplace food, hot dishes, and lemonade ...not the land & sea). The cashier neglected to ask if I wanted to sample any lemonade, but it's understandable considering how hectic the line got. My friends and I weren't sure whether or not to leave the trays or dispose of our mess ourselves, so when we attempted to separate our trash in the designated bins, one of the workers politely told us he could handle everything. Overall, this is the best kind of service I've had in a very long time.\n\nFOOD:\n-Hawaiian ahi tuna poke: (3/5) I've had better. \n-soba noodles & kimchi: (4/5) A nice mixed dish but not much kimchi to it.\n-some Thai chicken/beans (can't find on menu): (4/5) Slightly spicy, but tasty.\n-mac & cheese: (4/5) Mac and cheese tasted great!

These employees are sauntering about and have ZERO sense of urgency. I don't typically write reviews based on speed because I a) understand lines and wait times and b) I'm generally a patient person.

Apparently the lines are shorter on the weekends than weekday. Makes sense due to the FiDi work crowd.\n\nStep 1 - Get in line and decide quickly! \n\nStep 2 - The menu says you are welcome to sample. They've got a bunch of veggie options. \n\nStep 3 - Pay, get your number, and stand and wait or find a table. They will bring your order to you. \n\nOriginally I wanted to order vine ripe tomatoes from the Hot Veggies section of menu, but it was unavailable so I quickly decided on cherry tomato+avocado ($2.95) from Vegan section. I also ordered the Gandolfini sandwich ($7.95), which has thin slices of turkey, chicken and ham, thin slice of swiss cheese, and lots of pepperoncini and olives. Fantastic flavors from the pepperoncini and olives. Not sure if they added any dressing but the sandwich drips all over the place; it was a bit much. Luckily the bread is sturdy. I think it was sourdough, but they don't ask what kind of bread you want. \n\nI could have done without the cherry tomato and avocado. The tomatoes were overripe and not firm and since the avocado has been sitting out, it was mushy. I will stick with the sandwiches and try the other veggies sides on a future visit. AND of course, try a lemonade.  \n\nOverall, fast and very friendly service, reasonable prices, and tasty food!", "author": "Thomas L."}

I was a little confused when I walked in, and sad because I miss La Boulange, but there was a nice man there to help me, and told me what I had to do to get food. It's like a buffet but you're charged per item, and there's a salad section, where you get charged per portion (so you could get 4 portions of the same thing or 2 different single portions). There's a helpful stack of boxes to show you how big the portions are. Then you tell the people behind the glass what you'd like and how much. TIP! You can taste anything! It's really similar to going out for ice-cream, but much healthier. Next section is sandwiches followed by hot food. Both of these are served at a steady portion size so they're priced as is, like a cup of chowder is going to be this much. And there's dessert you can grab near the cashier (also individually priced).\n\nThis place is a safe haven for vegetarians and meat eaters alike! So many vegetarian options! They're mostly labeled as such but if you're not sure, there's the person who made it just behind the glass! Also great that they don't make it feel like you're separate for eating only vegetarian dishes. \n\nThe food it very tasty! I tried the veggie chili but I wanted it spicier so I stuck to the salads at the front. Let me just say I was not expecting some of the flavor combinations, nor going home with fava beans of all things. \n\nIf anyone is complaining about the price, punch them. They're getting amazing quality food for what they're paying for, and the servers are all honest, friendly, and polite. If you're in a rush come another time, because it's much better to take your time and figure out what you really want. \n\nIf you're confused about the line, don't be. You don't have to stay at the counter waiting for the lunch line to move along, you can get in line to pay for whatever number you were assigned when you started asking for food. It's a little cramped though, so it might be difficult to distinguish the lines, but I have faith that you're all smart people and can figure that bit out.", "author": "Astrid V."}

I had done my research before, so I came in knowing what I wanted. I knew I could cut in line, so I ordered the turkey BLT sandwich with avocados, arugula, and a pesto aioli sauce. I also ordered the guava limeade. I like that you order first and pay. It's just easier when you go out with friends and don't have worry about splitting the check. I waited approximately 5-10 minutes for my sandwich to come. It was quite big to just eat it fully, so I cut it in half. I took a bite and it was delicious. The arugula was probably my favorite part. Pesto is one of my favorites, so that was just amazing. The guava limeade was a little too tart, but I still enjoyed it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-15", "description": "This LA staple has finally made it to SF! Ive heard so much about their LA location that I could not wait until they opened here. First let me say that a lot of reviews complain about the price. Well, quality comes with a price. That should be a fact everyone knows. Id like to say thats common sense, but common sense is not common. In SF, everything good has a price. If our standard of living here is amongst the highest, why did anyone think that this place would be \"cheap\". If you expect \"cheap\" salad go to Fresh Choice with absolutely no quality at all. Im just saying. \n\nThis place has excellent customer service. Amazing, fresh and delicious food. Indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has heat lamps up above that are set at the perfect temperature. You know how sometimes the heat laps elsewhere seem like its burning your head off that when you touch your head your hair is hot? This isnt the case here. Plus..what other restaurant allows you to sample their dishes AND lemonade before purchase?!?! I cant even name one restaurant that permits this. This fact alone blows me away. By sampling your food before you eat, prevents you from ordering something you dont like!! So, all these reviews about this dish being \"just ok\" or not good or whatever... Well buddy. If it wasnt good why did you order it?? You couldve sampled it first. And if you didnt sample and took a chance well you dont know how to use your resources correctly so that is on you. \n\nI highly recommend this place for amazing quality and fresh food. They provide very unique dishes that would take so much time if you tried to replicate yourself. This aint just a grilled chicken cesar salad kind of place. Can you make \"Watermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas and ginger and sesame vinaigrette\"??? Actually Im sure someone can but how long would that take you. Convenience is key in such a busy city. Emphasizing again, quality is great! \n\nThe cucumber mint lemonade is very refreshing. The blood orange lemonade is to die for if you love blood orange. We ordered a lot of food and spent $50 for 2 people.\n\nFrom the Marketplace section:\nWatermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas\nArugula and asian pears\nBLT panzanella\nSmoked salmon\n\nFrom Land & Sea:\nShrimp\nSeared ahi tuna (with orange ginger ponzu on top or on the side)\nTheir special of the day was a curry apple and chicken\n\nFrom the Hot Section:\nBbq brisket\n\nFrom Desserts:\nMacaron- Salted Caramel -- which was huuge. The biggest macaron Ive ever had. It didnt taste like your typical salted caramel though. It wasnt oozing with caramel. To me it tasted more along the lines of a snickerdoodle for some reason. But I still enjoyed it. It wasnt too sweet. There was a lot of filling so you cant cut it with a knife or bite into it like a sandwich because all the filling will come out of the sides. The best way to eat it is with a fork. You are able to control the oozing much better. The macaron is chewy yet soft and very flavorful. \n\nLemonades:\nBlood orange\nCucumber Mint\n\nEvery dish was excellent. We sampled everything we ordered so Im not going into detail on how well each dish tasted. They were all good. The macaron was not typical so that info I had to share.\n\nThis place is worth a try. I promise you wont regret it. The lemonade alone will bring me back every time. I'll be back again for sure. They didnt have Poke when I went so I cant wait to come back and try it!", "author": "Sarina A."}

There are sections of marketplace, leafy greens, land and sea, sandwiches, and hot dishes. You are encouraged to mix and match between the categories to make your meal. There are so many options in each of the categories that it can be overwhelming to make a decision, something that I don't like. There are about 30 options to choose from. Add that with the lunch crowd, confusing layout, and there is a large amount of confused people in a little area. The choices displayed looked good and I chose a buttermilk baked chicken sandwich with a side of truffle mac and cheese. To drink I opted for the carrot ginger juice and my meal was about $18. The sandwich was ok. The bread was thick and dry, but the chicken was tasty. The truffle mac had good flavor, but the noodles were overcooked and mushy. All in all the meal was ok and definitely not worth the cost. \n\nBut the staff are very friendly and accommodating to new diners. They help walk you through the process and will answer your questions. You are also encouraged to sample the dishes as you move along, which is nice to help decide what you order.

Would have given 5 stars if it had been more veg-friendly. \n\nFull disclosure: I came here for a free lunch before it opened because a co-worker's wife is affiliated with the restaurant. But they rang us up as if we were paying, and the core part of my lunch (2 marketplace items plus 1 \"hot\" item) would have been $10.40 -- very reasonable for lunch downtown. Lemonade offers a huge array of fresh, relatively healthy items, all of which were delicious. I particularly liked the New Mexican-style squash that included corn nuts for crunch. The truffle mac'n cheese, although obviously less healthy, was also a standout. Service was fast and friendly. \n\nThe atmosphere is clean and pleasant. There seemed to be ample seating, and on a nice day, you could take your food and sit on the grass at Yerba Buena Gardens. They also have outdoor seating with heaters, a plus in Fog City!\n\nI only subtracted one star because a number of hot dishes had unnecessary meat in them that could not be removed, and the only protein toppings available for the salads are meat. My favorite lunch is a nice, hearty salad with some protein on top to keep me going, so it was disappointing that they couldn't even offer some quinoa, baked tofu cubes or tempeh.  That being said, there were plenty of vegetarian options among the \"marketplace\" items, and I definitely did not go hungry. If they bring in some salad toppings, they'll bump it up to 5 stars.\n\nLemonade's gimmick is multiple different seasonal lemonades to drink, and they all looked delicious. I had the coconut apple. They also served desserts, and my group tried 4 different ones, none of which were that special -- but who gets dessert at lunch? I didn't factor that into my review. The lemonades were enough sugar for me!\n\nOverall, this will be a great place to meet friends for lunch during the week, and I look forward to trying it again soon.", "author": "Gaelen X."}

I also congratulate myself for not eating something greasy and unhealthy, especially with Super Duper right next door.\n\nAll the food looks vibrant and fresh.  Most of the ones I've tried have been appetizing and flavorful.  My favorites are the dishes with fruit in them because I like how the sweet fruit complements the primarily savory dishes.  Examples: Ahi Tuna Avocado Poke with Mandarin Oranges, and Curry Cauliflower with Golden Raisins.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the dishes are very spicy and the heat overwhelms those dishes so they don't taste flavorful either.  Furthermore, those spicy dishes are not labeled as such!

I was really excited to take full advantage of the samples, and try new, fresh foods. However, it was completely packed when I walked in, making it very difficult to ask for samples, as they were busy and it seemed rude to hold up the line, so I had just one sample. I'm glad I got it, because I ended up not getting the Catavelli Pasta. It didn't seem like anything special, just your everyday pasta salad with olives and tomatoes. \n\nOf course after spending so much time researching, I had to get the Watermelon Radish and Grilled Tuna. I was sadly underwhelmed. It was quite salty, probably due to the seasonings they used for the tuna, but the tuna was wonderful quality, and I got quite a lot. The snap peas added a nice crunch to the dish, but were also sometimes bitter, which made the dish both salty and bitter (like me after I spent $3 on it). I also definitely got more of this than the other marketplace item I ordered, because it was in a very small to-go box.\n\nOn a whim I also got the BLT Panzanella, which I'm pretty sure I pronounced wrong when asking for it. I loved everything about it in my first bite. The turkey is moist, the avocado was fresh, the tomatoes were sweet, and the bread pieces soaked up the vinaigrette, which added a perfect tartness to the dish. And then I had a bite with the purple lettuce and a part of me died on the inside. It was more bitter than anything I've ever tasted, and I love bitter melon. It was worth it to me to pick out the five or so pieces of lettuce to enjoy the rest of the salad. I wish it came with more avocado, though, but maybe that depends on you scoop and random selection.\n\nI had planned to get the mac and cheese and was delighted to find out they do a half and half of the Traditional and the Truffle. The server accidentally packed me a full truffle one, but he happily packaged a new mixed one for me once he realized his mistake. The cup was so full he couldn't even put the lid on, which is really a bang for my 4.5 bucks! I could have had just the mac alone and been full. The traditional mac was plain, as expected. The truffle mac was very cheesy, the strings followed my fork everywhere it went. I definitely think it tasted more buttery and just made me warm and happy inside. \n\nThe lemonades were interesting. I sampled their blueberry mint, old fashioned, and watermelon rosemary, and ended up getting the former. The watermelon rosemary seemed watered down, in the way an unripe watermelon tastes. It would be a good option for those seeking a less intense lemonade. The blueberry mint tasted neither like blueberries or mint, but it was the sweetest of the three (but this does not mean it wasn't very sour). \n\nThe desserts looked very very tempting, but with my meal coming out to be almost $16, I had to say no thank you and hope I could come back next time. Overall, the meal was good, but not so much so that I don't feel sad about how much it cost. I'm happy they use eco-friendly packaging, and their environment is really nice, so I may return, just for the truffle mac and cheese and one of their desserts.", "author": "Linh-Chi T."}

I had heard plenty of good things about this LA based chain, but I gotta say, I was pretty disappointed. Let's start at the beginning. The line was sooooo long, but moved pretty quickly. Once my friend and I were in the door, someone working at Lemonade handed us a menu. We were both pretty surprised to see how many options they had. There were quite a few sections: the marketplace (small salads and sides), greens (entree sized salads), land and sea (different protein items), hot dishes, desserts, and of course lemonade! The menu also featured a nice little combo deal! It offered two items from the marketplace and one item from the land and sea section for only $12.75. This seemed like the best option for me. Another nice thing is that you can taste anything you want! Just gotta ask! This is probably why the line is so long! The Hawaiian poke was pretty good. After my friend and I got all of our food, we were told we could skip the other sections and go straight to pay. It felt weird to \"cut\" the line but no one else seemed to notice. We each got a lemonade. There were so many choices! After tasting a few, I chose the cucumber mint lemonade and it was delicious! It was a generous serving of probably 24 oz? 32 oz? I'm not sure but it was a large cup and for only $3.50. When I went up to pay, the cashier informed me that they were no longer doing that \"promotion\"... I was pretty surprised to hear that since they are still using menus that highlight those deals... Thankfully it only would have saved me about $0.20 but still! I don't understand why they don't just honor their own deal! It's even listed on their website... I know the restaurant is pretty new to the area but it isn't a new company. Get it together! \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good, just really small portions. I wish I had opted for something more filling, like a sandwich or a large salad.

It has the perfect amount of sweetness and no need to add any additional sugar. My friend ordered the guava and it was good too! It was sweet but perfect. I could drink lemonade all day if I could. We ordered a caesar salad with extra crotons along with vinaigrette- super delicious! I ordered a roasted chicken sandwich and I loved it! I would definitely order it again. My friend ordered a crusted chicken sandwich and thought it was kinda dry. Overall, a good experience here and will definitely come back.

This site isn't reflective of the Lemonades I've visited. In all fairness, the employees were polite and attentive. Customer service was not the problem. The three salads in the big bowls between the marketplace salads and the hot items looked like they needed to be freshened up. I was sad to not see Blue Lake Green Beans or ANYTHING similar. I love the red peppers in that dish. The tables were dirty, the bussing station was full. There didn't seem to a shortage of employees; it just seems like they didn't get trained in Southern California. The arugula salad was a bit wiltier than I've had at any other Lemonade location. The truffle mac and cheese was great as usual. Maybe it's just a cleanliness issue. We can't chalk it up to customer volume though because I've been in longer lines at busier Lemonad locations and they were still clean and picked up.

So when they finally came up to the SF Area, I was totally excited. This location is much smaller than what I'm used too. There's only about 4 booths to sit inside, and everything is outside. They have heating lamps but during the windy/rainy season, I don't think it's going to be very pleasant. It is a great take-out alternative though, but it can get pricey if you're eye hungry. \n\nWhat's the big deal? Well for those who have allergies like myself, every dish is practically labeled whether it's gluten free, contains dairy or eggs or seafood etc.... \n\nSo if i'm a fan, why did I give it 3 stars vs. 5 stars. As I was going down the cafeteria style like point and order, I noticed that the server didn't have a separate ladle for their stew dish and used another ladle from another dish. What's the big deal? Cross contamination of food ingredients. Again for someone who has allergies or strict eating habits, this is not acceptable. \n\nI had questioned the employee of what she had just done, and she stated they do that with all the stew/meat dishes? This didn't make sense to me. So I had to stop the line dead in it's tracks, asking what the ingredients were in the dishes she was sharing the ladle in. She was very polite, pulled out her menu book with the ingredients listed. She brought out a new pot of the braised beef and a new separate ladle for it. Was the pot really new? Who knows? All I know, I didn't have an allergic reaction. I appreciated her honesty and customer service. \n\nI hope management changes their policy on how they handle their dishes in the future.", "author": "Carolyn S."}

So to make a long story short, do not jump the line even if they say you should. \n\nThe food overall looked very good and healthy, I did enjoy my dishes and it was reasonably priced.

There were generous chunks of tuna, but the tuna was a bit dry.\n\nMy husband decided to try one of the promotions: a special tossed salad which the poster listed at $5.50 and, with an addition from \"Land or Sea,\" the poster listed $6.95. Our interpretation was the \"Land and Sea\" addition would be an additional $1.45.\n\nWe learned at the cashier that our interpretation was wrong. The special tossed salad was $5.50 and the \"Land and Sea\" addition was $6.95, totaling $12.45 for the two items.\n\nThe tossed salad was rather ordinary, making me wonder why it was promoted as \"special.\" The \"Land or Sea\" addition hubby chose was a chicken salad, which was just okay.

I ordered a grilled chicken breast panino and my husband the salad with ahi tuna. The people who served us were positive, nice and happy to help us decide on our dinner.

Finally we asked to try one lemonade each. The cashier gave it with an attitude then helped the others in line. The woman asked to try one and he was happy to give it to her. We decided what we wanted and watched at least three employees pass our register. Not one offering or asking if we had been helped.

The sandwich was supposed to have pesto but it was a mayo aioli and I can't stomach mayo. If that wasn't enough I thought well the side salad should help but it wasn't a basic side salad. I got up charged for a Caesar salad that was drenched in Caesar dressing which also grosses me out. I just wanted a simple chicken and pesto sandwich with a side of greens and raw veggies. This whole experience was just magnified by the fact that I wasn't feeling well and didn't have the energy to go out and get my own dinner. All of this could have been prevented if the menu was accurate and detailed on Postmates. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken for what it is.

You start at the end of the line with what can be best described as cold side dishes (think veggies, pasta salads, etc.), then some cold proteins (fish, chicken, etc.), then sandwiches, and then hot entrees/dishes (chili, mac & cheese, roasted meats, etc.). In my opinion, the order of the line should be completely flipped around where you start with the hot entrees first. I choose my sides based on my entree, not the other way around. Everyone was just kind of confused as to how the process worked. The food itself was meh. I got a piece of cold salmon, and a side of some type of carrot salad. These two items plus a lemonade brought me to around $17. The food was lackluster, the organization of the restaurant was confusing, and the price point was too high for what I got.

Her words were, \"there's so many choices and it can be overwhelming at first.\" People in line wanted to try everything before getting it. You go through the line from the salad bar, seafood area, sandwiches, soups, drinks, and cash register where you pay. There was limited seating but you could get your food and eat it near the place. We got the quinoa, snap peas, tuna stuffed avocado, the turkey sandwich, and guava lemonade. The food was okay, not spectacular. My favorite would be the sandwich cause it was warm and flavorful. Also the lemonade was a must have! Least favorite would be the tuna stuffed avocado. There was a bitter tasting thing that was on top of it (looked like cucumber and a piece of poke/ radish) that threw off my taste buds completely.

If you have not been here before, be prepared. This place is very overwhelming if you have not been here before and are not prepared. The set up reminds me of a cafeteria. You take a tray, you walk in one line past food behind a glass partition and you decide what you want to put on your tray. The only problem is, there is no list of the food offered for that day posted anywhere. Therefore when you walk in, you just start blindly walking, randomly picking food that you like as you pass it because you have no idea what is going to be in front of you. I picked an assortment of macaroni and cheese and a pannini. As per their name, they do have a variety of lemonades for you to choose from, although, they are not your normal combinations or varieties of lemonade. The lemonade I ended up purchasing was watermelon and rosemary. The worker there told me that the rosemary was very subtle and he could not have been more wrong. The rosemary left a weird after taste in my mouth and I am sure not to get that again. The pannini and the mac and cheese were okay, nothing special or outstanding about them and they both were lukewarm. An interesting take on a dining experience but not something I am looking to try again.", "author": "Lex D."}

To my surprise the food was really delish! You get samples of whatever you like to try. They have an assortment of different lemonades. My favorite being the coconut lemonade! I also love the tuna cold salad. There is a girl there by the name of \"NICOLE\". If it weren't for her I would not know that the truffle and red sauce Mac and cheese went well together. She was so pleasant and helped me out with recommendations. She always has a smile on her face and ready to help. It's because of her that I tip at the register. I came in one day and my meat was not cooked all the way and she made sure I was happy when I left. That's great customer service and she could teach some of the others what great customer service is? Because of her is why I return. It's expensive being downtown S.F but well worth the coins!

Because of a convention, heavy tourism, Bay to Breakers and nice sunny weather, it was busy.  The line was to the door, but it did go fairly fast.\n\nI found the ordering system to be a tad all over the place.  People ordering from 3 different areas and jumping in front of each other.  I didn't know where I was supposed to stand.\n\nThe menu was pretty extensive.  A number of cold salad dishes, sandwiches and several hot items.  I wanted the Mac & Cheese but was told that it had run out.  Ended up getting the Red Pepper Flake Cauliflower.  It was a nice hit of heat and pretty tasty.  If you aren't into spicy, I'd recommend steering clear of it though.  8oz portion for $4.50.\nI also got the Watermelon and Seared Ah\u00ed Tuna salad.  This was also pretty delicious but be warned; lots of little sesame seeds in it.  Bring a toothpick.\nA portion is $2.95 with lots of tuna chunks.  A great value for the price.\n\nLastly, I asked to sample the Blueberry Mint Lemonade.  That is, after all, the name of the place: Lemonade.  So, I had high hopes for a not too sweet and nicely tart drink.  They delivered.  The mint and blueberry work great together.  I'll have to try the other flavors next time.\n\nOverall, worth another visit.

The proteins should be the 1st thing, not cold sides. Doesn't make sense. It's all chaos from there. Instead of one person expediting me through the line, I kept getting passed from one person to the next. Because apparently, the cold side person could not possibly be good enough for hot sides. While he checks his texts, with no customers. But I digress. It's just a long, drawn out process for what amounts to 'ok' food (it's not bad, not mind blowing either), served in small, over priced portions. Last night I paid $4.50 for mashed potatoes which probably contained .50 cents worth of potato. And a dessert of strawberry s'mores served in a small jar, which made it look bigger than the few bites that it was.

Which was surprising to see, as we thought it was only in Los Angeles. When we arrived, it was just as it's always been. Bright, clean & welcoming. We were greeted by a lovely young lady who we right away explained, my husband had an gluten intolerance. She was so lovely about it. Showed us some items he could potentially enjoy.  She walked us through the entire line, I have to say, I really really liked the poke, very fresh. She then checked us out on a handheld computer thing, which was really nice. I haven't seen that at a lemonade before. Which probably helps when it's busy. When we finally sat down to enjoy our meal, she came over & checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. My husband asked if there was a manager he could speak too as he wanted to give kudos to the young lady & she informed us she was the manager. We were taken aback as we didn't expect that.  We think it's so great, especially because of the casualness of the restaurant, that the manager is out there with the customer ensuring good service. Well, her name was DeAna & she was such a doll. She was knowledgeable & warm. We will definitely be back when we visit family again. Kudos to the management.", "author": "Victoria T."}

We came on a sunny Saturday afternoon around 4pm following a trip to the SFMOMA a block away. A greeter explained the concept and menu to us after we entered. If you are looking to order food to-go, you go straight to the register to order. However if you want to eat in, you get in line at the food bar and order all your food a la carte. True to the cafeteria-style concept, grab your tray and then pick the items you want. The stations include: Marketplace (hearty denser savory salads), Leafy Greens (salad...), Land and Sea (fish, chicken, beef), Sandwiches (which get delivered to your table), and Hot Dishes (pasta, bbq, and specials). At the register you can order desert and drinks (specialty lemonade).  At the time we went, the restaurant wasn't crowded at all, and we moved through the line fairly quickly. However, I could definitely imagine this place being more stressful to navigate during the lunchtime rush hour.\n\nWe tasted the pickled watermelon radish and seared ahi tuna salad, the BLT panzanella, and the roasted cauliflower, all of which were fantastic and well-seasoned. We also tried the baked buttermilk chicken sandwich, which was a little dry I thought and ended up being too much food. In the future, 2 marketplace sides and a protein or hot dish would probably be a solid lunch. \n\nAmbience-wise, this spot definitely exudes SoCal coolness. There is ample indoor and outdoor sitting. We sat on the patio since it was such a nice day.  This place is great for lunch with friends or a date after doing some shopping or sightseeing downtown. I'm really looking forward to trying out the new locations that are opening elsewhere in the city/Bay Area.", "author": "J L."}

I was disappointed in my one visit. I got the \"chicken pot pie\" which was missing anything that would make it worthy of the term \"pie\". It was basically just a chicken stew or fricasee and with a rather thin light cream sauce- not like a thickened gravy or even a bechemel. When I saw the pot of stew, I thought they were going to ladel it into a crust or at least throw a puff pastry on top, but no just into a little cup... ended up paying close to $9 for a little cup of chicken-not-pie. The next day I saw a protester out front complaining they don't use union labor, and I don't know about all that but I told him the chicken pot pie was a big disappointment. Overall I won't be going back. It's a shame too, less than a block away used to be a place called the Cravery that had a great selection of really good pot pies, but that closed down and now this place is purveying crustless unthickened pot pies... maybe meant to be a gluten-free pot pie? But overall a travesty and if they can't get that right I have no interest in finding out what creative ways they find to disappoint me with their other expensive comfort foods.", "author": "Bob M."}
