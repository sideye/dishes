Recently I saw a few reviews that complained about their price and amount but for the soulfully prepared omakase ($95-150person)and extremely comfortable service, the expense is just right. \n\nThe chefs omakase, fresh appetizers (oyster, cha wan mushi, grilled fish, and more) sashimi, decent sushi, Osuimono, and house made matcha tiramisu are all delicious and so so flavorful!   \n\nIt's not a cheap restaurant and you can't  have 10 sushi within $20 but all foods you get here are amazing. After I finish my dinner, I can tell Its carefully priced for the quality and in comparison to (the few) similar sushi restaurants in Bay Area. \n\nIf I can I'd give 6stars :)\nDefinitely recommended!", "author": "Maki J."}

The small dishes tasted fine but had better presentation than taste. Very small also. The Nigiri showed up 4 pieces at a time. The fish quality was underwhelming, and the fish to rice ratio didn't seem right (very little rice). I've had nigiri better if not just as good for a $65 Omakase at a neighborhood Sushi joint (Tenichi in lower pac heights). I left the meal hungry vs the usual stuffed feeling. It also went by very quickly.\n\nService was attentive and great, decor was also nice. Overall the meal is fine, and pretty good overall, it's just not to standards to other Omakase's you can experience in SF. If it's your first Omakase experience you'll be fine.\n\nFor $95, I would much rather go to my neighborhood joint or back to Hinata ($79/pp) which is far far better quality, and more filling (not to mention much nicer decor). Generally, if a Omakase restuarant has plenty of reservations available week or day of, take it as a warning sign.\n\nNo disrespect to the restaurant and staff either, definitely appreciate the effort but this is honestly how I feel after trying 10 different Omakase's in SF. I feel this place should at least bring the price down a bit as it's just not worth it. Perhaps just morph into a regular sushi restaurant with optional limited Omakase.", "author": "Pratul L."}

Every course in the omakase was transcendent, particularly the sushi and sashimi, which were ultra-fresh and expertly prepared by the chef and his staff. Just sitting at the chef's counter and watching them work was like being part of a sushi master class.\n\nIt wasn't surprising that Maruya earned a Michelin star soon after I first dined here. But it was certainly surprising to see that chef Sasaki left Maruya right after earning that coveted honor, which in turn was not renewed the following year.\n\nI've tried Maruya once again more recently and found the magic to be missing. While each piece of fish was perfectly decent, it simply wasn't as mindblowing as the meal with chef Sasaki was. In a city that's now awash with high-end omakase experiences left and right, the bar has suddenly been raised very high, and I'm not sure Maruya rises up to the occasion any longer.\n\nAh, well, the good times were fun while they lasted.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Like many others have commented, their blatantly mass produced bento boxes were pretty mediocre. \n\nI'm sure that dining here regularly is probably better, but it's disappointing to see that they decide to get lazy at this time of the year and skimp out on the potential quality they could execute on. \n\nTheir small dishes are actually pretty delicious and far outshine their sashimi. The pumpkin bisque was very good, I enjoyed the pickles, and the clear fish broth at the very end. The steamed egg was just okay - too solid for my liking. However, the main course was really lacking. It very much tastes like run of the mill sashimi you could find at any restaurant. Nothing too special. I had the fish without soy sauce and there pretty much was no flavor. I will say that the overall dinner was very filling though, so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.\n\nThere's plenty of other omakase places in SF to hit up, and Maruya doesn't quite make the mark.", "author": "Chelsea W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-27", "description": "Exactly what Tiffany H. said 7 months ago. Mediocre.\n\nMade reservations last night through Open Table for 8:30PM to try it out for Restaurant Week. In short, don't do Restaurant Week with them. Disappointing and mediocre.\n\nPros:\n+ Small dishes were the best\n+ Service was friendly\n+ Reservations available through Open Table.\n\nCons:\n- Timing was awful\n- Fish was so mediocre\n- Service was slow\n- Food lacked flair and flavor\n\nFirstly, it was probably a mistake to do Restaurant Week. They were busy making and prepping all these bento boxes the whole night. Timing was atrocious. Absolutely atrocious. We arrived at 8:20PM for our 8:30 reservations. It took 15 minutes before a server approached us for drinks, then another 10 minutes before we got our drinks. Now add another 20 minutes before our first course came out. Pretty much an hour before we really started getting nibbles. I really suggest adopting two seating sessions like KUSAKABE. I would imagine everyone dining at the same time makes it easier on the guests and the chef.\n\nSecondly, the sashimi slices were mediocre at best. Lacked flavor. Even on its own, the slices weren't yummy. When the purist in me caves and opts to dip my fish in the soy sauce ever so slightly, it's a problem. The sushi rice on the left side of the bento was good at first, but after eating 25% of it, you realize the sushi rice has too much vinegar in it. The mushrooms are much too marinated in sauce so it becomes overly sweet after two bites.\n\nOn a brighter note, their smaller dishes, like the steamed egg, pumpkin soup, and clear fish soup were good. The hotate/scallop and unagi were also not bad.\n\nMaybe if I opted for omakase nigiri, I'd have a different review. But after this meal, I'm not inclined to return at all. The food, environment, and execution were nothing close to that of KUSAKABE.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not a sushi snob. Did Japan, but that doesn't mean I'm a fish expert or anything. My tastebuds just know this place is NOT it.", "author": "Fanny W."}

I was so upset walking out, after having paid this much for mediocre to bad food - AND, I wound up walking to Valencia and grabbing a slice of pizza because I was still starving.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have eaten at a number of the pricier omakase spots around San Francisco - so I don't have an issue with $95/person menus, generally.  However, the food we received as part of the Otsukuri Omakase menu (i.e. the sashimi omakase) was so lackluster, and in one case nauseating, that the price here cannot be justified.\n\nThe set menu starts with a soup, then a strange omelet dish, then a sort of appetizer course, then two plates of sashimi, then a soup, and finally a palette cleansing beverage.  \n\nThe first soup - a small serving of a pumpkin soup - was enjoyable, if not a bit small (and served with a baby spoon that was quite hard to eat with).  The omelet actually turned my stomach.  It was topped with the kind of shrimp you'd receive in a Sea Monkey kit.  They looked like silver fish - those gross bugs that crawl out of boxes in attics.  I had to put the lid back on the bowl, the look of it made me feel so ill.  The appetizer course, served in an elaborate box, was a let down.  Two bland scallops, one piece of overcooked fish with an overly sweet sauce, and two lukewarm pieces of fried fish / fish cake.  \n\nThe two courses of sashimi were average to bad.  It was literally just the most basic of fish, cut up and put on a plate.  They seemingly spent all of their energy on decorative vegetable displays and none on the fish.  The fish was bland, there was zero creativity, and the cuts were extremely boring - your run of the mill salmon, tuna, more scallops, etc.  I think I've purchased similar fish in pre-made boxes at my office cafeteria...  I mean, when the restaurant has to give you soy sauce and \"wasabi\" for flavor, you know something is wrong.  Most omakase spots around here don't even offer that, as the preparation of the fish doesn't necessitate it...  There was also one fish on my first plate of sashimi that seemed to be partially frozen.\n\nI thought perhaps we just messed up by getting sashimi and not nigiri...that maybe the nigiri would have been more inventive...but the table next to us ordered the nigiri omakase menu and their plates looked just as boring.  Those folks actually cut their meal short and left after receiving their second plate of nigiri.\n\nThe final soup was very fishy and included an extremely dried out piece of fish.  The highlight of the meal, frankly, was the yuzu lemonade they gave us at the end to cleanse our palettes.\n\nOh, and hot tea was $10....\n\nI will not be returning.", "author": "Tay H."}

Granted, we made the mistake of coming here during SF Restaurant Week and the kitchen must've been making those prix fixe meals en masse, which isn't how raw fish is meant to be prepared and enjoyed. The sushi and sashimi that came with our order was truly mediocre. Too much wasabi for one thing. Fish also tasted limp. \n\nThe non-raw fish items, on the other hand, were far more impressive. I really liked the \"cold\" open to the meal--the seaweed jelly was delicious, as was the scrumptious kabocha bisque, and miso glazed black cod. This was followed with a umami-filled clear broth soup with red snapper. Dessert was a burdock root creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I love love love creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the texture was mousse-y but thick and creamy, just the way I like it, but the savory flavor threw me off and I couldn't stomach more than two bites. I like my desserts to taste sweet. My husband, however, loved it!\n\nI did order from their regular menu too as I knew RW wouldn't be showcasing Maruya at their best. Aji was in season and is a perennial favorite of mine so I went with that and I also wanted to try the kinmedai as that is a Kusakabe specialty. The aji was quite good but not spectacular. The kinmedai was more disappointing: the fish was too soft and the seasoning they added overpowered the fish's intrinsic flavor.\n\nAfterwards, we drove down to El Farolito and killed an order of the super nachos l. It was WAY more satisfying and a fraction of the cost. So that was the lesson I learned that night: if you're going to go to the Mission it better be for one thing only--and that's NOT Japanese food.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

My cousin and I were fully prepared for the worst dinner of our lives after reading the slew of one star reviews Maruya just screwed themselves with. We came perfectly liquored up thanks to Bond Bar across the street and had our expectations very low. \n\nService was really good. They were very attentive and I think the entire staff is actually Japanese. They took their time explaining each course and was very nice.  They actually didn't even have their regular Omakase menu available. It was either their $150/menu or the $65/deal. We would have canceled if there wasn't a $30/pp cancellation fee.\n\nThe appetizer set of three items was good. My fish was salty and I hated the seaweed jelly but finished everything. Everything was presented super cute. Oh and they gave us warm hand wipes as soon as we sat down. \n\nNext course was the nigiri which came in a bento. There were 6 different items as well as tamago, unagi, and the dreaded cucumber roll. My cousin was all wtf are they going to serve us inari next?! Teehee. We were super full by the end so not sure why everyone was complaining about the small portions. We were stuffed to the brim and there was still a soup and dessert course. I actually had no idea there was a soup course and it had a piece of red snapper in it. Not bad. \n\nDessert was a burdock root creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Not bad. I ate the whole thing even though I usually do not like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Tasted oddly savory. \n\nSo the service was good, we were full, and the sushi was good. The issue was the price. It ended up being around $160 in the end which is insane! We have no problem paying for good sushi but it was absolutely not worth the price tag. I had just had a feast at Kirala a couple days ago and the whole thing only cost $100 and that included cocktails, toro, and leftovers to take home. I'm going to Elephant Sushi tomorrow night with three other people and I'm positive $160 would be more than enough to feed all four of us and Elephant sushi is BOMB. This place was just just passable. Sigh. \n\nThey've clearly done themselves a disservice with the SF Restaurant Week fiasco.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Rumor has it that Maruya was the first omakase restaurant in San Francisco.  The authenticity is undeniable.  Classically trained Japanese chefs immediately greet you with a warm smile and a friendly bow as you walk through its doors.  Indeed, it's a rare night that you won't hear Japanese spoken amongst Maruya's patrons. \n\nOnce seated by Maruya's friendly staff, jazz music can be heard in the backdrop of this quaint establishment.  With few tables surrounding the sushi bar, Maruya makes for a very intimate dining experience.  It's menu is simple: 3 choices of omakase or a set dinner.   And compared to other so-called \"omakase\" restaurants serving pre-packaged fish by chefs who learned to cut fish by preparing California rolls, Maruya's prices are beyond reasonable.\n\nI have been to Maruya several times and won't bother getting into the details of the meal.  It's menu naturally changes with the seasons.  All I can say is that at the end of every meal, Maruya's dining experience has left me in a state of post-sushi bliss.  The quality and flavor of the fresh fish is matched only by the perfection of their cuts.  Everything at Maruya is meticulously planned, from the delicious appetizers to the omakase menu conceived by Maruya's chefs. \n\nIf you appreciate detail, have a refined sushi palate, or just want to experience some amazing Japanese cuisine, then you have to check out Maruya.  If you're lucky, you might even catch the occasional Hollywood actor or tech CEOs visiting this Mission neighborhood gem.  So book Maruya in advance, prepare for a phenomenal meal and enjoy some sake while you're there.", "author": "Rudy T."}

Warning: you may leave hungry after this omakase, so come prepared. \nAppetizers were pretty but underwhelming. I didn't care about any. After that, the chef started serving us the nigiri  and every roll was mouth watering. The fish was so fresh and delicate, that it melted in your mouth and you could taste every ingredient on the roll. We weren't very hungry to begin with, so 8 single pieces did fill us up. However, I could have continued eating if that was an option- the sushi was delish. Finally, the clear soup was just okay. We ordered a tiramisu desert (separate from omakase), which was also okay.

One of my favorite is Sushi Ran in Sausalito, but I think I have to say...that this beats it. \n\nThe chefs at this place are Japanese and even that says a lot about the food. Now a days, it's so difficult to find real Japanese chefs making sushi and I am so glad that Maruya has them. \n\nWe were greeted in Japanese upon walking in by the chefs, waitresses, waiters, and the host. It's quite a small restaurant, but the inside decor is so nice that it made me feel like I was actually eating in Japan. \n\nLuckily, we had a choice of sitting at either the bar or the table, but after reading numerous reviews about experience sitting at the bar, we decided to sit there and it definitely was an awesome choice we made. We got to see the chefs preparing our food right in front of us, and were able to have a small conversation with the chef. \n\nMy bf and I both ordered the nigiri omakase which is an 8 course meal for $95. Because we were sitting in front of the chef, the chef actually explained each type of fish to us and gave us one by one which I think was a better experience than having served all 8 pieces of nigiri all at once for people sitting at the table. \n\nI honestly can't remember all the food that I ate, but it started off with a daikon soup..I was too busy being fascinated by how the placement and the decoration of my food looked so pretty that I forgot to write down what I was eating... Each piece of sashimi just melted in our mouth.\n\nI recommend getting the omakase, it was definitely fulfilling for me, but for those with a bigger stomach, I would recommend getting the chef's omakase which includes the sashimi omakase and the nigiri. \n\nThe waiter recommended the jinro sake and it was really good too! I believe it was $85 for a bottle, and it was sweet and smooth and it did its job giving both my bf and I a good buzz that led us to buying a shot for our chef!\n\nIt was such an amazing experience, that we would go back.

The restaurant week menu is $65/person and you get to choose between nigiri and sashimi, and we both opted for the nigiri omakase.\n\nHowever, the restaurant week omakase wasn't not what we expected. It was served all at once in a bento box with only 6 pieces of nigiri, 2 small pieces of eel sushi, tamago (sweet egg), and 2 pieces of cucumber roll.

My friend is a local at Maruya, so it was helpful that she was already on good terms with everyone from the hostess to the sushi chefs.

They did not even offer their other regular omakase sets that are $95. \n\n*Please look at the collage photo to see the quantity of food I had for $150 (actual total was $200 with tax, tip and tea) - note that the side dishes are very small. This place cannot compare to other omakase restaurants like Kusakabe, Omakase and Ju-Ni where the prices are same/less but provide more substance. \n\nOverall, poor value and unsatisfactory fish quality for the price. Overly pricey because there were not enough substantial dishes for the full omakase, meaning we were not full afterwards at $150 a person. Upon sitting, we looked at the menu and noticed right away that the Restaurant Week menu is very small with only a couple appetizers, one entree (choice of sashimi or nigiri, I think about 6 pieces) and a dessert. Also none of the nigiri's in the Restaurant Week menu would be pre-seasoned, you would only be given soy sauce on the side. There was no way that amount of food would satiate for dinner. So we went the other route and still found that there was not enough food for the omakase, which was more than double the price of the sample menu. \n\nThe Chef's omakase had two soups, two appetizer courses, a few pieces of sashimi, one piece of grilled soy sauce yellowtail, 8 pieces of nigiri, and for an additional price is dessert. The soups and two appetizers are in very tiny portions as is the usual case with omakase's. The grilled yellowtail was also appetizer sized. That is all fine, however there was not enough food for the main course of nigiri, and the fish on these nigiri's were still *CHILLED*. They were so cold as if they were recently taken out of the refrigerator and some pieces of fish were *STRINGY.* Because of the cold temperature of the fish, they were not appetizing and did not have good aroma or a nice, warm soft texture. It is very surprising, because all other omakase restaurants I have been to have fish that are room temperature and warm up with the rice under it. \n\nAdditionally, the a-la-carte menu was extremely overpriced. Each piece was about $13-15 dollars and some were more - *the uni nigiri was $25 for one piece*. Wow. For comparison, the a-la-carte at Kusakabe is priced mostly between $8.5-$12 and their more expensive uni is $15.  All of their drink items were also overpriced - one little bottle of Japanese IPA was $15, and refillable tea is $10 per person. The drinks could be overlooked, but they do not deliver value for the prices they set. Also, it is seemingly deceptive that their Restaurant Week menu is just a small sample and the food portion constitutes only half size of a normal meal.\n\nOne positive is that the service was superb - the server explained each item and was very attentive.", "author": "K.

I was excited because Maruya's long been on my list of omakase restaurants to try. Unfortunately, the $150 Chef's Omakase was underwhelming and quite frankly a bit disappointing because I had such high, high hopes. \n\nPain points for us:\n- We were unimpressed by a majority of the zensai dishes. Yes, they looked very pretty but lacked in flavor. The cute little tiered box was very cute, but the only item I really loved was the black bean cake on top. The pickled daikon with carrots (I think it was carrots) was WAY too sour that your entire face puckers up ): \n- The overall pace of the meal was VERY slow, or at least it felt that way. It felt like 10 minutes between each item! Another couple got seated a little earlier than us -- like 10 minutes tops -- and the chef/servers didn't serve us at the same time. Instead, it was them then us then them then us...\n- Chef was a bit heavy on the wasabi in the nigiri, which masked the the flavor of the fish a bit =/\n- I may be being picky...But the chef would place the nigiri perpendicular to us, which made picking up the nigiri awkward. Most places I've noticed like to place the nigiri a big diagonal, which is a bit more natural for picking it up. Again, being picky...\n\nHighlights:\n- Nigiri was our favorite part (but sad that you only get 8 pieces of nigiri...I don't think that was worth $150 given how sub-par we felt the small dishes were...)\n- Hojicha was $10 a cup with free refills, but really light and delicious \n- I though it was interesting that the chef asked us if we wanted big shari or small shari, i.e. more or less rice\n\nFood:\n- Cauliflower soup: Definitely salty, but good flavors. It was really hard to drink in the way it was plated\n- Chawan mushi: Very bland and could've used a pinch of salt to bring out the egg and muchroom flavors\n- Tiered box: This came with a black bean cake with something on top that had a gold leaf, pickled radish and carrot plated to look like makimono (BLARGH), octopus with ginger mushroom, and red chili pepper (Has a tiny bit of sourness but not much octopus flavor)\n- Sashimi: 2 pieces of Blue Fin tuna, a white fish that I couldn't catch the name of, and a daikon and beet roll. Blue Fin tuna was melt-in-your-mouth goodness! The white fish was also really tasty, the meat was stiff without being chewy and was sweet.\n- Yakimono: Black cod marinated with sweet miso with lotus root and ginger. DELICIOUS. By far the best dish out of them all. The fish was perfectly cooked, the meat was still juicy and flaky. The sweet miso didn't overwhelm the cod, so good.\n- Nigiri:\nGrunt \nBonito - So very sweet and had a nice meatiness \nAnago - It's such a small piece of fish...They definitely could've either put 2 pieces or cut bigger pieces\nKing Salmon - This came with a butter sauce on top, which the chef then seared onto the fish. Melted in my mouth and the fattiness was perfect. \nJumbo yellowtail (Buri?)\nJackfish, Shima Aji - Pickled wasabi roots on top, such a sweeeet bite of fish\nToro\nHokkaido Uni - Very yum, especially with the sweet sauce on top\nTamago - The egg was good because it wasn't sweet and the chef put a savory sauce on top\nUmimasu (a la carte) - The chef treated this the same as the King Salmon, butter on top then seared it. I liked this more than the King Salmon. It tasted less fatty, and butter complimented it well. But I wish the chef had done something different to it, perhaps something with acid.\nKawahagi - I enjoyed the texture of the fish, but it had a bitterness to it that lingered a bit\n- Dashi soup: Very clean, refreshing soup\n- Matcha Tiramisu: So creamy, but not super heavy. It also had red beans + some fruit inside.\n\nMaruya is more low-key and traditional, which I think is what they claim to be. I have no problem with low-key or traditional, but for the price and the meal we had...*shrug* You can certainly find better. Bottom line, I'm glad to cross Maruya off the list but it's not a place I'd recommend to others or come back to given all the other amazing omakase available in SF.", "author": "Doris K."}

The restaurant was cozy, the service was perfect, and the food was delicious and beautifully prepared (pictures below). We had the $65 omakase tasting dinner - which usually goes for $90+. The set came with a sampler plate of 3 appetizers, sushi or sashimi omakase, and desert (amaaazing creme brulee). I loved getting a taste of so many different items, all delicately prepared. This was my first omakase experience and, though I personally didn't have any benchmarks to compare it to, everyone at my table had a great time.\n\nI loved the thoughtfulness of presentation. You can see their attention to detail in the little things - we were sat in a group of four, and were given alternating coloured trays, each colour matched with its respective set of utensils and dishes. The bathrooms (weird, but seriously, so important) were pristine and stocked with fresh hand towels. And the service was super attentive and professional - each dish was introduced warmly and swiftly, and it never felt rushed nor overbearing. Oh, and the creme brulee was 10/10 - whipped cream, fresh blueberries, the perfect crack when tapped. Would definitely recommend checking this place out! It's a total gem, especially so quietly tucked away on grungy 16th Street.", "author": "Anna H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-28", "description": "If there will be any bias in this review, it might be due to the fact that this is my first Omakase experience. First in a sense that I have never had more than 14 plates in one sitting. I've heard raves regarding Omakase style from The restaurant Omakase, kusakabe and the likes. I enjoyed the experience because it's different. The food as what you'd expect had its highs and lows but as an experience, it truly is a 5 star.\n\nHow I've always understood the term Omakase is that it's a pre fixe meal whereas the chef decides the course and you just enjoy the meal he serves you.\n\nI lost count on how many dishes where served but if you look at my pictures, that's should show you the amount of food you're about to embark on.\n\nHighlights of my meal where the Chu Toro, The trout, The sea bream and the Alaskan Uni. I don't think their fish can get any fresher than this. Prolly if you swim in the ocean and fish for them yourself, there may be a hairline slight difference. \n\nFor the lows of my meal, I'd say the ika, the roasted green tea and the miso clam soup were all underwhelming. Good, but nothing special. \n\nI'd recommend this place if you want to have a dining experience, but be ready to dough out some cash. It is expensive.", "author": "Jan R."}

This was our \"splurge\" meal on visiting SF, and at the end of the day, all I could say is \"Meh\".  The nigiri itself was quite good.  The fish was fresh and very neatly prepared.  Any nigiri you don't need to further dress with soy and wasabi is good.  But I didn't care much for all the other little dishes in the omakase course.  I wished it was just more sushi.  The sake flight was a nice way to experience different varieties.\n\nMaybe I just didn't get it... which is perfectly possible cuz I'm kinda dumb.  Duhhh.

Tonai san seasoned and presented all the sushi so beautifully. \nI loved how he used different seasoning for each sushi too. It was topped/decorated with wasabi-root, sansho-pepper, yuzu-pepper and soy-paper etc, and I've noticed some of the seasoning he used were the very good expensive ones from Kyoto, which you can only get in Japan. And most importantly, all the fish was so good, as fresh as the ones I had back home! Our server told us they import fish from Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. I really loved every sushi he served but especially loved chutoro and uni from Hokkaido. They both melted in my mouth. So delicious!\n\nThe appetizers served before sushi were really good too. Everything they served was very authentic Japanese food which I used to have back home. They also had a very good sake selection. I tried one of the Jyunmai-daiginjyo, \"Kansansui\" which was so good. \nAlso, the service was exceptional, all the servers were very polite and attentive. \n\nIf you are looking for fresh sushi and authentic Japanese food, Maruya is the place to go.\nHighly recommend!", "author": "M M."}

The a la carte prices, however, were ridiculously exorbitant ($33 for ONE piece of toro, $22 for ONE piece of Hokkaido uni, etc.). I have been to many expensive sushi restaurants and this was by far the most ridiculously priced for individual nigiri. Therefore, even though I was still a bit hungry after my omakase, I decided to hold off on buying any additional nigiri and go eat Mexican food immediately after. In summary, Maruya had a very good omakase but the additional nigiri is so overpriced that it was a slap in the face at the end of a wonderful meal. Because of that, I'd much rather go to Juni, Sasaki, or Wako for a better overall experience (even if they're more expensive).", "author": "Roy C."}

It was good but I don't have to go back to this place.\n\nWako and Kusakabe are still my favorite.\n\nMaruya is one of the participants of SF restaurants week and they do omakase for $65.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-09", "description": "Maruya opened just under 3 years ago, in the funky 16th and Mission area of SF, just a half block from the BART station, amidst the gentrifying Mission corridor which still has a fair share of Riff Raff in this part of it from the Valencia Gardens public housing. It has gone through its own turmoil in that short period, with the 2 original Sushi Chefs/investors departing after 1 year, getting a Michelin star, and then relinquishing that star in the 2016 guide. \n\nBut don't let all that deter you from coming here. Because unlike the other high-end Omakase sushi specialty shops like Kusakabe, Wako, Omakase, Ju-Ni and Sushi Yoshizumi, it is easy to get in to eat, and the experience is very relaxing, the food excellent, and the service is great, too. \n\nExecutive Chef is now Akifusa Tonai, who has 40 years experience, yet despite his skill, is humble and soft-spoken, and very polite but not too stiff.  He came from the restaurant at the famed Fujiya Hotel in Kanagawa-Ken, just south of Tokyo near Mt Fuji, in the traditional town of Hakone, home to the famous hot springs, the same Hakone mimicked in name in the San Jose area and the windward side of Oahu for their Japanese gardens. \n\nThe decor is decidly Japanese, with natural wood accents, simplicity, and a nice peaceful vibe. Their is an L shaped sushi bar seating perhaps a dozen people, with some tables behind.\n\nWe got a short notice rezzie at 6pm on a Thursday, and surprised by the small number of patrons, had an intimate and leisurely meal of Chef's Choice sushi, or Chef's Omakase. This included Amuse, Kobachi, Zensai Otsukuri, Yakimono, Nigiri, Owan. There are 2 other Omakase prix fixe dinners of lesser choice and cost as well. \n\nThe courses were nicely timed and presented, with an explanation of each by our attentive server, Tadashi, who is also from Kanagawa prefecture originally. For the Nigiri portion of courses, chef Tonai asked each of us after the first nigiri, if the portion of rice and wasabi were to our liking. My dining companion preferred less rice, I preferred a little more, so he made those accommodations for each succeeding Nigiri course. So although a set menu, there was much personal attention. Also Tadashi poured our Sake for us, and changed the hot tea cups we ordered at least 6 times during our meal, to keep it fresh and hot. We were given hot towels twice, and a finger towel for cleaning our fingers after eating all the Nigiri by hand.  \n\nThey offer a good list of Sake up to high premium ones, and a wine list, as well as other beverages. \n\nI have been to all but Ju-Ni in the Omakase sushi-ya list aforementioned above, and I like Maruya a lot, with it's easy to get rezzie, comfortably paced courses, delicious food, and attentive service.

But do you really need a giant slab of fish that doesn't taste good? The nigiri pieces had way too much wasabi so it overpowered the entire flavor of the piece, the cooked fish and appetizers were all okay but not outstanding. Honestly the best part of the meal was the yuzu lemonade we got at the end as a palette cleanser. \n\nFor $250 (Maruya omakase and Chef's Choice (15 cuts of sashimi)) you can do a lot better in the city.

That's why they provide the small cloth for you to wipe your fingers after each piece. Also don't drench your sushi in soy sauce. Eat it as it so you can truly enjoy the flavor of the fish.  \n\nEvery piece of sushi the chef served us was beyond delicious. The fish was fresh and he gave us generous portions of uni and toro. Each piece practically melted in my mouth. I probably had the goofiest smile on my face each time I took a bite. The toro was so good that I had to get another piece at the very end. \n\nOur bill came out to almost $400 for the 2 of us but it was well worth it. \n\nWe've also been to Kusakabe and I would choose Maruya over Kusakabe any day. The chef was much more generous with his portions at Maruya. \n\nMake a reservation and don't hesitate to come here. A well deserved michelin star.", "author": "Mai Y."}

CO started w an amuse bouche and three apps. Ok. Highlight was last app (trio of XS: boiled spinach wrapped in Daikon w a sweet sesame sauce/paste, grilled halibut w butter glaze and micro greens (fish overcooked and dry...), tuna tartare wrapped in shiso and nori w light soy (?) sauce). Then came 10 pieces of sushi. Mixed response but highlights (various cuts of tuna, aburi engawa, Cali albacore, uni) were EXCELLENT! Finished w a well executed cube of tamago and then a somewhat mediocre miso w clams (caveat: I'm not a fan of miso soups in general). Price was $160 per. Happy overall. Might return despite living in another country (Canada). Nonetheless, I'd rank this experience strictly below breakfast sushi in Tokyo around the Tsukiji Mkt (if you go to the right place).\n\nNote: Place is traditional sushi (best kind IMHO). In other words, don't expect spicy mayo or other quality-obfuscating gimmicks here. Same goes for maki rolls... they only do nigiri and a little sashimi.", "author": "Jiro K."}

I've finally get a chance to try this place after bookmarking for a year. I saved the occasion for my dad's birthday. I was able to grab a reservation about a month ahead. I've also called in and told the staff about the occasion, and most importantly, I would like to be seated at the bar. They kindly called back and agreed to reserve the sushi bar for us. Yay!\n\nThis is my 3rd sushi omakase restaurant in the bay area. I've been to Kusakabe in sep 2015 and then Sushi Yoshizumi in Nov 2015. I am excited to try this Michelin starred omakase restaurant. In this review I will refer back to my previous experiences and also some pros and cons about this place.\n\nSo once you arrived at the restaurant and seated, you will feel like you've went to Japan. The service, the decor, the attitude, they are all presented at a high level japanese hospitality way. One would be serve a hot towel upon seated.\nThere are several options to the menu, they are different kinds of omakase: (1) a more nigiri focused one, (2) a more otsukuri (a well presented sashimi) focused course, (3) a combination of both, which is also the most expensive. We decided to go with the 3rd choice.\n\nYou can view the pictures of the whole mean in the pictures that I've uploaded. The ingredient changes from time to time so by the time you visit this restaurant, the courses will probably be different. So I would like to point out some pros and cons about this restaurant.\n\nPros:\nVery attentive, the restaurant is smaller than kusakabe, thus I feel that the each service staff are much more attentive. They do notice your beverage level and will refill your water for you regularly. If you ordered hot tea, they will bring out new cups of hot tea for you periodically. The staff are also knowledgeable about the courses, they would explain to you each dish when they present each plate to you. Of course the nigiri sushi are presented by the chef.\nThe rice - the best sushi rice I've had so far in USA. Much better than kusakabe and better than sushi yoshizumi. The moisture, the seasoning, are spot on!\nFlow of the meal, you clearly know you are at which stage of the meal. Maruya follows the traditional way where you are presented the amuse bouche, appetizers, zensai, sashimi, grill item, nigiri. tamago, owen (soup) and then dessert. In Kusakabe the course of meal is quite jumpy, there are nigiri before the main course and after. Sushi Yoshizumi is more focus in the nigiri portion of the omakase, which isn't comparable to Maruya and actually good if you want your meal to be more focus on nigiri sushi\n\nCons:\nChoice of fish, you would see most of the fish in other japanese restaurant, I did try some more nigiri after the course. I tried a special buri (hamachi) which were fed with some citrus fruit. I did taste citrus flavor in the buri which was quite good. But other than that most fishes are available elsewhere.\nThe tamago was the low point of our meal, not because it's the last piece before the owen, but it was quite salty. They give you an option to have it with rice or not. Maybe I am too used to sweet Tamago to end the meal.\nParking, frankly the restaurant location is not the best part in town. It's located next to mission street. Becareful what you leave in your car.\n\nOut of the three restaurant, my favorite is Maruya. I had one of the best experience so far and hopefully I will return to this place soon! You definitely have to make a reservation, I saw all the tables were reserved that day.", "author": "Gary C."}

This particular fish for valentines was tuna flew in fresh from Spain and the flavor and fat was nothing like Ive had before.  The overall select of fish and the slight garnishes they used added complex flavors and was a very different and delightful experience.\n\nI definitely want to come back to sample their regular menu but as I understand they change their fish daily and that usually is a good thing for this type of restaurant. \n\nA must try!", "author": "Railroad M."}

The appetizers/small dishes included in the Omakase are lower in quality when compared to Kusakabe, e.g. there was one dish with cooked, run-of-the-mill shrimp. The fish was definitely good and on par, but the experience was inferior because they brought it out four at a time, which some how takes away from the experience.\n\nIf I had $95 to blow again I thought Kusakabe was definitely worth more of the money. For a la carte, Kusakabe also had more fishes to choose from.\n\nOne other thing to note: while the Hokkaido Uni was very creamy there was a bit of a metallic taste to it whereas I didn't notice that at Kusakabe.", "author": "Thomas C."}

Slightly above average but presented nicely. The price? For what you get, highway robbery.\n\nWe came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner after I made the reservation back in March. My boyfriend had been talking about how much he wanted to come here since he loves quality sushi and he was really excited that we were coming here to celebrate. When I made the reservation over the phone, I was impressed by how efficient the hostess was. She asked me if I wanted to sit at the sushi bar (which, of course we did) and if we were celebrating anything special so they could customize a dessert. The one thing to note is that they do take a credit card and if you cancel less than 48 hours in advance, you will be charged. They are very up front about this, though, and I think this is a good policy for how small this place is.\n\nAnyways, we arrived on Friday night for our reservation and were sat immediately at the sushi bar. The space is beautiful and very simple. I really like the open design and the sushi bar was very deep. I will say that it felt a bit cramped with my fellow diners but that usually comes with the territory. The service throughout the meal was quite gracious but I will say that it felt like the waiters were standing over us the whole time. Again, this may be a space issue.\n\nWe both opted for the Nigiri Omakase ($95) and just drank water. We couldn't in good faith justify spending $10 on tea and we weren't really feeling sake. From start to finish, the meal was...fine. I do not entirely know the names of what we were served but it consisted of an amuse bouche (great), some other small appetizer (decent), a lacquered box with 3 small dishes (okay), nigiri served 1 by 1 by the sushi chef, soup (salty) and the complimentary dessert for my boyfriend's birthday (Matcha Tiramisu that was good in theory but wayyyyy too much Matcha). The sushi was fresh. The presentation was beautiful but really, there was something missing. I cannot honestly say that the food was anything better than I have experienced at other, less expensive restaurants. My boyfriend spent the whole time comparing it to his favorite spot-Shiro's in Seattle, WA and he felt that this place fell short. Needless to say, for $240 including tip, we felt a bit duped. We are not surprised that this place has lost its Michelin star as it does not hold a candle to other high-caliber restaurants in SF.", "author": "Carrie W."}

The restaurant itself feels more casual and spacious than Omakase and Kusakabe, which made the whole dining experience a lot more comfortable.\n\nThe sushi chef was very friendly and would educate us on the different fish we were trying. The proportion of fish to rice was extremely generous, and each piece was perfectly cut and fresh. We went for the more expensive omakase out of the 2 options, and it was definitely very worth it.

Kusakabe is more FUSION while Maruya is practically all nigiri so I think it depends on what you're looking for. \n\nYes it was a Michelin & now it's not BUT I think it's because Maruya doesn't exactly have anything special (like special fusion plates/cold dishes) compared to the others. \n\nI will say that the fish here is well worth and the cuts are a generous size! Check the menu online before going to see if you think it's worth. They have 2 different omakase choices. I recommend splurging a little if you can and getting the chef one (because I mean, how often do you go back?) \nAlso, try and ask for a sushi bar seating! It enhances the experience even more by being right where the food is made. \n\nThinking about the uni from Hokkaido has me drooling ah.", "author": "Annette L."}

My bf took me here on Friday for an early Valentine's Day dinner. We had reservations at 9pm, but got there around 8:45pm and they were able to seat us right away. We chose the Maruya Omakase and it consists of 9 rounds (I was able to take pics of all the rounds except for round 7 which had ika and unagi nigiri - sorry, got too excited for my food). Each round had their own distinctive flavors and they were all delicious. My favorites were: custard with mushrooms in round 2, amberjack fish in round 4, otoro and uni nigiri in round 8. The otoro was super buttery and I can definitely say that was the best otoro I've had so far. \nOne thing I didn't like was that the food didn't come out in a consistent time frame. The first couple rounds, we got our food within 5-10 minutes, but after that there were rounds where we waited at least 20 minutes before our food came out. I also noticed another couple came about 30mins when we finished our third round and they somehow caught up to us. \nThis place is about a block and a half away from Bart and easily missed. We initially walked passed it and had to turn back. Although this place is super pricey, I definitely want to come back again. Excited to see what else they'll serve.", "author": "Renee Y."}

We got seated right away at the bar, when we were told they only had a table available, so yay! We opted in for the $150 Chef's Omakase and started off with their $10 tea per person - a bit on the pricey end, but I like my sushi with tea. I had the roasted green tea, Hoji Cha - very satisfying and warm for the cold evening. The atmosphere was a bit cold so it was perfect. Lets get into the food!\n\nOur omakase served in order:\n- Green beans and gogi berry (appetizer): the gogi berry was a hint of sweetness with the savory green beans soup. It was cold and thick, but tasty to clean our palette before beginning dinner.\n- Pumpkin radish pineapple wrapped in leaf (appetizer): Asethetically pretty with a woven plate under the pumpkin, radish, and pineapple cubed cake wrapped in a leaf. The leaf is not edible so we took that off before sending the entire piece into our mouth. It was interesting mixing the tastes of pumpkin and pineapple, but the taste came out more savory than sweet.\n- Cutest 3 leveled box ever: (1st level): Black bean jello: interesting flavor, but was more savory than sweet too, (2nd level): Tuna: cooked pieces in a dish. Very savory and rich in flavor, (3rd level): egg pudding: probably one of the most bland dish I had of the evening, but it helped neutralize my palette after eating the savory cooked tuna pieces. \n- plate of 3 different sashimi: (left to right) Bluefin tuna: The chefs started off with this nigiri and it only got better and better! The sauce they put on top was super tasty with the fresh tuna, aori ika squid (bigfin): never had this before, had an interesting texture for squid, but it was super sweet before applying soy sauce/wasabi, and saba: amazingly fresh!\n- Sweet miso sauce on Spanish Mackerel: this sweet miso sauce was slightly glazed on most nigiri and it was such an amazing taste added to the nigiri. Mackerel was amazingly fresh and sweet.\n- Cooked seabass with ginger: a little dry, but the flavor was all there with the crisp to the edges.\n- Nigiri pieces: Snapper, Golden-eye Snapper, Shima aji, Fighter fish, Salmon (a little charred), Scallop, Otoro, and Uni: each nigiri piece just got better one after another. Sweet fresh seafood! Usually not into uni due to the fishy taste, but the uni was super soft and not nearly as fishy as any other uni I've had in America. \n- Tomago: complimentary with the meal - my favorite part of this was the restaurant logo stamped on the tomago - sweet, but not too sweet; perfect in texture and taste.\n- Halibut soup: super bland halibut, but the soup was slightly better tahn the fish itself. Probably one of my least favorit dish.\n- Yuzu lemonade: a tasty ending to our meal with slight carbonation and a strong lemonade taste! We all super liked this drink!\n\nOverall experience was excellent! Definitely one of my top Omakase spots next to Kusakabe :) We felt full after, but not overly full so it was perfect. The only reason I didn't provide 5 stars was because of the fly that kept flying around the bar that was a bit annoying to fan away every so often. Aesthetically each dish was beautiful and one of the freshest sushi I've had in the city. Definitely want to return :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

A great Japanese restaurant will know how to take you to a higher place, how to offer a sophisticated full-circle experience from sea to table, a great meal that reminds us how wonderful it is to be alive, to be alive to smells, colors, textures and flavors.  True, there are few joys in life as grand as that of a great meal made with passion and creativity, with respect to the fish itself, and therefore, these moments should be treasured and reserved for special occasions. Maruya is a restaurant where wonderful memories are made, a place for special occasions, a place to impress your date, your family, your friends or your coworkers.  \n\nWhen you consider the countless minute details that need to be attended to inside and outside of the kitchen, the sheer scope and depth of your dining experience suddenly hits you, the commitment to excellence will amaze you- yes, you have entered sushi paradise. Maruya takes its food seriously.   \n\nLike most great things Japanese, Maruya has an unmistakable simple elegance to it; Maruya is modest about what it does so well, exceedingly sublime dishes that start with the best quality ingredients, the fish sourced directly from Japan, that are transformed by its chefs into culinary narratives and refined masterpieces to be eaten.   \n\nI highly recommend the house sake, with the unmistakable Maruya calligraphy circle design on its label, to accompany your meal, ours was served in whimsical ice-cold metal sake cups shaped like upside-down Mt. Fuji's, the sake was smooth and slightly sweet, and then you can move on to their vast array of other sakes and wines to chose from.\n\nA short note about myself, l am a native San Franciscan who lived and worked in Japan for ten years.  My Japanese partner and I have had our fair share of fine food in Japan and so we can both whole-heartedly recommend Maruya if you are looking for that special dining experience you will not be able to find anywhere else in the City.   \n\nI wrote a short poem to commemorate one of many highlights that evening:\n\nA snow crab leg clawing its \nway out of a big leafy tangle, \nwhile I forage the forest \nfor fragrant mushrooms... \nwith chopsticks.", "author": "Anthony Z."}

Make a reservation (ask for the bar) and allow yourself a couple of hours.\n\nQuite possibly one of the best meals I had in 2013 (birthday meal to boot) and I enjoyed every last minute of it up until I was so full I was getting groggy sitting at the sushi bar. \n\nWent with Masa's omakase and it was everything I had thought it would be. There was soup, a couple of cooked dishes, some sashimi and tonssss of nigiri. A lot of the fish was flown in from Japan and I had never tried them before. Masa will keep feeding you until you cannot eat anymore. Although I was starting to get full about 3/4 of the way through our meal, I tried to hang on and devour it all. Food coma followed, believe me. \n\nWatching Masa work was beautiful. He can appear standoffish and stoic, but deep down inside is a man happy to make sushi for those willing to try everything. When we were done with our meal, he opened up and talked to me for a bit. So much about him reminded me of my favorite beloved sushi chef who passed away last year (RIP Toshi Sasaki). It's truly obvious that Masa (short for Masaki Sasaki) pays a great amount of attention to detail. His knives, the chopsticks, the cutting boards - they're all specially engraved for him. The interior of this place is gorgeous. The dark wood is finished very well. \n\nIf you want high quality fish, gorgeous ambiance and a beautiful show, then make it a night for Maruya.", "author": "Susy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-17", "description": "3.5 STARS\n\nOne of my most expensive habits is sushi. None of that Kiki or Kitaro \"IGotTheHersheySquirtsNow\" crap. Don't get me wrong, I use to eat at those places every week when I was in college but once you've tried the good stuff, you really can't go back to eating bukkake topped jive ass rolls.  \n\nWhat I love about date nights is I get to choose the place for dinner and he just has to show up. Hmmm but after seeing last night's bill, I'm not surprised if he stands me up next week. But anyways, having such an affinity for sushi, I picked Maruya for date night last night. \n\nGrand opening on Tuesday, Maruya took over the old Bar Bambino space in The Mission. Parking in this area of the Mission is much easier and I was easily able to find non-metered parking last night. \n\nMaruya is a traditional Japanese restaurant serving no CA rolls, no bento boxes, and no teriyaki dishes. You can't get any more authentic then that. The Japanese sushi chefs are Sasaki-San (Sebo, Hecho & 2G Japanese Brasserie) and Hide-San. You can order nigiri and sashimi a la carte but the only way to go at an authentic sushi restaurant is omakase. They have two omakase choices: one from Sasaki-San which is a mixture of cold and hot dishes, sashimi and nigiri ($85) or strictly a nigiri and sashimi omakase from Hide-San which ranges in price. There's also Moriwase (platter) on the menu that's more affordable at $40 for sushi and $45 for sashimi. Here's the menu: http://bit.ly/1etWqod.\n\nWe requested Nigiri Omakase from Hide-San where the sushi chef will continue feeding you until you tell him to stop. BEWARE: unlike other sushi restaurants, Maruya charges by the piece and NOT by the pair so your tab will quickly add up. One uni nigiri for example is $7 which is very expensive IMO for the area. For those familiar with Akiko's in the FIDi, the prices are pretty similar so expect to spend about $100+ for the Hide-San's omakase. More if you're a hungry and less if you're not. Our 22 piece nigiri omakase was about $113 pp.\n\nThe complimentary Sunomono which is a mixture of lightly pickled veggies: http://bit.ly/1etZoZV  was a nice start to our omakase dinner. \n\n*Omakase Part 1: http://bit.ly/1gOcFyn\nBlue Fin Tuna, Big Eye Tuna, Scottish Salmon, Kinmedai (Golden Eye Tai), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Sanma (Mackerel Pike),  Ebodai (Butter Fish) & Kurodai (Black Sea Bream)\n\n*Omakase Part 2: http://bit.ly/19TWlZM\nSaba (Mackerel), King Salmon, Kampachi (Amber Jack), Mirugai (Geoduck), Kamasu (Barracuda), Big Tuna Chu Toro, Blue Fin Chu Toro, Blue Fin O-Toro & Uni (Sea Urchin)\n\n*Omakase Part 3: http://bit.ly/19UdX9W\nIkura (Salmon Roe), Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Hotate (Scallop) & Tamago (Sweet Egg Omelet)\n\nCollectively, the fish selection provided was some of the best AND freshest I've ever had. You can tell that the fish was flown in from Japan that day as each piece tasted like it was freshly plucked from the ocean; oh so buttery and silky. There were four standouts of the night. First, were the toros with the king of all toros (O-toro) being so phucking good we had to get two orders of. Then, there was the insanely creamy uni with a fluffy texture which unlike any uni I've ever had; and this is coming from a uni whore. Next, the foie gras of the sea, Maruya's ankimo was so spectacular that it rivals Ino's. Lastly, was the tamago. I'm usually not big a fan of tamago but Maruya's was so delicately sweet that it sufficed as a dessert.\n\nIMO, top-notch fish which Maruya has should be eaten naked. They don't provide any soy sauce or wasabi. Instead, they dab a bit of wasabi onto each nigiri and then brush housemade sauces that best accompany the fish. While this is the traditional way of preparing sushi, I think Hide-San got too sauce happy as he heavily lacquered a majority of our nigiri which completely masked the clean ocean taste. Considering that their shari was already very well-seasoned, the over saucing ruined the integrity of the fish. Since each piece averaged about $6-7, it was a complete disappointment on that end.  \n\nOur omakase ended with a complimentary shot of their Yuzu Lemonade which was so refreshing: http://bit.ly/1gOcFyn. They should consider offering this on their drink menu as there's currently no non-alcoholic options; not even soda.\n\nService was very polite and attentive as one would expect from most traditional sushi restaurants. Our water glasses never went empty which is always a good sign. \n\nJust like their food, the ambiance was minimalist in design with lots of wooden cabinetry, tables, and furniture. Reservations are highly recommended as there's only 10 seats at the sushi bar, and 8 two-top tables in the dining area. \n\nAlthough the fish quality was spectacular, I can only give Maruya 3.5 stars because of the over saucing of the fish and the very high prices for the area (rounding up for their grand opening).\n\n#RamenBowlsForTheRestOfTheWeek", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The place is in pretty low key on the up and coming side of Mission. I first saw this place just passing by and was caught off guard by the very Japanese feel of the place with its Zen like wood motifs. \n\nIf you are going to dine here, make sure you sit at the sushi bar. My friend booked us and for some reason we were seated at a table.. Even though it was an off night, and there was plenty of seats at the bar, they wouldn't let us move. Nothing wrong with table service, nor them not letting us move, but let me just state that not sitting at the bar dramatically impacted my experience at the place.\n\nThree of us ordered the omakase, with the fourth ordering the sashimi set. I found the fish extremely fresh, and amongst the freshest I've had in SF, but I felt the fish selection was generic. The overall portion size was good, and I left just full. My friend's sashimi set seemed much more aesthetically arranged and with more food, so I thought that was a great value if you aren't itching to try the omakase. Nigiri was presented in the Jiro-style with each piece pre-seasoned with the seasoning the chef feels is right. Overall I felt it reasonable to my palette. The non-sushi/sashimi dishes were pretty good and very pretty, but I wasn't blown away.\n\nWhen each round of food came, the waiter explained what everything was in quick detail. This was a disappointing part of the experience since we didn't see anything be prepared, didn't engage in any conversations with the chef, and omakase was the omakase-lets-give-everyone-the-same-if-they-aren't-allergic kind of omakase. Other reviewers say the chefs aren't so chatty either.. but it might be cool to see your food be made.. (As an aside, I went to Zushi Puzzle a while back, and the chef there was super talkative and informative.. and enticed us round after round in his never ending omakase.)\n\nThe decor of the place and aesthetics was pretty solid. Cups and plates were super posh stoneware and clay with so much depth.\n\nAt about $170 per person including tax, tip, and one bottle of sake, I was a little underwhelmed. I might go back at some point, but it will be a while.. and only for sushi bar... and I'd hope to find a more diverse fish choice.\n\nBottom line: super fresh fish, only go if you make reservations at the sushi bar, and its pricey.", "author": "James S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "As others have mentioned here, if you're coming for SF Restaurant Week, you should reconsider this deal.\n\nThis is not the regular omakase that they normally serve from the menu. It's super misleading because the restaurant week menu named it exactly the same as their regular menu omakase. I asked them if the quality is the same as the regular omakase and was told - No, they don't use the same quality fish as their normal omakase and don't include everything. Well, that just killed the deal.\n\nI ordered the Sashimi Omakase from their Restaurant Week menu and my boyfriend ordered the Nigiri Omakase. First course was 3 small appetizers (seaweed gelatin, bite size cooked fish, and a potato puree). Second course was the \"omakase\" aka a sashimi platter containing 10 pieces of sashimi - what you would know as a sashimi appetizer at any other Japanese restaurant. I definitely wasn't full after, and for $65+, you kinda expect to be. The Nigiri is the better deal because at least the rice is filling. It included 6 nigiris and a few random other pieces. I think it's pretty embarrassing for a former Michelin starred restaurant to serve cucumber rolls in a omakase set. Additionally, omakase nigiri is usually pre-seasoned and flavored to perfection by the chef and it's a no-no to dunk the thing into a giant bowl of soy sauce. Well, that was exactly what Maruya expected us to do. I now know why it's not as esteemed as other omakase restaurants in SF. Third course was a small bowl of fish soup and we finished it off with creme brulee. \n\nEven if you're not coming for SFRW, ask yourself if you'd really want to spend $100+/person on a place that cheaps out like this... and consider instead the tried and true omakase offerings in SF for the same price. \n\nNote that you must cancel your reservation 2 days prior or be subjected to a $30 charge per person.", "author": "Venus L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "This was by far the worst omakase experience my girlfriend and I have experienced.  We made a reservation after looking at Maruya's restaurant week menu.  The website gave the impression that Maruya would be serving their normal $95 omakase for $65 during restaurant week.  On the surface, this seemed like the rare good value from a restaurant week menu.\n\nWe immediately realized we were in for a terribly disappointing meal.  After being seated at the sushi bar, we were asked to select from the nigiri or sashimi omakase.  We both chose nigiri.  When our order was placed we saw our \"sushi chef\" take out 2 bento boxes.  He took out pre sliced fish from the fridge and began to make pieces of nigiri.  Rather than serving it to us, he placed each of the 6 pieces in the bento box without any seasoning.  We thought he'd present the bento box after completing.  Although this isn't ideal, we'd receive all the sushi at once.  However, to our surprise,  he quickly took the bento box to the kitchen.  We were soon brought our first course which was not the nigiri.  The items were forgettable at best.  We were brought our pre-made nigiri 30 minutes after it was made.  I've never seen any 3rd rate sushi restaurant pre make and hold sushi much less a former michelin starred restaurant.  As you can imagine, the sushi was pretty awful.  The rice had hardened while the fish was something I'd expect out of a convenience store.\n\nDuring our meal we even witnessed our \"sushi chef\" hack away at fish.  While making another table's nigiri, he realized the pieces were not the same length.  We couldn't believe what he did next: he cut an end of the biggest piece so all 6 pieces of fish were uniform in length.  Any sushi chef with any pride in their craft would be horrified.  \n\nWe were hoping Maruya would try to attract new customers after losing their Michelin star.  Instead, they proved to be an embarrassment.  We'd much rather take our business to an establishment that takes pride in what they do and  provides their customers with quality reflective of the cost.", "author": "Alex M."}

I was excited to try Maruya after experiencing Ju-ni since it was the same concept but it definitely didn't hold up to everyone's reviews about it being amazing. My sister and I took my dad here for an early Father's Day dinner and we decided to go with the $150 Omakase dinner which included sashimi and nigiri options. First we ordered tea which by the way is $10 a cup (free refills) but it's the same price as their desserts.. Weird. Then we ate the first three courses that were just ordinary and not really memorable then came the sashimi which consisted of salmon, yellow tail and something else. The nigiri had snow crab, eel and two other types of fish. I felt I could have gotten more bang for my buck at Amami sushi in San Mateo where their Omakase is $30 for 10 pieces. We chose to order a green tea tiramisu to share after our meal which was $10 and it really was just tiramisu with green matcha powder sprinkled on top. I've made better tiramisu before. In total, the bill came out to be $500+= (3x$150(omakase)) + (3x10(tea)) + ($10(dessert)) + tax. My sister and I split it and gave 20% because it's never the servers fault if the food wasn't good. I was a server for 5+ years so I know how it is. \n\nJust saying it wasn't worth the money because the nigiri and the sashimi weren't anything special. At Ju-ni they smoked and torched certain nigiris and it was amazing. If you're sitting at the bar, maybe the experience is worth the money but the food definitely isn't.

I have been going to Japan all my life and this was by far the worst sushi experience ever.\n\nNever in my life had I wanted to tell the chef before our Omakase sushi marathon even started to \"STOP serving us!\"\n\nOur apps were delicious but the minute they served our sashimi course, I was ready to walk out. We ordered our usual chefs Omakase and they serve us sashimi that we couldn't even finish. Sure it wasn't not fresh, but it was super market grade sashimi.\n\nOur grilled fish course before that was equally disappointing. Chilean sea bass?? Are we at citisuper Hong Kong? Which by the way is a grocery store. On top of that, the fish was way over cooked. What a disappointment.\n\nThe sushi course was a disaster. I saw the uni collapse from the woman's nigiri next to us. While our other neighbors went to the bathroom, the other chef plopped what looked like the size of a small onigiri of uni on top of their banana leaves.\n\nWith that said, their toro was delicious. Not enough to save the meal.. And why is their tamago so ginormous??? After seeing other customers eat it I decided to pass on it although it's my favorite item to end an Omakase. \n\nWhat an absolutely HORRIFIC sushi experience!!! \n\nThe chefs were joking around with each other, look, I get that you're from Japan and think now that you're in America, people don't know sushi as much. \n\nThat doesn't mean you can make a mockery of sushi art. As a sushi chef, you should at least respect the One michelin star that your precious colleagues worked so hard to earn. \n\nWhen I mentioned I could not eat wasabi, the first piece of sushi was filled with it. Instead of being extremely apologetic he just said \" oh I'm sorry! Hahhaa .. Won't happen next time!\" Is this a joke? \n\nHOW did Maruya allow these two extremely unprofessional chefs to take over the previous two chefs?\n\nI always had high regards of Maruya and even considered taking my mom here if she visited. \n\nIf she saw the scene today she would've gotten up and left.\n\n** However, am happy to say that the desserts were still good and service was top notch! Total 5 star Stella service and bathroom was extremely clean. \n\nMaruya should consider turning itself into a japanese dessert bar in the mission instead of a sushi bar thats for sure going to loose their michelin star next year.\n\nOn top of that, we saw two couples that took the liberty to sit on counter seats when they became available.\n\n** Note to diners like these: This is not a BAR in the mission. Sushi counter seats are the most desirable seats and unless the hostess directs you to sit there, it is not \"free seating.\" \n\nWill definitely NOT be returning to Maruya as long as they keep these two chefs. Absolutely horrible experience. Thank god for my bottle of sake.. Should've totally stayed home to watch the Victoria's Secret show instead.", "author": "Amber S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-19", "description": "Summary\nDefinitely worthy of the Michelin Star! \n\nHere's a place to take VIP friends from Japan (read it is definitely pricey $$$+) for a high quality omakase with an American twist. \n\nExpect fish with unique flavors (and at times you have to try something out of the comfort zone as a result of Omakase -  leaving it to the chef. \n\nWalkthrough\n\nFor me, I had to eat some salty seawater fish with skin and sea eels that I previously didn't like), unique appetizer (my Japanese friends were actually very curious about these small plates with a new twist) and specialty desserts like green tea latte, peach belly covered in white chocolate, red bean pudding in a cranberry like puree with a sweetened chestnut hidden inside the pudding!   \n\nMaruya is one of the places that I don't want to review - it's something so precious that almost hesitant to share. I was here when they first opened, before the Michelin and after the Michelin... and goodness they never failed to give me more pleasant surprises. \n\nHere we go, since this is an expensive place, I will give you a sh*tload of info to do your planning ;-) some of my friends love planning their meals in advanced. Took two non-sushi connoisseur (didn't like fishy things) here both reported to have started eating more sushi everywhere. Yay!\n\nSushi Menu (had quite some trouble understanding it the first time, took a picture and google the sh*t out of it)\nCategories:\n1. Hon Maguro - tuna, this will include the medium and fatty tuna\n2. AOMONO - \"blue stuff\"\n3. SAKE - salmon, i know i got a bit thirsty thinking about sake too\n4. HIKARI - the \"shiny\" stuff, lol, i am interpreting this as fish with shiny skin... to be updated with more legit info\n5. SHIROMI - the \"white body\" fish\n6. KAI - shells find pencil shelled clam etc here\n7. OTHERS - find uni/sea urchin here,  tamago / egg\n\nEach item is marked with its origin! personally I am a fan of all things Japan...  :- ) The omakase will walk you through most of these items. The menu changes dynamically!\n\nAppetizers\nThe two omakase menus differ by the number of appetizers you get, the price (set price versus AQ). The AQ means it isn't capped, you can eat to your heart's content. The sushi chef will keep asking you how many more you can consume and add onto it base on your preference and what he deems to be worth trying today.\n\nSushi Bar Etiquette\nPlease note it is polite if not necessary to order the omakase menu if seated at the sushi bar. Generally sushi bars at top notch Japanese restaurants require advanced reservation, and have very limited availability. Be sure to call way in advanced and get confirmations for large parties.\n\nGood Japanese chefs also take a long time to prep and get your fish ready. Be patient if they are taking their time to polish their knives, check on the nori, or even tasting the fish ;-) Patience is definitely a virtue on the sushi bar. \n\nHaving eaten tons of sushi, I still have to ask the chef to kindly repeat as the names of the sushi is often uncommon and more \"exotic\" delicacy here.\n\nDrink Menu\nThe drink menu includes premium sake (I go with super dry. Premium sake makes premium sushi better - maybe just a wish of the alcoholic me) and some quite interesting wines: red white and sparkling (once upon a time they had J. I loved it). \n\nThe Michelin and the System\nIt's a young restaurant to be bestowed a Michelin star. It's no surprise given the spot clean place, work stations, dedicated though non-convo chefs, decors tea cup displays, menu choice. Attention to detail & perfectionism is stunning.\n\nCulture + Etiquette\nAn interesting fact, did you know that 2008 is the first time Tokyo had more Michelin 3 Stars than Paris? While the rest of the world was impressed, this sent the Tokyo dining scene into a panic. Many chefs rushed to return their crown in fear of being wrongfully judged by foreigners who may not know how to appreciate true Japanese cuisine and thus unable to \"face\" their Japanese customers. The cultural difference played out a quite dramatic episode. When dining at a Japanese restaurant, there is always a cultural difference. It's interesting to find out and be a polite conscientious food connoisseur. You might have heard that even Juro's sushi occasionally dis-invite guests for being loud and unappreciative of the food, or simply don't speak Japanese. While that is over the top, it's definitely to note there are some expectations of etiquette in Japanese sushi restaurants. It's fun to research these concepts online to make this experience more enjoyable. Not knowing the rules isn't quite a problem here in the USA, but great understanding and etiquette is often awarded with special treats and secret menus from sushi chefs. Give it a try ;-) When in doubt, just ask a question and take a risk with the recommendation. An inquisitive stomach with an \"open-mind\" is always appreciated.\n\nWow u read this far! 5001 characters is the limit - just learned! First time hitting it.", "author": "Dilys S."}

That's the one thing that I'd highly recommend. The venue is hard to find if you don't know about it. The outside was very bland - not marked, and seemed like it wasn't even there. The only reason we knew we were in the right spot was the line that was forming up at the door. I watched two people (without reservations) try to get a seat, but they were turned away because the night was already fully booked.\nThe cost of this place isn't too bad, but if you start al-lacarting, you may end up with a huge bill! For a 1-star Michelin, I definitely think that it was a great experience. The sushi was super fresh! If you're a fan of nigiri-style sushi, this is the place for you. Their omakase was primarily all nigiri, with one or two non-nigiri pieces. It's more traditional nigiri, so don't expect crazy oyster-caviar sushi or anything. We were seated at a table in the corner, and the wait staff was very helpful. This was my first time really having nigiri (came based on recommendation from a friend), and the wait staff was able to answer all my questions and explain the different items. I think that if I went back, I would try to get a seat at the bar - I feel that talking to the chef makes the experience a whole lot better (and it's great for newbies who may not have too much experience with the different types of sushi).\nI've had omakase at other places, and I think in terms of experience, I prefer those instead. I might be bias because I like bar seating, but I would definitely come back and try Maruya again at the bar.

The fish is phenomenal here. Definitely let the chef choose the fish for you and don't settle for a table. It's definitely not worth it if you get a table like many Japanese restaurants.\n2. They take reservations for omakase/ the bar. This is a rare thing that doesn't usually happen so super shocked that they did.\n\n\nCons: \n1. For some reason they love giving tuna and the same type of fish (in different variations). I prefer a wide selection of fish so maybe a good thing to note next time to them is to let them know you want to try out a variety. \n2. Wait here sucks. Don't wait and just make a reservation.\n3. There is no soy sauce. You don't need soy sauce and you're not supposed to dip it in soy sauce if you are eating omkase. You're actually supposed to let the chef do it, but for some of them I still wished that there was a little bit more sodium (just my own preference). So having it there wouldn't be a bad thing.

Aji is very flavorful fish but to kill it with over abundance of ginger is a disgrace to the poor fish.  \n\n4.  O-toro-  The O-toro was very fatty.  However it has no flavor.  Its just like pure fat in my mouth.  One of the worst O-toro i have ever tasted.  \n\n5.

Luckily, on the drive from South Bay up, we were able to snag a table here just in time for our arrival. \n\nMaruya is nestled in the Mission district of San Francisco, and honestly represents the wave of gentrification that is changing the entire city I grew up in. Right next to the Michelin-starred sushi shop are boarded-up gas stations and lines of homeless. \n\nInside however, Maruya is a small sushi shop serving excellent cuts of fish. We all had the Chef Omakase ($85 a person) with a good sake pairing that ran around $80 for a bottle. Service could use a bit of work, as we had to repeatedly try to flag down a server to have our sake refilled (they keep the bottle chilled away from your table so that it stays cold), and we sometimes felt we were being rushed through our meal (minus one star) -- I suppose the service is what set's Maruya apart from higher-Michelin-starred places. \n\nThe food was very well executed -- we started with three appetizers consisting of a fresh raw Washington oyster with a light wasabi and ginger seasoning, a vegetable roll, and sea scallops. Then we moved on to the highlight of the meal -- five courses of two nigiris.\n\nMaruya's sushi is simple and no-fuss, presenting two sizeable pieces of fish with complementary flavours side by side. We had three kinds of tuna (ranging from the lean red variety all the way to fatty toro and bluefin which was a great treat), mackarel, salmon, halibut, yellowtail, hake, and uni. There was also a rather-creative vegetable-wrapped tuna dish, which I found less than appetizing (my mum loved it though, so this is probably one of those things you either love or hate), The fish tasted great (as one would expect), although a couple of them were too fatty/oily for my taste as they seared some of the fish with a blowtorch prior to serving. \n\nA nice option at Maruya is for you to continue your meal after the fixed-course Omaksae by ordering additional sushi that you like off of their menu -- we were pretty full after the ten nigiris and three appetizers so we opted not to, but their a la carte menu is diverse and would definitely be something I'd approach on a later visit to the place.\n\nMaruya is someplace I'd come again -- coming out to around $150 a person after alcohol, tax and tip, it's not terribly expensive as far as sushi places go (especially compared with Sushi of Gari and Masa in New York) -- you don't want to cheap out on where you buy your raw fish. It's not somewhere you would go every day (unless your startup just got acquired by Facebook) but it's definitely reasonably priced for what they offer.", "author": "Richard Y."}

He just lacked a lot of the finesse that Chef Hide had when I first went.  I just went to their website and I guess he's gone.  He's not mentioned on there anymore.  \n\nAnyhoo, the rice was also quite different this time, it was not as good.  \n\nFor the price, they really need to be perfect and it was far from it this time around.

I'm sad to say that this meal was just mediocre. First few dishes were good, but when it got to the nigiri, it went downhill. The fish was served way too cold to the point where it took away from the taste. The uni was SO fishy I almost couldn't stand it. Nothing was \"outstanding\". But let me tell you, you do get  a LOT of food for $85.\n\nI heard the owners changed so maybe that's why?

Remember to request for it when you make your reservation! Now with that being said, let's get on with the review.\n\nWe ordered the Maurya Omakase which was an absolute feast and pretty good value in terms of the amount of the quality food you get. I ordered a green tea ($5) for a beverage, and man these guys are on top of refilling your cup, I don't think at any point did I ever get to the bottom of it. We started the meal with a vegetable squash soup. Then came a medley trio of tofu, salmon pate, and salad. This was followed by an egg plant dish that was fried and served cold. Then a grilled chilean sea bass which was absolutely amazing and one of my favorite courses of the night. Finally, the sashimi course rounded out just the first half of the meal! It came beautifully presented with vivid colors and included a generous serving of amberjack, salmon, tuna, and halibut pieces. \n\nThen came the second half of the meal (the better half) where you are served 8 pieces of nigiri. Each piece is carefully prepared and served individually in front of you. Our sushi chef was awesome and funny and made the whole thing an unforgettable experience. At one point during the night, he held up a prawn and danced it around playfully in front of us before proceeding to kill it with his bare hands. We were served a variety of different fish, many of them I had not heard of but were all pretty delicious including isaki, aji, shimaji, kanpachi, toro taku, hobo, fatty toro, and uni. I think the only one I did not particularly enjoy was toro taku as the shiso leaf flavor was too overpowering for me. The uni was spectacular, the guy probably topped the rice with at least 6 pieces of uni! It was practically toppling over when he transferred it to the serving plate. Our chef even threw in a few bonus nigiris for us to try including tamago and squid.\n\nThe omakase was capped off with a bowl of miso soup served with clams, a very soothing and comforting end to the meal. We decided though that we couldn't leave without dessert so we ordered a matcha tiramisu ($10) to split which was delicious, not too heavy which I appreciated. I would definitely recommend Maruya for anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion. I would say it's well worth it for the quality of the food and the amount that you get. I haven't really had much premium sushi so for me this was probably one of the best sushi experiences that I've ever had and one that I won't forget.", "author": "Kevin N."}

The decor is very woody and traditional, yet the place was bright and wide open and simply clean. There were two different omakases to choose from, and we got the one that was a little of everything (appetizer, sashimi and sushi) vs the other one that was more focused on the sushi. \n\nMaruya's appetizers were more on the contemporary side for me--with fresh vegetable you can find in farmers market like beets and tiny carrots and homemade tofu with truffle on it. The sushi, however, were more on the traditional side with not much searing and only focus on using just the fish, ginger and wasabi...no soy sauce and other complimentary sauce and ingredients. You can really taste the freshness of the fish in its form. For certain fish, the chef used a little more wasabi to help with the fishiness...which I mean it helped but I was overwhelmed by the kick of the wasabi, which I did not enjoy.\n\nDon't forget to save room for the dessert. They were all pretty delicious but definitely recommend the green tea tiramisu!", "author": "Mandy C."}

With one exception every dish from the kitchen was terrible. The first item, a pumpkin soup was delicious. It quickly went downhill from there.\n\nVegetable terrine: bland crunchy slimy vegetable brick\nBaked daikon, pickled ginger, yam cake with persimmon: daikon tasted like bland unsalted chip, ginger was like thick sliced gari palette cleanser, yam cake was horrid squishy fishy blob with lightly fruity persimmon. \nOysters: fishy smell and taste accompanied by shell chunks with the meat\nSushi intermission \nRancid fish dish\nMiso with clam: generic Miso broth with an uncleaned clam firmly attached to its' shell and once detached it was found to share all the light delicious texture one might find in a leather shoe. \n\nThe sushi was great, highlights include incredible tuna belly pieces and fresh banana leaf grilled sea eel and another type of eel. Can't fault the chef on his knife work or presentation. \n\nThe ambience is great for a mausoleum. Very little communication between staff and customers beyond very brief dish descriptions. When I say brief I mean I had to ask to clarify the 4 different garnishes on one piece of nigiri as it was initially described as just \"kanpachi\". The restaurant also had a persistent rancid fish odor that was revealed to be caused by yet another kitchen dish we received towards the end of the meal containing fried then marinated fish which was soggy and tasted like low tide. \n\nOne star off for the horrendous kitchen cuisine. The 2nd star off for ambience and stench. The third and final star is due to price. With two chef choice plus 6 more pieces for a total of 16 pieces of nigiri a hand roll and around a half dozen abysmal kitchen dishes our total with 20% tip was over $400. Not even close to worth it when we've done 20+ course omakase in Portland for half that with drinks and incredible hot dishes.", "author": "Daniel S."}

But I needed a fresher perspective for all the visits under my belt, so held off doing so. And for mysterious unexplained reasons, I didn't get my 2014 badge this year. Guess I no longer make the cut. But thanks, it was awesome while it lasted! Thus I contemplated just quitting reviewing altogether, and just do FOBenese tips & checkins. But I would just be setting a bad example for others and allowing lots of various online characters to run amok, while disappointing those who truly appreciate, understand, and enjoy being amused by the shite I write on this site. \n\nLet me also say that it takes a very trained and disciplined mindset to truly understand and appreciate high end sushi. You must be open minded, cast away what you think you know, what you have been used to eating locally. It also helps to go beyond available Western media which at times is too narrow viewed and slanted, made to mystify and objectify till it becomes dbag BS. e.g. you don't see a Japanese director putting out an indie artsy film about the struggles of Ty Flo or Josh Skenes; they do movies about nigiri sushi coming to life with sharp sharky teeth, killing humans while drawing blood (and lots of it) while a sexy female ninja heroine comes and kills the flesh eating nigiri with a katana. And her name is not Jiro.\n\nIf you seek to understand Maruya from the big picture, as well as the chefs and owners, & what they went through to get here, this is essentially an ultimate dream come true for them. And that is, to work in the best environment, have access to some of the best materials, and put their true training, skills to the maximum test to deliver the best possible experience within the realms of reality, in hopes of changing the state of sushi in SF Bay Area and bringing up the quality bar.\n\nWith all that said, yes, Maruya is as close to a proper a high end hybrid kappo/sushi upscale place in Taipei, HK, or Japan, just a few notches below Ginza style high end sushi...(but seriously it's already damn good for SF, be proud!).\n\nHere are a few pointers and comments to those going in\n\n- It's ok if you are hungry, but please be patient and understanding. Wait your turn before your chef gives you his attention after serving other patrons at the bar and tables. You will enjoy your meal a lot more that way.\n\n- Don't yap away loudly and interrupt the peace and vibe of the place. We do not care to hear about your well traveled sushi experiences just because you ate at 15 East, Brushstroke, Yasuda, or that you lived in Japan and want to practice your Japanese with the chef and A$N date like a 3some. Do not try to show off your DSLR camera and superficial sushi knowledge which you learn from the printed menu in hopes to pickup nearby female customers.\n\n- Do not put your hands together & bow like you are in a Thai temple when you thank the chefs on your way out. Makes you look like a serious insensitive non PC Dbag. \n\n- Keep an open mind with trying what they have to offer. Appreciate a range of textures, flavors and feast on the seasons with your senses.\n\n- Appreciate the preparation, staging, process, and every aspect of what the chef does to get a piece of nigiri to you, a lot of work and passion and effort when into it. And it is an extreme pleasure to watch. \n\n- The rice is very delicately seasoned with aka-su (red vinegar) giving it a darker shade than what you are used to. It is not brown rice, and not soy sauce! Appreciate the balance of the fish to properly seasoned sushi rice, and how the two interact with another. This is one of the greats of high end sushi. Educate and train yourself on this before you make erroneous statements.\n\n- The service here is exemplary by Japanese standards\n\n- Fall to winter are sexcellent seasons to eat fish, which have higher than normal fat and oil content.

I have been known to turn a blind eye to any expensive meal if it blew me away. I think what feels conflicting about the cost of this meal is the fact that it's located smack in the middle of a dodgy neighborhood. So you nervously park your car, walk past a homeless person or two covered in blankets, and then step into a fancy Japanese restaurant to drop hundreds of dollars on tiny bites of delicate sushi goodness. Something here just feels a little dirty. But I digress..\n\nWe ordered the Chef's Sushi-based Omakase, as opposed to the other Omakase option with mostly cooked food. It was nothing short of delicious, and I appreciate all of the meticulous attention to detail and design that make Maruya an excellent dining option -- especially for a special occasion. \n\nI only had one major gripe through this entire meal, though it's purely subjective. In our omakase, they gave us way too many pieces of white fish (mostly hirame) that I felt was \"filler\". I can appreciate a piece or two of engawa or hirame. However when I'm getting several pieces of that in a row, and getting charged an arm and a leg for it, it irritates me. I would have loved to have some uni, mirugai, ikura, and ankimo! I realize this is nit-picking since omakase is all about trusting the chef. But like I said, this was my only gripe. Otherwise, great dining experience at Maruya! \n\nIf we go back, we would definitely sit at the sushi bar where we could interact with Hide-San (aka give him so much sake that he forgets how many pieces of toro he's given us and \"turns a blind eye\" on the case of uni.", "author": "Amy M."}

But for a taste of that style and preparation go to Maruya. They stick to nigiri, sashimi and a limited selection of cooked dishes with no rolls.\n\nTL:RL review-love sushi and sashimi not dosed in fake wasabi and soy sauce, like uni and fish other than salmon and tuna and are willing to pay for high quality fish then this is the place for you. Want a roll or cheap eats, this is that place.\n\nIt was really clear to us if we could just order only sushi/sashimi or if we were expected to get omakase or the smaller Moriwase.\n\nWe decided to get the Maruya omakase which is sasaki-san with the mix of prepared dishes followed by sushi and sashimi.\n\nThe dishes that started off the omakase were pretty enough that I took a picture which I almost never do. It was trio featuring house made soft tofu with uni on top, a toro tartare with tobiko & gold leave on it and a pickled veggie served in a miso sauce. I think they must have had a surplus of hirame (fluke) because we were served three preparations of it, 1. seared where it was overcooked and bland 2. sashimi, large pieces 3. nigiri. We then were served cold soba noodles in a chilled tomato broth. Next was the sashimi selection and a nigiri selection. The nigiri was a variety from artic char to uni. The nigiri was prepared with a tiny bit of wasabi and sauce by the chefs and the only sauce we had was for the sashimi and they poured it for us from a bottle they bring to the table.\n\nFor 15 we order sashimi ankimo, the pieces that came out were quite large but not prepared in the way I am used to. It was delicious as good ankimo always is.\n\nWe finished with a bowl of fish miso soup with tiny clams in it.\n\nWe had many cups of excellent buckwheat tea. And were offered Yuzu lemonde as a palate cleanser when we were done. \n\nThe service improved as the meal went on and they say we actually enjoyed the food. The noise level would have been good expect for the very drunk wives at the table next to us who got louder as the night went on.\n\nCertainly it's one of the more expensive options in SF for sushi but it's also some of the highest quality of fish and preparations I've had in the city.\n\nThe space is wheelchair accessible including the bathroom, the lighting is excellent and the decor is wood in a very contemporary but Japanese style.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

There was a good combination of cream, cake and matcha. It was slightly sweet and you can taste the bitterness from the matcha.  Also a tip, when sitting at the bar, you eat nigiri the traditional way, which is with your fingers. they even give you a wet napkin to wipe your fingers in between each piece.

The sushi bar is the best seat in the house! We ordered the Omakase Masa's course for $85 and paired that with some Sake. At the beginning of service, the chef asks if you have any preferences or what you can or can not eat. Each dish is beautifully constructed and sometimes, is too pretty to eat! Each dish is also spaced out, which I love, and is delivered at a smooth pace. By the end of the meal, I was so stuffed. \n\nExpensive? Yes, but the quality of fish fits the price tag. The dining experience is also worth checking out. I felt as if I was dining at an establishment in Japan! Service was great. The chefs are super nice and will often times chat with you. \n\nTip: Make a reservation and sit at the bar! Also, when you receive the nigiri course, you will be eating with your hands/fingers (for any germaphobes out there).", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

So we decided to just end it after 17. I believe they had over 30 different kinds of fish that night.  I just couldn't go on.\n\nThe last \"nigiri\" was miso marinated mozzarella, which i didn't enjoy either.\nThere's miso soup in the end which I didn't really enjoy. \nAnd you finish with a yuzu sparkling ade.

Service was beyond polite and was super pleasant, and I thought the food was pretty good.\n\nThere's are 3 options: Chef's Omakase ($150 for some more items), Nigiri Omakase, and Otsukuri (sashimi Omakase).  They let us all order different ones, which really nice since so many places make everyone order the same.  \n\nThe server helped us with a sake choice, and we really liked the Tomio Genshu.  They also have more wine than most sushi places, so we started with a bottle of brut rose.\n\nFor the Nigiri Omakase:\n1. Amuse: blue fin tuna topped with hijiki seaweed, pickled cucumbers, on top of cucumber gelee. I thought the highlight was actually the seasoned beet on top with the wasabi root \n2. Kobachi: lightly breaded fried fish pieces in a sweet vinegar sauce with dried fish egg and micro leaves \n3. Zensai: a really cute lacquered box with 3 layers that opens up with small dishes. I loved the presentation on this\n  a. Edamame tofu with salmon roe: the tofu was interesting - very smooth\n  b. Dried hirame and dried tuna: it came with gingered apple slices and dried persimmon. The tuna was amazing and was almost like tuna jerky with intense flavor and an interesting texture\n  c. Somen noodles: with a peeled cherry tomato and tomato soup with dashi - very light and refreshing\n4. Nigiri: \n  a. Hirame\n  b. Yagara with yuzu: cornet fish? I had never had this before, but it was good with the yuzu\n  c. Shima aji: my absolute favorite. it was mild, very smooth, and well seasoned\n  d. Hotate: always a favorite of mine \n  e. Kohada \n  f. Sumi ika (squid)\n  g. Chu toro: I actually preferred this over o toro \n  h. Hokkaido uni: served on a spoon over rice \n5. Owan: a clear soup with kanpachi and a hint of yuzu at the end. It was very clean and a nice way to end \n6. Tamago: I like that theirs has the rice inside the tamago and seaweed around it.  The flavor and texture on the egg were really good\n7. Dessert: green tea tiramisu with a complimentary with a birthday candle. I love anything green tea. There was a bit much mascarpone for me, but that's just my personal taste\n\nSome additions they had for the Chef's Omakase:\n- Sashimi plate with aji and kanpachi (the kanpachi was really good)\n- Yakimono: white miso marinated grilled salmon with pickled ginger - good flavor \n- Special pieces for nigiri: o toro, ama ebi (actually not slimy!), the fried shrimp head, anago one of my favorites) \n\nI would have ordered more of the shima aji and tamago at the end, but I was so full.  Overall, I wish the rice had a little more vinegar, but that's just my personal taste. \n\nWe came here for a birthday, and it was very nice that:\n1. They were able to accommodate my request for sushi bar seats\n2. They brought us a free dessert in the end\n\nIt's not a huge place, but it's not overly crowded.

Maruya is a small and fancy looking sushi joint that could be mistaken as a place that serves fusion type food, but it is actually a very traditional Japanese restaurant. They have a lot of imported fish options from Japan and the fish they serve were all top notch quality but very reasonably priced. \n\nFor those of you who has been to Sushi Sam and would like a comparison, I would say fish and rice quality wise, Maruya definitely came on top. Their price is comparable to Sushi Sam's, but the size of the sushi served was smaller. The Chefs at Maruya also were more skillful in their cutting and putting together the sushi vs. at Sushi Sam, the seaweed wrapping the uni is always soggy and everything just seems to almost fall apart before it reaches your mouth. \n\nI would have given them a 5 star if I am just rating them based on their sushi alone, but I have also tried their cook food and side dishes, and not only were they nothing special but a few dishes even tasted weird, so I knocked a star off. If you love sushi and want the best quality and selection, I would highly recommend Maruya. However, I would recommend you just stick to their sushi menu and avoid the cook food and other side dishes all together.", "author": "Sherry Y."}

I guarantee Maruya is dropping from 4.5 stars very soon if they keep up with the quality they delivered when I visited.

I enjoyed some of the cooked side dishes, like the pickled greens. Everything else was mostly mediocre, including basic cuts of tuna which tasted extremely fishy and chewy. I have had a better order of tuna at Benihana! The rice wasn't cooked through and poorly seasoned; it was so bad that I scraped it off the nigiri because it was ruining the flavor. The wasabi was jolting in a bad way.\n\nI think one of the low points of the meal was when I saw the empanada place closing up shop across the street, and wondered where 4th meal was going to be at.

I understand that Restaurant Week is when restaurants put their most mediocre work in \"tasting menus\" to make patrons feel like they're getting good deals, but any good sushi chef would be embarrassed to serve food like this. I really hope this isn't representative of their actual omakase (not that I'll return to try it), but the fish were very pedestrian and a complete rip-off for $65 - tuna, salmon, scallop, poorly-cut red snapper, mackerel, cooked shrimp, and bouncy, saucy unagi. All of the fish were dull in appearance and tasted old, and the rice was cold and compressed way too tightly - I've honestly had better quality from Nijiya's sushi case. Let me qualify all of this by saying I'm perfectly okay with commonplace fish - it doesn't need to be all fancy katsuo or kinmedai or inada, etc. but if you're gonna do ordinary fish, for heaven's sake don't heinously overcharge for it, and take some freaking pride in your work. Simple: use fresh fish, make good rice, and you can still make perfect sushi (case in point: Sugarfish, $22 for infinitely better than this place).\n\nThe other courses were okay but not enough to make the price tag even remotely worth it: the zensai was inoffensive enough, the owan soup course was a centered around an insipid, overcooked piece of sea bream, and the gobo cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was unimaginative and too sweet.\n\nAlso, not sure if entirely valid, but I probably should have gone with my instinct: never trust a sushi restaurant that has an ugly website, and definitely don't trust one that uses the font \"Impact\" (http://www.maruyasf.org).", "author": "Gary L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-20", "description": "Wow, Yelp actually cut me off at the 5000 character limit for this review.\n\nConclusion about Maruya? They are a mediocre sushi bar hiding their arrogance behind a well-deocrated space and a Michelin star. Goes to show that Michelin stars aren't the be-all end-all of culinary experiences, and that despite your awards, there are a few bad apples in the bunch. Since eating at Jiro Sukiyabashi (from Jiro Dreams of Sushi) in Tokyo, I haven't eaten sushi--but I relented to Maruya on account of my friends & critics who all said they had the best sushi outside of Japan.\n\nStarting off with our reservation, I was thrilled to hear that they could take a party of 3 at 8:30. The hostess told me over the phone that there would be a party finishing up, but that they anticipated us to wait no longer than 5 minutes if we were to come at 8:30. Fair enough, I appreciate the transparency. We got there and ended up standing in the back for 40 minutes, totally unacknowledged by the 3 servers milling around, to be seated. What is the point of a reservation if you're going to be standing around for 40 minutes?\n\nIn hindsight, we should have just walked out then and there and saved ourselves $500 for one of the most disappointing Japanese meals I've ever had in my life.\n\nAnyways, moving on, we were seated next to the window a bit past 9PM. We ordered the Maruya Omakase and the Sashimi Moriawase. They started us off with a carrot ginger soup to reset our palates, and then we moved into three appetizer courses that lasted us about an hour. None of them were memorable, and we were unknowingly charged EXTRA for these. She didn't ask us if we wanted them, and I certainly didn't enjoy them. Just be aware of this if you eat here!\n\nMoving onto the most important part, the fish. Some highlights in the sashimi moriawase included the scallop sashimi, chu toro, and octopus sashimi. The chu toro had some chewy parts, which was strange, because it's quite a fatty cut of tuna that is supposed to melt in your mouth. The scallops were amazing, the most memorable part of our dinner. However... one thing I couldn't appreciate was that all of our sashimi came out stone cold. It was harder to distinguish textures and flavors of the different fish because everything was COLD.\n\nAt this point, there were 3 empty seats at the bar, and we asked our server if we could switch our seats so we could have a better view of the sushi chefs who were making our food. She came back and told us we couldn't, because the last bar seating was at 9PM. You know, maybe if they hadn't made us stand around aimlessly for 40 minutes, we would have made it, but she was unwilling to accommodate.\n\nMoving onto the nigiri, most of the fish were great quality. Some of my favorite included the sea bream, the tuna wrapped in shiso at the end, and the uni. There were a few that were fibrous and chewy, like the salmon (salmon is never supposed to be difficult to chew like that), that were big surprises for me, and they put a DOLLOP of wasabi inside each nigiri. There were 3 times out of our 8 nigiri that I sneezed and teared because the wasabi heat was unexpectedly shooting up into my nose. On top of that, with each nigiri we picked up, the slightly undercooked rice almost instantly fell off--that is NEVER supposed to happen with well-made nigiri. Never. I've seen apprentices in Japan publicly shamed for letting this happen, and here it was, clear as day, for every nigiri we got.\n\nWait, let me get to the best part. Dessert consisted of creme brulee, tiramisu, and mochi ice cream. Did I come for Japanese, or did I come for Costco? Needless to say, we didn't bother with dessert.\n\nOf course, it doesn't end there. Maruya also doesn't accept Amex, despite the fact that most of their customers footing a $500 bill will probably own, and prefer, to pay with Amex. What is the only reason some mom-and-pop businesses do not take Amex? Because they're cheap and they don't really have regard for the customer's convenience.\n\nAll in all, there were so many things the restaurant could have done to make sure we had a pleasant experience, despite the mediocre sushi. They could have checked up on us while we were standing around, they could have let us sit at the bar, they could have brought us a printed menu like we had asked, they could have offered us tea or water (that's right, they didn't offer us tea or water), they could have asked how we were doing or what we thought of the food, they could have explained the menu or dishes coming out, and they could have tried to at least fake caring about the kind of experience we were getting as customers. If I were an anonymous Michelin inspector, you bet damn well I wouldn't give them a single star.\n\nI absolutely refuse to recommend this place to anyone. Take your love for sushi and love of delectable food, coupled with kind and knowledgeable service, somewhere else because there are plenty of places in the city that will do you better than Maruya can.", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

The set comes with red miso soup (excellent), small hijiki amuse, and kobachi. We then ordered housemade tofu with uni, ikura, tamago and matcha tiramisu, which were all excellent. \n\nTea was refilled every few minutes and service was prompt and friendly.

The cabinetry behind the sushi bar is beautiful, sharp, modern and functional.  I saw the chef taking the blowtorch from one of them.\n\nWe both had masa's omakase ($85 pp) and it was fabulous!  It took a few dishes to get to the fish dishes (trio of homemade tofu, mountain peach-berry/chestnut/gingko berries, poached tomato in broth).  Grilled salmon with skin was delish!

My boyfriend and I ordered the Nigiri & Otsukuri.  After we ordered, the waiter gave us hand towels to clean our hands.  Unfortunately, the towels were cold, so we didn't even bother to use them.  I have never been served cold hand towels at a high end Japanese restaurant, so that part of the dinner is a disappointment.  \n\nThe food was not bad but I wouldn't say it was great.  The fish selection was very limited, mostly salmon and sea bream, and the hot dishes were just alright.  It almost made me feel that they are trying hard to spend as little as possible on their food but charge highest price point as possible.  Standard Japnese resturants usually offer hot tea, but this place charges $10 for tea, so we pass on that and only opt for water.  In my opinion, there will be no tea worth $10 per cup!  \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been to Omakase($200 per person) in Soma and An Sushi (less than $100 per person)in Japantown, and both time made us feel money well spent.

We ordered the $85/person omakase which came with traditional dishes along with sashimi, soup, and 8 nigiri pieces. To tell you the truth, when the first few dishes came out, I was somewhat disappointed, but this all changed once the first two nigiris were served. We regret not opting for the nigiri only option, which was half the price!! Well, now we know...and now you know. \n\nMy favorite part of the omakase meal was of course, the nigiri. The fishes they used were so fresh and just melts in your mouth, like other Japanese restaurants I've eaten at in LA. The salmon was incredible and so was the uni, but seriously, every nigiri we had with the set was heavenly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "This is exclusively a review of the Chef Omakase which we made the mistake of getting.  Our mistake, your gain, once you read the review at least. \n\nSo what is the Chef Omakase you ask?  Is it what a previous Yelp reviewer described as the chef serving you sushi until \"you cry uncle\"?  Or is it just a way to maximize the restaurant's revenue at the expense of unwary patrons?  \n\nLet's see how it works...  You make your order, and then you start getting served.  \n\nYou start with getting a tiny shot glass of pupkin soup.  Then a few minutes later you get a little plate of 3 teeny appetizers.  They were good, with the homemade tofu in a truffle oil particularly impressive.  An interesting way to begin.  \n\nFollowing these, you're offered a little plate of super fresh and tart ginger to clear your palate.  Yum.  And so the fish starts coming out.  \n\nEach of you gets 5 plates of chef's choice fish, with 2 pieces of fish on each.   So that's a total of 10 nigiri.  You finish your nigiri, feeling still a little bit hungry, and the waiter asks you if you'd like anymore.  Whatever you order now is no longer part of the set omakase price.  We ordered 2 more nigiri each bringing us to a total of 12 pieces of a sushi a person.  Each of the nigiri is thickly cut and expertly prepared with quite a bit of flavor to each cut.  The slightly pickled sardine was a particular marvel. \n\nWhen you're done with that, you're presented with an absolutely outstanding clam miso, which in my opinion was the standout of the evening, and I don't even eat clams.   \n\nI'd talk more about the miso, but it was the bill you're shown next that really shined.  The bill (for 2) looked like so...\n\nAP - $60\nSushi - $232\nDrinks - $30\nTax\n\nOkay wait, so what's the AP I ask?  Ah yes, the waiter explains, the AP is the appetizers.  So, just to summarize, we ordered the Chef's Omakase.  It's price was AQ.  I asked on the AQ and was told it would be around $115 per person.  \n\nSo just so everyone is clear.  yes, we did pay $400 for...  2 cups of sake, 2 cups of tea, 3 (x2) small plates of appetizers, 1 (x2) shot of pumpkin soup and 24 pieces of nigiri.  And yes, yes that does come out to approximately $10 per PIECE of nigiri.  \n\nIt was all tasty, but whether it's worth it to you, that question I can't answer...  For me, when I get a chef's omakase for $115, I expect a little bit more fish, and I would suppose that the fact that I cede the control of what I eat to the chef, for it to not just be a few things from the nigiri menu at the prices shown there, plus appetizers, that, had I known they'd cost $30 a person, I'd rather have not had.", "author": "Leon K."}

Like, the kind that makes you snootily compare it to Tokyo (you know, \"when I was in Tokyo...\" or \"there's this place in Roppongi...\" yeah, that annoying person? That's me). And really, I was perfectly pleased.\n\nI'd made reservations far in advance and we showed up on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately. We both opted for the Masa Hide Omakase, which is essentially Executive Chef Hidebumi Sueyoshi's choice of whatever he wants to feed you. \n\nYou're offered a welcoming dish (ours was a small bowl of thinly sliced seaweed), followed by some housemade silken tofu (topped with uni, or if you don't like uni, some black truffles), some steamed octopus in a vinegary/wasabi-like mixture, and an oyster. \n\nAt this point, I was starting to get full, but I pushed through to the nigiri portion of the show. Here, you're essentially given two pieces of nigiri (sushi atop rice) until you cry uncle. We made it through a good deal of pieces, the notable favorites being: maguro (tuna), shima-aji (striped jack), sake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail), and the blue fin o-toro. Every single piece was delicious. You're given a small bowl of pickled ginger and nothing else. It's traditional Japanese food; you're not gonna get your spicy aioli with that tempura-battered roll. It's simple, artful, in-season fish.\n\nAfter crying uncle, we had the owan (clam miso soup) and ordered dessert, despite being insanely full. I opted for the warabimochi served with a ryokucha latte (chocolate mochi with a soy green tea latte; perfect shot from Ken K.: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maruya-san-francisco?select=59jFxTRfEPIbHi4YtswbNg#59jFxTRfEPIbHi4YtswbNg).

I'm sure the fish they source is good, but storing it this way just takes away the richness of the flavor and the butteriness of the texture.  It really is a waste.\n\nRice lacks the immediacy of properly prepared rice.  Also suffers from being stored, which similarly results in it being on the cold side with muted flavor.\n\nI'm sure when the chefs eat their food, with freshly cut fish that isn't re-refridgerated, and rice that's at the peak of flavor, the sushi is probably really good.  But as it is, it is just a sad disappointment.\n\nNow, credit is due to their fish selection.  Watching my neighbors seated next to me at the counter get served fish that's in season, the same fish that you would get in February at a proper sushi joint in Tokyo impressed me.\n\nBut the truth is sushi has always been about the rice.  I would rather have plain tuna fish with mayo on good rice than the great fish with meh rice.  I guess I'm saying the fish selection doesn't make up for the uninspiring, though not entirely incompetent, rice.\n\nNo matter, it's not like there's much choice in SF for proper sushi.  There's Maruya, Wako and Kusakabe.  Each have their issues.  But out of the three, Maruya is probably the one I will return to the least.\n\nStill, the meal wasn't without its highlights.  The tamago was pretty good.  Not particularly creative or fancy, but I liked the flavoring.  Akadashi miso soup was pretty one note and disappointing.\n\nWhy can't we have at least one decent, almost as good as Tokyo, sushi place in SF?  I guess that's being kinda selfish.  NYC only had two decent sushi places as of 2013.  I have yet to find a good sushi joint in LA or anywhere else in the States.   Guess SF is just another disappointment.", "author": "Jason C."}

We brought the baby and thought it was weird that they seated us and another couple with a baby at the very front of the restaurant. \n\nBaby and I came in first. I put her in the high chair and gave her the menus to play with. She is 10 months and just loves to flip pages in books. The waiter came over and took the menu from her hands. I thought it was odd. She was not ripping it up or anything. So i gave it back to her. He came over a second time to take it from her and told us not to play with it. I might understand if the menus were made of gold or something. But I looked closely and it was two pieces of paper clipped with a clothespin. they had soy sauce on them. this was after the waitress had already come over and warned us that the chopsticks were very sharp. which was legitimate. i asked for avocado for the baby but no dice. the couple next to us asked for hot water and there was some big hoopla about that too. to the point where the other mother was like \"i cannot feed my baby?\"  I also felt like if they dont want kids at the restaurant, just say so. I had called another sf sushi place and they had a no child policy. better to be up front so there are is no awkwardness. I also don't know if the servers were trained to be that way - rigid, my way or the highway. Maybe that is what they wanted to project? was an aura of discipline and strictness\n\nI think Maruya tries to be a higher end sushi restaurant but misses on some aspects. I have never been to Jiro but I would imagine that is what they are trying to achieve. The clothespin which held the menus together and chopsticks were branded with the name but seemed a bit homemade? points for effort but looked a bit sloppy. I would imagine higher end restaurants also make the customer feel right at home. no one was making any outrageous requests but everything seemed to be met with a \"no\" or some weird explanation\n\nwe ordered two Chef's omakase and a bottle of sake. I think the value is not there. The experience can seemed overpriced if you factor in how we were treated as customers. The food is good and quality is there. For the price we paid, we could have easily had a feast of good quality sushi elsewhere without the attitude", "author": "claudia y."}

I can't really recall what we had because it just wasn't that memorable. There was a broiled salmon course that was slightly on the overcooked side, but the skin was delightfully crispy. \n\nThings didn't really pick up until the nigiri came. Extremely delicious chutoro and uni. The chutoro was slightly torched on the outside which helped render the fat and gave it that melt in your mouth sensation. I'm not sure which uni they used in the omakase, but it was really fresh and clean tasting. Without any icky fishy flavors, the richness was really emphasized and made me want to eat more of it. I added an order of ankimo, and it was probably one of the best I've had. Its texture was really smooth and silky, and there was no fishiness to get in the way of its delicate flavor. The rice was also notable. The texture was slightly firm so I could make out each individual grain. I'm not sure what it's seasoned with, but it tasted less acidic than most sushi places, and I liked how it paired with the various fishes and shellfish. At the end, I had the gluten free version of the clam soup, which was pretty awesome. There was a lot of clam and umami flavor in the broth, and it had a roasted kombu flavor that gave it a gentle, almost smoky hint. It was a pretty godlike soup. \n\nI think I enjoyed my experience at the bar more than the omakase. I was able to get all the good parts of the omakase while adding other stuff I wanted. I haven't seen gindara (black cod/sablefish) on many sushi menus around here so I wanted to try that. If you've only had misoyaki black cod, this is really worth the try. The texture is a little firmer, and there's a delicate sweetness that disappears when black cod is cooked. The only cooking method that preserves this raw flavor is steaming, which is my favorite way of eating black cod. \n\nThe live botanebi was a fun thing to order. You can see the shrimp squirm around as it's being prepared. The shrimp was really sweet and succulent, but they put on a little too much lemon juice for my tastes. The fried heads that came afterwards were also really well made. The crispy legs and shell with the rich goopy stuff inside had a very nice contrast. I got the same clam soup again, and it was just as good as before. My friend thought mine was better than her regular version of the soup. I think I could have an entire meal of just that clam soup, and I'd be pretty happy.\n\nOverall, Maruya is a pretty great sushi place. Grab a seat at the bar, and just enjoy.", "author": "Nei N."}

When the plate of uni came out, it was enough uni to feed four people. I LOVED it. The uni from Japan had a very unique taste. I don't know how to describe it- slightly strong but it didn't bother me. You can definitely taste the difference between the two. \n\nWe didn't do the omakase but we ordered a LA carte which still has a minimum of $80 (per person). I had three different types of fatty tuna in addition to the uni- VERY delicious. The tuna melts in your mouth!  We also ordered mackerel and another seasonal fish (sorry forgot the name).  \n\nSo it comes down to the service which I was very disappointed in. I'm not sure if they were short staffed but our waitress was very behind on our requests and forgetful. I felt like the service was not up to par. This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. \n\nFood is amazing and I think I would come back solely for the delicious uni and tuna. Vibe here is very casual- no need to dress fancy! I wouldn't recommend huge groups, it is definitely more of a date place. You want to impress your date with some expensive yet delicious sushi? Come here!

The wood pieces they've chosen for the bar and the wall are really nice; it felt like Japan. Regarding the food:\n\nWe got both the Maruya omakase (cooked food and 8 pieces of sushi) and sushi omakase (10 pieces of sushi). \n\nThe cooked items were very well done. I had a miso glazed sea bass that blew my mind. There were also very nice salads and small plates, where the flavors were thoughtfully balanced. The truffle soft tofu, for example, was savory, creamy, and perfect.\n\nThe sushi was a bit hit and miss (mostly hits). For a one Michelin star restaurant, it is surprising how much the sushi differ between the two chefs. They cut their pieces in different widths, and will have different preparations of the fish in the omakase.\n\nFor sushi:\n\nThe amazing/transcendent: torched kinmedai, torched and seasoned anago, uni double stack\n\nThe whatever whatever: the sashimi did not taste as amazingly fresh as the best sushi restaurants in SF. I thought the blue fin tuna particularly tasted like it may have been frozen a few times. \n\nOverall, for the money, you may want to try Wako if you want cooked and sushi items, and Okina sushi or Sushi Ino for just sushi (though the last two won't have the same ambiance).", "author": "Ray N."}

So dining experience at the restaurant does matters, it helps set them apart from their competitors.

Having said that, it is better than 99% of sushi places in the U.S.  The price is reasonable for the quality of the fish and I like the fact that it is serving traditional edomae style with nigiri only.  \n\nThere are a few issues however.  \n\nThe selection of the tuna is not as good as you would expect in a place like this.  My only options were akami and chu toro from farm raised spanish tuna, which by the way, are very good, but I would have expected a few more cuts like o-toro, kamashita, triangle and such.  \n\nWhat bothered me the most was the sushi rice.  I felt that the temperature was a tad bit colder than what I would prefer, but what was critically wrong, for me, was the flavoring.  It didn't have enough vinegar flavor IMHO.  This is somewhat of a personal preference.  I don't want my sushi rice too strong, but their sushi rice was almost non existent in flavor and I felt that this somewhat ruined it for me.  \n\nSushi rice is THE most important part of sushi.  It can make it and break it for you.  You can make a mediocre fish taste good with good sushi rice and when, and only when, you have a good combination of good sushi rice and good fish you can have GREAT sushi, and this place didn't do it for me.

However, i must say, haters gonna hate and aint'ers gonna ain't. Translation: As with all Yelp reviews, each person's review is subjective- really can't generalize sometimes.\n\nNow back to the review:\nReservation process- If you leave a voicemail, they will return your call the next day and answer your questions. I made my reservation by phone and had a special Birthday request, both were handled swiftly and professionally.\n\nMaruya is a small, modern spot that seats less than 30 people. Since this was a special occasion, we went all fancy and went with the Chef's Omakase- 10 pieces by Chef's choice and you can add more at the end. To start off though, we were served (by this order) pumpkin soup, raw oyster with uni, this vegetable conglomerate and hamachi. Loved the raw items. (these are separate from your 10 pieces)\n\nThen we were each given a small platter with a napkin on top for finger wiping, as we were expected to eat the sushi served with our fingers (I've never done this before!). Our sushi chef set up a wooden platter in front of each of us with a cut leaf on top, and started serving away! As he announced each type of fish he was serving, we quickly cross-referenced the sheet in front of us. I had seen complaints about over-serving white fish, but I thought we were given a really diverse selection.\n\nMost memorable for me was the Uni. We watched the chef as he piled the uni on and on and on. I was super excited for it! I had some trouble picking up the soft uni and the rice up though with my fingers, and rather than judging me (like I was expecting), the chef laughed and helped me out. This small incident made the rest of the meal more fun, as the sushi chef made jokes with us the rest of the night.\n\nI was sufficiently full at the end, but my boyfriend requested 3 more. At the end, they served us a green tea tiramisu on a platter with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate syrup. A sweet, delicious finish :) \n\nOverall, with no drinks, our bill was around $315. Though that seems like a hefty bill, the quality of service and food was definitely worth it. Hard to eat anything else after this meal!", "author": "Joanna H."}

But we were so disappointed.\n\nStarted with the $40 10 pieces nigiri with Uni a la cart, thinking we'll start and order a la cart. The server asked if we wanted 1 or 2 pieces Uni nigiri, we said 2, thinking we each wanted one. The plate came, 1 piece in 10 was the same uni that we ordered from a la cart, plus 2 pieces of uni nigiri. Obviously miscommunication between the server and the sushi chef. No problem we love Uni, we'll take 3 happily. \n\nHowever, beside the 1 uni piece, the rest 9 nigiri on the plate were so disappointing that we wanted to leave right away. Boyfriend didn't think the fish was fresh, I thought they were simply less desirable cuts of the same fish they serve at the higher priced Omakase. \n\nWe are both sushi lovers, traveled to Japan numerous times, so we know what good fish taste like. We went in thinking we'll get the best fish in town, totally didn't mind the price, simply wanted to start with something and order a la cart, but it was just so bad. We felt discriminated because we didn't order the higher priced omakase. We never skimp $$ on sushi because we don't think cheap sushi should even be eaten. But what we were served last night, would be a great example of a cheap sushi place would serve that I'd never step in to begin with.\n\nEverything else we ordered a la cart was great, the ocean trout and mendocino Uni was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-26", "description": "One sentence review--finally an A grade sushi experience in the Bay Area!\n\nSlightly longer review--Maruya is a godsend for SF, which until now, did not have a sushi restaurant that I could recommend confidently to foodies from Japan.\n\nIn terms of the quality of the ingredients, there's very little to complain about. They buy solid quality fish and know how to prepare it correctly. One way of knowing whether a sushi-chef knows his stuff is to try the kohada. I won't go into the details of why, but basically it takes a lot of time and skill to make good kohada consistently (kohada is 80% skill, 20% product, whereas other fish such as tuna are 80% product, 20% skill), so if a sushi restaurant has good kohada, you're in good shape for the night. If their kohada isn't shiny and silvery, with the flesh still pink, having the right balance of salt, acid, and a hint of the ocean flavor (not too much), you may want to rethink the rest of the omakase course. Maruya's kohada was very good, so you know they care about their product.\n\nTheir same care goes into all of the other pieces. In particular, I loved the way Hide-san carefully blanched pieces of octopus suction cups in hot water to get just the right texture before serving them.\n\nIn terms of their rice, that is one area where I feel they could use a tiny bit of improvement--I prefer rice that is a bit firmer, where you can taste each grain. My other preference is for akasu (red vinegar) over white vinegar, but that is purely preference. Their rice is still better than anything else you can find in the Bay Area.\n\nYou do pay for the quality of the meal, however. It's not a cheap night out, especially if you go past the normal omakase course and start adding extras, which is hard not to do. So prepare your wallet and your stomach--you're in for a good night out.\n\nIf Maruya was in Tokyo, I'd say that they were four stars--really good, but missing the extra oomph from the rice to push them into magical territory you get from the top top places. They are, however, \"as good as it gets\" in the Bay Area, so they get full marks from me.", "author": "Noah H."}

Super fresh fish, great great cuts and a really nice staff. Had a bottle of dry sake as well made the whole thing great. The toro super great. Had a bit of octopus suckers too in the end made up with a brine, tasted great. The best though by far was the ankimo. Damn that was some fatty ankimo. Soo soo good. 5 giant pieces just dropped in front of me and I was just like OMG I'm in heaven. Also had some abalone, which was the first for me admittedly. I got to say, not my fave but I think that's just because it wasn't good texture for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-12-21", "description": "The only thing worse than bad fish is a lot of it!\n\nLet me start at the beginning.  Just 1 door down from Maruya, was an old guy lying in the fetal position flat out on the sidewalk.  In the doorway he had 2 shopping carts full.  It was so cold and he had nothing but his clothes between him and the cold, hard sidewalk.  I spent the next 2 hours chiding myself for not laying my jacket on top of him.  Thankfully by the time we left, he was sitting up with his carts in the doorway so I got to keep my flimsy jacket.  By this time, after sitting almost 2 hours next to Maruya's windows, I was so freezing myself thru and thru.\n\nWe enter the restaurant and get shown to a table.  I object.  I had noted on my OpenTable reservation I had made way in advance that we wanted the bar.  I had been one of the first to make a reservation for this night as so many times were still available, why wouldn't my request be honored?  \n\nPlus after reading how cold certain bar seats got by being by the door, I had actually emailed them with a picture of the bar with a red X marking the seats I was requesting.  Well, I was told so sad too bad, they do not read the notes from OpenTable or their emails.\n\nI can't remember ever not eating at the bar at a sushi restaurant.  We have sushi at least once a week every week for the last 32 years, we love it that much.   My husband said I would now not like anything all night and he was so right.  But as it turned out, he didn't like much either!\n\nWe did the $85 omakase, Masa's course, which it seemed to me was all made in the kitchen.  So why it has the chef's name, I am unclear.  Definitely not the way to go if seated at a table.\n\nA gal came in and sat at the bar right behind us.  She had on a strong perfume.  I cannot tell you how much strong perfume and not so great raw fish do not mix.\n\nNothing was special, nothing was inspired.   NO PREMIUM FISH; no toro, no belly cuts served in the $85 omakase!   I wonder if Saturday night is not the night to go seeing as they are closed on Sunday and Monday.  Maybe they were out of the good fish or saving it for the bar.  \n\nFirst out a trio which had 2 half's of a mini carrot and 2 mini, mini radishes in a parmesan dipping sauce.  2 pieces of maguro sashimi that seemed to me had been cut much earlier.  Slimy came to mind.  And a very small, warm (good part) cup of tofu with uni on top.  It was like a poor relative of chawanmushi.  Next came out a skinless yellow tomato that had been blanched, served warm.  Well, being late December, great tomatoes are long gone.  Odd came to mind.  Next came the best course, a small serving of Miso Black Cod.  Though Roka Akor had a much better version.\n\nA 3 fish sashimi dish appeared.  I ate 1 piece of each fish and then paid my husband to eat the rest.   Not great.\n\nThen the sushi started appearing all from the kitchen I do believe.   None from their A game for sure.  The fish served at the bar might be a totally different story, but the fish served to us was not great.  Now I admit, I am so spoiled as far as sushi/sashimi goes.  Just last night, we had the best ever fish at Koo in the Sunset.  This fish at Maruya just was flavorless,  some odd textures,  some feeling slimy to my tongue.  The best piece was of maguro.  (Oddly we were served maguro in 3 different courses, the first 2 were not great).  I am too old and too onery  to gag down fish that is not enjoyable, so if my husband told me ick, I didn't even try it.  Not that any of the fish was bad, it just was not good.\n\nThey do not serve wasabi and soy here like Akiko's on Bush (a fabulous sushi spot), but unlike Akiko's, Marayu's sushi screamed for it.  Perhaps if I had that to mask the lack of flavor of their fish, I would have found it more palatable.\nI can't remember a time, I silently prayed for the last course to be served so I could go home.  I was cold and miserable. \n\nThe $85 price tag was ridiculous for what we got.  So we spent $300+ to be unhappy.  The service, BTW was excellent.   We won't ever be back, but if we were, we would walk before sitting at a table.   I think all the good fish was being served at the bar.

On the 1st visit, I had their standard omakase and was impressed by the quality of food and I thought the price was fair ($92/person). On the 2nd visit, my wife had the standard omakase while I had the chef's offering which is listed as MP. The price for the chef's offering was roughly $130. Again, I was satisfied with my meal and I found the prices to be acceptable. However, on my 3rd visit, my entire table opted to have the chef's omakase. The menu still lists the price for this course as MP. When the bill came, we were shocked to see the total for each person's set course was $172 each. Not only was there no expectation there would be a $80 difference in price, but as someone who has had both types of omakase at Maruya I know first hand there was nothing different that could justify the cost difference. At the end of the meal, we wanted to take a closer look at the prices. We attempted to take the receipt that included the cost breakdown per fish, we were told harshly that we couldn't take that. The staff member reluctantly said he would photocopy the receipt, and then handed me an envelope. Upon getting home, I realized the staff member had only provided a copy of the summary receipt and not the page with individual prices of fish. I will not be going back to Maruya. While I know not every restaurant that serves omakase provides a specific price on the menu, most restaurants I've been to that specialize in this whether in San Francisco or Tokyo do provide a cost. The way Maruya handled the pricing and the failure to provide the requested itemized receipt made me feel like we were taken advantage of, and while the food was good there are better restaurants in San Francisco that believe in price transparency. Additionally, on my OpenTable review, I did send a private note to the restaurant, inviting them to respond back to me regarding our poor experience. I received no response.", "author": "Justin G."}

Hubs and I were excited to have discovered this authentic joint serving up some of the best sushi nigiri and sashimi here in the Mission.\n\nThe entire restaurant gives off the zen feel, so upon walking in, we felt relaxed and comfortable. The interior is designed beautifully and the waitstaff are professional, knowledgable and very courteous. So far, so good.\n\nThe menu is incredibly simple, and we have tried both. Maruya offers two types of meal: omakase (chef's selection) or moriawase (assorted sushi platter). Omakase is definitely worth it. The selection changes based on what's fresh, and it comes with small plates, sushi nigiri and sashimi, finished off with a hot bowl of miso soup. But if you don't feel like breaking your bank or you just want some fresh fish, the moriawase will do just fine. It's a solid 10-piece nigiri platter that will leave you satisfied. And if that's not enough, you can always order a la carte (but mind you, the pricing is per piece, so it adds up). I highly recommend the toro and the uni if you want to finish off with a few excellent pieces. \n\nAll in all, we were both extremely impressed. Definitely our favorite spot in San Francisco to get sushi when we can't make it over to Yume.", "author": "Lynn C."}

Arguably from many people who know squat about Japanese cuisine, yes, but now I'm already getting off track.\n\nNo, I'm going to comment on the hospitality here. O-Mo-Te-Na-Shi. (Accompanied by little hand gesture. Ask your Japanese friends about this obscure Tokyo Olympics reference.)\n\nTwo things that really stood out for me during our visit:\n\n1) They've installed little hooks under the sushi counter, so you can properly store your handbags without them touching the floor.\n\n2) Whenever a staffer goes into the restroom, they re-fold the toilet paper ends into a little triangle (like hotel housekeeping does), and re-stack the fabric hand towels into a nice pyramid.\n\nThis point (2) was striking. I just never, ever, ever see this kind of attention to detail in the US. Let alone at restaurants. This is genuine spirit of hospitality, and attention to detail, folks. As a non-Japanese Asian American, I concede defeat to this execution, because we just don't have this in our blood.\n\nSpeaking of details, pay attention to the sushi counter and its construction.

I never write reviews for anything - I know what I like & don't believe anyone needs to prescribe to my beliefs and I don't need to try and change anyone else's ideas about whatever.\n\nI felt compelled to write this review because I felt I was rudely and unjustly served.  I get it: there's a fixed menu, a Chef's menu, and (surprisingly) an al a Carte menu.  I wasn't hungry - at all; but my husband booked this restaurant & I had been away a few days & we just wanted to catch up.  He ordered the Chef's menu & I did a la Carte & let the waitress know I wasn't that hungry.\n\nLong story short, the sushi chef was hostile - why? because I didn't eat everything?  He prepared sushi, when I ordered sashimi & refused to give me the \"fresh wasabi\" even though I ordered it from the start.  All that aside, I was happy conversing with my husband.  BUT, f*#k, we work hard, choose where we want to dine and are willing to pay for it.  Yes, the food was good; but the chef dogged me on the presentation and how much I was eating because I was enjoying the company more than the food?  Shame on you.\n\nI would have told him there & then, but I'm tired of people thinking I'm a bitch bc I have an opinion.

We had friends visiting & decided to try it out again February 2016. We were really disappointed. Last time the omkase was around  $135 per person. This time it was really overpriced. Almost $250 per person & that's without tip. There were 4 of us. We all drank burdock tea which was delicious & there were only 2 beers. It wasn't as if there was much alcohol. When I asked the waiter for a copy of the final bill. His response was that they needed it for their accounting purchases. He did however make a copy for me & slipped it into an envelope. When I later opened it, it was only the final total on the paper. I wanted the itemized bill so I could see exactly what the cost was for the omkase per person, drinks outlined etc. Upon emailing the restaurant directly a few days later & bringing this up with them, there was no response. Kusakabe has a 1 Michelin star & the prices are much lower & the food amazing. I've dined at Kusakabe a few times. Wouldn't find myself going back here again or recommending it to friends.

Our regular sushi chef at our go-to restaurant recently quit, so we're now on the search for a new place. Although Maruya won't be able to fulfill that need (not the kind of place you just drop in on a weekly basis, price-wise, if you know what I mean), we found it while searching for Yelp and decided to give it a try.\n\nI called to see if they could seat the BF and I within 10 minutes, and they told me to come by though the sushi bar was already booked for the night. We knew going in that we would order the omakase, but after eating here, I wish we would have waited to make resos at the bar.\n\nWe opted for Maso's omakase, which came with about 15-20 pieces of nigiri plus some other items. The first dish was laid out beautifully and included an uni chawanmushi, ankimo, and a bowl of gingko nut/chestnutt/plum. The rest is history, though the saba was really the star of the night much to my surprise.\n\nService was on point and during one dish reveal, the waiter accidentally picked up some leaf which somehow fell onto our nigiri, to which he apologized profusely and immediately got us a new dish. That along with our tea cups being refreshed with newly brewed tea cups each time made for an excellent meal.\n\nBill was around $180 + tip. Extremely pricey for just a regular night.

It was a tomato and eggplant dish flavored by tomato sauce.  The sauce tasted Italian in seasoning, and was heavy.  How could that be followed by sushi?  I drank a ton of water and chewed many pieces of ginger to get that basil taste out of my mouth.\n\nThe rice here is not as good as Saru (my current number one sushi in SF).

The food was superb.\n\nMaruya reminded me of an excellent, similar sushi place in Tokyo.  The lighting is bright -- no mood lighting.  It's a brightly lit room.  The tables are arranged so that one diner always has his/her back to the sushi bar.  I agree with another reviewer -- this hurts the experience.  Sit at the bar or don't go.  The place I remember in Tokyo had no tables.  Just bar.  Makes sense.\n\nOur waitress had us a little befuddled right from the beginning.  There are three choices on the menu -- each with different multi course experiences.  One was I think $95/pp, a second was AQ, and the third was something we didn't want.  So I asked the waitress what is the difference between the two, and she said the price is different.  I asked how much is the AQ?  She could not give a precise answer, only an estimate.  I thought that was odd.  \"As quoted\" but we cannot tell you until after you order.  Maybe it should say NQ (not quoted).  After pressing her further she explained that the two selections are the same, except the more expensive one uses higher grade fish.  Ah, ok.  Then I asked about the sake flight (3 kinds) -- what sakes are in that?  She could not answer.  \"We usually try to use . . .\".   Again, very odd.  No \"I'll go check\" or in a Michelin starred restaurant (like this one), \"the answer is . . .\".   \n\nThe fish was perfection.  Two pieces per course.  As good as I have had anywhere.\n\nToward the end of our meal (we started at 8:30 and it was about 10:30 even though we ate fast), our waitress disappeared.  A male, seemingly more competent and knowledgeable waiter took over, but not before we were straining out necks to try to find our waitress.  Again, this happens sometimes, but not in Michelin starred restaurants.  In those, I expect perfection in exchange for the very high price.  It would seem the waitress went home, but did not let us know.  Again, odd.\n\nI ordered additional nigiri after the courses were done.  It was fantastic again.  \n\nThen we had dessert.  Green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (just ok) and sesame and black bean pudding (very good).\n\nThe tab was $450 before tip.  Given $120/pp base plus several glasses of sake, additional nigiri, and dessert, that's to be expected.  \n\nIf money and time are no object, and you like the brightly lit room, go here and sit at the bar (or go to Kusakabe).  If money and time are no object and you prefer a darker room, go to Keiko on Nob Hill.  If you are willing to spend but don't want to sit for 2.5 hrs +, go to Okoze by Hyde Street.  If you are not willing to spend, have a cheeseburger somewhere.", "author": "Michael B."}

Next time I'd just ask for sushi omakase without all the side dishes - and would go for a special occasion, not a random Tuesday night.\n\nReservations: we had a reservation for 8:30 p.m. on a Tuesday for the sushi bar (which I'd recommend over tables) and it was still crowded with people waiting, so would recommend calling in advance.", "author": "Lindsay C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-17", "description": "Maruya is an extraordinary sushi restaurant that has earned its high accolades.  The restaurant is an exceptional aesthetic experience for all the senses.  Its design is serenely beautiful and simple, the food is sophisticated yet crave-worthy and the customer service--I don't know what restaurant Tony V. or Joseph W. visited--is absolutely first-rate.\n\nThe current chef is every bit as gifted as the two who left.  The proof is in the omakase, which consists of fish flown in from Tokyo and expertly cut, prepared and presented.  The rice is warm, slightly sweet and tangy, and each piece the chef presents to diners is crafted with obvious thought, care and homage to the palate as well as to the sushi tradition. Alternating with the sushi presentations are inventive takes on traditional Japanese amuse bouches, like a small shot glass of an umami soup or a simple presentation of Japanese squashes.  \n\nOne of my favorite sushi presentations was a piece of fish on rice wrapped in a shiso leaf -- aromatic and almost explosively flavorful.  I also loved the seaweed pieces that I watched the chef carefully hand-roast in front of me.  My nephew was crazy for the Japanese tiramisu for dessert, with macha powder in lieu of cocoa powder.\n\nI've eaten here three times and plan to do so many times more, and I cannot wait for my next visit.", "author": "Daisy B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-24", "description": "First, let me say that all the people saying the fish isn't 'fresh' here don't know what they are talking about. Why? Because fish for sushi isn't supposed to be 'fresh'. That's right, you heard me. If you think good fish = as little time from water to table then you are wronnngggggg. Yes, wrong. At least for sushi it is. Sushi fish is supposed to be aged like beef. Aging the meat is what brings out the flavor and what makes the fish tender. Watch \"the mind of a chef\" with David Chang on the episode about 'fresh'. It's life changing.\n\nWith that said, I will say that this place was pretty damn good. I don't know if it's michelin star quality but its really good. By far the best sushi I've had in a long time. I got the Maruya Omakase and it contained a wide variety of dishes.\n1. Squash soup: rich and tasty but bland.\n2. 3 dish platter with house made tofu, fish roe, and a salad thing. I love tofu, but this was kinda odd. The salad thing, sorry it was really weird so I don't know how to describe it. It was some cold steamed veggies in this cheesy dressing. The roe was tasty but not that great.\n3. Grilled eggplant with sprouts and cured fish on top. This had great texture and the taste was pretty good as well.\n4. Seared Seabass. The seabass was super tasty but I think it was a bit overcooked.\n5. Nigiri. The best nigiri I have had in my life. All of the fish was amazing. Tender, flavorful and accompanied with perfectly made rice. The only thing I found odd was that the chef cuts the fish ahead of time and then sets it aside until he has to serve. Personally, I'd rather have the fish cut right before serving but that's just me.\n6. Soup. Ending the night with a rather salty soup was not what I was looking for but it was tasty at least.\n\n\nService was great. Super attentive and definitely michelin star quality. Overall, this place is great. I think next time, I'll do the AQ Omakase instead.", "author": "edward k."}

I got counter seat which is very nice because I was able to watch sushi chef's magic hand. Lucky to have a counter but anyway I was treating my self a dinner. Friends of mine will never come with me cause they can't eat raw fish.I have picked hide's omakase from the menu for my first visit at this restaurant.The menu has no price for hide's omakase. So I was wondering what is expecting when my check come after the my dinner.  Muuuuhhh???!! Don't even know what sushi chef will pick for me. I got started from a tiny dish like veggie sunomono, second dish was like chawanmushi in a tea cup. Third dish was a fresh oyster. Forth dish was slice of slightly cooked fish with yuzu oroshi daikon.\nWhile you are having those starter dish hide-san will preparing your sushi-neta right in front of you and count them carefully.once you have done your starter dishes, hide-san will start making your nigiri one by one, some nigiri has lightly seasoning  with squeeze lemon or some pink salt by hide-san's magic hand. I got like 8 pieces of nigiri  omakase by hide-san,then I did requested like 3 more additional nigiri and everthing was made with hon-wasabi for me (extra $5)\nAfter i had those nigiri, hide-san gave me dashi-iri tamago for the last. The waiter will bring a bowl akadashi soup with clam.it is delicious I used have that when I was in japan but not in usa. I have ordered anmitsu which comes with hide-san's little japanese joke (sweet beans with cheanut, stawberry sauce and some fruit with leaf  comes with honey taste like soymilk on side. It is not real anmitsu you can have in japan but it is new creation type anmitsu..  thank you very much arigato hide-san. I will come back next time.

We have been planning for this visit for a while, so there has been quite a bit of anticipation built up for it.  \n\nWe took BART to get to 16th and Mission - got out of the station and we were quite shocked about the neighborhood. In short, this wouldn't be a place that you want to spend a lot of time walking around. We were definitely not expecting this when we got out of the station. But it might just be us being new to San Francisco (10 months since we relocated from LA).  \n\nMaruya was a short walk from the BART, probably around 2-3 mins. There is no sign on the street, so you would just need to pay attention and find their logo on the door.  Overall, the experience was good. \n\nDon't let the 3 stars review fool you - the food quality is GOOD! Both my wife and I had the Chef's omakase. However, I took one star off since the chu-toro I had had a piece of scale on it and I bit on it. Took another star off for the fried sweet shrimp head - it was obviously our order (since the waitress told us that they have only one order left in the restaurant when we were trying to order two). The waiter served it to another table while the couple sitting in the other table was totally puzzled, and we knew the entire time that it was ours.  \n\nAnyways, minor glitches aside (but definitely a penalty for me on the reviews since they are a higher-end restaurant), the main waitress was very attentive, explained everything that was served to us, and gave great recommendations to us on the sake.  \n\nWould I go back to it? Maybe. But all the minor mistakes here and there kind of threw us off a bit. We might want to consider exploring other places before we decide to come back to Maruya again.", "author": "Louie Y."}

Don't get me wrong though, the quality and taste of the fish were excellent. The few things that knocked 2 stars down from Maruya was texture of the fish and the extremely long wait time. Most fish (even those that are suppose to be textually complex) gave me a very mushed impression. I really wanted to like Maruya, especially since a star from Michelin, but their sushi philosophy was just not my thing. So if you are big on freshness and quality of the fish, Maruya is your choice. If you like texture as well as taste, I would go Kusakabe, Wako, or the more expensive, but well worth omakase (yeah, their restaurant is actually called omakase). The second thing that really got to me was the wait time. It took Maruya 4 hours to serve us the Chef omakase ...

We had pieces of sashimi and nigiri sushi, grilled fish, steamed tofu custard with uni, various other small dishes and vegetable preparations, and a soup to finish, along with dessert and a shot of yuzu lemonade.  Standouts were tiny vegetables with a miso dressing for dipping, still crisp white asparagus with strawberry sauce, the grilled fish jaw, and for me - the uni custard (which was fortunate because no one else was a big uni fan, so I got to finish all of theirs).  Sadly, no one liked the mushroom soup at the end and they all sat there, uneaten.  This is definitely an experience to be savored and enjoyed, not rushed.

This is my second time ordering omakase, the first tim was at Wako, also in SF. I was so excited to eat authentic sushi again but had to go home with disappointment.    \n\nWe waited around 15 to 20 minutes between each piece while looking at other tables on our sides getting served with second plates. Even though our waitress did apologize, the wait time was so long that I didn't feel any continuity for the experience as a whole. She spoke so softly that I cannot hear what is she saying unless my whole body is lean extremely close to her. She also did not refill my hot water until another waiter serving another table noticed and filled it up for me. And for the rest of the time, I had to ask to get more hot water. \n\nAside from service, the food was not remarkable. I came in with high expectation from Wako which was superb, and was hoping the same if not more from Maruya. I don't double the authenticity and freshness of the sushi. At the same time, the flavors were really off to me. In one of the appetizer dish, theres 3 mini dish- tofu, tuna cube and salad. The tofu was alright, bland and nothing insightful to me. As for the tuna cube, it tasted extremely fishy and tasted fresh off a cat can food. The salad dressing tasted really strange to me, it was slightly sour and sweet and not to my flavor. There was another salad dish in the appetizer that wasn't to my taste as well. As for the sushi pieces, there is not a whole lot of texture differences, and flavor mostly centered on the fish itself. I feel like the sushi looked extremely grand but the taste is not to par. There is not a whole lot of flavor or even any wasabi on the pieces. If you like plain combo of really fresh fish and rice, then try this place out. For me, I am definitely not coming back again.\n\nThe positive things I would commend on is how clean the restaurant is. Servers are polite, food with beautiful presentation with gold pieces and gorgeous plates. Hot sake was tasty. \n\nWarning** the place can be hard to find because theres no name outside the restaurant. If you see wood decorative inside, you found it! Also they only have fish, no wagyu, etc.", "author": "Fironica L."}

We ordered a bottle of sake, and we both ordered the Masa Hide Omakase.  As we sat down, executive chef Sueyoshi immediately began pulling out fish, cutting slices, and placing those slices on a silver tray on the counter, which he then set aside.  My wife and I looked at each other and whispered that we hoped he was cutting those slice for a sashimi appetizer for one of the tables or something.  \n\nInstead, after we had finished a series of 3 (quite tasty) appetizers (maybe 15 or 20 minutes later), he served us those pre-cut slices as the beginning of our nigiri portion of the omakase.  We watched the chef-owner who was serving other customers and confirmed that he too was pre-slicing and setting aside fish for later service to customers.  \n\nSome of the fish was quite decent.  Others were just ok.  For example, the shima-aji was served with enough shiso leaf and ginger so that you could not taste the fish.  When a sushi place prepares nigiri so that you cannot taste the fish, it always makes me wonder about the freshness.\n\nThe surrounding were very nice.  I found the front of the house knowledgeable and helpful.  The menu showed the sourcing of the fish, which I appreciated.  Sueyoshi-san was very personable (although shy).  We really wanted to like the place for the reasons that other commentators have noted.  That said, I find it hard to get past the pre-slicing of our fish.", "author": "Kazu S."}

Nope, for the price point I've definitely had better, but that's partially because I've been spoiled by sushi in NYC. It was about $150pp with the omakase (although this might have been due to it being a holiday night), and sake. It was definitely a great experience, and the owner was pretty enthusiastic about the entire operation (and the popularity of the place so far), and was doing a solid job of checking on everyone and joking around in a semi-dry manner. The decor's lovely in an elegant, plain way, definitely nothing too flashy to distract from the food. \n\nAnd onto the actual food - we came here on NYE and it was special pricing for the menu, ended up getting the omakase rather than the holiday set menu, and chef Hide was the one to prep it all. (If you want to buy a drink for the chefs here as a thank-you, Hide likes beer, btw!) He definitely knows what he's doing, and seasons and cuts the fish with a deft hand. Each time he placed the sushi on the leaf before us, he'd explain what the piece was, sometimes what he'd do to it (as in why he was searing the otoro and not just leaving it raw, or kinda why he was prepping stuff) and although he wasn't super talkative, was still fairly friendly. \n\nWe also saw a couple splitting an omakase or the pieces they ordered? Somehow? They were sitting next to us, Hide-san was cutting the pieces in half and placing it in front of them. First time for everything.\n\nUni was great as always, and I think I enjoyed almost everything I had (which I don't exactly remember nowadays, but salmon, red snapper, toro, otoro, mackarel, and a couple others were on that list) and was pretty full afterwards. The flavors were quiet, not overdone (think not heaps of oversauced, in your face stuff) but overall definitely fresh and just shy of the border of amazing (so I guess just really good). I didn't like the tofu that much, I found it a little bland and would have preferred they seasoned it a little better or put something on the bottom to eat with, but the texture was good. We got sake with it and were trying to decide between a couple options, and they just let us try sake cups of each, which was a really nice gesture - and in the end, their recommendation was definitely the best :) I liked the green tea tiramisu even if it needs a little tweaking, the other dessert we got was ehhh. \n\nDo I think its worth the money? Probably on a non-holiday night, but even then, if its for a special occasion, definitely spring for it. It's a good experience, but it might not be the best that you've ever had, but definitely what you would probably expect  for the price point. If you like sushi, go! It'll definitely be worth it for you, (p.s it seems like sitting at the bar may net you a better experience), but if you're not a fan of traditionalist sushi, it might not be the place for you.", "author": "Jenn K."}

(This should be a red flag to begin with)  Fine. We didn't think it would take us more than 2 hrs to eat, and we quickly decided to go with the Chef's Omakase for the entire table.  First few appetizers came up pretty quickly but then there were several occasions where we were just sitting there waiting for our next course.  The oysters were a little fishy and so are the over-cooked clams in the miso soup at the end.  Sushi rice fell apart on some of the nigiri as you pick them up, but we let it go as the fishes are fresh in generally. Overall we enjoyed our food.  As time approached to our deadline, we had to flag our waitress to get our bill.  And what happened after that was unbelievable... \n\nAmong 5 of us, we split the bill into 3 portions.  We wrote them down on the back of the bill as we always do at other restaurants we been to.  As we were writing, a lady (manager?) came up and told us, they don't accept AMEX.  No problem. We swapped all the cards, and she took the bill.  10 min later, she came back and told us she can't do the split bills cause the system won't allow it. (Huh?! That's a first..)  She also said that they don't normally take more than 2 cards and made it sound like they are doing us a huge favor.  Then she proceeded to tell us that the party waiting at the hallway had an 8:30pm reservation was very upset the table isn't ready.  As she was telling us these, the party walked out.  And she said \"oh, and they are leaving.\"  What?!!! How is putting the guilt on us making this situation any better?!!  Then it took her at least another 15 min to charge our cards.  Meanwhile, we just sat there speechless... Couldn't believe what just happened.  By paying over $150 per person and charged with 20% default tip, we did not expect to end our dinner at a 1 Michelin star restaurant with this type of service.   \n\nQuestions or maybe suggestions if you care to improve... \n-No disclaimer (2hr limit) was found anywhere on reservation system or advance warning.  \n-Shouldn't you consider allowing enough time between reservations, especially for bigger parties? \n-And, if you know you are in a hurry getting us out, shouldn't you be serving us quicker?? \n\nI'm sorry that the other party walked out.  But the way you handled this, you are not just losing one party, but two!!  We will not return for sure.  \n\nTL/DR: Food is meh; Service is slow; billing process by staff is horrendous, Staff needs lessons in customer service.

I always passed on the Omikase because I've been eating sushi for years and was fishing with buddies in Miami, selling to the then, very new sushi restaurants in the city. Only 2 at that time! So I guess I could be called a sushi snob. I was initially blown away by Maruya because of their extensive offerings and impeccable preparation and skill. Last night we went with friends. One a prominent restaurant owner in the city. Upon walking up to the front, I noticed the glass bordering the street was filthy. Hmm.. Michelin star restaurants sweat the details. We were seated and I noticed the table wasn't particularly clean either. Hmm. Ok, lets order.. There was only two Omikase options? Where is the Ala carte menu? We don't have that anymore. Really? Ok, well then that makes it easy. I guess. The first several courses came out and I have to say were extremely disappointing. There was 1 or 2 that were  \"ok\" but the rest left me wondering what's going on? The sashimi arrived and it was a touch to cold. Not a bigge at a \"normal\" sushi restaurant but not here. Details again. I must say the nigiri was up to the previous standards and was fantastic. Thank goodness because my friends were looking at me strange post the first courses. I looked around and was looking at some of the lighting and noticed the pendant lamps above the sushi bar were quite dusty and looked a bit less than spotless. Again, details. Michelin stars don't get handed out everyday and details are a big part of the experience. It has to be superlative in a city like SF. Now normally, the cost wouldn't be a major point BUT with the sub-par early courses and general impression left by the less than impressive cleanliness, it suddenly becomes one. So in closing, I don't think I'll be going back or suggesting Maruya unless they bring the Ala carte menu back and clean up their act! I'm sure they probably won't miss me. The place was full.

The food was so delicious and beautifully prepared I cannot stop thinking about it. On a friend's recommendation my husband and I had the Maruya Omakase, which is a fixed-price, chef's choice menu. Truthfully, we did not know what to expect, other than we were told it would be be the best sushi we ever had. It was by far the best sushi we ever  tasted, but the beauty of the food and the simple but artful presentation of the entire meal was equally impressive. The chefs at this place are  clearly artisans at the top of their game. The serving staff were very nice and professional as they brought and cleared course after course, never rushing us, as we enjoyed this luxurious meal. After a series of courses that included dishes with some cooked seafood, tofu, and vegetables, the sushi chef (we were at the sushi bar) created and presented us with mouthwatering sushi masterpieces. Each bite was distinctive and delicious. These are not your over-sauced sushi rolls... the sushi you get at  Maruya are delicately prepared and precisely seasoned jewels of deliciousness.  The wine list is extensive.  I opted for a sparkling rose that was recommended by the chef and it was the perfect complement to the meal. The green tea tiramisu was a refreshingly light and sweet (but not too sweet) way to close out an amazing meal. If you love sushi and want a special dining experience this is the place.
