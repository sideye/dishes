Anyone who comes by is capable of pushing a lever, up or down, to get a piece of frozen yogurt.  After couple days of experience, I realized what I've done didn't come out a perfect swirl.  I'm glad I never choose to work at Matcha Caf\u00e9 Maiko.  Some of the staff there made lots of perfect green tea swirls.\n\nYoppi in the 2nd floor of Westfield is a perfect place to do-it-yourself for a bowl of froyo.  There's also fresh cuts of fruits and nuts to choose from.  All real flavors are of good quality, while froyos are tart.  I come to self serve vegan pineapple sorbet.  But what already caught my eye is an a\u00e7ai bowl.  Instead of self serving froyo, its better to tell a cashier to serve scoops of superfruit goodness, which cost little more than a self serving froyo.\n\nIf you ever happened to come and buy a frozen treat without using self serving yogurt machines, Yoppi in Westfield is perfectly good for a\u00e7ai.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

Out of the 6 or so flavors, two (the classic tart and something else) were \"out of stock,\" so, that was disappointing. No seats, so be prepared to take your yogurt down 2 flights to the ground floor if you want to sit while you eat.\n\nAlso for the amount I got, which was not much at all, my yogurt was crazy expensive.

They have all the healthy toppings I like,  but if I want a bit of a treat I can add a few pieces of the cheesecake squares or some toffee chips with my almonds.

I guess I'll go legit and pay for what I eat (only I didn't and instead Abby S was nice enough to foot the fro-yo bill for everyone), if you insist.\n\nThe joint is about the size of a nice, upper-middle class walk in closet so they only offer 6 flavors, but you can vote on their next 'seasonal' flavor on their magnet board in front. I didn't see anywhere to get a magnet dot to place my vote so I just mashed my hands on the board and moved like 30 of them off of one flavor I didn't like to the one I know should be the winner.

I can't tell if it's because the Westfield location is just too small a space to make the product enjoyable or maybe it's because I've been cheating on Yoppi. Yes, I admit it. Ever since Pinkberry and Sogreen rolled into town, I've been conveniently forgetting about Yoppi as a go-to froyo resource. Honestly the only reason Jamie W. and I came here the other night was because we just happen to be in the mall and wanted something sweet to spoon in our mouths as we watched the light show under the dome. We looked at the flavors available and settled on the peanut butter (see photo).\n\nIt was alright, a bit on the drippy side like the machine was acting up or something but not the creamy sensation I remember tasting at the Montgomery Street location. Perhaps Yoppi was just having a bad day and just needs to go to the beauty parlor to fix itself up the next time we pass by. However, with so many other froyo shops around, we feel our devotion waning for Yoppi. It's probably how Hugh Hefner felt when he left one nondescript playmate for another and another and another. Just call me Hef, and at 45 cents per ounce, Yoppi is starting to feel like an aging playmate waiting for the newer, fresher model to come along.

Usually when people ask me if I know any froyo spots nearby, I always direct them to Yoppi.\n\nYoppi DOES have a frequent customer program. You just have to always tell them your phone number. They print you a copy receipt of all the times you've visited and how much you've paid. Once you've hit $50, you get free froyo!

The sample cups are always in a different place every single time I come here, this time I had to ask because it was between the wall and the cash register. I tried the pink grapefruit tart and it was stellar. I threw the sample cup away and asked for a new one to be courteous and hygienic. I also did the girl working a favor by pushing up the handles on every machine for her (I don't like my froyo all melted)! At $.45/oz, I value every bite of my frozen creation. The Irish mint was not up to my code and the original tart tasted like Yogurtland's original tart. So it makes sense that I dispensed mostly pink grapefruit tart and a little bit of original. \n\nI ran for the mango and green tea mochi before anyone else would dig in and ruin it. The green tea mochi was suprisingly easy to scoop and was not sticky at all. The mango mochi, however, was clumped together. I forgot to ask if the popping balls were from Taiwan (darn, hopefully I don't get poisoned) but I only like yogurt-filled balls since the other popping ball flavors are way too sweet and unhealthy. \n\nThe variety of fruits is great but the strawberries and blackberries looked disgusting and I had to call the girl out to replenish with fresh pieces that don't look like spit. I'm getting my berry mojo on now with everything: strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Lastly, I can't forget the crushed graham cracker to top it all off. The total was $5.58 but it all goes into my frequent dining points so only so much closer to $50.", "author": "Dominic T."}

It's a DIY affair so I piled my cup with a combination of flavours (chocolate, caramel and original \"tart\"), bypassing the toppings station to keep my fro-yo pure. Next, my cup was weighed and the guy behind the register joked \"that will be a total of $3.26, if you feel like paying\". I laughed and asked if there was an option not to,to which of course he said \"Well, you could not pay but then I'd have to chase you down in the mall and I guarantee my legs are longer than yours\". It put a smile on my face, as did my cup of frozen awesomeness which lasted all of about 6 minutes.\n\nI really like that you can \"vote\" for the flavours that will be featured next week.

As for the \"white girl\" employee that someone wrote something nasty about -- she is great. She is there every time I come in and has always been very helpful. Maybe, you caught her on a bad day, but it sounds a bit dramatic to me. And I totally get them doing the samples for you. I have seen people make such a mess and totally take advantage when they let you do it yourself. After all, it's a mall, so there are lot's of teenagers trying to get free samples. Besides they grab the cups from the bottom, not putting their \"dirty little hands\" all over it, like that girl said.\n\nTrue, sometimes the place is a bit messy, but it's understandable when it's so freaking popular!

We're a group of eight and I saw a mint flavor that I knew my husband would want to try. I asked my kids to look at the flavors and see if there was something that they wanted to try. As they looked I asked if we could sample. The person gave me one, one tiny sample cup. So I just got a bit of the mint and let everyone have a taste. The texture was good as well as the flavor so I just had my kids get whatever they wanted based on the mint. Wrong!! The original flavor was runny and the white peach was watery. What was good were the toppings however and they had a nice selection. I also thought it was cool that they have a savings program based on your phone number because I always forget the card. But I don't see myself coming too often since it wasn't fantastic and at .49 cents an ounce the costs can get pretty steep.", "author": "Annie P."}

I rarely travel down that way so Yoppi is a great substitute.\nThey have a great choice of flavors, the selection is rather large. Unlike other froyo places the flavors actually taste like what they are suppose to. I would say red velvet and lychee are my favorite flavors. The original and mango is quite good as well. The chocolate tastes very creamy and chocolatey! I think the reason why I like the froyo here better is they taste very creamy, and doesn't taste like artificial flavorings. The texture is rich and consistent. The original is tart but not too sour, and tastes very much like Pinkberry. Besides these two establishments, I am not a fan of any other froyo places.\nThere's a huge selection in toppings too. They have mango and green tea flavored mochis on top of the original. Nom nom nom. \nIt's cool how you can vote for the flavors you want the next week, but I saw some dumb girl rigging it by moving all the magnets from one flavor to another. Bleh! \nI always stop by whenever I am at the Westfield now. Can't wait for some lychee froyo yum!", "author": "Jenny W."}

I've tried both now and weirdly I prefer this location so much more!
