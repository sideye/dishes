Came here on a weekday night late (around 9pm) with one other person and were able to get seating immediately (though the restaurant was still quite packed).\n\nVenue / Services: a little dark inside, especially with the black walls and floor which gave the place a dimly-lit atmosphere.  Thankfully it wasn't so dark that you needed to whip out phones to read the menu.  A bit packed while we were there but not enough to feel claustrophobic (but think twice about bringing a large shopping bag or something).  The servers were pretty professional and quick at bringing food out, though we had to flag them down a few times for more water.\n\nFood: my date had been to Vietnam and upon tasting some of the dishes (especially the broths), he commented that they were pretty close to food in Vietnam.  I liked how the menu was pretty expansive so there is (usually) something for everyone.\n-- Canh Ga Chien (soy-garlic chicken wings, salt-pepper-lime dipping sauce)($9.50) - surprisingly tasty!  The skin wasn't super crunchy like you might expect from a fried chicken, but neither was it super flabby / icky.  Surprisingly wasn't too heavy in the stomach, especially after squeezing lime on top of them.  Great for sharing!\n\n-- Bun Rieu (shrimp, crab and minced pork balls, fried tofu, shrimp, tomato, chicken tomato broth)($12.50) - wanted to try something other than pho, and wasn't disappointed!  It is a bigger portion than pho bo, so be wary if you have a small stomach.  Surprisingly, the broth was very savory and yet light with the tomato in it.  The rice noodles are thicker than that in pho, so it was slightly easier to pick up (though they still tend to break apart easily).  Lot of meat in this bowl, so I doubt anyone can go hungry with this option.  \n\nMy date ordered the Pho Bo (rare beef & brisket with rice noodles in beef broth)($10.50), which was also quite tasty.  He noted its flavors were very close to what he found in Vietnam, so I'll take that as a good sign.  Very savory broth and a decent portion (not as big as the bun rieu), so seems like a solid option.  \n\nGreat spot for Vietnamese cuisine; hopefully you can experience it without dealing with a huge line like we did.  Probably would be worth 15-25 min wait time if there was one.", "author": "Audrey H."}

Though summer, it was cool and breezy out, and I was nursing the last bits of a cold -- perfect time for pho.\n\nBut before I get to my order, let me first say how nice it was to order takeout via the Yelp app. I ordered in less than a few minutes, and then it was easy to pickup roughly 20 minutes after that. Easy peasy. \n\nAnd onto the food: I opted for Pho Ga, which is poached chicken with rice noodles in ginger-chicken broth. Love love love this broth. This soup came with large pieces of white chicken -- it did not skimp in any way in that regard. I also got sprouts, scallions and some more mix-ins. \n\nAll in all, this was a delicious pho, but I do admit it is pretty basic. If you're new to pho, this will likely be right up your alley. I'm used to having a bit more in my soup, though. \n\nI also got spring rolls, which were stuffed with poached pork and shrimp, vermicelli and mint and came with a peanut dipping sauce. That peanut sauce is killer -- really a favorite. These rolls were a bit heavy on the mint, compared to other spring rolls I've had, but were pretty delicious regardless. \n\nTin also packaged up the food nicely to where I was able to get it to my hotel without any spilling and was able to assemble the soup myself to where the noodles didn't get too mushy in transit. \n\nIf you want pho, this is a good place to go!", "author": "Emily H."}

Don't order this if you can't eat meat of the bone, it's unavoidable. \n\nSoup/entrees:\n\nBo kho with egg noodles was great, the only thing I'd want is a bit more richness in the broth and some fish concentrate, but everything else about it was fantastic not too much gristle.\n\nBun bo hue was amazing too, just a smooth savory broth with the thick noodles, Vietnamese ham and flank. So enjoyable and the broth wasn't overly salty which is something that happens whenever I order bun bo hue elsewhere.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?\n\nMy group of 7 came here on a Saturday night around 7:30, and we were able to get seated pretty quickly, within 15-20 minutes or so. After perusing the menu, I went with the Canh Ga Chien ($9.50), or soy garlic wings, to start. For my entree, I ordered the Hu Tieu ($11.50), which is a noodle soup that comes with pork, chicken, and shrimp in a garlic-chicken broth.\n\nThe soy garlic wings, which came in a combination of wings and drummettes, were delicious, and my friends and I quickly gobbled them all up. \n\nI was very disappointed with my entree though. I was expecting a broth on the salty end of the spectrum, since it was described as a garlic chicken broth, but it was surprisingly sweet and not what I wanted at all. The meat was all overcooked and the chicken breast meat they used was some of the driest I've had in years, even after soaking in the broth for a while. I had a very hard time finishing this dish, but I tried hard to as I was raised to not waste food as much as possible.\n\nHonestly I think I just ordered the wrong thing, so take my review with a grain of salt. The guy next to me ordered pho bo, your standard beef-based pho, and apparently that was delicious. If I find myself in the area again, I wouldn't mind stopping by for a bowl of pho.\n\nPaid ~$30 after tax and tip.", "author": "Dianna H."}

My wife doesn't eat shrimp or pork, so this means she often has to miss out on spring rolls, but not at Tin!

Tender and not dry.\n- 5 spice chicken - the portion is generous, chicken is juicy, and flavor is good.\n\nWe typically substitute egg noodles for rice noodles.  The noodle texture is good - firm and not too soft.  The egg noodles go well with the ginger broth and all of the other fresh veggies.\n\nWe often get food to go because it's a smaller restaurant, and it gets crowded!

Further disappointment came in learning that the nearby food court at Westfield Centre was also locked up by 8:30 p.m.  Each of these disappointments though, were merely the process required to land me in the doorway of Tin around 9 p.m. and I'd gladly suffer them again if guaranteed the same outcome.\n\nTin Vietnamese Cuisine is delicious.\n\nYelp reviews serve as testimony that this place has been here for at least 8 years and that's amazing given that I'd never even heard of it.  Usually a place with legs is one about which I've heard or read something, but not Tin.  In fact, an 80% full dining room at 9 p.m. on a Monday indicates that I may be in the minority.   \n\nThe single room space is reasonably inviting with few of the authenticating touches (or kitsch) often found in Southeast Asian restaurants.  A few framed images of Vietnam line one wall but the rest of the room and the server's ethnicities reveal nothing about the menu.  \n\nThat menu focuses mainly on rolls, pho, rice plates, and bun (vermicelli noodle dishes) so between two we opted for the Tin Rolls ($10) and Bun ($10-$13).  \n\nThe Tin Rolls arrived first and were so sizable and interesting that we both admitted we could make a satisfying meal for 1 from a single order.  I'd need to look at the menu to reveal all of the ingredients in this delicious roll but I won't.  Order it and see for yourself; it's wonderful.\n\nBun fell into the same category.  One order of saut\u00e9ed lemon-grass beef bun was chock full of so many fresh and pickled herbs and vegetables that each mouthful was a riotous mix of texture and crunch.  The bun with rolled beef (stuffed with carrots and more) had the same intriguing blend of vegetables, noodles, and proteins.  I really, really liked the food here.  \n\nA common complaint of mine is dishes where the protein and vegetables are insufficient to withstand the volume of rice or noodles or...you name it, the cheap stuff.  Tin's food had no such problem.  Consuming the leftovers the morning after, I was again rewarded with the perfect balance of flavors and textures.  \n\nService at Tin was very good, with a decanter of water arriving on my table moments before I sat down.  It remained good throughout the meal, a fact I appreciated even as I found myself the sole party left inside.  \n\nNext time I'm downtown I'll know better than to lament a closed food court.

The serving size was huge and could definitely be shared. The flavour itself was not good as it was very bland and I could taste the boiled chicken which is a negative. The dish overall ever after adding the sauces etc was not good 4/10. We also got the Five spice Chicken rice plate ($10.50) 10/10 and the Chicken with dry noodles ($10.50) 7/10. A fried pancake (with calamari etc)was also ordered which was actually pretty good 7/10. \nThe winner of the evening for sure was the Five spice chicken because it was perfectly cooked with fantastic flavour and a light crispy crust. It was served with white rice and is a perfect meal.  \n\nNote: I have to rate the meal I ate (2*) but I also can not overlook the excellent dish I got  to taste hence 3.5 star for now.

The restaurant can get quite busy during peak time, but the waiters are pretty efficient and move quickly. I would not say that the service is particularly attentive, but they do get your orders quickly and get your food to you fast. I have been here several times, so here is the breakdown of the dishes that I usually get and what I would recommend. \n\nMy all time favorite dish at Tin is the Hu Tieh Kho. It is $9 and it is under the \"Other Noodles without Broth\" category. It is a noodle dish with ground pork, shrimp, and chicken, drizzled in a sweet sauce. It also comes with a cilantro-onion soup on the side that you can drink separately or add into your noodles if you wanted. This dish is the best bang for your buck and I just really like all of the different flavors in this dish. \n\nI have also had their vermicelli bowls. You can't go wrong with the Bun Ga Sa (vermicelli bowl with chicken thigh). I usually get this if I am feeling something on the lighter side, but also with a good portion of protein in it. \n\nThe chicken pho is solid here. It is nothing too special and they don't give you a generous amount of chicken in the soup. They mainly just give you a large portion of rice noodles. I would recommend you pass on the pho. \n\nIf you happen to want to get some decent food that is not too overly priced when you are planning on going to watch a movie at the Metreon or Century theater, swing by Tin to get a quick meal.

That is not to say, however, that the food here was not amazing. In all honesty, it was some of the best i've had (save for the stuff the Vietnamese part of my family normally serves up, you can't ever beat that). If you're looking for a great restaurant to impress some guests with, this is definitely the place to do it.\n\nCame as a table of 4 on a Monday night and was sat pretty quickly. Service was alright. But the food was pretty damn amazing. I got the claypot catfish and it was pretty damn close to the stuff i'm used to. I will say that maybe it was a tad darker than I'd like and had a hint too much salt. However, balanced with the AMAZING broken white rice I think this was a pretty amazing dish. The price was also pretty damn great too for a \"up scaled\" Vietnamese joint.\n\nOverall it was great, will definitely be back whenever im in SF again to try more of their dishes.

We came, seated, waited, and left. \n\nI came here with two friends on a Thursday afternoon and was seated right away. There were even a few tables open. After perusing the menu for 10 minutes we were ready to order (we took longer to look at the menu to give the staff more time before taking our order). \n\nIt seemed like no one was coming to take our orders so we flagged down the man who seated us. He told us to wait for the waiters to take our order (even though this man was also serving other tables and doing wait staff duties). \n\nSo we waited, another 10 minutes go by. We try to flag down either of the two other wait staff. Hands up, flailing, eye contact, the works. We are at the table in the middle too so they all walked around us to get to other tables. \n\nThe wait staff would just walk by with their eyes forward and ignore us. Would have been decent just to acknowledge that you saw us but tell us you'll be back in x amount of time. Nope, just eyes forward and pretend you don't see us. \n\nSo we wait another 10 minutes while the staff pretended we weren't there. That's when we left. I'm honestly not sure if they even noticed. \n\nWasted over 30 minutes sitting in here trying to place an order. I'm usually more forgiving if places are packed and service is slow or food comes out slow. But we couldn't even get our orders in. \n\nHope your have better luck getting food here.

I came with a couple of friends that I'd just gone to Vietnam with a few months ago, so you know it's good if we think it's on par with the food in Vietnam =). \n\nCame around 7pm on a Wednesday and there were plenty of tables available. We started with an order of the Tin Rolls, which are Tin's take on summer rolls. So good!! These are somehow both light and refreshing and also really satisfying and filling. These had a nice crunch with each bite from the grilled lemongrass pork and fried shallots. \n\nNext we had the lotus shoot salad, a perfect blend of crunchy, sweet, and tangy with all the flavors blending seamlessly. \n\nOur two entrees were the lemongrass chicken with vermicelli and the claypot catfish, and we also got a side of the sauteed bok choy with garlic sauce. The chicken was so tender and moist! The only nitpick there was that the dish got a little soggy on the bottom so the noodles at the end were a little over-saturated with the sauce. The catfish was perfectly cooked and flaky, only complaint was that the dish was a little smaller than expected with probably only around 6 pieces of fish. Bok choy did it's job, tasty but wasn't particularly memorable.\n\nOverall, prices seemed reasonable to me considering the quality of the ingredients and the mostly generous portions.

It was on the small side, but the flavour compensated for it.\n\nFast forward to my most recent visit. I couldn't believe the portion size shrank even more, when it was already small to begin with. Not to mention the price hiked up. It felt I was eating a kid-sized portion of pho. I was fine with the smaller-than-usual portion size before, but this was just ridiculous. You will not leave here feeling full, unless you order their $10 spring rolls to fill yourself up.\n\nI sadly can't recommend this place anymore.

My friend got the dry bowl of noodles with soup on the side which prevents the noodles from getting soggy and it was super yummy! The Chicken Pho was great too. Some people complained about the portion size but honestly, I thought it was perfectly fine and greater than that other Saigon restaurant kind of around the same area. Quality over quantity guys, the quantity difference was honestly negligible. Someone also got a rice dish (non-noodles) and it was delicious so it's always nice to see that they're good at different dishes and not just noodles.

Believe me when I say it's the best as I've been on a quest to find the best bun rieu in SF, since nothing has compared to the ones in San Jose (a.k.a. best Vietnamese food central). Flavor and authenticity is there, not skimpy on the fix-ins and flavor is delicious (Tofu, crab meatball, fancy pork, and tomatoes).\n- Currently this place is on my weekly rotation and I'm constantly craving either one of the dishes I mentioned above to order. \n- Cha gio (egg rolls): it's a mini dish in one with dry noodles, lettuce, herbs, and fish sauce. It's the meat and the crispy outter layer that makes or breaks this dish and this one has it all. \n- Shaken beef: Reminds of comfort food with the cubes of beef, bell peppers, and perfectly cooked onions. The salt, peper, and lemon dipping sauce is a perfect accompaniment with a bite of warm steamed white rice. Yum!\n- Chicken noodle soup: they add minced ginger into the broth, so there is a little kick and it definitely hits the spot during a cold day. \n\nImprovements\n- Not a good spot for big groups, but with a small party of max 4, it's a great option. \n- I'm all about ordering ahead or delivery when possible for efficiency, but picking up To Go orders was pretty much the opposite where I stood around not being acknowledged by the server handling orders and I realized after a while that there was a bag with my name on a shelf behind another patron waiting around for his order. \n\nTips\n- I've been several times to dine in during weekdays in the evening and on weekends, never a wait and immediately seated. \n- Order ahead for pick-up through the Yelp app OR delivery through Caviar! \n- Parking is street metered parking, but not too hard to find since it's further out beyond the shopping area in SOMA.", "author": "Tracy T."}

I first discovered them while walking by several years ago, but I didn't think much of them.  Not for any reason on their end, just that with so many great Vietnamese places near me, I never had any urgency to look into them.  Clearly I should have though because this unassuming spot that I had so easily forgotten about is pretty awesome!\n\nAfter recently seeing a bunch of Yelp friends check into Tin, I finally decided I had to check them out.  The place looked a lot like what I remember, but far busier; during our entire meal, there was a steady line of people waiting for a table.  Partly because the place isn't huge, but mostly because they're just that popular!  It's not hard to see why though - the menu offers so many legit and enticing options, my friend and I were torn on what to get!  Papaya Salad?  Banh Xeo?  Maybe the Bun Rieu or Bun Bo Hue people have raved about??

Between all of the different ingredients, the filling has a nice mix of flavors and textures.  That, combined with the rice wrap they use (which is thinner and crisps up better than most) makes for one tasty fried treat!\n\n-- PHO BO - Rare Eye-of-Round, Brisket, Rice Noodles, Beef Broth...$9.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/t%C3%ADn-vietnamese-cuisine-san-francisco-3?select=W458QtOLgsYj_QdDOLj3MA)\nWhile I wish there were more combinations to choose from (though you can add tripe, beef balls, or tendon for $1.50 each), this was pretty damn good.  The broth was well balanced and had just the right amount of richness to it.  What's more, the noodles were cooked perfectly and both cuts of beef were great (I especially liked that the eye-of-round was rare).  The one knock was that the portion felt a bit light compared to divey pho joints.\n\nBeyond how the pho felt a little pricey, everything else about Tin was great.  The service was friendly and prompt despite how busy they were and I loved how much the menu had to offer.  Considering how close they are to my friend's place, I'm sure I'll be back sooner rather than late even if they aren't going to replace any of my usual favorites.

I understand it's busy dinner time, but how could she being rude to push us out? I didn't think this is a good restaurant should be!\n\nMore to say about service!!! We ordered Tin rolls and two phos, when we received the check, we were kinda surprised. As you can see on the receipt, it charged something called \"SF employer mandates\", it was my first to see that on a receipt so I asked the female server what that was. She brought the Manuel to me and pointed to these tiny statements below. It said if you ordered food over $10, you need to pay \"SF employer mandates\"! Gee, almost anything on the Manuel is over $10 which means you have to pay \"SF employer mandate\" anyway. For my own understanding, that's like tips, but mandatory tips!!

Well, I wasn't wearing socks, but you know what I mean. \n\nThe service was great for how fast we had to get in and get out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "I've been to Tin at least five times and here are a couple of things you need to know:\n\n-The food is not completely authentic Vietnamese. I should have known better since most of the customers and staff are not Vietnamese. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but if I consistently don't see a lot of Vietnamese people (or Asians, in general), it's sort of a red flag for me. I like their bun bo hue, but I'm not a huge fan of their pho bo. I know some of my non-Vietnamese friends like their pho though, so maybe you'll like it. Finally, avoid their Vietnamese iced coffee. On all the occasions I've tried it, I've been disappointed.\n\n-You pay quite a bit of money for small portions.\n\n-Service is ..not good. I cannot emphasize this enough! Literally every time I go there, service is slow or I get sassy waiters or some other mistake. Here are some of my experiences:\n\n-Once, I went with a group of friends. All of us wanted pho except for me (I wanted bun bo hue), but one friend wanted substitution for a different noodle for his pho. So I told the waitress (she has short hair, tattoos, not Viet, for reference), four regular pho bo, another pho with larger vermicelli noodle, and one bun bo hue for me. The waitress audibly sighed, shook her head, and told me, \"No. Everyone tells me their order one by one.\" I've never had a problem ordering food like that in a Vietnamese restaurant, but she explained that she needed everyone to order individually so she knew which food went where. Okay, fine. No problem. However, did she really have to be so rude when she told me that? Nope. Anyways, food came out, and guess what? She put the bowls in the wrong order. Bravo \n\n-I took two friends to try bun bo hue because they had never had it before. Both of them don't handle spicy foods well, so we asked the waitress (same person who sassed me in the first story) to make 2 of the bun bo hues less spicy. She insisted that it tastes better spicy (which I agree with), but my friends requested again to make it not spicy. When the bun bo hue finally came out, all three bowls were the same level of spiciness (I tasted all of them). So basically, waitress or the chef disregarded the request. That wasn't a huge issue because they just drank a bunch of water. However, my friend was missing all of the beef shank from her bowl and so we had to ask the waitress to get some from the kitchen (I'm grateful that the waitress was efficient about this and apologized). Finally, I found hair in my bun bo hue....lovely.\n\n-More recently, (and this incident was probably the worst) I was craving hu tieu kho, but I noticed that in the menu, it's listed under the section called \"Other Noodles without Broth.\" Here's the description: \"Hu Tieu Kho / xa-xiu and ground pork, chicken, shrimp, rice noodles, soy-tomato sauce.\" Usually, hu tieu kho comes with broth on the side, but there was no mention of it on the menu. I was pretty confused, so I decided to just order their normal hu tieu with a request to put the broth on the side. When it was finally time to order, the waiter (not Viet) said, \"So you mean hu tieu kho.\" I told him that, yes, I saw that, but there was no description for broth on the side. He kept insisting that I get hu tieu kho because there is broth. So I asked, \"Are you sure?\" I was going to continue on about why I was confused because of the section it was under when he interrupted me by PLACING HIS HAND ON MY ARM and said, \"Honey, I've been working here for 8 years\" and something along the lines of how he knew the menu, etc. etc. \n\nFirst of all, NEVER touch a customer without their permission. I am NOT your friend or your \"honey.\" Second of all, all he had to say was, \"Yes, it's under that section of the menu and the description doesn't say it has broth on the side, but it does.\" He talked to me in such a condescending tone for almost the entirety of that ordering process, and honestly, I was at a loss for words that I just went ahead and ordered the hu tieu kho. Yes, it did come with the broth on the side, so he was right. I just wish he told me that in a nicer way. Yes, I respect that you worked at the restaurant for 8 years, you probably do know your Vietnamese food well. However, I've been Vietnamese-American for all my life and to see a menu description like that definitely threw me off. All I needed was a polite clarification and it would have been fine. In the end, the hu tieu kho was decent, but definitely not the best I've ever had. Side note, he totally forgot about my friend's iced coffee until we reminded him - my friend is also Vietnamese and he wasn't impressed by the quality.\n\nI used to come to Tin despite bad service because I missed food from home. However, coming to Tin just makes me feel like my own culture is rejecting me. The latest experience was definitely the last straw, so I will not be going back again. It's not worth paying that much money for mediocre Vietnamese food, a nice interior, and continuously bad service.", "author": "Trisha V."}

I remember finding Tin's on a late Thursday night after being at the mall for too many hours and needing pho real badly. We were hungry, looking for a good place to eat that was close by, for a good price. And we found Tin's :') \n\nTin's is a smaller venue, and gets pretty busy around dinner time. The first time I came here, we had to wait in line to put our name down (yes!) but that's to be expected. If it's super busy, expect to wait 40+ minutes for a table. \n\nI've gotten their Bun Bo Hue, Pho Bo, Tin Rolls, and the Cha Gio. \n\nBun Bo Hue\nGood but pretty spicy, especially for someone who has a decent spice tolerance. Technically not as authentic as it could me (no blood in it) but for people who aren't used to or familiar with that, this is the safer route. If you have average spice tolerance, I'd recommend asking them to make it a bit more mild!\n\nPho Bo\nThe Pho Bo is pretty good. Just your Pho with beef in it, and you can add extra meat to it (meatballs, tendon, etc.) for an extra $1.50. It was pretty good -- I've had better pho elsewhere, but this place is still one of my go-to's for good pho.\n\nTin Rolls\nWasn't quite sure what this was to begin with, but we got it because it sounded delicious and was first on the menu. The meat was seasoned wonderfully and the dipping sauce that goes with it is SO good. So good. There was something crispy in the roll that gave it extra texture which was nice, but the hardboiled egg didn't seem to go well with the roll. If they took that out, this roll would be 100% spot on.\n\nCha Gio\nI think about the Cha Gio often. Crispy, delicious goodness. Just go for it. Don't even ask what's in it. Maybe one of the favorite foods I've consumed in my life. Do this for me.\n\nTin's is great -- I recommend this place all the time to friends who visit from out of town, and they all love Tin's too :-)", "author": "Christine Y."}

Man did I make the right choice! The serving size was very generous (I got a huge bowl with a surprisingly large amount of meat). Had I not skipped lunch that day, the bowl would have definitely filled me up. The pork was prepared very well, crisp flavorful slices but not dried out. The sauce for you to pour over the noodles has a nice tangy flavor, and all the vegetables were very fresh. My only complaint is the excessive amount of bean sprouts that I found at the bottom of my bowl. I would have preferred there to be more noodles instead of so many bean sprouts.\n\nReally solid restaurant! My order was $9.50 + tax/tip whatever.

The service was fast, and expedient, though when crowds grew - it took us a long time to get the check.\n\nWe had the Mango Salad, Chicken Wings, and Banh Mi (Chicken & Pork).\n\nThe Mango Salad was probably our favorite dish. It was crisp, fresh, just the right amount of sweet to spicy. It was not overdressed (as it often is at other places), We ate it up quick! The shrimp in the salad was good. It came with pork belly as well, though the flavor and pieces got lost among the green mango. My only criticism would be to do pork belly OR shrimp, so that you can taste your choice integrated with the salad (rather than lost in it). Overall though, we would order this again. It was a great appetizer!\n\nThe Chicken Wings were cooked well and were very tender. However, the flavor fell flat and the wings were not impressive. They had this generic, ubiquitous flavor, as though these wings could have been ordered at any restaurant. They weren't special, nor were they worth the stomach space! Would not order again. We'd encourage the restaurant to add a flavorful side-sauce, or to spice things up a bit.\n\nThe Banh Mi (we ordered 2, one with chicken and one with pork). Overall, we would rate the pork over the chicken. Banh Mi can usually be broken down by the quality of the bread, meat, and condiments. The bread here was fantastic. It was crusty, crispy, and added a nice crunch to the sandwich. Yet, at the same time, the inside was soft and provided good support for the fillings. Check plus! The meat was good, though it was tough to taste the flavor of the marinade, and further the meat was a bit chewy. Check minus! Lastly, the condiments were perfect. They combination of cilantro, mayo,  and other pickled veggies added additional crunch and an earthy / herby flavor to help break down the meat. Overall, would likely not order again.\n\nWe'd honestly give this place a 3.5 stars. The service was good and the food was also pretty good. We felt that we didn't order the right stuff. We do plan to go again, but will probably stick to the noodle / noodles & broth dishes, instead. We'd recommend folks do the same. You can get better Banh Mi elsewhere in the city.", "author": "Aditya Y."}

Yes! Is it high quality? Yes! Is it the best pho in the city? No. It is also a bit smaller in serving size than other pho places.\nI'd say for the area and being a bit of a fancier Vietnamese restaurant the pho is indeed quite stellar. But.. you know the best pho places have to have a number in their restaurant name, or have a quirky name (shout out to Yummy Yummy), or have servers serve pho with their thumb in the soup for that extra flavor.\nI've also had their Pho Ga, a chicken ginger broth, which didn't excite my taste buds but it would be a great \"chicken noodle soup\" substitute for those kind of days. Their 5 spice chicken over rice is also done really well with flavorful and juicy chicken.\nSpring rolls, can't go wrong, and their Hue Rolls... such an amazing flavor mix and texture mix of the summer roll wrap with the spring roll crunch.\nThe Tin rolls were delicious but a bit off for me since it was quite \"heavy\" not too much of an appetizer feel.\nOverall you won't be disappointed dining here.", "author": "Eden W."}

This time, I got the vegetarian bun--grilled lemongrass tofu, shiitake mushrooms, and soy vinaigrette which I think was even better than the bahn xeo. The shiitake mushrooms were caramelized to perfection. The bun had incredible texture throughout from the soft noodles to the julienned cucumber, lettuce, bean sprouts, pickled daikon and carrots, and peanuts. I also highly recommend to top it with the crisp-fried cha gia roll. The price point was a little high but the bowl is huge. Met a friend here who I hadn't seen in while and the location was midway between our offices. The place is small and does get a little noisy.

Not sure why, but every time we would wave down our waiter to order/pay the bill/get more water, he wouldn't come. Sometimes he would acknowledge that we waved him down, nod at us, and then proceed to help other tables and then hide out in the kitchen. Other times, he would purposefully look the other way. The restaurant was fairly packed that night, but I don't think that should have compelled the waiter to act this way. Definitely bizarre and I'm left unimpressed.\n\nFood is okay but as some other people have mentioned, it is not authentic.

The other dishes aren't bad, though many of the servers aren't well versed to Vietnamese dishes so they often don't understand my inquiries of the ingredients that go into the dish.\n\nStill a solid place for lunch though!

Besides that, Tin has the same friendly service, reasonable prices, and great food. \n\nMy favorites:\n* Five Spice Chicken - my go-to dish if I'm not in a noodle/soup mood. The chicken has a crispy skin and is super tender and juicy! I usually never order chicken dishes at restaurants, but this is one of my faves. \n* Lotus root salad - always fresh and delicious. Love the pork.\n* Bun Bo Hue - I'm usually pretty picky about bun bo hue, but I really liked Tin's version. It's not as authentic, but definitely very flavorful and spicy. The broth is delicious and portions are large with a good meat-to-noodle ratio. Sometimes, the meat is a bit too chewy and overcooked, but overall really good.\n* Pho - good, but not extraordinary\n\nGreat spot in SOMA, but I'll stick with Mau from now on.", "author": "Vivian H."}

It's not too crowded around dinnertime, so it's a great place to meet someone after work for a reasonably-priced dinner near downtown.\n\nThe menu is pretty standard as far as Vietnamese goes, with pho options, rice plate options, and dry noodle options, though the menu design is notably more minimalist than typical Vietnamese restaurants. In particular, I really like the five-spice chicken rice plate (Add a fried egg!). The chicken skin is crispy while the meat is tender and juicy, and the flavors are awesome and well-balanced. They're also pretty generous with the portions so you should be pretty satisfied with your meal.\n\nThe staff is friendly and fun, though no one seems to be actually Vietnamese. Interestingly, this makes the place seem a little \"less authentic\" (though it could just be perception).\n\nIn general, this place is a little higher-end than your regular Vietnamese place, without being fancy or expensive, and manages to be just as delicious!", "author": "Brittany C."}

There were only a few seats left on a Fri night and after we were seated, a line started forming outside the restaurant. The location is a few blocks south of Market St. Given the popularity, I had really high hopes.\n\nWe ordered spring rolls, pho bo, catfish claypot and a tea. \n\nFirst up were the spring rolls. They were good but not as flavorful as our usual pho spot, Mau. Seemed like a lot of noodles and not much else. \n\nMy pho bo was good, but later that evening, I was extremely thirsty, usually a sign of excess salt or MSG :( My bf's catfish claypot was also good but shortly afterwards, we noticed that the claypot wasn't hot which made us wonder was the catfish actually cooked in the claypot??  Usually claypot dishes are piping hot and the server's always warning you to be extremely careful. \n\nIt was beginning to be a pretty busy evening and we still hadn't received our tea by the time we were done. Our server realized this and brought us the tea for free of charge, which was a nice gesture. \n\nThe restaurant is very reasonably priced (~$30 for dinner for 2) and in a convenient location.

To my delight, their veggie pho was amazing! If their vegetable broth is any indication of the richness of the beef broth, then I must come again! The vegetable pho had an intense vegetable flavor, and it was filled with a variety of ingredients -- carrots, mushrooms, broccoli (this was the best in the bowl!). Oh, and may I add that in addition to the fresh basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts, and lime served with the pho, they also give you pickled red onion! What a nice addition!\n\nNothing too special about the shrimp spring rolls (normally made with pork & shrimp), but their sauce is slightly different than traditional peanut sauces. I couldn't quite get my taste buds around the unique flavor so you're going to have to try it for yourself instead. \n\nThe only negatives -- \nMy friend and I were seated at a 4-top table, and then asked to move when more guests came in - understandable, but annoying. \nThey only had two wait staff for the dinner rush; they needed a third.\n\nI shall return!", "author": "Erin G."}

The beef balls were juicy and yummy. You can also tell it's a legit Vietnamese place when it comes with a large bundle of raw bean sprouts and mint leaves! \n\nI was also pleasantly surprised at the spinach & ground pork add-on for like $4-- which I ordered on a whim after assessing the pathetic amount of veggies I've been eating. It was legit!! The spinach was fresh and sweet and generous, and the soup was sweet and tasty without being overly salty or tasting of MSG.", "author": "Jia L."}

Would you like your order to be taken after you have had ten minutes staring at the menu?  I know I sure do.  However, this place fails in all aspects, and should be disregarded if you have any standards.  Tin is quite possibly the most horrible Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to.  From the bad service to the equally bad food, I cannot tell you which is worse.  \n\nThe GF and I came at 9:15 pm on a Saturday.  There was no worker at the small check-in counter.  We waited for about a minute for someone to approach us, and we were seated at the most dim-lit table, closest to the kitchen.  Normally, figuring out what to order takes such a long time with the GF because she has to check yelp for reviews and photos.  Yet, she did all of this, and still no one would take our order.  If we did not finally manage to flag down someone, we would have never placed our order, and never had food (which, looking back, would not have been a bad thing).  \n\nWe decided to order the pho ga and the five spice chicken rice plate.  The food took quite a bit of time to make its way to our table.  However, this was understandable because it had gotten busy since we arrived. \n\nThe pho looked good.  Surprisingly, the ginger broth tasted even better than I thought it would.  The chicken was the only thing wrong with this dish.  The broth could not mask the failure of what could have been a winning dish.  The chicken was extremely dry, to say the least.  .  To paint a picture, imagine taking a few squares of toilet paper from a roll.  Wet the paper with luke-warm water.  Then, squeeze the excess water out.  Now place the paper in your mouth and chew. \n\nThe five spice chicken was equally disappointing.  We added an egg to the dish, which allowed the yolk to make the chicken less dry.  It helped, but could not save the dish.  Hot sauce was needed to downplay the dryness as well.  Some of the chicken was overcooked leading to burnt skin.  \n\nEverything in a dining experience that could go wrong, did. \n\nOn a side note, as we were halfway done eating, a customer walks past our table to make his way to the restroom.  However, he loses balance over the clearly wet, slippery floor.  He just barely escapes from falling and/or breaking his ankle.  I am almost certain no one working seemed to care about the well-being of the man.  Quickly, they ran to get a wet floor sign.  Something tells me, this was just to limit liabilities on their end, should an accident happen.  Otherwise, they would have already had the sign up, knowing that the floor was wet.  \n\nI will pass on Tin. You should too.  There are way better options.", "author": "Victor L."}

Oh, ok, I'll just have pho ga.\" Oops, please excuse my bad manner for eavesdropping on a question my neighboring table patron was asking the waiter. I should have known, Tin definitely caters Vietnamese flavor to a certain genre here. \n\nThe ambiance would have also been a wonderful clue to the kind of Vietnamese food being served here, everyone seems to be yelling over each other for a conversation, all the while, loud top 40's play in the background, hmm this definitely reminded me of being in a dive bar or some sad nightclub. Nope, we're just at Tin Vietnamese Cuisine.\n\nThe pho ga is definitely quite bland and the Bun Rue, totally thin and without much of a soul to that supposedly rich \"chicken tomato\" broth. All the great flavor of garlic, onion, cilantro, are all absent from the food I've tasted here at Tin's. It felt like all the \"acquired flavors\" are erased and toned down to appease a certain crowd here, and when I look around, this totally makes sense. Tin Vietnamese Cuisine is basically the Osha Thai of Vietnamese restaurants.  \n\nI do however like the fresh spring roll, they definitely did quite well on this one. I will definitely come back just for the fresh spring roll but not the pho, nor the confusing night-club like ambiance.", "author": "Taffany H."}

But damn, I'd rather stick to what I know than come back here again.\n\nWhat I know with Asian joints is you come for the food, not the service.  They're quick, efficient, direct and do the job:  they feed you.  But your place was NOT at all quick (though they ran around a lot for no apparent reason) or efficient and the only direction I got was where the bathroom was.   We get that you're a small place so if it's busy and we have a party of 6, obviously there'd be a wait.  But...don't say 15-minutes when you really mean 50!  And...don't make it seem like you're doing us any extra favors since we gave you a shot and actually waited.  \n\nWe couldn't make any changes (no matter how slight) to our order, we barely got any water and our server acted like we should be serving them.

A total of 2 Stars, however, because a 2-Star review would mean \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" in Yelp lingo, while a 3-Star review would mean \"A-OK.\", and while I think 2-Stars is a bit harsh, I can't rate my review 3 Stars because no, my experience was not \"A-OK.\" \n\nI've been here at least a dozen times, and while I get that the service is pretty terrible, I keep coming back because the food is so good.\n\nSo earlier tonight, while at work, I decided to use EAT24 to order food for myself and a few coworkers, and I walked the 15 minutes or so [one-way] to pick up the order. Yes, it is far considering the abundance of food options in the area I work in, but I was more than willing to walk since the food is so good, and my coworkers were enthusiastic in trying it out.\n\nI was quoted about 30 minutes, and it was ready right as I got there and I was out the door in about a minute. Nice. I walk the 15-minute walk back to work, only to discover that one order was missing. I call Tin and right away the man over the phone said yes, they do have it. Okay, great. It's a 30-minute round-trip, and now I need to repeat that trip, so about an hour of walking total.\n\nI finally get there, the man recognizes me, and hands me the food. He says: \"sorry about that\", and walks away to attend to more orders, because it was really busy (Saturday night, 7:30pm). I stood there, waiting for him to come back, because I was hoping they'd make it up to me somehow. Yes, the man didn't know that I had to walk as far as I had to in order to come here. Yes, I could've waited longer and remain in the way for servers coming and going from the kitchen, for him to notice me and ask me if something was wrong. I left because I had to get back to work ASAP (since I was no longer on my break), and because I felt like he wouldn't do anything anyway. So I left, feeling defeated.\n\nWhile I will return in the future, I won't go out of my way like I did tonight to come here. I never had any expectations for the service here, or lack thereof, and thought that my low expectations would shield me from disappointment, but I was mistaken.\n\nTin, if something like this happens to another customer of yours, please try to make it right. There are times when merely correcting your mistake is not enough; sometimes, more is needed. You should not have to wait for customers to complain to you for you to make something right. In my case, you were clearly in the wrong (could you have called me instead of waiting for me to call you, perhaps saving me time and frustration? Because as soon as I called, the man immediately acknowledged that they do have it--he didn't even have to look for it), so there's no reason for you to not try to make it up to me, like maybe throw in a Vietnamese-style iced-coffee? Something. Anything. I'm easy to please.\n\nOr maybe you guys know people like me will always come back because your food is so damn good? Ugh. Clever Tin...", "author": "Bobby M."}

It was a Tuesday and there was plenty of parking within the block on Howard street. ***side note: after our meal we returned to our car to find the back window was smashed in. Just something to be aware of when parking in this area!!**** (Update: after looking at other reviews, it looks like other people have had the same problem with their cars being broken into on this street. I'd highly recommend taking public transportation when coming here!! Not worth the hassle of replacing a window)\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is cute and is lit with a nice ambiance. They had a good mix of music playing, somewhat loudly. Once I looked at the menu, I could pick out about 4 vegetarian items easily (which is a pretty big deal to me, considering I usually struggle finding a Vietnamese joint with veggie options in the heart of SF). My only complaint on this matter is that it would have been helpful if they had a vegetarian section so that I didn't have to dig through all of the menu to figure out my options... \n\nThe items I tried were: the Papaya Salad (veggie version), Firecracker shrimp, Vegetarian Pho and Vegetarian Bun. \n\n-The Papaya Salad was so good, even the meat eaters at the table were loving it. The sauce could have been a little spicier, but it had a good amount of tamarind flavor to it as well, which I loved! Lots of chiffonade-d basil and peanutty goodness too. I found myself drinking spoonfuls of the sauce leftover after we finished the salad. I would definitely order this again and have it as a meal to myself :) It was my favorite item and I give it 5 stars *****\n\n-The Firecracker Shrimp were alright. I don't really care for shrimp much these days, but the dipping sauce flavor and crispiness of the wrappers were yummy. They were cooked well and tasted good, but I probably wouldn't order again. 4 stars ****\n\n-The Vegetarian Pho was light and delicious. We took half to-go and finished it the next day and it still tasted great. I feel that it could have had more veggies going on though, to give it more substance. The broth could have been more flavorful, but we usually add a ton of lime, Hoisin and Sriracha anyway. Tasted like maybe it was broth from a box... I would order this again though because it was good! 4 stars ****\n\n-The Vegetarian Bun was pretty good as well. It was my first time trying vermicelli, or any noodles without broth. There was delicious tofu (so so good and flavorful), mushrooms, lettuce, basil, and a few other pieces of veggies, as well as a small dish of sauce to pour over. I found myself wishing there was more of the sauce, as the flavors didn't seem to coat all of the contents of the bowl. I took my leftovers home and it was actually better the following day, in my opinion, after it marinated in the fridge overnight. All the flavors really meshed together. I'd probably order it again sometime, and I give this dish 4 stars ****", "author": "Jeni S."}

Growing up eating pho 12 months out of the year, I had the urge to seek out some delicious Vietnamese cuisine.  Tin had some reviews and pictures so I ended up making my way to Howard Street for pho.  Tin is pretty close to the Metreon and Yerba Buena Gardens so if you're in this area and want Viet food, come to Tin!\n\nAt first, it looked like Tin was closed because they don't have the crazy, flashy, neon signs that a lot of Asian restaurants gravitate towards.  I noticed the clean and simple decor and thought \"Wow, this is one fancy and non-sticky Viet place!\"  The menu was simple and not clustered like many Viet places.  Downside was that they didn't have pictures.  I ordered the pho with beef balls ($8.50) and a plate of chicken wings ($8).  My partner-in-crime ordered the Hu Tieu ($.8.50), which came with a variety of meat and shrimp (loved the broth).  Our soy-garlic chicken wings were nice and crispy on the outside, but moist and juicy on the inside.  When you first look at them, they may seem overcooked, but they really aren't.  SO GOOD.\n\nOne thing that made me scratch my head a little was why the option of adding beef balls to my pho cost me an extra $1.  They really only give you two whole beef balls cut into halves (so that it looks like you got 4 beef balls). *EDIT*  People!  I am talking about meat balls here, not testicles hahah!

The highlights for us were the rich, deep flavors of the broth in the Pho Bo, the flavor balance of the pork in the Bun Thik Nuong, and the fresh limeade to drink.  Fairly inexpensive as well, two entrees plus two drinks for $25 +tax/tip.\n\nA downside is that the restaurant is on the noisier side -- because it was completely full with a waiting list at 8pm -- so it was a bit chaotic to have a conversation at times.", "author": "Jason S."}

The app to main course timing couldn't have been better.  I hate when I go somewhere, order a starter and it basically comes at the same time as the meal. News flash, not a starter. That is not the case here. The beef in my Pho was so nice and thin, and I don't know if this is the case with all Pho places but the onions, bean sprouts etc came as a side to add at your own discretion.  Loved that.

The beef was not very pleasant and salty, not sure what it was we ate but the pork was very good and I would recommend at least the meat portion of it.

I usually add lots of hoisin sauce, but it wasn't even needed as it would've become too salty. The accompanying plate of toppings had some bean sports, lime, and....basil?

The predominant Asian community is Chinese. I was fully expecting a wonderful display and a broad authentic menu. It's about half the options I was expecting and a little more gourmet than most.\n\nSpring rolls were large and rolled nice and tight plenty of pork flavor, but the shrimp was there, but I barely tasted it. The peanut dipping sauce was extra sweet, very little fish sauce.\n\nThe pho broth was excellent the noodles were a little less than proportionate to the size of the bowl, but the rare steak was really good and probably the best brisket I've ever had. Intramuscular fat, sliced to perfection. Not quite fall apart. No tripe, no flank, no tendon, no meatballs. A very watered down version for more public consumption. A nice size somewhere between a regular small and large. \n\nLemongrass pork is tender, well marinated and crisp notes of the fresh herbs used were a winner winner. A little light on the rice and the usual cucumber and tomato garnishment. \n\nDo not add grilled shrimp to an order. It's $2 for 3 medium shrimp probably U-25 sized. Vermicelli is perfect . Fish dipping sauce was thick and not very pungent. I would have liked to see true broken rice dishes. \n\nThey have quite a few drink options, but none of the super traditional kinds. \n\nOn a busy Saturday night the wait wasn't very long, but the service wasn't up to par. Server was not friendly, probably stressed out, our waters and tea were not refilled and they took some of our dishes a little early despite asking if we were done. Definitely in a hurry to move along another party. I like the d\u00e9cor as it's more modern and not so traditional, no fish tank. TV's in the corners are not distracting.", "author": "Walter M."}

The veggie bun is my favorite dish, and I'm a seasoned meat eater. It's the perfect mid-day lunch and just tastes so clean and fresh, as do all their dishes that I've tried.\n\nThe service can be a bit haphazard, especially during lunch, but it's always so hospitable and charming. I hope the influx allows another wait staff to be hired; sometimes there is only one person during lunch and it gets hectic. The dimly lit and chic interior helps you relax, as does their wine and beer offerings-check the chalkboard for the former and ask the server for the latter.\n\nSo the Duchess grants you permission to come in, and if you don't soon she'll grab you by the hair of your tinny tin tin.", "author": "Joanna M."}

Well....\n\nWe ordered the banh xeo, pho bo, bun bo hue and bun cha ha noi. \n\nThe banh xeo was a bit too oily and bland in my opinion. The crepe wasn't very crispy and just didn't come out right. At least the lettuce and herbs were fresh. \n\nThe bun bo hue (bbh) had the right spice level, but the broth lacked the complex flavor that it should have. No pig feet or pork blood? I get it that some don't like it, but when I'm ordering and the server doesn't ask me if it's ok, then I'm gonna assume it's included. Maybe the place is targeted to more 'americanized' tastebuds? I hope not....  the plus is that they did serve it with cabbage on the side. Most places don't and I'm glad they got that part right. \n\nThe bun cha hanoi was a pretty large portion and the veggies were fresh along with the noodles. The pork patties were a good size and had ok flavor but it was pretty salty. \n\nI can't comment on the pho bo since I didn't get to try it, but that's probably a good thing...considering the other dishes. \n\nTotal bill with tip came out to near $50....for Vietnamese food\n\nLook, everyone has an opinion on viet food and will always compare it to their favorite spot but unfortunately this didn't make the grade for me.

In a sentence,  it just wasn't a good experience for me overall.\n\nFunny thing is that I actually suggested this restaurant to my friends.  Perhaps I always came either for dinner or during the weekend.  For lunch time during the week, this place would be A ZOO!\n\nWe knew it was going to be busy.  We planned to arrive even before the restaurant was open.  We were the 2nd group or 3rd group of people to arrive - or I should say 3 of us arrived first, and the 4th person was on the way.  And people (customers) weren't really lining up.  We were just standing outside the door chatting.  \n\nI'm setting this up to describe the next thing that happened: when the door opend, we went in.  We informed that there were going to be the 4 of us, and our friend would be arriving in a few minutes.  (My firned texted me to say he had already parked and on his way.)  But the matradee/bus boy WAS RELUCTANT TO SEAT US!  And worse thing is that, he just sounded like he had an attitude, \" you know we're going to be full.\"  This is when there were only THREE groups of customers sitting down!  90 percent of the restaurant were still EMPTY at that time. (The other two groups were just parties of two's.)  And there was still half an hour before the noon time.  Eventually he did let us sit down.  And fortunately our friend did arrive shortly after.  So we felt we were not \"wasting\" their bigger table.\n\nAnd that attitude did not stop.  Later on, when I was eating, he asked me to scoot the chair further inside.  I understand he had a point.  They were busy, and the path behind me needed to be cleared.  But the tone WAS CLEARLY IMPOLITE.  I felt like I was being reprimanded.  And I felt that he did that to me on purpose.\n\nI think at this point, it was pretty much very hard for me to enjoy my meal.  I just don't need to be in a restaurant to feel like I need to put up with attitudes.  \n\nThere WERE, two factors that were the saving grace for me to not to give my experience as a one-star.  One was that our waitress was wonderful!  She was polite and attentive.  The other was that the food I had was good -- which of course, was the main reason that I suggested this place to my friends, that they have good food.  My friends also said they liked their food.\n\nIf you think that 2-star is too harsh for the attitude, then l would elaborate why I said this place was a zoo during our visit.  Well, now that I've said it, \"zoo\" wasn't a good analogy.  Because zoo was more quiet.  The space was just too small, too packed.  Customers sit so close to each other.  So in order to hear they own conversation, they were essentially doing shouting matches!  It was SO LOUD, I couldn't concentrate on enjoying my food. \n\nI would not go back, left alone recommending this place to anybody.", "author": "Charlie Y."}

I live extremely close to Tin and have been eating here for well over 3 years (in the restaurant or via takeout/delivery). Some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had and, hands down, the best pho in SF (yes, even better than Miss Saigon, which I've previously reviewed). Clean, fresh ingredients and vibrant flavors on every dish. Pho Bo is my favorite (with extra broth...yum!); also, the Hu Tieu (delicious garlic-y chicken broth). You can't go wrong with the vermicelli noodle bowls either. A side of Sauteed Baby Bok Choy is always a must along with the Hue Rolls. Just try everything on the menu. It's all spectacular :)", "author": "Amy G."}

They even removed the item from our tab to compensate for the mixup. Now THAT is great service! \n\nGive the lemongrass pork and pho bo a try! Good stuff.", "author": "Tiffany W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-25", "description": "There is a high correlation between poor restaurant hygiene and quality Vietnamese food, but Tin proves that correlation does not indicate causation. Tin manages to combine chic, naturalistic decor with cheap, tasty cuisine. The menu is set in an unassuming sans serif typeface and the check comes in a polka dotted book. The lighting is dim and noise level is moderate, considering how many tables can be packed into the space. At 6PM on a Wednesday night, Tin was a bustling gem on an otherwise empty street. I came with a friend and we were seated immediately at a communal table.\n\nWe both ordered the Pho Bo ($8.50, +$1 to add beef balls), which is beef broth with rice noodles, rare beef, and brisket. The broth and noodles were good, but the meat slices really stood out to me. Pho joints sometimes compromise on the quality or texture of their meat, hoping that the mere presence of red meat will appease diners, but Tin serves up high quality beef. I also enjoyed the sweet pickled onions (different from the onions already in the bowl) on the plate of vegetable condiments.\n\nIf you're looking for solid Vietnamese food and trying to avoid the heart of the Tenderloin, Tin is a lovely alternative.", "author": "Jessica F."}

Our food arrived about 20 minutes after we put our order in. And it wasn't until that time that the drinks arrived as well.\n\nBut when I dove into my pork lemongrass vermicelli (add the spring roll), it was clear why people were flocking to it and putting up with the wait. Possibly the best Vietnamese food I've had yet. Great dimension and grilled flavor coming from the pork, textures from the crisp veggies, tang from some pickled daikon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-11", "description": "This too-low-key Vietnamese eatery has been open for over nine months, and I had no idea it even existed until someone mentioned it to me in passing a week or so ago. Did YOU know it was there? I didn't think so. Imagine my embarrassment since I live just a couple of blocks away. But c'mon, how would I know it's there? It's on the most barren stretch of Howard between 5th and 6th Streets, and it has the most nondescript storefront with the most indecipherable sign. Yep, Tin pretty much violates every rule in the retail marketing handbook. \n\nOnce you enter, it still feels like a blank slate, a vision in minimalist neutrality that belies any indication that it's a Vietnamese restaurant. Wait, there's a skinny, slightly disheveled Gen-Y guy coming our way. Probably going to ask me to take a picture. Happens to me all the time. Oh, that's the waiter. Jamie W. and I are the only ones in the place at about 7PM. Once we sit down, we both notice a noticeable slant to the floor and the table dipped discernibly. We were constantly worried our glasses of Diet Coke would turn into puddles of broken glass. \n\nSpring rolls are the true litmus test for a good Vietnamese restaurant. Filled with pork, shrimp and vermicelli noodles, the $6 rolls offered here were on the average-to-good side. Not bad, just not in the ballpark of a Pagolac with a generous shot glass full of peanut sauce (see photo). Jamie W. went conservative and ordered the $8 Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong, which was made up of strips of grilled lemongrass pork and a cha gio (crispy spring roll) on top of a bowl of vermicelli noodles. Hearty stuff. \n\nMine required labor. It was the $8 Bun Cha Ha Noi. What came was a plate piled with Romaine lettuce leaves, a mound of vermicelli noodles, grilled pork patties and some morsels of pork belly. I was informed that I needed to pour said ingredients in a bowl with the fish sauce. Gee, couldn't you do it for me? While it took me a while to master the mixing, it was pretty good if rather sloppy since all that pouring and grabbing challenge my lack of coordination skills. Forewarned that it takes twenty minutes to prepare, the $4.50 Grilled Eggplant with Garlic-Chili Fish Sauce looked like an unappetizing mess (see photo), but it was pretty tasty despite its wet state.\n\nWe saw no indication of a kitchen. The food would just magically appear through a half-open curtain. We did overhear the waiter talking about the \"pha\" of which they were apparently out. The way he pronounced it reminded me of Cameron on \"Modern Family\" when he was trying to ingratiate himself with his Vietnamese baby's Japanese-American pediatrician....\"You'll be pleased to know that Mitchell & I will be raising Lily with influences from her Asian heritage...When she's ready for solid food, there's a fantastic 'pha' place right around the corner from our house. Am I pronouncing that right? Is it 'pha'? It's a soup.\".... \"I don't know. We don't have much 'pha' in Denver.\" \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty good Vietnamese but c'mon, Little Saigon is really not that far away \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...looks like a converted club...and could you fix that floor before all my food slides toward the drain hole \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly attentive...and he recommends the \"pha\"...is he pronouncing that right? pha? \nTOTAL - 3 stars...how about a more prominent sign...and some color?...just feels hidden among the SoMa warehouses", "author": "Ed U."}

I'll start this review by saying the one star review is for the service / staff / experience. The food was perfectly fine.\n\nFirst, when I got there with my girlfriend, they asked if I wanted to wait for one of the few two person tables, or if I'd be willing to share with someone else. We opted to wait. About 5 minutes later, they said never mind, just sit at a four person table (several were available) and we did so.\n\nThen a few minutes later, they sat someone at the table. When we mentioned this to the host, and he moved the gentleman to another table. Two more times a waitress tried to seat someone at the table (I'm not sure why it was a waitress and not the host, probably because he knew he had made a mistake seating us there) before telling us hostilely that if we wanted to sit alone, we should have waited for a two person table. \n\nWhen we told them that we did ask to, and after a while they changed their mind, they seemed to get more upset (and never once even spoke to the one particular host who had sat us at the larger table). Quite frankly it didn't make any sense why they would be openly hostile towards us when we asked to wait and only sat where the told us to!\n\nEventually it got so bad that we had them box the rest of our food and just left.\n\nThis was quite possibly the worst service experience I have ever had at a restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-18", "description": "It's been forever since I've been on Yelp.  But thanks to you, I've finally found a decent pho place in SF.  I was craving some pho today, perfect for a gloomy cold day in the city.  \n\nThere isn't much around in the area, about a block down from Bucca.  Luckily, I saw a picture of the storefront on yelp and was able to find the place.  It isn't flashy.  It has a simple modern sign in front to go with the clean modern decor inside.  There were tables for 2 or 4 and one long table, for either a large party or sharing with other customers.  When we arrived for lunch, we didn't have to wait.  But this might be because it was a public holiday.  While we were there, it did get busy and people had to wait for a table, but it seemed to move quickly.\n\nThe bf and I ordered spring roll, a 5 spice chicken bahn mi sandwich, and a pho bo.  We also got a pot of oolong tea. \n\nThe order of spring roll came with 2 huge spring rolls cut up into 3 pieces each.  I was surprised at the size because I am used to tiny spring rolls.  This could easily have been a light lunch for just myself.  It had nice size prawns with a slice of chicken or some other kind of meat.  The veggies (lettuce, cilantro, mint) and noodles were fresh.  The rolls needed more cilantro and mint for flavor and less noodles. It tasted kind of bland so you had to drench it with lots of the yummy peanut sauce.\n\nThe bf's sandwich was ok according to him.  I asked the waitress if the sandwiches were bahn mi and she said they were.  My bf ordered it since he likes the grilled pork bahn mi from BC Deli in Oakland Chinatown.  It must have been an American version of bahn mi.  It didn't have the pickled veggies or mayo sauce.  It was just a sandwich with chunks of  chicken with slices of cumber and carrots.\n\nMy pho bo was delish tho.  The broth was a nice, rich, flavorful beef broth.  Like others noted, it was a little salty.  The noodle was cooked perfectly and they actually used pho unlike my last sf experience at Miss Saigon.  The slices of raw beef was nice and thin.  They seemed fresh and of good quality.  The brisket was tasty and didn't have lots of fat or connective tissue.  The accompaning veggies (bean sprout, basil, lime, and jalapeno) were nice and fresh.  Too bad the broth wasn't hot enough to cook the bean sprouts.\n\nThe service was ok.  They answered our questions and took our orders readily.  The food came quickly, in a timely manner and our table was cleared as we finished eating.  We got our bill while we were still eating.  However, when it got busy after we were eating, it took forever to get the attention of our waitress to get a refill of hot water for the pot of tea.  The pot was small and she was nice enough to refill it  with hot water.  \n\nWe left full and satisfied.  I am definately going to come back for some more pho.

The first impression was quite good. The restaurant looked clean, new, and nicely decorated. Probably the only blip of life along that dreary intersection at 5th and Howard. This place was crowded (also pretty small) on a Friday night at 8:30pm, and there was about a 15-20 minute wait. No list to put your name down on, we just waited in line. There was a continuous waiting line throughout our meal and even when we left an hour later. \n\nWe ordered the claypot catfish, Hu Tieu (xa-xiu pork, chicken & shrimp, ground pork in garlic-chicken broth), and the garlic bok choy. Both the fish and the soup broth were extraordinarily salty. I'm not sure if the chef's taste buds were shot that night, but there was just way too much sodium. I wouldn't have expected this to happen in SF were vietnamese cuisine is quite common, and customers know how it should taste. The bok choy was the best dish of the night, but it's pretty hard to go wrong with vegetable sauteed with garlic, salt, and pepper. On the upside, the food was very reasonably priced, especially compared to restaurants in FiDi (like Sai's). Most dishes were $9 or under; I approve :) \n\nOn to the service. There were only two servers and one bus girl for the night, and it was incredibly difficult to get their attention for a refill on ice tea or to even to get the bill. I waved my hands numerous times, but they never looked to the corner of the room.

Then I saw the interior and my mind went \"Oh shit, this place looks a bit too nice and upscale to be a pho restaurant.\" \n\nIt is a bit Americanized. Menu is quite small, only like very generic Pho Ga and Pho Bo with choice of beef balls, some vegetarian pho to cater to the health concerned population. They do offer Bun and rice plates. Again, no broken rice and typical lemongrass grilled meat. \n\nPortions are decent, as in enough to feed you for a meal. Still on the pricier end for what they serve (serving size and variety). I ordered this lemongrass chicken bun (vermicelli bowl). Not too bad, noodles don't stick together and become hard to mix in with the fish sauce and vegetables. I can't comment too much on how authentic the taste is since I rarely order this dish, but I can assure you that the flavors are there. \n\nService is okay; they don't seat you and instantly ask what you want. That's good and bad depending on how hungry you are and how indecisive you are. Pho comes out much quickly than other dishes. I glanced at the neighboring table and noticed that they serve real coconut juice rather than the canned stuff.  Maybe I'll be ordering that next time I come here.\n\nNot bad for a place close to the mall and not yet in the shady area. It's on the way to The Grand so it's not in the ghetto SOMA area yet.

I'd like to give another star because the very sweet waitress was working the whole restaurant by herself for the better half of our hour-long experience, but I had to stand up to flag her down after we'd been seated for over 10 minutes and were only two of four total people in the restaurant. (We figured a wait wouldn't be a problem at 5:30pm on a Thursday, but be warned -- said lone waitress seemed fairly busy putting all the pick-up orders together and could barely pay attention to the dine-in customers.)\n\nThe other reason I'm okay with the 1-star rating is how queasy I became about 8 hours after consuming the meal... no \"results\" yet (fortunately I guess?), but let's just say seeing that insanely low health score a few minutes ago hasn't helped with the nausea...\n\nAs far as the food goes:\n-- I am NOT an expert in Vietnamese food, so I've tried to focus on basic principles of culinary enjoyment in this review. \n\n-- Meals came out in under 10 minutes of placing order.\n\n-- I got the Vegetarian Bun Vermicelli Noodle Bowl (I'm not vegetarian, but the flavors sounded good) and opted for the crispy Cha Gio roll add-on. The bowl and roll both looked delicious, but unfortunately, that's as far as my positive remarks can go. The roll was... crispy. Beyond that, completely flavorless: extra disappointing given all the other raving reviews!! Similarly to their fried counterpart, every ingredient in the bowl was devoid of flavor, even after pouring the vinaigrette over the whole thing. The tofu was fine as far as texture goes, but the shitake mushrooms tasted kind of rancid.\n\n-- My friend got the Bun Thit Bo Nuong (lemongrass beef) Vermicelli Noodle Bowl and also felt cheated of the opportunity to experience any kind of flavor. The effect, if any, her meal had on her GI system is pending her response to my text message.\n\n-- In both of our bowls, the noodles were cold and the other ingredients were a variety of temperatures... not sure if that's how it's supposed to be, but I'm leaning toward no.\n\n-- The pinot noir is decent, but considering they charge $7 a glass when it's a bottle that retails around $10 and the meals themselves cost $8-9, that's sort of ridiculous.

And we had another person in our party! It's safe to say we are never coming back to place this. The shitty service outweighs the delicious food.", "author": "Katarina F."}

I ended up in SF again the day after, and we wanted to come here again, but they're closed on Sundays. =(\n\nIn fact, thinking about it now, I want some more. That's how great this place is. \n\nAlso, we ordered five-spice quail as an appetizer. It had this amazing peppery lemon sauce, and the quail wasn't at all gamey. I ended up dipping the extra bean sprouts I had into that sauce because it was so good. It was so incredible (though small). This is something you must must must try if they have it (I think it's seasonal).

Alas, now my office moved and it's more of a trek to get there, but it is totally worth the walk. But hot damn, this place knows how to make pho!\n\nI love this place. It's so small and intimate and so good. I usually only come for lunch but went once for dinner and it was just as good. Now let's be real, all you care about is what to order. Again, I have tried not that many things because once I fall in love with something, it's so hard for me not to order it but I have tried a few things here. First up, Cha Gio. Man oh man, this is good! I love that they bring you the lettuce and the mint and the basil and the pickled veggies to wrap everything up together with. It's a fried eggroll burrito and I love it!! Definitely the best Cha Gio I've ever had. Their fresh spring rolls with the peanut sauce is amazingly good too.\n\nNow to the main event. Pho. For the longest time all I ever got was the Pho Bo with beef balls. Let's be real, I always asked for extra beef balls because they were so good! No chewy or hard pieces when you bite into them like you get at other pho places! And the broth. Let's take a second to just talk about the broth. PHENOMENAL. I hate salt and this broth is not too salty but not bland at all. If they allowed it, I would just ask for a big pot off this broth to take home with me. After 6 months of only just getting the pho bo, my friend was daring and tried the Hu Tieu. As soon as they brought it to the table and I got a whiff of that brothy goodness, I was instantly jealous. The next time I went (probably 2 days later) I took a leap of faith and ordered the Hu Tieu. Let's just say I didn't order Pho Bo for a while. I thought the beef broth was good but this broth. WOW. I would bathe in this broth. Garlicy, chickeny beautifulness. I could very well live off that broth. The meat is delicious and the little slivers of celery that they put in there just go so perfectly with it too!\n\nI love this place.

By comparison, the two really are quite different; but overall, Tin's just not as good.\n\nPHT2 and Tien are on total opposite ends of \"the Vietnamese restaurant\" spectrum. The former was a neighborhood mainstay with its hole-in-the-wall approach, while the incumbent latter has gone for the the new-agey, IKEA-like modern artsy look.  PHT2 had heaping bowls of pho and rice plates that went on for about 6 pages; Tin's selection of healthy-sized meals is limited to 3 or 4 soups, 5 or 6 rice plates, and barely fills up ONE side of a menu. Both restaurants' prices are/were reasonable, yet my dollar seemed to go further at PHT2. And though I'll certainly vouch that Tin's food is good (I've had about 4 different things there), the sleeker presentation made it no tastier than its predecessors' large portions, which definitely filled me up more.\n\nThat said, in the general area I'd choose this place over Zesty Vietnamese,  which was right downstairs from where I used to work yet I refused to patronize as I'm pretty sure it was a front for a Chinese brothel. Also, Tin is a family-run affair, and I'm all about supporting local businesses. I hope in the near future that it finds some way to jazz up its less-than-original, trendy-Asian-eatery persona, because that would really set it apart.

Came here for dinner on a Wed night around 630pm before the huge crowd of people waiting and ordered the grilled beef rolls with a spring roll over vermicelli and papaya salad. Here I was thinking oh.. beef rolls, should be meatier but as it turned out, it was wrapped around a carrot stick. How deceiving! Couldn't complain since it was flavorful, tender and just enough of that charcoal taste. I was equally impressed with the spring roll. It was the fattest/thickest spring roll I've had in my lifetime I tell you! Very fresh, lots of meat and just the right crisp to it. It was surprisingly a hugeeee portion considering my experience with Viet dishes in NYC. The papaya salad was delish too. Loved the hint of basil flavor and chili as well. So yummy! They probably could've used a little less of the carrot sauce (was it)? All in all, my stomach sang many praises of their food :) Lastly, one thing I wish they could do is do something about the noise level because it definitely contains in the restaurant and it is LOUD and I mean it gets really LOUD.

Second time I got a lemongrass pork shoulder.  BIG WINNER.  The meat is thinly sliced and very tender and soaks up a tremendous amount of flavor.  It was so good, I was trying to suck the flavor out of the meat [cue that's what she said comment].  And the fried egg addition to the dish-- unconventionally delicious.\n\nFrom a value perspective, I'm not sure it gets much better than this.  This was close to 5 stars (minus 1 for an uninspiring pho).", "author": "Jeff J."}

It's a little on the slow side and I think it shouldn't be too much to ask to have waiting parties put their name on a list instead of standing in line waiting to be seated. Also, be prepared for a longer wait to be seated during lunch. \n\nAside from those problems, though, I think they still make some delicious Pho. I tried the Pho Bo and the broth was clean and flavorful, the garnishes were fresh, the noodles were just the right texture, and the rare meat was very tender and tasted of good quality.\n\nWhile this place clearly needs to make up ground in the area of service, there's not anything negative I can really say about the Pho.\n\nIf you've got some time to spare and are willing to possibly wait a while, I recommend this place.

To start, their Pho options are tiny - Pho Bo, Pho Ga, or some vegetarian Pho. As a non-vegetarian, I obviously chose one of former options. \n\nThe waiters here are fast at delivering food, and have spring rolls cue'd up so when you order they can bring it over in 30 seconds, but as a result of this, it's not the most fresh when you receive it. It's worth noting though that during both of my visits here, the wrong order came to our table numerous times and when we notified the waiter of this, he gave us a deer in the headlight look. It was more funny than annoying actually. One more thing actually, when you're ordering, be careful about your words. We were asking about two items on the menu (that we did not explicitly specify that we wanted to order), and the waiter ended up bringing those two items to our table, essentially ordering for us. It was fortunate that we didn't have to pay for it, and the waiter didn't seem to have too big of an issue bringing the food back into the kitchen, but I don't think this is good practice. Either that or the waiter needs to be more attentive. \n\nThe portions of the Pho, for $8, is on the small side, and I was not too full right afterwards. Pho was pretty good, particularly on that day when it was a rainy day.\n\nClosest Pho place to my office, so despite the small things that could be improved, I'd come here again.", "author": "Austin W."}

Having been raised in a VN home, and living in the Fairfax, VA area (which has a large VN population and some great VN eats), I wanted to see if Tin would deliver what was promised.  It sure did.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere warm, and the service friendly and efficient.  \n\nWe shared the cha goi--made with the \"real\" rice paper wrappers (more difficult to roll and fry properly) and served with lettuce and fresh herbs for wrapping and dipping into the nouc cham.  They rolls were were crispy and perfectly seasoned, with large chunks of shrimp scattered throughout the pork filling.  \n\nWe also ordered the goi ga (chicken salad) and goi cuon (spring rolls).  The salad's light and tangy flavor was enhanced by the rau ram herb in the dressing.  The presentation was very pretty!  The goi cuon is a family favorite--and they didn't disappoint, fresh with mint and poached shrimp and pork.  The rolls were quite large--bigger than those that are usually served, so that was a bonus.  We sopped up as much of the peanut dipping sauce as we could....\n\nFor an entree, I had the caramelized clay pot catfish.  Despite being a little full from all the appetizers, I couldn't stop eating it.  The seasonings were right on target, and I ate it all, except for the one bite I offered to my husband.  Being someone who doesn't like fish, he was skeptical--and surprised himself by how much he liked it.  But I didn't let him have another bite.  \n\nMy husband ordered the lemongrass-chili chicken with vermicelli.  He declared it the best lemongrass-chili chicken he's had at a VN restaurant.  He finds that many restaurants temper the flavor, so that the lemongrass is not pronounced and the chili is muted.  He liked that he could actually taste and smell the lemongrass--and got a bit of a kick from from the chili.  \n\nMy two kids (yes, this place is kid-friendly while still being a place for adults to enjoy themselves) split an order of chicken pho.  They gobbled it up--my daughter lifting the bowl up to her mouth to drink the broth.  \n\nMy husband, two kids, and I ordered three appetizers, three entrees and three glasses of wine--and our meal came to $61 and change!  \n\nSo, of course, I met up with some SF friends there a day later and, again, had a great meal.  Banh xeo, green papaya salad, lemongrass tofu with rice, and grilled lemongrass beef with noodles.  All delicious.   \n\nYou should go.", "author": "Ngoc N."}

On my first visit there were no tables remaining available, so we decided to go elsewhere.  However, upon returning the second time a couple of weeks later we were able to snatch one of the last tables.  Of course, if they are filling their seats then they must be doing something right.\n\nService at Tin was very attentive to our needs.  Very satisfied with the responsiveness of the very personable servers.  Overall, Tin provided a very satisfactory lunchtime dining experience.

To me this screams: compromise flavor to cater towards yuppies.  However, after looking at the menu and prices my sig. other and i decided to give it a try with the condition of eating at a dirty vietnamese place once we got back to southern california.  \n\nI ordered the Pho, spring rolls and my partner in crime ordered a seasoned chicken and noodles dish.  The spring rolls were quite girthy and seemingly fresh.  Because of my prejudices of places that look like Tin I initially thought the spring rolls were pre-made.  Although, on my way back from the bathroom I peeked into the kitchen and saw a little old asian lady, sure enough, rolling up fresh spring rolls.  Well done.  \n\nThe Pho was decent.  Not the best and not average.  It gains points due to the actual RARE beef bouquet that sat atop the pipping hot broth.  The broth was missing the strong anise and cardamon spice but it was still good.  Again, the rare beef was the main focus.  It almost looked like tuna sashimi in the dim lighting.  \n\nI took a small bite of the chicken from the noodle bowl.  I would definitely try it again.  No complaints.  Again, not the best, and not average.  \n\nLast, we brought a bottle of  Riesling from my favorite brand wine \"Murphy's Law\" and normally wouldve been charged a $10 corkage fee but it was waived for some reason.  very cool.  \n\nThe trade off between possibly getting stabbed and yuppified vietnamese food was worth it.

The waitress was polite and let us know where to go, but there didn't appear to be a host working that day (which would have corrected the confusion). We ordered and were quoted 20min (which is pretty long if you are just ordering take out and the food essentially cooks itself).\n\nWe waited with a group of people outside because it was really loud inside and hot! Too cramped so we decided to get some fresh air. After about 5-10 minutes, one of the waiters brought the other group their food and disappeared back into the restaurant. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I see another guest who got there after us walk out with her take out. I went inside to investigate and saw my food and my coworker's food sitting on the counter and I immediately claimed it. The waitress was very apologetic and nice about it, but this got me pretty annoyed.\n\nThe vegetarian pho was really tasty and all the ingredients were fresh and colorful.

We came here on a Tuesday at around 6pm. Nobody was in there, which was fine by me. We ordered the pho bo.\n\nThe food came out piping hot. The flavor was very, very good. Not too sweet and not too salty--no overpowering spices. The noodles had just the right bite (and they are the usual type you get, not the thicker handmade type noodles). It tasted a lot like the good pho I get in San Jose, but the meat seemed to actually be of better quality. The brisket in the pho wasn't anything special, but the rare beef definitely tasted better in quality than what you get in San Jose. Even though the bowl is small, they pack it with lots of noodles and a good amount of soup. It's basically enough for an adult, I think, so that you don't stuff yourself silly (and I am one who loves larges portions).\n\nThe sriracha smelled fresh and so were the bean sprouts (didn't give a lot though, but I'm sure if we asked for more they'd give us ore). All in all, I think this is now officially my favorite place for pho in San Francisco. I don't think there's anywhere else I've tried that has such tasty soup in SF, for only $7.50!!!!!!!! (And trust me, I've been on the search for the perfect, best-priced bowl of pho bo in SF--Pot de Pho, Zadin, Out the Door, Pagolac, Mangosteen, Pho Tan Hoa, etc.). \n\nAfter the meal, we were pretty full (almost at the point where you have to walk slouched) and very satisfied. No stomach troubles and not too thirsty. I will be back for more!

Not what I would call, \"authentic,\" but definitely good.\n\nThe service, however, drags down the rating. Badly. Note that there are 2 waiters for the entire dining area. \n\nThe one assigned to our table seemed quite stressed, impatient, and generally like this was not his career of choice. One of my co-diners didn't have an answer immediately available when he was asked what he wanted, and the waiter curtly responded with, \"I'll just come back.\" Now, the words themselves aren't a problem, but the facial expression and eye roll that accompanied them, are. Non-verbal communication is so very important, you see. And people really do notice it, even if you think you're being clever and subtle about it. Yes, I'm talking to you, Waiter dude.\n\nAnother reviewer described the help as, \"bitchy.\" I don't know that I'd use that word to describe this gentleman, but I can definitely say that \"friendly\" is not an apt description of him, either.\n\nThe other problem with the service was how the food was delivered to the table. It's always a bad sign to have people arrive after you've already ordered, and then see them get their food before you get yours.\n\nAnd yet that happened. Twice. \n\nAfter we ordered our food, one individual and later, a couple, came in. They were already eating their food before ours even arrived. The staff seemed unfazed by this blunder.\n\nNot acceptable. At all.\n\nThe food keeps this place from getting a 1-star review. SF has many good places to eat, including more than a few worthwhile Vietnamese places. So there's no reason to put up with the grumpy waitstaff here.\n\n1.8 stars overall. Rounds to 2.\n\nTell you what: I'll just come back. \n\nJust kidding.", "author": "Tim B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-12", "description": "I'm salivating thinking about the food and it's only 10am in the morning! I'm always on the hunt for a great hole in the wall place that has character and GREAT CHEAP food (and yes, I had to capitalize those two words). This place has it. I went here on a whim with my husband and a friend of mine that lives in the area. We dodged a couple of bums on the way to find the contemporary sign lit up on Howard street.  When I first walked in the smell of the food is what got me, but this place actually has a classy and easy feel about it. Weirdly it seems like it should be a bar... but I'm totally happy it's not.\n\nIt was full on a Thursday night but we were able to get seated right away. The nice thing is it wasn't all Bay Area Yuppies finding the next new thing, it was just normal people that like good Vietnamese food. It did take us a while to get our food, but I think that was because they were getting a ton of take-out orders in addition to eat-in. We got the Chicken Wings as an appetizer with a lime cilantro dipping sauce... which was amazing. And we shared two main dishes (the lemongrass chicken rice plate and the Vermicelli bowl with Grilled Lemongrass beef). Between the 3 of us we killed all three dishes. Although the Vermicelli bowl's beef was not what I was expecting, it was delicious and light. \n\nMy friend definitely commented that whatever they add to their Sriracha is beyond amazing. We think they lighten up the mixture a bit and reuse the Sriracha bottle because the color is a little lighter than normal Sriracha... something to find out for next time. \n\nIn any case, a GREAT place and VERY affordable. Definitely going back here again.", "author": "Jamie P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-08", "description": "This place is pretty awesome. Real solid vietnamese food all around... at least from what I can gather. I'll be honest, I've only been once but I definitely plan on returning.\n\nFirst off the staff was extremely nice, which isn't something I typically care about, but it stood out here. I mean, its not like it really affected my meal, but it was nice. Ok ok, I've been losing some weight lately and the waitress commented on how good I look compared to my driver's license photo. I didn't think I was really making progress and I was having a rough week at work so any amount of human kindness really went a long way. Plus she had a great laugh. Why am I talking about this.\n\nThe dinner started as an outing to get some pho, and their selection was limited, but it they all looked great and I bet you could substitute items out if you really wanted. I mean, the slight differences in meat types are pretty inconsequential if you think about it. Its really just about the broth.\n\nThree things. (1) Try the vegetarian spring rolls. It's not on the menu but the waitress recommended it to us so we went half regular, half vegetarian and we wish we just got all vegetarian. I told her that, then she smiled and touched my shoulder. The regular summer roll had some pretty dry pork in it and it just didnt hold a candle to the veg. \n\n(2) The Pho Ga was surprisingly amazing. I know, I know - The two rules of Pho is that you dont get the chicken and you dont talk about getting the chicken. I was a little nervous that the cute waitress would look down on my choice of friends when they ordered it. Usually chicken Pho is an afterthought and a little boring, but this broth was delicious and more complex than the average old chicken Pho. I bet the waitress was cool with the choice.\n\n(3) The Claypot anything is awesome. I got the catfish. It. Was. Slammin. The waitress said it was her favorite dish on the whole menu. When she told me that I'm pretty sure she winked at me, but it was a little hot in the room so a bead of sweat kind of got in my eye area and I couldn't see all that well.\n\nSo my synopsis? Really great and definitely worth going back to. Their broth was as good as the places that serve just pho and they have a whole menu of great dishes on top of that. Only complaint is that the room was a little hot, forever calling into question whether I got a wink or not. However, that may or may not be a concern to you.", "author": "Erich S."}

The chef assisted by her younger son, creates remarkable traditional dishes reminiscent of what I had tasted in Vietnam. What sets her apart from others are her amazing pineapple-anchovy, creamy basil, sesame-peanut sauces. The older son takes cares of the customers in this humble small place...simple yet tastfully appointed. Her husband and daughter helps out in the kitchen. Truly another gem in our beloved City! Some favorites:\n\n1. Cha Ca Thang Long. Turmeric sole, dill, pineapple-anchovy sauce, vermicelli noodles. Evokes memories of the fish at Cha Ca La Vong in Hanoi. Definitely my favorite dish here. Amazing taste.\n2.Papaya Salad. Green papaya, poached shrimp, and calamari. A winner. I am not a fan of papaya salad...but this one won my heart. So savory.\n3. Banh Xeo. A rice flour and mung bean crepe stuffed with shrimp, calamari, pork, and bean sprouts. Comes with a signature creamy basil sauce that is to die for. Hella good.\n4. Cha Gio. Deep fried spring rolls with pork, jicama, taro, wood ear mushrooms, and glass noodle. Comes with fresh mint and a perfectly balanced tasty fish dipping sauce.\n5. Pho Bo. Rare beef and brisket with rice noodles in a delicious beef broth. Hits the spot. The broth is soul!\n6. Caramelized Clay Pot Sole. Stunningly savory dish. Contrasting tastes. Perfectly prepared. This mouth-watering dish is spectacular. Order this!\n7. Banh Hoi Nem Nuong. Grilled pork meatballs with pineapple-anchovy dipping sauce. Savory.\n8. Goi Ga. Salad of chicken, cabbage, rau ram, peanuts, and shallots. YES!", "author": "aL Z."}

We are die hard Turtle Tower customers but Tin is a great alternative if you want something else besides pho. \n\nThe crepe app, fresh rolls, papaya salad and fried rolls are always a hit and you can taste the freshness and quality of ingredients. \n\nFor rice dishes, the claypot catfish blows it out of the water. It has a clean and not-too-salty taste, so great with their Jasmine rice. Grilled pork is also great but nothing exciting. \n\nWonton soup is awesome and the pho is ok but not as authentic as I like it. Great thing is they don't use MSG, which is hard to come by if you go to the pho places in Little Saigon, including Turtle Tower. They are skimpy on the bean sprouts and basil but I suppose you can always ask for more.\n\nYes, the waiters are Caucasian but the chef is straight from the homeland and just needed waitstaff that could connect with the customers better. She is a sweet woman who is always smiling. The waiters do know their stuff tho, so don't underestimate them by their appearance.\n\nLimeade is a must, sweet and tart.

Apparently, as other reviewers have noted, other restaurants have tried their hand in this space, but I think that Tin's advantage is its fresh-start approach in menu and atmosphere.\n\nI appreciate the menu (currently a uni-menu serving both lunch and dinner; a more robust dinner menu is forthcoming, no doubt), as it reads as a best-of Vietnamese cuisine.  Make that best-of-the-best as the recipes are of family origin and executed with good kitchen technique!  Before I dig into my experience, I will note that most items are available as vegetarian, which is worth its weight in a star!\n\nI had the vegetarian noodle-lemongrass roll dish.  The noodles and vegetables were fresh, and its lemongrass tofu incredibly tastey yet delicate.  Nothing heavy or greasy about it.  Additionally, I noted (and had this confirmed by the host/server/GM) that the vegetarian dishes are intentionally distinct in flavor and textures from their carnivorous cousins.  So, for complaints that the menu seems limited, I argue that it's merely efficient as carnivores have twice as many unique dishes from which to choose.\n\nLastly, a note on the teas... I had an herbal, which was full of flavor and incredibly fresh.  I loved the presentation (loose leaf in a small tea pot that sit & fits into the teacup).\n\nWith a couple of months in, I hope more people take note of it and word gets around.  I expect a liquor license coming in the next few months to fulfill the intention of the owner as a casual place to enjoy a well-prepared meal with a decent wine or beer.  I look forward to the space maturing over the next few months and can't wait to enjoy the other items on its menu!", "author": "Nathan M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-04-12", "description": "I appreciate the polite service, cleanliness, and more stylish decor that you don't usually get at Vietnamese places. However, I wish that this could be balanced with delicious pho but it never seems to be. And $17 for lunch? yikes! And I didn't even have a beverage, though I did take home leftover spring rolls. \n\nPho Bo -  not great! \nThe meat was wonderful, the rest a mess. The steak was sliced magnificently thin, and served in a nice rare blob on top so I could control just how cooked it got by dunking it in the broth. However, the broth was not as hot as I would expect and the meat barely lost it's pink. The brisket was lean and tender - in fact too tender to get a whole piece of it into my mouth with chopsticks! \n\nThe broth was fairly bland, and had a cloudy pinkness to it that kinda freaked me out. Without the usual stash of condiments on the table, I couldn't even salt up the broth to try to improve it. The noodles were woefully overcooked and simply broke into bits when I tried to pick them up. I was served about half the amount of bean sprouts I would like but because the broth was not hot enough, they did not soften up the way I expect them to. \n\nAnd the small bowl, which gives the impression you are not getting your money's worth, is actually too full to stir everything together without making a huge mess. Even by the time I was done there was still a lump of noodles in the middle of the bowl that I couldn't break up. I normally like to slurp down a lot of the broth but there was so little of it and so little room I couldn't have if I had wanted to - which I didn't because it wasn't tasty and the look of it made me a little worried.\n\nSpring rolls - tasty and slightly larger serving than usual. I expect one shrimp per half a spring roll and these had 3, so when cut in thirds, there was a whole shrimp in each section. I had to ask for sriracha to augment the peanut sauce.  \n\nI might have gone back to try some other dish but I'm moving out of the neighborhood. Until then, I'll stick with Miss Siagon for slightly less mediocre pho and Tu Lan (lack of cleanliness and all) for bun thit nuong.", "author": "Laura B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-04", "description": "I wish I could give Tin a better rating, but the service was so horrible that it overshadowed the fact that the food was pretty good.  \n\nI don't mind waiting when a restaurant is busy, and given that it was the middle of many people's lunch hour I expected Tin to be busy.  But for the 10-15 minutes my friend and I waited for a table not one of the three waiters even acknowledged our presence.  During that time, a few other people came and left -- I guess not wanting to wait, particularly given that no one who worked there was even showing an interesting in the growing queue.\n\nFinally two tables opened up at the same time, and then a couple of other tables opened up within the next few minutes.  They were able to seat everyone who had been waiting.  Unfortunately we had to wave someone down to even place an order, despite the fact that we had been waiting the longest and some of the waiters were already taking orders from customers who came in after us.  When we ordered, my vegetarian friend tried to ask a question about whether a particular side dish was also vegetarian and the waiter answered \"yes\" and walked away before the question was even formulated enough for him to know what was being asked.  Fortunately, the roll did end up being vegetarian.\n\nFood was good -- not great -- but again the service was lacking when trying to get a check so we could leave.  Many people who had arrived after us had already paid and left and we were still waiting for a check.  I actually timed it and we waited more than 10 minutes for our check after we requested it -- and I could tell the waiter had obviously forgotten about us because when he saw me raise my hand an embarrassed smile came across his face and he went to retrieve our check.\n\nGiven that two of the three waiters served us at different times, I assume that all three waiters share responsibility for waiting on every table.  I have to say that my experience at Tin was the worst I've had in any restaurant in many, many years.  Even though I thought the food tasted good, I'd never go back because the service was so poor.  I know that waiting tables is hard work, but all three of the guys there seemed to be operating in slow motion.  The two who served us both lacked reasonable service skills.  \n\nI don't know whether this place has a manager, but they really need to focus on what's going on in the front of the house.", "author": "Jeff S."}

There are few things more discomforting than getting lukewarm pho!  The soup had two elements of which, I am not a raging fan.  The use of white pepper, and what tasted like celery.  They, in my opinion, are non-authentic touches that don't necessary detract from the taste, but don't make it all the more special either... \n\nThe service at this place is great!  A bit on the pricey end.  The bowl is very small, and the extra side veggies are sparse (compared to places where they just pile things on).  As a college student, I would say this place is not the economically wise choice to go to (for that I would recommend Tulan, not too far away).  \n\nMy recommendations: eat slow, enjoy your time there.

The Server (Ryan?)  balked at my suggestion as if I were I being a Boehner to suggest increasing the Medicaid age from 65 to 67 when I suggested we switch out the chicken for the Lemongrass Pork in the Pho Ga. Yes, take the Ga out of the Ga. I had had their lemongrass pork in my first visit and I needed it. It was a need, again. Yes, not the traditional idea to put grilled meat in the Pho, but you know... sometimes you look at the traditional austerity measures and you take risks to benefit the every day man (me). Thus, a compromise reached: a side of lemongrass pork for me to do with whatever I choose. And so it happened and, yes, the Server was right in that the grill char flaked off into the soup broth -- but it added a stellar dimension to the bowl. The Ga remained but was overpowered by the pork. And, if I were ever to have a sit down with someone to strike a deal with them, I'd bring them to Tin to share the Banh Xeo.

With all things considered, I think it is even better than my fave Vietnamese restaurants in LA.\n\nHere's why I love this place:\n\n- Ambiance: clean, nice minimalist decor, quiet and tranquil, minimal smell as is usually the case in other Vietnamese restaurants\n\n- Food: fresh ingredients, authentic flavor for most dishes, great taste, healthier and less greasy than other Vietnamese restaurants, clean appearance and visually appealing arrangement of food, strikes the right balance between being authentic and appealing to Americans without selling out on true flavors, been here probably 8+ times for dinner and it is consistently good\n\nValue: if you are used to the prices at those cheap Vietnamese joints around the Bay Area and possibly Tenderloin (I don't dare venture there to eat so I don't know how the prices are there), you might think this place is somewhat more expensive, but I think the quality makes up for that and actually their prices are very decent for SF city\n\n- Service: never have to wait for a table, friendly and unpretentious, doesn't feel cold and impersonal, can kindly accommodate large groups (should make arrangements for large groups in advance so they can make sure they have enough staff on hand)\n\n- Access: not too difficult to find street parking and if you come after a certain time, parking is free\n\nOnly one thing I'd want for them to improve is their hours of operation such as being open on weekends- I've gone many weekends with unfulfilled Tin cravings!\n\nA note to potential diners: once I have convinced you to dine here, please read below for bonus content ;-)\n\n- What to order: make sure to get an appetizer of the crispy egg rolls with your order.  The wrapper skins they use lend themselves to a special crispiness with fresh and great tasting but not overpowering filling.\n\n- Interesting note: one of the waiters is Caucasian and can also speak Vietnamese.  I just find that interesting since I have never met a white guy who can speak Vietnamese- usually if they speak any Asian language at all it is Chinese.  If you know how to speak Vietnamese, feel free to order in Vietnamese with him- he'll know what you are saying.  You'll recognize him by that he is the only white fellow who works there and he wears hoodies and t shirts on the job.\n\n\nKeep up the great work Tin!

The tofu at Tin is one of the best preparations I've ever had, it was so flavorful and the texture was spot on. We ordered the veggie spring rolls, loaded with still warm tofu, served with delicious peanut sauce that I happily swirled with sriracha.  Finally a veggie spring roll that's meaty! So many Vietnamese places put out mediocre rolls that they stuff with cabbage filler instead of real, fresh ingredients. The veggie vermicelli bowl also did not disappoint- it came with the delicious super flavorful tofu strips, shiitake mushrooms, shredded lettuce, a few peanuts and other veggies. The soy vinaigrette was a nice light addition to the bowl and is fish sauce free. Our service during lunch was quick, friendly and attentive, even with the entire place full with the lunch rush.

I get nervous when my sober waiters do that, let alone when they're intoxicated?... He came back to review our orders and literally had screwed up every single one (party of 3) orders. He started naming items we didn't even say. The worst part, while we were ordering, we had just finished telling him our appetizers (we hadn't named out entrees) and he - I kid you not - snatched the menus out of our hands while we were talking and proceeds to walk away. I literally had to shout, \"HEY! We're not done yet!\" Lastly, during our meal, I wanted some small bowls to portion out my noodles to my family. They paid no attention to our table.. I walked literally to the kitchen and asked for 2 small bowls.. One lady was there and didn't even look at me and shouted behind her, \"someone get this guy some bowls..\" I swear.

The food is clean, freshly prepared, tasty, and more importantly, has no MSG, except for the beef pho (however it's possible that the hoisin and hot sauces that you add to the pho may contain msg).  \nI sincerely believe Tin serves one of the best fried egg rolls in the City.  The lemongrass chili chicken and the chicken pho are amazing as well.  The lemongrass pork is equally delicious.  \nThe service is good and we have gotten to know the 2 servers who work tirelessly to cover the entire restaurant.  The place is spacious, simple and clean.   \nFor $23 before tip, we would typically enjoy the eggrolls, a pho and a meat dish over rice.  It is plenty for 2 people and very satisfying indeed.  We come here for lunch or dinner frequently and we feel nourished and satisfied after each meal.", "author": "Chris D."}

I can just drizzle the sauce on my rice and eat this all day.\n- Lemon Grass tofu: cannot believe that i would love tofu like this\n- Garlic Eggplant: MOUTH EXPLODE! garlicly but not salty. flavor awesome! \n\njust to inform you. that was 4 dishes that we 4 girls ordered. but i have to say i never been to a place, that i liked ALL of the dishes. especially my noodle.

Unless you've read these reviews most would probably pass right by. So glad we didn't.\nService was great and the food was fantastic.\nI tried the Chicken Pho for the first time and it was good, not as strong spice/flavoring in the broth as i had hoped for. Got a good tip from a regular who was sitting next to us to try the beef or veggie pho next time.\nGF had the lemon grass beef with rice fettucinne and she loved it. Especially yummy with the sauce that comes with it.\nPortions were very generous, prices are very reasonable and the service is attentive.\nJust do not expect a fine dining experience with tables clothes and atmosphere (we didn't).\nFirst time ever that we had asian type cuisine and were not hungry the rest of the night.\nTerrific!

We were seated immediately. Server was very personable; I felt welcomed. A very short wait for appetizers & the meal. It was my first time eating Pho Ba. It was delicious and filling, in a good, hearty way. All ingredients were very fresh and appealing. I did struggle a bit with the glossy plastic chopsticks, but I was out of practice too.There is a versatile mix of single tables and roomy larger tables. Quality food for very reasonable prices.

Usually we stick to the tried and true Larkin street places, Pagolac, Bodega, Turtle tower,Ngoc Mai, but we thought we'd branch out a little. Granted, we only tried 3 items, but still I think that was enough to get an idea of what the kitchen puts out and to dissuade us from returning. We started with the Cha Gio which were quite ordinary and tasted of old frying oil. Ive had much better versions at Turtle Tower and Yummy Yummy. Following that we had The Shaken Beef and Ginger chicken. The beef was nice and tender, though the sauce was bland and lacking in depth. As for the ginger chicken ( which I ordered based on another Yelpers RAVE review), was really unpleasant with a scorched quality to the sauce. The portions were quite small as well, which was totally fine since I didn't really want to take any of it home. Maybe we chose badly or it was an off night, but no matter, we won't be back.", "author": "J. T."}

I've searched for decent Vientmaese food for such a long time and my friend and I stumbled upon it on Black Friday, after a bit of shopping.  The menu is well balanced for both omnivores (me) and vegetarians (my friend).  Their deep friend spring rolls were yummy and were on par with my favorites like Tulan.  The lemongrass pork shoulder was tender and grilled to perfection and m friend was delighted by the fresh spring rolls.  He raved that is vegetarian pho was substantial and didn't have to deal with chicken or beef broth with lots of delicious veggies and tofu.  The wait staff was friendly and very helpful along with knowledgeable.   Unlike Tulan, it was clean, spacious and although they are still in the proces of putting together finishings touches to the place, shows great potential, but the food and staff are definetly the stars.  I will definetly go back again and again to try the new additions to the menu, which we were treated to a preview of seafood (shrimp/calamari) and tender pork crepe with beansprout and onions.  This was juxtaposed by a crispy and savory crepe.  The waiter let us know that they would be adding this to their regular menu with your choice of either seafood or veggie options. Great portions left us both satisfied and wishing that I hadn't eaten as much the previous thanksgiving day.   Although it's in a transitional neighboorhood, it is definetly worth the drive there and will be coming back to try their other menu choices.  Great family atmosphere, good food and excellent service - what else could a SF foodie want!  - Hopefully it won't get too busy.... :)", "author": "Paeng C."}
