At that time, i loved this place because they had good selections of traditional Japanese food which were sooo good! Recently, i visited Fuji with my friends and they surprised me a lot. Now they have all traditional menu plus trendy japanese dishes too. their sashimi was all fresh, well plated, and good. i really loved their Toro with uni on top ( melted in my mouth with touch of truffle oil flavor). Service was also good, friendly and fast. i liked the waitress named 'K?' or 'kay' a lot!! i am not really sure her name but everything she recommended were so good. i definitely will go back to try their Toro. Oh, one more, their Beef teriyaki was sooooo good, too (i don't usually order beef teriyaki when i go to Japanese restaurant because i order only nigiri and sashimi, but my friend ordered one, and i tried) their Beef teriyaki is like premium steak quality! juicy tender and perfectly cooked. i highly recommend this place.\n\noverall\n\nfood 5/5\nservice 5/5\nprice 5/5\ninterior (atmosphere) 2/5\nlocation (parking) 3/5", "author": "Chris L."}

I came back tonight with a friend when they opened (they surprisingly got pretty busy!). \n\nWe ordered the takoyaki to share, which I really enjoyed. I think it came with about 7 balls and more than enough bonito flakes, which I really appreciated. My friend ordered udon with tempura, which seemed to be packed with vegetables! It was a huge bowl. I ordered the chicken katsu curry, but either I forgot to include \"curry\" or the waiter misheard and my food ended up coming out separately. They were able to add curry as a side to my giant plate of katsu, though. It contained a lot of potatoes and carrots, which I appreciated; however, the curry itself was too thick. I like thick curry, but this was more like congealed liquid. It was barely fluid and was honestly kind of gross for me to look at. The breading on my katsu did not stay on the chicken itself, so maybe if they used different binding material, it would've been better. Portions were huge though and I had more than enough to take home for a second meal. \n\nThe two servers were really nice, so that made up for the not so pleasant curry. Kind of. Would I return? Not likely, but then again, I felt the same way after my first experience.", "author": "Leslie C."}

We eat sushi a lot and were absolutely surprised how good this sushi place was in a neighborhood not known to be culinarily adventurous. They have a wide variety of fish, which has always been fresh. There was a period that we ate here so many times a week it may as well have been our second kitchen.\n\nWe still eat here a lot but generally order out. The fish is always fresh. And the teriyaki dishes are also delicious. Just recently that the health scores have been low, but it's been super clean every time we've gone.

We went there around 6:40 pm for dinner. Placed our order. After half an hour, our order has not arrived. When asked the waitress about that, she said it was late because they were short one cook in the kitchen so order would take longer to arrive. We patiently waited for another 30 minutes, the waitress finally came and told us the kitchen was closed and that we had to wait for another 20 minutes before we would have our foods. At the time, a whole hour had passed since we sat down at the restaurant.

This review is only for my Korean style Chirashi bowl, their service, and their price.\n\nIf you know what a Korean style chirashi bowl is, then sans perila/seasame leaf, this was legit.  Tons of quality sashimi, lots of veggies, and small bowl of rice. It made me miss my moms \"hwe dup bap\". I'd go back in a heartbeat just to get this dish.  My bf ordered California, Spider, and green dragon rolls and he said it was good. But nothing for him to say stellar, but he'd go back for sure.\n\nService was little slow. There were 2 sushi men making the rolls, and at least one or two back kitchen team, but one server. Granted we went close to 2pm, or there was a waitress shortage, service could've been better.  The waitress was sweet, kind, fast. Still, no way for her to cover the entire restaurant.\n\nPrice was reasonable. It's not a deal of the century, but it was sf price tag.\n\nI am not sure of all of low reviews, I didn't read it, I don't think it's going to change my opinion much about now our regular spot.", "author": "S Y."}

Sadly, it was pretty disappointing because it was just tiny pieces of fried chicken. The chicken wasn't marinated at all, it tasted like those popcorn chicken you order from Quickly's. It wasn't hot either. \n\nThe Tonkatsu Curry, on the other hand, is very delicious. The curry was very flavorful and god I love the potatoes! \n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll was not disappointing at all. It was actually spicier than most Spicy Tuna Rolls I ever had. Which I am totally fine with that because I do LOVE spicy food. \n\nSo, the menu gave an option to choose between California Roll with intimidation crabmeat for $6 or California Roll with REAL CRABMEAT for $7. Of course, I chose real crab meat! The California Roll was very big, but I didn't really like the crab meat it didn't seem that fresh...\n\nLastly, one of my favorite sushi rolls of all time is the Philadephia Roll. I must say, it's not one of the best I ever had. I love raw salmon but the salmon in the Philadephia Roll wasn't fresh. \n\nOverall, the place is okay but wouldn't be my go-to place for sushi rolls.

The dish was flavorful and and hot, with the seafood cooked perfectly.   I had one issue with this dish and it was that the broth left me really thirsty, even though I did not find the dish salty.\n\nThe sushi roll was as expected and was quite large, so expect to share these.\n\nOur meals came with a green salad.\n\nPatrons seemed to be locals from the neighborhood.

No acknowledgment beforehand. \nMy GF ordered beef teriyaki, and I, the sushi/sashimi combo. And then we waited.....and waited....and waited....\nShe got her plate first after about 20 minutes. I told her to start without me.  She was half way through before, yes...I had to flag down the staff again that never checked in on us. \nFinally...after another 20 minutes of waiting (so now we are at about 50 minutes since sitting) my sushi/sashimi combo came.\n\nAnd it was stingy. For a  $23 dollar combo, it was really tiny.  \nThe tuna sashimi was half frozen still, and the yellow tail had a slight grayish tint to it. \nAt this point I was starving, and ate it in 10 minutes flat. \nThen..I did the unthinkable. I ordered more food, because I was still hungry. \nThey had a Crab leg special so I asked if they could provide it in a cone form, instead. The waitress insisted that they could do it that way, but it would just be the crab and rice.  She suggested if I wanted avocados and cucumber to just get a California roll with real crab. So that's what I did. \n\nAnd I waited...and waited....and waited....occasionally flagging down any Waiter or waitress that would acknowledge me. Meanwhile everyone around our table had been served promptly through several rounds of sushi. I would get a \"Yes! I will check on it!\" and watch as the waiter or waitress would run back and bring more sushi to other tables...\n\nSo....25 minutes later, I finally got my crab sushi...in a cone..not a roll as suggested. \n\nAWFUL SERVICE.

We ordered the Lion King roll, a bowl of Ramen and another roll (can't remember the name exactly, it is the pinkish roll). First of all, I asked our waitress if the Ramen broth is Tonkatsu and she said yes because I wanted a Tonkatsu ramen so I ordered it. The Ramen broth was by no means a Tonkatsu broth when it arrived. It was very plain, cleared, and lack of any flavor broth. Our waitress worked at a Japanese restaurant and didn't even understand what a Tonkatsu broth was! I won't even call that a bowl of ramen, but just a regular noodle soup with boring veggies and broth.\n\nOur Lion King roll was so miserably layered by a deep sea of thick mayonnaise on the top. I usually like mayonnaise on a sandwich and sushi as well, but seriously put a ton on sushi was pretty bad. The pinkish roll had so much rice and rolled with tasteless fish was also a mistake.

If you're here for good sushi, try some of the special rolls, including Finding Nemo and the Firecracker.  Between my friend and me, we were full after four rolls (Finding Nemo, Firecracker, Futo Maki, Baked Scallop). \n\nWe both felt the baked scallop was generous with the scallops but way too heavy on the creamy sauce (is it mayo?), which overwhelmed the natural taste of the scallops and sushi itself. We loved the Firecracker, which was lightly fried with tempura batter and had delicious salmon inside. If the Firecracker was too guilty and calorific for you, then the Finding Nemo roll will cleanse your palate with its fresh salmon taste.\n\nThe waiters were especially attentive and nice, so two thumbs up for good customer service.", "author": "Joanne K."}

My wife, son and I lived in Japan longer than the U.S., and we're hard to please. We've gotten used to the typical beef teriyaki and tempura combo bento, the odd, only-in-America rolls, etc., that you find in California, but the flavor/seasoning is not always right, or the price is too high for standard fare, etc.\nNot at Fuji. The chicken katsu curry I had was cooked right, the coating coming off a bit but not too much in the sauce, the vegetables in the curry in the right proportion, and fukujin-zuke! I never expected it would be so hard to find properly made and served Japanese curry in Northern California, but it is hard to find--look no longer, it's made right at Fuji.\nThe Finding Nemo was the sort of roll we'd seldom see in Japan, but that's OK--it was made well and tasted great. It was similar to the Rainbow Roll we get at Sushi to Dai For in San Rafael, but with spicy maguro in the middle.\nMy wife and son also greatly enjoyed their combo bentos. They are at least as hard to please as me, but the consensus was five stars!", "author": "John K."}

It isn't very visually appealing and can be easily missed on the corner, but once you're in it's actually pretty cozy like you're at a local cafe.\n\nOn a weekend this place was just the right amount of crowded, meaning that my sister, mom and I didn't have to wait long for a table even though there were a few parties ahead of us and people leaving the restaurant. Now onto the food; the prices overall are a little steep, but in the end it was pretty worth it for the amount of food you get. My sister got the tempura donburi, I got the dinner bento box two and my mom got the bento box three. All the dinner menu items come with miso soup and salad (PS salad dressing is yummy); bento boxes get a side of rice. We also decided to order a \"Finding Nemo\" roll (spicy tuna, salmon, avocado, roe) that came out way later while we were in the middle-almost end of our main dishes... I don't know if I would order both dinner items and sushi rolls if they don't come out at the same time.\n\nAnyways, I LOVED my bento box two; came with salmon teriyaki, a decent portion of tuna and salmon sashimi (these were FAT pieces and probably one of the places I can recommend for very fresh fish), shrimp and veggie tempura, and this side of spinach with ponzu sauce. The bento box three my mom got had two skewers of yakitori, an eggplant side, veggie tempura and california roll. Both boxes were about $17-$19 which isn't too bad for what you're getting.\n\nDownside of my experience: they weren't on top of refilling our waters or asking if everything was okay. I would definitely come back for the sashimi , but maybe to-go this time. ALSO pay cash for 10% off your bill!", "author": "Kathleen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-29", "description": "Fuji has definitely gone down hill since its reopening. I've been back here twice since and the first time back was better than the second but I went there with family members on Sunday and it was clear to me that the food and service are very much compromised; I don't even know if it's the same ownership! different cooks, waiters, everything!\n\nFor starters, I wanted the combination box number one; teriyaki chicken/mixed tempura with a few pieces of tuna sashimi, sushi with wasabi on the side and something that are like fried wantons or pot stickers that I didn't care for and white rice.\n\nI had that specific meal on my previous trip to Fuji and thought it would be an almost perfect combination if I could get all shrimp tempura as I don't care that much for most of the vegetable except for the broccoli but love shrimp tempura. So I asked the waiter if I could get that box with all shrimp tempura, even for an additional price and he said \"sure, no problem\" He then took everyone else's orders as they were ready to order. I felt reassured that I would get my meal the way I wanted it and waited patiently in anticipation for my food. \n\nWhen the waiter finally arrived with the food, I saw him putting what looked like my box down at someone else's seat but saw it had mixed tempura and thought maybe they ordered the same thing as me without all shrimp. then he put her box down in front of me which was all wrong as items on both plates were in the wrong box and my all shrimp tempura missing entirely. We point out the items that were wrongly placed in each box and the waiter says \"let me fix that for you\" and rearranges the two boxes and I point out that I ordered all shrimp tempura with my box as it was the first thing ordered and he just kept saying \"let me fix that for you\" so I assumed that he was going to bring me my shrimp tempura, but just goes off attending to his other tables as I begin to eat my meal. It becomes evident to me after a while that he is not bringing any shrimp and kept passing our table without checking in to ask if we needed anything. \n\nI finally flagged down another waitress and explained that I had ordered all shrimp tempura with my meal and that our waiter never brought me my shrimp. She tells me that shell bring me more shrimp tempura when it didn't matter anymore. I was just about done with everything else on my plate. twenty minutes after I finished the rest of my food, she brings me \"two\" shrimp tempuras and I had to save a bit of my Sapporo for a good ten minutes to wash it down and not have to order another one. the original box comes with a plate of tempura with only \"one\" shrimp tempura and about six vegetable. I was expecting five to seven shrimp but of course my whole order was messed up. \n\nAside from all of that, my teriyaki chicken wasn't very good either. the chicken tasted somewhat rubbery and I bit into two unidentifiable hard pieces that I had to spit out into a napkin and there was almost no teriyaki sauce either! just minimal on the chicken, but I have ordered teriyaki dishes many times at the previous Fuji and I was always able to mix the white rice and soak up the sauce with my rice; I have even ordered extra rice before and this time I couldn't soak up any sauce with my rice at all. We ordered a plate full of California rolls  with real crab meat to be shared and they were just okay. the miso and salad were good but that hardly redeems the mostly mediocre food and bad service.\n\nWhat pisses me off is that when you go out to eat, you go out to enjoy yourself and when a waiter or whoever brings you the wrong thing, all you can think about is how they screwed up your order and you can't enjoy your meal. the first waiter should have went straight to the kitchen and explained his own mistake, the chefs mistake or any other confusion and prioritized fixing my order, but the first waiter did nothing but mislead me into thinking he would fix my order ASAP but literally did nothing to make things right. \n\nIf it were up to me I would never go back to Fuji and find a better Japanese restaurant in the area or in San Francisco! there has to be plenty of them that are much better in San Francisco of all places, but I'm never the one to choose where we go out and eat.", "author": "David A."}

Plus, they did not serve it with katsu sauce, rather some unidentifiable brown sauce with chunks of fat floating at the top.\nSalad: 2/5 fresh, but they use iceberg lettuce, I may as well drink a glass of water.\nMiso soup: 2/5 tastes like a shiro/aka blend, leaning more towards the shiro. The flavor tasted like the packets you buy from the store as opposed to homemade miso.\n\nThe total for the Dinner Box ($21) and the croquette was $29.95 after tax. As far as the contents of the Dinner Box itself (purely objectively), the price is pretty average. \n\nAs a whole, I was not particularly impressed with the food. They have a stereotypical menu and the quality is clearly hit or miss depending upon the dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-09", "description": "We were surprised and disappointed when Fuji shut down to health safety violations and were looking forward to the reopening.  We returned for the 1st time last weekend.  My son says that the owners have changed, but the workers looked to be the same (I don't believe the cooks are the same - see below).  I was happy to see a 5-star review thinking that it improved.  Sadly, I have to disagree as there are a number of things that bothered us about the reopening.\n\nFirst, there is a new menu with new higher prices.  The dishes we routinely order increased by as much as $4 if not more.  To us, it seems like they were trying to recapture whatever loss income they suffered during the closure and/or to pass off the costs of the upgrade onto their loyal clientele who made it neighborhood success.  \n\nSecond, the increased prices did not translate to better value or better food.  In fact, I thought the quality of the food and the taste was not as good as before the closure.  Did they change chefs? Are they skimping on the quality of the ingredients to make more money?  The chicken tasted more processed. The tonkatsu portions were smaller than before.\n\nThird, while it was an established restaurant, we had a mediocre experience while dining there.  They seemed disorganized; they didn't acknowledge the customers who were waiting; they didn't have enough menus; they didn't have everything listed on the menu, and the list goes on.  It felt like it was a brand new restaurant (which in a way it is after being shuttered for 4 months) and that it opened too early before working out the kinks.  Service was average.\n\nFourth, they also got rid of the discount if you paid by cash instead of credit card.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing return.  I would have expected them to treat their clients better especially for those who have supported them over the years and who waited for them to reopen after the health violations.  During its closure, we were forced to find and try other Japanese restaurants in the area and we founds some very good ones.  I'm sure we'll return because of its convenience and to give it another chance.

Fuji is within walking distance of our new house so we were so hopeful that it would be as amazing as the reviews indicate. It was pretty busy when we arrived, but we were able to snag the last available table. After that, everything went downhill.\n\nIt took us forever to be greeted by our server, then to have our order taken and our order took even longer. As for the rolls, the only one we liked had such heavy cream on it that we had to scrape most of it off. As for the others, one of the sauces made it completely inedible and scraping the sauce off didn't change that. On top of everything, things tasted pretty fishy. \n\nMaybe it will be better if we try it again, but not sure when we'll feel like doing so.", "author": "Colleen M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-31", "description": "When I first tried Fuji's years ago, I remember thinking that the food was solid but pricey.  Since then, I've been back a handful of times and each trip has been less and less satisfying.  I don't know if it's because the food just isn't as good as it was back then, or if it's because I've found better places to go to, but my opinion of Fuji has decreased as their prices have stayed the same.\n\nOn this most recent trip, I ended up bringing my family here to grab dinner.  Since I had already eaten sushi/sashimi for lunch, I decided to go with Bento Box Combo #4 with Gyoza, Grilled Yellowtail, Mixed Tempura, Spicy Tuna Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4Dx_LtGrciojBXixDZoCvw?select=wadxpCwcxh79uf9UzRfuYA#8hOI5jUQqoc3hrLiBWRQmA) and a Hamachi Nigiri (even though it was already a lot of food, I couldn't resist my favorite).  At $21.95, it's not a cheap dinner combination, but you do get a nice variety of food.  While there were little things here and there that I liked, the food was mostly just okay.\n\nOut of the bunch, the Grilled Yellowtail tasted the best to me, but it wasn't anything you can't get elsewhere.  Sadly, there wasn't anything special about the Mixed Tempura either, and the only notable about the Gyoza was how the skin was so crispy (which I liked0.  Since I'm rather indifferent when it comes to Spicy Tuna rolls, it's hard for me to say how good/bad it was, but I was impressed with how it actually had some heat behind it.  As for the Hamachi Nigiri (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4Dx_LtGrciojBXixDZoCvw?select=wadxpCwcxh79uf9UzRfuYA#wadxpCwcxh79uf9UzRfuYA), they were generous with the size of the cut, but I've had better (and worse).\n\nFrom my prior experiences, the rolls/sashimi and appetizers are probably the way to go.  Some of the rolls are pretty good and unique to them, but the rest of what I've had isn't all that special.  Nothing bad, but nothing remarkable.  Fuji is great for the neighborhood but for that kind of money, I feel like I can spend the same on something better or get the same quality somewhere else for less.", "author": "Mike L."}

After walking through the cramped entrance, we signed our names under the wait list. We were 4th down the list and the place were quite packed. We only waited about 5 minutes. Along with that, the waiters and waitress were very quick, but surprisingly pleasant to speak to. I'd say that's top notch for me. There was a mistake in our order and it was quickly taken and replaced without any issues or attitude. For me, the service is 5 stars. The only reason I gave 4 stars in my review is because of the food.\n\nThe food was good and delicious, but forgettable. It did the job on satisfying a sushi craving. We had some tokiyaki, tempura calamari, Ebi Girl Roll, and I believe the finding Nemo roll. All of them were good and delicious. No soy sauce nor wasabi needed when eating it because of the abundant toppings. The finding Nemo had a slight spicy kick to it and the Ebi Girl has a crunch to it. The tokiyaki was good but needed some time to cool off before eating and the tempura calamari is tempura calamari. No one should mess that one up.\n\nAnyway, I'd come back here just to satisfy some sushi craving along with the pleasant and expedient service. By the way, the prices may be above average, but not by too much.\n\nLastly, if the check is paid in cash, there is a 10 percent discount.", "author": "Donn D."}

I will break it down as follows:\n\nService:  The young server could care less she seated us a dirty table without menus. We did not feel welcomed by any means.  Finally, I got up & went behind the counter and grabbed the menus.  She got the hint, and finally came to our table with a dirty gray rag and swirled around the food crumbs on the table.  Leaving us with the gross aroma of a filthy damp fungus smelling at our table. \n\nCleanliness: Fuji's is simply dirty!  The tables are sticky and the chairs are sticky & dirty. The walls (next to the table) are filthy! Greasy and dry food stuck on the walls. The floors are dirty with napkins and food on the floor.\nWindows are equally flithy!  Seriously, this place hasn't been cleaned or maintained well.  \n\nFood:  Mediocre at best. Plus: Sushi and Sashimi just ok - overpriced.\nTempura is greasy and vegetables are over-cooked and soggy. Goza lacked flavor and greasy. \nChicken terriyaki:  Chicken was fatty and the teriyaki lacked substance - almost watered down and certainly not enough on the chicken. So very weak.\n\nBottomline:  All of the above, give us many reasons to pause and wondered why would we ever recommend Fiji's or ever return for a meal.", "author": "A G."}

Thanks to Peteo's suggestion, he's got this one spot on!\n\nFOOD & TASTE:\nOrdered the Hand Roll Sampler, which comes with 3 rolls your choice of fish.  I went for Hamachi, Salmon, & Salmon Skin.  The Hamachi was super fresh, large pieces of fish, rolled with avocado... creamy & delicious!  The Salmon was lean, (I usually like mine on the fattier side) was also rolled with avocado, very fresh, went well with the seasoned sushi rice.  \n\nI also ordered Uni nigiri, which was topped with several Ikura.  I'm not a big fan of Ikura, since it's so salty, but it brought out a light \"sea\" like taste of the buttery uni.  It was so good I almost got another, but at $10.50 an order, I decided to pass. \n\nAlso tried a few other items on the menu... Double Albacore roll, Sushi Sampler, Amaebi, all of which were very tasty!  Mos definitely got my fill of sushi craving.  :-9\n\nCONVENIENCE: **** [Located in West Portal area, on a corner block closer to the Sloat Blvd. side. Street parking or metered spot.  Easy parking on a Monday.]\nAMBIANCE: *** [Nothing fancy, just your average resto. Was informed of their upstairs, which is good for groups.

The first floor was packed except for one table that would later be the place where my friends and I would be eating. We were greeted with a very unenthusiastic, irrashaimase, or welcome in English. Our order was taking by a rather unhappy looking Asian woman with black hair. She appeared grumpy and unhappy with serving the customers. This is definitely a bad note to start a meal off with if you ask me, however we later had an Asian male who gave us our meal who was very nice and friendly.\n\nWe soon received our edamame and seaweed salad which tastes good, however we soon noticed that the whole floor was being served by only two people. We waited about 25 minutes and received our food. I had ordered tonkatsu which is a port cutlet. It tasted very good and was displayed nicely. It came with a bowl of rice and miso soup which went very nicely with the tonkatsu. My friend's meals were also tasty and worth the money. \n\nMy friends and I soon came to notice that there were a agglomeration of people just packed into the very confined spaces of the waiting area. It was rather odd seeing such a huge amount of people packed into such a small space. If you may not already know, Fuji has two floors, despite the huge amount of possible customers, we assumed that they weren't opening the 2nd floor because of the lack of servers and the effort required to travel up and down the stairs, the second waiter, a nicer Asian male, was already sweating when he came to bring us an extra spoon. The owner, later came to help serving, she was much kinder than the other server, most likely because it was her own business. She must have realized how understaffed the restraunt was, so she came out to try to lower the work for everyone. For the future, I would recommend for this restraunt to definitely higher more servers and to get people who are actually kind to their customers. In the end, the food was good, however the service was not really great and the people just watching you while you eat was a little odd. \n\nTl;dr Food is good, service is not the best, appears to be understaffed", "author": "Gary L."}

If you have a larger group, we had 5 adults and 2 toddlers, they might put you upstairs and be prepared for slow service. The food as most people have commented is pretty good. Sushi rolls I wouldn't say are out of this world as its just sushi rolls. The sashimi is pretty on point though. They give your nice size chunks of fish and it is nice and fresh. The bento box was pretty good. The only thing to complain about is that they need to go upstairs more often and refill drinks more. The iced tea is free refills and being super cheap I'd like someone to at least acknowledge when a drink gets low or empty and to pay attention to out of way customers. I will definitely be going back because there are some rolls that you don't see at other places. Of course places might make the same roll and just add one thing to change the name but I LOVE sushi and sashimi so I will be going back to try other rolls I haven't before like the dinosaur foot, linga roll and a few others. Maybe take a few trips but it's always better to go with more people to try more rolls. They take a max of 2 credit cards with $15 min, and the 10% off is also shown on your receipt. Guess that is a bit better than the 5% u get for credit card perks and its all the time. It is a bit small downstairs but make reservations and you'll be fine. Looking forward to returning.

It wasn't crunchy at all and it was oily and soggy.\n\nMy Mom ordered the dinner bento box with the grilled hamachi/yellowtail. It was tasteless, rough, and not grilled well.

It had a strange after taste of cardboard to it. Then we asked for  an order of nagiri Toro. It was a good size fish but not like other toro nigiri I had before. Toro usually has a buttery taste to it and melts in your mouth. This one had chewy fish membrane  in it and did not feel that fresh ( the two piece we found out later cost us $19.50 which was extremely overpriced). Then we ordered two rolls, a Rock and Roll and a Softshell Crab Roll. They we awful. \n\nThe Rock and Rolls were huge rice rolls with tiny pieces of Unagi and lots of slivers of cucumber. It was impossible to bite on it  as the seaweed wrap was so hard that one could not cut it with the teeth and in addition, due to the size of the roll it was impossible to put the tasteless dry roll in your mouth as a whole. \n\nThen came the soft shell crab roll. It was even worse. There were tiny pieces of crab legs engulfed in super salty panko breadcrumbs and fried.  These rolls were  again mostly huge amount of tasteless rice and cucumber slivers with a dash of green on the end piece.\n\nWhen the bill came and we saw how outrageously overprice this restaurant is we were even more disappointed at our choice.\n\nFuji is a the worse sushi restaurant I have ever been to and is a waste of money.", "author": "Mahin C."}

I think its Korean owned, as the sushi chefs were gossiping in Korean amongst themselves the entire time.\n\nWaitress service is excellent, but if you sit at the counter (as my family of 3 did), don't expect any customer service what so ever from the sushi chefs. At least at a real Japanese restaurant, the sushi chefs ask patrons at the counter (who are sitting right in front of them!) if their food is ok, and if they need anything. Not these guys, they rather gossip to each other in Korean. So un-Japanese!\n\nWe ordered all sushi items, where the fish was pretty good quality wise. However, their prices don't quite justify the quality. A little overpriced in my opinion. Their sushi rice needs improvement, falling apart before you can take it with your chopsticks into your mouth. \n\nFuji is one of the few Japanese restaurants in the West Portal area.

Very welcoming and friendly from the moment you step in the door until you leave. Everyone that works here is very nice and attentive to your needs. And best yet, very fresh fish!\n\nMy favorite thing to order at Fuji's, and it's a must order, would be the Dinosaur Foot! It is prepared with spicy tuna red onion, tobiko, eel sauce, honey mayo all on top of a deep fried mint leaf. Trust me, you'll love!\n\nWe also enjoy their Beef Teriyaki. Unlike some other Japanese restaurants who over cooked their beef way too much, Fuji's serves some of the best beef teriyaki I've tried. It's very tender and juicy. You can choose how you want it cooked. Others don't even give you the option of letting them know how you like your meat. Their chicken teriyaki is also a good option to go for if you're not a beef kinda person. \n\nSushi rolls I love to order from here are as follow.\nLiger - Shrimp tempura, salmon, shrimp, avocado, and honey mustard/mayo\nFinding Nemo - Salmon and avocado over spicy tuna\nOmega 3 - Tuna, Salmon, Escolar, with ponzu sauce\nand of course, the Dinosaur Foot!! \n\nTheir bento options are also very affordable and they definitely do not skimp on their portions.

But ever since I've moved to San Francisco, I've been constantly on the hunt to find a new sushi restaurant that I could call my go-to. Didn't expect to find it here in West Portal! Fuji, located in a small, kitschy neighborhood, is the place that can cater to all your sushi needs. I always start off with the sashimi sampler and finish solid with the Finding Nemo and Liger roll. The fish is very fresh among the other sushi restaurants I've tried in the city, and the rolls are big enough to share among friends. I've also tried the Rock&Roll, which has a thicker layer of rice on the outside that I love. Be prepared for a true carb feast. I've noticed that most of the reviews teeters between a 3 and 4 star, but don't underestimate this place! It's true, weekends tend to get pretty packed here, so I've noticed that sushi orders tend to take a little longer when its near peak hours, but if you're down for the wait, you won't be disappointed!

The cooked dishes are standard, not outstanding but well prepared.  Great list of Sakes and Shochus, moderate pricing.  Some of the waitresses are really pretty, in case you care about that!  The guys behind the counter are friendly, if you sit at the Sushi bar.\n\nThe bad:  A lot of people have focused on stuff like the Dinosaur foot.

I ordered the seafood ramen with a salmon skin handroll.  The handroll was not too bad, but the seafood ramen was not very good because most everything starting tasting like the shoyu broth that the ramen was in.  Also, it seemed like they just threw a bunch of seafood in it, hoping it would taste good and then the ramen noodles were overcooked that they were basically really soft with no chewiness texture to it.\n\nAfter I finished that, I noticed the sign that says minimum charge on credit card is $15....I decided to be adventurous and try the toro (marbled tuna) nigiri and the sake (salmon) nigiri.  It was actually my first time ever having toro and after seeing it on cooking shows and whatnot, I was not thoroughly impressed and it cost me $19.50.  The sake was the priciest individual two piece nigiri order I have ever ordered at $5.50.  The taste of it was passable, although I think the slice of the salmon should have been a little thinner, but I guess it was getting my \"money's\" worth.\n\nAlso, the service wasn't that great as there was one struggling waitress trying to managed basically the whole restaurant.  At one point, she cleared away my ramen stuff with my chopsticks after I finished it, and when she gave me my nigiri orders, I basically had to go get the chopsticks myself because she wasn't very conscious of taking my chopsticks away originally.\n\nAfter tax, tip, and everything, I basically spent $45 on LUNCH.

Quite frankly, they're expensive here and no better than Okazu Ya on Taraval. In a few days I've had the same meal at both these places, tempura combo with meat, and the Okazu Ya comes in under $9 while Fuji is $2 more, gave me one shrimp instead of two, and whose salad was not as good. Plus the music was so loud I had to ask them to turn it down: there's absolutely no reason why one should be able to hear every lyric in a song while eating lunch, it's annoying and difficult to talk to friends. What happened to soft Muzak? At least it was inoffensive in its blandness. Now its net based streaming radio of some sort, blasted to the point where I don't know if I'm in a disco or a restaurant. And their choice of music was lousy, I don't really want to hear shrieking R&B in a hopefully quiet Japanese restaurant. And they only turned it down a bit, I could still hear every single lyric. I'll not be back, the expensive food combined with loud music made for an unpleasant dining experience.", "author": "Rob C."}

Does anyone else feel like frequent shrimp in sushi (especially tempura) is a scape-goat for freshness???  Not to mention, I am allergic to shrimp so I don't want to feel like a vegetarian trying to find something to eat at a steakhouse when picking my sushi rolls.  \n\nHere are a couple highlights to try:  (1) Dinosaur Foot, soooo good.

I do. Dang, sometimes I feel like getting out of my neighborhood and  heading to a nearby spot where NOBODY will know me.  Eat alone. Drink alone. Shut off the cell phone, eliminating any possibility of running into old friends, thereby ensuring that anybody I meet will be someone out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nWest Portal is my hood of choice when I'm in this type of funk.  And when I'm in the mood for something to eat, Fuji fits the bill just perfectly.  The 48 Quintara will drop you off 200 yards from the front door, and the L-Taraval will do the same if you get off right when you come out of the tunnel.  Ditto the K and M.\r\n\r\nTypical of Japanese places, there's a sushi bar where you can sit by yourself without taking a up a whole table.  Service is prompt, polite, and not terribly verbose.  If you order a beer, they'll always ask you whether you want a big or a small one.  The big one is a bit much for dinner. Unless you plan to sit around for awhile, get the small one (12 oz).  Come the end of dinner, I'll catch the eye of the waitress and make a big \"Check\" sign in the air.  She'll have it to me in minutes....and it doesn't take long for them to dope out change either.  As an added bonus, all the patrons are generally middle-aged to retired and for the most part pretty reserved. Boisterous, well dressed youngsters off to glamorous events are almost unheard of here.  It's nice....a quiet, subdued clientele adds to the consolation that everyone around you is going to have just as uneventful an evening.\r\n\r\nPrices are reasonable too....I usually get three rolls and a Kirin. After the tip, I've still got change from a twenty towards my first round at Portals Tavern down the street.  The rolls I get are...well, rolls.  It's hard to do anything too terribly out of the ordinary with California, Tuna, and Unagi Makis.  I took my friend Tassie here once....she got some outrageously monstrous roll concocted out of a cacophony of stuff.  She's a bit more clued into the Sushi thing, and said it was a lot better than average.\r\n\r\nLooking for a quiet place to eat and hang?  I say check it out.  If you see me sitting at the sushi bar relishing my solitude while lost in introspective thought, don't be afraid to say hi.  But if you see me at Portals Tavern an hour later, mention you saw this review and I'll buy you a beer!", "author": "Mike W."}

Her chirashi made me envious though because it was highlighted by a large shrimp with the head still there.  It looked like a large amaebi (the sweet shrimp), one of my favorite at some places.

One of those places that sits in a sleepy little strip;  you might not notice it unless you were walking right by. But when you do venture through the door, you're surprised to find most seats filled with people happily eating their nigiri and slurping away at the udon. It's popular enough that they have their regulars who sit at the sushi bar on any given night talking to the sushi chefs. The place is very welcoming and spacious. The service was really friendly and attentive, they checked on us consistently and cleared the dishes right away. \n\nThe menu offers a varied selection, while the fresh fish of the day are posted on the wall. They have a lot of different rolls, but one that caught my eye was the Banana Split. I love my bananas and all, but in a sushi roll? \n\n- I tried the chirashi don, a selection of sashimi spread on a bed of sushi rice. The fish was nice and fresh, and the portions were ample. Not exactly the most adventurous, however, with salmon, yellowtail, tuna, octopus, egg, and mackeral making up the sashimi. There was also a nice, large spotted prawn joining the mix, which made for a nice presentation. The sushi rice was also well cooked. \n- Also tried the crunchy roll, which was spicy tuna covered in tempura crumbs and eel sauce with some more tuna on top. The eel sauce really masks the flavor of anything else in this roll, so we couldn't really taste much of the tuna or spicy tuna. \n- Tempura udon - The broth was fairly light and the noodles were not too chewy. Tempura was ok, as the shrimp tempura seemed a little overcooked and the tempura batter was somewhat dense. They give a pretty good amount of it, though. The udon also has cooked carrots in it. I've heard that's a Korean influence, but I'm not sure. \n\nPricewise, I'd say it's slightly above what you would expect to pay at a casual sushi restaurant. $21 for the chirashi don, $4-5 for standard nigiri, $10-15 for big rolls, $14 for tempura udon (that's pricey). Open until 10:30, so if I'm craving sushi, I'll definitely consider coming back to this place.", "author": "Saunders C."}

We've been addicted to Koo in the Sunset but were looking to mix it up a bit.  While the fish is still good, I don't think I'll be going back there.  They put up signs and pictures everywhere and got rid of a lot of the nigiri.  It's mostly about gringo rolls now.  They were never a really traditional sushi bar in the first place, but now I don't think any Japanese person would recognize what they serve as sushi.  The pieces of fish are cut too big and there's either mayo, tempura, or cream cheese in almost every roll.  \n\nI get them impression that this is what the owners thought they had to do to keep the place in business and by all accounts it's working - there were huge crowds and a party of teenagers going on upstairs.  Still, feels like they made a trade-off somewhere along the way and it's unlikely that Fuji will ever return to their former glory.", "author": "Melissa Y."}

My parents drove 8 hours from southern California into town to see my husband and I for our anniversary.  We wanted to take them somewhere we liked and Fuji was one of our favorites.  Unfortunately, tonight was so bad that I am writing my first Yelp review ever just to vent.\n\nFirst, my husband just had knee surgery and I have a 19 month old little girl.  This did not stop the hostess from seating her friends who walked in way after us ahead of everyone who was waiting.  Then when I saw seats open at the bar after 30 minutes of waiting and asked if we could sit there I was told that the people she was going to seat there were outside smoking.  I told her I had a baby that needed to go to bed, parents that drove 8 hours and a husband that just had knee surgery.  I said if they were outside smoking maybe she should seat us first since they were taking their time.  She actually made a face at me and walked away with no further communication. \n\nWhen we finally got a seat, this same woman was unfortunately our waitress.  She did not even come to our table for 30 minutes.  She then came and took our order and brought back all the wrong drinks.  We couldn't even tell her because when we tried to she walked away. WE DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR.  We sat there for an entire hour with a couple of the wrong drinks, no chopsticks and no food.  We repeatedly saw people who came in after us receive their food in a timely manner, eat and leave.  By this time it was my daughter's bed time and she was very upset.\n\nAfter an hour of waiting with hardly any service at all, they brought out one roll.  The waitress walked away as we tried to tell her we didn't have chopsticks. We went to get them ourselves and she proceeded to glare, role her eyes and give a nasty look to us.  We asked for our food to be boxed up because my daughter was so upset we had to leave.  When we got our bill, we were charged full price for our drinks, and it was half price sake night.  We finally spoke to the manager on the phone and he took 30% off of our meal.  Unfortunately, when we got home HALF OF OUR FOOD WASN'T EVEN IN THE TO-GO BOXES.  By this point we were completely exasperated and decided it was simply the WORST dining experience of our lives.\n\nPoint in case:  we won't EVER be going back.

Nope, they can't do that, sorry.  I'm kind of a rebel, so I took my chances and ordered it anyway.  I only got a little throat itch, so no big deal.

I could not finish my meal, and I almost decided to never go back. Only its lasting legacy from the past brought me back again.\n\nLuckily, I have recently been there for dinner many times and their chirashi sushi (sashimi sushi served arranged over sushi rice) has not been problematic at all. So it appears that whatever issue it was with their raw fish has been resolved.\n\nI also really like their salad dressing, which is not the cream kind that is often served in sushi restaurants, but rather a light, house-made vinegarette. \n\nService has always been superb, and, while dinner can be expensive, the restaurant's lunch specials are very affordable, and quite moderately priced. The place is also well-kept and neat.\n\nMy only current complaint is that Fuji used to serve the best beef teriyaki in town. It was not over-cooked, or too tough. Since the change of chefs, I have been hard-pressed to find something comparable. \n\nAlthough Fuji has lost its flare that made it exceptional for me, I would still go there just because it is still an average to good sushi restaurant with good service and tasteful food in general.

A greeting from the chef behind the sushi bar is a nice touch. Good service. The noise level is low, and you can really focus in on your dinner conversation. Park a block away and you can avoid the parking meters. If you're on a date, it would be a pleasant walk to the Empire theater for an artsy film.\n\nI've tried Fuji a few times, and I group it with Yo Yo's in the Mission District. Both these restaurants are okay, and quiet my hunger, but they serve unremarkable sushi. I don't expect to thoroughly enjoy my meals at these restaurants, and I've yet to be convinced different. When I asked the waitress about sushi recommendations at Fuji, she pointed at mostly the $12.95 range. The prices may be inflated because St. Francis Woods is nearby, but that's some serious change for mediocre sushi. For Asian food on West Portal, I'd go the extra block to Hahn's BBQ for a more tasty meal.", "author": "Teddy B."}

The negative way of spinning it would be a little funky and distinctly cluttered, with a variety of tacky adornments on the walls and window sills, a restaurant in need of a what-not shelf.

Earlier tonight, my wife and I waited just a few minutes for perfect seats at the center of the sushi bar, right in front of the head sushi chef.  For a Friday night, the place was understandably busy.  We could see most of the other food going to other customers were a variety of maki rolls and other entrees.  Our interest was pure and simple:  nigiri, and lots of it!\n\nThe meal was surprisingly sublime.  The fish was cool, tender, fresh, and properly seasoned as appropriate, while the rice was perfectly room temperature, with the right balance of chewiness, smoothness, and subtle vinegar flavor.  We believe we were at an advantage with our close proximity to the head sushi chef.  The time from him making the nigiri to it entering our mouths could literally be measured in seconds.\n\nOur favorites were the anago, the bonito, and the escolar, all bursting with flavor and wonderful mouth feel.  They were so good, we doubled up on those orders.  \n\nAlso good were the hotate, the kampachi, and the toro.  Less impressive, but still good, was the saba.  The hamachi sashimi was very nice.  The sunomono was good as well - I enjoyed the fresh piece of taco (octopus) from it.\n\nThe chef did comp us a special piece of toro with a nori wrap, no rice, and some sort of light color salty sauce.  That was quite nice of him.\n\nFor comparison, my wife and I commented to each other that this nigiri meal easily beat recent similar meals at Kabuto and Nagano on Geary St., and Higuma in Redwood City.  While not cheap, it was well worth the cost.\n\nPerhaps our experience would not have been as good if we had not sat at the sushi bar, nor focused on nigiri, but since we thoroughly enjoyed this one meal, and I've had good experiences before at Fuji, I'm assigning a 5 star rating.  Choose wisely at this place for a great meal.", "author": "Mason W."}

And he stands there at the end of the sushi bar watching/staring at everyone. It's kind of uncomfortable, like he's making sure you like it/ don't have complaints.\nWell, I have one. Try using FRESH fish in a Japanese sushi restaurant, cheapo! I mean c'mon, who are you trying to fool? No wonder the place is half empty on a Friday night. My brother's first complaint was that the sashimi salad he'd ordered was supposed have 8 pieces of maguro- he got 5 and the waitress told him that's how the dish is NOW- not like it is in the menu. Hmmm.\nHave had better pre-made sushi at Paradise Market in Marin. DO NOT order any roe nigiri, unless you want to get sick eating old, pre-packed, unfresh fish eggs. GAMIEST Aji (Spanish Mackeral) I've ever had- and it was on the fresh/special list. Yikes! Wild salmom nigiri was not that fresh or tasty either. Hamachi was decent- but do you need a HUGE piece of fish laying over a tiny ball of rice?? I don't mean to complain, but the presentation is off from the get go when this happens, right?\nToo bad. Nice staff, good location, fairly brisk service. Pretty bad sushi.", "author": "Sean E."}

The staff are all really friendly and helpful and not pushy or too chatty.

The spinach oshidashi is a pregnant woman's dream - healthy (iron) and salty (it's spinach with a sesame, soy and vinegar dressing). If you like chicken, the yakitori skewers are wonderful. The salmon teriyaki is some of the best I've tried - and the dinner portion is very generous. \n\nSome people may not like Fuji's because it's not an edgy sushi joint, but it's excellent food, decent prices and a really nice, quiet atmosphere.

All the rolls where interesting, with a variety of flavors that make them not quite your typical fare.

It was one of the first sushi places I went to in the city and I continue to go there once a month or so. This rivals my other top favorite, Sushi Bistro. The fish quality is great, the rice is firm and moist, the seaweed falls apart as it should (ever had long strings of seaweed that wouldn't chew?? gross), and the service is quick. Lots of interesting rolls, try the Cherry Blossom, and plenty of sake.  Prices are okay too. Check it out", "author": "Tyler S."}

The quality of the fish is good, but the fish:rice ratio is too much fish and too little rice. So I felt like I was eating sashimi more than sushi, but it was still good. The service is good too.

(shrimp tempura inside with tuna and mango outside) Also tried their  Bagel roll which is basically their version of the Philadelphia roll but bigger!

Made eye contact with not one, but two servers. \n7:50 - Not a word from a server. Fuji remains empty. Crickets chirp. Stomach growls. \n7:55 - Go up to the counter and ask if I should order with her or if someone will serve us. Becoming hungrier. \n7:56 - Am told to have a seat. I catch the eye of aforementioned cricket and contemplate dipping it in soy. Stomach growls to advise against it. \n8:00 - Boyfriend is HANGRY (hungry+angry) and wants to leave. \n8:05 - \"Fuck this\", we chant in unison. We decide to move to the bar. \n8:10 - We are greeted by the SUPER NICE sushi chef, given a menu and place an order. \n8:15 - We are scarfing down roll upon roll upon roll, trying to forget about the (almost) hour we spent waiting. \n\nWe left full, slightly annoyed, swearing we wouldn't come back.

But you wouldn't really know this if you order the rolls cause all the extra things like rice, avocado, sauces, frying, etc., masks the old fish.  Believe me, my brother works at a sushi restaurant and so he knows all the little tricks they use to pass off old fish and i'm sure Fujis is probably practicing some of those methods.  But that ain't hate, its just the truth about places like Fujis that need to do what they gotta do to survive, especially nowadays.  So you want cheap sushi that tastes ok because the oldness of the fish is masked by aaaalllll that saucy stuff and fried stuff, then go here.  You want quality fish then you gotta pay for it at one of those high end places in S.F, or go to Osakas in Davis.", "author": "paul k."}

Big mistake. We are in our early twenties and were by far the youngest people in the place so we are guessing that is why we got such horrible service. We were seated pretty quickly, but once we were seated we were completely forgotten about. Which was strange considering EVERY time the waiter/waitress had to take an order somewhere they had to pass by us. We had waited over 30 minutes without having our order taken, so we finally had to wave someone down to even get our drink orders taken. Once they were taken though- back to being forgotten. Thirty minutes later, no food. So we ask whats going on considering others that came later than us already were done eating. They said they would check, never came back. Food never came, so we left.

It's really an unfortunate thing.  The food is actually pretty good and the prices are so-so, but goddammit, if it wasn't for the shitty service!", "author": "Darkie L."}

The rolls at Fuji are very inventive.  Just the other night I ordered the So Happy Together roll, which had tempura shrimp, cream cheese, mango, banana, and strawberry on top.  Weird but yummy.  I also love the Dinosaur Foot.  It's a deep-fried leaf of some sort with spicy tuna piled on top.  I had the Firecracker roll.  it was a very tasty roll with regular tuna and spicy tuna, served with a salad and a bit of some kind of dressing on top.  I took my friend here for the first time and she absolutely loved it.", "author": "Kandi K."}

I have been to numerous sushi restaurants in my life and Fuji Sushi really does sushi well. The dinosaur foot is my staple when going to this restaurant, but you can never go wrong with anything you order.  The magro sushi is out of this world and the portions for the sushi pieces are as big as any two portions at other sushi restaurants.  The sushi comes out fast and the staff is encouraging and has been able to pick up on my favorites and recommend others that I always love.  Their green tea ice cream with fried banana is really something else! All of their rolls are gorgeous but taste even better, and I always leave there stuffed to the brim.  Since the first time I ate at Fuji, no other sushi has come close to the amazing, mouthwatering, savory dishes that I have ordered at this restaurant. I whole-heartedly recommend this spot to anyone and everyone. Mmm getting hungry just thinking about it.", "author": "Bria G."}

The menu is basic, extensive, and a bit pricey (new menu, new wait staff), but the food is fresh and delicious.  I'm shortening the rating to four stars because the current wait staff discouraged me from ordering sashimi a la carte and steered me toward the sashimi appetizer--and no substitutions.

In fact it's what I'm craving this very minute.  And yesterday evening, around 6pm, when I had that same craving, I wandered down to West Portal (which is near my hood) and tried the place I've been meaning to try for the last several years.  I went by myself (my sushi craving before I could find a buddy to join me) and sat down in a near empty restaurant (it was a Sunday).  I quickly received my menu and tea, and I quickly ordered the two rolls I decided on.  One was a mango something or other, and the other was called Omega 3(?).  The mango was a little too sweet for me, the terriyaki sauce put it over the top.  But the Omega 3 was really good.  The service was good... my tea cup was never empty, and the check came quickly when I asked for it.  They even brought out a little orange all pretty and cut up to finish off the meal.  I'll definitely go back!  Though I'll stay away from the rolls with terriyaki sauce on them.", "author": "Luba M."}

The only criticism I have is the menu that they offer...I was hoping they would have some more affordable dinner combinations, like a sushi roll or two with a salad and miso.

It's a small place with room to add more upstairs but my favorite seat is at the bar where you can watch the chefs expertly compose flavor combinations that I have only found at Fuji. Friday and Saturday evenings tend to be busy and but if you go for lunch any day, you will find it cozy and not overcrowded. The food is fantastic, I haven't really found a roll that I thought was bad, although some flavor combinations are out of this world, like the fresh lemon and mint leaf on their 49er roll. You will pay a little more here than at some other sushi joints but the quality and freshness of the ingredients is unmatched. I would recommend anyone to this restaurant who wants to try flavors that knock you off your feet.

Needless to say, it's been decent most of the time.\nThe service is actually pretty bad. Yesterday, my in-laws, along with my wife and our 9 month old, went for dinner and sat upstairs since the bottom was pretty full.\nWhen the bill came, they had the nerves to already include 18% gratuity. I asked the lady why this was included and she stated that it's standard practice for parties of 5 or more. I told her that our infant doesn't count and that it's BS. I concluded that the only reason she did this was because she had to walk up and down the flight of stairs to bring us our food. I've gone numerous times with another couple who have a infant as well and we were never charged this.\nNeedless to say, I told them to leave it on the bill. I guess they'd rather have a few dollars in their pockets now instead of a steady stream from a returning customer.

We ordered three rolls, which at any other Japanese restaurant I've ever been too should have made me explode, but in this case left me hungry and broke. If you are willing to pay $13.00 for a piece of deep fried asparagus and a sliver of tuna cut into five tiny pieces, be my guest. Rip off. The next roll was all right, but again, tiny. Finally, we gave up on the \"Highly recommended\"  \"crazy-sounding\" rolls, and opted for a simple roll known as the bagel roll. A piece of tuna, green onion and cream cheese. If there was fish in there, I couldn't taste it at all. Sounds simple right? Now I see just how great my favorite places are.
