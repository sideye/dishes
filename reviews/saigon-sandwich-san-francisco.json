It is very cheap (only $4), and they do pack the sandwich with lots of ingredients (mainly pickled vegetables), but the taste was very mediocre. The pork was bland, the pickled vegetables weren't pickled enough, and they use miracle whip which is rather disgusting. On the plus side, the bread is fresh and crispy. The pickled vegetables are likewise fresh and crunchy.\n\nThere are only 2 chairs near the window, so this is a more grab and go kind of place. The area doesn't seem like a place you want to hang around in though. The sandwiches are cold, so you don't have to eat it right there. I recommend getting one to go and eating it elsewhere. They also sell some small snacks like Phong Kee Gourmet peanuts, which I enjoyed more than the banh mi.", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

But once you go there and order one of their sandwiches, you'll understand why.\n\nSaigon Sandwich is a link to a bygone era of San Francisco (hell, the Bay Area as a whole, you could say) -- A time when things were much cheaper and people supported local businesses and did so in person (i.e. didn't have their lunch/food couriered to their office via Caviar or DoorDash).\n\nAs the name implies, Vietnamese sandwiches are what they serve here.  For the unacquainted, \"b\u00e1nh m\u00ec\" sandwiches are a staple of Vietnamese cuisine.  B\u00e1nh m\u00ec, AFAIK, refers to the bread, but has come to colloquially refer to the sandwich as a whole.  They are known for being cheap no matter where you get them.  \n\nHere at Saigon Sandwich, there are just 3-4 kinds of sandwiches to choose from.  I chose roast pork on my visit.  The sandwich was ready in a few minutes.  I paid $4.  CHEAP.  What I especially like about this place is that, even though the lines get long, they seem to be very efficient and organized when it comes to processing orders.  One lady took down everyone's orders quickly while another lady prepped the sandwiches.  I also like how they wrap the parchment paper around your sandwich with a rubber band so it won't unwrap itself and make a mess.  How many other sandwich places / delis do that?\n\nMy sandwich was, to say the least, awesome.  On a roughly 6-8 inch baguette, there were plentiful servings of the aforementioned roast pork, plus carrots, cilantro, green peppers, onions, and a mystery sauce.  The sandwich was also spicy but not overwhelmingly so.  To have paid $4 for this, I was really happy and am not surprised that this place is so popular.\n\nA few notes:\n\n* Don't bother trying to eat-in.  There are only a few stools, and it's very small inside.\n\n* It's located in the Tenderloin.  You will likely see a number of transients and vagrants nearby.  They probably won't accost you, as long as you ignore them.  If this makes you uncomfortable, take an Uber or Lyft.\n\n* CASH ONLY.\n\nSUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n5 stars all the way", "author": "Michael F."}

I've heard great things about their banh mi. How it's really good. How it tastes authentic yadda yadda yadda. Because of all the ravings, I had high hopes and high expectation of how authentic it will taste like. And, maybe that's partially why I'm not giving this a stellar review because my expectation was a wee bit high. And...I know how Vietnamese food tastes like.\n\nLet's start by saying, this ain't authentic banh mi. But it was still good. I'd like to say it's a hybrid banh mi...between Vietnamese and Chinese. The bread wasn't the consistency that I'm used to from San Jose or L.A but it was decent. They put some sauce in the sandwich. It wasn't the typical mayo sauce. There was definitely some mayo sauce along with a brown sauce. I know other people like that brown sauce and some ask for extra sauce but honestly, that brown sauce kinda threw me off because it made the sandwich tastes different than the traditional banh mi. I thought it overpowered other ingredients in the banh mi.\n\nMaybe, next time, I'll ask for less brown sauce and see how that'll turn out to be. This place is good but it's not as authentic as I thought it would be. But, I'd come back when I have a craving for banh mi.", "author": "Ngoc P."}

It's on the smaller side of banh mi sandwich lengths I would say.... but hey, for $4 you can just get two. They also don't cut the sandwich in half for you... perhaps that is something you should request prior to them handing it to you (fastest service ever). Although, I did mention to the lady that I didn't want cilantro and also wanted to change my pate sandwich to combo: I got neither requests fulfilled LOL. Sooooo if you have special accommodations, make sure to really spell it for them since their English isn't that great. Plenty of standard banh mi toppings.... delicious sandwich. Would love to go back again. Also note that you pay after you receive tour sandwich. Cash onlyyyyyy.\n\nTwo chairs in the store for two lucky people to sit. Wouldn't really recommend sitting anywhere near here since there isn't a place to sit and not sure you would want to chill around the area anyways.

Saigon Sandwich and L&G Vietnamese Sandwich are two that are literally across from each other.\n\nI decided to try Saigon Sandwich first as it had a 4.5 star rating with almost 3000 reviews. It is small shop that generally has a line out of the door. The good news is that it moves pretty fast. The menu is pretty limited with I think 6 different types of Banh-mi which includes steam pork, roast port, pork pate, roast chicken and the combination. Prices of most of the sandwiches are $4 with tax.\n\nI generally get a couple of roast chickens which are enough for a full meal. The sandwiches are solid. The only complaint will be that the French roll is a little to crispy, but I like it.

I thought the combination was pretty interesting... different than the regular cold cut sandwich. It erred on the sweeter side, perhaps because of the pate - the pate was definitely on the sweeter side and there was a super generous portion of it. The sandwich itself looks pretty small but it has a hefty weight to it. \n\nIt's $5 for a sandwich and you they have it prepped and delivered in your hands in minutes. Great for a quick lunch.

The value that you get from this place is amazing - An assortment of Banh Mi ranging from $4-$5 in San Francisco? Sounds pretty unheard of, but at this local hole in the wall that is exactly what is being served. On the blackboard to the right when you enter is the many of different types of Banh Mi that you can order, ranging from the traditional combination Banh Mi to specialties such as Pate. In the back of the shop you can see all of the Vietnamese ladies hard at work, piling on loads of pickled radish and carrots and meat onto baguette rolls. The bread itself is not baked fresh - you can see them heating it up in a toaster oven in the back, and when you bite into the bread, it is a bit hard.\n\nI ordered the Combination and the Pate Banh mi. Both were pretty good - the meat from the combination Banh mi was nice and flavorful, and the mousse from the Pate Banh mi was rich yet delicate. However, what makes this place special is their sauce that they slather onto the Banh mi. It's sweet and savory, and oozes out of the Banh mi when you bite into it. It's a tad bit too sweet and heavy for my taste, but it's still delicious. The bread as I mentioned before is a bit hard - and for those reasons I give this place a solid 4 out of 5 stars.

It was one of the first places I came to when I visited San Francisco in early 2016. Almost two years later, and it remains one of my favorite locations in the city. The ladies working there have warmed up to me (probably because I used to show up nearly 3 times a week for a few months), and $4.00 for a filling sandwich is a steal- not to mention the taste is better than any other spot I've tried.\n\nAMBIANCE is quaint. It's a tiny shop- if you arrive after 10 am, you'll notice a line forming down the street. It's that popular. I learned to arrive between 8 and 9 am, where there is little to no line. There are a couple chairs to sit, but with everyone in line to get food, it's a cramped experience. Walk down Larkin and turn right on Turk to find a few spots to sit and enjoy your meal.\n\nFOOD is always amazing. I get the roast pork banh mi, which is delicious. They really stuff the sandwiches with the meat, veggies, and sauce, so you always get the bang for your buck (take notes, Chipotle). There's lots of Vietnamese treats inside- I've tried a few and highly recommend them.\n\nRATING is a favorite five. I adore this spot. If you are considering this spot on a list of things to do or try in the city, this should be #1 (make sure you get there early- they open at 7:00 am, so no excuses!).", "author": "Nicholas G."}

Generally the banh mi uses a fattier type of pork for the BBQ pork, and here it looked like they mostly used lean pieces of pork. The flavors also tend to be more intense.\n\nWhile it was still good, this healthier version doesn't quite encapsulate the essence of the BBQ pork Vietnamese sandwich in my opinion, and is more of a westernized version of the dish (even though the dish itself has western influences).\n\nI also had the Che 3 Mau, which was in a cup and is a coconut milk dessert with mung bean, red beans, and tapioca pieces.

For those of you who don't know (please tell me you do), a banh mii Sandwich is a sub comprised of some meat, carrots, sometimes daikon radish, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, and a mayo spread. I wholeheartedly consider it Vietnamese fast food that people order for cheap on the go.\n\nGrowing up in Garden Grove, CA near Little Saigon, I've definitely had my fair share of Vietnamese sandwiches from a variety of average-above average places ranging from the generic Lee's Sandwiches (you'd consider this the Vietnamese version of McDonald's to the more niche hole in the wall shops like Banh Mi Che Cali (it is a chain but there's fewer compared to international Lee's). And in NorCal, I've actually found a good number of places. Shout out to Cam Hung in Downtown Oakland and Huon Lan Sandwich in East San Jose. But when I heard wind of a \"legendary\" Vietnamese sandwich shop in San Francisco by the name of Saigon Sandwich, I had to try it out.\n\nSaigon Sandwich is located in Larkin St within the Tenderloin. To come here, I highly recommend just traveling via public transportation (either by foot, barting via Civic Center, or hopping on a Muni). Parking is trash here and traffic is horrendous. I'd also call in ahead of time to skip lines. And make sure you don't come right when they close like I did because they will RUN OUT OF BREAD. They close early (around 5:30), so this will probably be a lunch option.\n\nThe two things you should know about Saigon Sandwich is that 1. They're cash only and 2. They only have like four options. My girlfriend and I ended up getting the Pork Pate combo (shoutout to my friend for getting them). So how was it?\n\nImagine you take the holiness that is Ike's Dutch crunch bread and add it to the most amazing combination of fresh Banh Mi ingredients. You get Saigon Sandwich. For around $4.5, you get one of the most stuffing Vietnamese sandwiches I've had. Our Pork Pate sandwich was HUGE. Even though it looks small lengthwise, boy they packed a bunch of sliced meat and grounded meat. It tasted so delicious that I wanted to just keep licking my plate. But honestly, what make Saigon Sandwich the A++ experience was the bread itself. Even as leftover, toast it around 350 degrees F for 9 minutes and you will get a legendary crunch. OMG, it was soo good. Though many would beg to differ, I'd say Saigon Sandwich eclipses the subs I've had back at home. It's definitely on par with Oakland's Cam Hung.\n\nOverall, Saigon Sandwiches is a must in the city if you want something delicious and cheap. Especially if you have never had banh mi in your life, do yourself a favor and go. I give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this!\" \n\nEat well and prosper folks,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Then our fresh items, the cilantro carrots and jalape\u00f1os all taste as if they have been picked from the garden yesterday.  Lastly, the star of the show the secret sauce.  It is to die for, somehow it is dripping out of the sides and yet it still leaves you wanting more.  \nLast but not least the best part about this sandwich is that they are 4 dollars! Yes, you heard right.  They are four dollars! Which if anyone knows San Francisco prices, that's basically free.\nIn all honesty, I was pleasantly surprised and will surely come back for this amazing sandwich!", "author": "Paulina C."}

The bread itself was quite substantial, but the design of the classic french roll made it difficult to eat a sandwich stuffed to the brim. With every bite, meat would slip out from one end, and the mayonnaise +pate mixture would ooze out from the other. It was quite a delicious predicament. For a meal under 5 dollars, this was a great bargain, and the taste was quite alright. I'm a bit partial to so. cal style banh mi where head cheese with large peppercorns are sprinkled into the mix and this combination banh mi didn't have that type of ham.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-20", "description": "I was told about a very famous Bahn Mi sandwich shop in San Francisco. He did not remember the name but luckily it was easy to find as it had the most reviews. Luckily we were in the area shopping around and decided to head over there through uber for a late Lunner. The inside is super tiny. Tiny as in you basically just order and leave or eat outside, while walking. There was only 2 chairs inside, facing the window, which got pretty hot and sunny. Because we got there close to 4:45-5 there was no line. It's a very small hole in the wall kind of place that is authentic. \n\nThe menu is small, simple and straight to the point. There is no description or picture so you are better off knowing what you want to order, because when I asked the lady questions she was very unpleasant and not helpful at all. I don't know if it's because there was a language barrier but she seemed like she wanted us to hurry and order or leave. FYI: CASH ONLY!\n\n_Roast Pork ($4) Pork, pate, pickled veggies. We decided to share one since we were going to eat dinner soon after but after my gf had a few bites she wanted another one. It was so good! The bread was nicely toasted, soft on the inside and crisp on the outside, although I can see it being a bit more on the crisp/harder side. They added a good amount of pate, where you can just taste it. The pork was well cooked and they gave a food amount. I do think it could have been a bit more tender but still pretty good. I wish they added more veggies because the end of my sandwich had nothing, and once the veggies were gone it did not taste as good, and it needed something to counter act the richness from the pate and pork. I just wish the lady cut the sandwich a bit more evenly or in the middle, because one side was way smaller than the other. Only because we were sharing, otherwise would not have mattered. But no big deal.\n_Roast Chicken ($4) Chicken, pate, pickled veggies. This time, since I got greedy on how good the pate and lack of veggies, I ordered extra veggies and pate. I may have made a mistake, because even though it was good it was way too rich and heavy. The chicken was good, but needed more seasoning/flavor and It was a tad bit dry. My gf and I bother preferred the pork over the chicken. Maybe it was also because the pate overwhelmed the flavor of the chicken. But it did taste better with extra veggies. I think it may have been $1 extra for the veggies and pate or $1 each. Either way still very cheap.\n\nI would be a regular If I lived in SF. And for those visiting, I do recommend checking this place out at least once!", "author": "Vanessa M."}

It is not a sit down restaurant, get your food and go. Inside the restaurant is tiny and the line usually goes out the door. You wouldn't want to stay around the area, it's a bad neighborhood, so get the sandwich and get the hell out. You will know why the Tenderloin has a bad rep after walking around. \n\nFOOD\nI got the combo sandwich ($4.50) which includes all the various meat, carrots, jalape\u00f1os, and cilantro. The bread has a crunchy and hard texture, so it can be difficult eating on the go. They pack the sandwiches to the brim, so you will definitely been getting your money's worth. They're considered to be the best Banh mi shop in SF and I agree. Super flavorful and authentic Vietnamese sandwiches. \n\nSERVICE\nCash only. The workers work in rapid succession, so be ready to tell them what type of sandwich you want and don't expect any customer service. After they complete your sandwich, pay for it and take your leave.\n\nCONCLUSION\nSaigon Sandwiches is a delicious and authentic Banh Mi store. The prices are cheap and they don't skim on the meat or veggies. The workers work fast, so the line should move at a good pace even if it's a long line.

It's located a few blocks from Civic Center in Little Saigon. Stopped by around 2pm on a Sat with my parents just to see what all the hype was about, no line!\n\nPricewise, you can't go wrong here. All the sandwiches are $4, with some of the special combos being $4.75-cheaper than a Subway sandwich. I got the fancy pork sandwich and the roast pork sandwich, both $4 a pop.\n\nThey are pretty quick getting all the sandwiches made. Their bread, which everyone raves about is truly good. It's toasted crispy but not tough and hard. And they pack on the meat generously. However, I think what stood out was that they don't glop on the mayo like other places; while they put some on, they also put on more generously a sweet and sour tasting sauce that, with the pickled veg, cuts through all that fat of the meat and mayo.\n\nI saved one roast pork sandwich for the next day, and it was still yummy! The bread wasn't too hard and was such a great lunch. \n\nAnd for $4, I basically got double the size of what I normally pay $6-7 for at Dinosaurs.

Flavorful but slightly over powered by five spice powder. Generous amount of meat. Flavor blended the best with the other ingredients in the sandwich. There was one extremely hot jalapeno slice in this one for some reasons, bf was dying after that bite.\n\n2. Special combination - jumble of different Vietnamese \"ham\" and other sliced meats. Quite heavy on pate taste. Like a cold cut sandwich of the Vietnamese world. Wish the bread was toasted more since everything inside is cold.\n\n3. Pork meatball - it's like a deconstructed shu mai with a shit ton of black pepper, then shoved between bread and called a sandwich. It's flavorful, but idk... It's really too much black pepper. \n\n4. Roast chicken - idk... Flavor profile primarily was soy sauce.

So we proceed to order and he orders in Vietnamese and turns to use and says that he order off the menu. Hey a collective \"cool\" was given. I respect it. I'll talk slang at the bbq spot to show off so I'm not one to judge. Sandwiches start getting made and I watch to see what it was that he ordered. Bruh.... It was roast pork.

It's always been...\n\nThe standard.  \n\nOnly thing is since I've been making this place got over the past decade they've taken advantage. 4 bucks a sandwich is where we're at these days and while still quite reasonable I long for the 1.75 days. In any case walk in as a person is walking out to now find the place empty. Walk right up and there was a lady I haven't seen before and she took my order and started the sandwiches. She was pleasant enough and the assembly line took shape. Lots of fresh carrots and jalape\u00f1os but didn't see many onions in the carrot mixture. Still too many stalks of cilantro wish they would just do the leaves. Me and my first world problems. Meatball always juicy and while that's it for my lady I go plus pate and for me it makes all the difference. The texture of the pate and meatball is slightly mushy but the crispness of the carrots and jalape\u00f1o as well as the crusty bread create a great mouthfeel. \n\nAdded a bag of shrimp chips with wasabi for a little bit more crunch. \n\nOne of the few places that still stocks green tea ginger ale so that's always something I look forward to.

That sandwich was literally ready in less than 2 minutes from ordering.  I didn't even have time to put the change back in my wallet before the lady handed me the warm wrapped sandwich.  Don't let the line going out the door intimidate you.\n\nThe menu is pretty limited but the ingredients to make them really shine. The sandwich contained super fresh vegetables - some pickled, some raw.  There was the right mix of salty, spicy and sour.  The pork meat was juicy and well seasoned.  The sandwich was stuffed and had a good ratio of meat to veg.  The bread was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  \n\nOn a subsequent visit I order the special combination, a mix of ham, special pork and pate.  The sandwich was good and very, very filling. Despite the three meats I didn't find that any of them really stood out on their own.   While it was tasty, I preferred the pork meatball sandwich for the pronounced flavor of that meat.  \n\nThere are drinks, chips and some Vietnamese snacks for purchase.  There is no where to really sit and enjoy the food on site but  it's easy to walk a couple of blocks over to the Civic Center for a nice outdoor picnic.\n\nThis is a great, filling meal for less than $5, is relatively healthy and will not leave you in a food coma.", "author": "Melissa L."}

Most of their sandwiches are under $4, which is a great price compared to a lot of banh mi places in the city, and an especially great price for a sandwich nowadays. Bummer that they don't accept cards. Cash-only is inconvenient, but for $4, I guess I can't complain too much.\n\nOn a weekday afternoon, I picked up a Thit - Roast Pork Sandwich, and a Thit Cha Pate - Special Combination w/ pate, roast pork, ham, both of which were topped with pickled carrots & daikon, jalapenos, and lots of cilantro. The French baguette was lightly toasted and crunchy. There was a good amount of meat and pate. I could distinctly taste the sweet and savory flavors of the pork, as well as the pate, unlike some banh mi that just have a light smear of pate and the flavor fades into the background. If I could change one thing, I'd use less cilantro, or at least take the leaves off the stalks, so the celery-like texture doesn't interfere with the sandwich.\n\nI don't usually factor in location, since good food is good food, no matter where you are, but you're pretty likely to run into some people on the street who are not all there. You know, people who are talking to themselves, or going off on an incoherent rant, or who seem to be yelling at you, at themselves, or no one in particular. \n\nLuckily, I didn't have to deal with their weekend lines. There were only a couple of people ahead of me. The space is no larger than a takeout counter, so when a line accumulates, it can easily go out the door. \nIf you're in the area and there isn't a long line, and in need of an inexpensive & satisfying banh mi on the go, Saigon is great for that. However, if there is a line, the sandwiches are not a must have. In fact, there are quite a few other banh mi joints nearby that are a pretty decent substitute as well.", "author": "Joy W."}

When I asked about it she said, oh, you don't want any meat?  I ordered a tofu sandwich without brown sauce, I think it's safe to guess I don't want any meat.

The thing I love about this meal is it is always cheap (prices have gotten up by a quarter but still cannot beat a meal under $5!).  But this particular sandwich has all the parts done right that make a great banh mih.  Let's start with the bread, it needs to have that crunchy outside but when you bite into it, it's nice and chewy and the bread can hold the contents.  The bread is toasted in the oven that provides that nice crunch.  Next part of the sandwich, the meat.  I have tried both the chicken and pork and both are great grilled meats and they put so much in there, you can easily take some out and make a mini one for a snack later!  The other part of banh mihs that I love is the pickled vegetables and their pickled veggies definitely are one of the highlights of the sandwiches.  They lather a combination of mayo and a sauce that is similar to teriyaki, this glaze definitely adds to the flavor of the whole sandwich.

Nonetheless, I had been meaning to try Saigon Sandwich for a while now, and being so close to where I was staying, I felt I had to pay a visit.\n\nThe special combination (roast pork, pork loaf, and pate) banh mi is absolutely delicious. A freshly toasted baguette, stuffed with tender roast pork, with a generous spread of pate, and finally stuffed with thinly-sliced carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro. The crustiness of the baguette, the softness and chewiness of the meat, and the crunch of the vegetables all come together for a great and filling meal. You know it's good when the juices are running down your arm and you just don't care. You have to think about how quality the ingredients might be, but since the sandwiches are so tasty, it's easy to forget that you might not be getting the absolute best pork/bread/vegetables available in SF.\n\nVegetarians can also come for the tofu banh mi, which I was told was delicious as well. The couple ahead of me told me that they swore by the tofu banh mi for years, so that's gotta stand for something.\n\nAs for service, the ladies behind the counter aren't the friendliest in the world, but they do work incredibly efficiently, churn out sandwiches like clockwork, and are surprisingly patient with special requests, so that's really all you can hope for. Also, there is no questioning that the value is outstanding. For a fully loaded banh mi, I'd expect to pay about $6-8, but almost all banh mis are about $4, which is absolutely unheard of in this day and age. I'm not complaining at all, but it's crazy! I have a hard time finding no-frills banh mi in New York, and even the less expensive places are at least $8-10 for a sandwich.

It was raining cats and dogs, so thankfully there wasn't a long wait at all. The banh mi are mostly $3.75 each, although there are a few other banh mi that are a bit more. Cash only, and tax is included in the price of the sandwich. It's a bit pricier than what I am used to paying for a banh mi (usually I pay around 2.50-3$), but the banh mi here are pretty gosh darn good. I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (also known as a b\u00e1nh m\u00ec thi.t nu*\u00f3*ng), which was loaded with meat and pickled veggies, and laden with a rich, thick meaty 'dark sauce'. Usually banh mi is accompanied with Maggi sauce, but their 'dark sauce' was definitely something... something out of this world! The flavor, quality and dense packed nature of the banh mi is definitely worth the $3.75.  \n\nAs described by previous reviewers, Saigon Sandwich is a take-out kind of place.  First of all, you're likely going to not be able to sit down and eat as there is limited seating (two seats only!) and table space. There are also no bathrooms either.  Secondly, homeless tend to stand outside of Saigon's doorway.  They don't bother me, but it was a little sad/uncomfortable eating my sandwich inside Saigon Sandwich knowing they were probably hungry as they saw me and others eating away.\n\nLastly, there happened to be a few sparrows that were seeking refuge inside Saigon, probably to keep dry from the pouring rain and to try to find some food scraps to eat. These sparrows were definitely NOT shy -- one of the sparrows actually crawled and flew on my hair and then later climbed and crawled onto my leg. I always thought sparrows looked cute, but this one was pretty bold. It was definitely SPARROW VS. MAN.  Who would be able to win for the last bite of banh mi...sparrow or man?  While I do love mother nature and the great outdoors, it was kind of annoying having to guard/shield my food so it wouldn't be eaten by the sparrow.\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.

It isn't the best that I've had but the price for the place makes it still worthwhile.\n\nI got the tofu sammich and the combination to try things out. The tofu was good, it was marinated well which gave it a good flavor. I personally like when there are other things aside from tofu though. The combination was good, but not great. Other combination sammiches that I've had I liked the combination of the meats better. Overall for the veggies, there were lots of carrots and a good amount of cilantro. Always a fan when there's ample cilantro since some places skimp. I kinda wish there was a bit more daikon but that is just personal preference. Things were pretty well balanced between the veggies and the sammich topping.\n\nThe price is certainly good for the area, I'll probably consider coming by again. As per usual, it is hard to find a place with a veggie banh mi that I can add egg to but those are few and far between really. This will probably become one of the go tos if I stay here longer.", "author": "David C."}

MMMMMM!\n\nThe combination special includes a generous portion of chicken, pork loaf, pate, and the usual pickled veggie culprits. Proteins were spot on... juicy, flavorful, and overall good eats. But beyond that, a few other things stood out as well. I liked that it wasn't too bready. Whereas some banh mi joints tend to leave a lot of the bread crumb intact, Saigon Sandwich does right by the customer in taking it out. Also, the picked veggies are julienned much thinner than your standard banh mi joint. It was a welcomed change in texture providing just enough fresh crunch, but not too much. \n\nFor four bucks and some change?

I'm a real skinflint, so I make sure never to pay any more than I have to.\n\nHere are some helpful tips to avoid overpaying:\n\nDon't put any money into the parking meter (if you're driving).  It's around $3.50/hr to park in the area, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes to wait in line and get your sandwich, which means you'll need to put approximately $1.00 into the meter, transforming your $4.00 sandwich into a $5.00 sandwich.\n\nDon't get a parking ticket for refusing to put any money into the meter.  Your $4.00 sandwich will become an $82.00 sandwich.\n\nDon't give money to any of the numerous crackheads loitering about.  If you get spotted handing one of them a dollar, another one will approach you, and then another, and so on, and before you know it, you've just given away like $5, increasing the cost of your sandwich to $9.00.\n\nDon't get mugged.  Your $4.00 sandwich would then cost $4.00 + the contents of your wallet/purse.\n\nDon't purchase a handi-j or a blow-j or a quickie from one of the streetwalkers in the area.  Your $4.00 sandwich would then cost $4.00 + $5.00 + the cost of an AIDS test.\n\nEnjoy your $4 banh mi and be safe out there!", "author": "Warren L."}

When I walked by, I saw it had quite a crowd of people lined up to order, as well as a scatter of people waiting for their food.  I was a bit shocked to see the interior with 4 Vietnamese women quickly working in a b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich assembly line.  It didn't look like very sanitary conditions, but I still ordered a roast chicken sandwich for $3.75.  \n\nI was worried it would take a long time to get my order, but it was pretty fast (5-10 minutes).  I could see this getting out of hand with a lot more people because when I placed my order, the lady just wrote down my food without my name or without me even paying.  Then, she just called out \"one roast chicken.\"  I had to look around to make sure it was my actual order and then paid.\n\nThere is a small area at the front beside the cooler with two chairs you could sit and eat at, but with all of the people crowding inside, I wouldn't recommend this.  There is no seating outside, as well, so it's more of a \"take-away\" sandwich shop sort of thing.  When opening the wrapping to the sandwich, I saw how messy it was put together.  I wouldn't have minded waiting a bit longer if they made it less messy.  The bread was a bit too hard for me, and I can see it hurting the top of people's mouths when biting down.  \n\nOverall, the sandwich was ok, but you can't really complain about that price.  I think that's the only reason why this place has such a high rating.  I eat a lot of b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches personally, and this place definitely was not matching what Yelp had me believe it should be.  Maybe I came on an off day?  I'm highly disappointed to read on Yelp that this is the best b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich in San Francisco; that's unacceptable.\n\nWhat I ordered:\n-Roast Chicken B\u00e1nh M\u00ec Sandwich ($3.75)\n\nPros:\n-Very inexpensive\n\nCons:\n-Sketchy neighborhood with many homeless people\n-Looks unsanitary in the interior\n-Messy sandwich\n-Bread is too hard\n-No comfortable seating area (take-away only)\n-Confusing ordering setup", "author": "Justin A."}

There are only a few seats by the window in the building - most of it is take out.\nThere are some tasty snacks, canned drinks, and viet desserts laid out at the counter.

It comes with a generous serving of meat, jalapeno, carrots, cilantro and some mayo.\nIt was a solid sandwich, and also a decently large serving. In FiDi, people would pay $10 for this.\nSome things I wasn't ecstatic about was the 'fancy ham' that they used - not sure what it was but it was a bit dry - and the pate which overwhelmed everything else maybe bc they were a bit too generous with it lol.

This has occurred on several occasions so far.  I'm not sure why this happens but I have a simple theory:  they're running low on chicken, but there's enough pork left to make all the sandwiches and help who's next while additional chicken meat is being prepared.  Or possibly they want to conserve their supply of chicken because it costs more than pork?  \n\nI don't really know, but I know pork when I eat it.  It's ok, I'm not a big complainer and have no religious or other reasons keeping me from eating pork, but it should be known to anyone who does have holdups with the pig meat. \n\nOk. Now that that's out of the way, this joint makes the best Vietnamese sandwich I've had and there are plenty to chose from in SF.  Love the raw, hot peppers bringing the heat, nicely in contrast to the sweet shredded carrot.  The meat is always fresh due to the steady business throughout the day and the glaze (or whatever it is) sets up like a sweet barbecue condiment in the bottom of a more than decent, quarter french baguette.  Sometimes that bread is chewy but usually with a bit of crispness.  You get crunch, tanginess, chew and both kinds of heat all in one sandwich.  Many sandwiches are far more plain for more money.    \n\nThe neighborhood can feel a little shady.  This comes from a born and raised SF native.  That stretch of Larkin, Polk, Eddy and Ellis always felt that way.  Like something was going down nearby, or was about to.  If you feel unsafe in that kind of setting, bring a friend or two.  The payoff is a great sandwich.\n\nAs I typed this, I just finished a Saigon sandwich (chicken..) and have another in the fridge awaiting a test for the other white meat.

It's a simple menu that's cheap and executed really well.\n\nOf course I opted to get their combo. The meats were good and the bread was the right amount of crunchy exterior into that soft bite. What makes their sandwich great is probably the generous amounts of pate and that mayo based spread. Like some people said, definitely great to eat that day but not great for saving in the fridge. \n\nA couple tips: It's cash only if you're not prepared. There was a decent amount of metered parking when I went but you might be forced into a garage during the busier rush. Also in typical Tenderloin fashion, watch out for some of the homeless crazies around. One happened to bum rush the tip jar with $2, as the ladies behind the counter busted out their taser to no avail. \n\nTo the contrary of my personal friends and many Yelpers, I don't think this is the uncontested best banh mi in the Bay, but I will say it's a contender.

More like the eating experience of a bombtastic banh mi sandwich from Saigon Sandwich--so good, it'll be eaten before you can even drive away. \n\nDespite a line, the husband and I waited no more than ten minutes to get our sandwiches due to the super fast assembly process - one lady takes people's orders through the whole line and the two other ladies start punching sandwiches out as she calls the orders back. Because of this, it's really hard to customize a sandwich (almost frowned upon really). Just make sure to add the pate as it doesn't come standard with the regular chicken or pork. The banh mis are made with juicy meats, fresh crunchy bread, not-too-sweet pickled veggies, Viet mayo, cilantro, and a way-too-spicy-for-me green pepper. $3.75 per sandwich was enough to fill me up for the rest of the day. \n\nIt is in the Tenderloin so be wary of those around, like the vagrants passing through with soiled pants bumming for change.

Located just outside Little Saigon, Saigon Sandwich offers cheap fulfilling sandwiches. \n\nThis is a small hole in the wall place where sanitation seems a bit questionable. They only accept cash and offer many other snacks and drinks in addition to bahn mis. Each sandwich is $3.75 and filled with a creamy white sauce, pilled with meat, and topped with cilantro, jalapenos, and pickled carrots. My general complaint with bahn mis is that the bread often is a little too crunchy and there isn't enough \"stuff\". And while bread comment still holds, these sandwiches were so large that it was hard to get a good bite! The roasted pork was also very juicy and started leaking through the paper it was wrapped in and the paper bag the sandwich was put in. That's a pretty good sign to me. However, I would suggest grabbing a lot of napkins and maybe not eating while walking. I ended up dripping on myself and struggling to take bites while walking through the TL.

It has gone downhill with the new menu board a couple years back.  I remember having the wife run in and getting 4 sandwiches, all \"NUMBER ONE\"S\".  Number one use to be dac biet, it should be dac biet, fancy pork, headcheese, ham and pate but it changed, we got 4 roasted chicken sandwiches, WTF.  I think the American folks jacked up this place so bad that they had to change dac biet number one into roast chicken.  Hella whack.  I have been eating banh mi since elementary school with little paris in chinatown.  This stuff ain't new to me, but having roast chicken be number one pisses me off.  My friend last week went and got a sad ass looking sandwich that had no pickled vegetables or mayo, WTF WTF.  He said his sando got switched.  Damn I say to myself, these foo foo Trader Joe's shopping hipsters really did a number to this once upon a time my favorite banh mi shop.  Pickled daikon, carrots, fresh cilantro and jalapenos, is the heart of a banh mi including extra dirty greasy mayo and pate, A MUST, TAKE NOTES***.  If your banh mi doesn't have these items together or you don't like them, just go whole foods deli and get a turkey avocado on wheat.  If Saigon allows their customers to have no veggies and no mayo on a banh mi, I just lost all respect for them.  Its not always about making money, you need to keep the pride and passion to teach the world how banh mi should be and not let them manipulated it into a subway sandwich.  I mean having roast chicken or roast pork is fine, at least include all the veggies, mayo and pate, otherwise it ain't no banh mi.  I'm done with this place.\n\nP.S. - For the folks who eat organic, all natural, locally grown, gluten free, no MSG, NON GMO, yea you probably won't find it here and also it won't help altering your sandwich, just take it as it is.

Salty loves to play volleyball.\n2. Salty loves to look at girls who play volleyball.\n3. Salty might not even like volleyball, he just goes for the girls (pending verification).\n\nAnd that's why Saigon Sandwich is the perfect place for Salty. \n\nTo start, a Viet Sandwich here is packed with nutrients, ideal for a volleyball player. The chunk of BBQ pork has enough protein to build those calves necessary for a fiery jump serve. The toasted baguette provides the carbs needed for that 5th set game point situation. And of course, the spicy jalopeno is sure to give Salty the jump to dive for a crucial loose ball. Forget the gatorade, pack a Saigon Sandwich in your duffle! \n\nSaigon Sandwich is also perfect for Salty because the whole sandwich only costs $3.75. Yeah, that's cheaper than a Subway foot long. That means Salty can save more of his dollars for when he takes one of the volleyball gals to a fancy date. This is especially important since taking them girls to Mickey D's may result in a spiked volleyball straight to his face.   \n\nSure, the sandwich can be a bit dry and the pork kind of bland, but think of all the benefits that Saigon Sandwich brings to Salty. It replenishes him as a volleyball athlete AND it keeps his wallet from depletion on a date with a volleyball girl. The benefits most definitely outweigh the cost (esp since its only $3.75).\n\nMe and Vegg are gonna each grab a vegan Saigon Sandwich to watch Salty play volleyball one day.

I was so excited to eat here during my trip to SF and I had pretty high expectations from the raving reviews. But sadly, they weren't met :-/\n\nMy friend and I got the roast pork and roast chicken for a total of $8. Super cheap! I took my first bite but it was just the bread part which was a bit chewy and didn't have a particular taste. I eagerly took my second bite with the meat but was a little disappointed again. The meat was also a bit chewy and wasn't juicy/flavorful like I expected. The veggies were pretty good though. My friend loved it so it was really just personal preference.\n\nEverything is to-go since there is no seating area. Go early because there will be a long line. But they prepare the sandwiches rather quickly so you won't wait too long either way.\n\nI haven't tried that many banh mis before so I'm planning to restore my faith in them.

My typical banh mi order at any sandwich place is a grilled pork and/or BBQ pork, and a traditional/house special (usually headcheese or pig ear, ham, and pate). The worst of these here was the BBQ pork which literally tasted like it was smothered in a bad American BBQ sauce (bad as in super pronounced taste of ketchup). The meat was so soggy it drenched the bread in minutes, defeating the point of using fresh crisp baguette.\n\nThis in addition to my first experience here, where in the mid afternoon they ran out of bread and asked if any of us in line would go buy them bread from Lee's.

Yet I didn't get a chance to try their inexpensive, though very deliciously satisfying sandwiches until recently. One reason I've stayed away for so long is the fact that Saigon Sandwich is in the Tenderloin.\n\nThe menu is simple: fancy pork, roasted pork, roasted chicken, pate, combination, or tofu. The fancy pork is generally my favorite and must-order meat at Vietnamese sandwich shops. But Saigon Sandwich's roasted pork was very good as well, though a bit too fatty. The meat portions are fair, but the pickled carrots and daikon radish are plentiful with a very mild acidity to them. All of these ingredients stuffed in a fresh, flaky, and crispy baguette is the prefect quick meal.\n\nSandwiches are priced at $3.75 as of November 2013. It's slowly increasing, but it's still reasonably-priced and affordable. The shop also sells desserts and chips you'd typically find at Asian supermarkets. The two female workers are quick with prepping your orders that even if there's a daunting line trailing out of the hole in the wall shop, you'll reach the front of the line shortly and your hunger will be quickly satisfied.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I have to say, I've been to Saigon Sandwich 3 times, and every time it's consistently in the top 3 banh mis I've ever eaten.  It's at the #2 spot on my list, just under Banh Mi Huynh Hoa in HCMC (EDIT: The address is 26 Le Thi Rieng in D1 if you are ever in the area).  Keep in mind that the price point here is pretty amazing when you consider the best in Vietnam costs ~$1.50 and here in downtown SF it's $4.25.  Economically, this doesn't make sense. \n\nThe bread is so crispy/fluffy, the ingredients are both fresh and plentiful, and the ratio of vegetables to meat to bread is spot on.   The pate itself is nice and doesn't taste cheap, and it's a nice compliment to the heat from the fresh jalapeno.  The waiting time is almost non-existent, even though they are making it fresh, right in front of you.  Other places in the area pre-make the main part of the sandwich, pop it in the oven, and throw some fresh greens on - BOO to them.  The staff here are always friendly to me, and I've been here when there's no one and when it's packed.  In any case, this is a place where if you're a regular, they'll treat you like one.\n\nNext time I'm trying something different - maybe a roast chicken banh mi.  These are even good the next day, just pop them in the toaster oven to crisp it back up!  \n\nJust be careful getting here, you probably should come up from Market St if you haven't been around the Tenderloin much.

Saigon sandwich tasted like Lee's Sandwich and that place is yummy as well so four stars for all of them. I came here around 10am to get take out for lunch and there was no line when I got there. Surprisingly a small line formed at that time but they get you in and out of there so quickly. We had a big order that consisted of about 10 sandwiches and even though they rushed our asses, they were able to take our order, tender our cash and make them within ten minutes. The location of the place is in Tenderloin so it totally felt sketch but thank goodness it was during the daytime.\n\nI got the pate sandwich but since there is no meat in that, I added chicken so it cost $4. Pate is this goopy, thick sauce that adds a thick layer to the sandwich. I cannot imagine someone just ordering a pate sandwich so you definitely have to add a side of meat. Honestly, I hated that nastiness. It is some weird layer of leftover meat grinded up and compounded into paste form. I just imagine it to be the paste version of balogne cause I am almost positive the disgusting leftover body parts of intestines and animals are in that goop. My friend got the classic pork sandwich so I was able to get half of hers. I am so happy that she didnt listen to Yelp and got the pate as well. I scraped off the pate off of mine and ate the chicken. The chicken was bleh but the pork is the way to go. \n\n**TIPS**\n1) Cash only.\n2) Know your order ahead of time because they rush you like crazy.\n3) NO PATE.

Looks like a fairly miserable place to enjoy such a delicious sandwich as everyone is hovering over and behind you.

I ordered one with chicken, without jalape\u00f1os. \n\nFirst, let me just say I'm amazed that the woman who took the orders is so organized! She took everyone's orders, made the sandwiches, called out the orders, and then took the money without any errors! I was afraid she'd add the jalape\u00f1os on mine since she was going so fast. That wasn't the case. \n\nAnd the sandwich was delicious! The chicken was dark meat, so it was tender. And the sauce was flavorful that went well with the pickles daikon and carrots. It was messy to eat as everything was crammed in but it was so good! The only minor complaint I have is the bread... The ends of the bread were hard so it was difficult making the first bite. But once you get to the middle, the bread is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. \n\nThe place is small with a very limited seating area.

I grew up with it. I enjoy it. The bread rips the roof of my mouth and its aftermath pops off dress shirt buttons.  Saigon sandwich is in a league of their own in the sandwich game and they have over 2,XXX cultish reviewers to prove it. \nThe outside is anything but impressive; faded blue awning, dirty large window, a homeless guy pissing on your car, etc. Once you get past the exterior, you are greeted by a small and cozy(?) interior filled with people and Asian snacks. Max capacity may be 7....or 8 on a good day.\n\nOkay down to the nitty gritty, this isn't your typical Vietnamese joint in the TL. You don't have a huge menu... they give you just a few choices. I call it the in-and-out menu approach (and Ill translate for my fellow mi trang):\n\nBanh Mi Ga (roast chicken)\nBanh Mi Thit (roast pork)\nBanh Mi Xiu Mai (meat ball pork)\nBanh Mi Cha Lua (fancy pork, pate)\n\nMy favorites: \nBanh Mi Thi Cha (combo steam pork and roast pork)\nAnd....the holy grail. \n\nBANH MI CHA PATE (special combination....no questions asked, or we will have to kill you off). \n\n Ladies and gents, if 2000+ reviews, 300+ pictures and obesity in the good-ol-US-of-A at an all time high doesn't convince you....

I most recently tried the chicken banh mi, and while they gave a good amount of chicken, it looked old and as if it had been sitting there for a long time. The chicken was a dark brown color and had a slightly mushy texture.

On an especially warm day, my brisk trek was overflowing with characters more savory than the accoutrements I'd eventually meet in my sandwich. But that's really a side note - my point is that you should exercise caution, be alert and stay off your phone (especially if you're a woman going at it alone). \n\nLike most legit banh mi shops, this one is tiny. There's a counter for ordering, a straight-to-the-point menu featuring five phenom sandwiches (with their English translations), a cooler containing sugary favorites such as Fanta (*cheers*), teas and the like, a steady line usually comprised of a dozen hungry denizens, and room for about one average-sized person to dine-in. \n\nI am the 1% - or more accurately in this case, 'the one' - lucky enough to snag the lone seat. I set up shop in the small quarters, mostly because I couldn't bear devouring the much-lauded sandwich a moment past its ideal state. And I'm glad that I stayed, because my banh mi had it all - succulent roasted pork, carrots, radish, daikon, cilantro, jalapeno peppers and a spread of mayo - all housed within freshly-baked bread. Soft but crusty, chewy and delicious, this bread served as the springboard of the consummate banh mi sandwich.\n\nFor $3.50, I had a lovely meal that proved to be perfectly-portioned for my lunchtime (read: lighter) appetite, but may be a tad smallish for some.

They did give me lots of veggies which was a plus. The sandwich did have lots of mayo in it.

The lunch hour wait can be brutal, as there are practically lines out the door every day. It's all happening in the name of a $3.50 sandwich, made in a place that doesn't even have seating and closes at 6PM every day. Those who are hanging out in line know the deal: this is killer banh mi that is worth the wait.\n\nSaigon Sandwich has the luxury of being located in the seedy Tenderloin, home to the \"Little Saigon\" hood of SF, where crazy hobos and dive eateries go hand in hand.  The menu is notoriously simple, located on a green board on the upper right hand side of the wall, with thit (pork), xiu mai (meatball), and ga (chicken) listed as their main proteins. Chay (tofu) is also available, though not listed is dac biet (special combination), which happens to be the one I order almost every time.\n\nThe sammy seems a bit on the smaller side, but taste more than makes up for it. The bread is toasted almost perfectly, with a generous slather of pate, a gorgeous piling of pickled veggies, cilantro, daikon, peppers above a stuffing of choice. Whatever the filling, it's makes for the perfect lunch under $5.\n\nThere are other Vietnamese snacks available at the counter, but the sandwiches steal the show. The ladies are super nice, though are pretty sparse with the English outside of money and menu words.

There was a bit too much mayo for my liking, but I have a fundamental disagreement with that condiment. And I generally find the baguette to be a little on the tough side, even after being toasted. The wife kept complaining about how short this bahn mi was in comparison to the generous portions they serve in just about every shop in Oakland, at half the price, with superior flavor. \n\n***ROASTED CHICKEN SANDWICH\n\nAs I mentioned, the flavor of the meat was very subdued, so much so that I honestly would've had a hard time telling the difference between this and the pork sandwich.

What's more amazing is their TOFU VEGETARIAN BANH MI that I've fallen in love with! YASSS the tofu veggie banh mi was bomb! The marinated tofu slices were packed with flavor and incredibly moist, topped with a shiiii ton of picked carrots, jalapenos that created a bit of heat, tangy mayo, fresh cilantro and cucumber.

Cashier, just a few feet from the door, with a bunch of snacks laid out on the counter, the open kitchen just behind, then two fridges on the right for drinks you can check out, counter overlooking the window with two chairs. Ordering and getting your sandwich ready to go will take relatively 15 mins max. because the ladies who sell over there have perfected their sandwich making production line so you can be in and out of there in time for some coffee at Philz nearby and back to whatever important things you need to get down in the day.\n\nWANT.

This kitchen + counter + mini grocery store is nothing to sit and take in.  It's just two hard working vietnamese women furiously and artfully making vietnamese bahn mi sandwiches.  \n\nFood: All of the components are clearly prepared upfront and so even though there was a long line, I didn't wait long for my tofu bahn mi ($3.75).  The tofu itself was fried in-house and well-marinated with soy sauce and I got some hints of ketchup I think.  The mayonnaise was definitely more sweet than tangy, which suggests it was also homemade.  Add your pickled carrots/daikon, cilantro, jalapenos and one of the best baguettes and this makes for an awesome sandwich.  I have to admit that the pickled veggies were a little tasteless, couldn't taste any vinegar and were more sweet than anything else and it would have been a homerun if they were just a smidge crunchier.  Nevertheless, together, this is one of the best tofu bahn mi's I've had.  I decided to go for the che ba mau dessert ($2.50) which is basically a tapioca sweet soup that they had in cups.  It was without question the best I've ever had.  It was the perfect level of sweetness and had a ton of different flavors.  The tapioca and beans were perfect and blended well with the soup portion.  This was the perfect on-the-go lunch.\n\nWould I come back again?  Absolutely although walking from Moscone was a bit far.  I might still make the walk in the coming days while I'm in town.", "author": "Thomas C."}

Just not super authentic (I've had my fair share of banh mi in San Jose / OC / Saigon / Hoi An).  \n\nOrdered the Thit Cha Pate (no mayo). Bread had a nice crunch to it! Good amount of meat (cha is like a Vietnamese pork ham) and well balanced with the amount of pate. This was the first time I've had a banh mi that had a sweet, Teriyaki-like sauce. Interesting and flavorful taste, but I personally prefer something more plain. I've also had more satisfying pickled veggies at other places -- this one seemed like 98% carrots, 1% daikon, and 1% onion. \n\nTry it out if you're nearby!

The grilled pork quality is above average, but the texture was more akin to pulled pork (very fibrous) and really lacked that unique bahn-mi spice and taste. It tasted like a generic pulled pork sandwich, which, don't get me wrong, was delicious, but I was looking for a little more zing to the sandwich. I think what contributed to this overall brandless flavor was the fact that their sauce was more of a plain mayo than whatever magic sauce I've had in previous bahn mi sandwiches.

I used to come here pretty often when I went to school in the neighborhood, and now that I'm not, I still find occasion to come here for the glorious, glorious creation that is the Saigon Sammich Tofu Sammich.  \n\nThat amazing, godly thing is stuffed to the brim with several delicious patties of fried tofu, all nice and fatty, marinated in this sweet, mayo-plus-something-else blend.  The result is a creamy, slightly sweet concoction that is filling, tasty, and perfect.  Add to it the standard banh mi condiments of cilantro, pickled veggies (carrots, daikon, and onion), and some jalapenos for you spice lovers, and you've got a sammich that is, IMHO, quite perfect.  The bread is also done just right - there's a crispy outside and a softer inside.  \n\nI think it's $3.50 or maybe $3.75, a very reasonable price for a VERY big sammich that will fill those with even the biggest appetites.  \n\nI've tried some of the other sammiches here, and they're good too, but I think the tofu sammich is the BEST item on the menu because it's unique, it tastes so good and perfect, and also because personally I'm more partial to vegetarian sammiches than meat ones.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Sandwiches are super cheap at only 3.75, that's unheard of especially in SF. Given that price, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly pleased. Each sandwich is about 10 in long, and stuffed with enough meat and veggies to keep you full. I ordered the chicken banh mi and the meat wasn't chewy, overcooked or full of disgusting chicken parts (you know when you order a really cheap sandwich and you get a mouthful of chicken skin, cartilage or tendon--I'm not a fan). There was also plenty of carrot, cilantro and jalape\u00f1o stuffed (a bit carelessly) into our sandwiches. I asked for some Sriracha and she really smothered it on there, so my sandwich was a bit too spicy. This place is good and I'll definitely be back, but I wish the vegetables were a bit more pickled.", "author": "Trena M."}

I had high, high hopes for this place because I've heard quite a few people talk this place up. Usually the only reason I'd be in this area would be for Brenda's and by then I'm too full to buy a sandwich, lol.\n\nOnto the review.\n\n$3.75-$4.25 for a sandwich.\nThe banh mi itself is probably the ONLY banh mi that has actually made me full. It's chock full of filling and the bread is fresh (not hard and stale/stratchy!). The ingredients are fresh (shiet, it better be with that long line!) It's a different tasting banh mi that I've ever ordered. I think it's the sauce they use- some kinda brown teriyaki-ish sauce which I don't think I liked. I prefer just mayo and pate. I like the taste of my usual ones better but that's just me. The price is on par with Sunset and Chinatown prices but it's definitely more filling. I'm not sure I'd crave this sandwich but that's subjective to me but I do see the hype!\n\nOne con was the ordering process. There was a long line but it appeared to be for people to receive their orders. I stood in front but the lady didn't acknowledge me with eye contact at ALL! I understand if English isn't your first language but body language is universal. I think they do their orders in batches. Iono. It was kinda confusing for a first timer. After the receiving line was done though she went straight to taking orders again and I prob got my sandwich in 3-4 mins. Total waiting time was 8 mins or so.\n\nLastly there are a bunch of viet desserts that also look pretty yummy to round off your meal.

For sure this place is better than Lee's...but at least makes baguettes in house and is toasty, but they are skimpy.\n\nBut I'm guessing their success is due to the fact they serve Sir Mixx A Lot sammies....because it's BIG and PLUMP.  Maybe that's why people love it so much. You like Big Banh Mi and Cannot Lie?\n\n2000++ reviews, so it's gotta be good right?\n\nOr maybe I just don't get it.\n\nThe cha lua banh mi was pretty good. Well toasted baguette. A ton of veggies inside, although I felt the vinegared carrots lost their crunch and character. The usual cilantro, jalapenos etc. But the most interesting thing was their....sauce. It was like some aspic....gelatinized broth/stock (either pork bone or chicken with soy sauce). It was really tasty. Maybe if that were heated up into some meatballs and wrapped, it could become some banh mi sauce xiao long bao. Not bad, but can't help but feel something was still missing.\n\nThe combo was a horrid mess. The baguette was insufficiently toasted. It seemed like the Vietnamese aunties and grannies (who also speak Cantonese) were trying to force feed the baguette with as much veggies as possible (if the baguette were a goose, I'd be having foie gras by now). There was quite a bit of pate , cha lua, roast pork. This is a monster at $4, but the combo had way too many flavors and textures...in some ways they were clashing. And it didn't help it started to get really soggy inside.  \n\nAte the cha lua sandwich first. Had I left it at that, would have been fine...but having the combo after that was an overload, and soured the experience quite a bit. Not the greatest move.\n\nThis is probably the first banh mi shop I've been to that did not have caf\u00e9 sua da (Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk). Doh.

And several times during the day as you go about your work, you are still thinking back to that particular session and fondly going over a few of the details in your head? Yeah, this banh mi was the sandwich version of that. After I devoured this thing, I couldn't stop thinking about how good it was and sort of wanting another but knowing that I was too full for it. So many details: the bread slightly crusty but soft inside, the fresh grated carrots, the cilantro, the slow roasted meats, the hints of vinegar somewhere in the sandwich, the slight sweetness coming from some sort of vegetable snuck in the layers, THE SAUCE. And the weird little jar of fruits and what seemed like grass floating in a cup that I got to drink with the banh mi. A perfect lunch. And a real treasure that I found through searching yelp for best Vietnamese food.\n\nOne suggestion: this is sandwich chaos here and it needs organization. There should be two lines. Left side to order, once you order move to the end of a line on the right to pick up. The way the sandwich pickup exists now is there are no names, numbers or other ways of figuring out which order is up, people just sort of mill about on the sidewalk not knowing who is next and sandwich thieves such as myself may accidentally grab and pay for what was likely someone else's order...sorry not sorry\n\n2018: tourists should know: this area is overrun with homeless junkies, so if you do not know where you are going, use car service like Lyft to get there and back.", "author": "Michele D."}

Cilantro and bell pepper were nice touches and the creamy mayonnaise mixed well with the sweet teriyaki hoisin sauce. \n\nSince they were closing, it was evident they sold the leftover ingredients I normally hold in high regard. The baguette was stone cold and harder than a San Franciscan brick, meaning it was just brittle enough to break with 90% of maximum force after the crust was removed like the shell of a hard boiled emu egg. The sauce moistened the inside of the roll, but failed to do so for the pork which had a texture similar to rehydrated cuttlefish moreso than cooked meat. \n\nI can empathize with why people like this place, but it took a lot of deep introspection as well as a new prescription of reading glasses for me to really see that picture.

The bread, rather than soft or too crunchy, was a perfect mixture of both.  The pate was spread generously throughout the sandwich and the roast pork was tender and delicious. \n\nIt's too bad this place is so busy or I'd order to-go orders everytime I drove by the area.

Tofu texture was something new to me, in a good way that while definitely nowhere near real meat emulated it better than regular tofu. However, I personally like my bread crunchier, and the carrots could have had more vinegar to them (and this is coming from a guy who normally doesn't really like vinegar). Those critiques seem inconsequential when you hear the cost: $3.75 including tax. You get a roughly 6-inch sandwich that is both more filling and cheaper than Subway's 6-inch, so even if you didn't factor the quality and the SF competition it would be a not too shabby deal. However, a non fast food sandwich in SF is normally going to be at least double the price and probably on average a little lower quality.

Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI stopped by here while biking through the city, and after eating my roast pork sandwich I had to go back to get another one for the road. They heap your roll with mountains of pork, and with the addition of cilantro, peppers, carrots and some sort of magic sauce you will wonder why you don't live right next door so you can have this sandwich for every meal.\n\nThe shop itself is pretty small and takeout only. While making each sandwich is pretty fast, they usually don't have more than 1 or 2 people manning the counter at any point in time. So be prepared to wait a bit during rush hours. They also have different selections of meat (chicken, meatball, fancy pork) that completely change the taste of the sandwich (since it is already so simple). Try them all out!", "author": "Dennis R."}

The french baguette is fatter than usual, toasted to obtain that chewy and just-on-the-cusp-of-crunchy texture, and filled to the brim with roasted pork and pickled veggies. Packed with so much thinly sliced tender pork, my banh mi could barely fit the pickled carrots and dikons, both of which added the perfect crunchy texture as well as a refreshing sourness to the sandwich.\n\nMy cilantro and jalapenos were abandoning ship though, and I had to coerce them back to their rightful places with some forceful jabs. The jalapenos added a touch a heat. I didn't have too much cucumber or dikon in mine, but at 3.75$ who am I to complain? The only suggestion I have is to skip the fancy pork and stick with the actual meat items like chicken or roast pork or a combo.\n\nThough I had to take my order 3 times and still ended up with four banh mis instead of two...

The natural answer (at least for a man who is both broke, and has no conception of a proper American breakfast) is a Banh Mi, and thankfully Saigon Cafe opens at 7:30 (Banh Mi for breakfast?! Shut up, you stupid kids from a late 90's Cookie Crisp commercial.). Its a breakfast which costs less than a large cup of coffee from Philz right down the block ($3.75 as opposed to $4.00). Order something from both places, and savor the flavor of the paradox which is San Francisco, 2014. \n\nThe Banh Mi here aren't great, or awe-inspiring, but they certainly are good. A half-pound of slightly gristly, pre-prepared, mildly spiced (although a bit too sweet) dark meat chicken nestles within a crusty french roll, a generous (perhaps too generous?) slathering of mayo, pate, and fish based sauce enrich the meal with extra calories and (totally delicious) fat. An extra-spicy request simply results in more jalape\u00f1os, although its not like I'm complaining. Did I even see a perfectly pickled onion among the crunchy slivers of daikon and carrot? Casey dreams of onions: a story of a man and his gastronomic whims.\n\nI took the Banh Mi down to civic center plaza, the decaying faces of methamphetamine users juxtaposed against a backdrop of our staid and stately city hall; humanity's terrible beauty arrayed for all eyes to see. The crisp morning air bit as I bit into my crisp sandwich.\n\nOverall: A basic, but good sandwich at an excellent price. 3.5 Stars.\n\nExtras:\n\nService? They get you your food quickly. Who needs good service?!\n\nThe Muni Operator Exam: Easier than the LSAT, although I probably did worse on the former than the latter (Damn you customer service section!).\n\nIf I ever get married at city hall, I might have my reception here. \n\nTransit accessible by: various Golden Gate Transit Lines (Including the 92, 70, 101, and 80) MUNI, (5, 5l, 19, 31, and Van Ness/Market Street Corridor Bus lines), the Muni Metro, and BART.", "author": "Casey U."}

I came here pretty frequently especially whenever I go to farmers market or civic center. I think what makes their banh mi taste so good is the sauce and the generous portion of meat and pickled veggies. The pickled daikon/carrots gives just the right amount of crunch and acidity to the banh mi. I really want to give this place a 5 star but I think there is room for improvements, such as the cleanliness of their ''kitchen'' area and shelf, the organization of their counter and kitchen, and the way they store the baguettes. I saw a lady take out baguettes in a half opened bag that is placed on the floor pushed aside. She took the baguettes out and put it straight into the oven/toaster without gloves.

I arrived at the right time and only waited a few minutes before they took my order. The guy ahead of me had a very large order...\n\nI always like to get the best bang for the buck so I went with the thit cha pate (special combination) for $3.75. I chose well because the sandwich was so good that I am hooked. The pork was tender and full of flavor, the bread was just the right amount of crunchiness, and there's plenty of pate on the buns. They didn't skim on the ingredients and really packed the ingredients in. I also grabbed a che (cold drink) as well.

My short verdict on Saigon Sandwich: great value, pretty good sandwiches that are close to the real deal but fall a bit flat on the bread. \n\nI have a lot of sympathy for places like this. I feel there are good reasons to support a spot like Saigon Sandwich: 1. You get way better value here. $3-4 a sandwich 2. The sandwiches are generally closer to authentic. 3. You get to support an immigrant small business where they share some of their culture. \n\nBut let's talk about the sandwiches themselves. The meat is pretty flavorful, the pickled Daikon/carrots have the right mix of sweet and sour and crunchy, the cilantro and jalapenos are vibrant. \n\nThe one flaw here is the bread. It's too tough and dense. In Vietnam they make baguettes with a mix of wheat and rice flour. The result is brilliant: a crackling, crisp, thin crust with an airy, light interior. Not only is it a wonderful texture, it's physically better suited for banh mi, because if you have a chewier, denser bread like the one used at Saigon Sandwich, the act of biting into the sandwich compresses the inflexible bread, expelling the wonderful mix of ingredients and making a mess. If they changed up their bread, this would be a great banh mi. As is, it's pretty good. Food-wise: 3 stars; the value bumps it up to 4 for me.", "author": "Long L."}

This tiny market has been touted as having the best banh mi, and the line was already steady and long by the time I got there this morning. With a small two-seater by the storefront window, the structural layout of this Asian convenient store is adorned with snacks, candies and chips of all sorts. They have all the baseline banh mi choices to choose from, and my special combination ($3.50) was small in size but rich in flavor.\n\nI thought the warm and toasty bread had the right amount of crunchy texture but the edges were still a bit too sharp than desired. The quality of the pate was rich, pointed, and the texture was nice and creamy than dry. The rest of the filling included a juicy set of roast pork, steam pork, carrots, cilantro, and jalapeno slices. The roast pork and pate combination made the sandwich creamy and delicious, but I also thought the carrots could be pickled while the stack of jalapeno slices did not inspire. Fish sauce and pickled radishes were absent for it to warrant a five star rating.\n\nEven thought the antiquated setting and bustling ambiance may still render suspicions about its sanitary conditions, but their practice of keeping their baguettes heated while using gloves and tongs to making their sandwiches provided some level of respectability. Thanks to Tom for the solid recommendation. I will be back.", "author": "Daniel L."}

But this sandwich is definitely not from Texas, nor is it underwhelming nor small in any way. It is a perfect hefty size.\n\nHefty might be defined in terms of thickness versus length. Saigon Sandwich's bahn mi sandwich is larger than a burger and a little smaller than half a sub from Subway. Unlike a Subway sub, it makes up in VOLUME. While VOLUME, in phallic terms, is very important, the same holds true with sandwiches. You can have a really long veggie-filled baguette with delicious innards but if the sandwich isn't thick, I mean PACKED, spilling out from every angle, you can certainly enjoy it but it wouldn't be very impressive. I prefer both though. Like, the same holds true with the best of the best burritos. I want to hold a burrito the size of my foot and feel almost uncomfortable at the end. With this bahn mi, I want to have to catch every leaf, carrot, daikon, tofu spilling out and me catching it with my mouth and have sauce dripping all over because I don't feel uncomfortable at the end. There's no way a pickled veggie sandwich, unlike a burrito, can ever do this to me.\n\nThe freshly prepared and amazingly tasty fried tofu is something I cannot get enough of, as well as the incredibly fresh vegetables.

Oh yummy banh mi, why must you be located in the dangerous part of town? Little Saigon is smack dab in the tenderloin district (aka the \"TL\"). So I suggest getting your fix only during the day. \n\nChicken banh mi ($3.25) - ingredients are fresh, pate is savory, and they use REAL slices of chicken. Not that crap, cold stuff that Lee's has. The bread is softer here and they pack it with the right amount of stuff - lots of meat and veggies. EXCELLENT.\n\nThere's a line out the door..but it doesn't take long to get your order. About 10 minutes or so. No seating - just order and go. The ladies running this place are sweet, efficient, and work hard to make all those sandwiches for the hungry masses. I wish they had a receipt or number system so you know which order is yours. They just call out the sandwich that's ready - so just remember who was standing in front of you.\n\nI like to pair my sandwich with a trip to Quickly's down the street from this place. More so cause you have a place to sit and enjoy your meal..plus Quickly's has a tv to watch Friends or some show while you're eating, and offers sriracha sauce which I love plenty of on my banh mi! I'll save the rest on Quickly's in the TL for another review.\n\nOverall: 5. You can't beat the price. & that banh mi craving will definitely be fulfilled at this place!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-08", "description": "When I get a hankerin' for banh mi, there's not much I can do to convince myself to eat something different. I've seen some great executions of this humble sandwich, but not really in SF - until recently. In general, I look for three key criteria:\n\n1. Crunchy, perky roll\n2. Appropriately authentic ingredients (p\u00e2t\u00e9 is a must, cheese is a no-no)\n3. Even distribution of ingredients throughout entire roll surface area - if there is cucumber on one side, and pork on the other, you won't be seeing me in your shop again.\n\nSaigon Sandwich hits each of these, so I give high-ish marks for taste and delivery. However if I'm totally honest, I'd have to say that the experience overall is kinda stressful.\n\nThis is a tiny place, with standing room for only about 5 people; come prepared to contort your body as your fellow customers access the drinks fridge. At 11.30am there were already about 10 people in front of me, with a line snaking out the door, although I still got my roll within about 10 minutes, which isn't too bad.\n\nThe ambience is completely chaotic. There was one woman brusquely taking and handing out orders, and two other ladies putting the rolls together, while the phone rang continuously. There was a lot of shouting going on, and 80% of the people waiting were confused about how to order, where to stand, and which order was being called. Some people missed their orders because they were on their phones (fair enough), and one poor girl got so flustered by the experience that she paid and left the store, without her food. She then had to fight her way back through the wall of humans, her face aflame.\n\nAll that said, the banh mi is pretty good; the best I've tried in SF so far. The roll itself was properly crunchy, not one of those sad, hotdog bun-type breads that sometimes pass as banh mi. I had the combination with everything, including lots of jalape\u00f1os, coriander, and a generous smear of pate. It was very, very tasty.\n\nI would do a lot of things for a really good sandwich, so the poor experience of actually being in the shop won't stop me from going back. But based on what I saw, I think the best way to go would be to figure out what you want ahead of time, phone in your order if you can, and get in and out of the shop as quickly as possible.", "author": "Lauren D."}

The baguette had a nice crunch, but not so crunchy that your mouth is shredded by the time you're done.

Hence the 3.  On my scale where Lee's get a zero as in I won't even bother ever reviewing a Lee's since it's a cop out, Saigon Sandwich gets a decent grade.  But while I've had worse, I've also seriously had better.  The pork was was underwhelming.  Perhaps it was because of all the hype these reviews had that gave me too high of expectations.  But I swear I've had better roast pork sandwiches (albiet it was in SoCal).  And I'm not personally a fan of the pulled pork style...As for the meatball...completely disappointing.  Not quite sure what else to say than that.  Perhaps it's just not my personal favorite type of xiu mai sandwich (I prefer the ones with tomato sauce and some peas).\n\n3 stars isn't bad though...probably the best you can get in this area.

The french baguette bread they use for the sandwiches is kind of small, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in flavor, texture, and freshness.  As far as the sandwich fillings, I've tried and loved just about all of them: BBQ Pork, Meatball Pork, BBQ Chicken, and even the Tofu. \n\nFor the longest time, Saigon's prices were $2.00 and below, but slowly through the passage of time, their prices have crept up to closer to $4.00.  It is still worth the price, though.  Frankly, I was surprised at how they could have made much profit with their old prices.\n\nThey also have a good variety of other Vietnamese products, pastries, steamed buns, desserts, etc.  They have a custard flan, topped with a thin caramel syrup that is oh so yummy, too.", "author": "Danielle O."}

It's remarkably difficult to find a better price to benefit ratio, especially in a city as full of itself as San Francisco (see Out the Door in the Embarcadero for how to not do banh mi properly).  So for nothing else, the humility of a small banh mi shop in the Tenderloin can't get anything below a 4 star, for the sheer audacity of surviving without pretense in a city that sustains itself upon it.\n\nThat being said, there's nothing particularly remarkable about the sandwiches, but I guess that's the point.  The meat is plentiful, the sauces drippy, the bread nice and crisp.  You get the mix of savory and sweet that defines banh mi, weighted more towards savory.  It is good.The service is eh but who cares.

He was raving about it and said the sandwiches were cheap and delicious! He idled his car as I hopped in line. The line moved fairly quickly. The shop is tiny, but they seemed to have had a lot of snacks and few prepared items that probably many neglect. Everyone comes for the sandwiches! \n\nMy friend asked for a tofu sandwich as he claimed it was the best. I placed our order for two tofus and a pork and the total was under $10! I tried both and was quite impressed. Dollar for dollar, this is a steal! I thought the sandwich was a good size and it had incredible flavor! I will definitely be back!", "author": "Rebecca G."}

The roll - a rice flour french baguette roll - was fresh and delicious. The meat and veggies were hearty and plentiful, and the sauce they use is delicious and goopy.

I'm used to a #1 being a mix of meat and pate or head cheese. I tried a \"pate\" thinking it would be something like that...but no, just pure pate. The BF liked it, but it was too reminiscent of cat food in both texture and smell for me to get on board. The pork I had was quite nice though, hence the positive review. Slim pickins on nearby street parking; lots of transients in the blocks surrounding; no bathrooms, long lines and no chance of being able to sit down to eat at the 2 chairs stashed by the window.

For most people, one sandwich is more than enough to keep them full for a couple of hours.\nThe bread is crispy and fresh. The mayonnaise and special sauce give this sandwich a sweet taste.\nAmazing value for the 3.50 price.\nTons of other Vietnamese style goodies such as pastries, chips and drinks.\nFast wait time. I've never waited for more than five minutes for a sandwich even when the line was long.\n\n\nCons:\nThe customer service is pretty much non-existent. \nThey only take cash. I recommend you give them a 5 or 10 dollar bill because they also don't carry a lot of change.\nNowhere to sit. You can walk a couple blocks down and eat at the park or in front of the library.\nSuper small place.\nThe neighborhood is shady with lots of homeless people.

We ordered 2 sandwiches: the chicken and the Pork. \n\nHonestly, I was so skeptic with all these positive reviews of how this was the best banh mis sandwiches ever.  I mean, really how much better could you make a banh mi?  I'm from DC, with a large Vietnamese population and we have some pretty good banh mis over there already.  \n\nWe drove the scenic Highway 1 route, stopped took pictures and enjoyed the view.  Hiked up the Julia Pfieffer Park for almost 2 hours and my boyfriend (fianc\u00e9 a few minutes later!) decided as we reached the very top of the mountain that he was hungry and wanted to eat his banh mi.  Mind you, we were out all day, sweaty and dirty that I did not want to eat anything without washing my hand first, so I declined.  He shrugged and grabbed his banh out out of his backpack and started to go to town on it, saying how delicious it was.  I thought he was just hungry and even a rock would taste to him at this point so continued to ignore his comments, but the obvious happiness on his face - I just couldn't ignore that anymore.  He gave me a bite and it really was much better than any other banh mi I have tasted.  There is plenty of meat stuffed in and pickled vegetables, but it's really the marinated sauce that makes it so darn good.  I was surprised I didn't see the lady smear on any mayo on the sides of the bread, but it is just perfect the way it is.  Given the meat was cold and the sandwich itself was kind of mashed already from being at the bottom of a backpack, it is still oh so good.

If you've never had a vietnamese sandwich or  never had better, you'll love their sandwiches.\n\nThe problem is that they pack too much into the sandwich, which does not translate into better tasting -- but you definitely get alot for your money.

They also pack alot of meat/protein in there, which is great but it's salty.  There's also alot of mayo and sauce, which starts dripping in a messy way.

Like others have said, the neighborhood is not the best and there is often at least one panhandler hanging out outside, but it has never really bothered me much. My usual is the tofu sandwich, which is super yummy...and messy, so make sure you have plenty of napkins!\n\nI would also like to add for anyone who is a strict vegetarian (which I am not), this place may not be the best option. On a few occasions a little bit of pork or chicken has sneaked into my tofu sandwich.

Very well worth the walk. It was a Tuesday afternoon, around 12:30 PM. When I got here, there was already a line out the door, as usual. It took me around 20 min to order and to get my food. Let's just say I was underestimating the portions because I was very very hungry, so I ordered two: the special combo ($4.25) and the steam & roast pork ($4.00). I opted out of a bag ($0.10) and my wrists became sore after carrying these two heavy bricks back. \n\nOne was already enough to get me full. The ladies really do their best to stuff the sandwich full of meat and veggies. I'm saving the other sandwich for dinner.\n\nOne thing I would like them to improve on is to stuff the veggies in more evenly.

It wasn't even the best that I've had in San Francisco. \n\nMy favorite banh mi is roast pork with pate, but here the pork lacked flavor and the pate had some grainy characteristic that reminded me of cat food. The pickled veggies lacked tang and were overwhelmingly sweet. As a couple other reviewers noted, the bread, while warm and flavorful, had more \"chew\" than the crisp, airy baguettes I preferred in HCMC. \n\nDespite all this, the sandwich was decent, fresh, filling, and cheap, and squeezing in and out of the busy shop during lunch is an adventure in itself. I snagged a little pork-and-rice ball wrapped in banana leaf, which I ended up liking more than the sandwich. I'd be fine eating here again, although I don't expect to have Saigon Sandwich cravings, which is more or less what merits a 3 star review from me.", "author": "Monica S."}

Saigon Sandwiches gets 5 stars because it's absolutely delicious and great bang for buck. I've never been a huge fan of Vietnamese banh mih, but I think that's because I've only ever had it from Lee's. Saigon Sandwich does not skimp on the ingredients. They use fresh, crunchy French rolls that they stuff chock full of grilled and marinated chicken, beef, or pork (veggie option: tofu) as well as pickled carrots, daikon, onions, cilantro, and sliced jalapenos! I can't take the heat of the jalapenos, but even after discarding them, they still leave a nice spicy taste on the rest of the ingredients. Service is quick and attentive; they will pay attention to special requests such as \"No cilantro.\" For around $3 a pop, no wonder there is always a line out the door!\n\nI try to stop by here whenever I visit SF.

Why not treat yourself to another and make it dinner, too, for less than most lunches around town! The grilled pork is my fav, with somewhat of a bbq'ed flavor to it. The chicken is good, too; I wonder if they marinate in similar sauces? Their sandwiches are peppery and plenty spicy enough if you get the jalapenos.

Once you open the white paper wrapper, you'll see much food there is. It definetly was a stuffer! It was full of flavor. Levels of meat over meat and the pate sauce was amazing. You cool down from the picked veggies then you spice things up with the jalepenos. To be honest, I left satisfied and full.\n\nIt's these places that you find unexpectedly that are the ones who leave a long lasting memory! cheesy huh? I know", "author": "Clark Y."}

One sandwich would be a little on the small side for a grown man, but with a little something on the side would be fine.

Of course they are better fresh but are perfectly edible even a day or two after by gently heating in the microwave.\n\nThey are open at 7am 7 days a week so if you are a morning person you can go before work.

The trappings of this place are pretty bare, dare I say grimy, with 2 seats at the counter by the window for in-restaurant dining and enough space to fit maybe 4 people between the doorway and the counter where you order. The sandwich comes in a fairly thick roll, more bready than the other nearby shops (I'd actually preferred it if they hollowed out part of the inside) but I guess you need a roll of that size based on how much they fill it with.  The pork combo is overflowing with pork roll and pate with an acceptable amount of roast pork. While they pack the sandwich with meat, they unfortunately skimp out on the veggies as my sandwich was devoid of cucumber with no daikon to be seen either, and the carrots were minimally pickled (if at all). They sauce their sandwiches with a good helping of what I suspect is mayo and Maggi sauce which can ooze out dangerously between bites and cause an unsuspecting mess. If I was starving and looking for the most bang for my buck, I would choose this sandwich over the others based purely on the calorie to dollar ratio; if you're looking for a more balanced sandwich, I'd recommend checking out Lee's or L&G.", "author": "Gene C."}

I have never eaten a pork sandwich where the meat actually fought with itself. Allow me to explain. The roast pork was marinated sweet-style, but I could taste - two distinct kinds of sweetness - along with the natural flavor of the meat. As for the house special, the pate came on strong just like pate should before relenting to the more subtle flavors of the cold cuts.\n\nI do recommend eating these sandwiches soon after getting them.

Obviously its a take out place.\ni got a snapple with the sandwich and sat down and started into the incredible sandwich. With the first bite I realized why there was such a fuss over this place. Delicious with a capital\"D\".\ni put my drink down next to my sandwich and within 10 seconds I started seeing the bottle slide down towards the floor. HMMMMM, slanted counter? I guess so.\nThe two places and chairs for eating in was shared by a common counter that was joined at one end to form a right angle situation. i took my drink and tried it out on the \"other\" counter directly to my right. The bottle seemed to be much more secure and wasn't sliding down. Cool.\nWithin a minute the bottle slid down and fell on the floor. No breakage but liquid around me.\nThe owner came over with a broom and dustpan? (strange way to get the snapple off the floor) getting the puddle of it into the dustpan but leaving the area that i was sitting in and myself still with wet shoes and juice all around me.\nHer remark to me was \"it's ok\". No it's not OK. First of all WTF is up with not using a mop to get the sticky stuff off the floor as a consideration for customers that will come in. And secondly what about me?\nI kept eating, but this experience was on my mind taking away from the enjoyment of the food.\nI got up and got another snapple from the case that was right to the left of me.\nAfter a minute or two, the same person came over to me specifically to say \"You got another drink, you pay me\" I said \"I don't think so\". I sat there thinking about the fact that this place would not even spend a dime on fixing that counter (which was the cheapest one's I have ever seen.) It seemed so stupid to me that they wouldn't invest $40.00 max to just level it properly so that problem wouldn't keep recurring.\nWhen I finished, I stood up and sincerely asked if she wanted me to really pay for the \"extra\" drink. She said Yes. I mentioned that she should probably have a sign there that warns people about placing there drink on that counter. When I said that she seemed embarrassed by that statement in front of other customers that were standing in line. It seemed like against her nature to say it but did.As i reached in my pocket and pulled out a five starting to hand it to her she reluctantly said \"It's Ok\"\nThe sandwich could not be faulted despite my experience with yet again another greedy owner that doesn't have the business sense to procure regular customers by just treating them humanly and spending a very small amount of money ensuring their comfort. I guess that is what happens to politicians and restaurant owners: Power or success makes them forget their humble beginnings!\nit's sad to say that this is more the rule than the exception in the 44 years that I have lived in the bay area.\nAll that being said I WILL go back there, separating the wheat from the chaff, but next time its \"to go\"!!!", "author": "Jerry S."}

In Vietnamese, these sandwiches are referred to as \"Banh Mi\" (bunn-me), which literally translates to bread.

In what other town in the US can you see  a banker, a hippy, a  hipster, a homeless, and a tranny  all lined up outside the same eatery?\n\nReally, for selfish purposes, I was very reluctant to share this place. (The line gets long enough as it is.)  But since I do my best to not enter the heart of the city during peak commute and tourist times, I thought what the hell.  Plus they do serve one of the best sandwiches that I have ever had.\n\nI love the combination.  I use to order it with extra jalapenos, but they no longer agree with me.  However, it is still tasty and comes with canned pate, and uhhhhh, uhmmmm so other meat products.  Maybe processed chicken loaf?  Meat by product ham like meat substance?

They were afterschool lunches, treats for after the dentist (though now I don't know why), and all around comfort food. Then I went to Berkeley for four years, where the lack of good Asian food (with the exception of Indian and Thai food) is alarming. Luckily, I now live in SF where Saigon Sandwich exists right in the heart of the Tenderloin!\n\nRoast pork sandwich: This sandwich is freaking amazing. The meat is so, so tender and is still warm half an hour later. There isn't tons of seasoning on the pork, and it doesn't need it. The mayonnaise and hoisin sauce (?) complemented it so perfectly. I can eat this like every meal for the rest of my life. \n\nCombination sandwich: This is okay if you want some variety (comes with steamed pork, roast pork, and pate) but the pate isn't really as wonderful as I have heard. It's also this pink-colored liquidy consistency so kinda weird. It does add moistness to an otherwise dry sandwich.\n\nPrice: The most expensive one is the combo sandwich, and that's $4. Soooo yeah, a common theme I'm noticing is how most of my 5 star review are cheap, good eats. Gotta love that!\n\n- Bread: So the only complaint I have is the bread. I'm used to viet sandwiches on crusty, soft French bread. As mentioned in the reviews, this type of bread is particularly dense and heavy, which does lend to a drier sandwich overall. The one upside is that it prevents sogginess or chewiness if you're saving the meal for later. The first time I had the roast pork sandwich, I bought it at lunch and ate it for dinner hours later. It was still incredibly delicious after being out all day, and I would have still given it 5 stars then. \n\nThey have limited hours so keep note of that.

Good cuts of meat, I'm thinking pork shoulder since the protein strands were quite long. Not overly fatty like most places. Pretty lean stuff.\n\nSauce- Got the sando with no mayo, but the brown sauce was deeelish!  A bit too sweet though. I'm guessing they used a little fish sauce, some pork drippings, soy sauce, sugar, and maybe a tad of five spice or a dash of anise/cloves. Not too sure, but it was really savory. The taste lingered on my tongue for hours on.\n\nVegs- Meh. Not spectacular. I wish the pickled carrots and radishes were cut thicker. They were kinda soggy and bland, not doing much for the banh mi in terms of texture nor flavor. Thicker cuts would pack in a better crunch. Lots of cilantro, though. Jalepenos were legit. Good amount of heat that nicely contrasts with the sweet flavor of the sauce.\n\nBaguette- For me, the bread is what makes or breaks a sandwich. Saigon Sandwich's?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-13", "description": "Let's see, what can I really add to the already full list of reviews of Saigon Sandwich...\n\nWell, after being bullied by Lolia S. and Matt G. about not experiencing Saigon Sandwiches yet (this was back in early March), I....somehow didn't give into their comments until yesterday. Yes, I apologize, I've been slow in getting around to Saigon Sandwiches. I rarely venture around that part of town, but on Saturday night, perhaps luckily, I happened to stay over at a friend's place which happens by chance to be right around the corner from Saigon Sandwiches.\n\nSo, after getting up around 11:30am and sauntering out trying to find food in the semi-gritty neighborhood, I realized I was very close to the sandwich shop. I made it a point to go around the block and was greeted with a relatively short line. It seemed, at noon on a Sunday, there are quite a few Vietnamese who hit up Saigon Sandwiches. The ladies behind the counter were chattering with all the customers in front of me, and none of the words they spoke were familiar to me (side note: I'm convinced that most Vietnamese places in San Francisco are in fact owned by Chinese-Vietnamese, since I recognize the Cantonese they speak). So, already, the hype of the place was living up to itself with the fact that even Vietnamese themselves love Saigon Sandwiches.\n\nThe decor is plain, very plain: cramped with only two window seats (and nobody really seemed to actually eat in; they just sat down briefly to wait on their orders). The displays in front of the buns, Vietnamese desserts, snacks, etc. was a chaotic bliss to see; disorganized, but somehow customers are able to dig through and find what they want. There's a huge display of drinks to the right of the store, next to the counter: lots of Asian drinks and cold desserts inside.\n\nThe line at first seemed to move slowly, but after the ladies finished with a 3-sandwich order, one of them asked for the rest of our orders in line. With the amount of sandwich orders taken, I was only waiting for my sandwich for about 5 minutes at most. This lapse of time allowed for me to eye all the delicacies in front (what a way to make people buy impulsively!). \n\nThe selection of sandwiches was somewhat predictable (I mean, what I've seen at other banh mi shops): prices were quite a steal though. For $3, choose from the one-topping sandwiches; the most expensive (if you can even use that word here) sandwich was one of the combos (I think there was a combo), which still only topped out at around $3.50 or maybe $4. Still, it's very rare to find decent meals under $5 these days. I'm not sure of the other sides/desserts on display, but I decided to pick up a Banh Bot Ban (mung bean tapioca plate), which cost $1.50. For the sandwich, I went with Fancy Pork.\n\nThe ladies are efficient in what they do, I can tell you that. After I got my sandwich and paid, I walked out and decided to enjoy the sandwich over by the Civic Center. The pork was juicy and flavorful; I think I only found one jalapeno in my sandwich though, which was a little disappointing. However, no other real complaints on the sandwich--definitely a good deal. The dessert was not overly sweet and messy; use the coconut milk (comes in a small container) as a drizzly topping over the tapioca balls.\n\nIf I lived or worked around the area, I would go to Saigon Sandwiches much more. However, since I don't...well, it was nice to try it out anyway. My loyalties (in terms of banh mi) will lie with Cafe Dolci (at Grant and Market) for the time being, though.", "author": "Helene K."}

Very homey, cramped, and busy at 5p.  She's got a great attitude and it seemed like she gets plenty of business from her regulars who shout out their orders with a wave.  It's a bit irritating at first because you're wondering if she's got the previous orders memorized since she doesn't take notes...but you soon realize she's a pro.\n\nSo since she obviously had her system down, I was very excited to taste the food, so on to the food: We had the grilled chicken and grilled pork sandwiches with two mr. coffees and a bag of korean onion chips...all in all very yum.  The sandwiches are a bit smaller than where most places sell it, and I've had other places put picked veggies and pate in my grilled meat sammies so I was expecting it here :(  but other than that the flavors were all there, very intense so i only ate half of one.  The bread was very crispy and tore up the roof of my mouth and it wasn't too yeasty..so it was a toss up for me.  The flavor of the meat overwhelmed the taste of the bread so, eh.\n\nI'll probably be back when I'm in the area & craving a banh mi or wanting some cheap asian snacks or drinks.  I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way just yet...maybe I'll try her other sammies but until then, we shall see.  My rating would really be a 3.5", "author": "Blia L."}

Growing up the only Vietnamese sandwiches I ever tried was from Little Paris in Chinatown and I thought those were good until I tried this place. What I love is that they stuff it like crazy and aren't stingy about it. I've tried every single sandwich and my favorite is the combination. The mayo and the pate makes all the difference in the world. I came back here recently and the prices have gone up!!! It's been years so I shouldn't be surprised. Still a busy joint. Still long lines at time. Still a tiny tiny shop. There's like only one seating for two people at the most. Cash only. Hard to find parking. Hobos everywhere. Don't forget to pay the meter if you park on the streets on a weekday before 6pm. I brought my hubby here and he said the bread was too crispy and likes Lee Sandwiches better lol. We are both bias cuz he grew up eating that and I grew up eating this. I told him hey there's a Lee Sandwiches down the street. Overall, I love this place. The sandwiches have a unique taste to it that you can't find elsewhere. I also found a spot in San Jose that I absolutely love...so they are pretty much tided for #1 in my heart. Take the 19 Polk or 31 Balboa bus here. Or take the 47/49 Van Ness bus and walk. Or take the 38 Geary and walk. Many ways to get here by foot. Parking will be hard.

I ordered the pork and my companions ordered the chicken and the meatball. The pork was so dry and flavorless, I wondered if it was even pork. The meatball was a pink disgusting mess. The chicken was also dry. Perhaps the oh-so-popular tofu might have been better, but that would mean I would have to actually give my $3 bucks over to them again.\n\nThird, the veggie fillings. It was all carrots and almost nothing else. Minimal cilantro (I happen to love cilantro), minimal jalapenos (I also like a lot), no cucumber (typical of banh mi), no pickled radish...\n\nFourth, they didn't even give me pate. It isn't a banh mi without pate. \n\nPlease, save your $3. This place is a joke. If you want real banh mi, mosey on down to San Jose.

I've been trying to figure out exactly what is in their sauce by studying every flavor.....so far I've gotten oyster sauce, nutmeg, maybe plum sauce, then my mouth has an outer head experience and all logic is lost.\n\nI didn't fall as madly in love with their pate bahn mi (it didn't have their insanely delicious sauce on it from what I could tell, only mayo).  When I was there on Sunday 7/15 pate was still on their menu - not sure if they are still serving after the ban?  \n\nI love that Saigon Sandwich is open early - it is easy to drop by and grab a tofu extra spicy bahn mi for lunch (and sometimes a second for dinner!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-04", "description": "After tasting lackluster Vietnamese sandwiches in SoCal, I ventured here in search of the best Vietnamese sandwich of all time. Unlike other people, I enjoy a regular ham combo over roast pork. I like my ham very thinly sliced (the red kind with the black peppers) and my p\u00e2t\u00e9 the same way (with pepper). This place lacks both of those requirements so I already know it can't be the best Vietnamese sandwich ever, but this place does have some highlights.\n\nFor $3.25 you can get a ham sandwich with p\u00e2t\u00e9. I like how they include sweet onions, which gives the whole sandwich a nice taste. The other ingredient that I'm usually not used to is this type of sweet mayo (that's the only way I can describe it). I also like the French baguette, despite its small size. Add in the correct type of ham and some more cilantro and I think you have a winner. \n\nI also probably should have eaten this sandwich fresh, but I refrigerated it instead, then took it on a 4 hour-long flight (including wait times). By the time I ate it, it had been refrigerated for a good 4 hours and then sat at room temperature in my backpack for another 5 hours. It still tasted good to me aside from a few spots that were soggy, but good nonetheless. I don't think the flavor would taste that much different than from when I got it 9 hours ago. \n\nEDIT: Oh crap (literally). I think I feel the 9 hours of spoilage catching up to my stomach now. I guess p\u00e2t\u00e9 and mayo are best served fresh. Tasted fine, but ultimately was a bad idea. Still deserves four stars in my book since it was my fault for not eating it fresh.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

The self-righteous WASPy people in line who place their orders in English but try to pronounce \"b\u00e1nh m\u00ec tht\" using a Vietnamese accent.  GOOD GRIEF. You're not impressing anyone, and especially not the ladies behind the counter who honestly are just trying to get through the line and PROBABLY don't give a donkey's tail about how your pronounciation is.  Maybe I am just jealous, but gimme a break. \n\n2. The line, though nowhere near what I imagine Ike's to be like, has usually AT LEAST a 15-20 minute wait time during and around peak hours.   Once you get to the front of the line, the ladies working tend to be a bit rushed and pushy for obvious reasons. \n\n3. Being located in the heart of the Tenderloin, a pungent smell of urine subtly blankets the air in the area surrounding its coveted little street corner on Larkin and Eddy.  Decent ladies of society, expect to witness illicit drug deals in broad day light and inappropriate cat calls if the line extends out the door (which it probably will).  \n\nThat said, I love the crisp of SS's baguette and the perfect ratio of daikon to julienned carrots to pate and how the sandwich is small enough that I don't feel like a super fatty mcfatty finishing it all because it is DEEE-LISH-OUS.", "author": "Cecilia X."}

They're all that banh mi should be.  Perfection.  I get excited when I hear the word Saigon.  I wish I could give them 10 stars.  They are in a class by themselves.  Best ever sandwiches.\n\nThe way they hollow out the bread so that they can stuff more filling in is ingenious.  Their pickled carrots are so good that I think they could sell carrot sandwiches.  The quality of the roast pork is really incredible.  The prices are unreal.  The meatballs are the tastiest.  Every element of the sandwich feels like it was created to be part of that sandwich.  I can't even ask for more jalapenos or any alterations because the sandwich is already perfect.  \n\nWhenever I travel, I look for banh mi and I've not had one that has come close to Saigon.  I just wish they would open another location.  \n\nIf anyone claims that the banh mi elsewhere is better, it's clear that our tastes are just too different.  Saigon is the absolute BEST.\n\nUpdate (5/08):  They changed their bread.  It's longer now and doesn't hold the filling as well now.  There's less filling too.  They were so consistent for so many years.  The sandwich is still great but not as good as it was.  I am devastated.

I then got my quarters and asked if I could give her the four quarters for a dollar and she just turned her back and pretended to either not hear me or not understand me. On second thought, it is possible that she couldn't understand me. I was the only person there so I just sort of stood there amused for like two minutes seeing if she would turn around but she never did.\n\nOtherwise, I love this place!", "author": "Colin D."}

Yeah!!! \n\n'Twas a windy and chilly Friday afternoon in San Francisco when I met up with Robert L by Embarcadero and we took a little stroll into the TL for some b\u00e1nh m\u00ec. In true Ashley fashion, since first discovering that I had to try these yummy Vietnamese sandwiches of yumminess (thanks to yelp and, largely, everyone's sweetiepie, Ligaya), and since having my first b\u00e1nh m\u00ec in Richmond a few months ago, I've been a-hankerin', but very rarely fulfilling my desire. It's kind of like my sex life. But you don't want to hear about that, so suffice it to say that when Robert and I met up, having read the stellar reviews of Saigon Sandwich and hearing so much about their vegetarian sandwich, I knew that my fellow non-meat eater and I HAD to stop in.\n\nThis place would be easy to miss, a nondescript little storefront in the TL--except for the fact that there was a line out the door. Now, Ashley isn't one to wait in line for food, or anything else, but I was on a mission--and the line was fast moving. The two women behind the counter were taking order and throwing sandwiches together like nothing, quickly whittling the line down to acceptable size. \n\nInside Saigon Sandwich, there are a variety of sweets and packaged foods for your enjoyment, but I was all about the tofu b\u00e1nh m\u00ec, so that's what I ordered. And a soda out of the cooler. But, sadly, there appeared to be a booger (ew?!?) on the first one I grabbed, so I had to get another. That's worth only giving 4 stars for, I think. \n\nOnce we got our cheap and delicious-smelling sandwiches, Robert and I walked down towards City Hall to enjoy our food in the wind, and boy, did we ever. The tofu's marinade was sweet and salty and delicious, and the carrots, peppers and cilantro, the latter usually not my friend, were perfect in the mix. It was delicious and filling and left me wanting more.\n\nHowever, the sandwich, perhaps in a moment of clairvoyance, vomited all over the front of my shirt, so I walked around the rest of the day with a big Saigon Sandwich grease stain on my chest. Because I'm classy like that. B\u00e1nh m\u00ec vomit, aside, this cheap, convenient and TASSSTY place is definitely on my list of places in the city for a quick, yummy bite that won't break the bank. I should probably go back.

We liked the roast pork meatball more because it was more flavorful and it was nice getting chunks of marinated meat rather than slices of meat (roast pork).

The shredded carrots, the bright cilantro. I wanted the chewy bread. I wanted a sandwich so good that I would easily pay ten times their $3.50 asking price. A sandwich so epic I salivate writing about it. As a stroke of almost dumb luck, I clicked on a yelp entry and saw a picture of the green menu board with tacked in white letters and I knew it was my place. Siagon Sandwich is very much a to go place not far from the UN/Civic center station. The orders are simple and straight forward , not too many options on the menu so ordering is easy. I got my two sandwiches, one pork and one roast chicken. One sandwich is more than enough to be fulfilling if I was of average everyday hunger.

Luckily the line was very short (about 2 people ahead of us). The place here is tiny--it's like a hole in the wall shop with two ladies behind the counter making sandwiches and ringing people up. You can't go wrong with these sandwiches because 1.) the mayo and pate are both like crack. The pate is soft and fresh (unlike other sandwich shops that use pate that is obviously old--if you don't know what I'm talking about, you will after you try these sandwiches) 2.) The bread they use is a smaller baguette but toasted, so it's nice and crispy. 3.) The sandwiches are stuffed with tons of shredded carrots and sliced onions. 4.) If this doesn't seem good to you then you need to go for an eye exam.\n\nAnother cool thing about this place is that they carry a lot of different flavored Hi-Chew candies, and some of them are quite unusual.

I guess after that New York Times article about it being the best Bahn Mi in America it picked up a bit.  I'll say!\n\nIn 2008, they were very hole-in-the-wall; run down looking, but I mean, if it's a good sandwich, I don't really care.  But, I'm not surprised they got shut down for a while.  They look 1 MILLION times better now and more clean.  I actually trust the cleanliness now, which is good (for others more than me).  \n\nAs far as the food:  Delicious!!  Oh man, best Bahn Mi I've ever had.  Much better than Lee's across the street, and well worth the wait.  Though, if I didn't live in the neighborhood, It'd be kind of annoying that I could (realistically) eat there.  There's only \"4\" seats, all crowded, where people stand to wait.\n\nThe Bad:  The good far outweighs the bad.  Mainly, since there're only limited choices, and a lot of people order the same thing, as I waited, it felt like people passed by me and got my order.  By the time I was done, it was a completely different crowd than when I started, and I'm pretty sure people who got there after me got my same order before I did.  This wouldn't be as bad, if it didn't seem that they would really care.  The lady ordering was so busy that it was almost strangely pretentious service.  With all the dough they have to make all day with a constant line, you'd think they'd think of opening a bigger location soon?  (Please?  Or more locations?)  \n\n\nAll in all, the minor annoyances of crowdedness, weird service, and location, this place still gets 4 stars, because it's just that good.  \n\nI really wish they'd open more locations though, for their sake!

I've thought about buying an extra Banh Mi from Saigon Sandwich just to bring to the other place and saying \"This is how it's supposed to be!

Locals order in groups of 5 or so as 2 women slap the sammies together at lightning speed. 6 or 7 options plus a few of those cold glutinous rice in leaf deals are on offer as well as the strange Vietnamese desserts that I always avoid. Simple choice, I ask a local which is best. Chicken|? OK. I usually go with pate and cold cuts but I trust her and grab a chicken. With a tall cold can of coconut water my wallet is only $5 lighter.\n\nNo seating in-house I head down the street to a nice little square outside a large bank looking building and dig in. Astounding. As good as the best in Vancouver. Perfect crusty flaky outside bun with a chewy inside holding generous portions of meat and wonderfully crisp pickled carrot jalapeno and cilantro... Aand the sauce. Wow, the sauce. It drips on my jeans and I curse at the waste. I care not for stains at this point I just want every ounce of this sweet sweet food inside of me. I chase each delicious bite with the coconut water with chunks of coconut meat in it. As quick as I started and I was done. Satiated and a bit remorseful I sit for a minute in the sun, contemplating my next move. I know I want tacos but I won't be hungry for a few hours. I need to find something to do. \n\nLooking up I see a beautiful Beaux Art building. It's the Asian Art Museum and there is a current exhibition called Phantoms of Asia. Contemporary Asian artists examining spirituality within their culture. Cool. I think I found a way to kill a few hours after that amazing start to the day", "author": "Christopher N. W."}

It hurt my mouth to eat it. When it hurts to eat, it's hard to enjoy the food. The pork/meat mix and spread along with the cilantro and shredded carrots in the middle were fairly standard to what I've eaten.\n\nA good-great banh mi would at the least consist of bread that crackles and flakes a little when pressure is applied to get the size small enough to fit into my mouth. The the shell (corners/edges, and rounded areas) of the bread should crackle as easily and consistently as the main body of the bread ... which means the inner part of the bread should have a nice warm fluff. Most importantly, the temperature of the bread should be warm to my taste, with the meat slightly warmer than all else. If the meat is hot, then the carrots should be at a cold and slightly moist setting to help alleviate the temperature imbalance. When I bite into the banh mi, the texture of the bread should allow me to capture all components equally. \n\nI can fathom and have eaten much better Vietnamese sandwiches than what's available here @ Saigon Sandwich. As for the eating area? It's almost non-existent. \n\nThere are only 3 chairs here, and there could be more real estate to eat on the dashboard of my Honda Civic, than on the shelves available here. Yes, shelves, not tables... Also, 3 chairs doesn't mean the place will seat 3 comfortably. It's more like 2 comfortably because of the L-shaped design of the counter/shelves and it's respective positioning. Btw, I ate standing up because there was no way I could sit on the 3rd chair that was on the corner and pinned between my gf and another customer. \n\nThe seating is something I can overlook because as a kid, eating while standing was for rookies ...

We saved some for the morning after a long night of drinking....and wow!  Keep it cold, and it will be the most refreshing thing in the world when you're *nutrient deprived*.", "author": "Thu N."}

Just down the street from the Asian Art Museum, stopped in for a bite. It's a bit chaotic, so its helps to know the system. The menu's on the wall, make some decisions by the time you need to order (not always possible when it gets super crowded.) They take orders in small groups (5-10 small orders at a time), the rest- wait in line. Know your order (and possibly the person who was in front of you) they shout out the order when done- which can be several bbq pork sandwiches, was it yours? Grab your bevvie of choice when you get rung up, so its calculated in total. Lastly, get out of there- everything's to go my friend, it's a sandwich shop not a cafe. You want some where to sit, there's some nice grass in front of city hall. Or if you prefer not to wait, you can go to the commercialized chain Lee's and get a sandwich there for the same price ($3.50), a slightly longer bun, but slightly less tasty, with less meat and veggies, but with a table and other dessert selections.", "author": "Naomi K."}

My husband got the pork while I got the chicken, both without cilantro and extra carrots. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have cucumbers as I LOVE cucumbers on my sandwiches. We did wait a little while but when we finally got our orders they were nice and toasted and this place definitely does not skimp out on the meat. Although I didn't really enjoy my chicken one, the hubby's pork was very flavorful and the sizes were pretty big. \n\nUnfortunately, Saigon gets marked down a star for not putting cucumbers in their sandwich and for not have the BBQ Chasu pork.

They're fast and efficient, taking 10 orders at a time and turning out the sandwiches in 2-3 minutes. The ladies are nice and speak to me in vietnamese. Not bad for SF.\n\nOnto the food:\nI grew up in San Jose, the land of amazing Vietnamese food (also the land of MOM!), so this sandwich did not strike me as amazing. I was kind of disappointed by their chicken sandwich as i've had way better. Their meat is typically flavored, probably with salt, pepper, garlic powder, soy sauce and oyster sauce, (most likely MSG), and it was big and more chewy than it should be. I'm more used to shredded chicken, soft, tender, flavorful and then doused with pate. This place is decent for the location, the population it serves, and the price ($3.25-3.75/each sandwich), but it's definitely not my favorite.\n\nI am also incredibly bias when it comes to Vietnamese food, as all people due to home cooked meals and hometown eats.", "author": "Camille T."}

Do you know how dirty money is?\"\nThe other lady that worked there butted in and said, \"She did wash her hands. You just didn't see it.\"\n\nOH HELL NO.\n\nDon't lie to me when I saw the WHOLE thing. I would've been happier if they just said, \"Sorry,\" washed their hands and give me new bread. But NO. My mom didn't want to start \"trouble\" (typical Asian mentality) said just to let it go. They did give me new bread and I bought the sandwiches but I really wish that I stormed out. \n\nThey should be thankful that I didn't tell all the white people in the line behind me what happened.

Damn, on my way there I was thinking the whole time it better be worth it because I had to go through the Tenderlion... rough neighborhood O.o When I made it there I had high expectations so I orderd 2 combo's (both for myself), I got home... scarffed one down. A couple of hours later at work I felt sick to my stomach, and waalahh THREW UP. Apparently I must have the worst luck, because this probably is the only bad review you'll see about this place.

It is hands-down my favorite place to get cheap lunch in the Tenderloin (even if they did just raise the prices on me * sob*).  These sandwiches may seem small at first glance, but they are stuffed with so much awesome goodness that they fill you up pretty well.  I love love love love the roasted pork ($3.25).  It's so good. \n\nSaigon Sandwich is tiny.  And it's a tiny store in the Tenderloin, which generally isn't the area you twirl your fingers and stroll around (it's not that bad, but you know what I mean if you've ever been there).  I didn't realize where it was until a friend of mine actually had to point it out.  It's small and it's not the most spacious place on the inside either.  Whatever, though.  It's not a place to sit in and eat.  I've taken my sandwich down and eaten in front of City Hall and the Asian Art Museum before.  Both are interesting places to people watch. \n\nThere's usually a line.  I stopped by around 11:30 to grab a sandwich and that was the first time I've been there without having to wait in a long line.  It was a good change of pace.  But if you insist on coming during the lunch rush, know there is going to be a line.\n\nOh and it's cash only.", "author": "Alea G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-01", "description": "3.5 stars rounded up.\n\nA while back (over 1.5 years ago) someone had told me of  Saigon Sandwich  saying that they had \"bomb ass\" Vietnamese sandwiches hat were better than Lee's Sandwiches down the street. I checked them out on Yelp and they had a surprising number of high ratings, so I was even more curious to check them out. Unfortunately, Lee's is first when coming from my apartment so I would always wind up there instead. Yesterday, however, I was walking back to my apartment from UN Plaza, so this time Saigon Sanwich would be first. I was in the mood for a Viet sandwich, so I decided this was the time to finally check them out.\n\nLike other people have mentioned, there was a line out the door. But then again, the customer area in the store is tiny. About 5 people can fit inside at standing room.\n\nThere were 6 or 7 other people ahead of people; all but 2 had already ordered and were just waiting for their food. I ordered the Banh Mi Xiu Mai (meat ball sandwich), waited less than 10 min, and paid $3.25. I was going to also get a Viet ice coffee, but didn't see it on their limited menu which consisted of about 10 sandwiches and thats it. I never knew a Viet sandwich shop to not have Viet coffee, but everyone else was ordering only sandwiches, and Lee's is right down the street.\n\nThe Sandwich\nThe bread started off great. Thin, crispy crust and soft inside. But after a few chews, the bread was a bit too chewy and tough. Disappointing since it was almost perfect. It's not that bad though, it is certainly better than a lot of other places.\n\nThe meat was really good. Seasoned well, with a little kick. I wouldn't  say it's hot since I can eat pretty spicy foods, but you can definitely tell after a few bites that they have spices in there to add a little heat. And no, it wasn't from the jalapenos, because, come to think of it, I don't think my sandwich had jalapenos :(\n\nThe sandwich could have also had more  Chua (pickled carrot and daikon). Mine hardly had any and a Viet sandwich just isn't a Viet sandwich without  Chua. Anyone who thinks otherwise should probably just stick to Subway.\n\nConclusion\nSaigon Sandwich does make a tasty sandwich despite those minor details I mentioned (I wouldn't have rounded up otherwise).\n\nWould I go back? Maybe.\n\nTo me, their sandwiches aren't that much better than Lee's who are right down the street. They don't appear to have Viet coffee (though I could be wrong), but I've got to have a Viet iced coffee with my Viet sandwich. Plus Lee's has a lot of other goodies that I like. I know, it sounds like I'm advertising for Lee's, but really I'm just stating how they fit my needs a little better.\n\nTo whom would I recommend Saigon Sandwich?\nIf all you're loking to get is a sandwich or you don't mind making another trip to get more than a sandwich than by all means come to Saigon Sandwich.\n\nNote: They do have various canned/bottled drinks and a few \"homemade\" Viet desserts. I don't know if they make the desserts or they get them from elsewhere.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

Saigon Sandwich sounded like a perfect place, I hit it a little after the lunch hour (~2pm on a Saturday) and my sandwich came out really quickly. I went with the tofu banh mi. First off, the price was fantastic, $3.25 for a tofu banh mi. The sandwich was pretty good, it tasty fresh with generous portions of tofu. The mayo was a bit overpowering and I would've preferred the tofu to pack a little more of a punch. The veggies all tasted very fresh giving the banh mi a nice kick.

Typically I find the grilled chicken sandwich pretty consistent the few places I go to buy from. The main difference being the texture of the bread. Personally I like it a little warm and very lightly crusted so I don't bruise my mouth when I eat it.  Some places, like Lee's, use a very crusty bread which I don't like.  Saigon's chicken banh mi was similar to other places I've tried but I like the softer texture of their bread.  The roasted pork was amazing though.  The pork was the best I've tasted in a sandwich anywhere including San Jose, where I consider the capital of vietnamese cuisine.  \n\nDue to the always long line and  the fact that only the pork sandwich stood out I can only give this place a 4 star.", "author": "Kenbie L."}

Here's my summary eval:  The sandwiches are heavy versions of the ones you find in vietnam.  If you like the heartier gritty portions then you'll like this place and its prices.  If you are used to ones more like the ones in vietnam, then you will probably be expecting fresher ingredients and lighter use of mayo, pate, and the meats. \n\nI personally prefer this place's version because I am more of a carnivore, but definitely enjoyed the real thing when I was in Vietnam.  As others mention this is pretty much a small deli with other pre-made items (light cold noodle dishes, pork buns, etc).

Sometimes, when bread has been sitting, it becomes stale, tough to chew, and rough on the roof of your mouth. This is not the case for SS, however, as their bread is perfectly toasted, flaky on the outside, and soft on the inside. \n\nMy only gripe with SS, and the reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars, is that they are sometimes stingy with their meat and fill the sandwich with more of their pickled veggies, instead.

It's a great little hole-in-the-wall joint that I'm glad I finally checked out for myself. I work in the area, and I've heard countless times from my co-workers that this place had some good, cheap food. Guess I know now to trust them a little more.\n\nWhen I first came here I thought it was odd that the place was so tiny. It's about the size of my living room, with the majority of the floorspace taken up by shelves containing stacks of assorted Asian snacks, cans of soda and energy drinks, and so on. There's barely enough standing room for ten people, let alone seating room for ... well, for ANYONE. Given that it's been pretty cold and rainy in the City lately, it was a bit of a hassle to have to get everything to go, but no big deal.\n\nThe ladies behind the counter aren't there to chit-chat. They ask what you want, make it, take your money, and that's all. In a way it's kind of nice; they're incredibly efficient at what they do, taking a group of orders at one time and churning out just as many sandwiches in a few minutes. Talk about fast service!\n\nPrice-wise, you can't complain. A single sandwich is no more than $3.50, and even though there aren't too many options, they're incredibly good, and make a good-sized meal with a small bag of chips and a drink. Personally I found the roast chicken to be quite tasty, but my friends have said good things about the pork varieties. Not sure about the tofu sandwich though. Considering you can't even get as good a meal at McDonalds without paying more, I'd say Saigon Sandwich is a bargain.\n\nIf you live or work in the area Saigon is definitely a great place to stop by on a somewhat daily basis. I hear it gets crowded during lunchtime (I've only been by around 2-3PM on weekdays), but with the speed of service it probably won't take very long to get your order.

It was around 10:30ish, and I didn't know I was so lucky until I left the place. It was pretty empty when I got in; the ladies were busy making sandwiches and I ordered. It took them a bit to get my sandwiches (Roast Chicken, Roast Pork and Fanci Pork) done, but they looked like they were prepping for the rush hour later on. When I left the place, the line of people extended all the way past the door. \n\nEach sandwich was $3.00 each, and the total bill with tax was $9.50. The sandwich itself is smaller than the ones I am used to eating, but nevertheless it was packed with hearty meats and fresh and radiantly-colored veggies. They don't skimp on the ingredients. The actual sandwiches that I tried ( R.Pork and F. Pork) were a good balance; the R Pork was flavorful, and the F. Pork was subtle and fresh. \n\nThis isn't a place for you to sit and eat; it's really a grab-and-go. The little space is crammed with other products, like a sandwich place embedded in a Vietnamese grocery shop. Cute place really. \n\nThe only thing is that I asked for the Pork sandwiches to be free of jalapenos (if you can't take spices, I suggest you ask them to leave it out when they make it), but my R Pork had a bit of jalapenos smushed inside. When I first took a bite, and I felt the spices running up my tongue, but since I didn't see the jalapenos, I thought it was the sauce! My BF said they probably put some in, forgot, and took them out, leaving some seeds there for the spicy taste. Most of the sandwich was good after that, until I go to the end and my mouth was on fire and I was tearing like a baby. I looked into the sandwich and saw a little piece of jalapeno, disguised as cilantro, sticking out of my sandwich! :(  It was so spicy I had to stop eating the sandwich and down a bottle of water. I really can't take some types of spicy foods. \n\nThis place is worth a try though. Jam-Packed Ingredients onto a mini sandwich. Yum. \n\nOh! This was my fault, but when I was looking up at the menu (it looked like they only had 6 things), I thought the menu was separated by sandwiches and entrees (it had this misleading block thing). Turns out the 2nd part of the menu were sandwiches too (special combo, etc). Don't make the same mistake I did!\n\nOh, oh! When one of the ladies were taking the rest of the orders, customers were making requests like \"more sauce, more veggies, more meat,\" (all from one person, actually) etc, so I'm guessing you can sorta tailor your sandwich!

After all these years, this is still THE vietnamese sandwich shop to go to.  Before we go on long road trips, we come here and pack up bags and bags of sandwiches.  After, shopping in downtown or Chinatown, we stop by and load up on sandwiches on the way home.  On random days when I'm in a slump, I get a sandwich for lunch and I feel that much better.  It's a definitely a comfort food for me.\n\nMy favorite is the pork sandwich.  The sauce and the mayo combo is delicious.  The baguettes are always fresh.  The pickled carrots and cillantro are a must even though I'm not a fan of pickles.  And the whole thing is just 3 bucks!  I've also tried their meatball and chicken and combo and they're all also delicious but my fave will still always be pork.  Also, they sell a lot of Asian snacks and goodies along the counters.  That always gets to me when I smell fresh baked rice cake desserts.  I always have to buy something extra along with my sandwich!\n\nIt's definitely a hole in the wall type of establishment but the quality of the food is nothing of the sort.  The lines get RIDICULOUSLY long so if you're trying to get a sandwich for lunch, be ready to wait 20+ minutes.  It's true, there are only 2 ladies working their magic behind that tiny counter.  It's also best if you call in about half an hour to 45 minutes earlier than when you're expecting to pick up your order.  They're really just that busy because they're just that good!

While I loved the flavor of the pate, carrots, and spread, I was a little disappointed in the lack of flavor in the pork, the few sprigs of cilantro (which could have been chopped smaller for easier consumption), and the insanely rock-hard bread. The bread made the sandwich close to impossible for a small-mouthed person like me to eat! I couldn't even tell you how many little nibbles I had to hack away at that sandwich and how tired my jaw was at the end. And unlike Connie C., I did get plenty of battle scars in my mouth. \n\nThe flavor was good, so I was still more satisfied than not, but the sandwich coupled with the weird customer service warranted Saigon Sandwich just 3 stars in my book. Maybe if I was a regular, I wouldn't mind their weird way of doing business, but for a first timer, I felt as lost and overwhelmed as I normally do in a WalMart. You go in (if there's room for you), and you just stand there until they look at you. Now, I understand they're busy fulfilling orders, but maybe a little instruction should be nice. For the first five minutes that I was ignored, I wasn't sure what to do. Finally, the cashier announced, \"Next?\" and I finally figured it out after watching the other customers shout out their orders. You give your order, she scribbles it down lightning-fast, calls for the next order, and fills up about 10 orders before giving it to the sandwich makers. I'm sure the sandwich makers heard the orders anyway, and with only about 6 things on their menu, it wasn't difficult for them to keep up. (Out of the 20 orders I witnessed, it didn't look like they messed any of them up. That was pretty impressive for having taken more than one order per minute.) Then the cashier starts bagging up the orders as they're made, announces the order, and you go get it and pay her. Cash only, and I have to say, at least they don't have the same person handling the food and the money (unlike other places, yeesh!).

I have loved the place for over a decade, constantly rave about it to all my friends, once brought over 100 sandwiches for a party, have spent thousands of dollars there (that is a lot of sandwichs at $3 a piece, and $2 in past years), and known and liked the ladies who work there/ own the place. \n\nThat is why I am so sad that I just had a very bad experience there and will never go back.  I purchased 2 sandwiches and a drink which totaled $8.25 and I got $1.75 back for my ten bill.  Then as I waited for my final sandwich, I decided to grab that last pork bun and gave the woman my other ten bill; whereupon she gave me back $1.25.  I politely told her I think you are confused because I already paid for my sandwich with my other ten bill.  She said no.  I said \"Why would I then have exactly $1.75 in my pocket?\" (which had nothing else but my cell phone in it).  She said no.  I said \"Think about it.  What I have in my purse equals $8.25 and I have $1.75 in my pocket.\"  She said no. \n\nIt went on like this for a few more minutes.  I genuinely believe she believed she was right and was confused because it is a very busy store, all cash, no receipts ever given, and I had 2 ten bills.

The flavors of everything inside the sandwich are really excellent, but the bread was really hard. Not quite stale, but I really had to rip it apart with my teeth.\n\nAdditionally, this wouldn't be a place you would eat at, rather a place you would pick your food up at and then eat at a second location. There is one table, and the rest of the space is taken up by people waiting in (the sometimes extremely long) line. The atmosphere is impersonal and fast paced. Which I think is absolutely fine, especially in the city. But anyone who doesn't know what Bahn Mi is or wants to try it for the first time shouldn't come here.\n\nThe vegetable fillings are already put together in one container, so you probably couldn't ask for them to hold anything. Also, I saw some flies buzzing around the veggies when one of the workers wasn't looking. I know that they don't have the time to cover up the food because one customer comes in right after another, but this was slightly disconcerting to me.\n\nThe food here is very cheap, but you can find a cheap Vietnamese sandwich ANYWHERE. Especially in the neighborhood Saigon Sandwich is located.\n\nIn short, I really do like this place, and think they do a fine job. They cater to people who know exactly what they want, and have other places to go to eat it. But I'm really surprised at the popularity of this place.

The sandwiches are f***ing great.\n\nBanh mi, Vietnamese for sandwich, has been one of my diet staples since I was a kid. In San Francisco, there is really only one neighborhood where you can procure these delectable snacks: the Tenderloin, otherwise known as Little Saigon. According to a friend of mine, Saigon Sandwiches is known to be the best Vietnamese deli in the Tenderloin. The line out the door was my first indication that this might truly be the case.\n\nVietnamese sandwiches are the product of French imperialism and so it's no surprise that they're always on a baguette. The most traditional banh mi is the dac biet, or special, sandwich. Dac biet sandwiches are typically lined with mayonnaise and pate, and then stuffed with combination cold cuts (think Italian but add a Vietnamese flavor), julienned carrots, cucumber, pickled daikon, cilantro, and green chili peppers. A little soy sauce is sprinkled on top and voila! You have a pretty filling sandwich that will cost you around two bucks. Yes, you heard me right: two bucks. \n\nThe dac biet sandwich at Saigon is my favorite. There's a generous dollop of pate (which I love), the bread is obviously fresh, and the toppings all bring me home to the combination of flavors I love so much. The chilies are a must, but be sure to instruct the sandwich maker to omit them if you are a wimp. \n\nI also had the barbequed pork sandwich which is also out of this world. The meat is marinated quite wonderfully. Other banh mi options include chicken, tofu (I've never in my life tried this version), and meatball pork. Are the sandwiches totally, totally authentic? Well, maybe the bread is a little plumper than those available in Vietnam but other than that, these sandwiches kick ass according to this Saigon-born chick.\n\nIt'll be hard, but branch out and try other goodies wrapped fresh daily on the cramped counter.", "author": "Baochi N."}

I'm one of them. Alongside that, as an actual Asian, there's that hidden snobbery that lurks beneath (or shows itself very obviously, whatever) when I talk to a non Asian who recommends a great dim sum place or a bakery with the best pork buns. I find that usually, upon checking out the aforementioned recommendation, my usual place is still better. Go me. Cue more foodie-ego inflation and smug city girl attitude.\n\nSo that's how I walked into my de-virginizing Saigon Sandwich experience. A little wary, more than a little arrogant, and definitely convinced that I smelled overrated all over the place (alongside the urine soaked streets outside). I've had my fair share of delicious banh mis - convinced that Irving Cafe & Deli was the best and that even if it wasn't, that SS wouldn't be *that* good. So there's always a line out the door - even on any obscure non-meal hour on a weekday. So it's been on some of the country's \"best sandwiches\" list and has almost 600 reviews on Yelp to date with an average of almost a full five stars. So freaking what! I'm Asian, man.\n\nBut then, I tried it . . . and now, disgruntled but without a doubt ready, I gotta say it: it's not overrated. At ALL. The bread is especially notable - deliciously solid and crunchy on the outside, fresh, chewy and heartily soft on the inside. Meats are marinated and flavorful as are the veggies. Pate is generous and freaking delicious. The two ladies behind the counter are impressive in memorizing orders and cranking out the rolled up bread-y, meat-y, tasty rolls of deliciousness (yes, I am very accurate AND descriptive).\n\nSo basically, everyone else was right.\n\nDamn it. This kills my elitist facade.\n\nIt's okay, though. Totally, totally worth it.", "author": "Betty W."}

After the transactions are completed, they jot down the next five (give or take) customers' orders and it continues.  I got the combo banh mi and it was good, but not mind blowing.

I think the ratings are so high because (1) choices are limited when it comes to Vietnamese sandwiches in this area, so beggars can't be choosers, and (2) people love hole-in-the-wall type joints that give them good value, which this place does because yes, the sandwich is very meaty and filling.\n\nThat being said, I think this place is good if you're looking for a filling, non-traditional sandwich, but not if you're looking for an authentic Vietnamese sandwich (which is what I was expecting and why I was disappointed). They don't have head cheese, and they overload on the pate and mayo. The \"fancy pork\" is some processed pork-like product with the texture of fish cake. The roast pork does have nice flavor -- smoky and meaty.\n\nOverall, it was a heavy, somewhat bastardized version of what I'm used to in a Vietnamese sandwich that got a little icky towards the end because it was so meaty.

Why? \n\nI don't understand what the worship status is with their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich). it was very sweet (a warning to diabetics!).\n\nI grabbed one of the prepackaged little rice flour snacks off the counter and ordered a standard dac biet (special, combo) banh mi, and well, I didn't have any expectations even after the glowing reviews. better to be pleasantly surprised rather than let down, right? \n\nHere goes:\n \nThe bread was good. The inside of the sandwich however- it was missing the head cheese that I've gotten in all banh mi dac biet. No biggie, just a note. it appeared to be replaced with some fatty grilled pork. I'm not against fatty foods (I like my share of Southern and fried fare) but I don't like chunks of artery stoppers. The liver pate they used was very good though, it had a very fresh flavour. it also contained the standard pale pork meatloaf-type thing (I liken it to German leberkase).\n\nWhere oh where did my shredded daikon go? I neglected to look over the counter to see if they actually had any, but I was pretty confident they would have it- seems like a staple. I like pickled daikon. I felt a little gypped!\n\nI asked for no cilantro. NO CILANTRO! Luckily I checked before taking my first bite or it would have ruined the entire sandwich for me- I removed two big sprigs of said offensive herb of evil (those wiley banh mi makers, I tell ya). I was standing there and the banh mi order taker told the maker three times, and she even nodded in acknowledgement! What the heck? \n\nthe one thing that put me off was the sweetness of the entire sandwich. After about four bites I couldn't handle it anymore, and I set some soy sauce on it to try and bring it back to the savory side of things. it didn't seem to help and I didn't want my sandwich tasting of soy sauce, so I only managed about 3/4 of the way through before I just couldn't have any more of my sweet sandwich. What the heck was all the sugar about? \n\nThe prepackaged thingy is called banh beo- little rice flour disks that are steamed until tender, topped with a cooked mung bean paste, ground dried shrimp and chopped green onions. This version also had some chopped bits of grilled pork and what I deciphered after some chewing was shredded pork skin. it was alright, but their fish sauce seemed a little sweet to me too. Am I becoming diabetic? \n\nOverall it was passable, but no matter how bad my banh mi craving is while in SF, I'm saving it for my two spots in Oakland where I get consistent savory goodness.\n\n**2/12/07 update**\nJR and I had the chicken banh mi the other day. He concurred that it had a sweet sauce on it (ok, so my taste buds are NOT going haywire!) and that he preferred the ones I get at the 'other' place. Not only that but the chicken here isn't grilled- it's just 'cooked' or even cut up! I had large sections of chicken that fell out of my sammich that were too big. The 'other' place actually grills their chicken.\n\nI also picked up some banh cuon (rice rolls with ground pork & julienned wood ear fungus) and some banh beo. The banh cuon was very salty in comparison to the rest of their food- the most savory thing dare I say. The rice wrapping containing the filling was the wrong consistency and texture-it was more like a steamed Chinese rice roll you would get at a dim sum house- thick and opaque, not delicate and translucent. \n\nThe Banh beo was a gloopy, greasy mess. Where did the grease come from? WTF. I have had many but never were there little pools of oil on the bottom of the container! And they were steamed, not fried so the grease really is a mystery. I understand a little is used to keep them from sticking together, but come on. They were so soggy they fell apart. \n\nI'm still staying away from this place so you guys can have my place in line.

In fact, I was looking for one of the famouse food trucks that was supposed to be in the vicinity... then I came across this dinky little place.  I wouldn't have known that this was even a food joint, had it not been for a long line of people out the door!  It is my motto, never pass up a food joint with a long line of people.  So I got in line, without knowing what kind of food or 'stuff' they were selling.  This was the BEST decision I made in SF!  So the place turns out to be a dinky little Bhan Mi shop.  Again, without the long line of people out the door, I wouldn't have known that this was even a restaurant!  I was a bit confused on how to order or pay or get my food, so my place in line was sniped by a couple of sneaky old ladies, but a nice dude behind me told me what to do - I yelled out my order and stepped to the side and waited for my bahn mi to be assembled.  The place doesn't have a decent place to sit and eat... unless you want to be trempled by people waiting for their order.  So I took my sandwhich and headed out to a nearby park - ironically, they were having off-the-grid food truck gathering with the exact food truck I was looking for... go figure.  \nAnyway, I dug into my grilled pork bhan mi... THE BEST EVERRRRR!!!!  Oh my goodness, they have perfected the french baguette!  Perfectly golden, crunch outside and airy, chewy and flavorful inside.  Pickeled veggeis, a bit of sriracha and grilled pork were absolutely perfect combination!  Literally, orgy of flavor and texture in my mouth!!!  All for less than four bucks, are you freakin' kidding me!!!???  A MUST!!!!", "author": "MJ L."}

Although there are two seats in the store front, this place is really only for take-out.  Their roasted pork sandwich is one of the best sandwiches, of any type, that I have ever had.  Don't be put off by the interior and you won't regret stopping in to this shop in little Saigon.\n\nOverall, best sandwich in the city.  Just get a sandwich and tell me I'm wrong (they're only $3.25).", "author": "Thomas J."}

(Side note: if you are a woman, do not go here alone unless it is between 12-1 so there are sure to be enough other suits around on lunch to keep the crackheads from seriously harassing you).\n\nSo, after having my \"hot ass\" only briefly acknowledged by crackheads, I head inside this place and tell the woman I would like the chicken sandwich.  My friend ordered the fancy pork and stressed NO CILANTRO (she hates the stuff).  \n\nWell, after quickly dodging crackheads on our way back to a nice area to sit and eat, we unwrap our sandwiches and find, lo and behold, there is a fancy pork sandwich WITH cilantro and a TOFU sandwich without cilantro.  Wtf???? I mean, does \"chicken\" sound like \"tofu\"? I think not.  I ate the tofu sandwich anyways but it was NOT good.  Cold, bland tofu - yuck! I voiced my disapproval to my friend who jumped to Saigon Sandwiches' defense saying that \"well, there was a decent line and she just made a mistake.\"\n\nOk, ok, I'll allow for a mistake, but....\n\nTwo weeks later, after agreeing to give the place another try, they totally f$%^ed up again!!  This time there was no one else in line and when I ordered my chicken and she ordered her fancy pork sans cilantro, we annoyingly pestered them to make sure she had the right thing.  I said \"that's chicken, right?\" like 4 times.  My friend said it maybe twice and thought my 4 times was a bit unnecessary until...\n\nThey gave my friend the TOFU instead of the Fancy pork this time WITH cilantro!  And for good measure, they even wrote \"fancy pork\" on the outside of the paper wrap!! \n\nI swear, they just want to get rid of that nasty tofu and bank on you not checking your sandwich until you are too far away from the place to want to make the trek again thru the crackheads to exchange!! \n\nAnd although I got my chicken this time, I was decidedly disappointed and actually fairly disgusted -- the chicken quality was nonexistant; cartilege-y, fatty, and generally gross.  \n\nTwo stars for the yummy bread though and if you are so lucky as to actually get the fancy pork, it is actually quite tasty.

A mere $2.50 for a sandwich, with all the ingredients tasting perfectly fresh - most likely made that morning - the ingredients I mean, the sandwich is made before your eyes.  I like to get the roast chicken or roast pork (or both!) with extra greens, meaning more cilantro and jalapen~os.  The carrot salad that accompanies the sandwich is top notch, and the slathering of mayo-like sauce mingles so nicely with the bbq juices of the meats.  Damn they're so good.\n\nThey also offer several other Vietnamese street food style dishes, all wrapped up to go - fresh veggie rolls, pork/shrimp rolls, etc.  All good.  Tons of sweets as well.  Crazy shit really - you feel like you're in a little store in Vietnam.  It's fun to eat your grub at the window seats and watch/listen to all the folks strolling in from all walks of life.  A true melting pot of a store.  Killer food, the great equalizer.\n\nThe set up is essentially take-out - there are 3 or 4 seats in the window, but they're usually blocked by the line that forms out the door.

The place hasn't changed, it still serves one of the best tasting Vietnamese sandwiches in the city for a messily $3 bucks!\n\nThe shop uses thick French loaves which are split, toasted, and then stuff with your choice of roast pork, tofu , meatball, chicken, jambon, or pate and also an assortment of pickled carrots, cilantro, jalapenos and some white vegetable that I don't know the name of (it doesn't matter because it doesn't deter from the flavour). \n\nI've had the roast pork, the chicken and the tofu, all of which were delicious, and, though, I absolutely loved the roast pork, I found a new favourite which is their tofu sandwich. The tofu is marinated and slightly crispy, but not watery! \n\nI also suggest you try the other items offered at the shop such as the Vietnamese peanuts, the pork buns, and the mini meals wrapped up in cellophane. The peanuts are coated in coconut and are addicting. The pork buns are not what you might expect. Instead of finding a red sweet sauce with BBQ pork inside, the Vietnamese bun has marinated pork with mushrooms, rice vermicelli, and half a hard boiled egg. The cellophane wrapped meals are just darn good. Be careful and try not to spill the fish sauce (provided in each wrapped meal) on you.

The bread was just the right temperature, the pork was cooked just right, and the toppings were fresh.  The second time I went was around 5pm and I ordered the \"fanci pork.\"  I would advise against this \"fanci pork\" which was neither fanci nor pork.  As I tried to force feed this sandwich down my throat, I got the distinct impression that the sandwich has laid fallow for several hours prepped with mayo and other sauces that turn bad quickly.  This place has quick turnaround during lunch but seems pretty slow the rest of the day.  \n\nI also tried one of the white round buns stuffed with rice noodles and meat.  It was average.  \n\nIn short, if you go, go during the lunch hour and get the roast pork.", "author": "David L."}

The price is right--$3. You get plenty for your money, and you won't want a second--that would ruin the singularity of the sandwich.\n\nSo, close your laptop, hop on the bus (#31 or #19 are near, but it's close to downtown anyway) and go.

The food is delicious and very inexpensive.  The limiting reagent in many Vietnamese sandwiches has been, in my opinion, the quality of the bread.  This is not the case with this place - the bread here is fresh and crisp.  As a vegetarian, I only ever order the tofu but have heard fantastic things about the other sandwiches from my friends and colleagues.  The wait can be a little long (they tend to take a bunch of orders at a time and assemble all of those before they take another batch) but well worth it - just keep it in mind when you go for lunch on a weekday.  They also have a wide selection of southeast Asian desserts.  This place is a great way to buy food for a lot of people inexpensively (my husband has bought food for meetings with ~20 people) - just call ahead to place the order.\n\nAs a side-note, I once was drawn to the newer, shinier, and larger place across the street (Lee's... they have a more extensive menu as well) and found the food to be vastly inferior.

That phrase, coined by the hilarious Laura B, most definitely, completely and absolutely applies to these sandwiches. \n\nSo I had a hearing at City Hall to attend, which happen to be on the same date as the ruling determining whether gay couples could resume marriage ceremonies (yay!). So the joint was mobbed, is what I'm saying. I go to my hearing and am super hungry at like 10 a.m. when it starts. EFF. Where am I going to find something to eat? My iphone is busted so I might as well have a soup can and 2 strings. I have no pocket Yelp, is what I'm saying here. \n\nThen I remember: the sandwich shop! Oh sweet mother of god, I will go there. It will be glorious. The hearing ends, I call my husband to confirm shop location, and off I go. I pass doorway after doorway smelling like a combo of fresh and stale pee. I see a line out the shop already. Fiddlesticks! The lady takes like 12 orders at a time. I ordered the simple roast pork. I wait in line, and of course OF COURSE a toothless meth addict kneels out front of the shop and begs for food and rants about how much life sucks because no one will allow her fucking rat (her words) into places. Like church. And restaurants. I eventually put my headphones on to drown her out. I then questioned my compassion as a fellow human. But I digress. \n\nSeriously 20 minutes go by, and I'm starting to wither I'm so freaking hungry. But voila! There's 12 sandwiches lined up in a row with pork and mayo in them. The other lady puts peppers, cilantro and carrots in there, wraps them up, and rings you up. $3.25. DUDE. Although the last time I was here it was $2.50 (2006). \n\nSo I get the sandwich, and while I'm walking down Larkin, I bite into it. Friends, perhaps it's the fact I haven't had a French roll in 100 years because I've been trying to low-carbing it, but I literally thought I was going to pass out in ecstasy. It was perfectly toasted on the outside, soft on the inside. The bread alone was heaven. Then I got to the good stuff. I was literally making MM MMM MM sounds while I'm walking down Larkin Street. The pork so tender. The mayo so salty and perfectly juxtaposing the crisp cilantro. The sandwich is pretty big, and since I've recently employed the rule of eating until I'm 70-80% full, as opposed to the point of pants-splitting regret. So I put  of the sandwich away in my work bag for enjoyment later. During my BART ride back to the office, I'd periodically open my work bag, take a good whiff, and die just a little bit in pure food ecstasy. I get back to the office and tell my office mate: SMELL MY BRIEFCASE. NO, JUST DO IT. \n\nMind-blowing sandwich. Wish I lived in the city still so I could have them more often.", "author": "H H."}

I always come here to satisfy my sometimes INSANE crave and urge to eat vietnamese sandwiches. Saigon sandwich is the shining light at the end of my tunnel, rock to my scissors, wind beneath my wings; not only do I look forward to it, it is my alpha, my fulfillment of hope as a beacon to my desires. Up until now, I nearly lost all hope in finding a FOOD worthy of 5 stars. Ran by 2 vietnamese women, this hole in the wall is somewhat hard to spot.. if you don't know where to look. I always come here to get either the Fanci Pork Sandwich or the Roast Chicken Sandwich. Both are good, but I prefer the roast chicken sandwich. The meat is very succulent and tender, rips right to the bite; it is juicy, and made perfectly with love from the dainty fingers of its maker. The hot pepper, cilantro, and other mini vegetables inside the sandwiches are very fresh, springy, and crunchy. The BEST part of this sandwich that deserves to be spotligtted is the bread. The bread is crunchy, yet soft. I don't know exactly how to put it, but the bread is very well balanced. It is crunchy, but not jagged crunchy, soft, but not in a damp way, and delicious, but not overpowering to the meat. The bread is very good. \n\nWaiting in line at this popular destination, and watching the sandwich chefs create magic and delight, I can tell lots of love and pride is put into each individual sandwich.

Well, it's not my favorite Vietnamese sandwich place in the city, but I am a fan. I usually indulge in pork and pork product variations of Banh Mi.

Other than their \"pate\" sandwich, with mashed pork liver gushing out of every bite, I don't really care for the other pork items. I do appreciate the poultry and vegetarian options. I think I visit this place mostly for those options. The \"roast chicken\" is juicier than the \"roast pork,\" surprisingly. The sauce is a little sweet but still delish! The \"tofu\" is wet and sloppy. I usually walk outta there immediately munching on my order, but I can't do that with the \"tofu.\" That wet, sloppy, sticky sandwich requires a bib and a nearby sink!

I was in San Fran for the weekend, ate here Saturday for lunch got the roast pork and  some shrimp spring rolls.  So fresh, so good.  Here's what comes on your sandwich, pork, carrot, jalapeno, pickled onion, cilantro, and a lemony french mayo, all on the perfectly baked french roll.  \nI went back on Monday to get some to-go back to Denver.  Because these sammies are warm, they tend to get a little saugy, but if you pop it in a toaster oven at 325, they get nice and crispy again.   \nI brought home a roast pork, a special combination(roast pork, steamed pork, pork belly?, and pork pate)  Yeah Buddy!\nI also got 2 Bahn Gio, which are the triangular banana leaves with a pork filled rice dumpling inside.  They are really tasty, kinda weird, but there is way more dumpling than pork.  Oh and cheap, cheap cheap!  2 sandwiches and 2 Bahn Gio for $10.", "author": "Matt P."}

I wasn't going to do this, but after a few weeks of the aftershock wearing off, I feel it's my duty to at least warn you all of possible similar tragedies happening to your sandwich.\nI went to Saigon because of all of your rave reviews. I love vietnamese sandwiches, so I went and ordered two tofu, one with mayo for my roommate and mine without, and one roasted pork with pate (since everyone raved about it). Well, my roommate and I enjoyed our tofu sandwiches immensely. So much so, that later the same day I broke out the pate sandwich and took a bite. I looked at my sandwich and noticed a hair. No biggie, I mean, these sandwiches are good... I can deal with a hair. BUT, when I proceeded to pull it out, it wouldn't budge. So, naturally I opened the sandwich to remove the hair. What did I see? What was the problem. It was a whole entire hair ball the size of a quarter, bigger than the kind you get floating around your clothes in the dryer with your laundry. I was absolutely disgusted. I mean, think of how you feel when you find one hair? I really don't know how they missed it, I certainly couldn't miss it!!!! Anyway, I still gag a bit EVERY TIME I think about it. I went to Lee's and I have to say everything is much cleaner and sanitary there, and the veggie sandwich was damn good too. I forced myself to try Saigon again, even though my first experience was tragic. They were all out of sandwiches when I showed up at 5pm, but I went the following day and had a tofu. It was ok, but not as good as the first one. I don't think one will ever be as good as the first one because of the hair ball I found in my second one... it haunts me! lol\n\nSeriously, stay away from the pate... god knows what else is in there.", "author": "Lauren M."}

They are both located on Larkin near Eddy, about a block apart. Saigon Sandwich is at 560 Larkin while Baguette Express is at 668 Larkin.\n\nSo, what the hell's a banh mi? It combines a buttery French baguette with meat (usually barbecued), cilantro, pickled carrots, some spicy peppers, and sometimes mayonaisse. In other words, it combines the best of France with the SouthEast Asian melding of flavors: sweet, sour, salty, and spicy.\n\nBaguette Express is clean, tidy and they have a machine that they can run some sugarcane through to get you your fix of sugarcane juice (haven't had it? then you haven't yet backpacked around South East Asia - you get addicted to this stuff there). It's slightly bigger than Saigon Sandwich and you can even sit down at a table or two. Saigon Sandwich is a small, cluttered little shop that has a lot more Vietnamese snacks to sell than Baguette Express. Both run around $2.50 per sandwich so it's probably the best deal in the entire city.\n\nBaguette Express's bread has that difficult-to-get balance of crunchy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside, while Saigon's is not as crunchy but still soft. The choice of meats are broader at Baguette Express and that's where Saigon Sandwich to me really shines. The meats there are just better - I think because they focus on fewer than Baguette Express. I compared a barbeque pork sandwich and a barbeque chicken sandwich from both places. I also felt that Saigon's balance of the sweet/spicy barbecue sauce, sweet/sour pickled carrots, spiciness of its peppers, cilantro, and mayo really balance well, while with Baguette Express the flavors were not as powerful.", "author": "Roy J."}

I stumbled upon this little hole in the wall one day and decided to give it a try. I was not dissapointed. Their bahn mi's deliver on almost every front. The cilantro is fresh, the pickled vegetables are sweet and bright and the meat is bursting with that salty, umami flavor we all love. My only problem with this sandwich is the bread. It is super crunchy almost to the point of being hard. It's not a petite sandwich either, so you really have to tear in to this thing with some aggression. Nevertheless, I can get past the texture of the bread because of how awesome the sandwich is overall. Just beware, the roof of your mouth might be a little sore after eating one of these beasts.", "author": "Eric M."}

If you want better bread and a sandwich that doesn't drip pate out the other end as you try to take a bite go to Lee's down the street.  Lee's is also cleaner, newer and offers a better selection of Vietnamese snacks and goodies.", "author": "Amber L."}

It just occurred to me today as I was riding the shuttle through the TL that perhaps one of the little shops along Larkin might be worth checking out. A quick yelp search on my trusty blackberry suggested that Saigon Sandwich was the place to go. Around lunch time, there was a rather long line out the door of this unassuming little shop. \n\nKenny: People in San Francisco are so obsessed with food they will wait in line if the food is worth it.\nMe: Actually, they'll wait in line just because there is a line.\n\nSo, being the San Franciscans that we are, Kenny and I waited a good 15 minutes with high expectations for our potentially over hyped sandwiches. Our order was taken before we even reached the counter- Kenny going for the roast chicken and pork, while I stuck with the only vegetarian option on the menu, tofu. We waited a bit longer and finally the sandwiches were ready, and for the price ($2.75) the quantity is certainly not lacking. We sat down by the window to try our much awaited treats, while sipping on some very strange creamy-coconutty- tapioca and bean concoctions. The sandwiches were warm, the baguette slightly crispy (but not as good as at Mr. Baguette). The tofu was tasty, it is the kind of fried tofu that you find in inari sushi- fried, seasoned, and pressed into sheets. Also in the mix were an assortment of pickled vegetables- onions, carrots, and peppers. The pickles were not as sweet as at Mr Baguette, but the peppers were spicier. I tried Kenny's meat sandwiches but was not a fan. The roast chicken was mostly dark meat, and tasted too meaty for me. The pork was also a bit on the strong side. They serve the meat sandwiches with a generous dousing of gravy, which results in soggy bread if not eaten immediately. As for the drinks- the green and white coconut cream variety was not bad, tasted almost like melted ice cream with some green jelly chunks swimming about. The tapioca drink on the other hand (the one with the little balls that look like frog eggs) was definitely not my cup of tea. In summary, this is a cheap sandwich place which is definitely worth paying a visit to if you happen to be in the area and are not in a rush.

She has yet to steer me wrong with their food.  \nSo, SO cheap, and so tasty. The sandwiches here are warm, taste of fresh ingredients, and the options, while limited, offer something for everybody. I have only had the chicken and various pork offerings, but they are consistent in their tastiness. While there is almost always a wait, the two ladies take orders and fill them with an efficiency rarely seen today in the business. How she remembers who got what is absolutely beyond me. \nMy favorite moment that stems from this was when i picked up three sandwiches from here, and took them over to 1000 Van Ness to watch \"Nacho Libre\" with two of my male friends. I had two pork and one chicken one, and I swore up and down I asked for no peppers. I started in on mine, and both boys asked me for one. But two minutes after I heard the paper rustle in the unwrapping process, I thought they were going to cry from the heat. Both of them were sweating bullets from the first few bites into the sandwiches. The peppers are there, proceed with caution. \nSo the neighborhood's a little sketch, but really, you are only going to spend 15, maybe 20 minutes tops waiting around, and the \"local color\" reminds me that i DO live in a city with depth. \nIf you are feeling adventurous, try the various sweets in front of you, or the variety of drinks in the fridge. Their summer rolls are pretty good as well.", "author": "Jessica S."}

She takes 4-5 people's orders at a time so you have to wait a few minutes, but it's worth the wait! We took these to eat out in front of Union Square (I feel bad eating in front of all the homeless people waiting around in the Tenderloin)...Highly recommended place", "author": "Emiko M."}

There are all sorts of mysterious and interesting-looking foods wrapped in cellophane at the front counter, but I've never tried any of them. I'm all about the sandwiches. Pork is my favorite. Lots of hot peppers and cillantro, on these little rolls. Two is good for me, but most hungry men opt for three. Their fresh spring rolls are also nice. We usually order ahead, and then drive over -- metered parking is easy enough during the day. There's usually a line out the door, as most people don't call ahead -- and after five or ten minutes, I'm up at the counter and have my stuff, ready to jam it back to the office and share the goodies with the group. Highly recommended -- and best under-$5 lunch I can think of.", "author": "Zoe H."}

I gave it 4 stars.  Missing 1 star because the price has gone up tremendously.  My mom use to come here and purchase in bulk.  They use to have deals such as buy 2 get 1 free, but that was way back in the days.  My favorite sandwich is the xie mai, combo, and cha.  I love adding pate in it.  Taste so much better.  The line gets a bit crazy.  It goes outside the door, but the service is really fast.  The lady takes down a bunch of orders at one time.  Makes that batch and that group of people leave.  There are usually only 2 workers there because the back counter will not fit more than 5.  The space is really small.  It's impossible to walk side by side.  Definitely worth the $3.

If you happen to be on this sketchy block in the TL anytime between noon and 2pm there will be a very frightening line. All of those people making that mecca of a journey, just to shuffle in and shout their order in the tiny place with literally 2 seats,are without a doubt on to something. Aside from the fact that for $3.50 you will get a meal that will last well into dinner time, this is a culinary pearl in the rough. The vegetables are actually pickled on site. All of the proteins are slow roasted in heating bins. The gravy is not coming out of a can. This is the real thing, down to simmered juices and what I suspect is arrow root, to congeal but not diminish the integrity of the savory sauce. I will warn that if your a vegan it isn't an option. However, if you can handle a bit of chicken stock base, the Tofu sandwich is ideal.This place can get crowded,noisy,cramped,and make you yearn for an empty bus bench that doesn't smell like urine. However, once you unwrap that stiff paper package, a symphony of aroma will put you at ease. This sandwich hits every spot on a flavor palette that screams C-O-M-F-O-R-T. It's made of all those special blend of spices and ingredients that any food scientist worth his weight, will tell you set off all those happy little synapses,that just make you smile. Basically, look past the cover and just enjoy what they offer up. One damn good sandwich! In 6 years only once did I have a mediocre lunch.", "author": "Jaclyn O."}

They are a perfect option when you want to get something to eat on the cheap.  \nThe one drawback to Saigon Sandwiches can be THE LINE.  It can be a crush to get up to the counter.  Sometimes, even when the line is short, there will likely be someone in front of you who will have phoned in an order of 25 sandwiches.  \nThey recently raised prices a quarter, which may have taken them out of the running for the cheapest Bahn Mi in SF.  First, all of the meat sandwiches went up in price, while the tofu option remained at a low $2.   When I went back 2 weeks later, the tofu had kept pace with the other choices and made the jump to $2.25.  \nIf I wan't to sit at the small counter (seats 2 max), I can keep an eye out for the hated (the DPT), should one of those sneaky mother fuckers have it in mind that they want to issue me a ticket.

I think the real stars of the sandwich were the bread which was soft on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside and the spread (butter mayo) which was delicious and gave the sandwich that extra unctuous mouth feel that makes it taste and feel like a decadent delight.

Let's give Saigon Sandwiches another try.\"  I winced at the memory of how dirty it was, but that memory faded away as I approached the store front and saw that they had 3 people working the shop and they've re-organized the shop a little so it's more open in the back where they make the food.  The woman taking the order was a pleasant younger Vietnamese woman who ran a tight ship with the orders and handled all the cash.  One woman (the owner?) toasted the sandwiches, put on the mayo and the meat, and another woman was handled the veggies and wrapping.  I ordered two roast pork sandwiches and brought them home ten minutes later.  The sandwiches were even better than I remembered!  Moist and super flavorful!  I'm so glad they cleaned up the store and that I can return with a peace of mind.  I think this place will definitely be in my weekend rotation.", "author": "Trinh N."}

I got the usual roast chicken and roast pork and ventured to try the fanci pork.  I had to share them with my husband and 2 young kids, it was definitely not enough food!  I didn't eat them right away but toasted them in the toaster oven a bit to crisp the bread up again.  The chicken and roast pork were flavorfully marinated with good amount of veggie topping.  The fanci pork was a nice change, very mild but still good.  And the prices haven't changed too much over time.  Just $3 for these delicious sandwiches, totally a great deal!\n\nGo again?

I usually just go for the sandwiches and that's about it. It's a pretty decent price, around $2. The problem I find is that it is always crowded and waiting in line is a bore. The lines usually go out the door  and takes a really long time to get to the front. The shop is VERY crowded and cramped and you better make your decision fast or you're going to be hearing complaints from the people behind you.

It's not the \"fanci\" pork, but the other one. I don't exactly know what the difference is, but I think the \"fanci\" pork is the one I'm used to. The one I had was really good, nevertheless. The bread was toasted just right and they weren't stingy with the vegetables and the meat. The pate also tasted right, unlike the one near my apartment that was dry and rather tasteless.

This is another very famous hole-in-the-wall, rumored to be a favorite of THE Julia Child. On a very cold afternoon in SF, we made a quick stop for the chicken sandwich and the pork sandwich. Both were delicious...it's something about the sauce...sweet and tangy, not all mayo/buttery like Lee's. The bread was warm and crispy on the outside. The picked veges were great and the peppers were the perfect hotness- not overpowering. I did like the pork a little better than the chicken though.

The bread was unbelievable -  crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle. But what made the sandwich was the filling. Didn't matter if it's chicken, pork or pate, it's ALL good. We moved away to NY, and I couldn't quite find Vietnamese food that compared to what we used to get in the Bay Area. Fast forward three and half years later. We're out in SF for the holiday weekend. Lunchtime rolled around today and I thought, \"What I wouldn't give for one of those sandwiches.\" All this time, and nothing's changed! Their sandwiches are just as good as I remember. I ordered the pork banh mi - juicy, tender pieces of pork, thin spicy slices of jalapeno, crunchy slivers of veggies, all drizzled with a special dressing and mayo, and stuffed inside one of the best french rolls I've had. This place did not disappoint. We treated a friend to a pork and pate banh mi, and she said it blew her usual banh mi out of the water. At $3 a pop, it's more than we used to pay (we were coming here when it was $2.25), but really it's still cheaper than anything. In a word: amazing!

What could I add that has not already been said? Well I am going to break my own rule and contribute some thoughts on Saigon Sandwich.   First the positives:  Cheap, generous and very tasty.  If you are looking for a sandwich that is big, very affordable and undeniably yummy this is for you.  The location is what it is. If you are not cool with the TL don't go there. My complaint, if it is a complaint, is that I was looking for a Bahn Mi and what  Saigon Sandwich serves is not like any Bahn Mi I have ever seen. Every other Bahn Mi, from Oakland to Austin and plenty of places in between was great because of the balance between the ingredients; not too many veggies relative to the meat and certainly not too much meat relative to the veggies. Even in the heart of central Texas, during the worst drought ever, the veggies were not over powered by the meat. At Saigon Sandwich, it is all about the meat. We tried the pork meatball, on the advice of a  regular, and the pork, which was shredded, not grilled, and from the moment they were handed to me I knew this was something else. They seemed to weigh as much as a big, tin foil wrapped burrito I remember from the old days at El Faro. They were greasy, sloppy and left me not feeling ready to continue our day long stroll thru the city on a perfect Indian summer afternoon.  The Times may call this the best Banh Mi in America but you can call me a non believer.", "author": "larry B."}

I had to deduct 2 stars though. The first star was for the extremely slow service. Yes, they do make sandwiches really fast but who the hell are they for? You keep seeing them throwing them into white plastic bags but they aren't for the customers in line. I'm assuming they are orders but when you have a line of 6 people, shouldn't you be trying to make the 1-2 sandwiches most people are buying during lunch time so you can get the people in and out instead of the 25 someone is picking up later? The second star is for deliberately letting firemen, paramedics, and cops cut in line. They would take everyone's order but then make theirs first. I don't care who you are and what you do, you should have to wait in line like everyone else. That was extremely bad customer service and left a bad taste in my mouth...until I munched on my sandwich.", "author": "Diane M."}

As I was strolling down the street, three dudes walked by eating the most delicious looking banh-mi I'd ever seen.  When I asked where their sandwiches came from, they said \"see the place with the line down the street? it's called Saigon Sandwich, and it's amazing!\" -- Amazing it was. The line was deceptive, it moved a lot faster than one might expect, so don't let that dissuade you from stopping by. I had the roast pork banh mi, and it was truly a miracle on a bun.  There was just enough fresh jalapeno on the bun to create a warmth in your mouth, without overpowering those who are more faint-of-heart when it comes to spiciness. Also, although other banh mi I've had have mayo on the bun - the only fat on this bun seemed to be the juices from the delicious roast pork (and a yellow substance - possibly mustard?) - ensuring that it was both moist and flavorful.  The cilantro and shredded carrots added just the right amount of crunch and freshness. Yummmmm. If I could move to San Franscisco today, I'm pretty sure I'd rent a place down the street from Saigon Sandwich just so I could eat there on a daily basis.", "author": "Allison Z."}

He has been researching Vietnamese sandwiches for around a month, and talking about this place non-stop, so it was a no brainer. We went around 5pm, as they close early and we were starving. The ambiance is that of a total dump. It looks like a seedy convenience store from the street. The owner is in the back toasting the French baguette rolls. The woman at the register assembles the sandwiches and very efficiently rings you up. The menu is small. Only around 6 or 7 kinds of sandwiches. They offer chicken, 2 kinds of pork, ham, pate, and tofu as the protein, and the veggies are pretty much what you get in a good fresh Vietnamese salad: a julienne carrot and daikon radish marinade with that nice sweet flavor. We got the special combination, which included roast pork, steamed pork, and pate. The first bite had my eyes sparkly wide and I was suffused with childish enthusiasm at the prospect of a whole sandwich full of bites ahead of me. The bread was warm and crisp, the flavors were a perfect marriage, WOW! I can see why they won the Citysearch best sandwich in SF award for 2008. There are two seats only, in the window. We sat there and watched a steady stream of patrons come and go...one with a giant bag full of sandwiches. The price ranges from $3 (most sandwiches) to $3.50 for the special combo we had. I woke up this morning feeling happy that now, every time I go to SF I can get take out. Mmmmmm good! Here I am a few months later. I have downgraded it from 5 to 3 stars. The reason is this. The last time I went there, a woman was sleeping with her cheek in her sandwich in the window. When the owner finally shooed her out, we had our sandwiches. Maybe it was partially the distustingness of the neighborhood, and the lady snoozing in the sandwich that got me, but it was certainly also the fact that some kind of chewy slimy things of an unidentifiable nature were in it. It still tasted great, but once I know my food is compromised, I can't feel the same way anymore.", "author": "Barbara S."}

Its worth going through the scuzzy area of the Tenderloin.  Hell, if you're in the area for meth and vd and get hungry, then this is super convenient.\n     My only problem with the place is based around a cultural difference.  If you are American you know to stand in a line.  Some foreign-born Asians (mostly older ones) are not familiar with this concept, so if some show up a line can easily turn into a clusterf**k and the line can get really tense.  It doesn't help that when an American points this out the offender pretends not to know English (or perhaps really doesn't).  I have been here a few times where it got pretty close to riot level.  And if you speak vietnamese you can usually shout something out to the women in the back and get your order first, even if you just showed up.  \n     In short, if you are an American with a short fuse do not go here, but if you are patient you will be rewarded with cheap, tasty goodness.", "author": "Sean B."}

They've been in business at this little hole in the wall for over 20 years. My mom used to share recipes with the original owners who started this place. I have to agree with most reviewers that the banh mi's here are something special. you'll not find it like this anywhere else. Ususally in other vietnamese communitites in bay area/san jose, so cal, dont serve it this heartily. Its ususally offered a lower price and much lighter on the meats and sauce or no sauce at all and on a cheaper bread, not the crusty baguette. but then again, the prices for bahn mi's are ususually $1 or at the most, $2 elsewhere. Banh Mi's for $3 is unheard of, and most vietanmese banh mi goers will agree. But its definately worth a re-visit once in while. The sauce in the sandwiches here is like nothing else - thats what makes it so special and tastey. I'd give it one more star for perfect rating if the prices were more competitive.", "author": "Mai T."}

Even though its super cramped and kinda grimy. They can whip it out like nothing even with just two people. They toast the bread just right and don't skimp out on the pickled carrots. Another thing they don't skimp out is the pork patty, my FAVORITE! For just a couple bucks you gotta try everything. They have the combo sandwich, the bbq pork, the bbq chicken, the ham sandwich. As you can see pork is the key meat. They have desserts in there too. Those are pretty good. Especially the green jelly thing. Grab an asian drink like chrysanthemum or coconut to go with it. It will make your experience different from just a soda. Word of advice...just let them add everything even the jalapenos. Take em out afterward if you can't eat stand it.

And since then, I have been on a manhunt for the best sandwich in the city, jumping out of cars in the TL and eating them with friends while stopped at red lights.  I still haven't tried every vietamese sandwich place in the city, but this place is good, very good.    Warning: this place is not clean.  But you have to ignore the dirt on the floor, the grease on the ceiling, and the fact that the same woman who takes your money is the one that makes your sandwiches without using gloves, because... the sandwiches are simply delish.  I went to pick up four sandwiches before meeting my friend for a movie at the metreon.  Why four?  Well, he wanted two, and I wanted one for dinner, and one to save for lunch the next day.  We had the combo, grilled chicken, and two grilled pork.  To be honest, I couldn't tell which one was the chicken or pork, and I tried them both, but they were both delish...nicely cooked with a hint of peppery flavor.  The pate was sweet and just enough, not too much or too little.  Most importantly, the bread was fresh and crispy, with a soft inside.  For $2.50 a sammy, that's not a bad deal at all.  \n\nPicture this: sitting in Yerba Buena with four sandwiches, drinks purchased from your local walgreens, the sun is shining, and your friend is talking to you with a mouthful of pate and meat hanging from his mouth...nice.  \n\nNote: the sandwiches do not keep well for a next-day meal.  Lesson learned: I should have just eaten both sandwiches like my friend.", "author": "Grace C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-13", "description": "I am not used to writing reviews for places but felt I do this one.  Last time, I logged into my yelp, it gave me a list of reviews just written and the top review was for Saigon Sandwich on Larkin.  I had seen their name in yelp searches because it comes up way close to the top for having too many good reviews but always assumed they got lots of good reviews because they were cheap and people were being nice to grade them good all the time.  The first line of this review stated how delicious the roast pork sandwich has been, etc.  I decided to check it so I can check my own assumptions about their high score and if the food is really that good.  I did today and it turned out almost as I had expected.  The place is a small space with room for a few people to stand and maybe a couple to sit comfortably.  It is well-stocked and the two ladies behind the counter moved (almost ran) to do orders.  Every person in there was ordering multiple sandwiches ($3 for 90% of them) and once the line cleared, I was at counter when the tall fat guy in front of me ordered.  He wanted 3 pork sandwiches and went to sit.  He came back later to add a meatball also and his soda and they were all togo.  But he sat and started eating them there.  I ordered the world-famous roast pork togo and nothing else.  I expected it to be a typical Vietnamese sandwich and it was.  White roll with enough hot roast pork to make a medium size sandwich and the vegetables that make it Vietnamese.  I avoid white bread but the sandwich was good.  I wouldn't eat two nor would head here just for it.  I put it on my no-destination list.  Sometimes, a person has no specific destination and wander.  If someday I end up there this way, I have nothing against eating there but I don't know if it is worth going all the way there.  If a person eats more than one, he/she just gets a lot of bread.  Not??? I gave them 4 stars because they do a good job as a business start to finish but the food is not awesome.  Some simple sandwich places kick ass and I have to give them credit by holding one star here.  Try it.", "author": "Cush D."}

I always get everything in it, but one thing I didn't know they put in here is Jalapeno peppers. I mean, I love spicy food, and jalapeno's included...but vietnamese jalapeno peppers are something else. For some reason, they are like on crack...they are so anti'd up in spice that in burns. When I bit into this sandwich, I was just glorified...bang for the buck, I love it! But as I bit into it and got to the Jalapeno's which I didn't know were in here...my tongue started to burn and my cousin who was driving was just laughing at me and his younger brother as we needed water...which we didn't have any and suffered through the agony of a burning tongue.

Wow, 5 Banh Mi shops within a 3 block radius- and I'm sure I even missed a couple. Truly we are blessed in this city with such bounty of a cheap and truly brilliant sandwich. I don't know how I lived before I discovered Banh Mi. $2.50? I still feel like I'm getting away with something sometimes. So ok, so I love and praise all Banh Mi. That being said, out of the places I've tried I like Saigon the best (Wrap delight second). After sampling everything on the menu I have settled on the pork meatball sandwich, as it is more consistent than the roast pork or roast chicken, which are wonderful about 80% of the time, unless you get a mouth full of gristle. My vegetarian girlfriend prefers their more moist style of tofu to the dry shredded variety offered at wrap delight and baguette express. The special combination here is a bit overwhelming... if you're looking for that exotic combination of pates and various other meats that some say is the only TRUE vietnamese sandwich, I would recomment sing sing sandwich on hyde between eddy and ellis... they make a darn good one, (and it's the only kind of sandwich they make!!)
