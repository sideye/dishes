I had the Victorian punch and it was amazingly good. Great coconut and cranberry flavor and could taste that kick of rum. Would definitely be back to try the others. \n\nOn a side note, would have given 5 stars but there was a really bad piss smell at the bar.

Order a few rounds of punch bowls to share.. these things are deceptive, it's sweet so you keep drinking without realizing you're getting tipsy. Wish the ladles worked better and didn't spill all over as you tried to pour the drinks.\n\nIf you get a chance, sit by one of the tables with the large windows facing Haight Street and you can people watch too. Every now and then you'll see a SF Sightseeing tourist bus pass by. Hobson's Choice is one of those places where you can spend hours and have a great time. Hungry? Head next door to Street Tacos and bring back some al Pastor nachos or a burrito. The bar is pretty nice about letting you bring outside food since they don't have a food menu. Just be a good customer and keep ordering those punches.", "author": "Ruby C."}

I asked a random person where I could find an eclectic neighborhood and possibly have a midday drink with locals. They pointed me to the Haight neighborhood and I stumbled across this bar and copped a squat at the bar. \n\nIt has a divey yet welcoming vibe so it was comfortable. I'm not usually a rum drinker but I'm sucker for bars with old charm who also serve drinks from antique punch bowls. I can definitely see this being a fun place for a group of friends.\n\nI was served immediately, mostly because there were 6 of us there, including the bartender. However, he was friendly so it's probably the case all the time. I tried the House Punch which has an orange/mango base and the Victorian Punch which has a cranberry/coconut base. Both were tasty and had kick but I preferred the Victorian as I found it less thick than the House version. Regardless, they paired well with the random conversation I had with the bartender and a patron...which is precisely what I was seeking. \n\nIf back in that area, I'd definitely go back to see what it's like on a busier day/night.", "author": "Kristin A."}

There are 3 flavors in 2 sizes- my favorite being the Victorian Punch made with silver, coconut, and pineapple rums. \nA small bowl is good for 2-4 people. \nThe large bowl is good for 4-6. \n\nI like going upstairs when it's available... you have almost an entire wing of the house to yourself with a large table and a flat screen TV. Fits a group of about 6-10 friends for happy hour (good deals!)\n\nNow, I would also like to acknowledge the recent 1 star reviews about what happens at the end of the night.... It's true. I've seen it and I've experienced it. So I would avoid this place about 30 minutes before closing time since the staff suddenly flips- becoming excessively aggressive and rude in telling people to finish their drinks and get out.

I believe wells were included somewhere in there..but I can't quite remember. BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT AND GET THE PUNCH!

Hobson's specializes in \"Victorian Punch Bowls\" which are delicious, sugary-fruity rum mixtures, perfect for sharing. They offer three varieties, but my personal favorite is the Victorian, which is a blend of three rums (silver, coconut and pineapple) + Cranberry/Pineapple juice. It reminds me of a naughty pink lemonade in color and flavor. \n\nA small bowl is perfect for two people-- at $18, it makes it a steal. I'm not quite sure how strong a bowl is-- considering that they have three super large bowls of pre-made punches that they use to serve customers. I suppose it depends on whoever made it. Regardless, you feel like you're getting a good deal as it's easy to keep refilling your own glass. \n\nThe space itself is spacious in the front, with large windows, perfect for people-watching. Or, you could find yourself tucked in the back corners or upstairs for something more quiet. That being said, it's more of a dive bar environment, lest you think its name as a \"Victorian Punch Bar\" would produce something more quaint. Plus, they have plenty of TVs, meaning those looking for a sports game will probably find it on here.", "author": "Bryan B."}

I wasn't drunk. I might have been tipsy. I was definitely happy. I think the drinks here legit made me a better person.

And let's be real, this is San Francisco... there are far worse smells than dirty bar rag that we could be smelling. \n\nMy girl Dana G and I had a blast getting lubed up here before letting loose in The Haight and honestly, I totally prefer the punch here to the cocktails at Alembic.", "author": "Candice G."}

It was pretty relaxed and most of the patrons kept to themselves.  There were a few people at the bar talking to one another, a small group intently watching a game, some other people here and there.. and then there was our group.  I honestly thought it would be a bit more lively.. come on people!!  It's a Thursday night and there's an awesome happy hour.. WAKE UP!!!\n\nRum seems to be their specialty here.  They are famous for their rum punch.  The House punch is a blend of silver rum, mango, orange and pineapple juices, and the Victorian punch is a silver, coconut, and pineapple rums blended with a cranberry-pineapple juice.  I kept asking my friends whether or not they tasted alcohol in my drink because I couldn't taste it at all!  It was awesome!  But after a while, I started to feel a bit warmer..  DANGEROUS!  It's like drinking jungle juice at a frat party..  you just don't know until it hits you like a train later on!  \n\nI was also quite please to see Carlsberg on their beer list.  I don't think I've seen that beer on tap in the U.S.  I first fell in love with it in Scotland, and I have missed it ever so much.  I also heard their tangerine beer is pretty awesome, so I'll have to try it out next time.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty chill place to grab a drink.

When he later came to clear the glasses from our table, he didn't greet us or ask us how it was -- even though we were the only customers in the entire bar at that point. I don't know what his deal was. I didn't get the feeling he was just having a bad day.\n\nAsking for the ratio of alcohol to non-alcohol in the punch (so I'd know how much I can drink and drive safely) was answered with \"about 3 to 1\". He confirmed that was 3 parts alcohol to 1 part non-alcohol. Have you ever had 3 ounces of rum with 1 ounce of juice? It would taste horrible. I estimate the ratio was more akin to 1:4 or 1:5 -- i.e. it was weak. We each had 4 glasses of this punch. It tasted fine, but we didn't feel much.\n\nThe music was good -- 80's rock.

Whenever I am feeling particularly fruity, I head here for some terribly strong rum drink that tastes great and rocks my world. Last night I went here with a group of friends for a long awaited Mai Tai. My Mai Tai was stellar. My second drink was also great, BUT:\n\nThe door guy / guy clearing glasses grabbed my half-full $8.00 drink and threw a napkin in it. I checked with my table mates to see if I was crazy, and they all confirmed that I had plenty of drink left. When I asked him if I could have my drink back, he spilled some of what was left onto the table and immediately went on the defensive. He asked me if I really wanted my \"lemons and alcohol back.\" I did, since I ordered a Caipirinha, which is sugar, rum, and lime. I politely told him I did not want his free drink, and this is where things got bat crap crazy.\n\nHe brought me a cup of sweet and sour mix with limes lining the rim of the glass. Lame. Hobson's Choice, you're always so good to me, but this time was terrible. The three people I brought to the bar were horrified by the way this guy acted. He was unbelievably rude to us and mean-mugged me the whole time. GET RID OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HANDLE SERVING OTHER PEOPLE! I worked at bars, clearing tables, and etc. for a long time, and it is not hard to be a decent human being to them. Particularly since you are basically being bribed by the establishment to be pleasant. Be nice to your customers.

Now - the rum punches are not really my thing, but we had to try them, and they were quite good for what they are.  My companion liked the Victorian Punch a little better than my perhaps too sweet House Punch.\n\nHopped up on sugar and despairing of the beer list ( they have an okay set of taps - Anchor, SN, and even Humboldt, but it's not a niche microbrew place ) we thought to ask for their drinks menu ... and found Rum flights.  Not just *one* rum flight, but a rather large selection of flights, attractively priced.  My companion opted for a nice and amazingly quickly poured Dark and Stormy.  I asked for the Martinique rum flight.\n\nThe bartender, who had previously been nice but abrupt, suddenly because solicitous and effusive in her explanation of the various rums in the flight.  Helpful and informative lists were produced.  Three very different rums from French colonies were produced and consumed, bottles set in front of us.  And a somewhat sketchy-looking Haight street bar suddenly transformed itself ... for just a moment ... into a rum aficionado's tasting room.\n\nSo yeah - past your slightly over 21 groups getting drunk on rum punch, past your guys drinking light lager and watching the game, what you have here is a surprisingly good bar with folks who are actually interested in and passionate about their craft.", "author": "Albert H."}

Hobson's Choice is a Victorian Rum House, and although there is nothing immediately Victorian about it, it is spectacular.  Allegedly, they have the largest selection of this elixir of the Gods of any bar in the country, and I believe it!  I started counting, but when I reached #110 and was only on the letter 'M', I decided to just accept the truth of the statement and have some rum.  The rums are assorted by country of origin, and change weekly.\n\nIn the true tradition of the dive bar, they don't scrimp on the alcohol.  During their Happy Hour, which runs from 5p.m.-7p.m., Monday through Friday, they have $3.00 rum punch drinks, served up in pint sized glasses.  A new addition is that they now serve food and bar treats from the Asquew Grill, also on Haight Street.\n\nVenture upstairs. Here you will find shabby, frayed couches, oversized chairs, chandeliers, dining room tables, and a television. The room itself is cozy with lots of windows and walls that have been painted and patched a few too many times. It's a mish-mash of eclectic vibes and aromas from decades past. Hobson's Choice is a must see and must drink in the Haight. For pictures and more information, check out my blog: http://thenoisebeneaththeapple.com/", "author": "Heather J."}

We were going to go with option 2 since we felt we could hit that no problem with about 20-30 people going. However, here comes the real AWESOME part. When they found out the number of people we had, they said that we would have no problem hitting that minimum so we could just have the room for free! No pressure of any minimums, etc. He said to just let him know when we were there and he could clear out the upstairs area if it was occupied. How sweet! Good customer service really goes a long way. We got there super early...probably the earliest I've ever been out in SF lol...around 9pm and they had all these signs around the upstairs area saying the room was reserved for a private event. Awww!\n\nThe punch was really good and hit the spot. Plus, there was plenty of parking so everyone who came was able to park without stress. I will be back.

The night continues, this particular bartender spends his time between the back of the bar and on the other side of the bar dancing with a trio of drunken white girls. During this time my friend orders a beer from the other bartender with no problem. A little while later the jackass comes from behind the bar and gets in my friends face saying I just cut you off why are you still drinking\"? \"This is my bar, and I cut you off\", he says. I tried to tell him the other bartender served him so that is an issue he should be taking up with him. He tells me he isn't going to argue with me and repeats his previous statements. ( all while raising his voice) He forces my friend to chug his beer then snatches it out of his hand.

Sure, the punch is cheap at happy hour but I'm pretty sure there's no rum in it.  I was never even able to obtain a substantial buzz from it.  It's sickeningly sweet too, so I might as well just make some Kool-Aid.\n5.  If it's not happy hour, the drinks are pretty pricey.\n6.  Filthy, filthy bathrooms.\n7.  NASTY attitude from the staff. \n\nWHY I'LL NEVER RETURN\nOn my last visit, I opened a tab and put all of my drinks and food on it.  Nothing unusual there.  When I closed my tab, my card was charged and before I signed the draft, I looked over my receipts.  My food order was charged tax, and the total amount (incl tax) was added to my alcohol bill, which was then taxed again - including the alcohol.  So I pointed this out to the bartender, who said he'd take care of it.  He said he had to get his manager to fix it, since my card had already been charged, and here is where things got ugly.\n\nThe bartender went to find the manager, told me it would be a minute, and went to help someone else.  While I'm waiting, I hear a man yelling.  There's a huge black dude sitting at the end of the bar, yelling at the cracked out lookin' lady next to him.  I assumed he was yelling AT the lady, because he's yelling things like, \"CHEAP BITCH!......DAMN!......OVER THREE DOLLARS!!!!\" and then he'd laugh in disbelief a couple times and say \"DAMN\" a few times and then things like \"THAT'S A CHEAP ASS BITCH!.....DON'T WANNA PAY THREE DOLLARS.\"  \n\n....crackhead lady ordered a three dollar drink and didn't have any money, right?\n\nWRONG!  I was MORTIFIED when this man got up and I saw he was wearing a Hobson's t-shirt.  Turns out he was the \"manager.\"  He walked over to me, THREW five dollar bills on the bar, laughed in my face and said \"You wanna argue about three dollars? Well here's five!\" and walked away.  He was still laughing when he sat down next to his crackhead friend about the \"CHEAP BITCH......DOESN'T WANNA PAY THREE DOLLARS.\"\n\nSo, Hobson's Choice, you overcharged my credit card and rather than fix YOUR mistake, your \"manager\" calls me a cheap ass bitch to the other customers at the bar!  That's GREAT!", "author": "Elmer C."}

I went here to meet some friends with Frances S. and we were only there with maybe 6 people total. We were standing, talking, trying to order from the bar, when over the loud obnoxious music that eventually ended up given my friend a throbbing headache, we heard an even more obnoxious sound----the sound of a screamingly painful waitress who claimed we were blocking her walkway. \n\nUmmmmm...I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to push your way through bar patrons??? Why would you work at an overly crowded bar in the first place, if you weren't going to be willing to push through people every now and then?????

It isn't every day that you see a bar with that type of personal tribute.\n\nThey do have these summer punch specials which are premade punches in three flavors that you get in fun hurricane glasses which always makes you feel fancy, and it especially does in a place like this.\n\nBasically you need to be drunk to be here....And if you are really drunk, and I mean you can barely walk drunk, they don't care.

We were having a great time until out LIVES WERE THREATENED by a group of street people who were also drinking in the bar. They had left a cell phone charging  next to the table we were at and a few people looked to see what the deal was with the phone and the street people came over and threatened our safety on Haight street. We told them that we didn't want any trouble and definitely were not trying to steal their phone, but they continued to verbally threaten our safety. They complained to the bouncers about us and the staff came over and were extremely rude to us and threatened to kick us out! We felt so uncomfortable that we left the bar, of course complaining to the manager and explaining the situation. We made sure that we all walked home together and that no one followed us. I am not a person who often feels threatened by others or uncomfortable in the city, but I legitimately was nervous to walk home because the people were so aggressive towards us and the bar staff was so unsupportive of its patrons who were obviously there to enjoy themselves and not cause any trouble.

The reason is, the crowd here is usually rowdy, young, and kinda thuggish. There always seems to be at least one table with 6 dudes, drinking, not talking, and staring everyone else down. Sometimes there are multiple groups like this, staring each other down. I don't know if I just had a few isolated bad experiences, but I always feel like somebody is staring at somebody when I'm in here.\n\nWhich is a shame, because I really enjoy the fruity drinks they serve here.", "author": "Rachel H."}

You know, a bar where every one knows my name (and my favorite drink) and where I can easily stumble home from after a Tuesday night binge fest.\n\nHobson's Choice is a strong candidate for my favorite local bars in the Haight-Ashbury. This place has everything I want in a regular hang out spot, not too dingy or too dive-y, but also not too douche-y and pretentious.  \n\nHobson's is known for their famous punch bowls. It reminds me of the spiked punched served at my junior prom, oh the memories. The punch bowl is the perfect drink to get if you have a large group of people. It is also good drink to start your night off with. It is also the perfect drink to get if you want to play Macho Mug, arguably the world's best drinking game (Google it my friends).\n\nThe punch is very sweet and not too harsh, so even the lightest of drinkers can down ladles and ladles of this stuff. Be careful because this is a creeper drink. The drink is pretty sweet and doesn't taste like alcohol at all, so you think you can drink a lot of it and then BAM you are blacked out on a sidewalk with 20 missed calls. \n\nIf you are more of beer drinker then you are pleased to know that they have a variety of beers on tap, including one of my all time favorites, the Tangerine Wheat made by Lost Coast Brewery. \n\nOverall, Hobson's Choice is cool low key bar, definitely one of my favorite local hang out spots. I especially love sitting upstairs in their giant throne size chairs, it makes me feel oh so regal!", "author": "Allan Y."}

I came here ordered the Victorian Punch but saw the gogo ginger!!! ahh it's ok i'll definitely come back to try that one! \n\nVictorian Punch ($35) wasn't that sweet or strong at the initial sip. I had who knows maybe 3-4 glasses since my friend kept refilling the glass. My bf claimed the drink to be really sweet with all the kinds of rum in it. At first we thought dang $35 that's a lot and then when you break it down the average drink there is about $8-9 so mind as well! We definitely got our $35 dollars worth.\n\nWe sat at the corner, bought some pizza from Escape from New York and just chatted it up.

Make your own bloody marys it appears.  For about $8 the bartender was pouring almost 2 oz. of vodka into tall tumblers of ice, and which patrons then used to mix their own to taste, with a huge layout of options that made me wonder how many ways one could make a bloody mary.  \n\nThis turned out to be a small bar, with a few tables out front, a small lounge in the back, and another small seating area upstairs.  Traffic was low, it being Sunday afternoon, but the bartender was rushing around like it was 5pm on Friday.  Phoning the \"kitchen\" for orders, pouring punch, pouring vodka.  Rush, rush, rush.  \n\nPhoning the kitchen?  Yes.  Customers placed orders for food through the bartender, who would grab a cell phone and call some mysterious delivery service.  He'd then hand the customer a table number and tell him to pay the server when the food appeared.  And by the way, they were out of hamburgers.  What?  Oh, I read in another review that the \"kitchen\" is Asqew Grill.  \n\nIt's a little bizarre, it all is.

When I lived in San Francisco, this used to be one of my favorite bars.  I've only been away fro 2 1/2 years, it shouldn't change that much!  Here are the points of interest:\n\n1.  The service is mediocre at best.  It is kind of a red flag when your waitress stands outside with the bouncer, talking and socializing, when she should be inside, doing her job.  Especially when I can't get her attention through the window...not cool.  \n\n2.  Their drinks are pretty small.  Their signature drink is supposed to be a mojito, and it was served to my friend in a small glass.  Mojitos are supposed to be served in a tall glass.  This reminds me of businesses trying to cut costs at the expense of product quality.\n\n3.  The bathrooms are FILTHY!  I know its a bar, but it isn't a dive!  I can expect the bathrooms to be that way at other places, but here?  No way!\n\nSo, why does Hobson's Choice deserve only 1 start?  Simple...They ripped my friend off.  From the $20 minimum (which restaurants technically can't do) to the fact that they charged extra $ onto her card without her authorization.  This is a really bad business practice.  Needless to say, I will NEVER go back to this place again, and I don't suggest you do either.", "author": "Traci L."}

I used to come here a lot after work for a few of their signature punches coworkers, but after getting blamed for making a comment about a bartender's lack of a \"tipping shirt,\" and then accidentally although looking totally on purpose spilling a drink on that same bartender, I stopped going so often.  However, I went yesterday, and it was just as I remembered.\n\nSadly we got here a little before 1pm, only to find they didn't open until 2.  We went to Murio's down the street for a while, and then came back.\n\nThey have a range of different specialty alcoholic punches that change daily, but their daily staple is the victorian, which I can't get enough of.  It has cranberry juice and coconut rum, and I'm not sure what else, along with a rum floater I add for mine.  Delicious stuff.   And at the end of the bar we usually sit at, theres some couches along the window, and that whole little area is perfect for people watching.  All kinds of people walk by and/or wait at the bus stop right outside.  Hours of free entertainment.\n\nThe punches with a rum floater are $8, which is totally worth it.  Unfortunately their happy hour doesnt start until 5pm, but after that, I think the price drops to only $4 or $5-- a steal!  \n\nThis time I actually ended up getting a little bit of food, an order of mac n cheese, which actually comes from a place a couple doors down, something Askew I think.  It was nothing compared to the mac n cheese I had at The Tee Off the day before (although it was also $10 cheaper.)  It was alright for $4 though.

We camped out upstairs where we were told we'd actually be able to hear the game, or more accurately the vuvuzelas.  All was well, drinks were flowing, crowd was friendly and jovial - then we started hearing fans in the back portion of the lower bar cheering or moaning about ten seconds before a huge play.  Are they that good at predicting what was going to happen, you ask?  No.  Turns out one crappy non-flat screen t.v. had a signal about 7-9 seconds ahead of the rest of the t.v.'s.  That really, really sucks when you are watching \"live\" sports.   We devised a plan where if anything remotely exciting happened, we'd yell real loud to try and drown out the dozens of fans down below who would be reacting to the excitement before the other 75% of the people in the bar.  \n\nLong and short - nice bar, slightly rude pretentious bartenders, good fish bowl booze.

If there's a gang that wears orange turtlenecks, I was its leader.\n\n* Speaking of the jukebox, it's one of my favorites in the city. Though someone kept playing \"No Woman No Cry\" on Valentine's Day last night, which was a bit much.\n\n* They have an upstairs level that no one seems to know about, and it's way less crowded up there.

I know the British Navy captured Jamaica and drank a lot of rum in the 1600s, but it seems that you would want to go for a more Caribbean/pirate theme if you wanted to be historically correct. Or, maybe, you could serve us up some absinthe since that was so popular in the Victorian era. How about that Mr. Hobson? \n\nOh, and while you are changing legislature to make that happen could you also whip up some cleaning solution for your furniture and rugs? I am not sure \"historically correct\" needs to include stains and dirt accumulated since the Victorian era. But, hey, after a few rum cocktails I will just slink upstairs and forget that this is a Victorian themed bar anyhow.

It was fruity and good and had about a thousand maraschino cherries at the bottom.  We sat in the rear near the bathrooms, a cozy corner that would have been perfect except for the strange wasted person from AZ who kept stopping by to drink punch while licking the ladle.  Really gross!!  The music was chill and the crowd seemed 30ish.  It got younger as the night wore on.  We had no trouble hailing a cab at the end of the evening.  A fun time with a memorable bowl of punch!", "author": "Anne B."}

For starters if you are a rum drinker, this is your bar. There are over a hundred types here. However last time I was in and asked the bartender for Coyopa he looked at me funny and explained that he had just started and didn't think they carried it. (It's not like it's a difficult bottle to spot out--the bottle itself plays Calypso music and lights up people dancing) Still it is a full bar and they make other concoctions. Their Bloody Marys get about a 6 on the Veronica scale, which by all accounts is promising. Most of the cocktails are on the lower end of the financial spectrum so that's good news to my wallet plus they have an ok happy hour.\n\nRecently, they updated some of their furniture which I actually found disorientating. However, they still have that funky Victorian feel to the bar so that's reassuring. They have an old school table top Ms. PacMan for 50 cents a play and that makes me happy. Also apparently, you can bring your dog in with you because I've seen more than one four legged friend in here.

Nevertheless though the crowd is mixed with college kids, just got out of college kids and late 20s, early 30s professionals, everyone there was having a great time (well except for a trio of kids sitting on a couch on the path to the upstairs, frowning at everyone but it was obvious they weren't drinking enough.  Who frowns at a bar when there is alcohol flowing?)  \n\nThe downstairs has the bar, some sit down video games, couches and seats and a jukebox.  Upstairs is a balcony overlooking the downstairs, another video game, couches, and a round table for a group of people to sit and chat and drink.  \n\nThe specialty of the place is the rum punch.  The specialty is the rum in general.  They have the house punch and also the newer version, I think it was the Victorian punch.  Either way, both were good, but then again I love fruity drinks.  For the 3 of us we had 7 beers, and 2 punches before we left, and the tab was only $40.  Cheap drinks, no wonder so many college kids were there.  \n\nIt is a fun atmosphere, lots of people having fun, drinking and hanging out.  For a Friday, it was packed, slightly nuts to butts but not too bad.  I've been in more crowded bars.  As were were leaving though a gaggle of college girls came in which is fine and dandy for the college boys and men that like college girls but for me that was the perfect time to leave and check out another bar.  \n\nSo if you're looking for a good selection of rums and college girls this is definitely your place.  If you're looking for cheap drinks and a cozy place to hang out this is also your place.  \n\nI would come back anytime before it gets too crowded, for drinking maybe between 8-midnight......then it gets so crowded you can't move and it's not as fun.\n\nUpdated 2/11/2008\nCame on a Sunday after brunch in the Haight, and this was the perfect place to sit down at a table, get some skewers from Asquew Grill (long wait though) , have some drinks and people watch.

I saw these two super drunk girls verbally assaulting a patron and one of them even threw a pen at the bartender, he kicked them out but the most vitriolic one came back in and began severely harassing and again verbally assaulting the patron--the patron seemed unfazed and sober and had a couple of friends around her trying to deter her from the verbal assault by the visibly drunk girl--(who was being the most hateful person I have ever seen in a bar) but the grey haired bartender would not kick her out b/c the regulars said he wants to eat her ass so bad his head is about to explode. If the owner/s (not sure if it is a man or woman, I've heard it changed hands recently) would be cool with this..... Otherwise, i am going to stay away for a while. The two drunk women ultimately cleared out the entire bar, I saw at least 25 people walk out as all this progressed over about 30 minutes of screaming from these two girls! The patron that was assaulted finally just gave up and left after the girl continued to scream at her. I think that was a terrible dis-service to the owner/s, because, like I said, this is an amazingly fun place.", "author": "B F."}

While we were waiting he literally started yelling at this family who wandered in there to catch the score of the game with their 2 10-year old kids, that \"KIDS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE BAR, MAAM.\"  I thought that was weird that he got so nasty with them but understood kids weren't allowed. Then it was my turn:   We waited patiently for a seat to open up in the bar.  When 2 stools opened we stepped up to sit down and order drinks.  I, being obviously pregnant (and showing) didn't have my ID, nor did I intend on ordering a drink. He basically started yelling at us, much like he did the other family.  I understand the law but this guy was just an a-hole. No other word for him.  He could have presented his \"rules\" in a different way. I will never ever effing ever return to this bar.

I am very picky about the way a Bloody Mary is made and I love me some Bloody Mary's!   This DIY Bloody Mary Bar on Sundays is the perfect solution for my dilemma.  I think it's around $5 for the glass with ice and well vodka.  I suggest well vodka as all the flavors in a bloody mary completely overpower the taste of the liquor anyhow.  The fixings include a choice of tomato juice or clamato juice, or a pre-made bloody mary mix, various hot sauces / steak sauces / worsteshire sauce, garlic, limes, lemons, pickled artichoke hearts, pickled beets, pickled peppers, hearts of palm, olives, salts / peppers, celery stalks.  I proceed to fill up my glass with as much as possible....oh the deliciousness!  One word of caution...the first time I went here it was a female bartender and she was very skimpy on the bartender.

Lots of punch and fruity rum drinks for the ladies as well ;).  I used to go more regularly when the bartender Chance was there, but now the bartending staff is not as good.  He would make caipirinhas with well muddled limes.  And was generous with his pours of the XO rums... haha.\r\nMy favorite rums I had there (in order):\r\n1) Mount Gay XO.  Easily as good as some single malts out there.  very complicated, smooth, not too sweet, and just tasty overall\r\n2) Pyrat XO.  Really sweet and caramelly but gave me a nasty hangover the next day\r\n3) Brugal XO.  Harsher than mount gay, but still good.\r\nand I can't remember the names of the other two, but they just weren't as good.\r\n4) Appleton Estate XO.  Not quite as smooth as the Mount Gay--it wasn't quite as complicated, and the finish was not quite as smooth and lasting.  But still not bad.\r\nSo they lose a star for music that's not my favorite, and because Chance isn't there to pour drinks for me anymore\r\n\r\nUPDATE 6/24/06----------\r\nDamn, there were a LOT of hotties here tonight.... wow.  Lots of birthday celebrations going on, but it was still quite cool.  So the last time I was here and got a caipirinha, the bartender Laith barely muddled the limes and passed it to me.  That was quite disappointing.  TONIGHT, I thought I'd chance it again, and Laith followed through with flying colors, making a perfectly muddled caipirinha.  I was impressed.  He also made me a \"brain damage\" aka \"brain hemmorhage\" aka \"the abortion\" despite him warning me about it...hahahaha, lots of girls were grossed out by it, but it was worth it.  Didn't taste too bad, except the texture....  The drink is a shot with peach schnapps poured in first, with baileys layered on top.  Then you dribble a little bit of grenadine right in the middle, forcing some of the baileys into the schnapps, which curdles the baileys.  The grenadine then sits at the bottom, looking a lot like blood.... yeah...totally awesome!  hahahaha  gross, but quite the spectacle.  Laith made it perfectly.

(ps, dogs are such dude magnets, what's the deal, can't talk to us directly just our dogs?  sorry, tangent)  I was dissapointed to find that the only available table had a heap of dirty dishes and a super sticky surface to bat.  Eventually someone cleaned it up, but not until I was half way through my beer.  I mean, do they even serve food here?  It was weird.  My beer was pretty good and I enjoyed the orange slice embellishment.  The crowd was pretty lively and cool for a Sunday, except for the drunk guy who kept coming over to grab at Marley (dog) and spill his beer all over his head...that was a little weird.  All in all, this is an average bar that allows dogs...I will not be there again, until Aunty Claire is dog sitting Mr. Marley and needs a drink.", "author": "Claire C."}

Figuring we'd all like to have a very David Lynchian Christmas Eve, the bf and I and the last remnants of our urban family left in town decided to head down to Aub Zam Zam for a bevvie. Cue lots of deep conversations about literature and whatnot, peppered with self-reflection about what the last year had brought. Cut to the swinging lone red overhead light. Fade to the drunk homeless person who snatched tips from the bar and took off like Marion Jones never could. Split screen of drunk bartender pursuing drunk homeless person and dragging her back and dapper old man passing out at bar. All this while the jukebox was wailing about somebody done somebody wrong. Too David Lynchian, even for me.\n\nThen picture the contrast of arriving at Hobson's Choice after that scene. Hobson's that looks and feels like an amalgamation of every crappy off-campus apartment people hung out in, complete with battered furniture and hideous flocked wallpaper and stopped-up toilet. Hobson's with its year-round delicious punch that tastes as good after a long day of summery daytime drinking as it does on a wet Christmas Eve. Hobson's that allows the cute puppies to come in and hang out with the mixture of frat boys, hipsters and regular joes. Hobson's that molds itself to whatever you want your night out to be. You want to buy a bowl of punch and get suckered into thinking it has no effect? Knock yourself out! (Just wait until the fresh air hits you and you go from sober to knee-walking drunk in 60 seconds.) You want to sit on a battered couch and talk baseball? Please do! You want to play some tunes on the great jukebox and bs with the bartender? Why not! A great place to start or end a night depending on how much punch you want to have.", "author": "Leah S."}

Bartenders are chill. There's even a old-school arcade machine across from the bar.\n\nIt gets 4 stars from me because I like the place, but it loses that one star because it can get packed, and because the music ain't that great (but hey you can ALWAYS change it on that machine). Aside from the crowd, I honestly dislike some of the yuppies who show up trying to act hard.\n\nOverall Hobson's is okay, 4-star worthy don't get me wrong, mainly because the drinks are pretty good.\n\nAddition: I'm not gonna downgrade this place because of this experience I had on Friday, but here goes. So my friends and I, a rather large group, were sitting in the back. There was a private party upstairs in the \"loft\" which contributed to quite a bit of foot traffic in the back. It was REALLY PACKED. No room to walk to the exit packed. Of course, it's a Friday Night after all. Anyways, my friends and I were enjoying our drinks and company, when this random guy comes up to our table. One of my friend's girlfriend was saving his chair by putting her leg on the chair. So back to the random guy who comes up and gets into an argument with her over the chair. He wasn't even part of the party, I don't think anyone knew him there, nor was he welcome. I was just observing, mainly because I was too tired to care. So he got into it with another person in party, and he just kept at it, arguing that he had a right to that chair, which seemed pretty ridiculous especially when the second we surrendered the chair, he decided to leave anyways.", "author": "Michael C."}

Great beer selection, the regulars were very pleasant, and Game 7 NBA finals were on the TV yet everyone seemed really laid back and cool. Plus, there are dogs that just hang out at this place.  I love it!", "author": "Jonathan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-07", "description": "Hobson's Choice is one of those bars that is probably only average for night life but excellent for weekend daytime drinking and that is what I am basing my rating on.  This is the time when it could also be called \"the watcher's bar\" because literally that is one of the best facets.  If you're lucky the best seats are probably right in front where you can sip drinks and people watch as tourists and shoppers mix with the haight locals.  If you're not doing this then its great to watch an undermanned team of friends try to take down one or more of the huge rum beverages and swear they won't be drunk afterwards.  If none of these sound good then you can always sit at the bar and watch sports on the TV.  In any case most of these events are fun between chats with friends and the couches, while not the most practical, definitely add a bit of panache missing in some bars.  Give it a Saturday afternoon with some people you like and see if it changes your mind.", "author": "Steven R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-30", "description": "Ok, I'm just gonna declare this my favorite bar in the city (even though I've only been living here for a month)...  I love how everyone gets the house punch, even the big buff dudes, without feeling girly... you get that Hawaiian punch anywhere else and people might start making fun of you, but not at Hobson's.  Cool bartenders, cooler drinks, and no d-bags when I was there... just a bunch of cool folks on a Friday night having drinks and watching the Giants game...  The only negative is the lack of parking, but that's to be expected.", "author": "Christine H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-08-26", "description": "I discovered this haight bar only but a week ago through the very person that invited me to Yelp. Hobson's Choice blends coffee house conversation with bar stool banter with its medley of seating options and space specific moods  from your typical bar tables in dim light to plush, velvet love seats, arm chairs and sofas under a warm, almost red glow. A great place to meet up with friends to begin an eventful evening and perhaps end up at again to wind back down.", "author": "Sequoia N."}
