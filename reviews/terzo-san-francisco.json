Service took a while, but no worries--we'd booked an early slot after work (6:00), so that was fine. They talked us into dessert (twist my arm, right?) and coffee. No big deal so far. \n\nImmediately after we'd finished dessert, one of my friends got up to use the restroom while we sorted out the check. While he was gone, a server came to our table in a huff and asked us to hurry up and leave--they now had a line at the front door and wanted our table right away! It was very strange, to say the least. We were clearly on our way out the door anyhow (and seriously we'd had the check for five minutes, tops).

Something so many others need to strive for!\n\nThis is a neighborhood gem in a gem of a neighborhood! With a laid back cozy vibe, solid food at reasonable prices, and a nice clientele, this place has it all... With the exception of parking.  On previous visits, I recall seeing valet parking, but haven't seen it the last couple of times.  We were there this evening at 9pm, so perhaps they called it a night, but it can be difficult to snag parking in Cow Hollow, particularly on a Friday and Saturday evening.  \n\nStellar food here.  There are a core group of staples on the menu, and some specials are usually rotated in.  \n\nAfter dozens of visits here, my all-time favorites are: the onion rings, their Hummus with Homemade pita bread, the Chicken Spiedini, and the Roasted Steelhead.  These items are part of their \"permanent collection\".\n\nThe onion rings are reason enough to come here, in my book!  The batter stays crispy, and they always come out piping hot, directly out of the fryer. The good news is that you can get just a half order, which gives you a good sampling.  For me, the challenge is if I order a full order, I'll easily eat the entire full order.  Truly, the half order is plenty for me, and satiates my hankering for their onion rings! \n\nAlso really love their hummus.  Ok, the hummus itself is very tasty, but what I really really love is their House-Made Pita bread. It is soooo good! Trust me and you'll thank me ten times over.  This is a great carb splurge.  This is another item that makes coming here worth the entire visit!\n\nYou'll never go wrong with going for the Free Range Chicken Spiedini.  Very filling skewers of large chunks of white meat chicken. \n\nThe Roasted Steelhead is always nicely prepared.  Always moist with a crisp skin, although I'm not a huge fan of the mix of faro, zucchini and asparagus base it comes with, as it is somewhat liquidy.  \n\nThere's something for everyone on the menu here.  Chicken, hanger steak, a fish, a pasta, and some vegetarian salads...And there all good!\n\nMy one and only complaint this evening was that the iced tea was overly diluted by ice.  I had 3 refills, and each pour was with iced tea that barely even looked like iced tea because it was so light in color.  As a result, it was fairly tasteless.  They could easily fix this by using significantly less ice in the main serving vessel, or in whatever the iced tea is sitting in prior to being served.\n\nService is normally pleasant and helpful, without being intrusive.  \n\nThe dishes are ample enough to share, so we normally get a few appetizers and a main entree to share.  Everything, with the exception of the onion rings, are prepared fairly healthy, in the sense that there aren't items with globs of gravy, or fatty meats. \n\nIt's quality food here, as opposed to quantity of food, though the portions are sufficient.  I'd choose quality over quantity on any given day, and I'd happily dine at Terzo on any given evening!  That much I'm sure of!!", "author": "Lori N."}

Not so dark that you needed to bust out flashlights, which is a plus.  Service-wise, people were pretty quick, filling up water glasses when appropriate and food came out at a good pace- I think the two of us finished in 1.5 hr?\n\nFood: most of the dishes are shareable, and we ended up sharing everything.  They generally say 2-3 smaller plates and then an entree, depending on how hungry you are.  \n\n-- Hummus (with House-Made Pita & Za'atar)($8.50) - Simple, but great.  Still a bit of bite from the ground up chickpeas, which I like.  Would have been great if the pita was a bit on the crispier side so that it wouldn't get soggy or sag when you put the hummus on it, but the za'atar complemented the hummus well.  \n\n-- Saut\u00e9ed Chanterelle Mushrooms (with Crispy Polenta, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, Thyme, Wine & Ricotta Salata)($15) - polenta cake added a nice crunchy element to the dish and complemented the earthy chanterelles well.  Not sure if it needed the creme fraiche since it made the dish a bit heavier than I would have preferred it, but otherwise a good dish to try if you like your mushrooms.\n\n-- Tomato Braised Pork Meatballs (with Creamy Polenta & Reggiano)($13.50) - hard to go wrong with a braised meatball, especially since you end up with a nice, juicy pork ball.  Polenta and parmesan were nice extras to the meatball- this dish is gonna be a bit on the richer side.\n\n-- Linguine alla Carbonara (with Pancetta, Leeks, Garlic, Cream, Black Pepper & Pecorino)($22 for large plate, $14 for small) - I usually associate carbonara with an overly creamy sauce drenching the pasta, so thankfully this wasn't the case here.  There was enough sauce to coat the pasta without overpowering it, and the pancetta added a great amount of savoriness, along with the garlic and pecorino.  One of those dishes that seem to use fewer ingredients but are all impactful altogether.  We ordered a large plate, and this was quite a large plate.  Unfortunately, not for peeps with lactose intolerance or small stomachs (double whammy to me), but still worth a taste. \n\n-- Braised Chicken alla Cacciatore (with Orzo, Herbs, Tomato, Mushrooms & Fried Rosemary)($21) - chicken was juicy and quite flavorful, having soaked up all of the braising liquids!  Orzo was well cooked and also had soaked up the liquids so it wasn't just a plain cooked orzo.  This dish is a little more difficult to share since you'll have to pick your way through the bones to the meat, but perhaps better if ordered as an individual entree.\n\nAll in all, there could be some tweeks to the food to make it awesome, but quite happy with the vibe and service enough to want to bring friends here for a nice, quieter yet slightly upscale dinner.", "author": "Audrey H."}

I don't fancy $$$ places as the food usually is not up to the mark or price for that matter, but Terzo delivered, and it did that so well.\n\nWe had a booking for 4 at 8pm yesterday and the place was quite packed for a Monday night - not too shabby ;)\n\nPlace had dim lights (which I love) giving the ambience that romantic touch and was overall very neat and clean. Oh and they have gender neutral bathrooms - Super!\n\nFood was spectacular really. Everything was nicely cooked, tasty and good quality. Between the 4 of us we shared small plates of:\n\n- Hummus with house made pita $8.5\n- Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari on a bed of lentils $14\n- Tomato Braised Pork Meatballs $13.5\n- Gnocchi Beef Bolognese on a bed of polenta $15\n- Chicken Spiedini  $14\n- Flourless Chocolate cake $9.5\n- 3 flavor ice cream scoops (vanilla, salted caramel and chocolate)\n\nAllow me to start with the hummus - simply delicious. That pita was oh so good! Calamari lacked taste (but that's calamari though...) but the lentils were such a welcomed addition that I really enjoyed this dish. Meatballs were superb and what a smart combination with the polenta. Gnocchi were soft, reach and paired so well with the bolognese. Chicken spiedini was really nice too with chicken being soft and the green chutney had a nice kick to it :). Last but not least, the queen of the night had to be the flourless choco cake - so rich and yummy! I might just be back for this!\n\nService however wasn't the most pleasant. Nothing in particularly wrong with it, just not very friendly and warm so it definitely didn't add to our beautiful experience which is something I expect from a pricey place like this.\n\nDefinitely recommend for group dinners so that people can share different plates or a nice date night.

Our server was super attentive and gave us a bunch of recommendations when it came to food and wine.  Their wine list touches all over Europe and it wasn't hard to find something we wanted.  \n\nFood, on the other hand, was tough to decide on because I wanted to order everything!  We went a different route and decided to order 5 small plates to share.\n\nHummus with house made pita:  The pita was definitely the winner on the plate.  Super soft, fresh, great chew, texture, fantastic.\n\nRoasted beets:  What can I say...I love beets.  And this was also a winner and seasoned well.\n\nGrilled monterey bay calamari:  Served with lentils.  Tender, cooked well, gone in a flash.\n\nTomato braised pork meatballs with polenta:  Probably my least favorite dish although not terrible.  I thought the polenta was underwhelming but the meatballs had good flavor.\n\nFree range chicken spiedini:  Definitely my favorite dish of the night!  I'd come back just for this.  The chicken was on a stick with bread, cilantro, chiles, and onion.  Ugh...so good!!!  A must order if you visit terzo.\n\nFor dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake with a cup of coffee.

The ambiance was nice and cozy but the food and customer service was so so.  \n\nNone of the dishes seemed to nail it.  The calamari appetizer was more like lentil soup with only 4 small pieces of calamari.  The calamari itself was pretty tasty but the lentils ruined it for me and so did the small amount of calamari. I thought this would be more like a calamari dish not lentil soup!\n\nThe only reason why I ordered the calamari was to replace the gnocchi appetizer which wasn't great either.  It was way under cooked and too soft. I've had way better gnocchi dishes at other restaurants.  \n\nFor the main meal I asked for the skirt steak to be medium rare and it came out rare. Although it did have a nice buttery flavor to it but I was mainly annoyed that it came out way undercooked.  \n\nThe chicken dish was decent.  Not great flavoring but not bad and the chicken was tender. I actually thought the rice served with it tasted better than the chicken. The rice had a nice combination of raisins, pistachios and I believe mint.  \n\nThe only items that I thought were really great were the red wine and ice cream trio for dessert, which neither one had to do with the food! \n\nThe service was also ok.  The hostess weren't that friendly as we entered the restaurant and it took awhile for our waitress to greet us.  And none of the staff greeted us goodbye or said thank you as we left either. \n\nOverall I'd say, there are plenty of other great restaurants in San Francisco that have better food and service and appreciates your business.  I'd try other places first and keep this place as a back up option.", "author": "April F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "Came here with a friend for SF Restaurant Week, which was a great deal. Unlike other Restaurant Week menu offerings which are limited to a handful of options, their $40 dinner lets you pick a small plate, a large plate and a dessert from their daily menu.\n\nFOOD: AMAZING. Everything on the menu sounded good, everything we ordered was delicious and all the other dishes we saw other people having looked amazing as well! I wish I came with more people so I could have tried more dishes. All the meat and seafood were perfectly cooked and the dishes were all full of flavor. On the oily side but not at all heavy. Portion sizes are on the smaller side (a healthy portion size), which was disappointing because everything was so good I wanted more!\n\nPRICE: On the pricey side, especially given the portion sizes, so I wouldn't frequent here. But the food quality definitely matches the price.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly staff and food came out reasonably quick.\n\nATMOSPHERE: I love the general vibe here. There's a bar and a communal table in addition to individual tables. Sophisticated, cozy, dimly lit, a little crowded but not too noisy. Great for a date or special occasion. \n\n==============================\n\n*** SMALL PLATES ***\n\n-GRILLED MONTEREY BAY CALAMARI ($13) - 5/5\n[with Umbrian Lentils, Wild Arugula, Piment\u00f3n & A\u00efoli]\nI've never had calamari with such amazing texture! Incredibly soft and tender. None of that chewiness you normally get with squid. Great flavors in this dish from the aioli. I'm not a fan of lentils in general so that part was just okay.\n\n-BRAISED NIMAN RANCH LAMB SHOULDER ($15) - 5/5\n[with Roasted Romanesco & Salsa Verde]\nMy friend and I cut the lamb in half to share, and we could immediately tell that it was cooked perfectly from how easily it cut. SUPER TENDER. A little fatty and oily,  but not heavy. The salsa went really well with the lamb.\n\n\n*** LARGE PLATES ***\n\n-ROASTED STEELHEAD SALMON ($28) - 5/5\n[with Green Basmati Rice, Green Beans, Spigariello & Tzatziki]\nI LOVE salmon and there's nothing that makes me happier than salmon that melts in your mouth. Soo soft and flaky that I didn't want to share! I skipped most of the skin because it was pretty fatty, but it had a nice texture to it. I'm usually indifferent towards rice, but the basmati rice in this dish was really flavorful (probably from the oil..). The green beans added a nice crunch and texture to the dish as well. I didn't feel the need to have the tzatziki with the salmon because it was already flavorful on its own.\n\n-GRILLED NIMAN RANCH SKIRT STEAK ($29) - 4/5\n[with Potato-Leek Gratin, Roasted Broccoli & Olio Nuovo]\nWe asked for our steak medium rare. Normally, restaurants err towards the medium side of medium rare, but to my surprise, they cooked it towards the rare side of medium rare, which is exactly how I like my steak. The meat looked like it would be incredibly tender, but I was a little disappointed to find it a little stringy with a slight chew. Full of flavor, but I would have preferred less salt.\n\n\n*** DESSERT ***\n\n-LEMON YOGURT SORBETTO ($8) - 3/5\nI picked the sorbetto because I wanted a lighter, more refreshing dessert, and everything else looked heavy or rich. I really enjoyed the first few bites - light with some tartness -  but then I started finding it too sweet.\n\n-ORGANIC ICE CREAM ($8) - 3.5/5\n[Mint Confetti, Salted Caramel, Milk Coffee]\nThere's also vanilla and chocolate ice cream, but you can only pick 3 flavors, so we went for the more \"interesting\" ones. I thought the ice cream might be too sweet or rich, but theirs was nice and light. My favorite of the trio was the mint confetti, which was refreshing and had small nibbles (\"confetti\") of chocolate in it rather than chunks. The milk coffee was pretty good too, but I thought the salted caramel was too sweet.", "author": "Jessie L."}

A nice dinner after a day of holiday shopping in Union Square.  \n\nI had a previously horrendous experience at a Tapas restaurant in the bay area so I was reluctant to try another one in area (after having recently gone to Spain and had spectacular tapas).  All concerns were brushed aside once the first order of food arrived at the table.\n\nThe grilled calimari was tender and had a nice flavorfull char.\n\nNext up was the mozzarella di bufala - fresh cheese, toasted bread, salad with the right amount of acidity to balance the dish. \n\nGnocchi - this was recommended by our server, but it was the least liked dish.  Bland and starchy gnocchi was not what I expected.  The only thing going for the dish was the truffle shavings. \n\nSteamed clams was gobbled up by the table quickly.  I took that as a sign that everyone agreed it was good.  \n\nWe also ordered two larger entrees:\n\nThe Niman Skirt Steak: tender, flavorful, and cooked to heavenly perfection of medium rare on the rare side.  It doesn't get better than that. \n\nFinally, we had the house made fettuccine dish - wow, it was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-10", "description": "The food here was INCREDIBLE (5 star caliber) and I don't know how I haven't heard of it before... The 3 star rating comes from the very mediocre/bordering on bad service that we received throughout our 2.5 HOUR long dinner. I came in with the fam (part of 4) on a Sunday night and were seated for our reservation right away. The restaurant was pretty empty at this point and through the course of the night we watched it fill up, and empty our entirely.  We seemed to have like 3 different servers (bartender, waitress, hostess?) which caused for loooong wait times between every aspect of the meal. I don't know if they're understaffed at the moment since other reviews are very different. We waited around 15 minutes to be offered water, 10 more to order a drink, couldn't find a server to order additional food twice (had to ask the bus boy to get us more pitas), consistently had empty water glasses, and waited another 15 minutes after putting our card down to pay to have the server/hostess/bartender take the check and say \"oh no one has gotten this for you yet?\".  Not that I don't like long, drawn out dinners, but this was punctuated with empty glasses and plates so it was not by design.   \n\nOnto the food-which was awesome!! We ordered the hummus & pita with spices that came out warm & delicious. My mom wasn't feeling well so we ordered (after a while) additional pita to mop up other sauces.  We also split the meatballs (my sister thinks they may be the best she's had), the grilled calamari (perfectly cooked & with a nice touch of acidity), and the arugula salad with peaches/ cheese that was delicious as well.  I split the steak with chimichurri and smashed potatoes that was fantastic in taste but very buttery/oily at the bottom.  I also had a taste of their almond cake with strawberries that was both rich (from the almond) and light in texture.  \n\nI may return for the food-but if I do I would prepare to spend the evening dining here/not come starving because the service is SLOOWWWWW.", "author": "Raina D."}

This place has a lot of good things going for it...decent location, nice atmosphere, solid food... So why only three stars?  Well the service was terrible.  She was rude, condescending, impatient, etc.  Perhaps because it was a table of 8 \"youngish\" people who didn't look like we would tip well?  Not sure. \n\nMy other huge problem with this place was the price point.  I get it, restaurants love to do tapas because they make more money on each dish, but come on... While ordering someone asked how many meatballs were in the $12.50 meatball dish.  She said they were about the size of golf balls and it comes with 2 meatballs.  $6.25/tiny little meatball.  Are you kidding me?  I can buy a couple pounds of meatballs for that price.   The thing is, I am not a super cheapskate fast-food eating type of person.  I eat at a lot of good (and expensive) restaurants.  However for me there needs to be something special to justify spending a ton of money on food.  Terzo just did not have this something special for me.  \n\nThe other food we tried was good, including the hummus, but nothing was life changing or worth the price.  If money is no object to you and you look like a good tipper than check our Terzo for some above average tasting food.  If you are looking for upscale Mediterranean I recommend Kokkari Estiatorio.  If you are looking for something that is a better value check out Troya or La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.", "author": "Paul W."}

My boyfriend and I came during Restaurant Week and were blown away by the dishes. The food was right up my alley and I have absolutely nothing to complain about.\n\nWe started with the chicken spiedini, hummus and pita, and grilled calamari. The chicken spiedini came with two skewers of perfectly grilled chicken, onions, and chunks of doughy bread drizzled with an amazing cilantro sauce. The portion was bigger than I expected and it was like no chicken skewer I've ever had before. The grilled calamari was definitely another highlight, maintaining its tender texture without being rubbery. The seafood sat on a bed of beans with a light sauce that let the calamari shine. To round out the small plates, we ordered an extra hummus and pita that is definitely a must-try. Their pita is house made and baked to order, with a fragrant blend of herbs rubbed on top that really makes it unique and delicious.\n\nFor our large plates, we ordered the grilled pork loin as well as the salmon. Both proteins were cooked perfectly, with sides that complemented them well. The salmon had the best crispy skin I've had on a piece of fish in a long time, breaking way to the flaky inside. It was served on a bed of green basmati rice that brought a slight Asian feel to the dish. The grilled pork loin came with braised cabbage and spaetzle, a heartier dish that reminded me of German cuisine. \n\nTo finish off the amazing meal, we had the flourless chocolate cake and the apple crumble. The size of our previous dishes were just right, leaving us with room to enjoy their incredible desserts. The chocolate cake was rich without being too sweet, and the house made whipped cream even had me spooning up dollops when I'd usually be scraping it off. The apple crumble was piping hot out of the oven, with a light crumble and apples tossed in brown sugar and cinnamon. It was a simple but perfect ending to a more complex meal.

The chicken skewers were good.  \n\nWe were very excited to try the BBQed peach bruschetta, but the bread it came on was way too thick and tasted like a (higher quality) wonder bread.  The bread and cheese, which was like cream cheese, overpowered the peaches and balsamic.  There was no BBQ charring flavor at all.  Though I am inspired to make a simpler and more traditional bruschetta with grilled peaches at home so it wasn't a total loss.\n\nThe patatas bravas were bad.  Thick chunks of potato deep fried with sauces that didn't do anything for us.  Ketchup would have been better.  And if you're thinking home fries... Don't.  These were thicker.  It just tasted like a mouthful of bland potato.\n\nI'm not sure where they get their bread from, but it also showed up in the chicken skewer, where it worked a lot better.  Still, it seems like this bread is a point of pride for Terzo and frankly it's below average for a restaurant of this caliber.

The manager/server/whomever he was wouldn't let us inside.  I mean, we would've just sat and drank wine and waited until the kitchen was ready.  So I said \"you want us to wait 10 minutes?\" in which he snapped back \"13 minutes!\"  I rolled my eyes and we left.  We were turned off by the experience and walked around the block.  We only came back because my boss was REALLY wanting some red wine.\n\nOnce inside, the hostess said we can eat and drink, but we must leave by 7:15.  At this point, I'm completely over the people and am hoping the food will at least save them and this review.\n\nFor the wine, I had the Banshee Pinot Noir.  It was fine.  My boss...I think she ordered the Zin-Phomaniac Zinfandel Old Vines.  If that's the one, then it was really good and definitely recommend it.\n\nFor food, we ordered 4 appetizers and 1 dessert.  We ordered: Wild Nettles-Ricotta Ravioli, Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari, Tomato Braised Pork Meatballs, and Grilled Halloumi Cheese.  The funny thing here is that I thought the Grilled Halloumi Cheese was going to be gross, but it turned out to be my favorite!  It was perfectly seasoned and I totally recommend it.  As for the other dishes...pffft!  (rolls eyes)  They weren't bad per se, but they weren't great = None of them had any flavor whatsoever!  For dessert, we had the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Cocoa Nib Toffee Whipped Cream.  That was a good time and I'd recommend that as well.  The presentation of the food was nice and pretty.  Our server was nice and attentive and recommended the wine.\n\nI guess since the restaurant is located in Cow Hollow/Pacific Heights area with all this old money around here, all the old people love the food.  It seems old people are like kids in that they like bland food.  The place, the staff attitudes, the food, the prices, it's all very pretentious.  They think they're rockstars or royalty when really it's all very basic and underwhelming.  Unless my boss wants to go back and drink AND pick up the bill, i won't return or recommend the the place.", "author": "Shaun W."}

We were not starving and my parents were still jetlagged so we decided to keep it a small meal. The inside of the restaurant is very warm and inviting with a bar and a view into the kitchen. The dining area is spaced out nicely leaving enough room between tables. They also have a back room which can be rented out it appears to groups for small events. The servers were extremely friendly here and very attentive. We perused the vino list and were able to get a solid recommendation based on what we were searching for and there were plenty of reasonably priced vinos on the list. I noticed that they also had an interesting beer list. Not extensive but definitely some surprises on the list that I have not seen in too many restaurants. \n\nAfter looking through the menu, we decided to focus on the small plates and ordered an assortment of them. Ordered the hummus, steamed mussels, black truffle risotto, tomato braised pork meatballs, and the arugula salad. They provided bread (which you have to ask for apparently?) which was good and apparently homemade so definitely ask for it. The hummus was a simple & classic dish and the pita was quite good. The mussels were actually really good also with the sauce being unique. Definitely ask for more toast points because you will definitely want to dip it in the sauce. The mussels were well cooked and delicious. The black truffle risotto was okay but a bit bland for me so not a dish that I would probably order again. The arugula salad was a nice simple dish and the dressing was well made which was a nice palette cleanser. The meatballs with polenta were awesome with the polenta being a perfect complement to the meatballs which are straight up authentic. It comes out with two but feel free to add one more meatball for a slight charge! \n\nAll in all, a solid restaurant for tapas.

Now although the menu is not huge, there are a lot of items on there that sound equally as good as the other, but there is where Catherine really came to the rescue. \n\nWe were debating between a few items, but she assured us, that we would not regret ordering the meatballs. Boy was she right! The meatballs are a must have when ordering at Terzo. There was the perfect amount of meatball to polenta.\n\nWe also ordered the Chicken Speiendini, recommended by our fabulous waitress herself, and again she was on point with the recommendations. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the sauce they used, well that was to die for. The little bit of heaven that topped it all off was the small pieces of bread that were placed on the skewer in-between the onion and the marinated chicken. Cut those us, mix it together and well let me just tell you, you will not be disappointed. \n\nAt this point we were beyond full, but because it was my birthday, we decided to go for some dessert. The only problem was, that we couldn't decide between the apple cobbler, and the chocolate cake. I think you already know where I'm going with this, but... we asked Catherine yet again for her recommendation and she was steered us in the direction of the flourless chocolate cake.  That cake was the best chocolate cake that I have ever had. It was super rich, and creamy, with a side of fresh whipped cream with some kind of chocolate flakes in it... absolutely heavenly.\n\nTerzo, you have completely outdone yourself, and have gained two new frequent customers. I will definitely be visiting again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to a friend. So if you are looking for a great place to eat, you would be crazy to pass this place up. Oh and if you do find decide to try it out, ask to be seated in Catherine's section, because she is a rock star!", "author": "Kim J."}

First off, even though the place was about half full  the noise level was still at a comfortable range.  I hate having to shout at my dining companion because places are so loud.  Service was attentive but somewhat casual.  Food was DELICIOUS.  We had the grilled asparagus and ravioli to start, both yummy.  Then we split (2 people) the braised pork shoulder for dinner.  It was a good as it gets.  Served with mashed potatoes and gravy, it was comfort food in the best sense of the term.  Finished it off with the creamy, dark chocolate flourless cake.  I would absolutely go again when I am in the city.", "author": "E M."}

A great place to grab a drink as well.  Did think the club music didn't quite match the decor as my friend noted.\n\nTerzo (third restaurant in their business group as well as the third place to stop by after work and home) was busy on a Saturday night and it's easy to see why.  They accept credit cards, including American Express.", "author": "Randy F."}

The food is divine and the ambiance very romantic. The menu isn't extensive - double the amount of small plates options to entrees - so expect to eat (or share!) lots of smaller dishes! \n\nWe had the meatballs, hummus, and ravioli and couldn't believe how flavorful and delicious each one was! We also split the Linguini, which was very difficult to share.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-24", "description": "Terzo was an overall quality experience. They have a great menu, including a large mix of small plates as well as bigger-sized entrees. It's a very intimate setting, great for a date or a small group catch-up. While the service was generally attentive and friendly, she wasn't terribly warm to over-chatty, which was appreciated. We went with another couple as well and everyone was eating vegetarian - at first glance, the menu didn't look to have too many vegetarian options, but between all of the small plates, there was more than enough to make us all comfortably full! They seem to rotate the menu seasonally and even monthly based on what's freshest. Everyone else at the table split a bottle of dry Riesling to complement the vegetables and they all seemed to like the flavor.\n \nFood -\n \nBeets and pickled onions served atop a creamy cheese sauce - The beets were roasted nicely so they didn't have too much of a \"beet-y\" flavor. When you got a whole forkful of everything together, the cool cheese paired well with the hearty flavor of the beet and the pickled onion.\n \nHummus and za'atar bread - The za'atar had a great spice/pesto-esque blend on it. The hummus was your regular, run-of-the-mill hummus, but was a nice creamy addition to the top of the za'atar.\n \nArugala salad - Very basic salad. Arugala mixed with nut and apple. Simple but a good combination of food and not overdressed.\n \nRoasted vegetables (brussel sprouts, potato, carrot) - These had a delicious sweet glaze on them. They were tossed in that and an olive oil and truly seasoned to perfection!\n \nSmall toasts with burrata and shredded brussel sprouts - This was surprisingly good! A generous serving of burrata and warm/soft brussel sprouts. Upon first glance, the brussel sprouts looked like shriveled lettuce, but it was a great light texture and as it was saut\u00e9ed, it really melted in your mouth. The combo of all three ingredients was relatively plain but packed a flavorful punch.\n \nGnocchi - This had a sharp white cheddar taste. Again, it really melted in your mouth. It was tossed with a bitter green, which broke up the sharpness. It was perfectly shaped homemade little puffs.\n \nMushroom and crispy polenta - The polenta had a nice pan fry to it and was topped with a variety of mushrooms. The mushrooms had been saut\u00e9ed in what seemed to be a mix of olive oil (or butter) with a touch of cream. We ordered a second one of this - while it was light and airy it still had a bit of heartiness to it with the way the polenta was cooked.\n \nSpicy pasta with spinach and pepper - The waitress said the chef had offered to cook us a full-sized version of vegetarian pasta if we were interested. This was cooked in an olive oil and all of the vegetables were saut\u00e9ed. There was a nice heat to it and while the pasta was simple, it was cooked to a great texture between al dente and being too soft.\n \nBread pudding - This was great - almost like a cinnamon bun wrapped into bread pudding - was such a treat! Had cherries cooked throughout for an added touch of sweet/tartness. It was topped with what they called whipped cream, but it almost had the consistency/taste of a marshmallow fluff on top, which spread out perfectly over the bread pudding. It was really terrific!\n \nTrio of ice creams - Another very simple thing done very well. Small scoops of ice cream (mint chocolate chip, chocolate and salted caramel) that again seemed to be made in-house. You could really taste the flavor in each (mint chocolate chip tasted like a girl scout thin mint), and we enjoyed these too.", "author": "Jackie W."}

The restaurant in general has a nice feel to it, clean lines, open spaces. Seemed like a local spot - it seemed like the people around us or walking in knew the wait staff and bartenders. We were a little confused when we first came in because it was a very early dinner with lots of open tables, and the hostess decided to seat us at the two-person table in the walkway, near the bathrooms. We had to ask her to please move us since there were so many other open tables and she seemed put off by the request. We ordered two appetizers and the highly-recommended Greek-style chicken. We were disappointed with the appetizers but WOW WOW WOW on the chicken - they really nailed it! We were also excited about the wine list and had fun trying some new wines.

Everything on the menu sounded so good it was difficult to decide what to order.  Thankfully the server provided some helpful recommendations.  We ordered: \n\n- Roasted Beets with Labneh, Dill, Pomegranate Molasses & Pickled Onion; \n- Mozzarella di Bufala with Mixed Herb Pesto, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche & Toasted Focaccia;\n-Tomato Braised Pork Meatballs with Creamy Polenta & Reggiano; \n- Chicken Cacciatore special \n\nThe portions were generous and this was more than enough food for two people.  Everything was delicious - in particular I enjoyed the buffalo mozzarella.  It was super creamy and I loved that it came with toast and ample amounts of pesto.  The meatballs were also very good; I would definitely order these again.  I also enjoyed the chicken dish, however it was quite salty (and I say this as a person who loves salt).  \n\nWe stayed past their closing time yet they were extremely nice and did not rush us out.  The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere - not too loud or bright and the tables are spaced a good distance from each other.

I've walked by here a here a few times and always wanted to try it. Orin made a reservation and we were promptly seated when we arrived. Our waitress was very, VERY, friendly. She was uber cheerful and bared so much teeth every time she smiled, I had to suppress the urge to reach into my purse and rattle my Prozac bottle for affirmation.\n\nTerzo offers a selection of around 10 small plates and 5 large plates. After consulting our waitress, we decided to order 3 small plates and one big one. Yes, these little piggies were hungry! We ordered the baked zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese, roasted squash topped with cheese, the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with cheese and the braised pork shoulder entree. \n\nOur food came in rapid succession. This was the first time that I've tried zucchini flowers and I loved it! The preparation was simple and light to let the freshness and quality of the ingredients to shine through. The stuffed flowers were topped with a little parsley and lemon to cut the creaminess of the ricotta. When I read roasted squash on the menu, I was expecting butternut squash, but it was actually zucchinis that arrived on the plate. The suckers were so tender, they were bursting! The cheese was a great addition, adding nuttiness and saltiness. The bacon on the dates were crispy and the cheese melted with the sweetness of the fruit. All three were winners.\n\nThe pork shoulder was my favorite of the night. The meat was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. As with the other dishes, the chef showed restraint with the seasoning to let the ingredients speak for themselves. The mashed potatoes was silky and the wilted chard still had a bite to it.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed at the end of the meal so decided to skip dessert. \n\nTerzo has wonderful atmosphere and definitely great for date night.

Ambiance - classic wine bar/restaurant, perfect lighting, wine bottles lining the windows, open bar area.\n\n2. Service - our waiter Phil was so great. Typical girls night out entailed more talking than menu browsing but Phil was more than patient with us. He also did a great job of providing recommendations and timing our meal. \n\n3. Drum roll please for the food! \n\nHummus (4 stars) - nothing not to love about this dish! Simple and classic. \n\nBeets (5 stars) - beautifully presented and perfectly cooked. It came with a caramelized onion topping which was just enough flavor to not detract from the beets but turn the dish into something special.\n\nBrussels (4 stars) - delicious and cooked well but personal preference on these guys is to be a little darker. Still a great dish though with melted romano cheese on the top.\n\nMushrooms with Polenta (5 stars) - Terzo nailed it with this one. Arguably the \"richest\" dish of the night but but this dish was light and downright fun to eat.\n\nCalamari - (5 stars) rivaled the above said mushrooms as my favorite of the night. Grilled fish on top of a bed of white beans.

Wine selection by the glass is good and the place is just around the corner from my apartment. \n\nWhy don't I come here for dinner every week then? Not sure. Think it's the general aura of the place. Staff aren't all that friendly--not unfriendly per say--but generally they seem like they're just waiting for their shifts to end.  Instead of speaking to the diners at the bar, the bartenders will just chat with other servers on the side. I've dined there a few times, and haven't gotten the feel that they care about me coming back. Not a big deal, but it just lacks the charm that other places nearby have, like Gamine, where the owners are always present and welcoming.

This was by far my favorite dish. It came as small pieces of grilled chicken on a skewer with grilled flavorful bread and onions.

This was a relief to me, since I have celiac disease and have had no choice but to eat gluten free for 8 years now. Unfortunately, when it came to the small plates, modifying the dishes for this chef means removing any semblance of flavor. I had expressed concern about whether a couple of the small plates we ordered would still be good after the removal of the gluten components (chef is unwilling to substitute, only willing to remove), and the waiter assured us that these were still good options. The waiter later admitted that none of the waitstaff ever tries the gluten free versions of these dishes. The frittata was a bland and overpriced green omelette, and the saut\u00e9ed chanterelles with creamy polenta (the standard crispy polenta must have some sort of flour in it) sorely lacked salt. They also charged an extra $4 for the half a dozen tiny slices of carrot and celery to eat with the hummus we had ordered since pita is a no-go.

That being said, I think this place is underrated. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was fantastic. The service was so so, but I'm not going to let that bring down the rating this place deserves.\n\nThere were three of us, and we split 5 small plates and a dessert. Here's what we had:\n\n1. Heirloom Tomatoes - fantastic. Fresh ripe tomatoes and perfect sized chunks of mozzarella soaked in a flavorful pesto sauce. $9.5\n\n2. Grilled Kadota Fig Bruschetta with Mascarpone, Honey & Mint. $9.5 - absolutely my favorite dish, absolutely amazing.\n\n3. Tuna Nicoise Salad - perhaps the most beautifully presented and largest of the small plates. Delicious. $15\n\n4. Roasted Beets with Labneh, Dill, Nigella & Pickled Onions $8.5\n\n5. Roasted Local Ling Cod with Potato Pur\u00e9e, Corn, Sungold Tomatoes & Tarragon $13 - tasty, but not my favorite\n\n6. Flourless Chocolate Cake with Espresso Whipped Cream $8 - Good but not great\n\nI'd definitely go back again to experience some of the new things they have on their menu everyday.", "author": "Krista S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-16", "description": "4.5 Stars! I'm surprised this place isn't more popular.  Maybe this is due to the fact that is just barely outside the fringe of Union street madness and a little further away from Chestnut madness.  I find there are only a handful of good dinner restaurants in the Marina and most have a very long wait.\n\nI'm even more surprised to find that Terzo has mixed reviews - I came here once a couple months ago and had an excellent meal.  We ordered:\n- the hummus: good, not great. My boyfriend really enjoyed it, but for a Mediterranean restaurant, I expected better\n- tomato braised meatballs: delicious! served with polenta, which was a divine combination\n- the brussel sprouts: served with honey, rosemary and (I think) goat cheese.  I never thought I would prefer sprouts without pancetta! These were exceptional!\n- braised Moroccan style chicken: Holy Sh*t! I've had a lot of chicken and always been a strong believer that no matter how well you cook chicken, it is still, well...chicken.  SO not the case here.  This chicken was so good I would have ordered it before beef, pork, lamb or duck (and this is saying a lot)!  This is the kind of dish that just makes you feel good.\n\nWe went back a few weeks ago and had another excellent meal. We ordered:\n- a sausage dish: a chef special.  I can't for the life of me remember what it was paired with but it was simple and excellent\n- 1/2 portion hand cut fettucine: with fava been pure and creme fraiche. I'm so anti-fava been anything because this usually means bland.  Not the case here, so good we almost ordered another half order!\n- grilled skirt steak: with herb potato gratin, asparagus and chimichurri: the most tender skirt steak I've ever had.  Cooked perfectly, incredible flavor and perfectly paired sides\n\nOnly disappointment was the dessert menu.  I'm so sick of seeing the same damn panna cotta, flourless chocolate cake, apple crisp BS.  Try something original!\n\nThe service was great (2 different servers, both great). Ambiance is trendy & romantic - great date night restaurant.  No trouble getting a table, even on a friday night.  We made reservations both times but didn't need to, which I found so incredibly attractive in the Marina insanity of dining on a friday/saturday night.

Sadly, I've only been 4 times in the past 4 years..there are so many amazing restaurants in SF and I'm not fond of going to the Marina but I always enjoy myself when I go to Terzo.\n\nTerzo's menu is unassuming but although the food and preparations are simple, the food is really flavorful. Small plates with a few large plate offerings and a rotating menu. The rotating menu is a double edged sword. New dishes to try but sometimes your faves aren't available that night.\n\nCase in point, my all time favorite is their tomato and egg bruschetta. It's only been on the menu one out of the four times that I've been to Terzo but it's one of the main reasons that I keep returning.\n\nOther faves:  Meatballs with polenta, chicken speidini.

I shared the bruschetta, asparagus, meatball, beet salad, and hummus with two other people.   Everything we ordered was delicious and it was just the right amount of food.  I liked how the items were brought out one or two at a time so that we didn't have to deal with passing around 5 or six plates at once.  \n\nThe service kinda ruined it for me.  When we walked in the door, we were immediately asked \"Do you have a reservation?\"  This honestly seemed like a joke, since the place was literally empty.  But no - apparently it was completely booked except for a few tables by the window.  This information was given with an attitude.  Excuse us for not making a reservation, and as a matter of fact the window tables seemed just fine.\n\nThe waiter (who was the bartender, too) took his time coming over to us even though he clearly wasn't at all busy.  There were big gaps between ordering our drinks, receiving them, and finally getting the opportunity to order food.  When we gave our order, he didn't write anything down, and sure enough he had to come back and ask us again about what we'd ordered.  We got our food alright but he never came back to check on us or refill our water glasses.  \n\nFast forward to the end of the meal, when we were done eating and had somewhere else to be.  The waiter/bartender was standing behind the bar talking and laughing with two female servers, having a great time.  We tried to signal to him that we needed our check, but no dice.  He was completely engrossed in flirting with these waitresses.  We finally managed to flag down another server, and then the bartender/waiter came rushing over and mock-scolding the helpful one for trying to 'steal' his table.  Apparently he would've made his way over eventually and didn't appreciate anyone trying to speed the process along.  \n\nMorals of the story: if you don't want to sit by the window, make a reservation.

Terzo mostly serves small plates designed for sharing and trying a variety of things. The food is excellent - my favorite dishes (amongst the several that we ordered) were the hummus (fresh and delicious, served with pita), the ricotta stuffed squash blossoms, and the asparagus (I don't eat meat, but everyone seemed to enjoy the meat dishes that we ordered as well).  Terzo has a great selection of wines to accompany your meal (our waitress was helpful in selecting two wines that we enjoyed).\n\nThis is a great, classy place for a date or dinner with friends - in other words, it has that \"nice restaurant feel\" without the accompanying stuffiness that would preclude someone from coming here for after work drinks with friends.  Terzo's staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  I'll definitely be visiting Terzo again soon.", "author": "Rishi N."}

We has a reservation for 6:15 on a Saturday night, and needless the say, the place was not slammed...but it still took our waiter 7 minutes to come great us...and we had to ask for him.  \n\nI was with a friend and her mother--and how to put this tactfully....we didn't exactly look homeless.  Nevertheless, it was a challenge to get him to pay any attention to us.  There was none of the seduction that comes w/ eating out, rather, he just seemed to want to rush us through.\n\nOn to the edibles--we did a bunch of small plates--started w/ the hummus, which in itself was fine, but the housemade pita w/ za'atar was super delicious.  Less delicious was when the waiter asked it we wanted more (of course), w/o telling us that it was an extra fee for 5 more quarters.  But still--skip the hummy, just get the bread--but worth ordering.  We then did the heirloom salad w/ olives and basil pesto--sounds flavorful, right?  False.  The tomatoes looked lovely but lacked flavor, as did the olives and pesto, which is a challenge.  \n\nThe stars of our meal were the roasted beets (pink, on a bed of labneh (okay) and sprinkled w/ fresh dill (yum) as well as the arugula salad w/ ricotta salata and figs.\n\nFor dessert we did the flourless chocolate cake, which was surprisingly light and wonderful.\n\nFor the 3 of us it was $93, w/o tip, including 1 glass of wine and 2 $4.50 hot teas.  I think I wouldn't have been so critical of the food had the waiter tried to make it somewhat of a pleasant experience, but alas, perhaps I'm expecting too much...like courtesy.", "author": "Rachel N."}

There was no problem with that process.\n\n1. Ambience: Open kitchen, modern look, communal table in the middle. I love the wine displays on the wall. I have noticed this on other restaurants. \n\nIt is a great look.\n\nThere is a bar in the front. the tables and chairs were nicely spaced and comfortable. we were greeted by the receptionist and seated immediately at our table.\n\n2. Service: our waiter was very good. I asked him about the wine, particularly whites and he ran off the top of his head 6 or 7 whites and described them in good detail. He knew his stuff. He was funny and engaging but wasn't overbearing with too many is \"everything okay?\", which I liked. \n\n3. Parking: only bad thing. it is in the Marina area which is residential. very hard to find in a weekend during dinner time. We did valet($10). The area is very nice with small boutiques.One can get there early and do a little shopping.\n\n4. Food/drinks: We ordered several appetizers or \"small plates\" as they call it. each one is good for about 2-3 people. \n\nA. roasted beets: great flavor. would never think about eating beets, but this was good! \n\nB. chicken spiedini, very tender. roasted chicken with great herb flavor on skewers. each order came with 2 skewers so we made 2 orders which were combined into one plate. The skewers were large portions. People who don't have large stomachs can probably share one.\n\nC. grilled monterey calamari: not the fried type. was okay. it sat on a bed of beans and greens which were flavored nicely. I wish there was more squid.\n\nD. last appetizer was the pork meatballs and creamy polenta: I loved this appetizer the most. So tender! A bit heavy, so don't eat too much or else you won't have enough room for your entrees.\n\nfor the Entrees: \n\nA. I had the grilled Mahi Mahi freshly caught from Costa Rica. Outstanding freshness, grilled perfectly. it was lightly dressed in a lemon butter sauce which gives the food a sour and salty flavor. It sat on a bed of napa cabbage. I would eat a portion of the cabbage and some of the fish together rather than seprately. wash it down with a good white wine. All of the flavors balance each other out. Delish!!\n\nB. My wife had the skirt steak, med rare. Awesome! can't go wrong with steak as long as it is cooked to your liking. Very tender and generous portion!\n\nC My other table mates had Braised Mary's chicken and the Niman Ranch Braised Pork Shoulder: I didn't taste these but they mentioned all were good. the chicken was a HUGE portion.\n\nD. beverages: good selection of beer and wines. I loved my white wine, it was light and had stone fruit accents. a bit on the sweet side almost like a desert wine. it blended with my entree very well. \n\nDessert: I had the flourless choc cake and espresso cream: was okay. was a bit too heavy for me. I loved my wife's ice cream medley. it had espresso, mint chocolate and  walnut. \n\nPrice: not too bad, spent a bit over $400 for 6 of us, including gratuity.\n\nI wanted to note that all the food is organic and mostly from local farms.\n\nfor a special dinner or a get together with friends/family of business, this place is great. will go back again!!", "author": "Milton C."}

While not particularly inventive, the selections were well-executed and for the most part quite tasty. I was, however, put off by the cool temperature of the Niman Ranch beef. It was served on top of piping hot potatoes and grilled green onions but the meat itself was not hot, let alone room temperature (which is what they claimed the intended preparation was when I asked.) If you want more than a solitary bite of the Serrano ham, better order two plates --- the portion is quite insignificant. \n\nEver felt like the whole \"small plates\" idea is just a way to con you into parting with yet more of your hard-earned cash? Terzo might just corroborate that feeling.\n\nTrue stand-outs were the hummus and the chicken spiedini. If they are on the menu when you dine at Terzo, do not miss these selections.\n\nThough we were both looking forward to dessert, we didn't order any because none of the selections were tempting. \n\nBecause the menu at Terzo changes so frequently, I think enjoyment is a lot about chance. If you arrive on a night when they've got a lot of things on offer that you like, you'll enjoy it. Conversely. . .\n\nSUMMARY:\nHummus with House Made Pita & Za'atar- Four and a half stars\nFree Range Chicken Spiedini with Bread, Chile & Onions- Five stars\nRoasted Niman Ranch Beef with Potatoes- Two and a half stars\nSerrano Ham with Melon- Three stars\n\nService --- Three and a half stars\nAtmosphere --- Three and a half stars\n\nFinal calculation: Nearly four stars, and had it not been for the cold beef, I think I'd have rounded up.", "author": "Miriam W."}

I went to dinner with my roommate last night and the first thing she said when we walked in was \"It looks so chic. Even the music is chic, it sounds like what you hear when the Sex and the City girls walk into a uber chic place in NYC.\" Not going to lie, that was such a turn off for me. I usually believe the chic places have some of the worst food. I couldn't have been more wrong. In fact, I want to go through my whole meal just to tell you how delicious it was:\n\nFirst course: Smoked trout and watermelon radishes - I had never heard of watermelon radishes, let alone tried a regular radish, but I saw it at the next table over and it looked delicious. I am so glad we ordered this. I LOVED all of it, especially the radishes. I'm not sure what the sauce on it was, some vinaigrette or something, but it was just perfect. A nice, light salad that's not really a salad. \n\nSecond course: Braised lamb shoulder with mashed potatoes - This was the BEST part of the meal. I love lamb and have eaten a fair share of it, but this far surpassed every lamb dish I have ever tasted. Thinking about it makes my mouth water. This is a must try.\n\nThird course: Skirt steak - After the lamb this didn't do it for me. It's not that it was bad, on the contrary it was great, it just couldn't compare. On the other hand, I found out that I do like brussel sprouts. I have never tried them because my mom hates them, but they were so well cooked. Additionally, the steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Probably a little more on the rare side, but exactly how I want my medium rare to look.\n\nFinal course: Apple Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Pot du'creme. The apple crisp was delicious and had huge chunks of apple. It was perfectly sweet/cinnamony. I would order that again in a second. I had never had a pot de creme and I don't think I would again, its not for me.\n\nAdditionally, we both had two glasses of wine each. The waitress knew everything about the wines, and perfectly described them. \n\nWith the quality of the food, environment, and service, I will be coming back!

I grew up eating Mediterranean food prepared by family members that lived in Lebanon so I can be very picky when it comes to Mediterranean fare.  My husband and I just moved back to SF from LA and have been looking for our go-to restaurant and believe we have found it.  We decided to try as many small plates as possible so went for the Calamari, Salad, meatballs, Brussel sprouts, beet salad, mozzarella di bufala, hummus, Chicken Spiedini & fried onions, wow didn't realize how much we ate until just now, but anyway... Each dish was as good as the one before.  I especially loved the fried onions which came out last and we were pretty much full but one bite and I was hooked. I was surprised by the consistency of the flavor profile.  Everything had it's own distinct clean taste.  All the dishes worked together.  They have a nice wine list (Chateau Masur a Lebanese wine, not easy to find and a reasonable price) and the atmosphere feels very neighborhoodie which I prefer.

In the interim, I took in the decor (quite nice, muted and ... solid tones) and participated in the shall-we-stay-or-shall-we-go session that had broken out between the crew. Eventually the couple that was hogging seats and keeping a couple of us standing got a table, and we realized that we had pretty much conquered the bar area. So we decided to stay.\n\nMost of you mere mortals place your order by saying something along the lines of \"and I'll have the xyz, and she'll have the abc...\" - well, not us. We took it to the limit when I said \"Yeah, we're going to tell you what we *don't* want - bring us everything else on the menu!\"\n\nI was serious - so we had everything on the Tapas menu with the exception of the Sea Bass (bad reviews on Yelp), the apple/peach Remoulade (sounded like a product of the Gerber company), the Salad (greens. Nuff said) and the Soup (how were we going to split it?)\nOf the Tapas that was memorable, the sausage comes to mind - as do the mussels, the chicken and the beets. The portions were *exceedingly small* - one of the reasons for the three star review - but definitely tasty.\nOn an auxiliary note, we also enjoyed the juvenile humor endemic to consuming the \"spicy salted nuts\", the \"sausage\" and \"the cockburn tawny port\".\n\nThe price for this repast, you ask? About $50 per person - including a bottle and a few glasses of vino. Our bartender was a nice guy, who entertained us with conversation and added to the (considerable) ambiance. Definitely a reasonably priced meal, all things considered.\n\nParking really isn't a problem - they have valet - we easily found spots for two cars on the same block.

We prompted our waitress for her favorite items on the menu and she named 4 small plates and 2 entrees, and that's precisely what we ordered.\n\nThe small plates came in twos with the roasted beets and the buffala came first and they were awesome.  Next was the meatballs and the chanterelle mushrooms over crispy polenta.  As soon as the mushroom dish hit the table we ordered another one on sight!  Our table service was awesome and consistent. Water glasses filled and clean plates provided every couple of minutes it seemed.\n\nThe big plates were as good as the openers.  We shared the skirt steak and pork shoulder and both were unbelievable.\n\nFor dessert we split the flourless chocalate cake and the lemon pot de creme.  Just as with the dinner these were extremely tasty!  The staff also brought a little trio of ice cream with candles to celebrate my birthday.  I had related how poor the service had been at Nick's Cove on my actual birthday and offered my compliments on both the service and the food at Terzo.  \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Terzo!!!", "author": "Joe M."}

If you order 2 small plates or 1 large plate (per person) you can get 50% off bottles of wine under $40. I went with 5 friends and we each got two small plates, shared it all, and had two bottles of wine. \n\nThe food is amazing! I would recommend the chicken spiedini which they are well known for. Also the bruschetta was amazing. Apparently their hummus is really tasty too but we didn't try it. For greens/veggies, try the aspargus and also the arugula salad. The meatballs come with a delicious polenta. Basically, you can't go wrong with any of the small plates.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and helpful in selecting a wine that we all loved. The music was nice, not too loud and nothing boring. The ambiance is also great - you feel like you are at a very nice restaurant but you can just hang out, enjoy a comfy meal, chat quietly with a friend or laugh with a whole table.

In summary, we had a great time.  Terzo had a nice vibe to it:  very warm but still had a modern feel.  The decor and ambiance were nice without being stuffy...and had enough of a modern feel without feeling too loungy or feeling like management was trying too hard.\n\nAnd the food...delicious.  We started with the fried egg bruschetta and the hummus with homemade pita.  The hummus was good and the pita was nice and warm with a slight crisp.  The fried egg bruschetta though was scarfed down in no time at all.  Strange how some egg, bread, greens, ricotta and olive oil could taste so good but that's what it was.\n\nFor our main courses, we had the skirt steak and the pork loin.  Both dishes were excellent.  The skirt steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and combined with the chirrichurri, was very flavorful.  My fiancee thought the pork loin was just slightly overcooked.  I disagreed but in any event, that's the reason for the one star deduction.  Irregardless, the flavor was still delicious and she still enjoyed it.  \n\nTo wrap it up, we had the apple crisp.  Very good.  That's all I really have to say about it.  So yes...Yay! I'm a fan.", "author": "Francis S."}

He came back with Terzo and we were glad he did! We arrived a little bit early for our reservation and found 2 spots at the bar. We decided to order a bottle of wine and an app while we waited. The bottle of wine was fantastic, it was a Pinot Noir from California (I told him we were only ordering CA wines since we were in CA) and we both found the quite very tasty. We then ordered the Meatballs and polenta and it came out with lightening speed and was absolutely delicious!!! The meatballs were sooo tasty as was the  marinara sauce, but the stopper was the polenta. It was so creamy and tasty, we were in heaven. \n\n We were then seated for dinner and we decided to don one more starter so we had the hummus. The bread was amazing, it was piping hot and hand this wonderful seasoning to it. The hummus was good as well with a little bit of olive oil on top.  For our mains, I had the spaghetti and my boyfriend had the pork loin. Mine was absolutely AMAZING! I was expecting a red sauce, but was pleasantly surprised when it was just a noodle with tons of veggies, red pepper flakes and the topping was bread crumbs instead of Parmesan cheese. OMG, was it every tasty!!! If you don't like spicy, I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish (I happen to love spicy), it had very nice heat at the end of each bite. It was simply amazing. My boyfriends Pork Loin was delicious as well and we were both way too stuffed to even think about dessert. \n\n I loved the ambiance of this place as well, we chilled at the bar for about a half hour before seated and we felt like we were in someone's kitchen. There was this little knook with tons of cook books on the shelves it was like being at home! I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the area, it was delicious!!!", "author": "Kori E."}

They sat us at the communal table since there was not an open table for five available.\n\nWe opted to do family style (which in retrospect in my opinion was a bad idea).  The food was tasty, but because we only got a \"taste\" you really couldn't get the full experience.  At these nicer restaurants I think I'd be more satisfied with one dish for $30 rather then one bite of 5 dishes.\n\nAll in all, everyone enjoyed the experience.

We readily took up the restaurant's offer of 1/2 off any bottles of wine under $40 (mon - thurs, i believe), ordering a white and a red for our group.

Portion size was very favorable for a beets salad and the taste was perfect. Next up, meatballs...liked the meatballs but didn't love. I think it needed more tomato sauce but other than that they were good. And on to the entree, I had the Moroccan style chicken and my date had the flank steak. I love loved the chicken and I typically never order chicken because steak or fish entice more; however, it was awesome. Basmati rice, juicy chicken leg, mango (I think), dates\nor some type of prune, nuts, and a great sauce. It won me over.

Nestled in this quiet block in Cow Hollow (saw the Hollow Cow down the block), this seemed like unfamiliar ground for me; heck, I couldn't even remember whether Steiner was east or west of Fillmore Street. Reading some of the promotions and postings, this is obviously a good spot for wine connoisseurs, given the large list and their reasonable pricing specials (half off on selected wines). My cousin used to work in a nearby office, so she was familiar. The menu is not huge, but has a good variety of small plates and about five large plate selections. We strategized the following menu of shared appetizers for a party of eight (2 each except for the cured meats, 1): \n1) Hummus (signature dish) - I'm not big on this, but everyone seemed to enjoy it. - $8.00 \n2) Bruschetta - My personal favorite. How can you hate on crispy toast covered with tomatoes and a sunny-side egg? Love my runny eggs. - $9.00 \n3) Cured Meats - Mixture of three or four different meats. Was afraid to eat beyond my share (eight in our party). - $9.00 \n4) Panzarotto - Their version of calzone, filled with gooey cheese and topped with their tangy tomato sauce. - $9.50 \n5) Meatballs - Two raquetball-sized pork meatballs in a tangy, cheesy tomato sauce on a bed of polenta. My #2 choice of appetizers. - $13.00 \nLarge Plates \nI ordered the Grilled Skirt Steak, done medium rare (perfectly done). It came with baby carrots and braised potatoes, which were melt-in-mouth good. There was some small glob of buttery substance that melted on the steak; it made the dish a little too rich for my taste. - $26.00 \nMy parents and cousin gave me portions of their Braised Chicken, served on a bed of tasty rice - $22.00, and Wild Salmon (from Washington state, as emphasized by our waiter), which came on a bed of garbanzo beans - $27.00. The salmon was okay, but the chicken was probably the star large plate. They basically give you the drumstick and thigh as the waiter aptly warned that it is dark meat. The braising (slow cooked) process kept the meat both tender and moist with the chicken flavor infusing into the rice. The pork chop, ordered by a friend, looked very good, but I didn't try it - $24.00. \nSides \nCrispy Onions - We ordered two servings of this for the eight of us to share, which was more than enough. Think temperature hot, crunchy onions strings in a large crock-sized bowl. Great with the steak. - $3.00 \nDesserts \nNectarine Tart - I ordered this to share with my parents as the above was enough for a more-than-satisfying meal. Small slices of white nectarines in a light sauce top a flaky,buttery crust; the tart is topped with one small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Love our seasonal fruits and vegetables here. - $8.00 \nThe waiter was pretty efficient to start (stating that many if not all ingredients are organic from Napa and Sonoma counties), but, as the meal progressed, there were some \"errors\" to our meal: a) ordered grilled asparagus - was not placed, b) friend ordered pork chop, but originally served spaghetti (which looked delish, BTW) - ten minute wait afterwards. But, since the food was very good, they became afterthoughts. Prior to leaving, they comped an extra order of the nectarine tart to our table, which was a nice gesture. The servers were very efficient in keeping water glasses filled and removing empty plates, often a daunting task with big parties. I was ready to give a 3.5 star for the entire experience (minus 0.5 for the errors), but then I heard my cell phone voice mail. Someone from the restaurant apologized for an error and informed me that they credited my credit charge for about $20.00 to correct this.

I have lived 1/2 a block from this restaurant for nearly a year, and have never been.  What a mistake!  I was missing something great!\n\nThe ambiance was wonderful . . . very warm and cozy, yet spacious enough to have a good amount of tables.  The service was friendly and knowledgeable . . . I love it when a server speaks of a dish about which you can tell they are genuinely passionate. \n\nWe chose a bottle of a French Syrah blend, which was spicy, and much broader than you usually get for a digestible price point.  They were out of the meatballs and the pork (not a big deal, since it was close to closing time) so we had three starters and a main.  I am still thinking about the Ling Cod (which is what led me to come and write this).  We also really enjoyed our calamari (not fried) panzanella, and the fig bruchetta.  For our main, we shard the chicken over basmati rice.  This was the dish that was so clearly loved by our waitress.  She did not steer us wrong.  It was divine. \n\nNot usually a dessert person, we were persuaded, as my friend and I had been speaking about fresh peaches, and there was a fresh peach cobbler.  I do not regret those calories, even as I head to the Coit tower stairs today to burn it off.\n\nAll in all, a treat.

First of all, the tables are way too close and there are no sound-dampening solutions, so it's loud as hell, even though there are not that many people in the restaurant. We had no idea who our waiter was; we waited 20 minutes for someone to come by and take our drink order. We finally had to has the hostess to send someone over for that. My client asked about the 3 champagne options (each $12+ per glass) they had available and the waiter had no clue. That's tacky. The food was certainly not worth the money. It was dull. Tasted like something from a food truck. Would never go back.

And many tapas places, with the recommended 2 - 3 plate/customer at $10-$15/plate, have done well by that model. I for one have gone home hungry too many times to have been taken again. However, Terzo breaks the mold and represents how it can work. \r\n\r\nThe formula starts with a chef like Mark Gordon who has obviously made a deal with the devil because his pan-Mediterranean cuisine is unbelievably good. Another nice addition is the impeccable choice of local, seasonal ingredients and a menu that changes often. \r\n\r\nWe had a small late dinner starting with the Steamed Mussels with oloroso sherry, bay leaf and grilled toasts. The broth from this will have you asking for a straw or more bread.  \r\nSide by side we had the perfectly Roasted Beets with yogurt, garlic and dill.

We were amazed that they were nearly booked on a Tuesday night.

It actually was helpful, because we would see dishes that we thought looked good, then we'd ask the server what it was and got their opinion about it. \r\n\r\nThe menu only consists of 16 small plates, and our server recommended that we order at least 6 to share between the 3 of us.

I usually like to select two meat/fish dishes, as well as a couple of vegetable sides and one of the salads.

Between the three of us, we got 7 plates, and it was really just the perfect amount of food.  We ordered: pacetta wrapped figs, roasted beets, heirloom tomato bruschetta, roasted chanterelle mushrooms, chicken spiedini, sausage, and the roasted beef.  Everything was really really good, with the sausage, figs and bruschetta being the standouts.\n\nThe wine list is great because it is loaded with non-Californian wines, and most of them are moderately prices (under $60).\n\nThe wait staff did a great job.  They were great about bringing the food out in groups of 2-3, so at no point were we sitting there with an empty table, but we also didn't have to deal with 7 plates on the table all at once.\n\nAll around, very satisfying meal -- I'll definitely be coming back!", "author": "Maneesh B."}

(Plus, Ray was buying, so at the very least I knew I'd get some decent wine out of it). Turns out it's this trendy Mediterranean joint where the small plates are delicious and plentiful, the wine flows like beer, and beautiful women instinctively flock like the Cougars to the Triangle.\n\nI'm an opportunistic wino, so for me the decor is comforting (you feel like you're in a wine cellar). And the food is fantastic, albeit slightly confusing at times (why is there a fried egg on my bruschetta? I have no idea, but it is tasty!). I recommend the aforementioned bruschetta-o-befuddlement, and their hummus which is splendid and served with home-made pita bread. \n\nFellas, its a great place to take a strumpet. And ladies, your date will appreciate the fact that instead of hitting on you, the waiter will treat you like his sister (one who he beats up.

I've been going there for over four years (~100 great meals).  It's a beautiful restaurant with great service and exceptional food.  But, I'm finished with the place.  For some reason Terzo believes that all their patrons enjoy their raucous, annoying, disco-style music.  I don't!  I became\" fed up\" in September when I asked them four times to please \"turn it down.\"  It didn't happen.\n\nAfter a three month boycott, I sheepishly returned this month, believing that I had overreacted.  I hadn't!  The same obnoxious noise ruined my meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-03", "description": "A little Stuffy.\n\nI have been to Terzo numerous times, but after my second to last experience, I felt the need to, and finally got around to, writing a review. Possibly a scathing one, but not as to the food, only as to the service.\n\nMost of my earlier experiences were good to quite good! The small shared portions are usually tasty, BUT, BE WARNED, the waiter/waitress will try to get you to over order. These dishes are more filling then they let on. Thus, I don't recommend you taking their recommendation on the size of your order. Otherwise, the wine and beer selection is commendable.\n\nI went there with a large group for my cousin's birthday party and had a great experience, although my beloved, but very hard to please uncle (as he has several fancy restaurants of his own), was far from impressed.  When he was asked if he enjoyed the food and/or wine, the waiter got nothing but a smirk - as if to say, hmmm, so so, I've had much better. However, it is my opinion that he is used to food and wine that is far above par to that most to us are used to, even in San Francisco.\n\nHOWEVER, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I had a lame duck experience when I took a group of nine people here for my girlfriend's 30th. I got there early to bring two cakes (from Tartine - which were amazing) and several bottles of wine. The hostess was nice, but the manager was very stuffy and difficult - lets say kind of a tart. It seemed like she couldn't even be genuinely nice if she tried, i.e., she basically ruined my experience. They have a corkage fee and a two bottle limit, however, this manager did let me bring three instead of two. Having said that, the hostess only charged me for two by mistake, when I came in early, because I wanted to pay beforehand. But, as I was leaving, the manager told me, rudely, that I had only paid for two, implying that I was a cheap skate and trying to get out of paying for the third. Truthfully, I hadn't even looked at the amount, and just figured they were able to figure it out correctly on their own. [for the record, Park Tavern credits you for corkage with each bottle of wine ordered from the rest - very cool.]  I was just trying to keep the cost down for the group. Nothing is worse than being invited to a birthday party, especially an obligatory one, and being compelled to fork over a bunch of money because folks want to be fancy. Expensive food should be agreed upon by all.\n\nWhen I returned prior to dinner to set up the table with (admittedly crap I bought from party city [an utterly horrible place]) decorations and a balloon, this manager looked at me with horror as if I was some kind of trash.  Geesh, gist trying to make my girlfriend feel special. She was especially horrified by the large mylar happy 30th balloon and asked me where I was going to put it. I was going to ask her to help me decorate the table, her job, but I thought better of enlisting an ice queen to perform what was supposed to be a happy task for a happy occasion.  Luckily some of the female guests arrived shortly thereafter and helped me out. Thanks ladies!\n\nThe waiter was nice, but again a little annoyed that we didn't order right away. We were celebrating and drinking cocktails. He was also a little disappointed that we didn't order more, but as a stated above, they try to get you to over order - and did I mention I had two cakes.  Oh yea, they charge you five bucks a place to cut a piece of cake and put it on a plate. The only consolation is that there is a small serving of some sort of tasty cream. The waiter then seemed annoyed that his automatic tip (large group) wasn't going to be as high as he wished because of the wine we brought and the fact that we didn't feel like over ordering. However, he was happily surprised when he was way over tipped because everyone everyone overpaid and no one wanted any money back. (hell of a group - right!) This changed his tune and he smiled and patted me on the back on the way out. I would like to make it clear that overall, he was a good and attentive waiter, nothing like the ice queen of a manager.\n\nWell, to end my long winded diatribe, which was my attempt at venting, the event turned out well. It was a surprise party, and the birthday girl was surprised. The table looked great, no thanks to the manager, and everyone had a good time! I'm pretty sure that I was the only one that was really miffed by the whole experience as I'm the only one that had any real interaction with this young \"lady\" of a manger. By the way, I thought that folks in the hospitality business were supposed to be, per se, nice, like really nice - especially when your bringing a group of nine to their establishment. However, the group was none to happy when I relayed the store after during drinks. \n\nNuff said. The moral of this story is to try this place out, the food and booze are actually pretty darn good, just be careful not to be forced to over order and beware of the ice queen, well, ice princes.

Everything was made with simple ingredients, but so delicious and flavorful. Highlights:\n\nBruschetta: Served on crispy bread with thick slices of tomatoes and fresh basil.

We left this place content. Not full or stuff. Definitely had room for dessert.\n\n3 reasons for 3 stars:\n1) Price. The price:portion ratio was definitely off. Each small plate was around $10-$13. You literally got 3 bites per dish. Between 3 girls, I only got one bite. =(\n\n2) Menu selection: Although the food was fabulous, the menu was quite small.

Simplicity is fine and actually welcome but this ended up being nothing but average. However, the figs wrapped with prosciutto were great! Although a bit greasy (understandable given the ingredients) there was definitely flavor to this dish, unlike the halibut. Average food bordering on good usually will warrant 3 stars.

Aside from the fact that my friend to the right was dealing with a major illness in her family and my friend to the left was in the midst of a nervous breakdown (and when I say \"in the midst\", I mean tears streaming down her face while sitting at the bar at Terzo), I remained optimistic about enjoying my meal - and hopefully, eventually, my company.  \r\n\r\nWe sat at the bar because there were no seats available - and because, quite frankly, we really wanted to put the apparent misery of our company on full display for all other patrons.  There is a small tapas selection, which was good (we had the spanish cheese and quince and the tortilla); though I do wish that some restaurant/bar in SF would actually do a tapas bar the right way with toothpicks and napkins on the floor and such, but I digress . . .\r\n\r\nThe menu is very small.  This  is not a place to come if you are very hungry, but it is a great place for three chicks to enjoy a lite meal and some vino.  We had the halibut, the chicken, and the lasagna.  The halibut was fantastic and the lasagna was really good as well - really thinly sliced layers.  Good wine list.  I also liked the ambiance of the place.

The inside is a nice space, full of clean lines, and it wasn't too busy.\n\nWe ordered a variety of small plates, including the fried onions (oh, light and crisp and not too greasy), olives (ohhh, delicious, marinated in herbs and full of flavor), and the squash, cut into 1/4-inch sections with the skin still on in the back, with pumpkin seeds (I could try this at home, but not without a _lot_ of attention and care to fresh ingredients).  My friends enjoyed the meat stuff, but I didn't feel deprived, and we all made short work of the bread and hummus dish.  \n\nOur waiter was fun, attentive, and had great suggestions.  When my friend finally picked from the dessert wine menu, the waiter allowed us to chat our way through dessert (a shot of Euro-style hot chocolate hit the spot) then brought a swallow of the other wine under consideration. \n\nProbably not worth visiting if you're vegan -- dairy fat abounds in the veggie dishes.", "author": "KJ M."}

Prominent in that short list is Terzo.\n\nLast night Cheryl was coming from an ArtPoint evening at the de Young and I was coming off the Yelp event at the Space Gallery and we were hoping to grab dinner together. I headed over to Terzo, grabbed a chair at the bar and waited for my girl. I downed a glass of Gigondas and had a bowl of the Sweet Corn Soup with Chives & Creme Fraiche. It really hit the spot although the wine was a bit heavy for it (which I knew going in but...). Cheryl arrived and we the bartender found us a table.\n\nThe rest of the evening was classic Terzo, a true small-plates restaurant. A series of dishes arrived - Hummus with House Made Pita & Za'atar (always great), Grilled Flatbread with Tahini, Feta, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes & Herbs  (really good), Lori's Spicy Italian Sausage with Soft Polenta & Peppers & Onions (actually liked the polenta even more than the sausage), and Grilled Tesa Wrapped Figs with Wild Arugula, Saba & Olive Oil (Cheryl loves figs). She had a glass of the Garnacha, El Chaparral Old Vines, Navarra, Spain, 2005.\n\nThe pacing of the dishes was perfect and service was friendly (although maybe just a bit too much checking to see if all was good which I really can't complain too loudly about). The wine list is good (until recently it carried Chateau Musar, one of my faves and hard to find). The ambiance is terrific and there is a good size common-table area.

They call me 5 minutes before our reservation and tell me the kitchen will be closing and we need to place our order right when we get there.  We get there and the waitress start to badger my party to order, we literally just sat at the table and they had not poured the water yet.  I ask to speak to the manager and he starts to defend this behavior and stated that it was my fault for making a late reservation, I mentioned to him that if he had called me earlier and stated he did not want a 10pm reservation we could have made other arrangements.  We had to leave without having dinner given that no one wanted to eat under the durress of ordering as if we were at McDonald's. Very Unprofessional on his part and I can't imagine we will go back.", "author": "David P."}

We've eaten there several times now and the food has always been tasty. I like the small plates because it lets you try a bunch of different things. \n\nLast week we stopped in for a glass of wine each and a few fun plates. We always start with the hummus here. The hot, herb-seasoned pita slices they server with it are so incredibly delicious. I've tried to recreate the effect at home, but have yet to be successfuly unfortunately. We then shared the roasted artichokes with romesco sauce. OMG, this was one of the best dishes I've ever had! I could have just eaten a huge plate of that. Both of us had our own small plates of the spaghetti dish to finish and thought it was very good. \n\nThe atmosphere at this place is nice too. There is a tall communal table right behind the bar that is fun if you're feeling in a social mood. But there are also many intimate tables as well. It's really a great date spot. \n\nThe bar area is okay, but I think it's a little small and I don't like the fact that there are no backs on the barstools. I've eaten a meal there before and it gets a little uncomfortable after a while without being able to lean back. \n\nI've always found the service here to be quite good and the waitstaff to be friendly and attentive.", "author": "Christine P."}

Nice! (& Salty).  Spinach with poached egg and bits of pancetta. sea bass (sent back), cold roast beef, and a fried calzone type thing with mozarella and a marinara sauce that saved us from going home hungry. \n\nIt's frankly the *perfect* place to go meet for wine (no hard liquor there) and have a bite or two before going home for dinner or our somewhere else for a real meal.

I had a great Cab - the Liparita, Napa 2000.\n\nOur waiter was extremely enthusiastic, friendly and helpful. He would discreetly point out neighboring dishes so we could get visuals...His suggestions were all right on...We especially enjoyed the chicken Spiedini (two skewers) and Panzarotto (a semi-light Calzone).\n\nWhile small plate places are all the range - and can get quite expensive - Terzo's portions seemed to be just right for two people to share 3 + dessert and not leave broke.\n\nAside from having to listen to the woman next to us brag to her friend about how well she married etc. etc., the dining experience was much better than what I expected.

(too much, perhaps?)\n\nthe ambience of this italian/mediterranean tapas bar/restaurant is fantastic. the exposed brick, fun-yet-functional furniture, wood floors, fresh flowers, fireplace, and hanging edison bulbs had me dreaming of a home renovation...\n\nfor dinner, my fiance and i opted for a variety of small plates. apparently the menu changes frequently, but i'll let y'all in on our consumption anyway. (just in case y'all are curious.)\n\nwe ordered the porcini mushroom and fennel salad, baked squash blossoms with ricotta, pork meatballs with polenta, fried-egg topped bruschetta, and ooh, the crispy onions.\n\nthe porcini mushroom and fennel salad was beautiful in its presentation. the mushrooms and fennel were sliced very thin. but something about eating raw mushrooms always gets to me... a good, but not great dish.\n\nand then came the baked squash blossoms filled with ricotta cheese. holy-crap, amazing!!! after eating the raw porcini mushroom and fennel salad, this was exactly what i was yearning for. warm, rich cheese filled veggies. so good. GET THIS!\n\nnext came the fried-egg-topped bruschetta. ORDER THIS! I repeat, ORDER THIS! each order serves up one piece, but the piece if large and can be shared if cut in half. the tomatoes were really sweet, the olive oil, perfection, and perfectly fried egg was so fun to polk... (yes, i like to pop my yolks and have the yellow gooey goodness coat my dishes.) YUMMMMMMMMY!\n\nfinally? out came the pork meatballs and crispy onions. the crispy onions here are to die for. soooooo addictive. you get an entire bowl (large bowl) for five bucks, and you just can't stop reaching for the suckers. YUM. CRACK SNACK!!! ORDER THIS! but the meatballs....... i couldn't help but think that they tasted a bit like chef boyardee meatballs..... a fancy version, of course, but seriously. order these if you want to confirm what i've just said. otherwise, skip.\n \nfor dessert, we shared terzo's vanilla buttermilk panna cotta with summer fruit. heavenly! while some may be freaked out by vanilla specks (insect poop?!), i swear the mere sight of vanilla bean specks makes any vanilla flavored dessert twice as good. as we consumed the dessert, my fiance kept asking me, \"do you know how to make this?\" yes, it was that good.\n\noverall, a wonderful dining experience. i'll be back!", "author": "Debra C."}

The food was good, nice flavor, and a changing menu, we were just passing through getting a drink and appetizer before headed out to a dinner party. We only ordered three items way under her recommended plate number, after that she lost all interest in my table. And because I too was once a waitress, I realized how much I disliked her, but still left an okay tip, not the normal tip I would leave a person in the service industry. \n\nSo why the four stars? I decided to give this place one more chance so my girlfriend and I go back, hoping the evil waitress is not there. Yes!! she's gone, and we get to pick our table, awesome, we want the one in the back. Great food and recommendations, excellent service, always nice to have a waiter buy you a dessert.

First, the staff at Terzo gave our table the wrong bottle of wine. We ended up taking the bottle they gave us instead of the one we ordered, but there were no apologies from the staff.  Additionally, there seemed to be some confusion over which tables were free when we arrived, even though the place was nearly empty, and which dishes we had ordered.\n\nOn the plus side, the beets, meatballs, and pita with hummus were all tasty and worked well with the small/shared dishes concept. The beets were particularly flavorful (surprising, since I usually dislike beets and find them tasteless, or worse, tasting like only dirt) and complemented by a refreshingly tart cream/yogurt sauce and crunchy picked onions. The meatballs and pita were also good, but very heavy on the olive oil and rich. Sharing them is definitely the way to go!\n\nOf the food, the only dish that wasn't uniformly delicious and rich was the chicken skewers.

I find that it is easier to get a table without a reservation earlier in the evening (like when it just opens) or if all else fails, grabbing a seat at the bar makes for a lovely yet interesting meal. \n\nI love the Sea Bass mainly for the garbanzo beans. They taste like little balls of olive oil. So good! and the Skirt Steak is like butter (but doesn't have any on it).  \n\nThe light bulbs over the tables give off a warm glow and when the weather warrants it, they light up the  fire place which transforms the restaurant into a mini vacation. \n\nThe servers are very knowledgeable and are not overbearing. They give informed suggestions on food and wine pairings which I love. I know my wine (enough) but always ask for recommendations because lets face it, even two Pinot Grigios from the same vintage and region are going to be vastly different and unique. \n\nI think this place is great. Even their staff is good looking. Who can beat that? Good food AND eye candy??? Get real!", "author": "J R."}

It's a pretty large restaurant, so they can accommodate quite a crowd.\nWe enjoyed a fantastic beet dish, baby artichokes, baked lingcod, and a housemade pasta with tarragon and marscapone. Everything was top-notch, especially the fish and the beets. We're pretty picky about our food and everything was up to our snobbish standards.\n\nWines were pretty obscure/interesting. Since I was kind of lost, the server offered me tastes of various options before I selected the glass I was having. That's a really nice touch, especially when you're spending $10 on a glass of wine. I wound up getting something I really liked and would never have found otherwise.\n\nPortion sizes for the veggie small plates was pretty big actually.

My hubby and I aren't the kind to linger at the table once we've paid the bill, but we were engaged in conversation while I finished the last of our bottle of wine. I was pretty taken aback when the hostess came over and asked us if we had used the valet service so she could call for our car (which we didn't -- we walked to the restaurant). I guess that was her way of asking us to hit the road?? I understand there are other reservations, but it would have been nice if that was explained to us or if we were offered a seat at the bar or something.

We were a group of 4 and ordered 4 small plates (server had recommended 3-4 small plates per person + a couple of big plates, but we ordered perfectly). Hummus with housemade pita, an amazing bruschetta with a fried egg, fried (greek) Haloumi cheese and roasted morels w/ asparagus. Each one better than the next. For the big plates, we ordered the salmon (a tiny bit overcooked but good) & the Greek-style chicken. Chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, but only a thigh/leg combo...not much to share for $20.

The hummus was predictable but still good. \nI thought the table were placed a wee bit too close together for my liking. It's one thing to choose to sit at a communal table but to have the table next to you eavesdropping to not only your conversation but the people on the other side of you is a different story.

Making the list of SF Gate's Top 100 Restrauants, I expected a good meal for two for around $100. What I got was a bad meal and bad service, with the only thing surpassing my expectations being the $130 bill. And yes, I \"get\" the whole tapas, small plates genre - that's not my quarrel. My specific complaints are as follows (I've even shortened them substantially): \n\nHouse Cured Meats: for about $15 you get 6 slices of salami, the amount & quality of which you can find on an average slice of pizza. I'm Italian, live in North Beach, & spent a year living in Rome. Please just give me the benefit of the doubt on this one.\nBad Service: Wobbly table, smack in the middle of two other tables - when \"cozy with your fellow diners\" crosses into \"get your bad breath away from me\" territory.  At the end of the meal, we were given the WRONG check; upon kindly informing our Server, she tried to tell us otherwise! When she realized her error, a curt response of \"oh yeah\" was all she could muster.  The last police officer who gave me a speeding ticket was more apologetic AND deserving of a tip.\nOverpriced: My $250 two-person meal at Farallon was like the Louisiana Purchase in comparison, making my meal at Terzo akin to buying stock in Bear Stearns. It's not that the meal was worthless, but at $60 (not $130) I felt like buyer & seller both could have left the deal satisfied.\n\nThe one good thing about Terzo is that it directly lead to my participation in Yelp.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-09-10", "description": "Update: \n\nI originally rated this at 5 stars. Time for a major bump-down. Yes, the food was still fantastic the last time I was there, BUT they made a major, huge restaurant no-no, in my book: \n\nWe had reservations for 7 pm. We got there at 10 'til. They had us sit in the bar area while we waited... and waited.... and waited..... for 50 minutes - that's 40 minutes past our original reservation time. Just to add insult to injury, the only time the host or hostess came by was to give us a wan, obsequious smile and shoulder-shrug that said  \"Ooops... Sorry... looks like it's going to be a 'little' bit longer.\" We got lame excuses about people taking too long to pay their check and clear out (not my business, not my problem), that it would only be a few more minutes (total B.S.), etc, and NOBODY offered to hook us up with something to nosh on in the meantime, like a free app or something on the house (HELLO - we're friggin' HUNGRY here... we had planned on eating by now... If we hadn't have planned on it, we would have eaten something before we left the house). Lame, lame lame lame lame lame. \n\nLook, we were a two-top for cripes sake. If you can't figure out how to seat a deuce within 20 minutes of the reservation time, it's time to fire the hosts & hostesses and consider a different seating layout of your restaurant. Or, better yet, just stop taking reservations. What's the point of offering this service if you can't honor it? \n\nThe experience was inexcusable, especially for mid-week. I DID love the food here, but I will be very hard-pressed to go back. It's just not worth the roullette of \"will I get seated before I pass out from sugar-low or not?\"\n\n--- ORIGINAL REVIEW --- 5 stars\n\nMark Gordon's latest endeavor is another big win. If you're familiar with Rose's Cafe, which is across the street from Terzo, then you already know the beauty of Mark's fresh produce selection and his talent for delicately balancing traditional flavors with fresh concepts. \n\nThe menu is concieved around small plates that are meant to be shared at the table, not unlike tapas, but without the straight up spanish influence. Terzo's dishes are pan-european, I'd say, in their offering... ranging from a mediterranean chicken skewer dish to a fresh mozzarella / heirloom tomato salad offering. \n\nThe real trick to this food is how fresh everything is. I cannot emphasize this enough. Gordon's focus on quality is evident in his selection of local vegetable purveyors... on our first night at Terzo, we tried the mozzarella / heirloom tomato salad, which all in all, given how commonly this dish appears on restaurant menus, would be difficult to elevate to a \"supreme\" level... yet, that's exactly what happened. \n\nMy husband and I cut into the dish and took our first taste and were immediately awash in the simple beauty of the salad's blend of perfect olive oil dancing with either a grey salt or a sea salt and the explosion of the tomatos counterbalanced by the mellowness of the mozzarella that combined to a perfect bite. These \"perfect bites\" are rare, where everything presents in a single moment as a piqued, balanced and varied gastronomic extravaganza, almost a complete meal's-worth of flavors and textures in a single mouthful that my husband refers to as the \"kevane bite.\" Dee licious. \n\nAfter this one mouthful, I looked at my husband, stunned, and said, \"There is something seriously wrong with this world where we can stroll into a restaurant on a Saturday night in a world-class city like SF without reservations and have such perfect food.\" Granted, we had come in at 11 PM (in keeping with the tapas ethos, Gordon has kept the hours more european at Terzo, allowing for the later-evening crowd to wander in), and San Francisco does tend to roll up its sidewalks early, but if this restaurant were in NY, even at 11 there would have been a line out the door.", "author": "Hannah Q."}

They've made the portions more substantial and upped the prices a bit, but overall the experience is still satisfying.\n\nFood:  3 stars.   The menu is now divided between an assortment of small plates and 4-5 larger plates, along with two sides.  Some items were spot on, while others left me perplexed.  Of the small plates, I thoroughly enjoyed the hummus plate, the goat skewers and the free range chicken spiedini.  The baked goat cheese was decent, but there was not enough toasted baguette slices in proportion to the cheese and fig preserves.  For the larger plates, we had the grilled coho salmon, grilled organic pork chop, and grilled niman ranch skirt steak.  The juicy pork chop, served with spatzle, roasted turnips and apple compote, was my fave.  The skirt steak, served with roasted potatoes, radicchio, and salsa verde, was an average dish and not too inspiring.  I absolutely hated the salmon, which came with a over-charred skin.  I enjoyed the garbanzo beans that it came with more than the ashy flavor of the salmon itself.  The worst part about it is that the waiter said it was the last one left, so we had higher expectations for it.  We also ordered a side of crispy onions, which were decent but a bit too salty.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate pudding cake with whipped cream and scoops of sherry-prune (think rum raisin) and mint confetti ice cream.  The cake by itself was delicious, but was marred by the ice cream flavors (the mint confetti reminded me of medicine).\n\nService:  4 stars.   Our server was awesome.  He was super friendly, humorous, and played off of my lame jokes.  His menu recommendations (the pork chop, goat skewers, chicken spiedini) were spot on, but I really wish he didn't try to go above and beyond to get us that last salmon.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.  The place is still somewhat trendy and chic, yet warm and inviting (thanks in large part to the central fireplace).  The crowd is generally attractive and young, but sometimes a little crass (there was some inappropriate conversation at the table to our left, don't bring the kiddies!).\n\nHits:   Hummus, grilled pork chop.\n\nMisses:  Coho salmon, mint confetti ice cream.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  COCO500, Cortez, Laiola", "author": "Keith C."}

The dishes were good, with the highlight being the Bruscetta of tomatoes panchetta and fried egg.  The Calzone was extremely boring and tasted a bit like a hot pocket and the bean salad was a bit overwhelmed by the Thyme.  The Squash Carpaccio was a nice dish, but no real wow factor, and really enjoyed the Calamari, Clams and pasta dish(Favorite part was the dipping the bread in the sauce).", "author": "Steven S."}

We were seated right away upon arriving, and althought the quarters were close, we suprisingly didn't feel cramped or crowded.  Our waitress was extrmely attentive and offered great wine and food suggestions, all of which we took and loved!  Food came quickly, although we didn't feel rushed, and I loved the way that their portions are set up so that you share....really gave us an opportunity to try multiple things on the menu.  On top of everything else, the decor was simple yet inviting and had a really modern-chic look to it.  I would definitely go back to Terzo in a heart beat.....also, it seemed like it would be a great place to go with a (moderately sized) group too.", "author": "Liz L."}

We love to try lots of different things. \n\nEach dish was perfectly prepared and presented. We ordered 4 small plates to share and were impressed with the way they paced the delivery of each one. The dishes came in exactly the order requested. We were not hurried through any of the selections. \n\nThe white wine flight was also a nice way to sample several wines. Our waitress, Niccole, was especially adept at describing each wine; one could almost taste them just from her description. \n\nWe chose the chicken spiendini, arugula salad, panzarotto &amp; marinara and tomato braised pork meatballs. As mentioned earlier, each dish was excellent. Our particular favorite was the panzarotto, which Niccole explained was made with potato dough. It was like a calzone except the bread was delicate and more delicious. \n\nThe ending was a simple vanilla ice cream sundae with cappuccino, a delightful and perfect finish.\n\nWe could not have been more pleased with this experience and plan to return to Terzo on our next visit to SF.", "author": "Cindy T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-18", "description": "Where o where do I begin?  I guess the beginning is a good place to start.  Overall, it was a good restaurant.  \n\nFinding the Restaurant:  It's very easy to just walk/ drive by it without noticing that it's there.  There is no visible sign, just a metal rooster hanging out front.\n\nParking: Everyone who hangs out in the area knows about parking.  It's hard to find.  They do offer valet parking for $10.   Sometimes, valet parking is worth it in that area if you don't want to circle the block for a long time.  By the way, I saw their Vallet guys park some of the cars in the street, so if you can find street parking, you saved $10.  \n\nAmbiance:  It's a very cozy place.  It's cute and trendy.  The lighting is very nice.  If you can, take the back room.  You may feel like the bad kids put in the corner, but it's definitely a lot roomier than the front.  If you don't like loud music, don't sit in the back room.  The music was so loud that the staff couldn't hear us when we called them.  One of the hostesses even came by and said she'd turn down the music because it was too loud.  I did like sitting underneath the large skylight.  It made for a nice dining experience.\n\nStaff:  The service was below par.  The table we were seated at was wobbly, and it took 20 minutes before someone bothered to help us with it.  We tried to get everyone's attention, but apparently we were invincible.  The service itself took longer than it really needed to considering it wasn't full and they had a full staff.  However, our waiter was a really nice guy and that made the service no so bad.  Heck, we even gave him a big tip.\n\nFood:  If you are hungry, don't go here.  You'll still be starving before the meal is done.  They suggest 2 to 3 plates per person.  I'd go with three.  Food is brought to the table one dish at a time.  It kind of makes you wonder where the rest of the food is and how long it'll take to get to your table.  If you're there to talk and /or drink more than eat, then service is fine.  If you're there to eat, you'll wonder how many hours and dishes it'll take before you get full.  The food itself is delicious.  They change their menu daily except for about 4 regular dishes they keep on the menu.  By the way, if you don't like onions, you may want to tell the waiter ahead of time.  Almost everything we ordered had onions.  Here's what we ate:\n\nBlackberry Italian Soday:  it's very refreshing and delicious\nHummus:  The pita was delicious.  The hummus was a bit too dry even though they drizzled olive oil on it.  \nPorcini & Sweet Corn Salad: If you don't like fennel, you won't like this salad.  I'm a big mushroom fan, so I liked it.  It's a very light salad.\nSummer Squash Salad: Get it!  It was nice and light.  I can see why it's a favorite.\nArugula Salad: It's a very simple and delicious salad.  One of my favorite kinds.\nChicken skewers:  They give 2 hearty skewers per order.  It's very tasty.  When you look at it, it seems like a lot of chicken.  Then, when you look closer, it's actually toasted spicy bread mixed with chicken.\nNiman Beef: They say it's cooked medium rare, but it's more rare.  If you don't like to look at rare meat, this plate is NOT for you.  Two of the people with me couldn't even eat it.  \nFlatbread:  It's very tasty.  MMM Balsamic Vingear goodness!  It's drizzled with so many herbs and nuts.  Very mediterranean.\nJamon Serrano Bruschetta:  Very hammy and very cheezy!  I loved it.  \nFried Onion Strings: Too salty, too oily, not crunchy enough.  But since I'm a sucker for onion strings, I liked it.\nDessert: go elsewhere unless you're getting the homemade ice cream.  The semolina wheat cake was like eating flavorless couscous.  The minute you bit into it, it crumbled...and not in a good way.  The strawberry and rose cream with merangue - just eat strawberries at home.  When I imagine merengue, I imagine fluffy goodness.  On this dessert, it was a small flat square.  The cream tasted like regular creme even though it's supposed to be rose cream.  The strawberries were covered with what looked like sugary syrup ( think strawberry pie).  It was good, but not worth getting again.", "author": "Miss T."}

The small plates here are Mediterranean and awesome, but very unique from what you'll find at other similarly styled restaurants. Portions are smallish so order 5-6 dishes for two. My favorite was the steamed mussels served in some sort of north African broth (best I've ever had - order extra bread to soak it all up). The wine list is great with lots to offer (both by the glass and bottle) from outside of CA. \n\nFrom the outside, the place looks like a regular house, but  inside, the decor is sleek and modern with great (low) lighting that makes everybody look good. Even though it's in the heart of the Marina, the place maintains it's sleek elegance late into a Friday evening when most similarly situated restaurants (even nice ones) turn into sloppy frat parties (which is OK sometimes, but not when you're out for dinner with the GF). Go there on a date, then get tanked at any number of bars nearby.\n\nService and staff are great - the place is owned by the same group that owns Rose Pistola (North Beach) and Rose's Cafe nearby.", "author": "Ez G."}

It's the type of place you can roll in off the street after a long day or week. It would be great for a first date or an anniversary. I found it to be inviting and unpretentious. It is a little expensive but I expect that from a quality restaurant that uses fresh ingredients that makes their own mustard, desserts, pita bread, etc. Terzo also has the ambiance and service to back the price tag.\n\nThe food was incredible. The menu is designed to share, small and larger plates. The pita and hummus was the best I have ever had. Have you ever tasted fresh, made to order pita bread? Me neither, you will never want store bought again. The crispy soft shell crab resting on a bed of crisp green beans, tomatoes with a shallot vinaigrette was perfect and I was lucky to get the last one. The skirt steak was perfectly pink with the right amount of crispness on the outside and the flavor divine. For dessert we split the midnight cake, GOODNIGHT! It was perfectly moist a little dense and with a bite of the whipped cream I felt like I was eating the \"Ritz Carlton\" version of a ho ho!\n\nBetter yet was our service, Casey was helpful, knowledgeable, and absolutely charming.

Maybe we made a mistake in going for large plates, some of the small plate dishes on neighbouring tables looked and smelt more uplifting.My pork loin was excellently cooked but could have done with more seasoning or a suace to lift the rather bland flavour. The braised cabbage and spaetzle which accompanied it really had no flavour at all. My friend's chicken served on a bed of Orzo pasta was equally bland and about a third of the size of the portion I'd eaten elsewhere the night before for about the same price. My dessert of chocolate midnight cake was moist and light but lacked the big chocolate hit one might have expected whilst my friend's sundae consisted of two scoops of ice cream with a squirt of chantilly cream and a drizzle of sauce. On the plus side there's a reasonable range of well kept beers, service was friendly and prompt and the decor and ambience are very good. But this was our most expensive meal around Cow Hollow and by far the least satisfying. I also couldn't quite understand their adding a 1.5% service charge (yes that's right not 15% but 1.5%).

I feel like this place has solid food, atmosphere and ambiance but could definitely benefit from a Yelp review on service.  I came here in April to take my best friend to dinner for her bday since I was missing her bday celebration (yes, I am a big slacker and never got around to yelping about this till now).  The food was pretty good.  Nothing super memorable although I liked their homemade pita and hummus.  I had two major problems with Terzo.  One, the server brought us a side of olives at the very beginning.  Neither of us had ever been to Terzo so we assumed that every table gets this.  About 10 minutes later, the server tells us he made a mistake and the olives weren't supposed to be for us.  He asks if he wants us to take them away; since, we had been eating them for the last 10 minutes, i don't really see the harm in leaving the rest on the table.  When it was the end of the meal, I let the server know it was my BFF's bday and so he immediately sweeps up the dessert menus and tells us it's taken care of.  we got the dessert - something with chocolate, pretty good but not anything to rave about.  Well, the check comes and it turns out that he charged us for both the olives and the dessert.  WHAT??  the olives were his mistake..that makes no sense he would charge us for it.  and if i had said, go ahead and take away the olives, would he have then given the remainder of my half-eaten portion to the rightful table?  Or, did my assent that he could leave them on the table, meant that I actually ordered them?  Also, with dessert...i feel like its pretty normal that most restaurants comp it when its somebody's bday.  but if you aren't going to comp it, then let us pick the dam dessert!  I'm fine with chocolate but if ain't free, you better believe I'm going to take my sweet time looking at all the options and deciding what looks most appetizing.  not huge errors in service, but definitely something they could work on...consider this your constructive feedback terzo.", "author": "Cathy L."}

Tonight the service felt very rushed which was a very different experience than my prior ones. I was with a couple of friends and we were in deep discussion about an important topic when we were abruptly interrupted by the hostess \"asking if we valet parked\" ie: we need your table, so let's go ... now, if she was a good hostess, she would have taken notice that we did not valet. Of course, this rude interruption of our conversation made it quickly end and we headed for the door. When I approached the hostess and let her know that I thought her behavior was rude, she was quick to blame it on our server. Poor form all around. Disappointing experience.", "author": "Kristin P."}

My friend and I and her boyfriend had 6 small plates and each was absolutely out of this world.  YUM.  Meatballs over polenta.  fig bruschetta.   SO good and so wonderfully San Francisco.", "author": "Katie C."}

The wine was excellent as was the service, ambiance, decor and vibe.  I forgot my jacket at the restaurant and called and asked them to hold it for me until I could pick it up the next day. Somehow it was stolen.  Management and the owners were professional and handled the situation extremely well, apologizing profusely and reimbursing me for the jacket.  I look forward to dining at Terzo next time I am in San Francisco.", "author": "G X."}

The plates were way small, and yes, I understand they're supposed to be small plates, but at $10-$15  per, I expect a little more in both quantity [for 3 people we had around 8 plates, still hungry afterwards] and complexity. The dishes were good but plain; they tasted fine but nothing that stands out. Great ambience but I wouldn't go back.", "author": "Tina L."}

They don't serve bread, which for me can be a deal breaker -- and the \"small\" plates are very small for the price.  The food is excellent but i think they need to work on their portion size...considering we ordered a pizza when we got home!  I'll give them a few weeks to work out some kinks and give it another try.", "author": "Liz H."}

We were lucky enough to be one of the first groups to reserve the private back room that will fit 10 people comfortably.  With a skylight and window to a little garden (?), the room is cozy and perfect for a group dinner.  While you wait for your table, you can have a glass of wine and some tapas ($4 a plate).   The steamed muscles and broccoli are a must.  Bartenders and Servers were awesome.", "author": "Nancy J."}

The hummus is delicious, especially the warm and olive-oily naan bread that accomanies it- the brushetta is also a good, especially with the fried egg on top twist. The small plates are a better value and tastier than the large plates- the wine is great and the environment is tough to beat!", "author": "Cynthia P."}

The candlight and fireplace make it very charming and cozy.  It's small plates served family style.  The portion size is extremely small, so be prepared to each order 2-3 plates.  I gave it 3 stars because the food was solid, but nothing off the charts spectacular.  I also thought the female bartendar was a bit snotty.  They have a seabass that was quite tasty, as was the beet salad.  I thought the salmon was sort of salty and fishy.  The only thing I had that I thought was worth of 4 star rating was the flourless chocolate cake....yummmmy!  They have valet parking as well.  It's a nice local spot, and I'd definitely go back for a date or something.", "author": "clancy t."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-07", "description": "I was shocked at the treatment of our host last week.  A respected gentleman and long time patron of this restaurant he had made specific table reservations well in advance of our dinner - and called twice that week to confirm the table. We arrived on time.  The hostess was clueless and unhelpful in locating the reserved table...we were placed by the bathroom-kitchen entrance, set for 5, we had a window seat reserved for 6.  The \"GM\" asked my wife, not the host, how he could help....and then he did not help...the waitress was agressive ....I have dined here three times previously in the past 3 years and it has gotten worse in food quality and service.  There were no apologies...unbelievable....for any customer let alone a long time customer this was a shocking display of how to not run a restaurant.  An apology and show of deference makes a big difference when a mistake is made...but Terzo kept making it worse.", "author": "andrew m."}

The atmosphere is great and I've had excellent service every time. This feels like a local place to me, pretty down to earth while providing the important combination of good food, service and atmosphere. I'd say 2 dishes per person is enough.", "author": "Peter J."}
