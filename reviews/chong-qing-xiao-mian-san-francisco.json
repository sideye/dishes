These noodles and soups are the ultimate comfort food, and I look forward to many more experiences here! They do have a kick of spice, but it adds an extra punch of flavor to the food. I will admit it is greasy like others mention. I don't mind this, however. I like to think it adds to the flavor of the broth. \n\nI've only had the Tan Tan Noodles and was impressed! I do want to try the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and many other items. During lunch, get cozy with those around you. If it's busy and the tables are taken, you'll be sat in the long row of connected tables where you could be eating next to strangers. I thought it was unique as this is only something I'd seen in China. I'm glad they aren't afraid to keep their ways in America.\n\nThe service is quick and to the point. Don't expect the server to come to you. You have to wave them down.\n\nGroups larger than four may be a mistake if it is too crowded. The smaller the better in my opinion! It's location is in the less touristy part of Chinatown, and the prices are reflective with most items ranging around $10-$11. You'll also get a view into the kitchen with the staff rushing around and yelling orders. I cannot wait for my next stop here and sharing it with the world!", "author": "Brandon S."}

I've gone to MANY Sichuan restaurants throughout California, and this is one that's definitely got it on point. I haven't written a review for a while, but after eating at this place, I just had to. The people who work here definitely hustle, we got our food about 10-15 mins after our order was taken. \n\nBeef w/ Spicy Five Flavor: only $4.95!!\n- Good serving size for the price (enough for 2). Served cold, but still delicious. \n- Very good spice flavor -- not spicy though, but you can add the red chili oil that they have on the table.\n\nTan Tan Noodle: $9.95\n- Pork, cabbage, noodles in chili oil. \n- Perfect balance of spicy-ness and umami, not too spicy but the chili flakes will get to your throat if you eat it too fast. \n\nWon-Ton with Spicy Chili Oil & Chicken Broth: $9.95\n- Big bowl of pork won-tons, cabbage in chili oil and chicken broth. \n- AMAZING combination. Won-tons made fresh (you can tell that they made them to order, not frozen). Perfect texture when taking a bite with a little bit of broth. \n- Loved the broth so much, added the beef in and ate after eating the won-tons. \n\nThis place is truly a gem, I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Cindy M."}

My favorite dish is their pickled vegetable with beef noodle soup. It is a giant bowl and I was never able to finish the noodles, the broth and the beef. I also tried the hot and sour glass noodles, which is very unique and tasty. Both noodle soups are quite authentic and flavorful. During lunch and dinner time, they are quite busy so expect to wait a bit. \n\nOne thing that I hope they would improve is the greasiness.

Many of the noodles have chili oil in them and lots of seasoning, which makes the noodles great and balanced but the soup is a bit too much. There are a few noodles with clear broths like the Guiling noodles so just be aware of what you're getting. I personally like the Chong Qing noodles and the mustard greens beef noodles. I'd skip the Tan Tan (or Dandan) noodles though as I'm accustomed to them being more of a dry noodle dish but they serve them here as a sort of soup noodle. \n\nIf you don't just want noodles (but that's why you're here!) you can also order some side dishes.

While a more traditional dandan mian comes with much less soup, CQXM's dandan were so delicious and really hit the spot. It was the perfect hot (not blazing), soothing meal before a long road trip and there's definitely a lot of flavor, the little bits of pork you get in every bite was perfect and not at all overwhelming. Don't drink the soup, it's covered in oil for flavoring the noodles. The spiciness level isn't hot at all and my tolerance for spiciness is pretty mediocre. I actually added a giant spoon of their chili oil and it was still just okay.\n\nMy husband had their pork rib soup and rice. It comes with back bones therefore not a ton of meat. The flavor of the broth was rich and tasted exactly like many soups I had in China as a kid. I could've drank it all. They add a lot of napa cabbage to the bottom of the soup so if you aren't a fan, this probably isn't the dish for you.\n\nWe also had the lamb skewers (can't pass on trying this since Xi'an is my hometown), scallion pancake, and the sweet and sour short ribs. The skewers weren't my favorite; they could've been great, but I think the cook that morning didn't care too much and seasoned one side of the meat, leaving the other 3 sides pretty plain and gross. It's sloppy cooking. The parts where the cumin & other spices came through were tasty. \n\nHusband really enjoyed the sweet and sour ribs because they were basically char siu ribs repurposed with some vinegar, and he loves char siu anything. The scallion pancake was cooked unevenly though the parts that were neither overdone or underdone were crispy yet chewy, everything you'd want in your scallion pancakes. It was too oily to eat a lot of after the dandan noodles.\n\nService was nice for a Chinese restaurant, the ladies were very polite and made sure we had everything.

Maybe there was just a mix up on the day that I got takeout....\n\nI ordered a beef noodle and lamb skewers. My takeout showed up, and I pulled out the dark, glistening bowl of chili oil. I was so ready to light my mouth on fire. Scoop 1: cabbage. Scoop 2: cabbage. Wait a minute, did they forget the beef? Yup, they did. Called them up and got a second delivery. I guess they must've thought they didn't forget it, because I got about 3 pieces of beef for my $13.50 dish. Yikes. To their credit, the beef itself was tender, with nice lines of sinew running through it. That being said, more beef would have been appreciated. The noodles were freshly made and had a great bounce. Taste: 3.75/5. Value: 2/5.\n\nI lived in Beijing for four months and really missed getting lamb skewers on the side of the street, especially after a night of clubbing (so yes, this is like a bajillion years ago). Lamb was tender and chewy, and the value here was adequate. Nothing beats the nostalgia of Beijing lamb skewers though. 3.5/5.", "author": "Nicole H."}

After today, five it is.\n\nPro tip on what's going on here is to start with this:\nhttp://spicykingsf.com/\nThe mothership is a spot called Spicy King and something else entirely if you read the hanzi name but suffice to say they started out a few years ago with that more banquet-y locale with the longer menu up the hill on Waverly and have been quietly carving out a minor Sichuanese empire throughout the Bay ever since.\n\nOur present subject opened a few years later slinging noodle bowls priced to go pitched to a ravenous inter-FiDi/Chinatown lunch crowd. More pale faces in attendance now than a few months ago but still a distinct minority, and you'll do better on service with a few confirmatory side comments in Mandarin, or you can communicate that way exclusively and probably get through the process faster.\n\nOn earlier visits they seemed to present everything in a standard full-fire chili oil bath that overpowered everything else. More recently they've opted for a thinner but still flavorful broth with a bucket of hua jiao loaded oil on the side; spoon in to taste; and it works out better for everyone. I'll always take a few spoonfuls in my noodles and that does the trick for me; you'll always have that option unless you start with the eponymous Chong Qing Xiao Mian dish, in which case spice is the main event and you asked for it. My happy place is any of the noodle bowls with pickled vegetables. And until today I had put off trying the version with fish, but today I went straight for the Fish with Pickled Vegetables noodle bowl, and well, five stars, and it's going to be hard to explore very much else now that I know that's available.\n\nThe front side of the menu deserves attention too. I and a work colleague seem to have settled on a system of one noodle bowl each plus fried squid and steamed vegetables to start. Everything balances perfectly and it's about the right amount for two hungry people. I also haven't encountered the service issues others mention. This is a hole-in-the-wall version of a Chinese noodle stand presented in all its authentic, no-frills, take-it-or-leave-it style; the food is great; a dollar or two more than I'd like but a steal for FiDi; and everyone's always been nice enough to me to carry out the essential noodles-for-dollars business at hand.

Their noodles are chewy and don't seem like the generic texture-less ones you'll find at most places. I polished off my bowl completely. \n\nWe also ordered the tendon/beef and scallion pancake. They were only $5 each so might as well.

However, service is quick to serve out food and clean up tables so the wait isn't too bad at all. \n\nReally decent sichuan here. The flavors are what you'd expect -- strong, spicy and tons of chili. \n\nThe soup broth here is extremely flavorful regardless of what you order. Super oily (which makes it a broth that you shouldn't really drink) and and immersed in tons of chili. Despite being so chili infused and red, it's not overwhelming at all! It really adds to the overall taste of your noodle dish or dumplings etc. \n\nWe ordered the tan-tan noodles and spicy beef noodles. No regrets on both! \n\nWe also ordered an appetizer which was tender beef in 5 flavors ($4.95). It was chewy and decently portioned for an appetizer but not as flavorful as what you'd expect from the name. \n\nOverall, a very easy spot for Sichuan cuisine! Fast and efficient service, but definitely not a place to slowly enjoy your food. Lines get long and the space itself isn't too big. Very fast moving and loud environment.", "author": "Kimberly G."}

Some of the tables are shared with other customers, but I didn't mind that\n-We got the guilin noodles and the classic numbing noodles. The guilin is a great non spicy option and the texture of the noodles is unlike anything I've had before, so soft and chewy. The broth of the numbing noodles is literally the best flavor ever, it's hard to describe. It is rich, spicy, nutty, and overall just addicting. The noodles were a little different than the guilin, not quite as good but still decent. \n-Would recommend getting one of their yogurt drinks if you can't handle spice very well\n-For about $10 for a bowl of noodles this place is the best.", "author": "Jason C."}

I went slightly before 12 so there were plenty of open tables at the time, but as noon came the place got pretty crowded. They accept credit cards here which is a nice plus too.\n\nFor about $10, the Tan Tan noodles were a fair price, and like many other Szechuan dishes, this one also had that numbing spicy taste to it. The noodles themselves were quite excellent, they tasted pretty freshly made and I enjoy the texture and taste of them. Unfortunately the rest of the dish didn't come out as good as I would have hoped.\n\nThe dish itself needs a bit more salt, it is a bit plain despite all of the flavor from the spiciness. They do offer you some sauce at the table that contains black beans which can make it a little saltier, but that also comes with a bunch of other flavors as well. \n\nThe minced meat pieces were okay, the flavoring is a bit more sour than I am used to, but they were still good enough. Overall though, for the price they charge I need more than just the noodles to be top notch.", "author": "Tyler T."}

While there was a good portion of thinly shaved lamb in the soup, it was a bit tough and chewy for my tastes. \n\nThe dan dan noodles also had an al dente texture, but were a bit bland with the sauce so it really needed the strong, concentrated flavor of the ground meat mixed with it well.

Originally from Asia, I'm used to the grease of Chinese food, and of course expected loads of spicy chili oil all over my noodles, but it was pretty excessive here. To the point I felt disgusted. \n\nI came with two others, and we ordered the tantan (dandan) mian, beef brisket noodles, wontons in chili oil, fried potstickers, and the pickled cucumber. \n\nThe best dish by far was the pickled cucumber, which was actually well-marinated, delicious, and refreshing. \n\nThe pot stickers' skin was too thick and slightly undercooked in places, and they were severely under-filled. Semi-cooked tough dough anyone?\nAlso, I usually love the wontons in chili oil (a dish I always get when I'm back in Asia), but these were pretty pathetic. They're also usually a side dish when served in Asia, not served swimming in broth in a massive noodle bowl. Again, severely under-filled wontons. All I ate was a ton of wonton skin--wasn't even sure if you could qualify these as wontons...?\n\nBeef brisket was pretty tasty, but there were all of two pieces in the \"beef brisket noodle\". Again, massive bowl, but you'll find it's 90% noodle, 10% meat (no exaggeration). Finally, dan dan mian was huge bowl again, but just, noodle and oil and a bit of minced meat.\n\nI was pretty disappointed. The flavors were somewhat there, and the cucumber was really good, but apart from that, expect huge bowls filled with noodles and barely any meat/ toppings.

A bit overcooked and probably left in the slow cooker all day, but it was 2 for $2 and nice marinade.\n\nGreen Onion Pancake - $4.95.  Popular with everyone this is a great non-spicy dish and good for soaking up sauce.\n\nMouth Watering Szechuan Style Chicken - $4.95.  Despite the interesting name, this dish is legit with free range chicken in a nice sauce with a slight numbing that is authentic and flavorful.  It's a bit on the cold side and has bean sprouts that soak up the spicy sauce.  Great with rice.\n\nFatty Pork Belly - $7.95.  The picture looks great but the portion size is smaller and a bit overcooked and salty as a result.  There is nice fat, but the lean portions are not juicy anymore and you need to drink water with this dish.\n\nOverall, we had a great meal here.

Our noodles came before the vegetables and were SOO HUGE - they gave us so many noodles and we both couldn't finish. Compared to other szechuan restaurants, I didn't think these were spicy or numbing at all. But the broth warmed our souls, and the table had a huge jar of black bean sauce from which I added generous scoops of sauce into my soup. The chunks of beef that came with my soup reminded me of home and were very tender and yummy. I was pretty happy.", "author": "Yenny Z."}

The service is pretty horrible here as we put our name down and was standing by the door outside waiting and they didn't call our names but let another party in and seated them before us even though we clearly arrived first.\n\nOnce our table of 4 was cleared, no one came to tell us that our table was ready and didn't tell us to sit down and proceeded to take orders from other tables and just let us stand and wait by the door until we asked if this table was ours, even though one of workers there had previously asked how many people were in our party and knew we were waiting to be seated.\n\nWhile we were looking At the menu and waiting for someone to take our order, the waitress said \"hurry up\" in mandarin. I'm not fluent in mandarin but I know what that means! Also, how do we \"hurry up\" when we weren't even able to flag you down so that we can put our order in? Our customer service experience was terrible, but it might be better for those who are older or who speak Chinese fluently.. \n\nAnyways, we all ordered the tan tan noodle and two appetizers to share - the green onion pancake and the sweet and sour spareribs. The green onion pancake was pretty good, similar to other places I've had them at. The spareribs were not even sweet and sour. They had this different flavor to it maybe like those Asian vinegar eggs? I had one and had to pass on it. We all didn't like it very much. The   Tan tan noodles itself was pretty good, however it was pretty spicy and some of my coworker's including myself, couldn't handle it. The spiciness is kind of like the numbing spice so it's different from the usual spicy taste, but still good if you can handle it. \n\nI really wanted to try the non spicy items on the menu like the pork bone noodle soup, but I'm not so sure after the horrible service we experienced..", "author": "Bailey L."}

This type of spicy noodles is the burning spice. How this restaurant works is that it starts off with Chong Qing Xiao Mian which is the base. The Chong Qing Xiao mian consists of noodles, the numbing spice broth (a spicy that is numbing, not burning), noodles, and green onions, napa cabbage, and some meat. Every other soup dish is usually the chong qing xiao mian with extra garnishes or slightly different broths.\n\nMy friend and I came to Chong Qing Xiao Mian on a Monday at around 5:45pm. It was fairly empty at this time so we were seated promptly. My friend and I ordered the cucumber salad, spicy numbing beef tendon (beef tendon served cold in spicy chili oil), szechaun style Pork Belly, the chong qing xiao mian, and the Ginger Duck Noodle soup. A really big plus here is that everything came out super fast.\n\nThe cucumber salad was a solid traditional chinese styled cucumber salad. With vinegar cucumber, soy sauce, it is a crisp and delicious appetizer. \nThe spicy numbing beef tendon was a bit disappointing. The portion size was very good, but the taste was very generic. The chili oil itself was pretty standard, and the tendon was a bit boring.\nThe Szechuan style pork belly was very delicious. It was soft where it would melt in your mouth, and there was a surprisingly good amount! I thought when the menu said Szechuan styled it would be spicy, but it was not spicy at all and had a nice savory taste.\nThe Chong Qing Xiao Mian itself was good. Not great, but good. The broth it was in tasted exactly as it looked like, the szechuan numbing sauce but very watered down. The broth being watered down allowed the noodles for faster consumption. The portion size of this was also crazy, there was a ton of noodles, it's very deceiving!\nThe Ginger Duck Noodle Soup was simply the Chong Qing Xiao Mian with ginger duck on top. The ginger duck was gingery and tasty, but I personally got a bit too many boney pieces(so not much meat). Having a bit more meat definitely added a lot to the meal in my opinion.\n\nOverall I could recommend Chong Qing Xiao Mian to people who are looking to try southern Chinese food. The Chong Qing Xiao Mian isn't spicy to the point where it's difficult to eat, so people with a small spice tolerance should be able to enjoy it as well!", "author": "Anthony Y."}

I decided to come here with a friend to try it out based on Yelp reviews. \n\nThe restaurant sits on a busy street with numerous Asian eateries, many offering the same fare. We came in on a Friday afternoon at 1.30pm. The space is small and busy but we were seated within 5 minutes. We each received a menu which is uniquely printed on a both sides of a single wooden board. Many of their popular items had accompanying photos which was helpful. There are a lot of appetizers! We were brought water within minutes of sitting down and the very hardworking and busy server got to us for orders within 10 minutes of being seated. \n\nTo start, we got the pickled cucumbers, tea eggs and bbq lamb ribs. The cucumber salad was delicious, it not overly sour with hints of fish sauce and sesame oil for umami. I've only had tea eggs a couple of times before but the ones we got were the best. The tea, soy sauce and (I believe) anise and cinnamon fragrances permeated deep through to the yolk. The hard-boiled egg was not overcooked and the yolk although fully cooked was still moist. \n\nNow, the BBQ Lamb ribs.....they were mouth wateringly amazing delicacies! Meat from lamb ribs ends were simply seasoned and roasted. Each piece had a crisp exterior, a thin layer of melting fat, and a thin sliver of gamey meat. \n\nOn to the entree, I got the Ginger duck Noodle soup. First, it was a very large bowl of steaming hot noodles in a spicy broth with large pieces of duck and cabbage, topped with sesame seeds  (You can request mild, medium or hot). The noodles had the perfect chew, and importantly, maintained their texture in the hot broth throughout the next 20 minutes that it took us to devour our large meal! The duck offered in the soup was well seasoned were a great \"side\" to the noodles which was the star of the dish! \n\nA great find! Satisfyingly delicious food, fast service, gray prices! I'm a fan and I can't wait to go back again!\n\n************************\nAddendum: It was so good after our first visit that my friend and I went back the next day. This time, we got the lamb skewers for appetizers, along with the cucumber salad and scallion pancakes. \nThe lamb skewers were styled like Singaporean satay (minus the peanut sauce), with small alternating pieces of meat and fat. It had great flavor, albeit requiring a little more chewing to break through it. \nI initially expected the scallion pancakes to be similar to ones I've had at korean restaurants. But I was wrong! Imagine a south indian roti prata but with scallions in it. That was exactly how it was for me, thin with flaky, crispy layers. \nFor entrees, I got the pork Spare Rib noodle soup. The broth was clear and not spicy at all. The bowl was made up of the same amazing noodles as we had the day before, but the bowl was also filled with pork ribs and neck bones!

But in this case, it does not. The flavor is mild. Sure I feel it somewhat spicy but it's not those kind of delicious-spicy. Besides, I found there are too much noodle in the bowl. I am kind of a meat-person, so I would like more meat in the bowl. Or even more vegetable in the bowl would make me happy. But there is just too much noodle in it and it takes over the entire bowl.\nOverall, I didn't really enjoy what I ordered. But I will still give it a try next time and try to order something else. I have been to the other two branches of this store (one in SF, one in Fremont) and they all tasted good.", "author": "Yanzhong L."}

Gwai lo, be careful:  it is spicy.

When we first went there, my wife got a sour type noodle soup.  She tried mine and over the meal, she kept dipping into my soup bowl and less of hers (hence the 2nd trip!).  The soup is so nicely flavored that I actually ate more of the soup before I realized I was orphaning the noodles.  The pig intestines were delicious as well.  They were not anemic by any sense and were boiled quite nicely.  Succulent would be a good description.  \n\nWe noticed too that many other people around us were ordering this specific dish.

The tan tan noodles are the most common thing to get here which is basically a noodle soup with a spicy oily mala broth. The noodles are chewy and plentiful and come with ground meat and cut up cabbage. My personal favorite is the noodles with peas and meat sauce which is very similar to the tan tan noodles but with peas added to the meat mixture. Both broths are identical and you get about the same amount of soup and cabbage. The flavor of the broth is pretty intense which is a treat if you're into that mala flavor. The mala flavor isn't as much spicy as it is a mild mouth feel of your tongue going slightly numb but not enough that Ye painful or you can't taste the food.\n\nI highly suggest getting an appetizer or two especially if you're with others. The tendon is a popular appetizer that comes in thin slices of beef tendon drenched in chili oil. Despite the heavy oil, it's really not spicy and has a delicate flavor to it. The cumin lamb is also incredible and I highly suggest this if you can only order one appetizer. These lamb skewers have a nice toasted cumin flavor are are super tender. The flavor is intense and a must have for anyone that likes lamb or cumin.\n\nThere's also non spicy options for those looking for a less adventurous meal.

It was actually really tasty. I got the Spicy Beef Bowl and my lady got the Tan Tan Bowl. The Tan Tan was a tab bit spicier than the one I got. Both bowls are actually really huge. The noodles in the Tan Tan soaked up ALL the broth. I've never seen that before. My broth was still there till I was done. The Beef in the Bowl I got was super soft. Really delicious. Both bowls were. We also got the sweet and sour pork. The meet was kinda rough. Not soft at all. I wish I got a bowl of rice to go with it. Service was ok. Not bad but not that great either.

The cold noodles were the least spicy of the 3 dishes, with a slightly sweet flavor, and acidic vinegar tang. The noodles were cooked to the right firmness, and retained a slightly firm texture, but were not really al dente. The beef tendon was drenched in chili oil and dried chilis. As such, it was very spicy, but delicious. The texture was gelatinous and chewy. \nThe tan tan noodles were my favourite. The minced pork was peppery, while the soup was oily and spicy.

The Tan Tan Noodles were slightly more vinegar-y and included ground pork, but otherwise they were nearly identical dishes....and neither was very spicy.  \n\nThe steamed greens - i.e. steamed pea shoots in some kind of \"sauce\" - were pretty bland.\n\nThe cucumber salad, however, was amazing.

We got the cucumber salad as well, which honestly wasn't my favorite as the pieces are cut enormously which made them a little bit difficult to eat. They were SUPER garlicky too, which I actually loved. We also tried the sweet and sour spare ribs (delicious, super tender and sweet), as well as their steamed vegetable, which happened to be bok choy.\n\nAs Kimberly S notes in her review, the food was excellent, and the service was just about what you'd expect.

It stood in stark contrast with the rest of the stores on Kearny, even know, I think it has a unique look that I'm afraid puts the other stores to shame. I came here numerous times since it opened, and have tried most of the items on the menu that enticed me. There's almost always a line outside whenever I walk by, which is probably a testament to the quality of the food here in comparison to other places in Chinatown. \n\nOn a recent Sunday evening, I came here with a friend because we're craving for Sichuan cuisine. When we walked in, there was a small line, which was not too bad at all considering it was a Sunday evening. Eventually, we got seated and deliberated over what to order, since we already had most of the dishes here. I wanted something spicy, so I got the Tan Tan Noodle. We also decided to get the Sichuan Style Steamed Pork Belly with Pickled Mustard as an appetizer, since we never had it before. It seems that since the last time I've been here, they've added the plum juice to the menu. Intrigued, I decided to order the plum juice as well. \n\nFirst, the waitress served us the pork belly and my plum juice. When I got a small taste of the pork belly, I was really surprised. It was really tender and the meat just seems to melt when in your mouth upon contact. Honestly, I think it was better than the other appetizers that I've had here. There were some small mushrooms or bamboo shoots on the bottom of the bowl, and they went nicely with the pork belly. The plum juice was good, I never had plum juice before so I can only say that it was sweet and it's in line with what I expected when I ordered the drink. At last, our respective main dishes came out, and I dived into the dish. To my slight dissapointment, they didn't give me as much broth for the Tan Tan noodle as I'd like since the broth only went halfway up the bowl. Nonetheless, I went for the noodles and the meat. The ground pork was finely minced and went great with the noodles and the cabbage. Since there wasn't much broth, I had to eat quickly before the noodles soaked up the broth. The dish started off as not really spicy, but as you dig deeper toward the bottom of the dish, it gets progressively spicier. \n\nAll in all, I was very satisfied with my meal here, similar to my past visits. I'm certainly a fan of this place, and I keep coming back here because this is only of the few great places to get Sichuanese food in Chinatown, and I really enjoy the variety of dishes here, spicy and non-spicy.

I didn't think there would be a wait but at 7:15pm on Friday, the line looked intimidating. We grabbed some drinks around the corner and when we came back at 8:00pm, they had already called my name and skipped over us. But by then, there was only one group ahead of us.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were extremely hungry. We tried Dan Dan Mian, Chong Qing Hot Numbing Spicy Noodle, Sweet & Sour Spare Ribs, and BBQ Lamb Skewers. The best dish, by far, was the Dan Dan Mian. You have no idea how sad I have been in the past two years because I have not had good Dan Dan Mian since I left LA. This discovery is a game changer. The Chong Qing Hot Numbing Spicy Noodle is an excellent vegetarian choice but I would have preferred a bit more numbing sensation. My date wanted the Spare Ribs and they were pretty decent for $4.95, but I probably wouldn't get them again. Finally, the Lamb Skewers were meaty and delicious; I could have used just a tad more cumin.\n\nOverall, the meal was a resounding 5 star experience when graded on the Bay Area curve.

That sounds totally weird considering the large population of Chinese in just the metropolitan city alone. \n\n- Spicy Wontons - came in a spicy \"soup\" rather than the picture they display. It was fine but felt like it had-  very little meat.\n- Tan Tan Noodles - This tasted like a regular bowl of noodles with some spicy sauce and it's my understanding that there should be a peanut element with Tan Tan or Dan Dan noodle. There was barely any ground pork in the dish. \n- Spicy Beef Tendon - not bad although I like my tendon sliced just a tad thinner.\n- Braised Pork Belly - this was good albeit a bit salty and a small portion.\n\nAmbiance: We had to eat at a communal table and even though we were at the edge closest to the kitchen it was a little claustrophobic being in that small place packed with tables. \n\nService: the service was quick and efficient.\n\nI left the restaurant feeling rather unsatisfied and perhaps it was the lack of protein because it wasn't very much protein when you looked at all the dishes combined.", "author": "Viyada S."}

Load of spicy goodness.  Savory ground pork.  This dish is awesome.  It's got a little broth, but it's far from being a soup.  The spicy factor seemed mostly derived from the sichuan peppercorn instead of tons of chili powder, so it's got that pleasant peppery perfume aroma to it.\n\nBeanjello in Red Chili Sauce: Just wasn't feeling this one.  The chili sauce was fine; it even had an umami tone to it.  But the beanjello was a little bit too jello-like for my tastes.

Being only a party of 2, we didn't wait long (less than 10 min?) for a small table, skipping the bigger parties still waiting outside. \n\nWe ordered the Chongqing Hot Numbing Spicy Noodle, the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and the BBQ Lamb Ribs. The noodles were on point: delicious, plentiful, chewy, and had just the right thickness. Did not care for the oversized, thick Napa cabbage leaves in both soup dishes (difficult to eat) nor the really thick layer of floating chili oil and countless Schezuan pepper flakes in the soup (one prev reviewer was right - you really can't drink the soup). Also, the picture on the menu for the Hot Numbing noodles showed thin greens (not the thick bottom ends we got), and for the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup showed much thicker, flat noodles. We asked if they got the type of noodles wrong for the 2nd dish. The answer was, \"there is only one [type of] noodle [served].\" The beef cuts in this soup dish was very tender but had a very plain stew flavor. Overall, the spiciness level was rather moderate (nowhere near hot numbing) for either dishes, although my tolerance level is rather high. The BBQ lamb rib dish was a disappointment for the $15.95 price. It was visually a very small portion; the ribs were also quite small with a lot of fat on them; and they were seasoned (rather saltily) on only one side.\n\nOverall, the only reason we would return is for the tasty noodles and possibly to try the other dishes. This place is a pleasant surprise for the area, since most of what you'll get around there are dumplings, dim sum or just plain boring noodle dishes.", "author": "DN S."}

Although they sometimes have a line at the door, it moves rather quickly and they are pretty efficient about getting people in and out.  Orders do not take too long to come out and there's a pretty good turnaround of tables.\n\nThe menu is primarily made up of noodle soups, all of which are delicious.  I love the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup which has a nice ma la flavor.  Ma La is the Szechuan peppercorn which has a numbing sensation.  It can be a little bit strange for someone to taste for the first time, but I think they do a pretty good job of balancing this flavor so that it is not overwhelming.  The spice is perfect on a cold and windy SF day!  My other fave is the Braised Spare Ribs Noodle Soup (Pai Gu Mian).  The broth is SO delicious--clearly a slow boiled bone broth with rich and deep flavor and they are super generous on the portion of meat.  This is like the soup I crave for when I am sick in bed.  Amazing, and it's not spicy for those of you that can't handle the heat!  Portions for the noodle soups are large and the noodles are nice and fresh and chewy.  \n\nFor sides, I would recommend the:\n- Cucumber Salad - good portion and a nice way to balance out the heat from the soups\n- Green Onion Pancake - nice and crispy\n- BBQ Lamb Skewer - nice cumin flavor and very tender lamb meat\n\nMy problem whenever I visit is that we over order.

Here's what my wife and I took from our experience at Chong Qing Xiao Mian.\n\nPros:\nThe food was fresh and the restaurant was also pretty clean! \n\nFood and experience:\nWe ordered the Green onion pancakes, \nTan tan noodles, Dumplings and spare rib ends. Dumplings were awesome and so were the green onion pancakes. The noodles were OK, but not very flavorful. Ribs were way too tough. \n\nThe only other comment I'd make is that our waitress couldn't guide us in the right direction. For someone inexperienced in the authentic Chinese food game it's difficult to gauge what you should order. This isn't a place you order fried rice in ppl (they actually don't have, I checked). There's definitely a language barrier.. So all in all, if I was a Chinese food connoisseur, I might have enjoyed this place more. If you're a beginner, you might spend some money experimenting with food you don't end up liking.", "author": "Maria R."}

We got the tan tan noodle and beef with pickled greens. Appetizer, we got lamb skewer and braise pork belly. The pork belly is a no. It is tender but salty. Maybe better with rice. The skewer is good season with cumin and fennel seed. It's flavor does kick a punch but I like it. The two noodle bowl is most popular but I like the beef with picked greens better. Maybe because it has a sour flavor to it which I like. The best part is the noodles. Hand made nice and firm plus they give you a large amount of noodles. I really liked it. Thanks to Roy, he helped me with half of my noodles or else for sure I wouldn't be able to finish it. Even than I'm so stuffed. Should have given him 3/4 of my noodles lol. 4 star from me.

Normally, I like ramen noodles, thick egg noodles, or thick hand pulled noodles...basically the ones that are more likely to yield al dente results.  But given the good reviews, I just had to visit and try for myself.\n\nI told the waitress that we were comfortable with spicy and wanted her recommendation.  She pointed to the house noodles (the spicy one without meat).  Since I generally like some meat with my noodles, I also got an order of the chicken appetizer (kou shui ji).  The chicken appetizer was solid, and I'd recommend it.  I thought the broth for the noodle dish was pretty good, too.  I was unsure what to expect...perhaps some animal broth with a lot of chili oil.  But I think I detected the flavor of pickled mustard, too.  However, it contained all the flavor of the dish.  If you ate the noodle by itself without taking in a mouthful of broth, it was pretty lackluster.  The fact that the noodles were slightly overcooked did not help matters.\n\nIf I return, I would order the dry noodles...First they would more likely be al dente and secondly, maybe the noodles would be flavored better.", "author": "Lan N."}

About a week later, I studied the menu and decided to try their Spicy Beef noodle soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G5KR7WJhsJrM4X7WvO0zHg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) for $9.95.  The picture on the menu (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zVMogYg1hg9b9iePEoDpQA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) was a bit different as the ingredients were a bit different and actually for the better.  The menu photo shows a thicker udon like noodle with tender bok choy.  What I actually ate had water spinach (ong choy) and large cubes of daikon (radishes) which added to the flavor and textures in the bowl.  I appreciated that it wasn't fully \"authentic\" as described in its Chinese name of numbing spicy.  My mouth tasted the different flavor in the bowl which made it that much more interesting.  The beef chunks were melt-in-mouth soft and flavored from its braising process.  The noodles were thinner, more in line with saimin noodles found in Hawaii, more of a Cantonese style noodle type.\nThe menu doesn't have a large variety of items if you're coming for a family style diner, but, for just a one plate meal, there is a good selection both spicy and non-spicy.  For those who seek authentic numbing spice far, this probably doesn't fit your bill.  For me, being able to taste the food is more important especially if they leave me smiling.\nWill be back to have this again on a cool San Francisco day.  Also, hope to try some of the other available noodles.  Given the prices of ramen these days, this is definitely a good change of pace or warming bowl of noodles when in the area.", "author": "Mike C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-18", "description": "Chongqing Xiao Mian is the sixth effort by the ex-Z&Y pair that began by transforming The Pot Sticker into (now defunct) \"Ma La Yi Pin\" and later took over the venerable Uncle's Cafe (now Spicy King) down the street on Waverly Place. They also operate Spicy Queen in the Richmond, as well as outposts in San Mateo and Newark.  Unlike the other venues, Ma La Yi Pin #6, as its menu dubs it, is from the mian guan (noodle house) mold, focused on noodles and accompanying appetizers and side dishes As such, it is a more inviting place for people like me who fly solo and are just looking for noodles and a nosh without the guilt of occupying a space at a full-service restaurant promoting more elaborate and profitable dishes. In this respect, the Chinese mian guan is really the prototype of the ramen-ya.\n \nChongqing Xiao Mian was empty when I arrived at 2:00 PM on its opening day, though another couple of tables were filled while I was there. I pretended to study the brief menu, though I almost knew it by heart already, and wouldn't let myself order anything but the house's namesake dish, Chongqing xiao mian, to which I added an order of potstickers for protein. Based on a previous experience at another of the Wu-Du group's properties, I was poised to insist my spicy noodles come to me spicy, but the server had it covered: \"It's very spicy,\" she said, and I assured her that was the way I liked it.\n\nMy bowl of Chongqing Xiao Mian did not disappoint. A veritable mountain of extruded fine noodles sat in a pond of chili oil augmented with a number of ground condiments and spices including Sichuan peppercorns, and what appeared to be garlic shoots. It was honestly spicy, eye-watering, nose-running spicy but not so much as to mask a complex flavor profile. The noodles themselves were fresh and al dente, and there was such a quantity of them packed into the bowl that I felt like I had consumed a whole Mission burrito, so sated was I after my meal. This is a bowl I will return for (after vetting some of CQXM's other offering).\n\nAs for the potstickers, they were pretty generic in shape, size and flavor, but well cooked with nicely browned facets, and tasty. I'm not sure if they were made in house; I began by asking the server that question, and she initially replied she didn't think they had them today, then checked herself and consulted the chef, who assured her they did. In any event, they filled the bill, providing some needed protein (and unneeded carbohydrate!).\n\nLike some of the group's other branches, Chongqing Xiao Mian offers a whole range of regional noodle styles, including Guilin mi fen, Wuhan Hot Dry Noodles, liang fen, etc. along with other Sichuan classics. With such a range, one tends to be skeptical,  but since this branch is a noodle-focused enterprise I'm hopeful the chef knows what he's doing.", "author": "Gary S."}

The beef tendons were great, and probably the best part of the meal for us. Both bowls of noodles were sadly lacking in broth, by the end of the meal, the noodles had almost entirely absorbed any liquid in the bowls and the dishes resembled dry noodles instead of soup noodles. It was hard to distinguish any real difference in flavor between the noodles, with the tan tan noodles probably being a tad more flavorful.

And by spicy, I mean the numbing of your lips and the fresh minty feeling in your tongue kind of spicy. Exactly the way I like my food, so I was in love. I also took advantage of the black bean paste on the table because it added a nice touch to the noodles. \n\nThe only complaint I do have is that the soup was very very oily. It also did not have much of it so it felt more like a sauce than a soup. \n\nContrary to other reviews, I actually think they give very big portions here. I even had half the bowl leftover. The bowl was big and full of densely packed noodles, and I got 3 decently sized pieces of beef.

I've never personally tried numbing spice so I wasn't sure what to expect. I typically like spicy foods like hot cheetos, boiling crab, etc. but this spice is a whole other category. It makes your tongue feel numb and tingly- feels similar to if you get analgesic gel from the dentist. I, on the other hand prefer a more chili type of spice? Like spicy where I can still taste the flavors, and feel pain, but not numbness. \n\nI ordered the Dan Dan noodles and my boyfriend ordered the pickled mustard green noodle soup. We both asked for light/mild spicy. Unfortunately, the light spicy was still too unpleasant for us because we don't like the numbing spice feeling at all.  The soup also didn't have much richness or savoryness to balance the spice. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't say this is a bad place, I think it's great if you really are looking for Sichaun spice. It's just not my preference/taste.", "author": "Kathleen Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-28", "description": "I'm overwhelming sad to write this review. My family is from Sichuan and I grew up with the strong salty, spicy flavors my province is known for. When I first visited this shop, I was elated. The flavors of the spicy noodles were so close to the street flavors I missed in China and I didn't think I'd find noodles made to such authenticity in San Francisco. I forced my boyfriend to come here nearly every week since then and he became a convert. \n\nSo why the 3 stars? This establishment has changed so much. The past 3 times I've been here have left me disappointed. The once vibrant, numbing flavors of the noodles has turn into a generic salty slop of too many old chilies. I am a horrible Chinese cook. I know the taste of when I can't get the spiciness right and overcompensate by just lopping on more old chilies. I just didn't think I would have to experience that sort of neglect here. The flavors are not authentic anymore and this place has quickly become just another Sichuan(including Chong Qing) imitation restaurant. Probably why it's gotten such high reviews from people who have \"eaten noodles in Beijing\". \n\nIf you are like me and miss you family and the painfully wonderful \u5ddd\u83dc back home, I would suggest you try Z&Y instead. They're not the best but better than here now at least. Chong Qing Xiao Mian - I know there are always problems with adjusting flavors or quality to meet the demands of the crowd you've started to draw. I just wish you knew how much your food meant before to people like me who saw it as the first nostalgic glimpse of my culture.", "author": "Katherine F."}

Everyone's food looked good so I didn't mind waiting a bit to try it.  When we're seated, we get seated very tightly close to other people which was a little annoying at first but I understood that there was limited space.  It's just a pain when you don't have elbow space.  When we got our food, it looked great but it was pretty disappointing. Both noodles were pretty bland and tasted like it was just a mixture of oil and spices which it probably was. I liked it at the first bite since I thought it had a nice kick to it but the more I ate it the more overwhelming it became.  Also, I thought they were serving us tea but it turned out to be just hot water.\n\nNow, like I said before, I don't have another type of Chinese noodles to compare this to so maybe the noodles were made well and maybe just not my cup tea.

My favorite family-owned, family-run pho place used to be here. I was here a week before they got bought out. I'm upset that they no longer exist, and probably harbored some grudges towards this place for taking over... But I have to admit that they have good food. \n\nI came here on a super rainy Saturday night. Everyone here speaks Mandarin. We got a table for two and ordered the spicy beef tendon. Large amount of beef tendon, and very much worth the price. It was tender and spicy, but not too spicy. As we kept eating, we noticed that it got increasingly spicy but not to the point where it was unbearable. The tendons are marinated in a dark red spicy sauce with cloves. When you reach the end, be careful -- lots of cloves floating around and they're kind of bitter.\n\nI ordered the Dan Dan Mian. I've had dan dan mian in Beijing, the capital of spicy food (besides Sichuan). Dan dan mian in Beijing is 2USD, so seeing the price tag for this was exorbitant in comparison. The noodles are chewy and cooked really well. I can't tell if these are handmade, but I have a feeling that they're not. There wasn't enough pork, and they included three pieces of cabbage? lettuce? The dan dan mian I had in China had a LOT of soup. This had some soup, but not enough. It wasn't a bad dish; I just wish there was more meat and soup. It does get increasingly spicy as you eat, and tastes good the entire time you eat it. It's not numbing spice, but just enough that you get a kick. It was okay. \n\nI'm still sorely missing Great Saigon. (Does anybody know where they went? If they opened a restaurant at another location? Please let me know!) While I miss that place, I think that this place is still good. The beef tendon really made me give it four stars. The dan dan mian is just average, but I've also had the real thing. If you've never had dan dan mian, I would recommend coming here to try it. Their other noodle dishes also look fantastic.

The service was alright but it took a little while for the waitress to take our order.  After that, our two bowls of noodles arrived very very quickly.  We ordered Tan Tan Noodles and Spicy Beef Noodles; each bowl was $9.95 and packed with a dense amount of fresh noodles.\nThe Tan Tan Noodle is more of a saucy dish--topped with, I think, minced pork--rather than a soup since the peanuts add a rich thickness.  The Spicy Beef noodles had about six thick chunks of beef that fell apart in your mouth and two chunks of turnip.  The broth has a \"Taiwanese-esque\" taste to it and had a good amount of heat to make you sweat a little bit.  Both dishes are very authentic, hearty, and in bowls of noodles to get in Chinatown!", "author": "Ashley Y."}

It's even more impressive that this joint has Wuhan's Re Gan Mian (Hot Dry Noodle) on the menu. The noodle soups were not too spicy, which I guess, is tailored to the local SF palate, but if you ask them to spice it up, it'll come close to the authentic flavors of Sichuan and Chongqing. The side dishes are delicious as well, and perfect to share with a small group. But the portions make it easy for one person to finish a bowl of noodle soup and a side dish all by themselves!\n\nOnly complaint is they seem to be understaffed when it comes to seating people, but the food comes out fairly quickly.

This place was recommended to us by our Uber driver. He indicated that I should stay away from Chinatown for food and to try this place for authentic Chinese. The prices were very reasonable for the city (bonus) . I did not recognize the menu items here from other Chinese restaurants I've been to- there was nothing to compare. I like that concept. The things I did recognize were : pork, noodles and spicy. Unfortunately, the servers were very short tempered and rude and that's why we didn't give five stars. We were the only Caucasian people in the restaurant and totally touristy, maybe that was the reason? Overall, it didn't really matter I was able to overlook her poor attitude. The pork noodle dish that I ordered was incredibly flavored, something I've never tasted before and very hard to describe. It was definitely very salty and very spicy, which I liked very much. My son had a duck noodle dish which had lots of bones that he had to navigate through. That was a little difficult for him. He tasted my dish and said mine was better. When I asked the server what vegetables were in the dish she said \"Chinese vegetables\". I gave up in asking questions and took the leap. We wanted to try the short ribs because another table had those as an appetizer, they look so delicious. I was afraid we would have too much food. I would definitely recommend this place for an adventurous palate. If you are a traditional American food/American Chinese food type person and you're not adventurous I recommend staying away. The food experience we had outweighed the negativity given to us by the servers.", "author": "Amber S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-13", "description": "Pretty authentic spicy Chinese food that's large in portion and not overpriced. I went with two friends and we ordered just enough food for the three of us with only a little leftover. It's a small restaurant and when we went on Monday night, it was packed, but the turnover was fast-- it's definitely more of a get in, get out establishment. The sole waitress that night handed us menus as soon as we sat down, but we ended up going up to the counter to order because we saw other people doing the same. Not sure if this was because the waitress was swamped though...\n \nDine-In:\n\n- Chongqing Hot Numbing Spicy Noodle (\u91cd\u5e86\u5c0f\u9762) \nThis came to the table first and we devoured it in minutes. The spice builds and it was so good I dreamed about it and ordered it for lunch pickup today. \n\n- Beef in Pickled Mustard Green Noodle Soup (there are two, but we ordered the \u8001\u58c7\u9178\u83dc\u725b\u8089\u9762) \nMake sure to eat this as soon as it's served because the noodles will get soggy if they sit in the broth for too long.  The soup base was tasty, but you didn't really taste or see the pickled mustard, save for the tiny little fragments here and there.  They gave around 4 pieces of beef and a couple of bok choy slices.\n\n- Appetizers: Couple's Delight (\u592b\u59bb\u80ba\u7247), Slice Pork Belly w/ Spicy Garlic Sauce (\u849c\u6ce5\u767d\u8089), Chicken Feet w/ Pickled Pepper (\u6ce1\u6912\u51e4\u722a) \nThese weren't too spicy, probably 1.5/5 (except for the chicken feet, which is just sour/tart and not spicy at all).  The Couple's Delight was great; standard and good texture.  The pork belly was a bit too sweet for my liking but delicious nonetheless. The chicken feet was a hit with my friends (I'm not as big a fan of sour dishes) and the texture was perfect.\n\nDrinks:\nThe Ice Soy Milk actually comes by the glass and not by cans as the menu states. I think the waitress said the soy milk and plum juice actually come in big bottles and they just pour out glasses for you. They're not housemade sadly. The tap water comes with a lemon slice though!\n\nTakeout:\nI called in an order of 2 noodles on a Wednesday and they said to come by in 15 minutes. When I got there at around 11:30, only 2 tables were occupied (so if you're craving Chinese for lunch, it's a good time to go!) I timed it so there was minimal wait time, but my Chong Qing Noodles got a little soggy anyway. These came in a no-ventilation hole plastic container with sauce on the bottom and noodles on top. It still hit the spot, but I have to note that it was less spicy than our dine-in experience.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pork Bone Broth Noodle Soup (\u9aa8\u6c64\u5c0f\u9762), which was very flavorful and wasn't spicy at all.  This came with the noodle and soup separate. They don't give much soup for takeout, so it might be better to eat in if you plan on drinking the soup as soup.", "author": "Lily D."}

While no room to wait for seating, our first time was not a good one. Had no idea there was a clipboard to sign our name for us to be seated, we were the 2nd party to be seated. Another party came after us and because they spoke the same language as the waitress, guess the waitress had asked her how many in her party and told them that they had a table ready. The lady politely said in English, \"no that's okay they were here before us\" (pointing at us; 2 babies 2 adults also a party of 4). Then the waitress said to the lady\"are you sure??\" Like as though she would seat them first anyway. Mind you, that same waitress watched us come in the door earlier. Not a fan of favoritism, luckily there are some good standing people that do the right thing. Besides the drama, this is a great spicy noodle spot, flavors are good.", "author": "Kris L."}

We also ordered Fuqi Feipian and Koushuiji. All of them are greasy and full of chilly oil. It's not too spicy though I'm just not a big fan of such kind of cuisine. Not very good for my stomach.

Let's just say that their flavorings were the closest I've had to what they use in Chengdu. They are not shy with the five-spice and sichuan peppercorns, but do not overdo it to the point that your tongue is simply numb. And the cucumber salad (always one of my favorites was fantastic). They used plenty of green onion and cilantro, the latter of which you don't see too often in chinese cooking, and tons of garlic (AWESOME!).

Walking in, we were not greeted (mind you, the place is tiny and they were not busy), we had to ask for a table. Anyway, we sit down and are going through the menu, the ramen did look pretty appetizing so I'll give them that. I was kinda upset that they didn't have a chicken ramen so I opened for their dry noodles. It took our waitress about 15-20 mins just to take our order yet she was servicing the other 2 tables. Whatever. Food finally comes and our chicken dish we ordered was cold and disgusting... I'm not sure it was even safe to eat. So I didn't. The noodles were tasty which is partially the reason for the 2 stars instead of one. My mom ordered the vegetables (it was literally just spinach) and was very tasteless. My mom asked the waitress if they had a chili sauce and she takes the same bowl of chili oil to the back, brings it back to our table and tells her it's different (it wasn't).
