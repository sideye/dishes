We finally decided to pay a visit to a local korean restaurant during dinner hours on a Sunday night. We were seated as soon as we walked in, but I highly recommend arriving shortly after they open due to higher customer volume as it gets later. \n\nIt was a table for 2, but of course we had to order more than enough to satisfy my cravings. In addition to the complimentary shrimp chips and starters, we ordered steamed egg, corn cheese, spicy fried chicken, stir fried chicken, and rabuki (dukbokki w/ ramen). Everything was well prepared and presented. The flavors were rich, and each entree was still sizzling as the waiter served it to us. \n\nTo top it off, each table has a built in button to press when you need service!", "author": "Jamie P."}

Every bite had lots of octopus in it along with other little pieces of seafood. Their dipping sauce is also on point. Not too salty and pairs perfectly well. Must order!\n\nSteamed egg - Be careful this dish comes out piping hot! It's great for cutting all the salty food and delicious with rice or by itself. Eat it before it gets cold. \n\nKimchi Fried Rice - You can order this with a choice of spam or beef. We chose spam. This was my least favorite dish. It needs to be a little more dry and less salty. Generous portion though. \n\nWe started with a bottle of regular Soju then tried their lychee Soju cocktail. The cocktail comes in a tall skinny bottle and they make this in house.

Chicken Wings: Korean style spicy deep fried chicken wings ($12.95)\n19. Spicy Pig's Feet: Sliced pig's feet with spicy sauce, cabbage and onion ($23.95)\n21. Kimchi Fried Rice: Kimchi fried rice with beef and fried egg ($12.95)\n25. Stir Fried Calamari: Spicy saut\u00e9ed squid with vegetables ($11.95)\n\nI adore corn cheese, so their rendition was tasty. Good amount of cheese as well. For the wings, it seemed like we may have gotten the spicy KFC instead of the normal one? I was expecting the chicken to be naked, but it came with a somewhat spicy tangy sauce and peanuts. Regardless, they were nice and meaty. We decided to order the spicy pig's feet instead of the glazed one. The spicy sauce is just sambal, so I'd probably just stick with the normal soy version. That way, you can just add hot sauce if you want it. The order is a good portion, so you get a good amount of meat. The calamari was fine. Savory and chewy. I didn't eat much of the fried rice, but I though it was pretty standard.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is not the fault of the restaurant, but because our dasher was so late, everything was lukewarm / cold. (I think she was making other pickups and deliveries after picking up our food as she went all the way to the Mission / Potrero Hill area for no reason.) Also, she said the restaurant didn't pack our food well, so a lot of stuff leaked while in the bag. We ended up complaining to DoorDash and they resolved it, but I think the food suffered because of our delivery lady.\n\nOverall, decent spot to get your Korean snack food on.", "author": "Elena N."}

Don't come here for food, maybe come here if you want soju.\n\nService is not great. Food is not great. I had the kimchi stew with pork and tofu. Lots of firm tofu (not the smooth kind that should be used), and tiny bits of pork here and there. I don't even know why I ordered this. Oh, that's right. I wanted some tofu soup and the only tofu soup they had comes with beef and seafood, which I was not in the mood for. So I went for the kimchi stew, and I so regretted it. The banchan also sucks. There's only 4 tiny servings of sides, shared between me and my friend. Can I ask why isn't there kimchi? If you have kimchi stew. . . why don't you serve kimchi with banchan? Or is it because I already have kimchi in my stew? I don't know. \n\nIf anything, at least I enjoyed the Pineapple Soju.

The corn cheese was super good and not too oily like some places might be.  I'm not too sure if every table has one but when we tried to get a server's attention they kindly told us the best way to get their attention is to ring the bell and they will come to us.

I wasn't in the mood for shabu that night (Shabu House is a few doors down) but was craving Korean comfort food. Between my friend and I we shared:\n- the sweet/spicy fried chicken (yang nyeom style)\n- kimchi seafood pancake\n- beef dolsot bibimbap\n- carafe of yogurt soju (covers about 12 shots or so) - server with a side of shrimp chips (yum!)\n\nFood was typical of what you'd find at a Korean bar-food style restaurant (like Toyose or OB chicken). The flavors were tasty and on point. I am a big fan of yang nyeom style fried chicken - most places make it on the sweeter side such that there isn't so much spice. However, the yang nyeom chicken here had a bigger spicy kick than other places I've been to. Definitely was a pleasant surprise! Also, typical of Korean restaurants, you are given some banchan side dishes. We received four side dishes including bean sprouts, broccoli, spicy cucumber, and potato (they were all so so good!)\n\nThe total bill came out around 60$ for the two of us, which is somewhat pricey since we didn't order that much food. But hey, Korean food tends to be on the pricier side anyways. Despite the more expensive price tag, we were full after eating and even had enough food for leftovers for the next day! \n\nThere aren't many Korean options in the city (especially in the Sunset/Parkside areas), so it's definitely great to have Wang Dae Bak as another addition to SF's Korean food scene.

The service was lacking despite having a call button on the tables to grab a waiter's attention. The banchans were also lacking as they only provide four kinds with only the cucumber one that made me want more. The price is quite high for some Korean food, especially the meats. We ordered the Bulgogi ($18) and Korean Miso Stew ($14) for two. The bulgogi was okay and standard at best. What saved this place for me was the Korean miso stew. It comes in a huge pot that's enough for two and filled with so many yummy goodies like shrimp, mussels, clams, fishcake, enoki, cucumbers, cabbage, etc. \n\nI'm a bit indifferent about this spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-21", "description": "My new latenight hangout spot! I used to be a regular patron of Toyose, but the dining experience there is not quite ideal to say the least, since being in a converted garage and all, it is super cramped and noisy. Also, their food tends to be quite heavy and greasy.\n\nWang Dae Bak, on the other hand, is much more comfortable, with spacious seating and ambient mood lighting. In addition, it is not excessively loud, has ample parking along Ocean Ave., and during the times I have patronized - usually around 10:30 to midnight on various weeknights and weekends - there is never a line.\n\nHere is a quick rundown:\n\nService:  B-\nIt is sometimes hard to get their attention, since there is often only one waitress covering the entire restaurant, but once you are able to place your order, everything comes out quickly. I usually try to flag them down, but as with many Korean restaurants, there is that \"doorbell\" type button accessible from the table. The waitresses (I have only seen females, no male servers) are relatively polite, but not exactly chatty, so it is difficult to strike up a conversation with them.\n\nFood:  B\nMany of the meat items such as bulgogi and spicy pork are on par with what you'd find elsewhere. I wouldn't say they are amazing, but are still plenty delectable. The same can be said for the dolsot bibimbap, omelette, fried rice, and rice cakes.\n\nHowever, the true must have items here are undoubtedly the casseroles. Unlike at many other Korean restaurants (I'm looking at you, Toyose), Wang Dae Bak's version is not overly fattening. As a matter of fact, you can even drink some of the broth without fear of collapsing face first into the pot of cardiac arrest.\n\nAtmosphere:  A-\nThe dimmed, ambient lighting with accompanying K-pop jams is typical of many Korean joints, but the music and voice reverberation isn't excessively loud, so you are actually able to carry a conversation with your group. Tables along the walls are partitioned off for privacy, but legroom and table space are abundant. The middle tables are open, and are better suited for larger parties. As mentioned, it has never been packed to the rafters, although never completely dead either.\n\nParking:  A-\nThere is always plenty of free parking along Ocean after 6 pm. The neighborhood is very quiet and generally safe at night, but still do take precaution when entering and exiting onto the street, and as always, remember to lock up your valuables!\n\nOverall:  B+\nWhile Korean food in SF isn't known to be spectacular, Wang Dae Bak is easily one of the better of the lot. Since it is open until 2 am every night except Sunday (midnight), it is another great option for night owls in an area that is surprisingly lacking in this department.", "author": "Eric W."}

These different areas of San Francsico can really be confusing. I'm just so glad to have friends living in different areas that I don't have to worry about doing research, but just being a follower and enjoying the many surprIses. We celebrated a birthday here on a Saturday night... and it was really fun!\n\nWe must have drank every flavor of Soju available in the menu. Strawberry, Cucumber, Peach, regular (yuck), etc., and the bottled Grapefruit flavor was really good! Every flavor besides the bottled ones were a bit on the sweet side. If you have a sweet tooth,  then it shouldn't matter. Each flavor was mixed to the point. The soju content for the flavored ones mixed, is a bit lower by percentage. But, they're all creepers... meaning that you don't taste the alcohol since it's camaflouged by the flavor, that it'll hit you within a half a hour. Lol. For some reason, as much as I hate soju in a bottle that I liked the grapefruit one the best. This flavor cannot be freshly mixed. It's not as sweet and the grapefruit flavor is very suttle. Friends remembered that grapefruit is my favorite, so guess how many bottles we had?! Yikes! Thank God I didn't drive.\n\nThe food here is so good. We had the fried chicken wings,  seafoood pancakes, the military ramen noodles (Budae Jjigae),  and the rice cakes (Dok Bukkae). It was all delicious! My favorite was the military noodles as It was spicy and flavorful. Lots of spicy soup and vegetables. The rice cakes was a bit on the sweet side and spicy... so my soju acted a the neutralizer. The Fried Chicken Wings was also spicy, a little too much batter, but is acceptable. And the seafood pancake was huge!  Probably around a half an inch thigh with lots of seafood inside. Yes, I do recommend all these dishes. The food is a bit on the rich side as in heavy carbs, but you should be fine enjoying your meal with beer and soju.\n\nA nice hidden gem.

I ordered their bibimbap and I wasn't a fan of it honestly, which is why they're getting a slightly lower star rating on here.\n\nThe other food was pretty good though. My friend ordered their rice cake soup dish and it was very tasty. The broth was oh so flavorful. Their kimchi pancake was pretty tasty too. \n\nThe drinks weren't very strong at all, but when drinking soju cocktails that's kind of a plus, cause otherwise the drinks get kinda nasty. None of that here. I liked their mango and peach soju cocktails.\n\nIn all, it's a pretty solid spot to grab a few drinks and eat some tasty Korean food.", "author": "Sean H."}

It's more of a place for drinks and friends gathering, not a dinner place tbh. Food is good, but just your average Korean that everything is in the spicy sauce. Not a lot of option considering that. Service is non-existent just as most of the Korean restaurant but that's why there's a bell I guess. If you can catch their attention, they are pretty friendly.

I bookmarked this place after it was highlighted in one of the weekly Yelp features for chicken wings. \n\nThe S.O and I came here on a Friday evening approx around 7:30. There was a wait, but not bad for a party of two. There menu included an array of Korean stews, casseroles ( Korean army soup hotpots), standard Korean bar appetizers (ie. cheese corn, Korean pankcake, chicken wings) and flavored Soju. \n\nWe ended up ordering the miso stew, regular chicken wings, and cheese corn. Dear god that was way too much food for two people. I was really impressed by all the toppings and fillings in the miso seafood soup. The broth was delectable and paired well with our fried chicken wings. Ordering a hot spicy soup would have made the meal too heavy. \n\nMoving onto the wings, we opted out of the spicy one and went with the standard. Overall I would say the seasoning in the batter was perfect. Not too salty, just the right amount of crunch and served with side of salad and pickled radish. The  plate wasn't too oily as well, so I really enjoyed it. \n\nThe cheese corn was gooey and melty as expected.  I would definitely return next time with a bigger crew to share the giant casserole spam soup and some round of soju bombs. \n\nI would say a great find and good alternative to some of the places in the inner and outer sunset.", "author": "Diane T."}

It features a menu that is comparable to Tonight Soju, Toyose, and others in the city.  They have a service button located at each table, which is awesome if you need any service.  We decided on ordering the spicy rice cake, as well as the spicy fried chicken wings.  However, I would soon have regrets after eating them.  \n\nThe dishes came out in an ample amount of time.  My only bother was that both dishes were overly sauced.  The rice cakes were drenched in such thick sauce; so much that I had to wipe the sauce off the food.  It was simply too salty.  The chicken wings had less sauce, but since we only ordered those two things, a combination of two saucy dishes, just did not sync well together.  \n\nAll in all, I might consider giving this place a second try.

On the other hand, this is the spot to hang out with friends over soju carafes and cheesy corn. The style is similar to Toyose, The Crew, and Cocobang, except much more spacious.\n\nPrices are little higher with most entrees ~$13, the BBQ meat ~$20, and the cheapest appetizer ~$6 (which are French fries). The location merits sufficient street parking, the place is nice with little booths and chalk graffiti, and the servers are very polite and efficient. There's even a little bell you can ring to call a server, just like attention button on airplanes!\n\nThe noms:\n(+) Seafood and scallion pancake: The highlight was the sweet and tangy sauce, which complemented the crispy seafood pancake well. The portion of seafood was sufficient, heavy on the squid which was quite chewy and tasted fishy\n(+) Japchae: Not too greasy, good mix of veggies and slices of egg omelette\n(+) Chicken wings: Too dry in my opinion, but will satisfy cravings\n(+) Beef tofu stew: Standard\n(+/-) Seafood spicy hot pot casserole: Large portions and variety of seafood and veggies, with udon for good measure. The concept of a giant Korean-style boiling hot pot is appealing in SF's frequently chilly weather, but the dish becomes tedious to finish because it lacks oomph. The broth tasted a little watered down and not spicy, which is surprising for a Korean place. Note that it comes with fish intestines, so if you're westernized and have a fear of organs like myself, I recommend requesting no fish intestines\n(-) Banchan: A modest assortment of banchan basics--broccoli, mashed potatoes, sprouts, and fish cakes\n\nThe verdict: I had thought of WDB as a go-to due to the availability of parking (a rare commodity in SF!), but Manna remains a much-preferred staple for the quality and price. For somewhere upbeat and with Kpop music videos, WBD is a good option, especially for groups.", "author": "Edna C."}

It tasted like actual strawberry squeezed juice rather than that Calpico taste that some places would serve me. \n\nFour stars for the soju and the ambiance of the place. This place feels much, much bigger than other similar spots like Toyose or Tonight. It seems more spacious and you can fit a few more parties. I came once when there was three birthday celebrations going on at the same time. The walls are also covered with chalk writing or drawings from past customers. Neat idea and makes this place stands out. It's now labelled as \"that place with the chalk drawings on the wall\". \n\nI find that the food here is average but decent. Since everything is overpriced, the only thing I would really recommend is the soju and the seafood & scallions pancake.

The parking isn't too bad, the ambiance is nice, and the set-up is super trendy. But the food.....was just not that great. \n\n-Banchan: All of the options were just really bland imo :( It did not include the options I'm typically used to. They also didn't have kimchi on the original set of barchan-- I asked for it afterwards and was a given a very tiny portion. Kind of weird that it wasn't included in the first place (Isn't kimchi the standard at Korean restaurants?)\n\n-Kimchi seafood pancake ($13.95): I love ordering seafood pancakes because they are usually jam-packed with seafood (specifically squid- I just love those tentacles!) However, I was very disappointed the one from Wang Dae Bak as it was jam-packed with veggies and had very minimal seafood. With every bite, I got a ton of onions, peppers, and carrots; It was so overwhelming that I had to pick some of it out to actually enjoy the pancake. The pancake was also kind of soggy whereas I'm used to more crispy/crunchy pancakes. \n\n-Spicy Korean fried chicken($12-$13?): The first few pieces were okay, but it just got really overwhelming with the peanuty/sweet & sour tasting sauce after a while. \n\n-Bulgogi ($15.95): A plain tasting bulgogi in a rather small portion  \n\nThe service and ambiance was nice hence the 3 stars, but I was just disappointed at the priciness for such lackluster food.

The restaurant is located in a quiet area, so parking is a breeze, as there's barely anything else around. The service was also very attentive and quick, and this makes for a great place to come with a group. Our group of seven was seated right away, as we came relatively early in the night, but by the time we left, the restaurant was quite busy and crowded.\n\nThe banchan that came on the table was uncomplicated and not particularly memorable--kimchi, bean sprouts, broccoli, and fish cake. For food, we started with the fried chicken wings, which were a pretty standard appetizer. We got the soft tofu soup, which was quite tasty and had lots of seafood. The kimchi fried rice (we got ours with spam) with a fried egg on top was done extremely well and was probably one of my favorite dishes; the japchae was surprisingly warming and comforting, and the seafood/kimchi pancake was hearty and delicious as well (though a tiny bit burnt). We also had the dolsot bibimbap with seafood, which was probably the spiciest bibimbap I've ever had (so much so that I could only have a bite, but my wife loved it!). The galbi on a stone plate was nice as well, but very overpriced at $25 for a medium-sized plate. Finally, we had the sea snail salad, a unique Korean salad with raw cabbage, scallions, and carrots (among other veggies), tossed in a spicy red chili sauce. Our group also got a whole pitcher of beer to share!\n\nOverall, this was a fantastic Korean restaurant with great dishes and service, and definitely a perfect place to come with a group.

As somewhat random as Wang Dae Bak may be for the neighborhood, it's perfect because it's so refreshingly different.  Along with Shabu House up the street, this sleepy stretch of Ocean is finally home to some tasty dining choices!\n\nTaking over the old Kamakura space, Wang Dae Bak is a late night, soju cocktail type of spot cut from the same cloth as Tonight and Toyose (as well as The Spot, though I've never been).  The food is particularly similar to the latter, which makes sense since Toyose's old chef now works here.  However, Wang Dae Bak's menu is a bit more extensive, given its wider selections of entrees (as opposed to just the typical \"bar bites\").\n\n-- BEEF KIMCHI FRIED RICE...$11.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wang-dae-bak-san-francisco-2#rv90lVsY7pem0De7NkW7bg)\nA must at Korean joints like this!  The fried rice was flavorful without being overly acidic or spicy from the kimchi.  Plus, the fried egg was still runny when we cut into it.  I just wish there was a little more meat in it, though that's true of a lot of things...\n\n-- CORN WITH MOZZARELLA CHEESE...$5.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wang-dae-bak-san-francisco-2#ZeNxApu1juxXxl7X-oZCZg)\nAnother must, as it goes so well with Kimchi Fried Rice (Deanna Y. can attest!).  Buttery corn topped with a layer of cheese.  Save for the lactose intolerant, who wouldn't love this?  It was a little buttery, perhaps, but delicious nonetheless!\n\n-- KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN WINGS...$11.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wang-dae-bak-san-francisco-2#ZjRuxn6-MYrHYNfM43hO1A)\nVery similar to Toyose's, though I remember theirs being a little better (had more kick).  Still, these were great - juicy meat covered with a crunchy, tasty batter.  Perfect with or without alcohol, though a little pricy for the portion size (~8 pieces?).\n\n-- ROYAL STIR FRIED RICE CAKE - Stir Fried Rice Cakes, Beef, Fishcakes, and Vegetables in a Sweet Soy Sauce...$12.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wang-dae-bak-san-francisco-2#9176JXNp0_9MPCLWYbRKww)\nNot what I intended on ordering (ddok bokki), but not bad either.  The taste was a little sweet between the sauce all of the fishcakes, but the beef was pretty tender and I liked how the rice noodles had the perfect bite/chewiness to them.\n\nWhile I can't say how they compare to The Spot, I'd rank Wang Dae Bak a shade behind Toyose and well ahead of Tonight.  There are a few menu items I want to come back for (like their casseroles/stews) and I'd definitely like to try their soju cocktails as well.

They capitalize on many downsides that other popular soju bars like Tonight and Toyose have: long waits, bad service, and limited parking.

They open at 6 and we were the first ones inside. The restaurant is clean and fairly spacious. \n\nWe were seated and immediately brought out water and we decided on kimchee fried rice, chicken wings and the seafood pancake. The food came out pretty fast and I was excited because I was super hungry. Everything tasted good especially the chicken wings. They were juicy, had a crunch to it and were very flavorful. The pancake is huge but it was also tasty. Kimchee fried rice was good too but we didn't finish it either because their portions are pretty big.\n\nOverall, I would come back here if I ever want Korean bar food.

Somebody, please get this girl a slice of humble pie BUT hey, I'm up for adoption! *raises hand*\n\nAnyhow, she was getting on my last nerve so I decided to walk around the block and noticed that Wang Dae Bak Soju House was finally opened in the old Kamakura space. We came back the next day for dinner which was their second day of their grand opening. The hours of operation listed on yelp is wrong (in addition to the restaurant name): they're open everyday from 6 pm - 2 am (kitchen closes at 1:30 am). \n\nWe came before 6 pm and a guy who I think was the owner was very apologetic. He brought a menu to us in the car while we waited which I thought was really nice.\n\nPerusing the menu, there was a good variety of items ranging from skewers, mandu (potstickers), fried chicken, jokbal (slices pig's feet), pajeon (pancake), bibimbap (mixed rice bowl), kimchi fried rice, bulgogi, soups, stews, hotpot, and udon. Everything is reasonably priced at less than $20 except for the hotpots which were $27.95 but can serve 2-3 people. Soju carafes are $11 (strawberry, peach, lemon, pineapple, yogurt, lychee, and cucumber). \n\nI recommend coming in a group of 4 or more so you can sample more of the menu. It was just the two of us so we were limited in what we could order. \n\nI heard that the former chef of Toyose (The \"Garage\") is in the kitchen, so the KFC was a must order. We started with the Naked KFC Wings ($11.95): http://bit.ly/1C4rSpv which was uber crunchy, tender, and moist. Great booze drinking food especially with the Cucumber Soju ($11): http://bit.ly/1xrQF8b that was stiff and refreshing. \n\nIf you like Chicken Gizzards ($8.95), these are a must order app: http://bit.ly/1xd3hQg. They were stir-fried with fragrant roasted garlic, onions, jalapeno, and topped with fried garlic. So good with the sesame oil dipping sauce and white rice!\n\nFor our main, we shared the Spicy Pork ($13.95): http://bit.ly/1LOiXjG. It was tender, smoky, garlicky, gingery, and spicy with a touch of sweetness. I wish they had kalbi on the menu because we would have ordered that too.\n\nMr. NSS wasn't feeling very well but he can't take the heat from soondubu so he ordered the Seafood Udon ($11.95): http://bit.ly/1xV4lDl. I didn't have any but he said, he liked it. Judging by the pic, I think it could of used a tad more seafood though. \n\nSince the food was very solid, we ordered Bulgogi ($15.95) and Japchae ($8.95 +$3 beef) to-go. Mr. NSS took the bulgogi to work so I didn't try it. The japchae (stir-fried sweet potato noodles) was nicely al-dente but needed more sugar. \n\nService was just as good as the food. The entire staff was super cheery and nice. There's a call button at every table but we only had to use it once because the staff was attentive. Our waitress, Gahjee (sp?) was a total sweetheart. She says, we were first customers and even walked us out and opened the door for us as we were exiting. Very nice touch. \n\nD\u00e9cor is sparse but you come to Korean restaurants to drank and eat so that doesn't matter. There's 9 four tops, 3 eight tops, and some counter seating. \n\nParking is plentiful and easy. \n\nNearby Tonight Soju bar has gone way downhill with their inconsistent food and non-existent service (waitresses with an attitude) on our last few visits (too lazy to write an update), so Wang Dae Bak Soju House is now going to be our go to spot!

It may have been the broth, which wasn't as thick as I've had. \n- Soft tofu stew: my friend had it and liked it.

The seating was comfortable, there are booths and tables are spaced out enough to provide privacy and allow you to talk with your mates at the table without yelling at each other. \n\nFood: The presentation of the food was good, large white places with food centered for contrast. The taste of the food were a little on the mild side in terms of spiciness (hot). Depending on your crave, this place might suit your taste. If you have friends who are less tolerable to spice food, this is the place to bring them. \n\nService: The servers were really nice and accommodating. The table that was open when we came in was situated by the door and was tad chilly. We said we preferred another seating if possible and we were approached by the server 2 minutes later when a table left, telling us that she will clean the table right away and transition us over if we would like. They servers to get fairly busy and gives out the sense that the place is short staffed when the late evening crowd comes in, HOWEVER, if you just quickly tell the what you need as they run by, they WILL get to the matter.\n\nOverall: I enjoyed the place for what it is and I will revisit, but I don't think I will be selective to whom I will bring depending on the taste buds of my friend, whether they like that heavier spiciness that are present in a lot of other Korean restaurants or whether they are into the lighter end of the Scoville scale. I would suggest going before 10 because the place was packed shortly after my food arrived and there was a queue when I was leaving the place.\n\nOrdered:\nKimchi Fried Rice with beef- Everyone enjoyed it, very flavorful\nTofu Soup - It was decent, I enjoyed it. Some people thinks it could use a tad more flavor\nGrilled Squid with butter - very aromatic; lots of ginger, garlic, and onion\nKorean Fried Chicken Wings - Didn't really stand out, but wasn't bad. The wings weren't dry.\nSoju Cocktails - I enjoyed them, they weren't overly sweet and you can still catch the hint of soju\n\nWhat I forgot to tried and was strongly recommended by my friend was the corn with mozzarella cheese.", "author": "Alan L."}

There is one server there that simply has to go!\n\nIt started out like this; we arrived around 7:00pm tonight, on a cold and rainy Wednesday to have a nice meal and to perhaps catch the Warriors game that was on. My girlfriend and I noticed that the restaurant was relatively empty, so before we were seated, we asked the server if it was possible to seat us somewhere close to the television. The young lady flat out told us no, and explained that  the table closest the door was the only one available for us in the restaurant. I must reiterate that this response was ridiculous in that the restaurant was more than half empty, and that being that tonight was a cold and rainy, the table she was offering us was the draftiest in the house. Instead of arguing with her, we decided to sit where she told us to, but unfortunately, it only got worse from there \n\nAs we began to look through the menu, two other patrons came in through the door about 5 minutes after us. No one had left the restaurant during this time, and when these ladies were seated, they were taken to a table that totally would've satisfied our request.

Between my girlfriend and I, we ordered 3 items, so by no means was our table covered with plates. But when this terrible excuse for a server came out with our final dish, she decided to put it directly in front of me, so close that had I not been paying attention, my elbow could have knocked the whole plate over. The young lady did not have the common courtesy to even attempt to rearrange the dishes, and simply left the plate where it was convenient for her to drop it. By this time I was absolutely fed up with this terrible service finally brought this situation to the restaurant's attention.\n\nThe other server on duty took care of the situation and told us that she would be sure to notify the ma\nNormally, this would be a place that I would love to go to for Korean food, but tonight's experience absolutely ruined it for me.

We ordered a large variety of dishes including galbi, kimchi fried rice, japchae, seafood pancake, korean fried chicken, and more. I found the food to overall be around average with the fried chicken being a bit dry and tasteless. One dish I did really enjoy however was their sea snail salad. The salad had a spicy chili paste dressing with cabbage and slices of fruit (apple?). I found the crisp and sweet fruit to go interestingly well with the spicy dressing and the rest of the salad.

Understandably, as it is firstly a soju bar than a traditional Korean restaurant meaning it's not a place you'd think to find the traditional ajumma or eemo in the back cooking. So this is an FYI to those who had more of a traditional Korean restaurant in mind, did a Yelp search in the area for \"Korean\" and results yielded Wang Dae Bak.\n\nWe walked in right at 6:05 and they were opened and ready to go. You are immediately served water and handed a menu. We watched the (embarrassingly) suggestive dancing of the K-pop girl bands playing in the background, wrote on their chalkboard walls while we browsed through their menu. \n\nI eyed the spicy rice cakes, then the omelette rice, then back to the spicy cakes with the steamed eggs but something steered me away from all that and I ended up ordering the veggie yaki udon. The banchans arrived (really, no kimchi?) and out came the dish looking rather different than what I expected. Seeing that it was \"yaki udon\" I thought it was more of a stir fried dry noodle/veggie dish. But it was served with very wet, slippery noodles sitting in a shallow pool of broth and lots of still crunchy broccolis, peppers, cauliflowers. Taste was rather bland and disappointing. Husband had the spicy pork dish which ended up causing him to sweat profusely and only ate about half the dish. He said it was \"alright\".

They had to seat us in what is normally a four-top table. Fine, we'll manage.\n\nFood is worthy of 4 stars.  Good flavor, good amount of spice, and decent quality.\n\nCroquettes were decent. May be good for kids.\nChicken wings are kind of boring. Nothing to them.\nCalamari is as disappointing as the wings. Breaded and deep fried with no seasoning.\nThe breaded/deep fried items are sub-par and all need their accompanied sauces. All totally bland without.\n\nFried chicken gizzards are great. They're not breaded, but stir fried with some basic veggies... garlic, onion, peppers... adding good flavor. I wish more places had this on the menu. These were excellent with the pepper sesame oil.\n\nThe mains were a huge step up from the apps.\nBulgogi was very good. Have heard this could be hit or miss...ours was a hit.\nSpicy Pork very good.  Wasn't overly spicy...but the burn builds nicely as you eat.\nJap chae was great.  We all kept going back to this dish, including my daughter. \n\nTofu Soup was ok.  Not bad, not great.  We ordered it mild for my daughter.  What's surprising was how much its blandness really came through.  Apparently the spice hides the lack of flavor.\n\nBanchan is non-existent.  They provide four items (very small servings) and no kimchi.\n\n$13 dollar \"pitcher\" of beer is a great value.\n\nRemember how I said earlier \"we'll manage\" with the four top table.  Well we were forced to, because service tanked the review to an overall 3 star rating.  It started out very well.  We ordered drinks and appetizer, then mains a couple minutes later.  The apps came out in a few minutes.  We were thinking the service was excellent...but then the mains came out almost immediately after the apps came out.  We had no place to put any of the food we ordered.  We combined plates all over the table and they just filled any space with more food. I wasn't mad they slammed us with everything at once. We managed...though we shouldn't have had to...but then what pissed me off was when they added a 20% tip to our bill.  Seriously, for 4 adults and a child and their service miss-management.  They would have gotten at least a 20% tip anyway...but to include it without warning...not cool...total BS.\n\nSkip the deep fried appetizers... go stir-fried and the entrees.", "author": "Zoran L."}

Crispy calamari was nice large pieces of squid fried in tempura-like batter with tempura sauce; love the size and the batter, the sauce could be thicker so the flavor would be there. The bulgolgi was alright, but could be better; plenty of meat that needs to be dipped in the sauce before eating or it is bland.

The service is a bit slow, with the English being a bit limited, so the explanations of items nonexistent. \n\nThe food was only okay, but a little expensive. I always get the spicy rice cake (dukbokki) at Toyose and add potstickers and ramen for just a few more dollars, here, it would cost an additional $7 to add!

Cheese corn was okay, but i mean then again, its like HOW can you mess up cheese corn right? Pretty much, food was ew, and won't be back anytime soon.", "author": "Amy Y."}

Walked in on a Friday night, and no wait for a party of 4, but the whole restaurant filled up as the night went on. The menu itself reminds me of Toyose, even had the bell at the booth for any needs we had. \n\nStarted off with a carafe of cucumber soju. It was different since I'm used to the fruity and more sweeter sojus, but this one was light and refreshing. Onto the food:\n- Fried chicken wings: I thought they were a little dry and over fried. \n- Chicken gizzards: sooo good, very flavorful with the onions and garlic, came with a side of dipping sauces\n- seafood pancake: another goody, loaded with tons of seafood and my friend loved the sauce it came with, she used it to dip everything. My only gripe on this was that I wish it was slightly crunchier\n- sausage stew: a big pot of sausage, spam, napa, rice cakes, pork, tofu and ramen with soup, this big dish could easily feed 5, good flavor but can start to get a little salty towards the end \n- pigs feet: sliced, it had a soy sauce/braised flavor and came with 2 sauces, one which tasted like fermented soy paste and one spicy flavored sauce\n\nService was attentive, never felt rushed.

The bottle was kind of small, but with three people, we had about 3/4 shots each. The sausage stew was pretty good as well, it came with ramen, tofu, sausage, spam, rice cake, kimchi and some meat and wasn't too spicy which is good because I can't handle spicyness. The sausage stew was nothing special as well, typical sausage stew that I've had at other Korean places. The cheese corn wasn't that great, I've had better. It tasted very simply made, just literally cheese and corn, unlike other places I've had which tasted better and more flavorful. Since we ordered two items, it came with two rice bowls and some side dishes- broccoli, fish cake and potato salad. The fish cake and potato salad were pretty good! Overall, everything was just OK.

I've had better, there just wasn't really anything memorable about that dish. The kim chi fried rice was kind of a let down for me. Was a bit soggy and the kim chi had been fermented a bit too long since the fried rice was pretty sour. We asked for beef but they gave us spam in the fried rice... which wasn't the end of the world, just that we wanted something else since we had spam in our casserole already. Again, it may taste better with a different batch of kim chi and if it wasn't so soggy. Got the sausage casserole (hot dogs, spam, pork, kim chi, and the rice cakes). I don't think you can really mess up that dish... but it was comparable to other places where I have ordered the same dish. We shared the yogurt soju and the lychee soju. The lychee soju was probably my favorite and it has lychee bits inside of it. The yogurt soju wasn't bad either! The meal overall wasn't bad.

First of all the garlic fries really good. They were crispy and garlicky, but it's hard to eff this up. So kudos for them for not effing it up! The spicy fried chicken sauce was too..thick..

I enjoyed the flavors. The gizzards were also really good. Some gizzards really taste like you're eating something exotic and has weird after taste, but here at Wang Dae Bak, you couldn't even tell. It tasted just like dark chicken meat. I'd definitely order it again.\n\nThe service is really great. Our server was really nice. She gave us the pineapple soju on the house because we had to wait for our table (even though we had a reservation) and my half of the table had to wait longer for our food. But besides the free soju, she was really attentive the whole night and kept apologizing for our wait.\n\nAlso open late so it's a great place to hang out with your friends. It gets loud, but that just means everyone's having a good time.", "author": "Liezel D."}

There was also a time tonight's  soju was the go to place for people under the influence of alcohol or the munchies.\n\nI came to this location looking to see what took over for Kamera in addition to a new spot to try out close by to Shabu club. But let me be clear right off the bat.\n\nIf you are craving anything even resembling noodle soup or udon. Stay with Shabu Club because the flavor is much more tangibly there.\nDon't get me wrong, their udon here at WDB is warm hearted and light, but if you want a better wow factor for your taste buds, it would like SH more. But for what their udon is here, I would give them the nod.  (+1)\n\nTheir crispy tempura here is actually much lighter and crisper than most places you would find anywhere near japantown. Not just the battering but the fact that I don't  see a Russian River full of oil in the basket. That just looks more appealing without the oil and looks much healthier even though it's not really a calorie saver haha (+1)\n\nThey haven't developed a dessert menu yet which is lacking from many korean spots around the bay.\n\nThe servers and waitresses are very welcoming and friendly here. Which is more than what I could say for more expensive places outside of San Francisco (+1)\n\nExpect to expend 16-21 dollars per person on average.\nIn my opinion that's not too bad. Some places are 25 per entree....(+1)", "author": "Eric C."}

I'm not counting the ones in Daly City and Tonight Soju Bar is a decent distance away. Being 4.5 stars since opening, I've had high hopes for this place. Sad to say.. but this place started to shed stars as the night went on. \n\nSetting: My friends and I came to try Wang Dae Bak out on a Thursday night and it was empty when we arrived. This place was never busy but business picked up as the night went on. Even so, I don't think anyone had a wait. All the servers were extremely nice and very attentive. The restaurant looked very clean and well.. new as it should. All in all, I give the service and ambiance 5 stars. We ordered the following..\n\nFood:\n- Chicken Gizzards: MY FAVORITE DISH! Tons of garlic, flavor and overall goodness! Geeze, give me this with some kimchi and a bowl of rice and i'm set. HIGHLY recommended.\n- Bulgogi: Decent but not great. We ordered it with jalapenos on top which takes the flavor to a whole new level.\n- Kimchi Fried Rice x 2: Very above average Kimchi Fried Rice. The only other times I've had better KFR was in K-Town LA and K-Town San Jose (El Camino Real area).\n- Spicy KFC x 2: The first order was SO GOOD, we ordered a second one! Nuff said.\n- Naked KFC: Mehhhhh. Not even in the same league as Toyose Order this if you absolutely hate \"spicy\" food. Otherwise, don't even bother with this one. The Spicy KFC is the way to go. \n- Croquette: Average at best. It was nicely fried with nice consistency but lacked any sort of WOW factor. Take it or leave it. \n- Seafood and Kimchi Pancake: WORST pancake I've ever had. Extra soggy and slightly under cooked. Kimchi Pancake, easy to make. Seafood Pancake, easy to make. Kimchi AND Seafood? Too much liquid. NOT recommended! I don't even know if I can trust them to make a regular pancake. 0 stars.\n- Bibimbap: WORST Bibimbap I've ever had. No stone bowl, not enough meat, not enough rice, NOT GOOD ENOUGH. By the time you mix everything, the whole dish is cold! 0 stars. \n- Funyuns (?): They give complementary Funyuns? I'm not sure if that's a Korean thing but I'm on board!\n\nBeverages:\n- Cucumber Soju: Tasted like a liquid cucumber and not as sweet as I thought it'd be. Great for pictures but not so great to drink. \n- Yogurt Soju x 2: Delicious. Probably one of the best Yogurt Soju's around. Nice balance between strength and flavor.\n- Lychee Soju x 2: Another above average soju. Made with bits of lychee and well mixed. \n- Peach Soju: The girls I dined with thought it was good but I personally thought the Peach Soju as too sweet (but I am a whiskey drinker so maybe I'm biased).\n- Strawberry Soju: Similar to the Lychee Soju, the Strawberry Soju has bits of blended strawberries which adds a nice touch but this was nothing to write home about. \n\nI was very underwhelmed about this place. I actually think this place is 2.5 stars but I'm rounding up because it's still one of the better Korean joints in the area (compared to nothing). Give it a shot and try for yourself.", "author": "Chris W."}

The seafood pancake was probably the best thing out of everything that I have tried, but even then, it wasn't even close to being considered exceptional compared to the pancakes I have tried everywhere else.

I never had soju, I eat Korean food on occasion and I know that this area lacks diversity in food options. To celebrate a win/loss, a few birthdays and just hang out with friends, we found our way to Wang Dae Bak. The staff was filled with ladies. The place was extremely dim, fun k-pop music and well kept. The area was nice and if you have chalk you could write on the side of the walls too!\n\nWe ordered so much food. I must admit, I am picky so I didn't try a lot of things or I ate around stuff. For example, snail salad. SPICCCCCCY. I ate around the snail because I'm not built for stuff. But, it was great to see my friends enjoy it! They ate it like it was candy. We ordered it like it was family style so I just ate hella random things lol. Nothing sucked!\n\nThe staff. SO ADORABLE! We were able to take soju shots with them, the chef gave us a complimentary soju for it being such a celebration and we were adorably photobombed by one of the staff. They made our night there such a fun night! I love when I see people enjoy what they are doing when they could really be anywhere else. \n\nBathroom was well kept, even had lysol etc to keep the toilet fresh (THANK GOD). There are 2 separate bathrooms. One for men, one for women. I just hate going to an establishment with a terrible bathroom since I don't even like using public bathrooms, period. There is even an outlet in there. Lol, omg... im f'n reviewing a bathroom now. Yeah, let me stop.\n\n\nGreat place and hope to be back and I hope for this place to excel.

My first time coming here, my waitress was not that great. Honestly, it wasn't that busy but my party of 11 had to wait 20 minutes before we even got water or anyone to even come to our table to ask us how we are doing. I'm so disappointed. This is the second korean bar I've been to and y'all made me compare so hard. I don't like comparing places but I'm just so upset. What makes this whole experience even worst is that this happened on my birthday. Thanks for ruining it miss sassy. The reason why I'm really upset is because of the way the waitress handled my kfc order. I noticed that menu had korean fried wings and then a spicy korean fried wings. So when I seen that I assume that the korean fried wings was a not spicy sauce. When I ordered it, the waitress said SAUCE OR NO SAUCE. I said sauce and when I got my order, it was the spicy sauce on my wings. HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW THAT SAUCE IS SPICY. Don't you think if I wanted the spicy wings, I would of ordered SPICY KOREAN WINGS? The girl came back to talk really loud at me and say \"UHH EXCUSE YOU ORDERED NUMBER 14 BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANTED SAUCE\" I wasn't going to argue with especially because the restaurant was already kind of loud. All of friends were like damn that's rude af. I'm giving two stars because the food was really good. The wings I could pass because I know other places that are better. Skip on the wings, they aren't that good. The kimchi fried rice was really good! The mango soju was the best in my opinion! I also ordered the seafood pancake and I thought that was good too. Too bad the fries were so expensive because I thought they were really good. Skinny fries but you taste the potato in every bite.

This restaurant is fairly new and I believe it opened up only a few months ago. Since I am a huge fan of Korean food, I've been wanting to check this place out! So I made reservations for 6 just in case, even though it was a Sunday night. Parking was really easy to find and there were plenty (meter and residential parking). We got a nice private table by the corner near the entrance. The inside was very cute with a chalkboard theme going on and like most of the other Korean restaurants, each table has a button available for customers to press when they need service. The menu had a good amount of choices to pick from. We of course went with family style so we ordered a bunch of items to try: seafood pancake, chicken wings, spam and ramen stew, bulgogi, kimchi fried rice, and the rice cake. After ordering, food almost came out immediately! I was very impressed! However, they accidently gave us a order that we didn't order. It seemed that there was a misunderstanding but they corrected it right away. So A+ for them for the great customer service! \n\nOk onto the food. My favorite dish is probably the stew, kimchi fried rice, and the seafood pancake! Actually everything was pretty good. The only thing I was not a big fan of was the rice cake because it was a little too plain tasting for me. The portions were decent size since the price here is slightly higher than other Korean restaurants in the area such as Toyose or Tonights. For the stew we requested another pack of ramen, which was $3 extra, since one was not enough. Loll and the stew came on top of a portable stove to keep it hot and boiling. Yumm!

Spicy chicken wings - not as good as bonchon in Daly City.\n3. Kimchi fried rice - needs more meat and kimchi, but flavor was good!\n4. Spicy noodles with snails? (don't remember the name of this dish) - I really enjoy this dish, but I thought they could've done a better job. Flavor is there, but I wish they put more veggies. Also, I've never had it with udon noodles, so I thought that was interesting. \n5. Omelette fried rice - I don't really see how you can go wrong with this dish. Just fried veggies and rice topped with egg.\n6. Chicken gizzards - I thought it was good, but no one at my table seemed to enjoy it that much. I ordered them because of the reviews of Yelp, but it was just okay. Not bad though.\n7. Jokbal (pig's feet) - It was whatever.\n8. Seafood pancake - I personally didn't like it. I usually like my korean pancakes really crispy. If it was crispy, it probably wouldn't be at the bottom of my list. \n\nKeep in mind, this place automatically adds 20% gratuity to your bill for a party of 5 or more without warning. You have to look for it on your bill. They don't even tell you when they bring out the bill or even before they seat you. \n\nI would come back here for drinks and appetizers, but probably not for dinner.", "author": "Eunice I."}

The kitchen closes at 1:30am, so don't try showing up at 5 till 2 in your inebriated state. The service here is solid, and the food comes out super quickly, but be prepared for the loud blast of K-pop blaring through their speakers as you walk in. We had the kimchi fried rice with beef (2 plates actually), regular kfc (spicy has peanuts), kimchi and pork pancake, and calamari (actually tempura fried so it's more crispy and a little cleaner). Results? Nothing is great, but nothing is overly salty or inadequate. KFC was fried really well, and we were glad we got the original because the spicy one is glazed, but there wasn't a lot of meat on those bones, and there wasn't too much to taste in terms of the chicken. Calamari was a little chewy, but the pancake was freaking huge. The portion size for this could feed a team. Love it. Its taste was pretty pretty mediocre, as none of the kimchi or pork flavor came through. Kimchi fried rice was sticky and delicious and not glazed to death in red kimchi sauce. It came out to $75 with tax and tip, which isn't the best pricing you can get for Korean, but then again, you're not going to find SoCal prices here.", "author": "Danny C."}

Their service was so great. I really loved their stir fried yak udon with seafood. They have lots of menu and almost everything was tasty. They have many kinds of soju and korean alcohols. They also make cocktail soju and it was awesome. Usually people line up during weekends but not super busy on weekdays.", "author": "Be C."}

Not bad...not bad at all.  We don't eat meat, so we're at a disadvantage most of the time.  In this case, we actually enjoyed our meal.  The seafood pancake was plenty big and plenty good.  The omelette fried rice was really tasty.  The deep fried squid plenty.  The grilled mussels (it has cheese btw), was decent.  The service is efficient and friendly, the place...clean in a eclectic decor sorta way.  Only draw back is the somewhat loud music they play.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-26", "description": "It blew my mind that I never realized Ocean Ave. was missing a Korean joint until this place came along. Imagine my surprise when I was on Yelp looking for a soju bar and I found this gem! \n\nWait Time: I don't know if it's because no one knows about this place yet or what, but for a Saturday night it was not busy at all. We came at 7PM. There was no wait. My friend walked right in and got us a table. That's not to say it's quiet or empty. There were always a few tables empty but there was always people coming and leaving, as in dining and paying their bill. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT BEFORE MORE PEOPLE START COMING!\n\nEnvironment: It's like they decorated with modern art physically... Not paintings, but the way things were designed reminded me of those modern art pieces that are worth a fortune but look like someone just used Windows' paint to create \"art\". There's music playing, but not overwhelming. You can hear it but you'll still be able to hear your friends talking. LADIES RESTROOM WAS CLEAN. \n\nService: All hail the magical bell. I don't know why more places don't have these. The servers are very friendly. They didn't check on us (which I prefer). Whenever we pressed the call button, they responded promptly. I'm sure if you're one of those people who like chatting, they'd be happy to chat. \n\nFOOD: You know what, FOOD IS THE WORLD TO ME but even though I didn't think the food was all that I'd still come back. \n     (1) Korean Sea Snail Salad: This was so refreshing with the apple and cucumber slices. I like sea snail but they were only so-so. The sauce was a little overwhelming. Though it paired great with the apple slices! I love spicy, but I feel like it was too spicy for a salad... Probably just me though...\n     (2) Chicken Gizzard: THE MOST AMAZING DRINK FOOD. I don't know why but I've only just started eating chicken gizzard, but only Korean style. It is just so delicious! It pairs great with alcohol. This came with minced garlic and spring onions, which was heavenly. Can you tell this was my favorite dish?\n     (3) Corn with Mozzarella Cheese: My friend said it was a little dry because it was just mozzarella and no other kinds of cheeses. It was ok to me. Nothing impressive, but wasn't bad either. Definitely eat this while it is still hot.\n     (4) Chicken Wings: Dry. The wings/drums were dry. We weren't fans of it... Of the whole plate, we only ate three or four pieces. Aside from being dry, there wasn't much flavor either. It also came with a salad, which we didn't touch, and radishes! Yummy... radishes... You NEED that for Korean fried chicken!\n     (5) Peach Soju: Yum! Soju taste wasn't overwhelming. Peach taste wasn't too sweet. It was just a really good mix. I wish we had tried their other soju cocktails too, but we only had this... :( [Note: They state very clearly on their menu that they check IDs for everyone who will drink]\n\nIf I come again, I'd like to try some other things. If all else fails: DRINKS AND GIZZARDS! That's all I need.", "author": "Bonnie C."}

Each waitress that works here is super friendly and all smiles. They thank you when they are they giving you your food, like what? I'm telling you, they're all so friendly and welcoming. Even when they are closing, they will not kick you out 10 minutes before like Tonight does. Second of all, their food is good! You must order the seafood and scallion pancake and the kimchi stew. The sauce they give you with the pancake is perfect, it's flavorful and a little spicy. The portion is pretty big to share with friends and it is not greasy as compared to other places. As for their soju, they are $11 but the bottle is smaller than other places. My favorite is the strawberry, it's sweet and delicious! They have a cucumber soju and I do not recommend it because it's not sweet and it's  flavorless. Overall, this place is pretty solid and I'm glad that not much people know about it so that I don't ever need to wait for table when I come. I really think it's better than Toyose in terms of service and food. Plus, they open till 2am on weekdays!", "author": "Brenda K."}

The picture of the Kim Chee Fried Rice in the Sunday SF Chronicle is no way the size of the order you get, actual order is a much smaller portion.  Had to order a second order of Kim Chee Fried Rice.  Food is average, have had better fried chicken wings.  pancake was average, beef order was not char broiled but tasted more like stirred fried?
