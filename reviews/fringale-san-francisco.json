I strongly suggest wine with every dish as it really enhances all of the flavors. I appreciated the Acme bread served with butter. We went with the 3 course option. I got the calamari, steak with frites, and the flourless chocolate cake. All of which were delicious. I highly recommend ordering the calamari. Don't be afraid to go with what the waiters recommendations on wines because they're spot on. I do recommend having a reservation. We went on a slow holiday night and it quickly became full.

This is a great place for more upscale and fine dining in SOMA not too far from the Caltrain. Fringale is pretty appropriate for fancier and more romantic dates, as the setting is pretty intimate and cozy. Make reservations on OpenTable if you're coming on a weekend.\n\nI've taken my family here a few times now and Fringale has always been a pretty memorable spot for us near downtown SF. It's a bit easy to miss as it's surrounded by a lot of shabbier looking buildings and there's always construction around. Once you're inside, you're welcomed with furnishings and a setting that reminds me a lot like eating at nice seafood restaurants in New England. It has a very East Coast feel and ambiance to it that I haven't quite figured out exactly how to describe yet. Note that it can get quite crammed if it's a full house.\n\nThe menu is pretty pared down with some dishes that rotate or stay consistent. \"Les entrees\"/appetizer are $12, \"les plats\"/entree are $27, \"jardin\"/salad are $7 and desserts are $9. It seems like seafood is their forte here. There's also a nice deal to get a fixed price \"entree\"/appetizer + \"plat\"/entree + dessert for $47 I believe if you're looking to try a lot of things. We enjoyed the food so much we ended up just getting dessert as well so I would say if you're hesitant you should just go for it since it doesn't make a huge difference.\n\nI would say the entrees are sized are pretty well portioned out and you'll definitely get stuffed. I recall most things being pretty solid besides the Organic Roasted Chicken Breast that my friend got one time. The Seafood Basquaise is a bit underwhelming and too salty for my likes as well.\n\nLES ENTREES/APPETIZERS ($12)\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Prawns in Pastis -  Red & yellow cherry tomatoes, shallots & chives. This appetizer is what keeps me coming back! Highly recommend this if you're a fan of shrimp and dipping your complimentary bread into this amazing sauce. The sauce has a citrusy and savory taste to it that's really delightful in my opinion. You've missed out if you haven't ordered this!\n\nJARDIN/SALADS ($7)\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad (Special) - Most of the salad specials are pretty good. Veggies were fresh!\n\nEndive & Arugula Salad - My personal favorite salad here as it has nutty and crunchy components to it. \n\nLES PLATS/ENTREES ($27)\n\nSteamed PEI Mussels & French Fries - Fried garlic, fresh herbs, shallots & sherry vinegar. Prepare for a huge bucket of mussels and what seems to be like hand cut french fries. \n\nSauteed Petrale Sole -  Artichokes, asparagus, fennel, risotto, piquillo pepper sauce. Gorgeous presentation with the vivid orange sauce. You basically get two servings of the sole too, which makes the dish very filling. Very tender!\n\nDESSERTS ($9)\n\nHazelnut & Roasted Almond Mousse Cake - Layers of hazelnut mousse and genoise topped with roasted almonds. Not too special, could skip out on.\n\nTarte Tatin Aux Pommes - Warm caramelized apple tarte with vanilla ice cream & creme fraiche. They did a pretty good job with this one.\n\nI love Fringale and I'll always come back when my parents visit town. It's a special place for us to reunite and the servers are very friendly.", "author": "Chelsea W."}

We were running late at a previous function and they were kind enough to extend the reservation time when called. Very understated location and upon entering we were quickly shown to our table for four. Like most major cities seating was tight as they make use of the small space. The service was excellent and our server Romain a solid 5. Very attentive and assisted my friend as she was looking for gluten free options though her choices are limited in the end. For drinks I wanted a Captain Morgan and Coke  but they had Sailor Jerry instead. No worries it was a good stiff drink just what I needed. \nMy dining companions and I noticed a strange aroma in the air. Once my dinner of mussels arrived I figured out the mystery to jarred garlic. Which has a particular aroma and flavor profile. Neither enhanced the mussells for me in fact it probably was the worst I ever had. This was disappointing as I was looking forward to eating them. My companions had the cod and corvina and they all enjoyed their meals. But agreed it wasn't great food albeit excellent service.", "author": "Clarissa K."}

Always weird when someone asks you \"how many in your reservation?\" As if to say \"you better have a reservation\" or \"you don't clearly have a reservation\". Maybe I'm due being too sensitive and it was more in the tone, but I got the sense that they didn't really care whether we were there or not.\n\nReally enjoyed the foie gras appetizer. As well as they served some pretty amazing bread. However, the mussels and fries entr\u00e9e had mussels bathed in vinegar and dry and almost inedible. The sole entree was weirdly covered in a not-French pepper sauce. Also the sole was a bit dry and the combination of risotto sole and pepper sauce just didn't really come together.\n\nThe chocolate cake dessert which was weirdly a little dry but mostly tasted good.\n\nNothing special, a bit pretentious and probably won't see these guys again.", "author": "Bob K."}

Obviously we had read and reread the menu at home we were ready to order the second we walked in. \n\nWe started our meal with the soup of the day which happened to be butternut squash (my favorite!) and their endive and arugula salad (with just olive oil on top).

No apology, no remorse, and didn't even ask me how they could make it right?! It was an absurd reaction. He then asks \"Do you want me to take it away or what?\" Of course I have them take it away and I get another order of foie gras because this is soft and easy to chew as I was already experiencing some nerve pain. I explained to our waiter, upon ordering the foie gras, that I expect to not have to pay for it. The waiter agreed. I had to say this because like I said, No one showed any concern or remorse and instead made me feel like it's my problem. No one ever asked me if I was ok. Of course when the check arrives it had the foie on there and I had to again tell them pretty pointedly that I will not be paying for it and have further discussion because the waiter said \"I cannot just not charge for two dish\"\n\nI understand that lentils and beans can sometimes have stones in the packaging which is why you have to clean them extremely well and as a restaurant it is YOUR RISK that YOU TAKE, when you serve them. \n\nMY TOOTH IS CHIPPED and I'm experiencing quite a bit of pain from it and based off of the overall attitude of the staff and complete lack of concern I have a right mind to pursue this.

Celebrating Bastille Day in San Francisco as vacation vs. work, work wins this year, French country house has to wait. Took the family out. It's not fancy dinner but I've heard plenty of good things about it. It's right next to my favorite winter spot in SoMa: Cockscomb, so it's easy to find. Especially with the never ending construction, it's perfect for a meal when everyone else wants to avoid that street.\n\nBastille menu was a very decent deal. At $46 a head. I thought it was \u00a346 per head as I just returned from UK and it was not. Whew! Pomme Frites were fabulous. I could eat that all night. Onion tart? I dissed it only to find out vert quickly this is filled with greens and protein, the tart was quite deliciously flaky. Charcuterie hit the spot. \n\nI paused. All those eating out in the Avenues had deprived me from my true passion for French food. It's always been my calling. Fringale reminded me how much I've missed my adopted home's food. I savored the charcuterie. It's all mine. \n\nVeal short ribs were on the fattier side this evening, and I did love it. Moules were filled with garlic and I did enjoy it more than some other places. It was more flavorful than some other places and it's perfect just the way it was. Salmon was a surprise hit. \n\nFrench does Apple tart well. Just like Germans does Apple Strudel well. Don't forget the apple tart.\n\nBread basket was filed with baguette which was always a nice welcome considering some places now ask you to pay for bread. \n\nFood was cooked very well. One could tell that given the longevity of this restaurant, preparing for really high quality food is not an issue here. All arrived relatively quickly, despite the filled restaurant. Service was very good, and polished, as you'd expect for a place like this.\n\nOne thing that is for sure: I have been suffering fro separation anxiety with good French food, for reasons as simple as I want to eat healthier and consume less caloric food. But on Bastille day, and for the love of French cuisine, one must indulge oneself once in a great while.\n\nLast year I celebrated Bastille Day with a very dear friend of mine at the newly opened Monsieur Benjamin. The year before, I was in France with the family. I suppose I like to keep my tradition intact. If there is anything resembles the love affair of a lifetime, it's my love for French food. Fringale reminded me just how much so tonight. For that, I'm thankful.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I think my favorite was the sole and I normally don't even like sole prepared that way. For the entrees, I was a little uninspired with the choices. In hindsight, I probably should have just ordered off the SFRW menu. But that would have defeated the purpose of going, right? The desserts were good and enjoyed by all.\n\nFor SFRW, Fringale offers a decent menu. But I really wish they offered a steak or something a little more enticing on their menu. The rest of the courses were good though. Not sure what happened to the restaurant I enjoyed so much so many years ago, but for SFRW, Fringale was just alright.", "author": "Elena N."}

You can easily hear the conversations from the table next to you so if you want a romantic dinner where people can't hear your conversations, this is not the place. The menu has a set price and you choose one from the appetizer, main course, and dessert. The menu was kind of limited as each section had about 3 choices to choose from.

All of the staff that we encountered had very thick french accents as well.\n\nThe food was generally pretty good and off of the prix fixe menu I ordered the spinach ravioli, the lamb shank and the almond cake dessert. I also saw a poached egg bacon dressing salad which I gluttonously ordered on top of all the rest. At the start we were brought complimentary crostinis with various meats and cheeses which were excellent. The salad was good and I liked the egg/dressing/bacon combo, but the greens were just a bit too light and could have stood to be more leafy. The ravioli was decent but nothing that special. The lamb shank was delicious (as are most lamb shanks) and I thought it was delivered well with a tasty sauce. I expected a bit more out of the almond cake but I did enjoy it thoroughly and ate it all. \n\nOverall, this seems like an above average french place which may be just a bit too expensive to dine at regularly.

The menu has plenty of fish options, which I am a fan of. I wish they would do specials more often. They once had coq au vin as a special and it was phenomenal, but I've not seen any other specials available since that visit. \"Soup of the day\" seems to always be potato leek. My favorite on the menu is the moules et frites.\n\nAlso, the waiters have charming French accents, but I kind of wonder about that, because I ordered my moules et frites in French once and the French-accented waiter could not understand. I had to tell him \"mussels and fries,\" and it's just bizarre to me that any French speaker would not understand an order for moules et frites. So, I kind of wonder whether the French accent is affected, but I suppose that doesn't really matter. It's charming and the food is great. \n\nI would say the tables are crammed in pretty close and it can get pretty loud. God help you if you are seated at a table with a person whose voice carries, because you will be privy to their entire conversation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-02", "description": "This place was packed on a Sunday night and that could only mean two things, either the food here is delicious or DAT has arrived. \n\nWe ordered the calamari, pork tenderlion wrapped in bacon, and almond mousse cake from the DAT menu and the Dungeness crab Napolean, duck confit from the regular menu.\n\nThe calamari and Dungeness crab Napolean appetizers were both superb. The calamari wasn't super chewy where you have to chomp away at it for like 20 bites until you feel like you've broken it down. The legs were the best part since it had retained most of the flavor. The Dungeness crab Napolean had so much crab! With all that Dungeness crab layered with avocado, I don't see why anyone wouldn't love this dish. I was surprised by how much flavor the crab had and the mango sauce was equally delicious.\n\nThen came the entrees. The pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon was so juicy and tender yet it was still cooked all the way through. This was my favorite dish of the night and I really wish I could have ordered another one. The duck confit was a huge disappointment. Seeing how it was so highly rated by Yelpers, I decided to give it a shot. The beans, the thinly sliced potato, and the red wine sauce were all enjoyable, but the overcooked duck just killed the dish for me. \n\nThe dessert was a hazelnut & roasted almond mousse cake. If you like the rich creamy taste of almond, then this is the perfect dessert. \n\nAt first, the service was fast since we were the only table that had been seated for the second wave of reservations. Then as more groups were seated, the service slowed down to the point where we had to wait almost 15 minutes for our entree plate to be taken away and the dessert to be brought out.

Maybe it's just the diligent (read: anal) Yelper in me, but it's always bothered me that I haven't been able to write a review about you.  Sadly, it had been too many years since that Dine About Town for me to recall all the details of what I had (steak frites?).\n\nSo, when it came time to pick a restaurant for our annual holiday, I knew exactly where to go (though my slightly drunk friend probably had no idea where he was during dinner...).  Fortunately, the food tasted just as good as before.  It's a good thing for you too Fringale, because otherwise I might have started thinking of you with a tinge of annoyance for an entirely different reason!\n\n- CRAB NAPOLEON - Dungeness Crab, Avocado, Corn Salsa, Lemon Zest, Arugula, and Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche (?)...$16\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fringale-san-francisco?select=ntiWk4eUFFCjZAPaF42W8g#S2XELHWEUJI5pUvcqeyxHw)\nHands down, the best thing I tried the whole night.  The crab was both incredibly fresh and delicious, the avocado added a great complimentary flavor, and the lemon zest gave it that hit of citrus the dish needed.  The other components will vary and change periodically, but it's an absolute must get.\n\n- ROASTED RACK OF LAMB with Gruyere Potato Gratin, Harticots Verts, and a Rosemary Sauce...$28\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fringale-san-francisco?select=ntiWk4eUFFCjZAPaF42W8g#bXzfNBhmNK6NLBhQVd-SVA)\nDecent for the most part.  The lamb was flavorful, tender, and mild in gaminess.  There could have been a little more herbs on the lamb and/or in the sauce, but fine otherwise.  However, I thought one of my pieces of lamb was more medium to medium well than medium rare, and the portion felt a little light for the money.  I wasn't expecting a beastly portion, but still more than what I had received.\n\n- CR\u00c8ME BR\u00dbL\u00c9E...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fringale-san-francisco?select=ntiWk4eUFFCjZAPaF42W8g#7D_Y41mo-ZNuDFxFE--lqA)\nMuch like my lamb, it was mostly hit...with some miss.  The flavor was spot on, and I liked the strawberries on top, but the sugary crust was disappointing!  Half of it had that nice, crunchy topping you'd expect, while the other half was borderline flimsy.  Disappointing in that respect, but not bad overall.\n\nMuch like my lamb and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, service was mostly solid with one miss of note.  When the two filet mignons my friends had ordered were brought out, our server never ciphered which one was cooked medium and which one was cooked rare.  The orders ended up getting flipped, and my friends didn't realize the mistake until they were both halfway through (they both thought it was just cooked wrong).\n\nDespite my somewhat minor quibbles with the service, price, and food though, Fringale did enough to earn four stars.  The intimate ambiance got them there, but the Crab Napoleon is what really sealed the deal.  A plate of it to share on a date with my future girlfriend?  Yeah, that works for me!", "author": "Mike L."}

Literally this small, cozy place was like being transported to France. The restaurant was surprisingly not crowded for lunch and it was easy to hold conversation. The service was a mix of attentive and patient, even throwing a joke in to amuse our party. The service is certainly where Fringale stands out. \n\nAnyway, no one in our party ordered snails.

There is nothing like a good baguette, especially if it is warm. Someone else in our party said this, but I certainly mimic that sentiment. Unfortunately, I eagerly grabbed a piece of baguette and it was, dare I say it, stale. It was not warmed up and I actually left it on my plate. \n-I ended up ordering the heirloom tomato salad which tasted very fresh with the tomatoes and goat cheese. The cheese was creamy enough to add a great bite and creamy texture to every bite.\n-Our table got some fries (or whatever they're properly termed at fancy restaurants) to share.

I am not a big fan of the roasted rack of lamb with Gruyere potato gratin, haricots verts, and rosemary sauce - it has too much citris flavor.  The french fries (\"frites\") are very good, especially with a side of sea salt.

We were happy to get reservations here at a reasonable time. the restaurant is on the small side, but it creates a very intimate atmosphere. It would be perfect for a date. The service was also prompt and very friendly. \n\nNow for the food! The bread and appetizers that came first were fresh and enjoyable. Our calamari dish was exquisite. It is a must order. We didn't expect there to be so much, but we finished it. The sauce from the calamari also paired well with the bread. \n\nFor the main course I ordered the petrale sole and my friend ordered the lamb. I was a little disappointed they weren't offering the sea bass anymore, but the fish was very moist and the risotto and artichoke sauce paired nicely. The crispy edges have the fish a nice touch. My friend's lamb shank was amazing. The meat fell off the bone and she was kind enough to share some. \n\nWe were both extremely full before dessert came, but we couldn't resist! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with vanilla beans was very creamy and smooth, while the chocolate gourmand was still hot when served.

Best of all, the food was amazing:\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad: Fresh fruit (yes, tomatoes are technically fruit) combined with a homemade dressing and just the right smattering of cheese. The colors and presentation alone make this dish worth ordering, but it's the explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth that will leave you gushing about it to your co-workers the next day.\n\nRoasted Chicken with Pearl Couscous: What do you get when you perfectly roast a chicken so that the meat melts in your mouth, the skin crackles when you bite it and the flavorful jus seeps into the equally well-cooked couscous and vegetables? A comfort food dish with a dash of European sophistication that reminds you why this most common of meats is a perennial favorite.\n\nHazelnut Almond Mousse Cake: Hazelnuts and almonds are proof that nature knows best. A dessert that combines these two flavors? Proof that the pastry chef knows best. The cake was moist and creamy without being overwhelming rich. We polished this off within minutes.\n\nPear Martini: My treat to myself after a long day at work. Custom-made and perfectly mixed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-09", "description": "Based on the ratings, I had high hopes for this restaurant. My friends and I were extremely disappointed by our restaurant week experience here however. It began with the menu, when my friend and I were saddened by the fact that they swapped out the sea bass (listed online as the menu option) with sole. I decided that it wouldn't hurt to ask, so I checked with the waiter on whether the sea bass was still offered, or if there's only the sole. He responded grumpily that he would check with the chef. Probably ten minutes later, he comes back and in an annoyed voice asks what we would like to order. I tried to confirm whether the sea bass was offered, and he snapped back at me stating that they reserve the right to change the menu if they want, and said he would ask the chef (I guess he didn't ask the first time?). This time he returned, glared at me, and said yes the chef can accommodate our requests and make sea bass. It was a rather sour start to the meal, and my friends and I may have had a better experience just leaving and going somewhere else at that point. But to our own mistake, we stayed and ordered quite a few dishes.\n\nAppetizers:\nRavioli: The ravioli was rather disappointing in taste. The somewhat pungent cheese of their choice overpowered the rest of the flavors, making for a bland ravioli with a strong tasting cheese.\nCalamari: I didn't have any of the calamari, but I heard that it was pretty good.\n\nEntrees:\nSea bass: Their sea bass portion was fair, but the flavoring of the overall dish was mediocre. While a decent dish, I found it overpriced for what they prepared.\nDuck Confit: Their duck, considered it was duck confit, was surprisingly dry. I was also surprised that they didn't crisp the skin or anything either. The lentils with the dish were prepared well, but the duck unfortunately made the dish disappointing as well.\nPork tenderloin: This was easily the best dish of the three. The meat was tender and flavorful, and bacon on the dish of course made it all the better.\n\nDessert: The highlight of the meal! All in pretty good portion sizes as well (besides the creme brulee in a small bowl rather than a tradition ramekin)\nCreme brulee: Their creme brulee was pretty good, especially since they used a bit of vanilla bean to accentuate the flavor.\nWarm chocolate gourmand: As a pretty big chocolate eater, i loved this. Flavorful, and being flourless definitely did not make the cake any different from my expectations.\nGateau Basque: I love almonds, so this almond torte with custard cream was great as well.\n\nOverall, the meal was an average meal (~3 stars) with -2 stars for service but +1 star for letting us still order sea bass. I think for the price though, SF offers many other options that I would likely have preferred. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes, or caught the waiter on a bad day, but the service was really appalling. I'll take my meal that I'm paying for WITHOUT the slamming down of plates please. Also, be prepared for rather tight seating arrangements at the restaurant, but street parking on the Friday night we went to was ample and cheap (~$2-3 for 3 hours somehow?)", "author": "Michael L."}

Be mindful, the dress code is Business Casual and not Casual as it is disclose in the business information pane (otherwise you will feel out of place).\n\nParking is a pain if there is a Giants game going on (street parking), otherwise is rather easy to find an open spot. The place has a nice layout and decor, the restaurant was packed considering it was a Tuesday night (I took that as a good sign that the food was really good).\n\nThey showed us to our table and were immediately greeted by the server. I was concerned that there was only one server for the whole establishment on a busy night, there was another individual helping out (I think he was the bus boy). I would off knock points off for the lack of attention (he will check with us now and then, but we had to get his attention if we needed something), however, it would be unfair considering he was taking care of the whole dining area. Be aware that the drinks here are strong, we order a long island ice tea and a margarita, it makes you wonder if you can get some flavor or juice with your alcohol (I did not mind as much as my wife did, she end up getting a glass of red wine, while I enjoyed my alcohol).\n\nWe order two appetizers, the Heirloom Tomato salad and the calamari. Both were nicely done, salad was fresh and the acid provided by the tomato gave the dish a nice balance. I was impressed by how well the calamari was done, there was no rubbery feel to the squid and the seasoning was light, the black olives gave the dish a bold taste without overpowering the dish.\n\nMy wife order the sea bass, I had a bite and the crispiness of the outer layer of the fish was very good while maintaining the tenderness of the fish on the inside. It went well with the sauce and rest of the dish. I ordered the seafood combination and it was very well done, the sauce gave it a nice balance thou it could be less sweet. The deserts were very good, apple tart and hazelnut moose, we liked the hazelnut best out of the two deserts.\n\nIn closing, don't let the area where the restaurant is located fool you (lots of construction going on), the staff is friendly as long as they are not too busy (towards the end of the night, less patrons better service). Food is very good, drinks are too strong for people not a costumed to having more alcohol in their drinks than mixture.

All I remember is that the service was fantastic (polite and not overbearing) and the parking was a dream for SF. If you're looking for delicious French food and don't want to deal with the hassle of scarce parking spots and hills, it's reason enough to go to Fringale! Also makes an absolutely cute date night place.\n\n(+) Chicken breast with couscous - the tender chicken breast lay on a generous bed of pearly couscous. It's hearty and satisfying, but not in a grease-filled, heavy kind of way. It's just really well-prepared and enjoyable. Pairs super well with a glass of white.\n(+) Roasted rack of lamb - tender, the meat flaked right off the bone. After I attacked this all that was left was the clean bone. It's a simply prepared and presented dish but the lamb is very flavorful, the potatoes are creamy, and the haricots verts add a nice crunch. Pairs super well with a glass of red.\n\nTheir menu doesn't seem to change much, which is also a testament to their dishes being a hit with diners. It is a little pricey, so if you're curious about it and can wait, Fringale usually participates in Dine About Town. You can get a great taste of it then.", "author": "Brandy A."}

There isn't anything on the menu that's particularly innovative (or you couldn't find anywhere else), but what I tried was really good.\n\nI had the rib-eye steak frites which was delicious. It was really tender and cooked to my requested medium rare perfectly. The shallot butter on top was really tasty as well, adding a nice richness and savory taste on top of the already flavorful steak. \n\nThe frites were okay. While I would have preferred them to be a little more crispy, they tasted great with the aoili that I requested on the side. The aoili was really good, just a hint of garlic and a touch of tang. It was quite thick though (as if it were just straight up mayo), but I actually liked it that way.\n\nThe desert was pretty good. I tried the Pain Perdu (bread pudding with chocolate and bananas). It was moist and chocolatey, with the flavor of banana lingering throughout.  \n\nNot sure if I'd go out of my way to come back, but if I were in the area, I would most certainly know where to go to have some really good French cuisine.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

We were already squished trying to fit our group in, we ended up sitting at a long table but the tables on one end were right against the wall so it was very difficult to get in and out. Staff was pretty nice about it though and pulled tables out before and after our meal to make it slightly easier.\n\nI ordered the duck confit. Potatoes and bacon were especially good, lentils were okay. The duck was really good and it definitely wasn't one of those times that you have to deal with all the tiny bones that ducks have.

We had a 6pm reservation (booked through opentable.com) but due to a parking attending locking keys in a car, we were unable to get our car out of the lot.  Knowing we would be late, I called the restaurant explaining the situation to the male who picked the phone and was then passed off to another male who said he we may or may not get seated at a table once we got there, either that or we'll have to sit at the bar.  As we arrived 20 minutes late, there were many tables available.\n\nFOOD:\n*Steamed PEI Mussels ($17) - Not bad.  The mussels were had a heavy amount of garlic, shallots, and a vinaigrette like sauce.  Although the mussels were flavorful, they were tiny!!\n\n*Marinated Bay Scallops - *GAG* I hate wasting food so I forced myself to eat the scallops.  The scallops were cooked enough to be slightly cooked but still gave off that raw feeling and had a tangy taste to it.  Sadly, the best part of the appetizer was the small salad that came with it.\n\n*Filet Mignon - I ordered the meat medium rare, but it came out medium to well.  I've had filet mignon on many occasions and even though I'm not a meat eater, I enjoy eating a piece of filet.  However, this didn't taste like a filet at all - the meat was not tender and chewy!  I enjoyed the string beans and fries that came as sides - that was the best part of my entr\u00e9e.  \n\n*Cr\u00e8me Brulee - The best part of my meal was the dessert.  The top was perfectly crisped while the content was sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was not friendly and lacked social and customer service skills.  Not once did I see a smile on his face nor do I remember him checking to see if everything is okay with our table.  I would categorize Fringale as a nicer, somewhat classier restaurant and I'm sure that's how they perceive themselves.  However, good service should obviously come with that perception and they're really lacking in that department.\n\nPARKING:\nMetered street parking (free after 6pm)\n\nOh yeah, I called in mentioning that we would be late and we check and were seated once we arrived.  However, the next day I checked my OpenTable account and they put me down as a no show.  I had to go through the trouble of submitting an incident with OpenTable.\n\nThanks Fringale...Never again...", "author": "Nicole S."}

The ambiance is intimate so I would recommend coming here with a smaller group. Ordered off the Dine About Town menu and here are my recommendations:\n+ Lamb Shank - The shank was huge and so tender that it fell off the bone. So good and I don't even like lamb goddamnit! \n+ Spicy Calamari - Lots of calamari with spicy peppers made it super flavorful. I give it bonus points since it was not fried. \n+ Salmon Risotto - The top of the salmon was pan fried to give it a crunchiness and cooked to perfection with a vegetable risotto underneath to balance out the flavors. \n\nOverall everything was good. We also ordered the following:\n= Roquefort & Spinach Ravioli - Ravioli was very good but it could have used a little more salt. \n= Creme Brulee - I'm biased because I've never really been a fan. \n= Warm Chocolat Gourmand (chocolate flour-less cake) - Nothing about this stood out. \n\nI would definitely go back!", "author": "Donna W."}

The dressing was a very light tangy vinegarette and salad was mixed in with grapefruit and oranges. Lobster was buttery and cooked perfectly. Probably one of the best salads I've had out at dinner. I killed it!\nMy bf chose the foie gras. It came with cute lil heart shaped toasts and some pomegranate jelly. Who doesn't love foie gras? I'm not a fan of jelly but had to try the combination and it actually worked well.\nFor the main course, I had the duck and it was ok. It's prepared medium rare which makes it very tough to chew. My bf had the filet mignon and wasn't too fond of it. He asked for medium but it was more like over medium. Duck was preferred over the filet mignon.\nFor desert we had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (not bad) and chacolate marquise. If you like chocolate desserts, order the chacolate marquise.

Staff was polite and efficient. We will definitely come back more often, and not wait years between visits! Obviously they are doing something right when the restaurant has been around for so long and still is delicious!\n\nSome quick comments: For appetizers (my husband had three as dinner), we had the beef carpaccio, spinach and blue cheese ravioli, calamari and foie gras terrine.

The foie gras was the first I've had since it's been back in SF - we liked spreading the foie gras over the bread basket bread and the fresh quince jam - too bad there wasn't more jam! We usually have fried calamari, but we really enjoyed the saut\u00e9ed calamari.

I've been here three times in the past few years (first review), and have never been impressed by their food. Unfortunately, the bf's parents like this restaurant, and we had to dine here once again the other night. Luckily they paid for the meal, otherwise I probably would've rounded down to one star for the meh food and high prices. We ordered:\n\n-Frites & Aioli ($6, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g#PCQFQeEc1vOWCglMZyaimQ): The only dish from their menu that I've liked. The frites were nice and crispy, and went will with the aioli. However, I enjoyed the frites from L'Ardoise more.\n-Roquefort & Spinach Ravioli (Toasted Pine Nuts, Basil & Cream Sauce, $12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g#B52EmxnJT8HW1Fa_EgFm0Q): The only other dish that I liked. The ravioli skin seemed freshly made and was very tender. The basil and cream sauce went well with the Roquefort and spinach filling.\n-Fris\u00e9e Salad w/Warm Bacon Dressing, Pine Nuts, Poached Egg & Toasted Levain ($11, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g#ZnL1a0VRLYCjTOXIIjHivQ): This sounded enticing on the menu, but there was way too much vinaigrette, and I had to shake off excess dressing before every bite. There was also a hair in my salad (whoever has long, dark hair in the kitchen should really wear a hairnet), but I didn't make a big deal since I never intend to dine at this establishment again.\n-Creekstone Farm Black Angus Ribeye Steak, Pommes Frites & Red Wine Butter Sauce ($28, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g#7VeqhDA5TjRnGXPJX-p3mg): It's hard to mess up a ribeye, but Fringale someone managed to achieve this rare feat. It didn't even look like a cut of ribeye, and certainly didn't taste like one with all the gristle and chewy meat.\n-Spinach w/Roquefort Cheese ($6, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g#RuS9QAUpXSHXSKLwvt4A1g): Ok, but the sauteed spinach was very soggy.\n-Haricots Verts ($6, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g#6wAG6kD89ndISddfE9K21g): Super limp haricots verts.. I prefer mine a little crunchier.\n\nIt didn't help that the service we received was brusque, and I don't think one of our servers smiled once. I had to continually flag them down to refill our butter, or get a to-go box, or get the check. Our small table began to get crowded since they didn't bother to remove the empty plates. Just because it's towards the end of the night doesn't mean you should slack on your service! In any case, there are much better French restaurants in the city to dine at, and even much better restaurants around this area (Coco500, Marlowe).

However, there was a BIG party going on that took up most of the tiny restaurant, and sadly enough, some people got turned down since it was pretty busy/packed.\n\nSince I'm not a big French foodie, I decided to play it safe and order the roasted chicken, while my friend got her foie gras. The server did warn me that the chicken was going to take about 20-30 minutes, which I was fine with.\n\nThe chicken was good, not GREAT, not BAD, but good. I did like the little side dishes that came along with the plate, but it wasn't anything too special that I would have remembered.\n\nBecause of the party, service was on the bad side, hence the one star drop. I do understand you'll probably get more money from the party than the rest of the people eating, but what the servers should have done was shoo the people that were blocking pathways, allowing other customers to go in and out of the restaurant and the restroom with ease. Also, it took a little longer to get our check.\n\nWe did wanted to stay a bit longer, so we took a glance at the menu.

I suppose.\n\nBut I've recently been reading a lot of reviews mentioning a variety of different pork dishes. And, to me, the one pork dish I still think about all this time later was the succulent pork tenderloin I ordered here.\n\nThat bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with braised Napa cabbage, onion & apple marmalade still resonates fond memories of a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience for me and my dinner companions that night even until this today! And for only $20, it is one of the best deals you will find for fine French dining in the city.\n\nThe pork was brined and pan-roasted to a cafefully prepared medium-rare, its brilliant pink flesh beneath a marbled crust that was as succulent and tender as any pork dish I've ever tried.\n\nThe roasted rack of lamb with potato gratin, haricots verts and rosemary sauce, $25, was my second favorite dish. I rarely order lamb because, if not well prepared, the meat tastes rather gamely to me. Not so here. The lamb was delicious, delicately seasoned, very tender, its flesh a beautifully vibrant burgundy. Roasted lamb in rosemary sauce with potatoes is always a happy marriage of flavors and texture in my opinion.\n\nThe Seafood basquaise - salmon, cod, prawns, tuna, mussels, red pepper & tomato coulis, $23, was disappointing. Generally my favorite dish at a French restaurant. Something was just off that day. I don't think the mussels were all that fresh.\n\nI've learned that this popular French bistro has been under new ownership since 2005. I hope the tradition of great dishes and service at more reasonable prices (most dishes under $25) continues to this day.", "author": "Andrew K."}

My party and I arrived 10 minutes early last week for our dinner reservation, yet were seated 30 minutes after our reservation time...\n\nI was also concerned about the quality of the service going into it as several folks mentioned an air of conceit and bias towards the younger crowd, but there was none of that and I ended up being quite pleased with our server's promptness and politeness.  \n\nNow, onto the food:\n\n-Saut\u00e9ed prawns in Pastis, sun dried tomatoes, shallots & chives: fresh prawns and tasty sauce, but 5 small prawns for $13?  Meh.\n\n-Steamed Alaskan halibut, fennel, asparagus, sweet  corn, fava beans & lemon coriander:  fish was nicely cooked, but the tangy sauce clashed with it and the flavors really did not come together at all.\n\n-Braised veal short ribs, orzo, broccolini, baby carrots & morells mushrooms sauce: Quite good!  Short ribs were tender and the rice and veggies were perfectly cooked.\n\n-Mme. Ang\u00e8le's Gateau Basque: good almond torte with custard filling, though nothing exceptional.\n\n-Pre-fixe items:\nThe raw scallops and calamari were both nicely done with the former having a great, zesty vinaigrette and the latter a softness that wasn't at all overly chewy.   \nThe filet mignon was disappointing - it was cooked well, but the meat itself was gritty rather than tender and the flavor was sorely lacking...definitely something missing here.\nThe creme brulee was delicious and had excellent texture, while the almond mousse cake was a let-down...good mousse, but terribly dry cake.\n\nLess-than-stellar food aside, our server's wine recommendation was spot-on as we shared a bottle of Rully Premier Cru, Domaine Jaeger-Defaix, 2007.  It had light body with good fruit and a nice, long lingering finish.  \n\nAfter sampling an array of both regular and pre-fixe items, I have to say that this place really doesn't deserve the average it's gotten from the hundreds of reviews.  The food is reasonably priced for a French restaurant, but the quality doesn't even warrant the price point.  \n\nOh and it IS as cramped as everyone says.", "author": "Eric F."}

As soon as we walked in, we stood near the bar.  We were waiting for a host or hostess to bring us to our table.  I  thought it was kind of weird that the bar had no bartender .  After a few minutes, it seemed like none of the waiters noticed us.  I didn't see a hostess or host either.  Finally, I walked up to a waiter, and he asked if he can help us.  I told him that we had a reservation, and then we got seated near the window.  \n\nOur server was extremely nice and friendly to us.  I decided to order the crab ravioli, sole, and hazelnut mousse cake.  My boyfriend ordered the pate, fillet mignon, and chocolate gourmand.  After we ordered, we were given a basket full of sourdough and bagutte slices.  The bread was good, but I would have prefered it warm and toasted..lol.\n\nOur appetizers came out first.  There was 3 pieces of crab ravioli on my plate.  They were filled with a lot of crab, and it was very delicious in the lobster bisque.  I didn't like how it smelled a bit fishy though.\n\nMy boyfriend enjoyed his pate appetizer, too.  I tried some of the meat on his plate, and it was tasty with the toasted slice of bread.\n\nOur entrees came out next.  The sole was seared on one side, and it was a bit hot.  I had to let it cool down before I can bite into it...lol.  The risotto was really good!!\n\nMy boyfriend loved his fillet mignon.  He requested it get cooked 'medium', and it came out perfec.  He enjoyed the potato gratin, too.\n\nFor dessert, I loved the hazelnut mousse cake.  The layers of hazelnut, almond, and cake tasted very good with the chocolate base.  My boyfriend's chocolate gourmand was super delicious!  It reminded me of a warm brownie with vanilla ice cream.\n\nOverall, the service was good after we got seated.  All the dishes was super good and a decent size.  Parking was a bit difficult to find though, since there were no spots in the parking lot across the street. There was also no street parking, too.

I don't always like crab, but the crab with avocado was really light and delicious. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the braised lamb shank. I only started eating red meat a few months ago so I don't know much about lamb, but it was falling off the bone and pretty flavorful.

After the late afternoon Friday of Cirque du Soleil at the AT&T parking lot, we had 8PM reservations here.  We arrived a bit early and waited nearby as the then crowded restaurant was unable to accommodate us.  After about 15 minutes, a nice table was arranged for us.  \n\nThe restaurant was a bit noisy and the background music could have been turned down some.  Our waiter, a charming French man, was attentive and helpful.  French bread and butter was immediately brought out. Two of us shared a tasty  butter lettuce salad which they kindly split for us.  It was covered with a shaved petit basque with a mild vinaigrette dressing.  Three of us enjoyed a $38 bottle of Malbec.  Though expensive, it was a better value than ordering 3 individual glasses of wine.  The Malbec had a refreshing taste.\n\nFor the entrees, we had (2) roasted rack of lamb, with gruyere potato gratin, haricots verts (green beans) & rosemary sauce,  @ $28 each; traditional duck confit, lentils \"du puy\", potatoes landaises, garlic, bacon & red wine sauce,  $22;and a seafood basquaise of king salmon, seabass, prawns, tuna, mussels, red pepper & tomato coulis, $26.   \n\nThe two rack of lamb dinners were cooked to perfection and the presentation looked well.  The duck confit was a big disappointment as it was too dry.  The seafood dish was rather ordinary and unsatisfying with the shrimp and mussels being the only distinctive taste.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the salmon, seabass, or tuna chunks.\n\nFor dessert, we split the hazelnut & roasted almond mousse cake with layers of hazelnut mousse and genoise topped with roasted almonds  and a warm chocolate gourmand flourless chocolate cake served with a mint sorbet.  Both desserts were good, though most of our party preferred the chocolate cake.\n\nAfterwards, we spoke with an older gentleman, who may have been the manager and expressed our thoughts re the rack of lamb and the duck confit.  The manager blamed the California law prohibiting foie gras on the lean duck meat.  He claims that they can only get  rather thin duck legs which tend to be overly dry when prepared.  However, I thought that excuse seemed rather phoney.  If they knew the dish would be overly dry, they should take it off the menu or prepare it in some other way.\n\nThis restaurant is probably a solid 4, but the manager's comment about the duck confit knocked it down a notch.  We may come back again and try some other dishes.", "author": "Robert J."}

I also thought it was a bit strange that some dishes seemed to have Italian influences, even though this is a French restaurant. \n\nHere's what I ordered: \n1) Roquefort & spinach ravioli: So apparently roquefort is a fancy name for blue cheese, which I don't care for at all. Besides the flavor of the cheese all over the four delicate pieces of ravioli, this dish was pretty good. I thought ravioli was supposed to be Italian, so I'm not exactly sure why they're serving it here.\n\n2) Coq au Vin: Pronounced CO-CO-VANH, which was not on the DAT menu itself, but a special that they offered (at the dine about town price). The chicken was fall off the bone good, and the sauce seemed very similar to the sauce served with the lamb shank. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, otherwise I would've ordered that. This dish was the perfect alternative; not too salty, and exactly how it should taste in my mind. BRAVO!\n\n3) Coffee parfait: This really reminded me of a tiramisu minus the lady fingers and cream. There was quite a strong alcoholic (rum?) flavor to it too. It was basically half a wine glass of tiramisu ice cream if you can imagine that. The rum flavor started to get too strong for me in the end, and I wasn't able to finish it unfortunately. Again, Italian influences?! \n\nOther desserts that we ordered:\n~ Creme brulee: served in what looked like a soup cup! This resulted in less surface area for the burnt sugar on top and quite a thick layer of egg on the bottom. I'll bet a lot of customers just scrape off the sugar and leave the egg custard behind. ;) Normally it's served in a flatter dish, which is what I prefer.\n~ Chocolate gourmand: basically a warm chocolate cake, and what looked like the best of the three desserts.", "author": "Audrey L."}

I was really excited because the menu had course choices, and they all looked good.\n\nMaybe I just chose the wrong items.  I started with the dungeness crab napoleon [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=hMUA1c5YlXbPYXi73G2_0Q], which was amazing.  Since our friends were almost 30 minutes late, and it took another 20 minutes to order, I wolfed the dish down like no other.\n\nI had heard good things about the duck confit [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=BfI-8q-XtPgtb2n8Xye_Yg].  Sadly, my experience was less than stellar.  It was dry, overcooked, and almost, just almost inedible.  But, I was still really hungry.  So, wolfed it down too.\n\nI wish the saving grace was the dessert, but alas, the vanilla bean creme brulee [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ug9a63OBRBje0796bFFPgA?select=RX0kCZzB9EEhOLPbt4L2_g] was nothing special.\n\nOverall, the dining experience fell short of expectations.", "author": "Jenny L."}

Fringale is tucked away just a couple blocks from the Metreon area.  It's almost right by the freeway.  So its a nice quiet place to have dinner without the hustle and bustle of the city.  The food is a little bit above a moderate price level but not in the overly expensive zone.  Let's take a tour of our meal!\n\nOur starter.. Dungeness crab Napoleon with avocado, tomato confit and cr\u00e8me fraiche. Totally incredible balance of flavors. Wonderfully light. The mixed green salad gave it just the hint of bitter and acidity to balance the richness of the crab and avocado.  Also, the caviar on top gave it just the extra kick to take it up a notch!\n\nHangar steak with pomme frites and green beans.  Classically done.  It doesn't try to pretend to be anything it's not and it does what it does very well.  The fries were crisp, the haricots verts were crunchy, and the steak was juicy.\n\nHazelnut mousse cake.  A little bit heavy because of all the flavors and richness- but it's very well done.  I love the combination of the aromatic hazelnuts with the creamy mouse and the dense dark chocolate. \n\nCreme Brulee.  Not much to say other than it was executed and delicious.  A true mark of a well run French restaurant.\n\nThat about sums up Fringale.  Small and cozy, a few steps away from the city, it is well executed French food at a moderate price.", "author": "Siao J."}

Well, things seem to have changed. We both ordered the same dish last Saturday evening: the braised veal short ribs with leeks, potato galette, carrots & mushroom fricassee with demi-glaze sauce. There was no there there. The meat was virtually non-existent. All fatty stuff and bone. The underlayment of the galette and fricassee turned into mush. Amazingly poor dish. And, the service was sub par at best. The kicker is that these dishes were $29 apiece! We felt we had been ripped off. Big disappointment. Someone must not be minding the store, or the kitchen, or whatever. I am really tired of paying inflated prices and getting skewered (pun intended). Probably won't go back.", "author": "Jackson F."}

Reservations were a breeze to make on Opentable and the owner/manager greeted us warmly at the door. The only downside to this place was that they insisted that they had no 7:30 reservations or 7:45 reservations, yet half of the restaurant was empty when we walked in at 7:40... Minus one star for not keeping tabs of their tables and reservations since after the hoopla on the phone during the reservation making process, our table was empty and waiting for us at 7:40!\n\nWe ordered a variety of apps from the DAT menu: sauteed calamari and the crab napolean. Both were delicious... my crab napolean ended up having a large hunk of crab shell in it. It wasn't a typical small gritty piece but a 2 inch long one. I showed it to the waitress when she came around since that would have been an easy catch by the prep staff. \n\nI had the duck confit and Hubsters had the lamb. Lamb won over the duck. I think I prefer my duck peking style with a nice crisp skin and some buns. Their version of duck confit was done really well. The skin was crisp and crackling. The lentils that accompanied the duck was mediocre. The menu advertised it with bacon and I saw the occasional smidgen of bacon in there.\n\nDessert was delicious. I had the hazelnut mousse cake, Hubster ordered the molten chocolate cake. MMMMmmm... We had to rush through dessert in order to catch our train back down since the service here was extremely slow.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA) of SOMA.  They both serve reasonably priced French cuisine with portion size for humans, not birds.  One difference is that Fringale focuses on Basque cuisine, which has lots of seafood with Spanish influences.  I wasn't wowed by their food, but it was certainly above average.  This is a good place to remember if you need to take someone to a French restaurant.       \n\nSEATS:  A medium size restaurant with 20-30 tables.  They have tables that fold out to make a square table into a round table, so they are pretty flexible.  Spacing was tight.\n\nPRICE:  I would not call dinner here cheap, but for French, it is reasonable.\n\nA sample dinner for two:\n$18 - Seafood Basquaise\n$18 - Pork tenderloin\n$6 - Spinach and Roquefort\n$6 - Potato gratin\n$22 - A half bottle of wine\n$18 - Tip and taxes\n--------------------------------\n$88 for two people\n\nPARKING:  Unless there is a Giant's home game at AT&T park, parking during dinner hours in this SOMA area is fairly easy.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

I think I was by far the happiest with my selections. \n\nThe calamari and crab napoleon were a tie for me. \n\nThe Crab Napoleon was clean, and very refreshing. Dressed with layers of guacamole, mango salsa and farmers greens, I kept alternating bites of calamari and this!\n\nThe Calamari was just so different! I was expecting fried calamari with jalape\u00f1o but it wasn't like that at all. It was a huge plate of sauteed calamari and it was really tasty. \n\nMy lamb shank was amazing. I didn't have to use my knife at all and the meat just fell off it's bone. It was paired with a polenta, spinach and oyster mushrooms that went really well with the lamb!! This was by far the best lamb I've had that didn't get too game-y or too mushy (usually, at other places I've been to, the lamb comes with risotto that makes it too mushy). \n\nThe sole and duck were pretty disappointing. Like someone warned below, the duck is pretty dry.\n\nFor dessert, I really loved the Chocolate Gourmand.  It was like a flourless rich chocolate cake that was fluffy and scrumptious topped with ice cream!\n\n The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was a good choice too. \n\nHazelnut almond cake and Coffee parfait were my least favorite, first one was just pretty much hazelnut creme and the second one tasted like alcohol (Which can be a good thing), but I just wanted something savory and sweet. \n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by Fringale, maybe because I came in not knowing what to expect, but I thhink all their dishes were well thought out and paired well.

Although Fringale is a small restaurant (prob. can't fit more than 30 if even), I never once felt squished, but instead, felt like I was in France (reminiscing my most recent trip to France).\n\nFOOD: \n+ Braised veal short ribs -- Yum yum yum! The ribs felt like they were braised for hours -- they easily melted off of the bone into your mouth. It really didn't take much to chew on them at all! I never had such tender veal before. I really liked the sauce that came with it - it was a tomato puree that although very acidic, didn't actually taste too heavy and went very well the leeks and mushrooms.\n\n+ Duck confit - The duck was perfectly crisp on the outside, yet so tender and silky smooth. I usually don't eat lentils, but they were cooked till they were very soft and complimented the duck. My only complaint was that sometimes the duck felt a bit dry -- maybe a bit overcooked to get that crisp on the outside?\n\n+ Spicy calamari - Definitely on the spicy side. Calamari was very very fresh, chewy, and didn't have that seafood fishy-ness to it at all! Liked the addition of the peppers, and how it was just all grilled in olive oil. Must eat hot though, or else the olive oil starts to sit on the bottom. \n\nSERVICE:\nExcellent! I was waiting for my friend for a good 30 minutes, but the waiter never shot me a weird look for not ordering anything, instead, came by twice to ask if I wanted any water or appetizer to start off with. He was also very knowledgable about the whole menu when we had questions, and periodically stopped by during service to take away our plates and ask how our food was.\n\n****BIG TIP: Frenchies are known to have long 2 hour dinners, because they never rush you to eat. So that means as long as you have your appetizer unfinished still on the table, they won't serve you your entree, even if it's ready in the back. We waited for our entrees for awhile, kind of confused about the slow service, and then our server finally asked if we wanted our entrees to come out. Oopsies! So remember to tell them to just have the food come out when it's ready or else you'll be waiting for your food forever!", "author": "Evelyn S."}

It boosts a FOUR STAR rating on YELP, so how bad could it be?

It was too tangy and overpowered the mussels. \n\n*DAT MENU ($34.95)\n-Spicy Calamari w/ Jalape\u00f1o and Chorizo: Eeeck! This basically was like a Chinese stir-fry type dish. The calamari was tender, but a bit chewy. I hate olives and I didn't know it was served w/ it. The olives were pungent and overpowered the entire dish. Chorizo? What chorizo? I carefully combed through the entire dish and found none. \n\n-Filet Mignon w/ Frites: It was ok. A filet is my fav cut of meat and I can say, the quality of the filet was quite poor. Although it was cooked medium rare, it was tough and chewy, and tasted more like a beef \"tenderloin\". Ummm, at least it was well-seasoned? The frites was very crisp and light, so no complaints there.\n\n-Hazelnut and Roasted Almond Mousse cake: I wasn't too fond of this dessert. The were 2 layers of cake filled with hazelnut mousse. The cake was dense, dry and the mousse didn't have much hazelnut flavor to it. The best part was the roasted almond slices and chocolate sauce. \n\nSERVICE:\nI totally agree with Anna T; the service at Fringale is pretentious, rude, and not attentive, to the \"younger\" crowd at least. The place wasn't even busy and it took a while for our waiter to even come and take out order who had a very uptight and condescending attitude. I asked him for wine recommendations and he just pointed to the most expensive one. I don't mind paying for good food and drinks, but it would help if he explained WHY he recommends it. \n\nThe staff is completely unorganized and was running back and forth w/ dishes, not knowing what table ordered what. Then, as they passed through the tables, they kept on bumping into my chair and the lady in back of me w/ no apologies. \n\nOur waiter only checked in w/ us once towards the ends of our meal; mind you, this place is TINY and it wasn't crowded. I'm not asking for the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, but if you're going to ask others how they are doing multiple times, you need to be consistent and make sure ALL your customers are doing ok. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nFringale is \"cozy\" w/ a max capacity of about 40 in the main dining area. It has a very \"fresh\" vibe w/ the bright yellow walls, crisp white linen tables, and auburn furnishings. B/c it's a very small area and the tables are crammed close to each other, it can be quite difficult to hold an intimate conversation.\n\nPARKING:\nStreet parking which is easy after 6 PM on a non-game night.\n\nLooking for a true French bistro experience at reasonable prices? I highly recommend going to Chapeau instead where the Executive Chef and staff welcome you w/ open arms, the food is delectable, and the ambiance is classy and intimate. \n\nSorry Fringale, you FAIL when it comes to having the \"urge to eat\" at your establishment...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Fringale's DAT menu is VERY good.  You have great choices.  As I sat there, skimming my options, I had difficulty narrowing it down.  I wanted everything.  \n\nFor January 2010 DAT, they've got 3 excellent choices for each course, and might I add that each course comes in a generous portion = WIN:\nApps: mussels, charcuterie, or dungeness crab ravioli\nEntrees: coq au vin, filet mignon, or petrale sole\nDesserts: warm chocolate gourmand, creme brulee, or an almond and hazelnut mousse cake\n\nMy meal of crab ravioli, coq au vin, and creme brulee was solid all the way through.  The crab ravioli in lobster bisque was some of the best I've ever had.  Flavorful, hearty, and good portions too.  The coq au vin was oh-so-tender, meat fell off the bones, though it was a tad bit salty for my taste.  Subtract a star.  The creme brulee was fantastic.  Too bad I don't like sweet things because I ended up only eating half of it, and giving the rest of it to one of my foodmates.  But seriously, it was a very well-made creme brulee, and it's apparently what they're known for.  \n\nI love classy-casual restaurants, and Fringale's definitely one of those. One of my friends came decked out in a full suit, and another foodmate arrived, fresh from a basketball game, in a bright green t-shirt with rabbits all over it.  Awesome.  I love it.  Suit, t-shirt, and everything in between works.  Although if I were you, I would opt for something in between a suit and a green rabbit t-shirt.  But hey, whatever works!  \n\nSo, yeah, the atmosphere was really cozy and casual, though at times I thought it was odd that the lighting kept flickering between light and dark.  Maybe there's something wrong with my eyes.  \n\nService was also excellent.  Our waiter kept refilling our bread basket (good bread, by the way) and our waters.  That's the way I like it.  Getting stuffed on carbs and hydrated on H20 in between courses.  Good stuff.\n\nEveryone else in our party of 7 enjoyed their meals, and this place seems like one of the better DAT deals.  I don't know about you, but for me, it was intimidating seeing that entire list of DAT restaurants and figuring out which one(s) to choose.  I mean, you don't want to go wrong and plop down $40+ on lackluster food, right? \n\nWell, Fringale's a good bet.

You may notice that I've still given it four stars - that's because even though I've had better, Fringale was still very good!\n\nA few friends and I came for Dine About Town, though after looking at the menu you can definitely get a great three course dinner under $40 on a regular night.\n\nFor my appetizer, I tried the calamari, which wasn't very memorable.  It was an impressively large plate of calamari, but that was about it.  The flavors were bland to salty, and the texture was rubbery instead of that great calamari crunch.\n\nThe duck confit was out of this world!  The best duck confit I've ever had - it really elevated this meal.  The meat was falling off the bone, lentils sitting in delicious sauce, and I think there must have been some bacon in there.  Really, really fantastic.\n\nUnfortunately the duck confit had to end and then came the creme brulee for dessert.  If creme brulee is on the dessert menu, there's a 85% chance I will order it.  Love the stuff.  Fringale's creme brulee, however, left my scratching my head.  You know when you're at a casual restaurant and you have the option of either a cup or bowl of soup?  Imagine that cup firmly in your mind.  That is what my creme brulee came in.  It was deep, it was narrow, and it had a terrible creme-to-carmelized goodness ratio.\n\nSo, really, only one of my three courses warrants a rating above two or three stars.

The most memorable ones for me were the Crab Salad and the Calamari.  The calamari wasn't at all what I expected.  Better than I expected I have to clarify.  I was sort of sauteed and not deep fried like I normally would see elsewhere.\n\nFor entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Duck Confit.  The duck meat just stripped right off the bone.  Very tasty.  I had a bite of my friend's sea bass dish which was also so yummy!\n\nI had Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fblee for dessert, which was creamy and not to sweet at all.  Just the perfect amount of sweetness, the way I like it.\n\nThe waiter at our table was a french guy who was kind and charming.  Three out of us five study french and we were able to speak to him in french a little and he just kindly responded back to us in french too.  No attitude at all even though I'm sure we probably didn't say everything correctly.\n\nFringale isn't a big place, but the seatings are set in the way that accommodate all parties well.  There wasn't a time when we had to yell because the conversation from other tables were interfering ours at all.  Very intimate within my group even when other groups weren't too far from us.  Wonderful experience and will definitely come back again soon.", "author": "Joe C."}

(Fringale will be on your right on 4th street, which is a one-way street.)\n\nAbout that inspiring food:\nButter lettuce salad tasted like it was picked that day.\nThe duck confit (medium rare) was moist, only slightly gamey (just enough to be tasty but not overwhelming).\nThe flavor of the vegetables in the couscous \"popped\" against the canvas of couscous. (Now I realize how fennel is meant to be used :-)\nRack of lamb has a beautiful display. We made a mistake and ordered it well done (which it was) but that made it tough and next time, I would order it medium rare. It came with perfectly blanched green beans. It came with a potato-and-cheese (Gruyere) gratin which was different (and delicious) in that it was more like a personal pancake than a slice of casserole. \nCreme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was a generous serving, and had the wonderful richness of eggs, cream, and vanilla.

This is the first time I've been to a French restaurant. Servers are very friendly and welcoming.\n\nAppetizers: \nI got the Spicy Monterey calamari \"a la plancha\". Very good. Not over cooked. Not too spicy. For once I ate a calamari appetizer that wasn't deep fried. +1 for the jalapenos in the dish.\nThe wife got the dungeness crab napoleon, avocado, lemon zest, piquillo peppers, & mango salsa. This was GOOD. I honestly like this one better than mine. Crab was abundant and tasted fresh. The avocado and crab went well together. My first time trying that combo. The wife loved it.\n\nMain Course:\nI got the Traditional duck confit, lentils \"Du Puy\", potatoes Landaises, garlic, bacon & red wine sauce. The duck was cooked to perfection. Meat fell off the bones. The garlic and bacon went well with the taste of the duck fat. I could tell the bacon fat was used to cook the potatoes. That's another +1 in my book.\n\nWife got the fish...unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the dish. It's currently not on their website. It tasted good though. The risotto the fish was placed on was moist, not dry. \n\nDesserts were pretty much standard. Overall, the wife and I had a good time.

They were a bit overwhelmed because it was prime dinner time (around 8pm) and they were clearly having more customers than they anticipated. So we had to wait for some 20-30 minutes, which we used to wash down some delicious Rioja and Bordeaux at the bar. The place is small, maybe a dozen tables total, and let's say cozy, but not uncomfortably so. Not too noisy either, so you could have a pleasant conversation while dining or waiting to be served.\n\nAnd now to the food. We had the DaT prix fixe menu, which had 3 choices for appetizers, entree and dessert. I started with the grilled calamari, packing a bit of a spice punch (unexpected at a French place, but pleasant), and she had the dungeness crab patties, which was superior in my opinion. The layered avocado and cabbage made it a winner, simple and refreshing. Then she followed with the sole over risotto, which was pretty good if not spectacular, but I had the most amazing lamb shank I remember in a long time. The meat was a tad crunchy on the outside, juicy and extra tender inside. I'm still salivating over that. Finally, I had the coffee mousse for dessert (yummy, but forgettable), while she had the chocolate gourmand, clearly a better choice (I would have gone for it if she hadn't ordered it first, since we wanted to try different things).\n\nI would like to say I'll be back soon, but Fringale is on the pricey side for us. We'll definitely return next time there's a deal like this, or perhaps on a special occasion.", "author": "Pablo D."}

To start, we had a very interesting asparagus veloute as an \"amuse bouche\". My appetizer of oysters was a bit underwhelming, but not terrible. The oysters themselves were on the smaller side, and I much prefer the larger varieties. However my main of seared scallops with risotto was absolutely amazing. Seriously an ideal dish for me and one of the best dishes I have ever tasted - I wish I could go back and order it again. Finally, my dessert, a sorbet trio including a peach chardonnay sorbet, was light and refreshing and really delicious. \n\nThe service was wonderful and polished and the atmosphere was elegant and sophisticated. My only minor complaint is the tables are crammed together because space is at a premium when the restaurant is busy.

He briefed us the daily special, but we decided to go with other dishes.  And here are what we ordered:\n\nAppetizers:\n\n1.  FOIE GRAS TERRINE.  Loved it.  They substituted the pineapple chutney with black mission figs instead.  When we make foie gras at home, we use figs jam too.  With the sea salt and cayenne pepper and toasted brioche, this definitely is one of my favorite appetizers.\n\n2.  SPICY MONTEREY CALAMARI.  This tasted more like a Spanish tapas to me, but it's very delicious.  The right amount of spiciness induced my appetite.  It's a big plate for an appetizer!\n\nEntrees:\n\n1.  ROASTED RACK OF LAMB.  Tender meat, perfect medium, but only two bones!  But with the potato gratin, it's pretty filling.\n\n2.  STEAMED ALASKAN HALIBUT.  I rarely order fish, but I was looking for a light meal so this entree was perfect for me.  Too bad I didn't like it much, the fish was kind of overcooked, and the vinaigrette didn't help to bring out the flavor of the fish.  I guess I like grilled fish more.  But if you check out the picture, this dish had a very nice presentation.\n\nDessert:\n\nWe shared the POACHED PEACH WITH TOASTED ALMONDS AND CREAM.

Their DAT menu has some decent choices, with three options per course.\n\nFirst course: \nSpicy calamari: this was really yummy. It wasn't a typical breaded and fried calamari. It was simply pan-fried with olives, jalapenos, and a lot of spicy powder. The calamari was really tender and a bit chewy, it was spicy but not overly so. I enjoyed it.\n\nBasil, roquefort, spinach ravioli: four delicate ravioli with paper-thin wrapping. There's spinach inside and a roquefort cream as a topping. There's also some basil and pine nuts scattered on top. I love cheese and this had a strong blue cheese flavor, which was very satisfying.\n\nSecond course:\nLamb shank: I got a HUGE lamb shank on a big bone. The lamb was fork-tender and flavorful. It was accompanied with polenta, which was kind of tasteless... but also some king trumpet mushrooms, which I really enjoyed. Probably the best entree for DAT (although I didn't try any others)\n\nThird course:\nHazelnut almond cake: I really liked this. Kind of a joconde cake layered with hazelnut buttercream and a generous topping of sliced almonds on top. I like nutty desserts so this was great.\n\nCoffee parfait: basically this was frozen cream with strong coffee flavor. It was nice but I preferred the cake (although my friend preferred the parfait- perfect!)\n\nWe also got a half bottle of Chinon, which was surprisingly a very nice red wine.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, which was solid French bistro fare. The service was decent (and very French!!) However, the interior is nothing special and the tables were SO close together that every time I left my seat I would have to literally squeeze past the neighboring table very intimately, which was kind of embarrassing considering my neighbors were having an intense business dinner meeting!", "author": "Cathy S."}

We had four bottles of wine, about 8 appetizers, 14 entrees, and 7 desserts, and the bill only came out to about $860.\n\nThe ambiance is more cozy and intimate, but not necessarily romantic. At least it didn't feel particularly romantic to me. \n\nThe food and menu are self-proclaimed French, but I thought there were some not so French-y things in the accoutrements of the dishes, such as balsamic vinegar all over my onion tarte and capers in my friend's salad. \n\nAll of the appetizers I tried were pretty delicious. The terrine of foie gras, onion tart, charcuterie assortment (assiette) were the special standouts. I thought the foie gras was just pate, and I felt so guilty afterwards. :( Sorry, duckies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the roast chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The chicken was very moist but it needed a sauce to bring the dish all together. Whatever sauce was on the plate was not enough for me, but maybe i'm too saucy! Haaaa.\n\nAnyway, my husband had the rabbit, which was a special of that night, and the dish was pretty good but maybe it was so well-seasoned and sauced, that you could not taste the rabbit? \n\nEither way, the food was pretty good, but there is room for some improvement. \n\nDessert was pretty yummy, the hazelnut cake and warm chocolate gourmand are highly recommended. So gooooooood. \n\nService was really nice. Our server was really patient with our group of 12, some of whom did not know what to order and what wines went best with what entrees/appetizers. I did not drink, so that wasn't a big deal for me that night. \n\nLoved my experience here.", "author": "Anh D."}

We sat at a round table in the middle of the restaurant and I felt somewhat claustrophobic.\n\nWe all ordered the same appetizers and entrees because we couldn't bear to share what we were about to order! We all got the dungeness crab ravioli as our appetizer. It didn't come with that many pieces (about five?), but there was a lot of crab inside the ravioli, so it was still decently filling. It also wasn't covered in sauce like it tends to be at some restaurants, which was a nice change so that I could actually taste the crab. The wrap for the ravioli was pretty interesting and made it taste more Asian; it tasted slightly like a wonton wrapper. That wasn't anything negative, but just unexpected. I would get this again.\n\nWe all got the filet mignon. I asked for mine to be cooked medium-rare and it was absolutely perfect! However, one of my friends also asked for medium-rare and his was cooked to more of a medium level. He didn't seem to get full satisfaction out of the meal until he finished his and I gave him some of mine because I was so full. He really loved my filet mignon (which was cooked more to his liking), but minus points for not cooking it consistently. Also, another one of my friends didn't hear the waiter when he asked how she wanted her filet mignon cooked, and she didn't respond, so they made hers a lot more rare than she had wanted. However, they took it back to the kitchen and gave her another one that she was more satisfied with.\n\nWe all got different desserts. I ordered the hazelnut and roasted almond mousse cake, which was amazing! It had the perfect balance of hazelnut, mousse, and chocolate underneath. The thinly sliced almonds also gave it a good texture with a slight crunch, which was a nice contrast to the smooth and creamy cake itself. Some people got the creme brulee, which was pretty good, but I've had better. I also got to try my friend's chocolate gourmand, which is basically a warm chocolate souffle/cake that came with ice cream and raspberry sauce. I wasn't a huge fan, although I normally love that kind of dessert. I would recommend the hazelnut cake out of the three desserts that they offered.\n\nParking was really easy, so that wasn't an issue -- I parked at a meter just down the street.\n\nDefinitely a worthwhile experience for Dine About Town!", "author": "Angela K."}

Is the demand and money THAT good? There was a scuffle behind our table when some arrogant older woman elbowed the man sitting basically on top of her, and pretended like it didn't happen. I dont blame these people! I wanted to sneak in a word about the man in front of me fresh out of the hospital, making a pile of food around his chair on the floor!

A smattering of a green delicious sauce-dressing and delicious hard cheese thinly sliced, all paired with wheat-style crusty bread. It may very well be the best salad we ever had. Plus they put it on two plates for us without us even asking. Mmm I can still taste it...\n\nEntrees - \nRibeye med-rare covered with a wine butter, frites and perfectly cooked skinny string beans. 5 stars hands down.\nVeal braised short ribs, with an exotic mushroom sauce, the best creamy polenta I have ever had topped over a delectable spinach,onion bottom. 5 stars no question.\n\nService was very polite, owner was gracious, everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their meals and sharing items with exclamation, no one was rushed at all. The food is heavy - it is French after all - but so worth it.\n\nFour stars only because they absolutely should have staffed one more person on the busy holiday evening. We waited a loooong time to sign our bill.\n\nThere is also a cute bar if you just wanted dessert. Evening sun shines on the windows, which makes for a cozy and romatic place. Nice table clothes & good vibes.\n\nI am so glad this is around the corner! We will be back.", "author": "AK S."}

Came up with Fringale and chose to come here for dinner. When we arrived, we waited a bit for a table even with reservations and 4 empty tables in the restaurant. I got the potato garlic soup and the pork tenderloin. The soup was soso while the   Bacon wrapped Pork tenderloin, braised savoy cabbage w/caramelized onion sauce was AMAZING. I have never had a piece of pork that was so soft, juicy and tender. The cabbage that came with it was a bit strange, but the meat and the sauce made up for it. We shared the creme brule which was also fantastic. \n\nMy only peeve was that they only had 1 choice for \"glass\" champagne. It was a french champagne that was about $20 for a glass. It seemed a lot for just one glass. A choice of moderately priced champagnes would have been nice. \n\nEasy parking if you get there early. Staff is questionable as service was slow at times.

Calamari was okay, not special so I don't remember much about it. \n\nEntrees: Duck confit, this was okay. I've had better though. Lamb, this was terrible.

Considering the amount of time spent in traffic, I was only 15 minutes late for my reservation and delighted to get street parking a block away from the restaurant.\n\nFringale was the choice for my 3-course DAT venture. Having looked at the prix-fixe menu beforehand, I was excited to sample what this French bistro had to offer. Seated promptly in this cozy place, I overlooked the menu to see if there were any changes to the menu from the one on the DAT website, of which there were none. \n\n-Sweet gem lettuce salad, herb vinaigrette, croutons with Basque cheese: Delicate, crisp lettuce leaves lightly coated with the tangy herb vinaigrette. Thin shavings of the creamy Basque cheese gave the salad a mild saltiness. Crispy croutons provided a nice textural contrast and gratefully were small in size. \n\n-Boeuf Bourguignon, fingerling potatoes, carrots, bacon with red wine jus: Essentially a French beef stew containing several pieces of slow cooked beef that falls apart when you cut it with a fork accompanied with vegetables which were still firm as you bit into them. The bacon was so subtle that I didn't know it was there. Disappointed about that. But the robust, hearty red wine jus was so good I had to abandon my bread limit and sop it up.\n\n-Warm chocolate Gourmand with macerated berries and vanilla ice cream: Perfect ending to the meal. Almost brownie-like but lighter and more moist. The various berries were macerated in red wine and were still structurally maintained. Enjoyed the cooling of the vanilla ice cream, the warm dark chocolate cake, and the soft berries coming together in each bite. Surprisingly, this dessert was not overly sweet at all. So good that I could have had 2 more plates.\n\nA few minor downsides:\n-Water wasn't refilled automatically without asking. I was patiently waiting for a refill that I had to munch on the ice for refreshment. Finally I couldn't wait any longer and had to ask.\n\n-After using the knife to cut up some large pieces of lettuce from the salad, I left it on the plate when I finished up the appetizer. I was expecting a new one to replace it. It was interesting to use my spare fork to spread butter on my bread. Finally, I had to ask for a replacement knife.\n\n-Some of the bread was downright chewy. Had to gnaw on it for quite a while to tear a piece off. Also it was room temperature. Bread is always better served hot or at least warm, in my opinion.\n\nHaving a delicious lunch here satisfied my \"fringale\". Though looking at the tower of PEI mussels (one of the other DAT entrees) served at an adjacent table almost brought it back again.\n\nOverall: 3.5 stars", "author": "Randy T."}

The blue cheese is overwhelming and takes away from the actual ravioli. I think I would have enjoyed it if not for the overwhelming blue cheese. My husband and my father in law got the calamari which was a lot better but I didn't think it was that flavorful.\n\nMain course, I got the duck confit. The only thing I liked about this dish was the mushrooms. The duck was too salty and dry- how disappointing. i understand that it's supposed to be cooked to fall-off-the-bone, but where's all the flavor from being cooked for hours?! \n\nMy father in law got the salmon. We thought it was going to be good since it looked like it was cooked perfectly but I think it was bland since he kept sprinkling salt on it (they must have used all the salt on my dish). \n\nMy mother in law got the lamb shank. Also not good and overcooked. She didn't even finish it since it was so bad. \n\nMy husband got the coque a vin which he enjoyed. \n\nDessert I got the Coffee & Armagna parfait - overwhelming coffee flavor. I believe there's a prune in there which was weird and sour. Husband got the creme brulee & Vanilla bean - nice vanilla flavor but too thick and not creamy enough for my taste. Father in law got the Hazelnut and Almond cake - he did not like. Not sure what my mother in law got because it wasn't on the menu but it was a chocolate cake with a sorbet on top. She liked the sorbet and ate all that. But took one bite of the chocolate cake and called it quits. So I gave a taste and it was gross.

We ordered the Foie Gras terrine, I do have to say I prefer the seared kind over terrine or torchon, but this livery goodness was buttery, rich and the pineapple compote was the perfect counterpart to this rich buttery flavor of the foie. \n\nThe summer endive salad was sweet and tart and just absolute yummyness in my tummyness! I just love crunchy and crisp endives with the creamy and mild goat cheese.\nAnother special of the day was the scallop and asparagus dish with a spicy garlic aioli drizzled on top.

Lives up to my French restaurant baguette expectations. NOMS. \n\nDungeness Crab Napoleon. Crab with Avocado, Mango Salsa and fresh Veggies topped with freshly ground Black Pepper. NOMS. I liked this a lot, it was very fresh and delicious. The tangy and sweet mango salsa complemented the oceany crab very well. I also liked all the different textures in it, especially the creamy avocado in the crab. \n\nSpicy Monterey Calamari ala Plancha. With Jalapenos, Chorizo and Olives. Not spicy at all! But it was really yummy, I liked that it wasn't fried because it's healthier. Definitely worth it even though I wish it was spicier. I even ate the peppers and I didn't taste any spice at all. \n\nRoquefort and Spinach Ravioli. With Toasted Pine Nuts, Basil and Cream Sauce. YUMS. I remember learning way back in my second year of college about roquefort and it's stench. And I was expecting worse, but I liked this a lot even though I'm not a fan of blue cheese, it kind of had a similar aroma to it, but fortunately I wasn't too bothered by it. Though this was cheesy and creamy, I was surprised to find it not the least bit heavy. DELISH!\n\nTraditional Coq Au Vin. Chicken in Red Wine Sauce (I believe) with Mushrooms and Veggies. I usually don't like eating chicken at restaurants because I find it made tough and chewy, but I liked this chicken a lot. It was really tender and literally fell off the bone. I also liked the wine sauce a lot, gave the chicken even more flavor when I had it as leftovers the day after. \n\nPetrale Sole. With Mashed Potatoes, Carrots, Zucchini and Piquillo Pepper Beurre Blan. This was alright, it was more like a stuffed sole or julienned carrots/zucchini wrapped with sole. Very interesting nonetheless, but nothing to write home about. I thought this could have been better flavorwise since it was more on the bland side, especially after eating my own wine-strong flavored coq au vin.\n\nLamb Shank. With Mashed Potatoes and Veggies. NOMS. This was really good, the lamb was nice and tender and fell off the bone as well. Very yummy, definitely gotta try the rack of lamb next time, I saw a lot of people ordering that even though it wasn't on the DAT menu. \n\nCreme Brulee. With a Blackberry and a Raspberry. I thought this was alright, they definitely put real vanilla beans in it because I saw the flecks, so I appreciated that. And they toasted the sugar to a nice almost burnt, but caramelized consistency which I liked also. It was pretty good, though I must admit I'm not really a fan of ordering this or chocolate lava cake at restaurants since I can make it myself at home. \n\nCoffee Parfait. With Prune and Cookie. My mom and I both got this because we didn't feel like getting a rich chocolate cake since we were so full. This was alright, very strong on the alcohol. Definitely was not a fan of this. I only ended up getting this because they switched out the menus on us and when we were waiting for our table it had the Hazelnut and Almond Mousse Cake on it. SADFACE. \n\nI also ended up getting the Coq Au Vin because the Duck Confit was no longer on the menu when we got to our table. I was uber sad they switched the menu on us. So foodies beware, what you see initially may not be what you can order later on. And note, we did have reservations so I'm not sure why exactly what we intended to order could have run out. \n\n3 stars only because though food was pretty good and by itself would have warranted 4 stars, but the service was lacking and the fact that they switched the menu on us wasn't cool.", "author": "Constance C."}

The bay scallops were just okay, the chicken meat from the coq au vin was old and tasted something I could make without too much effort. My black cod was the best entree dish of the night, but it's pretty difficult to get black cod wrong.

My wife & I came to San Francisco for a long weekend/birthday celebration. For a restaurant for dinner on Sunday evening (Mother's Day) we asked friends and Fringale was one that was suggested.  Fringale was convenient to our hotel (Marriott on 4th St.), was well rated on Yelp and had reservations available when we needed them (7:30 pm on a Sunday). Being a bit off the beaten path and not the usual tourist hangout was a plus. \n\nWe walked the 4 blocks from the hotel and were seated within moments of our arrival. The good service we expected began right away.   My salad included lettuce, mango, papaya and shaved Parmesan followed by an entree of bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, braised Napa cabbage, onion & apple marmalade; outstanding! \n\nThe wife's salad included Fava beans, artichokes, carrots...and I don't remember the rest but she described it as wonderful. Her entree, poached black cod, potato puree, piperade, artichokes, capers & olive tapenade she described as delicious.  We shared a side of green beans that were perfectly cooked and just lightly seasoned.  Of course we had to have dessert, it's Mother's Day.  The warm chocolate gourmand flourless chocolate cake was the topper...yummm.\n\nOur waiter was a very efficient, pleasant and knowledgeable young fellow named Sam who managed the flow of food and beverages perfectly and was very helpful in selecting the perfect bottle of wine. \n\nThe dining room is small with one side occupied by a small bar area. The neighborhood is an odd mix of old and new, commercial and apartments in the SOMA area.  Looks to be a short distance from AT&T Park.

Quite near my office, this is one of the first San Francisco restaurants that I truly looked forward to visiting again and again after relocating here from New York in 2003. I am not alone in that. Usually this place is very crowded, and for good reason.\n\nFringale is a smallish Basque inspired French bistro in the heart of the South of Market neighborhood on Fourth Street near Brannan. According to their web site, the name means \"the urge to eat.\" It has a contemporary, understated interior; white linens covered in crisp white paper with elegant white dishes and gleaming flatware; and a small, chic open bar by the entrance. To me the restaurant always feels warm and inviting. The walls are adorned with abstract art from local artists, which changes periodically and is often for sale.\n\nThe ingredients are always fresh; service is good; staff are efficient, pleasant without being intrusive, and what I like the most, clearly know the menu. The day that we were there, a special soup du jour of roasted butternut squash was on the menu. Our waitperson described the ingredients of the soup and specifically noted that it was made with chicken stock without needing to be asked. In my opinion, it is the little things like this that make a good place great.\n\nRead the full blog article here:\nhttp://weirdcombinations.com/2011/01/fringale-restaurant-san-francisco/", "author": "Jerome, Jerome T."}

I visited this cozy-looking basque/french restaurant with a party of eleven. We made our reservation here (as opposed to the eight zillion other great restaurants in the area) because when we called ahead, they assured us that they could meet my friend's strict dietary needs. Not only did they not listen carefully to her order (plain chicken breast with no oil, no seasoning and plain steamed veggies), but they managed to mess it up three times. How embarrassing for her and how awkward as we had our food long before she did. Eventually, she was given a plate of green beans. \n\nAs for the rest of us, the food was amazing. (Whatever they do for their interesting dressing on the gem salad- it's magical.) Several folks ordered the evening's prix fix, while others opted for various a la carte choices. It takes a lot for a plate of mac & cheese to be worth the $18 they charge... but let me tell you, it was fan-freakin-tastic. Everyone enjoyed their food and the desserts were no exception.\n\nUnfortunately, we all walked out furious. In addition to the screw up with my friend's green bean extravaganza, they also treated her as though she was a lower class citizen. In fact, we all felt pretty disgusted with the snooty treatment we received. When we walked in on time for our reservation, they acted as though we were putting them out and made us stand awkwardly while they pulled tables together for us. Compliments we gave about the food were met with... nothing. Just brisk, cold snobbery.. (And we were a fun group!) When our bill came, we were met with another surprise. They charged everyone for dessert... even those who'd ordered prix fix (dessert included). We missed our train due to the time we wasted trying to get our bill adjusted to the correct amount. We finally gave up and left. And then went to Bar Basic down the street to hang out and wait for the next train... and wonder together at how much of the waiter's spit we'd all ingested that night at Fringale.\n\nIt pains me to give this place two stars, as I'd really rather give them one, but I must admit that the food was pretty great.

Again and again, my friends are discriminated against because we look young.  Oh PLEASE I'll bet we tip more generously than half the old geezers up in that joint.  They made us stand there for like a good five minutes until seating us despite the fact that we had a reservation.  No one smiled, no warm welcome, just wait at the door.  Chapeau! is totally different; everyone there is warm, talkative, and charming despite the fact that we are young adults.  \n\nWe went with the Dine About Town Menu and damn were we disappointed.  Seriously?!? My friend's soup wasn't very tasty or savory and my other friend's salad was seriously just greens and like a handful of diced tomatoes.  Simplicity can be great, but in this case it just sucked.  My pate was good, but probably the only good thing there. \n\nThe beef bourguignon was so salty.  No one enjoyed that at all.  The salmon with risotto was so freaking dry.  I've never had salmon that was so dry and bland before.  It tasted decent mixed with the risotto, but it was so disappointing to have dry salmon.  I can seriously make better salmon, and that is sad.\n\nThe vibe of Fringale was just pretentious for food that was not even delicious.  Don't go here because their service is cold and inattentive, bordering rude half the time.  They need to stop hating on young people because we are going to grow up to be your next generation of wealthy yuppies that patronize your establishment.  Go to Chapeau where everyone is friendly, your water gets filled constantly, and the food is delicious!", "author": "Anna T."}

It took over 20 minutes for the waiter to even approach our table once we sat down. We didn't even get water. And when he came over finally he asked if we were ready to order. He didn't take a drink order or even go over any specials. They had a board next to the front door and it said specials and listed some wines below. We asked about if one on the list was available and the waiter said the list was old and hadn't been updated in days. Really? Then why have it?\n\nIn a city like SF with great dining options I wouldn't go back unless the service improves. Too bad because the place was cute and the meal was good.", "author": "Sam B."}

It was busy, and besides,who expects French waiters to be friendly?\n\nThe quality and flavors of our meals were good.  Quantity, not so much, but again, this is par for the French course.\n\nDesserts were generally very good, except for the strange \"floater\" at the top of my creme brulee.  Props to the waiter for noticing me staring at it, and he took it back.  However,  he either cleaned it off or then there are two identically cracked bowls there, because the crack was in the exact same spot.  \n\nI convinced myself that perhaps they pulled the top layer off and reflamed it.  Except it wasn't warm when it came back to me.\nYeah, I ate it anyway.  You really think I was going to leave dessert on the table?\n\nI would return if I were looking for reasonably priced French cuisine.\n\nOne note - we didn't get the promised free bottle of Pellegrino.

We took a while to look through the menu and pick out a wine, but food came out pretty quickly after that. The bread, wine, and water came out after we ordered. Bread was warm and soft, with a yummy crust. \n\nWas starting to fill up on bread when my crab napoleon came out. 2 layers of crab, with an avocado mixture in the middle, and a mango salsa on top. Pretty good, though I felt like there was a slightly overpowering taste to it... maybe the mayo? Next on my menu was the lamb shank on top of polenta and bed of spinach. Lamb was tender, easy to get off the bone, and the portion size was pretty big. I stuffed myself because there wasn't enough to take home (or so I say....). There was a slight wait between main course and dessert, but that helped the digestion process. And it was by dessert that we figured out we were given 2 different menus! Haha, but only 2 of the desserts were different. Instead of the hazelnut almond mousse, creme brulee was listed on my menu, but I was really glad because I loved it. A strong vanilla flavor, and the caramelized sugar was deeeelicious. Mmm... I want more just thinking about it...\n\n2 cool side notes:\n1) All the waiters there spoke French to each other.

Nice atmosphere,and for the city, easy to park.  \n\nThe food - generally quite good.  Not fabulous, but solid for most of the food.  Great cheese plate, great charcuterie plate, great appetizer ravioli, but the calamari from two tables away smelled fishy, so glad we didn't order that.  The pomme frites were a bit ho-hum.\n\nMy husband's roast chicken had an AMAZING skin on it.  Very good dish.  The steak was good, the spinach and gorgonzola side was wonderful.  Drink was tasty, wine pleasant... yes, yes, it almost was all great.\n\nUntil we got to my dish.  The pasta.  Alright, I get it, what was I thinking ordering pasta in a basque-esque restaurant?  I was thinking I didn't want a big hunk of meat for dinner.  And that it was on the menu.  So I ordered the vegetarian entree.  It was barely cooked, dry, sticky rigatoni with barely anything on top.  It was an insult to pasta.  An insult to the rest of the meal.  An EMBARASSMENT.  Should I have sent it back?  I don't know.  I really didn't think they could do anything else to make it better - there WAS NO SAUCE.  The dish was a poorly designed and badly executed travesty.  So what to do?  Sadly, in my case, not return.  \n\nWhich is a shame because I thought it was definitely do-able until that point.  But the entree is the main dish.

Based on everything I tasted,  I think a little salt could have been used to heighten the flavor but overall everything was cooked extremely well. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Dungeness Crab Ravioli in a Lobster Bisque- this smelled heavenly as it was placed in front of me; however, in tasting it, I thought it was just ok\n- Mussels in a savory broth with fried garlic pices- delicious- highly recommended and my pick out of the two I tried.\n* I highly recommend sopping up the sauce from both dishes with the bread- yum!\n\nEntrees:\n- Filet mignon- Cooked perfectly but definitely needed some kind of seasoning. I enjoyed the salad that was served with it and the potatoes were a fave of my fellow diners\n- Coq au vin- I love when chicken is so tender it falls off the bone, which is exactly what this did. More flavorful than the steak and I thought it was cooked extremely well.\n\nDessert:\n- Hazelnut cake- It was ok\n- Wam chocolate cake with ice cream- nothing new nor special\n- Creme Brulee- Probably the best out of the 3\n\nThe restaurant itself was extremely cute and the service was good. I appreciated the waiter cracking jokes with us and not minding our rambunctious bunch. I'd definitely say it's a great place to take a date because of the romantic ambiance. \n\nFor the DAT meal and a bottle of wine split amongst five (Saint Josephs, I believe was the name of the one we got) including tax and tip, it was approximately $55 per person.\n\nFor parking there's plenty of street parking nearby so I don't think it should be that hard to find a spot.\n\nFYI: Double check your bill at the end, they charged us for 6 instead of 5 and I know it was an innocent mistake but just a heads up", "author": "Nadia L."}

I got the crispy skin salmon served with roasted tomatoes, asparagus, arugula & caper berries  The perfect thing for summer.  The hubby got portabello mushroom napoleon with polenta.  He couldn't stop raving about the polenta.  Of course it wouldn't be a civilized meal without some wine - Cote de Provence rose of course! (ssshhhh... don't tell my employer).\n\nTopped it all off with Mme. Angle's Gateau Basque, which sure beats the pants off of Dianda's Almond Torte, sad as I am to report this.  The gateau basque was in a league of it's own.  And when we asked for espresso topped with steamed milk to go with dessert, they actually knew it was a macchiato.  We'd given up asking for macchiatos because no one would know what it was.  \n\nLike I said, extremely civilized - a rare find these days.\n\nBike Parking: none!

The mussles and frites were awesome and we highly recommend everyone to order that entree.  The french onion soup was one of the best we had ever.  The onions were sweet and the soup was just the right flavor.  The crab napolean was refreshing.  The short ribs were tender but didn't have the \"wow\" factor of the mussels.\n\nWe finished off our dinner by having the banana chocolate bread pudding dessert, which was fantastic!

It tingled on my tounge with the happiest little tingle I've ever experienced.  I had the traditional duck confit with lentils, and the lentils were exquisite.  The duck was perfectly prepared.

We were going to be an hour late, but when we called to let them know, they were completely understanding and accommodating. When we got there, we didn't have to wait too long to get seated, but there really isn't a waiting area except for the ramp up to the dining area. It felt kind of awkward just being in people's way when they were trying to enter or leave. We squished close to the end of the bar, but the bartender completely ignored us. Kind of odd. However, after we were seated, service picked up. Our waiters were very polite, informative. I wouldn't say nice, but not standoffish either. Professional, even with the crumb scrapers. \n\nFood was lackluster. Maybe I was expecting too much, or maybe they were holding back for the DAT menu. Scallops with mango salsa was good. Calamari with jalapeno and peppers - would not order again, as much as I love jalapenos. Had too much of that capsicum aftertaste, if that makes sense. Duck Confit with lentils was eh. Duck was very tender, good but nothing special. Dessert was hazelnut almond mousse - also tasty but nothing special. \n\nOverall, service and ambiance greatly outpaced the food leading to 3.5 stars.

Today, as is typical, I received the phone call from the restaurant to confirm my reservations. After I confirmed that I will be there tomorrow night the gentleman told me something to the effect that they had tables available if I wanted to arrive a little earlier. I told the gentleman that I cannot as I have very specific plans and that is why I made the reservations for the time I did. Then he proceeds to tell me that I need to come earlier because the kitchen closes at the exact same time as they made my dinner reservation for.

A friend and I were on time, but our other 2 friends were 20 minutes late. The floor manager was pretty discombobulated. He said we could sit down, but then he wasn't sure, but then we should go over to the bar (which we did), then we could sit down, no wait till we know what's happening with the table, sit, don't sit, wait, uh, okay, after 5 minutes we were able to sit at the table in the so far 1/2 full restaurant. Not a big deal, but kind of awkward.\n\nThere were 3 choices each for DAT's - appetizer, entree, and dessert. I forget all the options now, but I got the Calamari for the appetizer - that was good, but not super memorable. The entrees I think were Filet Mignon, Salmon, and Duck. I got the Salmon, and that was really good. My friends all got the Filet Mignon. For dessert I got the Creme Brulee.\n\nThe service was, well, French. Our waitress was hot, so I'm probably being more lenient than normal. Actually, even aside from that, service was fine. I don't know that this place was memorable enough for me to come back though. \n\nParking in the area on a Friday night sucked. I think I parked two blocks away, way the fuck down on Bryant & 6th. Not a big deal to me either, but be prepared to look for a while, or drive around if you want free parking (after 6pm).\n\nAs others have said, it was fairly small, but I would describe it more as intimate than cramped, but I'm pretty easy-going.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, we almost missed the door because it doesn't look like a regular door! Looked like the back side door or something... but we're smart so we figured out that this was the entrance to the restaurant.  At first glance, the restaurant is very casual, yet nice and had a very nice cozy feeling to it. It's small, but can surprisingly hold a lot of tables given the arrangement of the tables. We were a lil squished with 7 people at a normal 6 person table.\n\nWe waited for our 2 friends to come, but in the meantime, we were all starving and requested some bread.  Despite our request for bread early, the waiter didn't bring it out until everyone at our table had arrived, about 15 minutes later. Bad service in my opinion.  Anyway, we paid a $20 corkage fee for our own wine and at least had some wine to sip on while waiting.  \n\nI debated on doing DAT or just ordering from the regular menu, but as soon as I saw \"filet mignon\" int he DAT menu, my mind was made up and there was no turning back.  The DAT menu is a little different than shown on the official DAT website, but for the better. \n\nFor appetizers, you have the choice of: \n- dungeness crab ravioli\n- spicy calamari (not really spicy at all)\n- Assiette de charcuterie maison, saucisson sec, rillette, pate & frisee\n\nEntrees:\n- Coq au vin, mashed potato, mushrooms, spinach, pearl onion & red wine sauce \n- Sautee petrale sole, squash, English peas risotto & sorell beurre blanc\n- Grass fed filet mignon, pomme frites, mixed greens & shallots sauce\n\nDesserts:\n- Cr\u00e8me brulee\n- Hazelnut & almond cake\n- Chocolat gourmand\n\nI ordered the spicy calamari, filet mignon and hazelnut almond cake.  The calamari was good but could have used more jalapenos for a spicy flavor. It looks exactly as it does in the pictures--not breaded or fried, but still had good flavor to it. The crab ravioli was also really good, filled with lots of dungeness crab.  It only comes with 4-5 pieces, but it's so filling that quantity doesn't matter.  My filet was cooked medium rare and came out perfectly.  At first glance, I was disappointed in it's tiny size... but in reality, it was the perfect size because of it's thickness.  I was definitely stuffed!  The filet was very juicy, tender, and very flavorful. No one was disappointed.  My friend order the macaroni pasta with mushrooms and artichoke since she's a vegetarian.  It was pretty bland and dry.  I'm sure after seeing our filets she wished she was a carnivore. haha  My other friend got the sole with risotto, which she loved and inhaled. She was finished before any of us steak eaters were done.  I'm sure if she could, she would have picked up the plate to lick it.  The desserts were also amazing!  Despite having difficulty finishing my filet mignon, we had no problems finishing the desserts.  The hazelnut almond mousse cake was fantastic!  It was light yet flavorful. The toasted almonds on top also added a nice touch to it.  The creme brulee did not disappoint!  The chocolate cake was just ok to me, but that's because I'm not a big fan of chocolate.  Out of the 3 desserts, my fav was the mousse cake, then creme brulee.\n\nOverall, our experience at Fringale was great.  It was a good atmosphere with dim lights and quaint, cozy feel.  The food was delicious!  I would recommend all my friends to come here for their DAT menu, if not DAT, then just to eat!  With corkage and DAT, each person paid about $48.", "author": "Diane L."}

Quality of meat for both was first rate, sauces very very tasty and authentic, sides excellent (pommes cooked to perfection). Meal tasted. As if cooked by a little tiny French country grandma was in the kitchen. The dessert we shared was the almond cake - fresh, tasty, not too sweet but very delicious. Good glasses of red wine with meal the helpful and charming owner(?) recommended was perfect. Waitstaff super professional. Not overly engaged as often noted in so many (too many) restaurants in San Fran. Bread excellent - butter was very very good (good enough to notice). With tip dinner for two pricey at $175 (2 glasses wine plus 2 glasses cocktails total) but definitely worth it. A quiet evening with amazing quality meat superbly cooked and attentive yet not intrusive service- that is pretty rare in our experience in San Fran dining- made it well worth it (plus we were celebrating a Bday).

The sole was baked in a light batter and placed on top a bed of creamy risotto with squash.  The sole was a perfect complement to the more savory appetizer.

The place was so small, it seemed like they added more tables to accommodate DAT diners and sometimes the waiter would walk by and knock into my chair.  That was annoying. \n\nFurthermore, I felt slightly rushed towards the end of our meal due to the fact the waiters were asking us if we were done and clearing our plates rapidly.  I understand that you're trying to accommodate more diners and it's busy...but I don't like to be rushed when eating.  \n\nI had the charcuterie, very good.  I tasted the crab ravioli, but it needed more sauce and it came out warm instead of hot.  \n\nI had the filet for main course, cooked perfectly.  I tasted the coq au vin, that was delicious, the chicken was delicate and full of flavor.  \n\nI had the hazelnut mousse cake for dessert, absolutely great! It was so light and not too sweet.

Atmospehere is definitely \"bistro\" but I agree with the other reviewer who said the food was closer to \"gastromonique.\" I was disappointed the roast chicken takes 20+ minutes, so went with the filet, which was by far the best piece of beef I've eaten in months. Perfectly prepared and seasoned, with a great sauce. Fries were good too. \n\nI especially appreicated the attentive service, with big bonus points for the quiet refilling of the bread bowl. My dining companions all cleaned their plates (pork tenderloin, duck confit and the coq au vin).

This cozy little restaurant with its unassuming front is located in a somewhat sketchy part of SF near the warehouse district and AT&T park.  The first impression I got was how French it was, down to the stereotyped accents of the host (I guess maitre d?) and waiters. \n\nBeing part of a large dinner party it gave me the opportunity to sample many of the dinner menu items and I can honestly say I enjoyed all of them. Among the appetizers I sampled were the foie gras terrine (I really have to stop eating fatty goose liver or my own liver will turn into one) Monterey calamari and Roasted Butternut Squash soup.  Dinner items included the steamed Mussels, traditional Duck Confit, braised Veal short ribs (cruelty never tasted more delicious) and poached Black Cod.  \n\nThe combination of decently priced dishes with friendly and attentive service capped off with the cozy, smart yet family friendly ambiance makes this bistro a solid recommendation to anyone who wants a nice group dinner or date in SF", "author": "Ed K."}

Initially our waitress was rather attentive, but she soon became rather scarce and it rapidly became apparent that the staff on hand were insufficient to the task of taking care of the dining room.  2 waits and one manager for about 45 diners is tough, but this kind of situation is manageable for people who know what they're doing and hustle.  Unfortunately, the manager stood behind the bar occasionally chatting with guests and was of absolutely no use to anyone.  The other two cooperated reasonably well, but he moved with a speed and energy appropriate to a person with late-stage tuberculosis, and she was nice enough but unfocused and rather inexperienced.  The result was a 45-minute wait between the salads and the main course, during which we all ran out of water / tea / Coke / etc.  When it came time for dessert and coffee, it was clear from context that nobody suspected a connection between the lack of interest in coffee or dessert and the impossibly long wait for the main course.  Everyone now tardy for afternoon meetings, general irritation all around.\n\nThis all said, my beet salad was extravagantly delicious, worthy of any restaurant I have ever visited, and the duck confit was basically sound despite marginally lame treatment for the accompanying lentils.  My side of Brussels sprouts was simply grand.  The fresh bread, well, brilliant.  \n\nIn summary, good food, but from today's experience, they don't actually understand very well the nuts and bolts of running a restaurant.  I would consider going again given unlimited time to enjoy the meal.\n\nThere was construction outside, with a huge crane / drill thing idling the whole time we were there.  Inexplicably, the staff kept the front door open most of the time despite a C-weighted sound pressure level in the mid-eighty decibel range with a bowel-loosening peak intensity right around 45 Hz.  Gotta love the iPhone real-time analyzer applications.  Great stuff.  How loud is it?  That's right.  Hella loud.  Anyway...I am rating it loud but today it was actually VERY LOUD and why, oh God why would you leave the front door propped open for that?  Goodness gracious.\n\nAh.

Napoleon would have been very proud that such a delicious appetizer was named after him.\n\nSteamed PEI mussels in fried garlic, fresh herbs & sherry vinegar [$17] showed that Fringale was certainly not frugal when it came to the amount of mussels.

The sauce that accompanied it was also great for bread-dipping.\n\nThe glass of Rose, Cotes de Provence '05 [$8] is a very girly wine but it was the perfect wine throughout my meal.

A small quaint little French restaurant tucked into the SOMA district.  It's warm, cozy and inviting, and the service is fantastic.\nI started with the Fris\u00e9e salad with warm bacon dressing and my husband had the Butternut squash soup.  Both were interesting and delicious.  The salad had a little tang to it which was balanced by the yolk of the poached egg.  The Butternut squash soup was not as creamy as others that I have had, but it was delicious.\nFor entrees we had Poached Alaskan Halibut and the Creekstone Farm Black Angus ribeye steak.  Yum, yum, yum!\nMy salmon was perfectly poached and the potatoes it was served on were pillowy and flavorful.  The salmon was topped with a tapenade, which was a little strong at times, but was a necessary accessory.\nThe ribeye was full of flavor and the red wine butter was a great addition.  The service was attentive but not smothering.  \nOverall, the food is reasonably priced, the service was great, the wine selection good, and the food was top notch.  I would highly recommend Fringale and we will return.", "author": "Dana B."}

But perhaps it's that cozy, tight-knit feeling they are trying to achieve.  I took a peek around the restaurant as I entered. I noticed that only about 1/2 of the restaurant was occupied... which I thought wasn't too bad for the Tuesday evening.\n\nThe atmosphere for the evening was nice.  It was definintely a pleasant dining experience.  Our waiter was quite the professional.  He kept on top of everything and was eager to please and serve us.\n\nOur group of 4 started off with some appetizers:\n(1) Roasted beet salad, goat cheese, mache, pear, candied walnuts & balsamic vinaigrette \n(2) Spicy Monterey calamari \"\u00e0 la plancha\", jalapenos, chorizo & olives\n(3) Saut\u00e9ed prawns in Pastis, sun dried tomatoes, shallots & chives\n(4) Dungeness crab Napoleon, avocado, tomato confit, lemon zest & cr\u00e8me fraiche \n\nEverything was quite yummy.  Although the spicy calamari lacked spicyness... or at least I thought so.  Other than that, each dish was very unique and tasty.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered: \n(1) Traditional duck confit, lentils \"Du Puy\",garlic,bacon & red wine sauce \n(2)  Seafood basquaise, salmon, cod, prawns, tuna, mussels, red pepper & tomato coulis\n(3)  Creekstone Farm black angus ribeye steak, pommes frites, red wine butter sauce\n(4) The special roasted chicken \n\nI thought the duck was so-so.  A little dry if you ask me.  The seafood dish was tasty, but there wasn't a huge wow factor.  The ribeye was seared to perfection and the red wine butter sauce that came with it was a wonderful compliment to the meat.  The roasted chicken (which was the special for the evening) was good as well, but not one of these 4 dishes truly stood out nor made me feel like the price I was paying was indeed worth it.\n\nLastly, we ended up ordering a few desserts to share:\n(1) Warm sponge cake bread pudding with chocolate and bananas \n(2) Creamy custard with a caramelized sugar crust \n(3) Assortment of house made sorbets\n\nI will have to say that the highlight of the evening was probably the dessert and the company I was with that made the meal an enjoyable one.... even though it was on the pricey side.\n\nI was glad to have tried Fringale since I've driven by it numerous times but never had a chance to make it in tilll yesterday.   I think in comparison to other French restaurants in the city, Fringale would rank in mid-way somewhere if I had to rank it.  A nice place to try if you've never been, but there isn't much to rave about in terms of the food.... in my opinion at least.", "author": "Vindy C."}

Nice, clean ambiance with glowing yellow and cream-colored interior.  Andre, our server, greeted us with a warm smile (who said the French weren't friendly?).  \n\nThe delicious: spicy calamari \"a la plancha\" and fresh beef carpaccio slices.  Great complementary dishes in flavor with wonderful chewy, soft, and buttery textures.  We also enjoyed the sole and yukon mashed potato entree - light and creamy taste.  Hazelnut mousse & burnt almond dessert was also enjoyable, though I like a lighter texture for my mousse.\n\nThe disappointment: the veal entree was a bit dry and reminded me more of a pot roast than a gourmet dish.  The creme brulee sugary top had the lingering taste of char and lighter fluid.  And the half bottle of Chinon red wine wasn't distilled properly and left behind a residue of deposits in our glasses.\n\nTo be fair, I imagine that many of the patrons were ordering mass amounts of the Dine About Town options.  These may not be their most expensive and shining dishes.  However, isn't the purpose of Dine About Town meant to bring their customers back?

But it wasn't the fish that was amazing but the SAUCE. I was tempted to lick the plate clean, it was THAT good. The Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was one of the BEST I've ever had. Highly recommended.\n\nOverall, the restaurant was a delight and provided a great fine dining experience.

Nope, the nice middle aged rich ladies in single strands of perls had little choice other than to give us funny looks.\n\nThe wait staff, bless their hearts, tried to act like we ordinary customers as we dined discussing recent playa trips rather than gout --or whatever it is old people talk about at dinner.\n\nThe food was good, but it wasn't amazing.  Nothing really knocked my socks off. \n\nThe place was so crowded that I couldn't scoot my chair back without bumping into some disapproving guy my dads age in a \"sport coat\".  They packed people in there like sardines.  In fact, you had to climb your way through piles of people--and the kitchen--to get to the ladies room.\n\nThe meal was prix fixe at $75/ea plus wine.

So for the good of my family, and my fathers incessant need to not take things TOO seriously, I made reservations for Fringale.\n\nI'm very glad I did.\n\nFriends and family in tow, we made the long trek from Hayes Valley in an uneventful (but this is a good thing in a cab ride, because an eventful cab trip probably means you've struck and killed a pedestrian; funny in Hunter S. Thompson novels, fairly tragic in reality.) We arrived, and were seated by a what can only be described as a stylish (A FRENCHMAN WITH STYLE AND GRACE? WHY I NEVER!) waiter seated us quite promptly, which was only the beginning of the trend this man was setting for the night; service was always quick, efficient and attentive. \n\nOur glasses were always filled, our plates were quietly whisked away at just the right time, and most importantly for places like this, the waiter never lingered long enough to interrupt our conversation, or the chastising of my dad for making poop jokes.\n\n------- QUICK ANECDOTE ABOUT MY FATHER: Love the guy to death, always supported me in my hopes and dreams, offered me advice and insight to situations that I thought unsolvable... He also loves a good poop joke. Can't fault the man for it. I prefer dead baby jokes; they tend to lend a bit more class to any situation.\n\nBut lets get back to what the French are so well known for: food. If you know me, you'll know that I'll go for the cheapest possible jokes no matter what the situation, so lets get the \"surrender\" jokes out of the way right now. We may as well surrender to the French right now: the French have already invaded us, and they've invaded us through our mouths. Which sounds dirty, but like anything done the French way, it tastes great.\n\nI notice that a lot of people are talking about what dishes they and their dining partners had; I'm not going to do that, because the most important criteria were met for me to give this place five stars: when we left, we were more than satisfied. My Mom, my Dad and my friend were all completely happy with everything here; great food, great wine, great service.", "author": "Adam M."}

(smooches to my hottie part French fiancee) \n\nSo lovely madamoiselles Irene S. and Carol C. and I decided to kick off DAT 2007 with some French Basque cuisine at Fringale on Saturday night. The cute little spot was warm and inviting, and it seemed that everyone there was taking advantage of the $31.95 pre-fixe menu, which had several wonderful dishes to choose from. \n\nFor starters, Irene and I both had the chicken terrine mousse, and Carol had the sauteed prawns in pastis. The mousse was like a light and fluffy pate served on a bed of greens with crostini to spread it on. The prawns were in a delicious sauce - much more flavorful, making the mousse taste a bit bland in comparison.  \n\nFor our main entree, Irene and I again got the same dish - lamb osso bucco (shank), and Carol got the black angus rib eye steak with fries. The lamb shank was so extremely tender and didn't have that strong gamey flavor to overpower it. It was perfectly prepared. The rib eye steak was very tasty as well, but the fries were a little dry, like In-n-out fries, which aren't my favorite. \n\nWe decided to order different desserts so we could all share. I got the warm chocolate cake, Carol got the hazelnut mousse cake, and Irene got the creme brulee. The creme brulee was my favorite (it was reminiscent of the custard in Beard Papas creme puffs), and even though the first order we received was a bit runny, it still tasted delicious. Our attentive server noticed that it wasn't at the right consistency and immediately brought us a new one, even though we had already scarfed half of it down. \n\nI'll definitely be back again to try their regular menu with mon amie.", "author": "Connie C."}

But part of me feared that because I had such a great time, I'd only be disappointed the second time around.\n\nI decided to take that chance and made a reservation for their Dine About Town promotion.  Our party of 4 arrived early for our 7:45 reservation. While waiting for the other group to pay the bill and clear out, we ordered drinks at the bar and perused the menu. While the restaurant provided lots of different options for Dine About Town (3 appetizers - prawns, salad, or chicken pate; 3 entrees - lamb osso bucco, steamed sole, or pork crepinette, and 3 desserts - pear tarte, chocolate gourmand, or a mousse cake) their regular menu also sounded very tempting.\n\nAt the end 2 of us took advantage of their DAT promotion while the other 2 ordered off the regular menu. The prawns were delicious, in a sundried tomato sauce which vaguely tasted Thai. The lamb was tender, tasty, and not at all gamey. And the chocolate gourmand (flourless chocolate cake) was YUM with a scoop of ice cream. I also got to try the spicy calamari with jalapenos and chorizo as well as the duck confit and the seafood stew.  All excellent.\n\nService was impeccable. As soon as we were seated, we were promptly poured water and provided a basket of bread. My friend relied on our waiter's recommendations and she was not disappointed with her duck confit and her bread pudding.

Fringale was good on all fronts.  I have not a single complaint about my experience here.\r\n\r\nWe thought about doing the Pelligrino dine out special 3 course for $35, but the non-special dishes were simply too tempting, given the small price difference.  We ordered the frisee salad (with bacon dressing and a poached egg), and the prawn ravioli in a lobster bisque to start.  The frisee salad was tasty, but the prawn ravioli was to die for.  The lobster bisque was much better than most I've had, with some slightly latin inspired spicing I think, and more of the lobster \"yellow\" (from the head) that the chinese love so much.  amazing way to start the meal.  \r\n\r\n For entrees, we got the ribeye and the lamb chops.  Man, they were both excellent.  Ribeye was perfectly prepared (a perfect medium rare), and so were the lamb chops.  THe lamb chops came with these potatoes au gratin baked in a cylindrical shape with this nice crispy crust on top.  The balance of flavors and the presentation were all impeccable.\r\n\r\nTo go with the meal, we got a bottle of the reserve de la comtesse Pauillac bordeaux (I think it was a 2003...but I can't remember for sure), which was a well crafted red with a long finish, though not with the boldness I was hoping for with a full-on cabernet sauvignon.  I figured this was a french/basque restaurant so I'd go for a bordeaux.  It went well with just about everything, but was overpowered by the lamb and ribeye.  Still a beautiful wine though.\r\n\r\nThe desserts...wow.  The chocolate bread pudding with bananas and vanilla ice cream.... [shudder].... not as sweet as I expected (which is good) with more chocolatey goodness, and a unique texture more like a moist cake than a bread pudding.  I had the apple tart with vanilla ice cream (homemade) special, but it wasn't your typical apple pie a la mode.  It came with caramel on top and a strawberry compote (I believe) strewn over it in a gorgeous arrangement, with a couple strawberry halves too.  The balance of textures and flavors sent tingles down my spine that I did not expect form a simple apple tart with vanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\nAll that, and our waitress, who was from paris, served us perfectly, even apologizing for spilling a small drop of wine on the table when she poured for me.  My water was always filled quickly, and whenever I felt the urge to pick up the bottle of wine and refill our glasses, she was already there picking up the bottle.  Simply perfect.\r\n\r\nThe place was not too big, but not too small, with warm lighting.  cozy, with some decent soundproofing, so everything around was a dull murmur, and we chatted easily without raising our voices.\r\n\r\nThe other items on the menu looked interesting, with a boquerones dish, and some latin-inspired dishes as well--clearly the basque influence.  I was in more the french mood, so I did that this time, but when I come back, I might just do more of the spanish options.\r\n\r\nGreat restaurant, decently priced.  I'm definitely a fan!

Granted that I only ordered a chocolate souffle dessert and wine, we made sure that we ordered enough, i.e., our tab was still pretty hefty.  We did not stay long either, so we did not take up a lot of time and space.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe food at Fringale is good but not memorable.  Given that the City is inundated with fine cuisine and very diverse dining options,  Fringale's snobby service took away from the warm fuzzy feeling that good food and wine bring--good side effects of having an enjoyable meal.\n\nBTW, my experience is not unique at Fringale.

However, I am big believer that if you're not going to tip well, an explanation is necessary, so we quietly called the manager aside as we were leaving.\n\n\"How can I help you?\" he said in his french accent that suddenly seemed far more snooty and condescending than charming.\n\n\"I just wanted to let you know that we were unhappy with the service, and that was reflected in the tip,\" my dining companion said.\n\n\"Oh, zell, I am sorry,\" he said, although his actually meaning, \"I could care less what you think\" was loud and clear.\n\nWe turned to walk away, but his utter lack of regard for our dining experience was just too much for me to handle. \"Clearly you don't care,\" I said to him.\n\n\"WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? Why do you say I don't care?!\" His voice got louder, and yes, people were starting to look at us.\n\n\"Because if you cared, you would have asked us WHY we had a bad experience!\"\n\n\"I am going to ask THEM,\" he said, nodding towards the waitstaff.\n\n\"But you have to ask US since we're the people who had the bad experience,\" I tried to reason.\n\n\"Fine,\" he scoffed. \"What was so wrong?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I started, \"We thought all our servers were completely unfriendly. But CLEARLY that's just how this place is.\"\n\nAnd, with that, I walked out. After all, you can't explain the importance of charm to someone who has none.\n\nSure, our $19 entrees were good, but at that price, I'd much rather eat at a restaurant where smiles are not discouraged.", "author": "daisy b."}

I've been coming here for 10 years now and although the restaurant has gone through many changes (as with any business), I know I can come here for consistently tasty, bistro comfort food. Jean-Marie and Andre are awesome! We came in a group of six on our last visit, half of which were late. Even though the restaurant was packed, they didn't give us a hard time or rush us through our dinner! \n\nWe ordered the prawns in pastis (a classic!) and crab napolean for our appetizers. The frisee salad is also highly recommended and the majority of the table ordered the rib eye steak with pommes frites for their main course. I ordered the salmon and planned on eating only half (watching my waistline), but it was so nice and crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside, I practically licked my plate clean! Feeling guilty, I looked up and noticed everyone else's plate was clean as well! Whew! The hubby and I had to fight over the last of the french fries.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the hazelnut mousse cake and they gave it to us on the house along with a lime dessert.\n\nGreat food, great service, strong drinks, an intimate and cozy atmosphere...what more can you ask for?", "author": "Bernadette A."}

It is small and intimate but not loud.\n\nOK, this is going to sound really dumb, but how do the French reliably make the best frites in the world?  (Told you).  My better half ordered the rib-eye and frites, which is just what she ordered the last time we were here (7 years ago) and it was as good as she remembered.  For those not in the know, it comes with this incredible butter concoction that melts on the meat.  Seriously good.\n\nI got a basquese or something like that which amounted to a bouillabaisse-style dish with chunks of fish and some mussels.  I was glad she had some fries that I was able to dunk into the amazing broth which was delicate, bold and savory all at once.\n\nWe shared an appetizer, had two entrees, 1 glass of wine, 1 cocktail, split a dessert and two coffees for $65 including tip.", "author": "Brad P."}

Originally booked Pesce, but decided against it when realized the Union Street Fair was happening in close proximity.  Friends recommended Fringale.  Boy, I'm I glad they did!\n\nShould be noted my bf is French, and so are his friends, so their opinion of French restaurants carry a lot of weight.  I don't think I've ever had a more perfect meal.  \n\nIt was DAT time (which I have never participated in before) and it proved to be a happy coincindence.  All the items I wanted to try were on that pre-selected menu...and all were divine!  Spinich & pine nut ravioli that quite literally melted in my mouth.  Duck Confit on lentils that was so scrumptious, I almost licked my plate!  Almond & hazlenut cake that was so light & delicate, the perfect ending to the perfect meal.\n\nMy bf had the filet mignon, the scallop appetizer and the chocolate gourmannd dessert.  Equally divine.  We were happily tasting each others' selections and having a hard time deciding who had the best meal.\n\nService was excellent.  Attentive.  Perfectly timed.  Unobtrusive.  The restaurant itself is very small & a little cramped, that's the only negative I can find.  It was a rather warm night in the city, so ceiling fans or opening the windows would've made the whole atmosphere much improved.\n\nThis is not a sexy looking venue...no 'views' or ambiance to speak of, but lots of parking, a short hop to the Embarcadero, where we completed our evening with a walk along the bay.\n\nGive Fringale a try.  You won't be disappointed in the exquisite food.", "author": "laura c."}

Both Linh and I ordered the charcuterie/pate plate as appetizer, while friend Randy ordered the lobster ravioli. Charcuterie plate hit the spot - nice slab of pate, a few pieces of salami and prosciutto, 2 baby pickles and a few slabs of bread. The lobster ravioli looked quite hearty, perhaps 4-5 big sized raviolis in delicious thick sauce.\n\nEntree, we all ordered filet mignon, medium rare. This shit was good. It was served with some mixed greens and the most delicious fries ever. Perfectly crispy and salty. Everything was devoured. For dessert, I got the chocolate gourmand. Thick dense chocolate cake with some ice cream on top. Good...not awesome, but good. I left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied. \n\nService was great, atmosphere was friendly and unpretentious. Seemed like all the servers had french accents (very cool).

Unfortunately, I was sick for our date, so my review of the food is a bit second hand.\n\nWe all ordered off the DAT prix fixe menu-- JF ordered calamari and the veal osso bucco. TW had the beef carpaccio and the veal. I had the beef carpaccio and the sole. The spices the calamari was cooked with definitely had some Asian flair, which was unexpected. The portion was also quite generous. I couldn't really taste the beef carpaccio, but I thought the cheese that came with it was pretty delicious (one of the only flavors strong enough to penetrate through my sickness induced taste-blindness). \n\nFor the main course... I had a taste of JF's osso bucco... verdict: my sole was much more delicious. I couldn't even taste much and I still thought that was the case. In terms of texture, the sole was a little overcooked, and the sauce surrounding it was too buttery. But the fillet was well seasoned, and the greens in the dish were really good.\n\nThe three of use ordered one of each dessert that was available. JF and TW both thought the creme brulee was one of the better ones they had tasted. I of course couldn't taste anything. It did however have a nice creamy consistency. According to JF the hazelnut mousse cake was too sweet, and the apple tart very plain.\n\nOverall I thought that based on the prix fixe menu, Fringale lacked creativity. The execution of each dish was fine, but nothing to make me sit on the edge of my seat anticipating the next course. I also didn't leave with giddy and rambling on about how delicious the food was... I should probably return at least once to sample the food when I can actually appreciate subtle flavors.", "author": "Susanna W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-16", "description": "Fringale was an all-around pretty good meal.\nI had dinner here on Friday night and thought about it until now, unable to decide 3 or 4 stars...\nNo matter which way I turned it, it hovered between 3.25-3.75 w/ only one dish exceeding 4 stars.  That alone cannot really take the entire rating over 4 stars, can it?\n\nI've uploaded the photos of the food.\n\nIt's a very small place that is designed in such a way that when you walk in, the whole restaurant is actually looking at you.  They have a small bar to your left, with seating, and the full menu is available there.  It would almost be better to sit there in order to have it be somewhat private, I think, as the remainder of the tables are really packed in together.  I know that the woman to my left hates Bush - and I know that the guy diagonally to my right had been dating that girl for two months and feels that things are going well.  He told her so... and I overheard.  They, in turn, probably know my whole life story too, though - so life is fair.\n\nNow, for good food, I don't much care how you treat me like a sardine - - but this is where Fringale lacks.\n\nBefore I get into the food, though - - service was mediocre.\nWhen I enter a restaurant, and have reservations - - it'd be nice to have someone up front  asking if I have a reservation or saying hello.  Nobody was there, and if there was an official maitre'd - - I never saw him because he was either serving or acting as a server and host?  In San Francisco, w/ such a wide array of \"California French\" or even French cuisine-type places available, there's no excuse for shoddy service, or lack of attention.  I definitely am not one that likes to be doted on through the meal, but how a person is treated upon walking into an establishment is crucial in the service world.  Ask me if I have a reservation, and if you're not ready to seat me just yet-  show me where I should be until you are.... offer a drink or tell me something.\nWhen someone finally did approach - - I can't say they were rude.  Everyone was nice enough - but nowhere near the caliber of a 5-star, or even 4-star establishment.  \nI will add that our own waiter was very pleasant and sweet, but he alone cannot carry the whole restaurant.  (The food can.)\n\nUnimpressed.\n\nNow, the food.\nWe ordered a bottle of an '03 Cabernet, a Stonehedge Reserve Cabernet.  Very nice wine, I've had it before and I enjoyed it just as much this time.  We had some bread served to us w/ butter - - and it was good.\n\nAppetizers included their calamari and their shrimp ravioli.\n- The shrimp ravioli was strange.  The filling was a bit too shrimpy (fishy?) and SWEET.  Not a good combination.  The sauce that accompanied it was not a good match either, though it was a tasty sauce on its own, but it was just an all around odd combination.\n- The grilled octopus, however, was QUITE good.  It's a pretty spicy dish, and has a definite Asian flair to it.  Good, yes... but I'd expect it at Schezuan ________ or Korea Palace, not at Fringale.  Still, it was very good w/ fresh octopus and perfectly cooked.  It was actually, for you Koreans, typical \"Ojinguh-bokkeum\".\n\nFor entrees - we ordered the Pork Tenderloin w/ Cabbage and Apples, and the Ribeye Steak.\n- A+ for giving us medium-rare steak when we asked for medium-rare.  Was it good?  Yes.  Excellent?  No.  There was nothing special about it, but I love ribeye steak so it worked out just fine, but nothing about this dish was stellar except that it was seasoned well and cooked as requested - but the cut of meat was actually too thin - and too fatty.  That said --  the pomme frites that accompanied it were AMAZING.  I loved these fries... whoo boy.  Fried just perfectly.  This was the most expensive dish offered on the menu, though the price evades me now.\n- The Pork Tenderloin was 5-star material.  Juicy, cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly - and the accompaniments were great too.  Apples were perfect, and even the cabbage, which I don't usually like, supported the pork just perfectly.  Sweet, meaty goodness on a plate.  EXCELLENT.\n\nWe skipped dessert and didn't order coffee.  Aside from the pork dish - - there was nothing there to be salvaged after that meal. \n\nFor me, 3-stars signifies, \"I'd eat there again, but not at my own suggestion\" - and that is about what Fringale is.  Having seen other entrees being served, I'm curious to try the duck and the lamb one day, but don't have my hopes up for it.\n\nWhile the pricing is very reasonable for a French restaurant - - this is good only if the food is still stellar w/ lower prices.  If you're going to give me mediocre food for better prices - then I'd opt for higher priced spectacular food any day of the week.", "author": "Grace K."}

Ah, if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be as motivated to drive my ass to SF to deal with the 1 hour drive, 30 minute parking fiasco, and pouring rain. \n\nAh, but we did even though earlier we were secretly thinking of calling it off. It was a weeknight and we were tired from work, and it was late and freezing. =)\n\nAfter driving in circles for awhile, we finally got to Fringale and lucked out on parking - we parked RIGHT next to the restaurant - score! This was going to be a good night. \n\nFringale is a small, cozy, and private restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised to see actual French people working there. Cool! It was nice to speak to our friendly waiter in my broken French. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nBeet and goat cheese salad - WOW, I've never really had beets. I mean really taste them. This salad was REALLY good. I love cheese, and the cheese on this salad was deliceux! I really enjoyed the beets as well - sweet and fresh. \n\nSauted prawns in pastis with sun dried tomatoes - YUM. I loved these. The combination of the cream sauce, tomatoes, and lemon squeezed on top was tres bon!\n\nSole with mashed potatoes, spinach, with a cream sauce - LOVED it. I'm not a big fish person (although I am starting to be), but this dish was absolutely devine. Again, it's all about the sauce! And the freshly squeezed lemon.\n\nLamb w/ sliced veggies - slow cooked lamb. By the time Cynthia and I split plates, then switched, I had one bite and was already pretty full. But I thought this was very good despite just having one bite. It came with thinly sliced and sauteed carrots and onions. Brought the leftovers for the bf and he liked it a lot - said the veggies were cooked very well.\n\nWarm chocolate Gourmand - this flourless chocolate cake isn't your typical flourless chocolate cake. It was rich, but not too rich, and wasn't a candy bar on a plate. I loved it! Came with a side of vanilla sorbet/ice-cream and strawberry compote.\n\nTarte Tatin de poire aux aromates - If you like cinnamon, ginger, and pears, then this dessert is for you. The pears had an explosion of flavor and was placed atop a layer of pastry. Note to self - try this before eating the rich chocolate. Very strong on the ginger/cinnamon, and very tasty. Came with a side of vanilla sorbet/ice-cream, fresh strawberries and kiwi.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience. It's a casual, elegant, and intimate setting. Service was good and non-obtrusive. (Except for the time that another waiter was moving Cynthia's plate as she was still eating off of it. That was kind of weird). Our waiter was patient with my broken/slow French, and also helped me practice. I checked out the regular menu, and the most expensive thing was $24. Pretty decent prices for the quality of food. I will be back to check out some of their more traditional dishes like duck confit, etc. \n\nC'est tres bon ! Merci beaucoup, Fringale !", "author": "Ta G."}

But, although there were two tables very close to mine, I did not feel like I was at the same table as these people.  The room was actually mellow and lively all at once.  You were having a good time and you knew that people at the other tables were, but you didn't feel like anyone was overpowering the room.  You were having fun amongst others having fun while not dragging other people away from their good time into yours.  Make sense?  Maybe that's what French bistrots are really about.  People getting together for great conversation set among others doing the same.  Peut-etre?\n\nAnyway . . .  the food was very delicieux! We both started with the Frisee salad with warm bacon dressing, poached egg and toasted levain.  I ordered it not realizing that toasted levain was just toast (yummy toast though).  I didn't care wtf it was.  I was like \"wait, does that really say bacon dressing?  Warm fuckin' bacon dressing?  Bacon dressing?!?  I am so in!\"  I'd never had a poached egg before and I didn't care.  All I knew was that I had to get me some bacon dressing.  Oh, Maman!  I'm glad I did.  That was just a grassy-bacony-eggy bowl of goodness with some special toast and fresh ground pepper on top.  Yum (en Francais)!\n\nAs an intermezzo . . . Our table was along the front wall, nearest the door.  And there was heat pouring out of the wall and I thought me and my merino were gonna catch on fire.  It was like sitting in front of a roaring fire.  Nu-uh! Non! Non! Non!    We asked our waiter if something could be done.  He really took some good French accented care of us.  He said that people had been complaining that it was cold so they could not turn off the heat.  He pulled our table a bit from the wall and opened the window a smidge.  He said he was very chaud himself.  And, then he got the heat turned off.  No one complained and we were able to dine without being singed!  Merci Mister Garcon!\n\nLe Main Course:  I had the pork tenderloin.  It came with rings of apple that were so out of this monde.  They added quite a bit to the dish.  The pork sat on some very fancy schmancy cole slaw.  The sauce was rich and excellent.  Me likey.  The bf had seabass that he said was excellent.  He never offered me a taste so that's all I can tell you.  It all washed down well with the Schug Pinot Noir we had.  \n\nIn sum, en Franglais . . .  really bien food in a tres pleasant room with bon service.  Reasonable prix.

Blocks seemed never-ending and the wind blew us to the closest restaurant, CoCo 500. (Un)fortunately, they couldn't accommodate a table of four at 7:00pm without a reservation, and the bar was full too.  We trudged down the block to Frinagle, and were seated in a matter of minutes.  \n\nThe restaurant is adorable -- quaint, with simple elegance.  Our waiter was great.  Recommended a great Syrah ($45 a bottle is definitely reasonable.  Would order it again.)  Appetizers came in no time (only one ordered), and entrees followed accordingly.  I had the bacon pork tenderloin with braised savoy cabbage, caramelized onion sauce.  It was delectable.  The bacon wasn't overwhelming and was wrapped very neatly around the sides of the pork slices.  The pork itself was succulent, not a dry piece, albeit there were only four slices.  I was pleasantly surprised how tasty the cabbage was--chopped fine and taking the color of the caramelized onion sauce.  Desserts were excellent.  The four of us shared the chocolate bread pudding and the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.  Such simple presentation and components, but together so decadent and rich.  I enjoyed every bite.\n\nI'm definitely going again.

The restaurant itself is intimate and sports a congenial waitstaff, certainly contrary to the images of berserker fury (MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK) conjured by its name.  As far as French bistros (WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MAKING FUCK) go, Fringale is tops, and I will gladly testify before any grand jury that this is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco (THE BERSERKER IS JUST SO OBSCENE).\n\nI've had the opportunity to both dine and drink wine at the bar here, both of which were pleasant experiences.  In the war against hunger, the food goes above and beyond the call of duty in terms of flavor and presentation (though be warned that, like any decent European restaurant, the portions are neither gargantuan nor pantagruelian in size; rather, they are more befitting the typical human's stomach, and not the corn-fed Average American's).  The food looks just as good as it tastes.  You can't go wrong with any of the entrees, but I found the grilled (not FRIED) calamari appetizer absolutely delicious.  It was a taste sensation like no other.  I couldn't shovel it into my gaping maw fast enough.  Yeah, it was THAT good.  The wine list is not very broad, but quite deep.  They have a great selection of Bordeauxs for your sipping pleasure.\n\nThe atmosphere at Fringale is quiet and romantic.  This is a perfect place for date night, so please leave your incalcitrant, malodorous children at home.  The waitstaff is very friendly and gives suitable recommendations for your food and drink.\n\nFrench cuisine has certainly made amazing advances since Pepe Le Pew first presented a dish of limburger cheese to that poor feline with the painted white stripe on her dorsal side (my sympathy has certain limits, however, since it was her own carelessness that precipitated the advances of that amorous skunk; i.e., she was totally asking for it).  Fringale is the paragon of this progress.\n\nYou would do well to experience the fare at Fringale.

This is not my idea of an interesting dish. If I doused everything with butter and oil, it would no doubt taste good. The best part of the salad was that it was served warm (due to the bacon dressing). For my entree, I had the duck confit. It was served with lentils, and that was the best part of the dish. The sauce was interesting, but the duck was not as tender as I would have liked.\n\nMy boyfriend started with pimento stuffed dungeness crab on a bed of arugula. The crab was quite tasty. For his entree, he had a Hawaiian white fish, the name of which, escapes me now. The dish came with a variety of mushrooms as well. It was decent, but the sauce seemed off.\n\nWine: our request for a recommendation for a light drinkable red yielded a 2003 Burgundy, which was too dry for my tastes. I also can't remember the name of the winery. \n\nThe best part of the meal was when the otherwise calm restaurant started playing music. All of a sudden the theme song from the Love Boat filled the dining area. As we looked around to see where it was coming from, our waiting approached us beginning to dance and sang \"the looooooove boat\". It was quite entertaining and unexpected from our otherwise stoic French waiter. \n\nThe ambiance was quite nice. There was a large party sitting near us, but also lots of couples enjoying a romantic evening. It appears that they have a lot of regulars as well. A few lonesome stragglers sat down at the bar to have dinner halfway into our meal (maybe around 9:30 - kind of late to begin having dinner on a week night). when the place had mostly emptied out. Also, the kitchen staff and host began having dinner in the dining room around this time as well. I really liked that the environment seemed comfortable even for a fancier restaurant.

Only 4 of the tables were filled so I was immediately given a table with a view of the sidewalk. This is the second in a trend of yelp reviews of Patricia Unterman's recommendations. \n\nI started with the bread basket and a glass of Concannon pinot noir ($9). Both were outstanding. I ordered the pinot as I had decided on having the \"Crispy skin salmon served with roasted tomatoes, asparagus, arugula & caper berries\" ($16). Every ingredient was superbly prepared and worked well together and well with the wine. The salmon was perfectly cooked for my taste; probably a little rare for some.\n\nI especially enjoyed the finely sliced caper berries. I asked the chef to remind me what they were and he said he used the caper berries to offset the sharpness of the arugula. It must have worked as the arugula did not taste sharp to me. ( I have had some sharp arugula in my time.)\n\nI completed my meal with the \"Mme. Angle's Gateau Basque - Dense almond torte filled with a layer of custard cream\" ($7). [Aren't online menus great? The wine menu is out of date but I was happy to look up Concannon and discover it is a Livermore vineyard] The almond flavor of the torte was just right, not too demure - not too bold,  and (again) went very well with the custard cream. I especially like the sprouts sprinkled on top.\n\nMy only disappointment was the waitress (yes, she had a wonderful French accent) forgot to bring the coffee I ordered with the torte. Neither of us said anything about this omission. However, she spent a lot of time at the bar with white-out to update my bill which I found amusing enough to not complain and still give a good tip....:^)\n\nI will definitely return here for lunch again soon; great service and food  that will be remembered for some time.", "author": "carson s."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-02", "description": "Food aside, lunch at Fringale was perfect. Service is sweet and attentive but not overbearing, in lovely French-accented English. Fringale is a tiny space with natural colors and lots of light that shines through the windows, and an array of French pop fills the air, with Phoenix leading the pack. The experience is intimate and cheerful, and it really put a bright spot in my day.\n\nThe food, however, is hit-or-miss. We opted for the Dine About Town menu, which was great at Fringale because the menu featured selections from the regular menu (usually a plus. I hate it when participating restaurants churn out a \"sample menu\" apart from their regular for DAT that ends up to be a transparent and unexciting ploy at penny-pinching). We started with Arnold Palmers which were perfectly refreshing-- fresh, acidic and with the perfect (restrained) amount of sweetness-- and the complementary bread basket with rich butter that I'm guessing was either Plugra or at least another type of Euro style butter. The rundown of the rest:\n\nSweet gem lettuce salad w/ herb vinaigrette and shaved petit basque: Y's app was a good start, a cross between a typical butter lettuce salad and a caesar. Predominantly baby romaine with a nice, floral-fragrant dressing and long shavings of Petit Basque, a great semi-hard cheese. This was a surprisingly generous portion.\n\nPrawns in pastis with sun-dried tomato: I was hoping they'd have the calamari on the menu, but settled for this. The prawns were a bit strong in flavor but it were paired with a great sauce, ideal for dipping. Didn't taste much of the pastis, but shallots and sun-dried tomatoes added contrasting sweetness and acidity. This was quite heavy, though.\n\nY. and I ordered Boeuf Bourguignon and Coq au Vin, respectively. The meats were both cooked well, braised properly; but the seasonings were lacking. Though the meat off of my chicken thighs fell of the bone, the flavors fell short. I guess that's what you get when you order chicken.\n\nOur desserts were both a touch too sweet. I would have liked more vanilla in my creme brulee and thought it a bit too thick, almost reaching the point of being curdled. Y.'s bread pudding with chocolate and banana had a nice, silky consistency with a delicious sauce, but a tad too sweet and not enough banana flavor.\n\nIf the food promised to be better next time, I wouldn't hesitate to return. But I'd probably rather risk trying out another restaurant for now.", "author": "Nuri K."}

The appetizers were very good, the carpaccio, calamari, and foie gras were excellent.  Then came the entrees, and at our table, everyone seemed disappointed except for me.  Most people either got the ribeye or the sea bass.  The ribeye was tender but woefully underseasoned and apparently not aged very long.  It simply had little taste.  The sea bass was shockingly small and I think it left the people who ordered them a bit hungry and unsatisfied.\n\nI, however, ordered the coq a vin.  I rarely see it on a menu so I had to get it and when I asked the waiter whether to get that or the ribeye, he said in a heavy French accent \"of course, the coq a vin!\"  It was fantastic.  The chicken had been stewed for 3-4 days and was infused with the wine and the mirapois and the collagen from the chicken made the sauce thick and scrumptious.\n\nDespite my good experience, I'm taking everyone's dishes into account so this place gets a 3.  I tasted the ribeye and it was indeed flavorless, so no real chance of a 4 here.  \n\nThe desserts were pretty good as well.  However, the total bill came to about $70/person.

The halibut meanwhile, paired nicely with the slightly spicy pepper. \nWe had the Almond torte for dessert and it was quite good too.\nBottomline: For not a lot of money ($70 for 3 including wine), we had 2 great dishes (shrimp appetizer and halibut) and the rest was good. \nService was a little slow, but I was willing to put up with it for the price:)", "author": "hsiao c."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-10", "description": "I wish I could give this place a higher rating, because I loved the ambiance and the intimate romantic setting. However, the food itself was sadly underwhelming for the price. For the entrees I tried the duck confit and the garlic mussels. The duck confit was good, with soft tender meat that fell easily off the bone. As for the mussels, I liked the strong garlicky flavor, and it comes in a huge bowl that can feed at least 4 people. However, half of my mussels were not fully cooked, evidenced by the closed  shells and tough chewy meat. When I told the waiter, he was surprisingly not at all apologetic and seemed almost doubtful, though eventually he did end up giving me a creme brulee on the house. When M went to the bathroom he also saw a chef leaving without washing his hands, which put another damper on our meal. The best part of our meal were the desserts. The creme brulee was thick, almost like custard, and had a delicious caramelized top. The hazelnut roasted almond mousse cake was even better than the creme brulee. It was light, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweetness. However, as harsh as a two star rating is, I can't help but think that the price of the entrees was not worth the half cooked mussels and lack of hygiene =/", "author": "Joyce H."}

Where abundant fresh ingredients and world-class spirits encourage the entertain-at-home Martha Stewards among us to do just that, it takes more than understated elegance, consistently good food, and a top shelf bar to draw them out for more.\n\nIt takes great service, devoid of pretense, and drawn from a true love for entertaining people, no? Too many times have I been enlisted in the defense of the French when it comes to service, who (like the Chinese), more often than not, expect more from their American customers than they would ever demand of themselves. Too quick are they to exit, stage right, when faced with a request off the menu.\n\nThirsty for a refreshing Pinot Grigio (not French enough for inclusion?), and eschewing the so yesteryear selection of whites, we who were celebrating my sister's 50th anniversaire decided to challenge the bartender to create a special cocktail in her honor. To our dismay, our waitress informed us that there was no grapefruit juice. Il n'y a pas de jus de pamplemousse!\n\nWhat do the French have against grapefruit?\n\nIt was a lie, of course, but to what end? Wouldn't the Petty Bourgeoisie be happier with a Chardonnay, she seemed to ask, with arched brow? We quickly moved past her to address the man behind the black stools, who quickly produced tiny, familiar cans of Del Monte.\n\nAh ha! we exclaimed, and though disappointed with the lack of pink, we ordered two with Mandarin, Rose's, a squeeze of lime, and soda, shaken long and vigorously, and served straight up. Birthday girl, also a bartender of suspicious nature, ordered Petrone Silver with a soda back. Smart. What came back for us was on the rocks. We sent them back. What finally arrived looked like the same drinks on stems, no froth, definitely not shaken. Incroyables!\n\nHave the French abandoned pride for prejudice? Or perhaps, being the first table for lunch, these two just weren't ready to entertain. Regardless, the chef appeared ready to please. The beet salad was as succulent as ever, the crusted Sea Bass tender and almost too buttered, the calamari divine. And please, before the Petty Bourgeois Americans ban fois gras from the politically correct banquet, you must indulge in the little points at Fringale.\n\nBut beware the Carpaccio. For some reason the chef has overlooked the marvels of capers and lemon juice, for too much mustard.\n \nHow American.", "author": "John Z."}

He steps away and two minutes later, comes back to tell us that they don't start this \"experience\" for 2 more days. That was it... nothing else but a long awkward pause...

I am again amazed at how generous San Franciscans are with bad restaurants.  Fringale is one star.  There is not anything they did well. The d\u00e9cor had a little charm, but I found it to be bland.  The service was rude, inattentive and at times incompetent.  For each course, the waiter switched our courses.  Since one of us ordered a prix fixe menu, you would think he could figure it out, but he didn't.  Every dish fell far short of acceptable.  The corn soup was bland and runny.  The scallop salad was too sour and overpowered the mild taste of the scallop.  My seafood stew (kind of like a bouliabase) was fishy.  The fish was overcooked, not fresh and under-seasoned.  My friend's duck confit was under-flavored and dry.  In addition, they served it with lentil stew, so the dish was a brown blob that was a one note in terms of flavor and texture.  How do you screw up duck cooked in duck fat?  Well go to Fringale and find out.  Nothing came out hot (like warm at best).

A decent prix-fixe menu, a small cosy restaurant, and good service.\n\nTo start: A generous slice of pate with sides of baby greens, mini pickles (?), and toasted bread with a side of dijon mustard. A thoughtful and well balance assortment, very tasty. The pate was not terribly salty and had good flavor. The dijon was a nice touch. The mini-pickles help to cleanse the palate in between the little open-faced pate sandwiches you can construct. Eat the baby greens, they're good too. It's all good.\n\nEntree: Hanger steak in a red wine sauce, served with pommes frites. A staple at many French restaurants, and executed very well here. The steak came partially pre-sliced and was a bit smaller than I expected. If I hadn't eaten more than half a pizza at Cheeseboard earlier, I would have been hungry afterwards. My med-rare steak was delicious, tender, and full of flavor. Even better, the outside had been seared to a slightly crispy perfection with hints of rubbed-in spices. The red wine sauce was fabulous, not over-powering, but a nice complement to the natural flavors of the steak. The fries were also really good, crispy, and not too oily. You must utilize the fries to soak up every last drop of the red wine sauce mixed with the steak juices. Think of your poor friends sitting at home eating Lean Cuisine.\n\nDessert: You must order the chocolate gourmand. Read the other reviews on Yelp, its legend grows daily. Let me tempt you, just a little bit. A flour-less, warm, chocolate brownie, topped with a scoop of ice cream and drizzled with a raspberry sauce. It's unbelievably soft, moist , and decadent, but not so sweet you need to chase with water. A good size dessert, even if you think you're full, with proper motivation and determination you can will yourself to victory. It will fill in the cracks, believe me.\n\nI was close to giving Fringale five stars, but it wasn't orgasmically good. The prix-fixe menu for dine about town made it good value though. Perhaps I'll come back and try something different from their regular menu.", "author": "Kenny J."}

Nice ambiance and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.\n\nWe ordered the spicy calamari as a shared starter.  It was REALLY tasty, super tender calamari with great flavors...could've been spicier though, but that's generally how I feel about most foods.  Then for the main course, I chose the chicken breast w/frisee salad and chantarelle mushrooms.  My friend ordered the halibut with peas & bacon.  Both looked lovely.  The chicken was great.  Crispy skin, great flavor, and a huge piece of juicy chicken breast.  The frisee salad and mushrooms were great, very tasty.  The mushrooms were a little too salty at times though.  The halibut looked tasty also.  However, only the outside really was good, great flavor or crunch, the inside was too soft so the texture really broke down.  We also ordered a side of sauteed spinach.  Good & basic, couldn't go wrong here.\n\nThe service was not bad, but could've been a little more attentive.  I finished my coke and no one came by to ask if I needed a refill.  But everyone was generally nice.

I have to say, the crowd was young and good looking - prob another result from D.A.T. \n\nOur service was scattered due to, I think, 2 larger parties that potentially sucked away our waitress into neverneverland for great amounts of time (no fault of theirs of course). Once we did order, and we all ended up ordering off of the a-la-carte, the service picked up.\n\nI had the prawns in pastis - amazing though rich. We lapped up the sauce with bread and cleaned the plate. Others enjoyed the calamari (little dry for my taste), beet and goat salad (yummy), and the crab and celery root salad (quite light and refreshing). For mains, I had the lamb which was very well prepared at a medium rare and extremely rich but flavorful potatoes gratin. Others had the steak et frites (I should have ordered this) - the meat was cooked perfectly, the frites were a little too Americanized (too large), they were not steak frites enough. Someone else had chicken, not sure how it was really.\n\nI should mention the wine list began with two dissapointments. Our first wine selected was not available (a Gigondas) and the second was a different year than originally stated. We tried it nonetheless at the urging of the manager or front of house person in charge, it was not great, a disappointment perhaps. OUr second bottle, the waitress recommended and it was quite delicious. Of course, since i didnt actually see it on the menu, i dont recall any details about the wine except that it went well with the lamb and steak.\n\ndessert was just ok. the tarte tartin should have been better and the chocolate cake was just ok. i am sure there are more tasty sweets but we didnt order them.

Maybe because they had at this point seen a full month's worth of Dine About Towners? I don't know. But 3 of the 4 dishes ordered were absolutely pointless. \n\nI started with a fois gras terrine, that when delivered, must have made me look like you had just read Dostoevsky to the dog--I just didn't get it.

I went with some friends of discriminating taste for Dine About Town. Here's the rundown:\n\nThe restaurant itself is cozy (read: very small) and classy, and the service was somehow both extremely polite AND extremely French (I kid; but I also have never heard anyone say 'bon apetit' without sounding cheesy before). Fringale is not exactly vegetarian-friendly. I would not recommend coming here with vegetarians because they would not be able to eat any of the entrees (I'm not detracting a star because it's the vegetarians' own fault if they come here!). However, my appetizer and dessert were scrumptious and completely friendly to various dietary restrictions. Tip: they do not accept any substitutions to menu items. The bill for 6 people, including tax, tip, various surcharges for SF health and big groups, came out to $47 per person. I went home pleasantly full and happy, with slightly less than the expected damage to my bank account. Not bad at all! \n\nWhat I ordered:\n- Uber-fancy ravioli appetizer (other choices were calamari and scallops; I tried both but was glad I hadn't ordered either one as I'm not a seafood person). Flavorful and delicious, and 3 big pieces were actually just the right amount of food!\n- The BEST steak I've ever had (the other choices were duck and fish). This lovely filet mignon came with fries and green beans, which were very simple but very good. I didn't ask for ketchup because that would have been crass, so I commandeered the red wine marinade floating around the plate to do the job. The beans were precisely the way green beans are supposed to be cooked (crunchy and bright green).\n- Stupendous creme brulee for dessert (other desserts were almond mousse cake or Chocolate Gourmand, which is fancy talk for brownie+ice cream - my choice was clearly the best). It was a good-sized, perfectly-caramelized portion.\n- I also ordered a plain latte, which was very tasty and gourmet and all that, but not the best I've ever had. No harm done; Fringale isn't a cafe so I don't care. \n\nAll in all, a fantastic meal at a lovely restaurant. I would definitely go again!", "author": "Namita D."}

I recently had my family visit and I treated them to dinner there. I've never seen my mom finish up anything so quickly. My sister is very picky, especially with steak and I never thought a french restaurant would be the place for a good ribeye...but it was very tender and the flavors in the marinade were fantastic.

I'm not sure what my friend thought about her butter lettuce salad, though she didn't finish it.\n\nOur entrees were the hanger steak with pommes frites, salmon with mashed potatoes and the coq au vin. I ordered the coq au vin which was incredibly succulent; the meat fell off the bones. Unfortunately, I feel the dish was lacking; it mainly tasted of wine and something was left to be desired; that \"something\" wasn't there to complement the dish. Our friend also didn't finish her hanger steak nor pomme frites. The salmon was incredible, according to the girl; as it looked so. I had a little and I agreed it was probably the best thing on the menu; that is, until our chocolate gourmands came out. We all agreed it was great.\n\nI think I need to come back another time to try things off the DAT menu,  but then again I know almost everything I get at Chapeau will be good.", "author": "Anthony K."}

The salmon was perhaps a little more cooked than I'd like, but very very good.  Their special of veal cheeks fell apart on the fork.

Right when I walked in the service was exceptional,friendly waiters and hosts that have French accents..My first course was the Dungeness Crab Napoleon. The presentation of this dish was a round and layered food item..there was a middle part of guacamole and crab meat was sandwiched on the top and bottom of the guacamole, and a bed of greens layed around it...my 2nd course was the lamb shank which was cooked perfectly that it would literally fall off the bone when I cut into it. For dessert, I had the Chocolat Gourmand. The cake was warm and there was vanilla bean ice-cream served on the top of it. The creme brulee is a good choice as well.

We had five people so we got to try pretty much the whole DAT menu.  \n\nThe shrimp and tomatoes appitizers was very yummy.  It was a little small, but I don't think that is their normal size.  The sauce was so good that I ate like four peices of bread just to dip in in there.  \n\nMy bf got the ribeye and I had the lamb.  I was soooo jealous of his steak though, but he was sweet and shared with me. :) The lamb was just okay, very tender but not too much flavor, and I usually love lamb.  The steak however was perfect.  Very flavorful and tender, and huge!  It also came with a huge pile of fries, nice and crunchy.  We came back again for our anniversary dinner and both got the steak again.  So good!!  \n\nDessert -  they were out of the creme brulee, so they let us choose anything we wanted off their dessert menu.  Yay! Everything was very good. We each had a favorite.  Try their sorbet which they make themselves.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal. \n\nBy the way, their prices are very decent for the quality of their food.  I think the average entree is about $20.  Also, there is usually plenty of street parking so you can spend that extra ten bucks on dessert!", "author": "Jenny C."}

This French restaurant is so quaint and cozy, with none of the pretentiousness that you might associate with French cuisine.

Since the dining room is a bit small, you will most likely be closer to other diners than what you're comfortable with. Fortunately, I was seated next to a very nice older couple that completely fascinated me. The night continued with a wonderful 3 course prix fixe. I started off with the crab ravioli, followed by the beef bourguinon as an entree, and finished with the classic creme brulee. All of the dishes that I had were excellent.

The people are ridiculously French with their thick accents and je ne saix quoi about them. \n\nThe food: Prefixed V-day Menu consisted of: \n\nCourse 1: choice of some pear salad, some crab something and Quail! (Sorry to all you Monte Sereno people I am about to offend) The Quail was amazing. If I could, I would eat that bird for every meal! \nI almost ate all the bones it was that good. \n\nCourse deux: blue cheese/brie with bread and fruit. Very French- but not a fan of blue cheese. My date ate his plate and mine. \n\nCourse 3: Choice of halibut, chicken, and le beuf. Fillet came perfectly prepared with potatoes. By this part in the meal I was already drunk off our Bordeaux wine and which prevented my ability to politely eat the cow. I bagged it up and pan fried it the next day... even better than what I could remember the night before.\n\nCourse 4: my favorite: DESSERT. Due to my inebriated state my memory does not remember dessert as I had hoped. I do recall ordering the cream stuffed pears in a butterscotch sauce. The sauce alone could be a dessert- I believe I had drowned my fingers in it just so none was wasted. \n\nThe entire restaurant was covered with pink, white and red heart balloons. Every table had a red rose- and at the end of the night I was able to take 3 for the road. \n\nFrigale deserves 5 stars not only because their food was to die for, but despite the Valentine's Day rush- the service was superb.", "author": "Nathalie D."}

However, what I did eat was extremely tasty.  \n\nI had/tried:\nSalad with Basque crutons\nLamb stew (special)\nA tiny bite of creme brule, the almond cake, and the custartd tart thingie (yes, I believe that's its technical name)\n\nI wasn't paying the bill so I have no idea how spendy this place is.

Parking was easy, booking through OpenTable was easy, even traffic from the 'burbs was easy! \n\nI had the awesome crab appetizer, and DH had tomato soup and a salad. The crab was so good that our waiter noticed I'd scraped up all the drippings and bits from the plate and he made joke about it! The mister had duck as his main, which was served on a bed of really rich, really yummy lentils. (Seriously! Yummy lentils!) The waiter brought me a steak knife for my pork tenderloin and assured DH he wouldn't need a knife for his duck. He could have saved my knife, too, because the pork didn't need it either. Mmm, very tender. We shared the pan perdu for dessert, and it was a great ending to the meal: sweet, flavorful, and light.\n\nHope we'll get a chance to come back soon!", "author": "Kendra A."}

Angele's Gateau Basque- this almond torte and probably paired with a creme anglaise was the ultimate ending. \nso at the end, the server overheard us talking about his birthday, and brought out a plate with four chocolate truffles and a candle. how sweet :)", "author": "Abigail W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "This French Basque inspired restaurant is situated in South of Market on 4th Street and Brannon. Non-formidable from the outside and very chic and simple decor on the inside, I wasn't sure what to expect of the food as I walked in for a ladies night trying to stand straight in my high heels and tight skirt as an oh so ever \"pang of hunger\"  hit me (or Fringale as the french call it!). \n\nWhat the restaurant lacks in it's formality of space and small room, it makes up for in every delictable item on the menu. As an appetizer, I ordered the frisee salad with poached egg and bacon. It came with a light dressing and two small slices of  baguette on the side. I ate every bite.  For entree, the steak with pommes frites and green beans was a great choice. The Steak was mouth melting delicious and seasoned well. I also tried the duck confit with lentils, which was equally good in flavor. For dessert, our table ordered the creme brulee, lemon tarte, and angele's gateau basque. The angele's flaky and fresh almond cake was by far my favorite, but the lemon tart was a second favorite at our table. \n\nAnother plus was that when we walked into the restaurant, the staff greeted us immediately. I felt almost if I had entered a private party or someone's home. We dined early (6p.m.), which could have accounted for the extra attention. But as the restaurant filled up, the staff seemed equally attentive. One note is that the clientele is on the older side and not necessarily suitable for very loud parties. The restaurant tends to be more on the mellow side.  \n\nHowever, we found we didn't have to lower our voices, but expected to get a few smirks from our waiter  and nearby guests as we made quite a few dirty jokes. It was a b-day party after all!  Thus, the restaurant is very intimate in nature, so to speak. \n\nSpeaking of wine, the wines by the glass are not highly impressive and unfortunatley our table did not opt for a bottle. But, some wines of noteworthy mention were the syrah and medoc they serve by the glass. Both were light weight and floral and paired well with the flavorful dishes. \n\nMy french was a little rusty throughout the evening, but I still managed to find the bathroom comfortably, which is always a plus! I guess \"bathroom\" translates in every language. \n\n......So me and my tight skirt and uncomfortable heels are sure to return to this little gem of a restaurant in the future. I hope you will try it out too.", "author": "Laura L."}

The seating area is not so large, and the front door was hard to find for some reason.  We almost walked by it the 1st time.  It's a little tight, but if you get a window seat, you will enjoy your dinner.  Prices are quite good for the food+service combo.  \r\n\r\nI don't remember any of the dish's names, but the 2 appetizers we ordered were excellent.  They were challenging when we looked at the description, but quite tasty when we dug in.   \r\n\r\nI ordered the hangar steak, but apparently, the chef dropped it, so I had to wait quite a while for it to arrive.  lucky for us, they made sure to keep the other dish (salmon) warm so they come out at the same time at perfect temperature.  My steak was a bit \"tough\", something I normally do not prefer in steaks.  But I thought the taste was up to par atleast.  \r\n\r\nWe also ordered some dessert, and they fell in the standard taste category for me.  It was not exceptional like Fleur De Cocoa, but more on par with a smaller hole in the wall european pastry store.  \r\n\r\nI think 3 stars is too low, and 4 is too high, but Yelp doesn't let you do 3.5 stars, so I gave it a 4 because of my long wait for the dish.  Do I recommend it?  Of course.  Will I go back?  definately.\r\n\r\nI did feel a little uncomfortable due to the fact that we sat next to the window facing the street, and watched 2 possibly, homeless people arguing right in front of us for about 10 minutes.

We arrived a few minutes late for our 8pm reservation and the place was packed. We ended up waiting next to the door trying not to get squashed as people arrived. While we waited we had a couple of drinks from the bar (Kir Royale's because we're classy like that). In all we waited about 15 minutes, but during that time we were eyeballed by, I swear, Cruella Deville's exact opposite. Where Cruella was tall, thin, and had black hair with a white streak, her opposite was dumpy and sported white hair with a black streak. Tres bizarre (as they say in France).\n\nI had the beet salad with goat cheese (very nice) and warm chocolate Gourmand (excellent, but I'm a sucker for all things chocolate), while my fiancee ordered the sauteed prawns appetizer (she loved them) and Hazelnut mousse cake (great, maybe a little too buttery for our tastes). For the main course I ordered the pork tenderloin, but swapped with my fiancee who had ordered the Lamb Osso Bucco, but didn't like it (it wasn't what she was expecting).\n\nOverall we thought it was good, but not great.

I liked the toasted brioche that came with it more than anything else.\nEntrees: My friend's mussels were really good and garlicky but there was so much of it. I'd recommend the mussels only if you're going to be sharing your food family-style. My duck confit was great, the skin was crispy and the meat just fell off the bone, I didn't even need to use the knife that they provided.\nDessert: Hazelnut roasted almond mousse cake = heaven.

It was salad in the blandest sense of the word.\n\nCoq Au Vin: Worth it!  This dish was excellent.  My serving was perfect, though my companion's noodles were overcooked.\n\nApple Tart & Hazelnut Almond Cake: The tart was the star of the evening.  The cake was good, but there was something just a little less than fabulous about it.\n\nThe wine was good.  The waiters were there when they should have been and gone when they were not wanted.\n\nAll and all, Fringale is worth a try, but go for wine, a small, shared main course, and dessert.  Save your big French splurge for someplace else.", "author": "Margo C."}

I started out with the calamari appetizer, which was good. Not great, but good. However, it was nowhere near what I'd consider \"spicy,\" as the menu advertised it. My boyfriend had the crab ravioli and he didn't like it at all. I tried a piece of it (he didn't warn me beforehand) and it was COLD. Not even room temperature, COLD. I'm amazed he didn't send it back. Two of our friends had the ravioli as well and were definitely not impressed.\n\nFor main course, all five of us had the filet. The filet itself came exactly as ordered (medium rare) and tasted good, but the cabernet sauce was on it was nothing spectacular. My boyfriend remarked that he could make better filet. It came with fries, which is somewhat of an odd choice to go with a filet. While the fries had good crispiness, there was practically no salt or other seasoning on them. Because of this, they fell really flat. The meal also came with a \"salad\" that was basically a bit of spring mix with an ever so tiny bit of dressing. It was just a touch above inedible. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both had the hazelnut almond cake for dessert and it was just ok. We had a bite of our friend's chocolate cake and while not great either, it was better than ours. Upon receiving a bill for $115, my boyfriend remarked that he felt legimately ripped off for the food we received.. and I definitely agree with him. If this place is capable of serving great food, it was certainly NOT on display tonight. Isn't the point of Dine About Town to impress customers so that they come back to you?\n\nWe would definitely never come back here to give them another shot.", "author": "Michael M."}

With good service, a romantic ambiance, and wonderfully classic French fare, I definitely recommend it.\nBoth times my boyfriend and I came on Friday nights without reservation; despite a crowded restaurant, we spent 15 min at the bar with some wine and were seated promptly after.\nFor appetizers, we've tried the calamari (fresh from Monterey) with jalapenos and chorizo, which is extremely flavorful. The pineapple chutney also goes nicely with the foie gras appetizer.\nThe duck leg confit in the red wine sauce with lentils falls apart perfectly and is delicious traditional fare. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with caramelized onions is also wonderful.\nThe ambiance is romantic and the service good.  My boyfriend is French and likes that the ambiance and food feels like a simple and delicious restaurant back home - they don't try to be over-the-top cheesy French with pictures of the Eiffel Tower on the walls.\nI definitely recommend this for a nice night out, and even though we didn't make reservations, I would recommend that you do.", "author": "Britt M."}

As she was driving her expensive sedan, I could tell she was less than happy about heading southward of Mission. Luckily we found a spot right in front and two seconds later were embraced by this marvelous restaurant.\n\nFirst let me tell you about the waiters and other staff: so attentive without being intrusive, so warm and friendly without sitting on your lap and expecting to be waited on themselves. Pitch perfect!\n\nAnd then I have to tell you about the other diners. I have been struck each time I have gone there by how respectful the folks who choose this restaurant are of the small, cozy environment it offers. We were seated next to a table set for 12 and with great trepidation I watched the group approach us. That was the last time I noticed them. The restaurant's acoustics and the civility of the guests allow everyone to have a beautiful evening and nobody felt the need to raise their voices.\n\nNow...the food. The food is so special, so perfectly prepared, so delicately seasoned and so plentiful that you will want to sit there and wait for your next mealtime to arrive. It was days before I could stop thinking about the lamb reduction sauce that came with my rack of lamb or the total perfection of that lamb. We shared a cookie platter for dessert and were thrilled to discover it not only had at least a half dozen delicious homemade cookies, but also little truffles that melted in our mouths.\n\nI have never had anything less than superior, perfectly prepared and perfectly served food at Fringale's. I hope you won't either, because it is a treat not to be missed.\n\nPS: But please don't go there if you are the type who likes to balance wine bottles on your nose and scream across the room \"Garcon!\" There are other places you will like much better.\n\nPPS: Dear Fringale: Please bring back the heavy velvet curtain you used to have over the front door.

Like in France, the portions aren't massive, but were the right amount to be filling. I really enjoyed the duck confit and find that it's hard to find once close to what you'll get in France.

Partially my fault for ordering the pasta, which truthfully, just didn't look exciting, but I wasn't in the mood for heavy, dressed-up meats. I think I was picturing the perfection of the house-made fettucine from the Slow Club, which is always toothsome and scrumptuous.

The waiter didn't even bother asking us how things were once we had our mains.\n\nMy husband had the salmon for the main served with yummy shredded brussels sprouts and mashed potaters.

Tables are close together but does not impede conversation, but rather  gives a true French feeling to the ambience.  The waiters are lively and serve food with that passion for food that thrives in the French culture. The food is consistently good, the service fun and amicable, the wine list not extensive, but well selected. You never feel rushed.  Make reservations as space is limited.

You ask for a fork, what do they do... say \"okay\" and never come back with it.  Okay, so this happens everywhere.  But what gets to me was the fact that our waiter argued.  Even after you repeatedly said, \"it's fine, it's fine\".  Here's the kicker, he came back and argued some more.  I mean, come on!!\n\nThe only thing positive was the fact they kept refilling our water glasses without us asking for it.  \n\nWould I recommend this place?  I don't think so.

Prices are reasonable, probably not worth a huge trek, but if you are in the mood for French and are in downtown/SOMA area, not much better out there for the price.\n \n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n \nAmbiance/Atmosphere: 3.5 Stars.  Small, quaint, but well put together.  Fringale is tiny, and it fells that way too, but you will not feel crammed in cage or anything.  It helps create a good intimacy.  The place is borderline romantic if you are looking for a date place, and the acoustic level is acceptable so you can hear the person across from you speak.  Its a bit of an older crowd, and if you are looking for a trend setting place and want to be seen, this isn't the place.  Just the setting for a nice quality night out.\n \nService: 4 stars.  Our waiter was fantastic.  I am giving him an extra star for two reasons.  His recommendations were fantastic, and made the meal for a lot of us, and he dealt flawlessly with a table of 8.  WELL DONE!  Bread came on time, our wait for food was perfectly adequate.  All and all it was a job well done.  Given our table size it was hard for special attention, but I have no room to complain about that given the size of our party.  It seemed to that the staff had a great deal of comprehension over not only the menu, but the wine list.  Granted both are not overly complex, but it shows to me they want to take their job and your experience above the average.\n \nFood: 4.5 stars.  I think in general this is a four star for food.  Given them a nudge because both my app and entree were recommendations of the waiter and they were fantastic.  Also I tasted two other apps and three other entrees, all were very solid.  So lets begin.  I started off with the grilled calamari.  The waiter promised me it was the best in the city.  Well, he was right.  Are you kidding me this dish was out of hand, I was tempted to go back the next night and order this at the bar.  The squid was grilled perfectly in a very light sauce with jalapenos and some bell peppers and onions.  I also tried the beef carpaccio, which was very tasty, but really no need to order any other starter than the calamari.  Next I had the duck confit over green lentils.  This was very good, but not something that is going to blow you away (it was hard to follow up such a showing after the calamari).  It was about as good as duck confit could be, but I thought the lentil accompaniment was a bit bland.  I like the pork and the truffle risotto just a tad better than my duck.   We passed on desert, so no comment here.\n \nWine: 3 stars.  The wine list at Fringale is great, so don't be scared off by my three stars.  It is very small, very reasonable, and actually matches the food (thank you, this has become a big annoyance for me recently).  The staff has a great knowledge of the wine too.  I ordered a Sancerre and a Gigondas.  Both our waiter confirmed as being fantastic.  I would say they were very, very good, a bit shy of fantastic though (some call me a bit of a wine snob though).  But get this, the total for the two bottles: $74.  Not bad.   I think this could be four stars if they had just a couple more selections, and provide just slightly better glassware.  Overall, well done!!!!!\n \nOverall: 4 stars.  A great place for high quality French food, good French wine, and a fun atmosphere in Downtown/SOMA.  And best of all it will not put a huge dent in your pocket book.  In fact, this might be one of the better values in the area.  Check it out, you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Scott P."}

I wanted something different besides sushi (because that's pretty much all I love to eat) so we went ahead and chose Fringale. I 'm not a city person at all, despite living in NYC for 2 years, so I pretty much dread heading up where there is no parking, crowds everywhere and only one bathroom per restaurant where 60 people are eating (did I mention I don't like the city - Haha) but for this, I said why not?\nOur reservations were for 8 and we were promptly seated next to the window. Their pre-fix menu had a lot of choices so I was happy with that. I choose the Mussels, Coq Au Vin (I know its spelled wrong), and a Chocolate cake for dessert. \nWe end up ordering a bottle of nice Cab Sav, which was really nice and later a half bottle of a Pinot Noir which rocked me out. Their wine selection is really nice and nothing unrepeatable - Very impressed.\nThe mussels were a bit overcooked  and had little broth but it still had a nice flavor. My friend ordered the Butter lettuce salad and that was just kind of boring. \nMy entree was very nice. The meat was extremely tender and felt right off the bone. It wasn't in it's traditional pot but that was fine - I figure they were just trying to bang out dishes as fast as they could to keep up. My date had the Hanger steak with fries and that was very nicely prepared.\nMy dessert came out next and her's was an Almond Mousse. We actually ended up switching desserts but they were equally wonderful.\nOverall, the service was impeccable. Our waiter (can't remember his name but a 30's something man from France) was extremely pleasant and very accommodating. \nI felt very relaxed here, which is surprising since like stated above, I dread SF.

First off, I ordered me up a glass of the Cotes du Rhone (tasted like 2 buck chuck). 1st course, sauteed prawns with sundried tomatoes.  My dining pal, Lawrence T., had the chicken pate (think chicken spam).  I know there's something in their prawn sauce cuz before I knew it I had wolfed down all the bread on the table to sop it all up (i completely blanked out - is this what they call food euphoria/high?!?).  Stuffed before the 2nd course came. Then, my lamb shankies on a bed of veggies arrived . . . I took one bite and realized my body wasn't going to be takin' it.   The lamb was good, but too hearty after I had just gorged on all that prawn sauce. Lawrence T. got the soft & tender pork tenderloin served with jolly apples and cabbage - a much lighter dish.  Happily, an exchange was made.  For dessert, got the chocolate cake (can i ask why not bigger?) - deeelicious!  The other dessert was the hazelnut mousse thing - moussey part better than the cakey part. Overall 3.5, pretty good & anything served with a French accent is enhanced!", "author": "Peg S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-04", "description": "After walking past Fringale for the past two years, I finally stopped in for dinner on a recent Thursday evening.  I should have visited a long time ago, as Fringale offers some of the best food I have eaten in Soma.  Fringale was the first restaurant in the neighborhood I ate at and felt like the food and experience were absolutely worth what I paid.  \n\nOn the night I went, my family was out of town so I ate at the bar.  Fringale is a small place with tables situated close together and a small, four stool bar.  It looks like it would be a nice place for a romantic dinner/special occasion, or just for a regular night out.  It wasn't too crowded, but you will want to make reservations just to be safe, especially on the weekends.  \n\nI had the the charcuterie plate to start, which featured an excellent country pate and a very good duck rillette.  I ordered the roasted chicken breast for my main course and it was excellent.  The chicken was juicy and the skin was crunchy.  The mashed potatoes and Swiss chard also complimented the chicken well.  I finished the meal with the creme brulee, which was pretty good, although did not stand out from creme brulees offered at other nice restaurants.  The wine list was limited, but I was happy with the Sauvignon Blanc Fringale offered by the glass.  You can probably expect to pay about $100 for two people with two salads/starters, two main courses, dessert and wine.  Based on my experience, it is absolutely worth it.    \n\nAn added bonus to sitting at the bar was the opportunity to chat with the bartender/host, whose name I believe is Andre.  He is very friendly and works hard to accommodate guest requests (including running outside to hail a cab for a departing guest).  Several patrons came in and sat at the bar for dinner/drinks while I was there and Andre seemed to know them all by name.    \n\nI will definitely go back to Fringale.  My wife and I hadn't gone previously because my wife is vegetarian and the non-meat offerings are limited at Fringale (as with most French restaurants).  The menu does offer a vegetarian pasta dish.  Andre also said that the chef prepares a vegetarian dish featuring roasted vegetables on request, and occasionally Fringale offers risottos and other vegetarian dishes as specials.\n\nOverall, Fringale has great food and is a great value for the quality of the food you get and the neighborhood it is in.  I gave it four stars, but it should really be 4.5.  If the wine list had been more substantial, I would have given it the full 5 stars.", "author": "Daniel C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-27", "description": "After eating at Chou Chou's, I was thinking that all French restaurants could be the same... Boy, was I in for a surprise!!! Most importantly, if there is anything that being Asian-PacIslander has taught me, it is the following: if the sauce makes your rice taste better, then the dish is damn good. Fringale's sauces are so flavorful that it resonates in your mouth for at least a full minute and keeps you yearning for more. The thought just makes me close my eyes and say \"MMMMM!!\" and a lick of my pursed lips.\n\nSince I am the first to arrive, I decided to go check-in as well as do my mandatory skim of the restaurant. The bar is quite trendy. The restaurant is VERY small in size compared to the amount of tables and patrons. Space is very tight and people are practically sitting back-to-back. The lighting is very dim so I wasn't sure if I recognized anybody. The maitre'd said he'll seat me when the rest of my party arrive.   \n\nWe are mostly present (party of 7) and so we scoot, slide, shimmy, our way in between chairs and tables to get ours. The escorts are wonderful as they pull our chairs out for us (so chivalrous) and help us remove our coats. Since there is still one person missing form our party, we can't go over the menu. It seems that there is a huge lag time and we are quite hungry. The waiter brings us our waters and although it took forever, we ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter was very helpful in choosing our wine. As the men at the table said, \"He is Inspector Cloiseau.\" BTW, he is very french (no joke) and extremely friendly!. \n\nOnce we order SOMETHING, we also have our assortment of breads served to us pipping hot with REAL butter. And I mean REAL!!! It is creamy as heck and it retains it's shape. I'll say it now, it is THE BEST BUTTER that I have ever had. Our other friend finally arrives and so we can finally order. Though my friends are disappointed that they removed the Rib-Eye Steak from the DAT menu, they do find things that tantalize their tastebuds. We soon are served our wine which is light and slightly sweet (Muscadet Clos Les Montys).\n\nOnce our food orders were entered, service was very rapid. Since DAT is 3 courses for $31.00 p/p, our first course arrived. Most of us opted for the special appetizer of the night: The Lobster Bisque. Oh my goodness, we were all in heaven when we tasted this. It is a tomato-based soup with a dollop of cream (swirled in the middle of the little cup). The waiter puts some fresh ground pepper on top. The soup was accompanied with some toasted mini-baguette slices with what looked like a velveeta cheese spread. It was all YUMMY!!! Someone also ordered the sauteed prawns pastis with sundried tomatoes. Oh yes, the sauce on this baby was so buttery, garlicky and what ever else. Thank God for refills on the bread b/c we were dipping into each other's soups, sauces, etc. all night. Another person had the beef carpaccio which they enjoyed very much. At the end of the appetizer, ALL OF US were literally taking the breads and soaking whatever liquid we had left on the plates. Even better, one of the chefs or owners would walk around and smiled whenever he came by our table and I was screaming \"MMMMM!!!\" at every bite of anything. \n\nFor the main course, I choose the special for the night which was a white bean stew with proscuitto, ham, pork confit, and homemade sausage. Oh my!!!! I was floating on clouds at this point once I had that first scoop in my mouth. It was again a tomato-based stew and smoky pork-flavored. It seemed that everything was simmered to perfection. Every bite of pork melted in my mouth. The stew didn't seem fatty. Again, we were all dipping the bread into each other's dishes. The sauce on the Petrale Sole was again buttery and garlicky and whatever else. the sauce on the Lamb Osso Buco was also very good but a bit on the gamey side (I am not a lamb fan thought). The sauce on the Pork Tenderlon was also very good. I would order this next time I come or try the mussels. All of the portions were perfect size as we didn't have leftovers but were not left hungry. Again the chef or owner was quite pleased with my \"\"MMMS\" and \"AAAHHHs\".\n\nFinally, our desserts. I ordered the Pear tart. This was delicious, but what made it even more delicious was when you combine everything (the pears, the ice cream, the crust, the kiwi, and the strawberry) in my mouth. The mixture of flavors and textures made my eyes roll back in utter shock as to how good this was. I honestly do not know what they did to the kiwis and strawberries, but those by itself was savory enough. The Creme Brulee was good. The Hazelnut and Roasted Almond Mousse was also soft and silky, but rather sugary for my tastes. The coffee kicks a$$. Loved it so much I had 3 cups. \n\nWe loved our meal so much we were bopping to the beat of the French music as we left the restaurant. We had managed to stay for 3 hours. The staff was still friendly at the end of the night as well. Smiles!!!", "author": "Lorna D."}

I wanted fantastic food, impeccable service, and authentic tastes- all in one. I got average service with the waiter taking our food away before we had finished it, and subpar food, with the soup having too little salt and really too little flavor in general. I wouldn't shun this restaurant but I don't think I will ever willingly go back. Not awful, just definitely not worth 5 stars.", "author": "Nicole S."}

We all ended up tasting/sharing and most of the food was pretty good. The steak was great and the coq au vin was by far the best I've ever had. I was extremely disappointed in the overcooked, tasteless pork tenderloin and my friend was really unhappy with the tiny piece of yucky duck. My butter lettuce salad was good enough for me to make yummy noises (unusual for a salad!) and the mussel appetizer my boyfriend got was an extremely generous portion. I thought the desserts were just okay, not great.\n\nThe service was fine, but because the food ranged from \"fantabulous\" to \"meh\" I can only give this place three stars. I want consistently fabulous food. Fab-food, if you will. \n\nIf you go, get the coq au vin and be sure to have a reservation--the place is tiny.", "author": "Tracie L."}

Some of the dishes were spectacular, but others felt very below par for the cost of the food.\n\nIt was a Tuesday night for a large party (surprise party for that matter).  For a party of 13, we got our plates rather quickly, from appetizers to entrees to dessert.  For the size of the restaurant, they were nice enough to accommodate our large party.\n\nAs for the food...  The carpacio was alright, nothing spectacular about it.  The soup was rather cold, that was a surprise.  The Dungeness crab Napoleon was a must have, this was a very well prepared dish, very tasty.  I still think Foie Gras is best served seared IMHO.  The salmon I had for my entree was prepared very well.  Nicely seared on the outside to a crisp.  It was just right on the inside slightly moist and not dry at all.  Along with the lobster sauce it was spectacular.  Although I didn't have a chance to try the other entrees, I didn't hear many yays or boos at all from any of my fellow coworkers.  As for the dessert, the only thing memorable on the menu was the Hazelnut & roasted almond mousse cake.  The creme brulee had was on the cold side, meaning it had been sitting out for a while.  The same with another friend that had the creme brulee (which I ended up finishing also (OMGTHATSLIKE3000CALORIESPLUS3000CALORIES!?!?!GOTTAHITTHATGYMNOW).\n\nOverall I expected a lot, and was only partially satisfied.

Good wine, great company, cute environment, good service, bland food... that about sums up my experience at Fringale last night.  \n\nNestled away on 4th Street close to the ball park is Fringale, a cute and cozy French restaurant.  On a weeknight, street parking was easy - I parked only steps away from the restaurant.  The five of us were seated at a round table soon after our arrival.  The table looked small but it was surprisingly comfortable and perfect for conversations.\n\nOur waiter was efficient in taking our order and suggested a delightful, light red wine for us - Patricia Green Pinot Noir.  I ordered the Black Angus beef carpaccio served with capers, Etorki cheese & olive oil for appetizer, fettucine pasta with chanterelles, baby carrots, artichokes & parmesan cheese for entr\u00e9e, and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert.  The carpaccio was practically tasteless, despite the other ingredients in the dish.  I ordered the pasta mainly for the chanterelles, a flavorful mushroom.  But I was disappointed; that, too, was bland.  It basically tasted a little creamy/oily (read:rich) and that's pretty much it.  I had a bite of my friend's Veal Osso Bucco; that has a little more flavor to it - meat flavor - but pretty bland otherwise.  It was as if the chef ran out of salt in the kitchen and washed all the ingredients under the water 10x to rid them of flavor before cooking them.  The only decent part of my meal was the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e - creamy, just the right size and right amount of sweetness.  \n\nOverall, I still had a great night hanging out with my friends at an intimate, charming restaurant.  Just wish the food was a little more up to par.", "author": "Christine C."}

For mother's day dinner, it was squuuuished with tables where waiters barely had room to move around us. I was rubbing elbows with the nice lady at the table behind me. \n\nThe four of us (myself, the mother, the father, and the sister) started with three appetizers: 1) the calamari which is sauteed with slivers of chorizo and olives in a kind of oily sauce, 2) a crab salad beautifully presented in a tower, with tomatoes and avocado, and 3) pate-ish foie gras with orange marmalade, some greens, and toast. All of these were very very tasty. I think the first time I came, I also had the calamari and actually don't think I liked it much. Maybe because there was only two of us and only one appetizer so it was really heavy/salty.\n\nAs for entrees, the wait in between appetizer to entree was PAINFUL. It was probably like 20 minutes? We ordered something similar to a seafood bouillabaisse, but it was called something else, seafood basquaise? This was ok. I think I had this the first time I'd been here and seeing that I don't really remember...must've been not that memorable of a dish. I had the veal osso ruso. This is a big chunk of veal with bone still attached. Super tender, I found it a little salty and heavy, but wasn't too bad because I was sharing my family's entrees. They were sweet and substituted asparagus instead of fava beans for me, yay! It also came with some other veggies like broccolini and some rice pilaf (very little) kind of mixed into the sauce and veggies. The last entree was the mussels, which were very yummy! It had a pesto sauce with some garlic and onions. There were a lot, but it really was more of an appetizer than entree. It only came with a couple slices of crostini. We got some of their pomme frites to go with it. These fries were pretty good, but it kind of seemed like we got the bottom of the barrel for these...most of them were pretty brown and pretty short fries, rather than the nice long, golden fries I saw at other tables. On request, they gave us some aioli to eat with it, which was good.\n\nMy favorite part was the dessert. I was super excited to find out that they had profiteroles as their special dessert! Profiteroles are like cream puffs with ice cream instead of cream. It's a little pastry puff cut in half and ice cream put in the middle! They drizzled some chocolate on top and Christine is one happy little camper. I'd never seen this before, but even the puff pastry was chocolate flavored. They put plain vanilla ice cream in the middle, which went very well with the chocolate. YUM. It comes in three and I think I ate 2 and 1/2...the other half was for my mom, dad, and sister. We also got this warm chocolate cake with some berry compote, pretty good. Lastly, we got homemade truffles...mm dark chocolate goodness. It also came with some cookie/biscuit-y things to complement the truffles.\n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable meal. I think the appetizers, the mussels, and the profiteroles really stood out to me. The waiter switched our bill with the table next to us (150 vs 250, ours being the cheaper!) and I luckily checked the bill!! Anyway, our table was ready when we arrived on time to our reservation. Service was fairly attentive, but not amazing. Got cozy with the neighboring table, but maybe because it was Mother's Day? Food was enjoyable, but is it memorable without me writing it down on yelp? Maybe not because I hardly remember my first time here. 3.5 stars if I could.", "author": "Christine L."}

The food was fantastic (butternut squash soup, ribeye, roasted chicken, creme brulee). The evening environment was solid ... not exactly elbow-to-elbow coziness but no tumbleweeds rolling through either. As a restaurant-goer, I'm low maintenance - I order quick, never complain about the food, pride in being polite/respectful, enjoy the food, and tip well.\n\nBut the one thing I had issue with at Fringale was the service. Again, it may be hard to put into words but our waiter (seemingly nice chap with moustache and requisite French accent) sprinkled in some off-putting remarks and slightly uncomfortable vibe throughout the evening.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhen ordering our appetizer (butternut squash soup), my GF ordered first and asked for it. OK. But then, when it was my turn, I said, \"The butternut sounds delicious, I'll order that too.\" The waiter responded, \"Well, that's our ONLY soup so you can't get anything else.\" Huh? Where did that come from? Thinking it was the dry French \"humor\" I let it go ... even though it was clearly snide.\n\nThen after completing our meal, the waiter ambled over and asked, \"Are you done?\" ... and my GF said, \"Yes, but I'd love to see the dessert menu.\" Again, the waiter responded, \"You may have never been to a French restaurant before but we CLEAR the table before we bring the dessert menus.\" Again, huh? Where did that come from? At this, I sighed and I guess he got the message ... quickly clearing the table, swiping the cloth clean, and scurrying off. The dessert and subsequent bill went smoothly (but the waiter said nothing; no \"enjoy\" or \"thanks\").\n\nAgain, the interactions were brief. But I understand humor and wit. And I understand condescension. And this waiter's attitude was clearly leaning towards the latter. He went the extra mile to make pretentious remarks ... certainly did not ruin the evening (thankfully, this wasn't a \"date\") or the delicious meal but made us think twice about frequenting the restaurant again. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm being overly sensitive but it's that gut feeling, you know? Look, I get it. French = French, especially when it comes to the food.

The red wine sauce was very good, even though I usually like my steaks plain. \n- Hazelnut & roasted almond mousse cake - Probably my favorite part of the meal. I am a sucker for hazelnut and this was very rich and had a long hazelnut aftertaste! Great with coffee.\n\nMy only complaint is that the 5 of us (some of who were very tall) were seated at a table that probably only should have seated 4 small to mid sized people.

We decided to order the calamari and the prawns.  The calamari was alright .  I definitely suggest trying the prawns!  It had a lot of colorful flavor and was so fresh.  \n\nEntree\nI had the pork tendorloin while my companion choose the Australian sea bass in lobster reduction.   The presentation was very well done for both dishes.   My pork was very very tender.  Although I have to say that the pork was a little lite on flavoring.  The Austrailian Sea Bass is definitely the dish to get!  The sauce was phenomenal.  Added to the sauce, you have greens, sliced potato beds, and mushrooms to complete the experience.  \n\nDessert\nWe decided to share the house variety sorbet.  It wasn't to my liking especially for dessert because it was so tart.  I believe the sorbet was apricot and strawberries with cherrie puree.  The sorbet was also served with two cookie swirls to complement to tart flavoring with a bit of crunchy texture.  Neither myself nor my companion really enjoyed it.  \n\nOverall, I'd say its a 4 star and I certainly will go back.

What I like most about the Fringle is not the food but the service, which I will give 3.5 stars.  I went to Fringle for the first time about 6 years ago. Over the years, I have gone there probably once a year on average.  Every time I was impressed by the quality of the services.  The service is always proper, polite and warm.  Somehow they have a way of maneuvering in that small space efficiently and don't make it seem too busy.  And to me, more importantly is that they don't try hard to rush you out.  On a busy night they may drop a hint or two, but you won't ever feel that pressure.  That makes my dining experience relaxing and I can really enjoy the food.  \n\nThis past Saturday when I went, I noticed that the menu has changed a little. The mussel is now an entree.  I didn't order it, but I did ask the waiter about it. He told me it has only the basic ingredients - garlic, wine, a little bit of salt - the most simple and dependable recipe.  I would recommend that if you are in the mood for basic and classic French cuisine.  I had the seafood \"basquaise\", which is decent but not exciting.  For desert, we had the Chocolate truffle.  That impressed me. It was freshly-made chocolate!  I strongly recommend it.", "author": "Xiaobei F."}

My brother's organic chicken was the best I've ever had, tender and super crispy skin!  The steak and veal shank were great too.  The only bad dish in the bunch was my sister's rigatoni.  I don't expect fab pasta at a french restaurant, but we expected more since the app ravioli was really perfect.  Anyway, nice cheese plate and charcuterie for starters, although these did not go too far with 6 people.  Each would feed 3-4 as apps.  skipped dessert as birthday cake was waiting nearby.  oh and did i mention the wine??  yummy Saint Emillion.  Wine markup was pretty reasonable.

The waiter was spot-on with his wine recommendation, and we had a great meal and great service. It's a small cheerily lit place. It was an interesting mix of romantic/family/business groups. I had the crab and julienne vegetable ravioli in lobster bisque, sole with risotto for an entree, and hazelnut almond mousse cake for dessert. The ravioli was light and I ended up adding a little salt. The lobster bisque was more like gravy, and I could only taste lobster when I tried it alone. It didn't add too much to the ravioli. The crab and julienne carrots were delicious, however. The sole was lightly pan fried, and the risotto was amazing. It was in some sort of lemon scented butter sauce, and I could have eaten it all night. The almond hazelnut mousse cake was heavenly, but I am not hard to please when it comes to all things hazelnut. My date had a plate of cured meats to start, the coq au vin, and a chocolate ganache cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The wine reduction on the Coq au Vin was flavorful and rich, but the chicken was a little dry. The waiter was a little snooty, and even when my date correctly identified his accent as Quebecois, he wouldn't be our friend. I assumed that the waiter would be excited to have a French speaking customer, but that is because I am from a small town where people still get excited about foreigners and accents, but in SF it's really no big deal. He also constantly tried to steal our wine menu no matter how many times we asked him to leave it. It almost stopped us from ordering wine with dessert, but we persisted.", "author": "Merrilee T."}

I didn't see anything I liked on it.  The main entree selection for DAT was between petrale sole, osso bucco, or fettuccine so I ended up just ordering from their normal menu.  I started with the foie gras and ordered the PEI mussels as my entree.  I asked the waiter if came with anything.  He suggested that I order it with...what I thought at the time he said was a side of rice...but when arrived, he actually said \"a side of fries\".  I guess I should have known better that a french restaurant wouldn't be serving rice.  How fobby am I?  Anyway, the foie gras was huge - like a giant slice of pate.  I almost confused it for pate when it arrived.  It came with 6 pieces of toasted brioche.  I enjoyed it.  The mussels were extremely garlicky and vinegary.  If you like that that combination, go for the mussels though heed warning that you'll probably be hungry again in a few hours. BF ordered the sauteed prawn pastis and the ribeye steak.  The prawns were excellent.  Whatever sauce they use is very good.  Ribeye was nothing spectacular.  \n\nOverall I had a pretty good meal but was sorely disappointed by the service.  Maybe it was because we came on a Friday night or maybe it was because our waiter seemed like a novice but I felt like we were not tended to enough.  I'm not some attention whore who needs it all the time but the waiter didn't even check on us once.  We had to cue him when we wanted to order, when we needed our plates removed, and even when our beverage glasses were empty.  I understand it was a busy night but a quick \"is everything all right\" would have been nice.  I observed him for a while and noticed that he didn't do it with any of the other tables either.

My friends and I are all nearing 30, we are not that young, but we were obviously the youngest people in the place.  They obviously cater to older clientele.  First it was ordering tap water, not bottled, or wine or a cocktail, how dare we!  Then when it came time for me to order I asked for one of the first courses and a side as my meal.  I asked, is that ok?  Hello, of course it's ok why did I even ask?  I just knew he was not going to be happy with my selection.  Well, the waiter gave me such attitude and made a phhhrummpph noise down the back of my neck.  How dare I not order both a starter and a main course!  Hello, both of them together equaled the price of many of the main courses, chill out!\nThe food was decent.  The calamari was non breaded in a sauce with jalapenos and chorizo.  Very tasty, minus the bodies, I only like the rings.  I also had the pomme frites.  Horrible!  They were soggy and cold.  They came with no dipping sauce, ketchup, nothing.  I never saw the waiter after, so I couldn't ask for some.  I would have rather had fries from McDonalds.  We had the almond mousse cake for dessert.  It had that greasy on the roof of your mouth consistency and tasted like cookie dough.  Not very pleasant.  Everyone else seemed to like their food fine.  The salads were good, and big portions.

I tried my friends' oysters and they were pretty good. I'm not a fan, but I think the sauce made that dish. Main course was steak with pommes frites. The steak was cooked well but it was a tiny portion. The fries were the highlight because they were thin and crisp - just the way I like it! Dessert was scrumptious. I had a chocolate cake that was decadent, while my friend had a hazelnut dessert which felt like it had granules of sugar in each bite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-17", "description": "I'm wanting to give Fringale a 5 star rating but...5 stars to me exemplifies ULTIMATE service and quality.  Service was definitely 4 stars and the food...well, including tonite it's been pretty consistent and I love the fact that this is a \"neighborhood\" french restaurant b/c it's literally 3 blocks from my place and it serves up good food consistently.  \n\nTonite I started w/ my staple Fringale Frisee salad w/ warm bacon dressing and bits, poached egg, and toasted levain (toast!)...a great winter salad with enough tangy/tartness from the dressing to bridge over to a spring salad starter.  For wine pairing I'd recommend a full-bodied sauvignon blanc or a medium body chardonnay w/ good acidity to carry out the flavors.  My entree was a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with braised savoy cabbage and carmelized onion sauce.  The pork was nice and tender and juicy. The carmelized onion sauce and savoy cabbage offset the saltiness of the bacon nicely.  The wine I'd recommend would be a burgundy or a young pinot noir with evolving fruit and a bit of acidity to complement the the sauce of the pork.  Dessert was \"Pain Predu au Chocolat et Bananes\" (bread pudding w/ chocolate and bananas).  Usually if the dessert menu has bread pudding or some type to puff pastry like a galette, I need not look further.  As far as my scale of bread pudding goes, this one gets a 3.5.  I like that fact that it was bitter-sweet chocolate and the pudding was moist and somewhat chewy.  However, it didn't \"wow\" me and I barely tasted the bananas.\n\nAs far as logistics like parking...you can park at the Wells Fargo parking lot across the street if there's available space, otherwise street parking which can be a lil challenging.  The wine list isn't very extensive but offers interesting options.  They don't have a sommelier so your recommendations will come from your server, which can be hit or miss.\n\nFringale definitely deserves 4.5 stars.  In order to get that half point nudge up, they need to expand their wine list, have a lil more attentive service, and offer up some \"wow\" entrees.", "author": "Rick P."}

I also had the Spinach with Roquefort which was just alittle too strong for me but it was exactly what they said it was.  My dad's duck was cooked perfectly.  Dessert was the only slight dissapointment - the Pain perdu au chocolat et bananes wasn't as good as expected but the Glace vanille sauce chocolat \nHouse made vanilla ice cream topped with hot chocolate sauce and whipped cream more than made up for it.  the special which was a Christmas log was good, nothing spectacular.

Then is the organic chicken dish, sometimes is basquaise,, sometimes is organic chicken breast with side dish either way is great. \nI have to say this is the one place that gives a very good name to French restaurants. Their portions are good size (not too big not tiny!). The service is great but not pushy. The price is just right, for portion, quality of food and service. \nAny soup that I got here is great. and I like their vegetable salad, very healthy and tasty. It is cooked vegetables with vinaigrette (sounds simple but it is very tasty) \nOverall, it is one of my favorite places, and I go back again and again. \nBut the only thing is it is very small place and so keep that in mind. \noh I forgot my other favorite dish is the appitizer: Roquefort & spinach ravioli,sooooo good. \nI think that is it for now! :-)", "author": "Nina Z."}

This rendition included perfectly bite-sized pieces of frisee with healthy chunks of bacon.  Very good, with the attention to detail one might expect at this price point.  A very generous portion, although the acid went out of balance lower in the bowl.\n\nPlats/Main:  I had the pork, which had delicately balanced flavors overall.  My dining companion's chicken was outstanding, with each perfectly trimmed piece cooked to juicy perfection.  To be honest, I can't recall much about my main because dessert....\n\nDessert:  Fantastic, and the best value of the menu.  Really the highlight of the meal, with a Gateau Basque and a Chocolate Gourmand both beautifully presented and exquisitely executed.  The Gateau featured a smooth custard filling redolant of whole vanilla inside a rich and dense almond tart.  The Gourmand was the \"chocolate lava\" cake taken to a whole new level -- with an outstanding presentation and a melted chocolate center that still expressed the spicy complexities of fine chocolate.  \n\nI'm reserving my highest praise for the ambience at the price point was a bit lacking, although the service was excellent and the epitome of professionalism.    4.5 stars, but stay for dessert!", "author": "Greg K."}

I was with four others, and we each were not embarassed to try each other's meal.  The almond-crusted sea bass was absolutely phenomenal, and I have to say was probably the best fish I've had in a decade.  The saffron sauce accompanying I thought might be too overpowering, but it was exquisitely delicate and rounded out the almond crust quite nicely.  Even more surprising was the combination of chanterelles and the sauce. Wow.  The rack of lamb was outstanding and perfectly cooked; just two ribs, though.  The potato gratin accompanying was good, but had a slightly bitter taste.  Also tried the coq a vin, which literally melted in your mouth.  Another shine was the crispy skinned chicken - it had a very delicate almost lemon-pepper taste, and the skin perfectly crunchy.  \n\nThe deserts were all amazing as well.

It is French bistro food without too many cliches, offers snappy service, and a dependable food experience. The wine list could be longer, but what they have is well chosen and there are some gems like the Paillard Champagne and great Rhone reds. \nThis restaurant seems to get some bad reviews here and there from the usual befuddled set who do not know sweetbreads from brains, not that they have much of it.

Tonight was my 6th time there, and my 3rd time taking advantage of their Dine About Town special. Fringale means \"the urge to eat\" in French, and that is what going there entails, in the most pleasurable of ways. The Dine About Town prix fixe, at $31.95, is a steal since a normal dinner runs $44. Three choices are offered for the first course: soup du jour (or in this case, de la nuit, which was a potato garlic soup), beef carpaccio with a mustard sauce & crispy horseradish, or sauteed prawns in pastis with sun dried tomatoes. I had the carpaccio, which was as artfully presented as it was delicious. Three cylindrical leaves of chive formed a teepee above the crispy horseradish and tiny spinach leaves salad in a sea of beef carpaccio. As I remarked to my friend, I could've eaten 5 more plates of this, but it was probably for the best, as we had our entrees and desserts to come, and the portions at Fringale are just right. Three choices again for the entree: sauteed ling cod (not really a cod, but a greenling) with white asparagus, lobster coulis, and a little bit of mashed potatoes; confit of duck leg with green lentils du Puy (French green lentils are grown in the Puy region); and Black Angus rib eye steak with red wine butter & pommes frites. I had the ling cod, which tasted great, and of course, the lobster coulis is so delicious, I mopped it up with some bread. My friend had the duck confit, and it was very earthy, rich, and delicious. Fringale is so cool, they offer every dessert on their dessert menu as part of the Dine About Town prix fixe (though I doubt the cheese plate is available). They were out of the apple tart, even though I had an 8PM reservation! So I ordered the Tarte Tatin de poire aux aromates (Carmelized Star Anise spiced pear), with vanilla ice cream. It came with tiny diced pineapples, a small sliver of mango, and a small sliver of strawberry, as well as a dusting of sugar on the plate. The ice cream came with shaved almonds, a nice touch. The tarte tatin was yummy, and it was a nice dessert, not too much, not too little. My friend ordered the creme brulee, which was quite good. Fringale changed its chef, and new chef Thierry Clement is doing a great job at maintaining Fringale's ability to impart \"the urge to eat\" on diners!", "author": "Hao L."}

This is especially impressive given that, unlike some participant menus, the normal  prices at Fringale are HIGH (though **mostly** worth it).  I chose the prawn app - spicy prawns in a creamy, flavorful sauce featuring sun-dried tomatoes.  I forgot that I had a steak coming, and ate all the prawns and sopped up every spot of sauce with the bucket of french bread on our table. By the time I was full, my rib eye arrived, served with a side of pommes frittes.  I generally enjoy lean cuts of beef, so was initially taken aback at the gristle on the rib eye. My date, however, instructed me to cut off the gristle and enjoy the middle... SO GLAD I DID.  The meat was so flavorful, with just enough seasoning.  I have to agree with a previous yelper that the fries weren't the greatest... dry, no real flavor.  My date ordered the lamb and was sort of disappointed. I would have been too. Although the meat had a great flavor, it was less-than-appetizing looking, and was served with a meager stew of cabbage, potatoes and carrots.  There also seemed to be a lack of edible meat on the shank itself.  Probably his fault for not sending it back.  Luckily, I had an ENORMOUS steak, and my date split my dish with me (enjoying every morsel).  Desert on  my end was the warm chocolate cake.. you probably can't go wrong with warm choc. cake.. but YUMMMY!  Wine / wine service was great too.  In fact, all service was great.

We stopped by here at around 6pm on a Saturday and were able to sit at the bar. We started of with half a bottle of pinot noir and french onion soup. The  soup was delicious, a great start to a wonderful meal to come. I ordered Hawaiian Mongchong and my boyfriend  got the mussels. Both dishes were very tasty. The fish came with mushroom sauce and fingerling potatoes and I finished every little piece of it stopping myself from actually licking the plate ( I don't think our waiter would have appreciated that)  I tried some mussels as well and i have to say they are the best mussels I had in a while.  For dessert we had hazelnut mousse and coffee. The service was impeccable even at the bar. The noise level was pretty low so it was easy to carry a conversation.  Everyone there is very attentive and of course speaks French. Lovely restaurant for a romantic meal. Next time we will probably call ahead to make reservations and sit at the table though. I highly recommend this restaurant   if you plan to be in SOMA.", "author": "Maria V."}

Robust wine list (and not even a hint of a snicker from the French waitstaff when we selected a California cabernet.)  Intimate, albeit borderline cramped, atmosphere.  Did I say mouthwatering?  We visited for Valentine's Day Dinner and had some spectacular cuisine.  Best meal all year!  (OK, we're only 6 weeks in.)  As amuse-gueule, the carrot soup was even ahead of my heretofore favorite recipe.  The foie gras with pineapple chutney and Petrale Sole stuffed with scallops and shrimp were quite good, but the avocado-laced crab Napoleon and Black Angus filet mignon were truly amazing.  And the bread - we couldn't stop noshing on it!  For the finale, the chocolate & raspberry heart topped all cocoa this year, whilst the sorbets surpassed all in a lifetime.  I still wonder how they could possibly stuff such rich fruit -- including overpoweringly intense mango -- into frozen water?", "author": "Scott A."}

We originally made reservations for 7, but last minute my bf decided to come. They had no problem with seating 8 instead of 7 so that was good. They were very nice and courteous. We came here because of the Dine About Town which is the greatest idea ever! (Kudos to whoever thought of the whole idea!) I had the Mussels for the first course which were sooooo delicious! My second choice was the salmon which was okay. They put a lot of lemon juice on it, which I don't particularly like. For the last course, I chose to go with the apple tarte with vanilla ice cream. That was yummy as well! We actually hadn't told the waiters that it was our friend's birthday, and we started singing happy birthday when our desserts came. Our waiter then came out with some truffles and a candle as he had heard us singing. I don't know why we hadn't thought of telling them before hand. But they were very nice!

Yes I'm all about the internet so I made my reservation on Opentable.com and asked for a table by the window (tip it gets really warm and it's a small place, best table is by the window in the corner. Has the most space between tables). So they call to confirm and the waiter with the French accent has that \" French I could care less what you we assures me he would try. When we arrive score we got a window table. Our waiter was great and the food was terrific. We got the calamari with Chorizo and olives. The calamari was done sooo perfect, tender not rubbery at all. I got the lamb which was cooked exactly as I asked for and my gf's seafood dish was tasty.

From roasted peppers that melt in your mouth, to unbelievably fresh pan roasted calamari, to mouth watering cuts of meat - food at this SOMA treasure just blew all my other gourmet dining experiences in the city out of the water. Attentive wait staff (with an entertaining French accent) took care of us very well. It was my wife's birthday - I had mentioned this while making the reservation. Without any awkward gestures or prodding, the server brought us a complimentary custard creme puff plate with a birthday candle just as we were getting ready to order desserts!

The timing of her service was perfect:  she niether neglected nor hovered over us.  She offered good suggestions about wine and food.  The drinks were served promptly and acompanied by a basket of good fresh bread.  Food took a little while which is to be expected for freshly made excellent food.  The wine reduction for my canard magrets was truly perfect - don't know that I've ever had such a perfect sauce before - though perhaps there could have been just a little more of it.  and the minced vegetale with it was just the perfect touch and taste.  My companions had the duck confit, steak, and pork wrapped in bacon -- all of which were reported to be very very good.  At the very end there was a slight hint that some folks were waiting for tables, but otherwise the servcie was great.  The prices were very reasonable for the excellent qualityof the food and service, especially compared to elsewhere in the city.  I rarely eat out (except when on vacation) because I often feel ripped off and I am made to feel that I am doing the restaurant a service.  Fringales for me is a treat.

We had hoped for an enjoyable dinning experience but all night we felt somewhat rushed by the waiter (asking us for our order directly after we sat down, etc). After we had finished our main course and were enjoying our champagne, WE WERE ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE WAITING FOR THE TABLE. WE HADN'T EVEN LOOKED AT THE DESSERT MENU YET!! I have never been treated so rudely and inappropriately in a restaurant. And to call themselves a French/Basque restaurant is an utter disgrace. The food may be good, but San Francisco is filled with excellent restaurants that treat their guests properly .The owner has his priorities completely backward.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-07", "description": "I was very disappointed especially after reading all these great reviews. First was the environment. The table we were first seated at had gnats and flies circling and hanging out on the window...and I'm not just talking about 1-2. There were many gnats with one taking a sip out of my cup of water. Second was when they moved us and they never apologized. Instead the wait staff just made a joke out of it and that was the end of that. And to top it off, there were gnats at the table we were moved to because of old flowers sitting in a tin vase right next to the table. So at that point I just wanted a good meal and didn't get it. Apps were good, but then it went downhill from there. I would recommend Bistro Liaison in Berkeley over this place every time. Better food, prices, service and ambiance there compared to Fringale.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-12-02", "description": "I had a very special occasion dinner last night at Fringale -- what USED TO be my favorite SF restaurant.  I had let the restaurant know about this special birthday dinner in advance, but alot of good that did.  When we walked in, we stood there for approx 10 minutes without being acknowledged.  When I asked the bartender if the host was around, he told me to \"just be patient...\"  We were seated by the harried host who spoke not a word to us.  The waiter, though cute with his French accent, did not know the house wine list AT ALL.  Repeated requests for water - after ordering it initially and re-requesting it- went unacknowledged.  Although we were clearly ready to order wine, they threw our entrees down on the table, long before we had anything to drink with them.  The food was quite good, but the service really lacked. There was no acknowledgement of the birthday person's special day, after confirming and reconfirming the occasion with the restaurant - who gave us a mediocre table by the way.  We ordered one dessert to share, which they did bring with a birthday candle, but then charged us for it - something I thought tacky as the bill was well over $200.  I had pulled the waiter aside away from the table and given him my credit card, asking him to handle this stealthily so the birthday person (my Dad) would not try to pay.  At the end of the evening he threw the bill down in front of me while all were watching - really badly handled - defeating the point of trying to avoid the struggle for the check.   I rarely tip less than 20% - there has to be a reason - but I did less last night..  No excuse for the waiter not knowing the basics about their featured wines.  Maybe Fringale has become a victim of it's own success? The harried host might need to find another line of work if he is in the weeds on your average Saturday night.  While the food was still excellent, there is no excuse for such a slipshod performance by what was one a stellar restaurant.", "author": "Sue M."}

Dinner was fantastic - everyone loved their food. Calamari, crab and avacado salad, duck confit and venison were the highlights. The Merry Edwards Pinot was a perfect complement, and we finished with a lovely cheese plate. Our waiter was charming and attentive but not overbearing. Towards the end of the meal, it got quite crowded - a large party that they were seating at an enormous table which they created by bringing in a huge piece of plywood top running the length of the restaurant on top of their regular tables . This was a bit annoying...I got hit in the head with table linens as they put out the tablecloth and one of my colleagues got a pretty good hit to the back with a chair. The waiter brought our bill (~$750 for 7 of us) - told us \"no rush\". We enjoyed the last of the cheese plate, the 3rd of our bottles of wine, coffee and port when the manager came over and announced that he needed the table. No apology, no \"please\" . Though I had a wonderful dinner the final experience left a really bad taste in my mouth. To his credit, our waiter came over as we were leaving and apologized, but, there are a lot of great restaurants I would go back to before visiting Fringale again.", "author": "Cathi A."}
