So definitely be there when it opens especially on a weekend evening! \nThe service was great. Our waiter explained the menu and was able to answer our questions about all the different menu items and different types of pastas. \nThe house red wine was pretty good. The Brussels sprout, prosciutto and ricotta appetizer was delicious. I ordered The cavatelli with white beans and chicken sausage and it was SO SO good. Super fresh with beautiful flavor. My husband had the bucatini all' amatriciana which was also good but it does have a Smokey flavor from the pancetta which I am not a huge fan of. But if you love pancetta you would probably love this dish. \nThe only thing  I didn't love - the tables are very close together - like two inches apart. \nDefinitely would recommend!", "author": "Lauren Z."}

I ordered the pasta with pesto and pine nuts after our waiter raved about how popular this dish was. I loved that the pasta tasted like it was freshly homemade. But other than that, it was super disappointing! It really lacked flavor, seemed under-salted, and was watery rather than creamy as it was described. The portions were really small and the waiter didn't tell us this when we ordered. We found ourselves at the restaurant next door ordering more food right after we left. \n\nIt's quite sad the food and drinks were a miss for me because I love the outdoor seating, the bar, the location, and just about everything else about a Mano.", "author": "Sarah B."}

The menu is straightforward and their recommendation is one atipasti, a pizza, and a pasta to split between two. The sizing is right for just one person, so don't expect to get carboloaded out here. \n\nThe pricing reflects the quality of ingredients and cooking, which is pretty affordable considering it's in SF. The tagliatelle with chanterelle mushrooms and onions were great, but the highlight of the night was definitely the Monterey Squid with beans! I've never seen bean incorporated into a dish so perfectly before. It provided all the right textures and flavors to balance out the meal. \n\nThis place gets busy, so be sure to come early.

We came around noon on a Sunday and were seated immediately on the patio. We decided to order family-style so we could try a few things and everything was so good - I'd definitely order it all again. For four people (2 guys and 2 girls) four entrees was enough - we could have done 5 to be completely stuffed. \n\n- Tagliatelle al pesto, haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, pine nuts ($16): Very light-tasting and unique; the pine nuts, green beans, and thinly-sliced fingerling potatoes added a delicious crunch and texture. \n\n- Margherita, tomato, fior di latte, basil pizza ($12): Delicious! Super thin crust and perfect amount of sauce. A margherita pizza done right is absolute perfection and they do it well here! \n\n- Rigatoni pork sugo ($14) with fried egg ($2): My favorite dish we ordered. Very rich and decadent sauce that balanced well with the rigatoni noodles. \n\n- Fried chicken with polenta and fried egg: Not sure if this was a weekend special, but the fried chicken was perfectly cooked and crispy. \n\nOverall, worth trying this place if you're in Hayes!

For a table of 3/4 we wait about an hour, though we were quoted an hour fifteen to an hour and a half.\n\nWe ended up getting a free wild arugula salad as someone misordered or something happened, but the salad ended up just tasting okay, nothing really special that I couldn't find in a salad that was boxed up at Trader Joe's or something.\n\nMy friend and I shared the duck pate mousse and it was a bit of a disappointment. The bread tasted like sliced bread from Boudin and the pate wasn't really all that special, it could have been made much more fluffy with a better tasting jam on top.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night though was the tagliatelle with pesto. We'll start off with the good parts of the dish: the pasta tasted freshly made and had a great texture. By itself it was a high quality pasta  that was well made.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn't enough to carry the blandness of the whole dish. The whole thing lacked flavor and depth and needed quite a bit more seasoning in general. It was such a boring dish, as if I had just grabbed a jar of pesto and mixed it with plain pasta and nothing else (there were other items in the dish but they didn't add anything flavorwise). \n\nThe big redeemer of the night though was the cocktail! I had the Sirena and it was very well made, with a nice grapefruit flavor, and a small kick in it to make the drink very pleasant while not being too boring.\n\nProbably won't be back with the line, though I might give it another shot if there is a short wait some time.", "author": "Tyler T."}

However it doesn't feel too claustrophobic, probably because of the high ceilings and windows to let some light in (when there is sunlight).  Given how busy it was, the service was quite good- they were very good at bringing out the food quickly without feeling too rushed and filling up our water glasses.  Our waiter made some excellent recommendations, especially with the pastas (their specialty).  \n\nFood:\n-- Cauliflower, lemon, chili, bagna cauda ($8) - I'm not a big cauliflower fan, but these were roasted pretty well and the flavor was great.  Chili was very slight so it doesn't burn your tongue, and the lemon added a great acidity to the dish.\n\n-- Margherita Pizza (tomato, fior di latte, basil)($12) - one of the few times I've seen margherita pizza done quite well!  Also one of few times I ate the entire pizza, crust and all.  The crust is very thin but not to the point where it gets soggy from the sauce and cheese, and overall not super heavy / greasy.  Very clean to the palette.  Great for sharing between 2 people (assuming you are ordering pasta also).  \n\n-- Tagliatelle al pesto (haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, pine nuts)($16) - the waiter recommended this one.  While I usually don't go with pesto pasta period, this one was quite delicious!  The haricot verts and pine nuts gave more crunch to the dish, and the sauce was wonderful since it didn't sit too heavily in your stomach and tasted fresh.  The pasta was cooked a tad over al-dente, but didn't mind it since it had the nuts and haricot verts.\n\n-- Bucatini all' amatriciana (tomato, pancetta, pecorino)($15) - this one is a much heartier pasta dish, especially with the pancetta and pecorino.  Think I would have preferred a little less pecorino since it came out slightly salty, though the tomatoes were able to cut that saltiness a bit.  The bucatini was cooked al-dente and you could tell it was homemade by the chewiness of the noodle.  \n\nOverall I'd say it was worth the wait (maybe because we were starving by then).  It may take a while to be able to nab a table here, but it's a great place to get quick Italian comfort food, especially pasta, in Hayes Valley.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The pasta also had that perfect bite to it and the pine nuts added a nice crunch. The bf's pork rigatoni was a little watery but flavorful.

I got the funghi campanelle, one friend got the rigatoni, and the other two each got the bucatini. We each really enjoyed our dishes. The funghi in particular was very unique - I really loved the creamy texture.

We ordered the fontina arancini to start, which are basically fried risotto balls, and they were SO good!! I would highly recommend ordering those, and for our entrees I got the tagliatelle (w/ pesto + pine nuts). The food took quite a while to come out, and the pasta was presented beautifully, however, the taste unfortunately fell flat. My pasta felt kind of bland and there wasn't much flavor there. \n\nMy mom ordered the mafaldine which had a nice light lemon-y flavor which she really enjoyed and i tried a little and I actually quite liked that pasta over the one I had ordered.

You really don't have ONE favorite that stood out? It was honestly off putting, subtract -1 star for that. \n\nOkay.. back to the food. The appetizers and entrees were delicious. They have different menus for lunch and dinner. The appetizers we ordered arancini, tuscan duck liver mousse, and chicken polpettine. There were 5 of us so they were kind enough to have 5 of each for most of the appetizers for us. The arancini was delicious - everyone must try that. The duck liver was something I could pass - it had a sour taste to it. The chicken polpettine was amazing!!! Was so savory and you got to dip it in tomato sauce. \n\nMoving on to the main dish, I got the tagliatelle. It was savory, noodle was slurpy, and had the right amount of cheese on top. I honestly haven't had good pasta in a while!! \n\nAt the end, we brought a cake, had it brought out, and they sliced it for us, which was kind of them.

The chicken meatballs and the squid dish. They were both really delicious and well made. I don't see a lot of chicken meatballs in the menu in restaurants so it's cool to see it; the meatballs were light and it came with a fresh sweet and tangy marinara sauce.

Definitely recommend planning to arrive early or plan to wait because I've seen their lines go long!\n\nAs first timers, we went in on some cocktails and got the following:\n- Bucatini (2 Orders)\n- Strawberries, Pickled Shallots, Wild arugula, Pistachio, Ricotta Salata \n- Shishito Peppers & Squid\n- Margherita Pizza\n\nOverall, a solid meal, with everything feeling rustic, fresh and tasty. I like the fact that they really let the ingredients shine in the dishes. But if I were to identify a star, it would be the BUCATINI (5 Star dish). We only ordered two orders for the table to share, but I could have easily finished one order all by myself. I'm such the noodle lover and I appreciated the perfect al dente texture and there's something about this dish that epitomized comfort food, where you just feel that love...in your stomach :-). I definitely will come back, as this has been my identified bucatini spot. Thanks!", "author": "Vincent L."}

If you are looking for good mid range Italian in Hayes Valley look no further. \n\nApps and starters are in the $10-14 range, while pastas (which I feel are the most stand out/ inventive portion of the menu) average about $16.

A paccheri dish (that is, a type of pasta somewhat similiar to, but wider than, rigatoni) was nicely portioned at $15, but not overly so is as so often the case at Italian-oriented restaurants. A mixture of sauce and shredded cheese provided a  perfect, not-overwhelming backdrop to all this.\n\nI couldn't resist dessert, and the chocolate budino with crema and espresso sea salt was a fitting finish to an absolutely satisfying meal.

They're always insanely busy for dinner so service isn't always the fastest or most attentive, but the food is so good so I don't mind. You just have to reset your expectations and understand that they're crazy busy.

Actually the orange sauce made it look like I was eating candy corn and kind of grossed me out. Just didn't think the mixture of flavors was that great. The chicken meatballs were quite dense- not very juicy as I was hoping.  The bucatini pasta was solid- no complaints, al dente. And the malfadine was just OK as well. The panna cotta was pretty decent! Good firm texture, although persimmons could have been a bit more ripe. Service was just alright as well.

It's clearly the highlight pasta of the place!! At first, I was skeptical. What could possibly make a pancetta + spaghetti + tomato-based sauce be soooo good? But alas....

We ordered the Fontina Arancini ($11), the Margherita Pizza ($12), and the Bucatini all' amatriciana ($15). \n\nThe Fontina Arancini was good, crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. It reminded me of a scaled up version of fried mozzarella ball with some better cheese and the addition of some rice. \n\nThe Margherita Pizza was brought to our table fresh and hot. Although the texture was good, the amount of toppings was pretty lacking. There were probably 3 or 4 small basil leaves in the middle of the pizza, and a limited amount of mozzarella and tomato sauce. Overall it was average only because of the lack of toppings.\n\nThe Bucatini all' amatriciana was delicious, their popular homemade pasta definitely lived up to expectations.

The. I got a text about 45 minutes in saying my table was ready. I checked in with the hostess and she apologized saying the table was not actually ready. 20 minutes later, they lead us to a table meant for 2 people which clearly would not hold all of the dishes needed for three people. When we pointed that out, it took another 10 minutes for them to figure out another seating arrangement for us. It was frustrating that we had to wait 30 minutes after receiving a text saying the table was ready. \nOnce we were seated, the waitress came over but she seemed unprepared to tell us what the restaurant was out of. She mentioned that there was just one more serving of the tagliateli left, which we tried to order, but after checking again she said it wasn't available anymore. Then we placed our order and our waitress came out 10 minutes later to say they were out of the appetizer we ordered. I understand this happens but it would have been nice if she could have gotten a better handle on what was actually available so we wouldn't keep being disappointed. For the main course, we had three of the pastas. The only one that was worthwhile was the bucatini. The spaghettini tastes overwhelmingly fishy and the rigatoni was very bland.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-21", "description": "I like this place a lot and have been here a fair number of times. I'm in love with the focaccia, I could eat it for days. The pizza is a nice, solid Italian-style pie and seems very gently worked. I think their pasta and pizza doughs could use a touch more salt, and that the pasta could be cooked around 30-60 seconds less (the two times I've tried it, it hasn't been al-dente... it could also be that it needs some more dry time). There's a huge focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients here and they're in the habit of showcasing a number of things that look and taste positively beautifully in-season. This is a really great go-to, but sometimes it's missing a bit of seasoning and balance (e.g., the pesto pasta needed some lemon juice and maybe something else); that said, even when the food isn't amazing it's always made better by the intense flavors of their high-quality ingredients.\n\nIn short: good food, reasonable price point. Great little restaurant in an easily-walkable area for dates or dinner with friends or coworkers. Try the focaccia, the pizza, and specials like the fried chicken (which looked phenomenal and several of the people I was with described it as the best chicken they'd ever had). It's important to note that they do not take reservations, you have to physically go there and put your name down. I can understand not taking reservations, especially given the neighborhood and how packed they typically are, but they also won't do takeout.", "author": "Aly P."}

Maybe it was the red wine that convinced me to indulge. \n\nMy boss raved about a Mano. She said it's her favorite and I must pay a visit to anything that's anyone's favorite so I can judge for myself. \n\nCame here right when they opened for dinner time on a Saturday. They were already so packed but luckily there was one table outside available.\n\nI ordered the  bucatini, arancini, and the salad that had sardines in it that emulated a caesar but less rich of a dressing.\n\nLet me caveat and say that I'm giving this establishment 4 stars due to the fact that they do not skimp on the cheese! Forget the sprinkling or a dash of shaved parm, this place gives you heaping hurricanes of cheese atop your pasta and salad. It was so glorious!\n\nThe bucatini noodles were a bit harder than al dente. The sauce was kind of salty for my liking. The arancini balls (fried cheese balls) in a cheese sauce were cold, and the salad was my favorite (next to the wine). The salad was tart but meshed well with the mounds of parm. \n\nI really like a Mano for its lack of a hoity toity attitude. Hip hip horray!

I've tried to come here for dinner on several occasions, only to be told that there would be a 2 hour wait. The trick is to come here early - between 5-5:45 PM, there is virtually zero wait, and you even get a choice of sitting inside or out! I'd recommend sitting outside if it's not too windy, as it's so nice to people watch, and they have pretty strong heat lamps that keep you nice and cozy.\n\nThere's a few menu staples along with seasonal dishes, so I'm excited to continue coming back when the menu changes! 1-2 appetizers + 1 entree is usually enough for 2 people. I love the cauliflower and fried asparagus, which was a seasonal dish. The cauliflower is zesty and a little spicy, and the asparagus is very lightly battered, so you don't feel greased up before your meal starts. The arancini balls were quite good and should be tried at least once, but a bit heavy especially given the carb-heavy remainder of the meal.\n\nI've only ever tried the pastas, because I didn't think the pizza selections were anything unique that you couldn't find at Delfina, Del Popolo, etc. Definitely try the new buckwheat rigatoni with cremini mushrooms and garlic.

My friends and I were really pleased with the quality of the food (you can taste how fresh the pasta is!) for its price! Such a cute Italian spot and I would recommend to everyone to try if you're in Hayes Valley. \n\nWhat we ordered: \n:: fontina arancini . This was a lighter appetizer to start with. I think I enjoyed the pumpkin sauce more than the rice/cheese balls itself but I liked how it wasn't heavy for something that's fried. (4/5)\n\n::pizza- funghi and salsiccia . I think I enjoyed the salsiccia pizza better than the funghi one even though I love anything with mushrooms in it. I wasn't too crazy about the pizza compared to the other entr\u00e9es. I think it's because I like my pizza packed with toppings and I was kind of disappointed at how little meat there were on the salsiccia. I do love the thin crust though! (3.5/5)\n\n::pasta mafaldine and bucatini. I loved both of these pasta dishes and they're so different from the each other. The mafaldine ( I believe this is a seasonal dish) was so light and fresh from the pesto and the butternut squash. My friends and I loved the pesto so much (we tried to ask the waiter to ask the chef for the recipe but he never got back to us , so sad). The bucatini on the other hand is more savory compared to the mafaldine but I like how light the dish was even though it was supposed to be the heavier one of the two.  (4.5/5)\n\n::special of the day : fried chicken - my true love.  I believe the chicken is only served on Wednesday and we were lucky ! The thighs were boneless so it made splitting the dish easy and the flavoring was spot on. I wasn't a fan of the kale though.  (4/5)\n\nOverall, we had a great experience in terms of ambiance and service! The bill ended being only $26 each for 5 people for 5 entrees and an appetizer + coffee for all.

I was expecting bread and olive oil for the table like most Italian restaurants, but they didn't offer it, which was disappointing since that is definitely part of the Italian dinner experience. We decided to order the chicken meatballs, the filled gnocchi dish, and the braised duck pasta. The chicken meatballs were good, but I have never been a big fan of meatballs so I didn't really care for them. The pasta, however, was very good but the portions were extremely small. The braised duck had so much flavor and the curly pasta was a little out of the ordinary. The filled pastas were somewhat sweet from the squash, and the pasta was super sauce. \n\nOverall, I would come again to this place if I was really craving good pasta.

(Why oh why don't I live in the city?) After seeing all the beautiful photos of delicious pastas and pizzas, I was convinced this was going to be a good match. Is it Julie + a Mano forever?? If they keep up with this level of cooking and flavor, it may just be destiny. \n\na Mano is located on Hayes Street in the Hayes Valley area of San Francisco. I don't frequent this area, but I think I should now. The space is on a street full of cute shops and other restaurants. It's just two shops down from the newly-opened Salt & Straw which is super convenient for those who want some good apr\u00e8s dinner artisanal ice cream. There's plenty of street parking all around the area. \n\na Mano is offering some delicious homemade pastas, pizzas, and small plates from their colorful hipster-ish space. Their menu is simple and they also have an additional \"Specials of the Day\" menu which hangs on their interior wall. I love that their prices don't break the bank so that many other people can go enjoy their dishes. Having delicious well-made food and making it affordable is something more chefs and restauranteurs should think about. Our server was very helpful and attentive. He came by often to check on us and to ask how our food was. He was knowledgeable about each dish on the menu also. \n\nThe only con I can think of is that they don't take reservations. Why? It's especially uncomfortable when it's a really windy day in the city and you're trying your hardest not to get sick while waiting in line to get in. We lined up outside the door before they opened at 5pm.....with about 15 people ahead of us. Thank God the restaurant is big and can fit about 80 people. So just remember that it's first come first serve. \n\nTagliatelle : I really wanted to try their Tagliatelle with Pesto and pine nuts which they used to have just the month before, but I guess they ran out of Pesto? This was good just as well. It was creamy and the pasta was perfectly al dente also. I would definitely order this again! \n\nPorchetta : This is their Special of the Day. (Saturday) I've never had it as an entr\u00e9e, only in a sandwich, so of course I had to order it. I was blown away by how thick a slab of Porchetta it was! That piece of pig was HUGE. I feel that it could've feed 4 people. Even the man and woman next to us was pleasantly shocked and they in turn ordered this Special right away. For an exceptional dish like this to have a price tag of just $20 is unheard of in the city. We couldn't finish it at all so we boxed the rest up to make Porchetta sandwiches the next day. The only negative thing I can think of is that it was a bit dry after a couple of bites. I wished there was more salsa verde on the dish.", "author": "Julie W."}

After thirty mins, we got called that our table was ready and got seated inside. The interior is super cute and open, so it doesn't feel tight in there. Me and my friend ordered three items all to share. We got the aracini appetizer, margherita pizza, and lastly the bucatini pasta. The aracini was something I've never had before, it was a fried stuffed risotto and cheese ball served on a mini cast iron skillet. The pizza was alright, it was a little dry and it would've been better if it had more cheese. The good part was that the crust was crispy and non oily. Lastly the pasta, I was expecting more from the pasta portion wise because it literally probably had two long strands of spaghetti only and the dish was gone. However, I thought it was a little too much cheese flavor which overpowered the flavors of the pancetta and the sauce. a Mano is something you have to try if you like pasta/pizzas, but this wouldn't be a favorite spot for me.", "author": "Lisa W."}

Thanks to climate change, San Francisco can actually be an appealing outdoor destination and it's difficult to walk by a Mano without succumbing to that temptation.  \n\nThe outdoor seating at a Mano is arranged in a smart way, maximizing the space and ensuring that passers-by see not just the diners but also, in many cases, the food and drink they're enjoying.  It pretty much dares you to just walk on by, for who doesn't like good Italian fare?  \n\nWith a \"no reservation\" policy, a Mano can be an equal opportunity offender but on the evening I dined there, outdoors naturally, a table was snagged almost immediately.  Service took a bit longer and was actually my only beef with the a Mano experience.  Throughout my meal it was difficult to get or sustain the attention of my server; we weren't asking a lot but did have some questions, some needs for our table, and the requirement that we be on time for a nearby show at SFJazz.  \n\nSo, some small beefs about service but zero beefs about the food: this would adequately sum up my a Mano experience.  \n\nTheres nothing ground breaking going on here but the prices - by SF standards - are reasonable and the food is good.  Shared Arugula Salad, Bucatini, Margarita Pizza, and Chicken Meatballs (which I'd have preferred not to share; they're quite good) made for a quality and filling meal with each plate coming in anywhere from about $13 - $18.  The food reminded me of that at Delfina, and that is said as a compliment.  \n\nIn this immediate area there's a lot of places I like, all vying for my dining dollars.  A Mano  didn't do anything to cause me to recommend them over some other very good options nor did they dissuade me.  If you're in the area without restaurant reservations it'd be worth your time to see if they could take you.

The large windows facing Hayes bring in tons of light and energy. No reservations, so plan to wait anywhere from 40mins-1 hour, esp during Friday dinner service. They've got any efficient notification process; give your number and you'll get a text once your table is ready. \n\nThe FOOD! They've got some excellent variety of dishes here. We started off with the grilled squid appetizer. It was mediocre. Though nicely grilled, the butter beans and tomato sauce did little to add more flavor. For my main I had, I believe a seasonal dish, chicken and pork ravioli which was just nice. I was expecting more flavor, but overall there was solid flavor. My friend had the tagliatelle al ragu, and that was bomb! Full of tomato sauce flavor, the beef soft and juicy and it was perfect.

And every time we walk by, there's a line, especially on the weekends and for dinner. Came about 5:30 on a weekday. And still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which I consider not bad. It was outside on the sidewalk though. Luckily it wasn't too cold and they do also have heaters. Service was pretty slow. Sure they were busy. And it probably had something to do with us sitting outside too. But yeah it took a while to get our order (food and drinks separately) taken. Food was brought out quickly (though this is due to the kitchen and another bus boy/expediter/waiter). But then to try and get our check took another 15 min or so after we were done. Also I ordered a house made soda that had passion fruit in it. Now I love passion fruit everything so I had to get it. It came out red from another bus boy/expediter/waiter and I was slightly confused. But sipped it anyways - it was fine, but I didn't taste any passion fruiot. Waiter strolls by 5 minutes later and was like oh did you notice it's a cranberry soda now. They just ran out of the passion fruit one. \"I hope that's ok\" I remember a rushed apology. But what the heck? You could've told me before you brought out the substitute that you didn't have what I originally ordered. I don't think I wouldn't gotten it if it wasn't passion fruit. But since I already had taken a few sips, I just kept it. Ugh, that's slightly sneaky of them. \nAs for the food, I got the torchetti with lamb and broccoli and the agnolotti with chicken and pork. There's a lot of options and it all looked really good and I wanted to try everything. But I think we were happy with what we got. I liked my dish. Torchetti is like a rolled pasta, lamb was tender and not enough broccoli for me, but it was fine. The agnolotti a stuffed pasta, similar to ravioli. It was a chicken and pork mixture inside that was fine. Both dishes could've used more sauce. But the pasta is on point. The waiter made a point of stating that a mano mean by hand so all their pasta is home made. And you can taste it. Portions are really small and the waiter did tell us that when we ordered - it's small plates and meant to be shared and you should get a few dishes to try. But it's also pretty pricy, almost $20 a dish. So we really didn't want to get any more dishes. (And we just ended up getting ice cream down the street for dessert). \nI would try this place again but maybe try to sit on the inside and be up front with my choices. Pasta is good but service brought the rating down.", "author": "Alison W."}

I wasn't a fan of sitting RIGHT next to a giant pillar (what's up with that?) but I guess that keeps my focus on Nina and our conversation. We ordered a bunch of items that were quite tasty. Nina liked the duck liver mousse, and I was more a fan of the squid starter. The squid has corn, romanesco, and shishito peppers. Beautiful and flavorful dish!\n\nI loved my entree even more.

Squid smelled amazing and had good texture, not over-cooked. Corn was very sweet, in a good way since corn is in season.\n-Pizza- With summer squash, zucchini blossoms, stracciatella, Vidalia onion, lemon. Tasted light, fresh, and the crust was very good. Chili flakes given were spicy, which I liked.\n-Spaghettini- With clams, chili, lemon, pangratatto. Served steaming hot! I was told that pasta should not be served steaming hot, but this turned out fine because the pasta was still al dente when we ate it. Clams were flavorful and the sauce/broth was tasty.\n-Wallbanger- Cocktail made with vodka, mango, pineapple, mint, Galliano. Dangerously tasty, taste like juice but I was red-faced and tipsy shortly.\n-Negroni- Made with Gin, Campari, Carpano Antica. Solid.\n \nSERVICE\nGood as waitress was friendly and other staff who helped with the food/water were timely. Our order was taken correctly and food came out at a good leisurely pace. Since we sat at the communal table, the waitress took care of all patrons at the table. The group of four older guests next to us received the most attention while we received adequate \"normal\" amount of attention. The couple who got seated on our other side received an introduction/explanation of the restaurant/menu when they sat down- \"all pastas are house-made, as well as our sausage\". We did not get that introduction even though we were also asked if it was our first time dining there and we answered \"yes\". NOT an issue for me, but just something I noticed.\n \nAMBIENCE/D\u00c9COR\nBright and lively. Noise level can be a bit loud inside. Tables inside and outside. Table top of communal table inside is lime green color, which worked very well in photos! Nice wall shelf of alcohol at the bar with several bartenders and multiple seatings available outside which is a good option for summer evenings.\n \nYes, I would come back again because food is solid, drinks are great, and I want to try other items on the menu.

Having grown up outside NYC and being half raised on Italian food, I admit I do have expectations of handmade pasta so when a Mano said that was their focus, I expected something great.\n\nArrived Saturday 10 minutes before they opened and ended up being second in line; by the time 5pm rolled around, there was a line long enough to fill about half the restaurant when let in. \n\nFOOD:\ntuscan duck liver mousse, strawberry mostarda (5/5): This was actually really yummy! The liver mousse had just the right amount of funkiness as expected and the sweetness of the strawberry really balanced it out to created a light and refreshing appetizer. I would definitely get this again!\n\ntagliatelle (2/5): Seems like a lot of reviews spoke highly of this dish but I found this one extremely underwhelming. The pasta actually had very little bite and crumbled quickly with each bite. The pesto was also quite underseasoned which resulted in a relatively bland dish and pasta that really doesn't meet expectations for a pasta that is handmade.\n\nagnolotti dal plin (3/5): Very small portion size but what came was decently tasty. The agnolotti had some good bite and the filling was flavorful. The sauce it came with contained a little bit of chard but did a decent job of pulling the dish together. Overall tasty but nothing great.\n\nbucatini all' amatriciana (3.5/5): Probably the best pasta out of the 3 we tasted. This one actually tasted up to par for something that was handmade pasta with good bite and chew. Unlike the tagliatelle, this dish was actually really salty and the bit of spice only served to accentuate the saltiness more. If this one was seasoned less, it'd stand out more as a decent dish.\n\nService was good but that's nothing surprising for a hot and new restaurant.

Another time I've ordered pizza as well as another red sauced pasta that was super delicious though, but somehow I can't remember their names.\n\nEven though there seems to always be a wait any day of the week, what's nice is that there are shops to browse in the area while you wait.

Baume in Palo Alto feels that way.  The surrounding area is full of concrete fast casual places and small stores you go to if you need stationary or need to ship something.  But once you enter Baume, you are in an incredibly modern fine dining establishment that sets the tone for the exquisite food that follows.\n\nThat is not the case with a Mano.  It feels like it would have to be in Hayes Valley.  Floor to ceiling windows that let out a lot of light (and can even let in nature) allow the bustling and open restaurant to match perfectly with the energetic streets where residents and visitors alike check out the variety of unique boutique stores in this neighborhood.\n\na Mano serves Italian food.  Their housemade pastas are a real draw.  Not just because the pasta is fresh and bouncy, which it is, but due to their showcase of seasonal ingredients.  These seasonal ingredients allow the chefs to create unique preparations as well as feature delicious ingredients and flavors at peak quality.\n\nI had their chestnut campanelle pasta, which was nicely thick.  They garnished the pasta with roasted chestnuts, which provided a nutty flavor but with a softer and chewier center than the typical crunch you would get from a nut.  There was also celery root crema, which provided some creaminess without being too rich as well as Brussels sprouts leaves, which were lightly bitter and helped the dish avoid being heavy.\n\nFor dessert, I had the buttermilk panna cotta with persimmons.  Like the chestnuts, persimmons are only around for certain times of year, and I loved the sweet flavor and juiciness, which was a nice contrast to the sour buttermilk flavor.  The panna cotta was well prepared as it had the perfect amount of wobbliness.\n\nService was friendly and quick.\n\nPrices are not cheap, but given the quality, I think it is well worth the few extra dollars per dish you might pay at a Mano over other lower quality Italian restaurants in the Bay Area.\n\na Mano is a very good Italian restaurant.  Their seasonal menu excites me because it makes it the kind of restaurant you can go back to again and again knowing that you are going to have a different experience while also knowing the chefs behind the kitchen will maintain high standards for preparation, presentation and quality of ingredients.\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is around a Mano.  I would imagine parking options are limited.", "author": "Anthony N."}

Bang for your buck 4/5.\n\nThe wait for this place on a Saturday night for a party of six was a three hour wait. That's right a three hour wait. I already planned my birthday dinner here so we decided to get some snacks around Hayes Valley to wait for the ridiculous wait time. \n\nAs one of the restaurants under the Beretta group, I had high expectations for flavorful Italian dishes made with care. The dishes were mixed with some dishes really good while others not as great. The atmosphere was absolutely great with lightly dim lights, and tables inside and out with communal tables just like Beretta. \n\nRecommendations:\n\nRoasted cauliflower : This dish was delicious with crispy roasted cauliflower with hints of lemon and chili. \n\nFried summer beans: This dish was perfectly fried with a breading that wasn't too oily. The beans still had a nice crunch to them and the aioli kept the dish interesting. \n\ntagliatelle, pesto, english peas, fava pinenuts: This dish was as delicious as it looked with the pesto being fresh and herby. The pasta was thin and perfectly al dente. The roasted pine nuts gave the dish a warm and nutty flavor. \n\ncampanelle, brocolli di ciccio, garlic, chili, nicoise olives: This was probably my second favorite pasta dish with the overall conscious of the dish being light and fresh, but more herbaceous than the pesto. I was worried that the dish was going to lack flavor but it was far from it. \n\nCould be better: \n\nfontina arancini: The rice balls were bland and not all of them were equally filled with cheese inside. The sauce on the bottom was stone cold and tasted like store bought vodka sauce. \n\nbucatini all' amatriciana, tomato, pancetta, pecorino: This dish felt watered down, with a lacking of flavor and richness. The pork was a great addition but didn't meld well with the pasta. \n\nTortellini: This dish was a little sweet for my taste with the cheese and corn. The broth didn't really add any flavors. \n\nButtermilk panna cotta: It tasted like vanilla noosa yogurt with strawberries. I wasn't too impressed with this. \n\nBiscotti and Nutella sundae: It was meh, with the Nutella and ice cream being just mediocre and the one dimensional biscotti gave no depth to the dish. \n\nIn addition, the service could have been better. Some of the staff members were excellent and gave great attention to details like folding the napkin on the table when a person left. On the other hand, our waiter felt distant and didn't really give us too much attention. In addition the hostess was cold and it felt like she didn't think we were good enough to eat here.\n\nI think that a Mona still needs time to refine their dishes but overall it's still a good restaurant to go too. I just wouldn't want to wait three hours for it. I'll probably come back to try a Mona in a couple of months to see if it's better. \n\nTips - Come early to get your name of the list and walk around Hayes Valley to wait. Anina the cocktail bar is right next to it and it's a great palace to wait. They also currently don't take reservations.", "author": "Brian N."}

There was a line just to check in but luckily they were able to seat us right away. We were a party of two.\n\nWe were greeted right away and got water. Our server Juliette made some great recommendations and we were set. I told her I don't drink and she was really accommodating and told me what cocktails they could make virgin. I had the Wallbanger and it was great. The cocktail is $12 but the virgin is only $5. I appreciate the fair pricing. Some places would only knock off a buck or two when you ask for no alcohol in a cocktail. \n\nWe had the squid, agnolotti, tagliatelle, porchetta and ended with the panna cotta. Everything was great especially the squid and agnolotti.\n\nStreet parking wasn't bad when we went at 10p but during the day would be much harder. \n\nOverall a great joint for fresh made pasta.

We sat outside, watching city life unfold in front of us. There were cars, dogs, delivery boys, men and women of all ages and children of all stripes sharing the sun-kissed street on this radiant spring day. As such, we were in good spirits and a sharing mood. \n\nWe split the asparagus, pancetta, green garlic and pecorino pizza with arugula. This was only our second choice, after the closed-minded chef curiously wouldn't allow us to add pancetta to the margherita. Still, it was dangerously good and disappeared from our plates in the blink of an eye. We also shared two pastas: the trochetti, kale pesto, young carrots and pine nuts, as well as the tagliatelle alla bolognese with an olive oil fried egg. Both were exceptionally plated, though slightly less noteworthy in taste. The kale pesto added some bitterness that, in my view, was uncalled for. As a final note, I got a homemade \"soda\" of various fruits that was tranquil and refreshing. Overall, a solid (if not exceptional) lunch.", "author": "Oliver S."}

My colleague and I hadn't yet had our team holiday lunch, and a Mano was his suggestion. I originally imagined it to be a dimly lit, classically Italian-in-every-way restaurant, but to my surprise, it was bright and airy with an open floor concept. The menu is simple, but there are so many good things to choose from. We ordered (with ratings on a 5 star scale):\n\n- 5/5 Salad: gem lettuce, fennel, radish, anchovy, ricotta salata, capers - The mix of flavors complemented each other perfectly. I love anchovy. If you aren't a big fan of it, you can still get this, because the anchovy is not mixed in. \n\n- 5/5 Salad: wild arugula, beets, gorgonzola, hazelnut, pickled shallot\n\n- 4/5 Pasta: orecchiette, clams, broccoli, garlic, chili, pangrattato -\nThe pasta was so well made, there was a certain chewiness to it that you can't replicate through store bought pasta shells. I'm also a huge fan of putting chili on pasta, and the spice in this dish was PERFECT. My only thing is that I'm big on creamy pastas. The orecchiette had more of a soupy base, but nonetheless was super yummy!\n\n- 10/5 Dessert: Chocolate budino - \nYes, you heard that right. The chocolate budino got a 10 out of 5 stars. So what. It was THAT GOOD. I never have the stomach for desserts after a meal, but the servings here weren't super huge so I had room. The chocolate budino was a rich, dark chocolate pot de creme with mascarpone cheese and a sprinkle of salt on top. Washed down with a Mano's cappuccino, you are in for a TREAT. I would go back here just for this!\n\n- 5/5 Dessert: Apple pie -\nMy colleague got an apple pie with mascarpone cheese on top. I'm not a huge fan of pie, but from what I tried, this was on point too.\n\nYelpers beware - they do not take reservations (walk-ins only) and the tables are very close together. I felt at one point we were all listening in on each others' (interesting) conversations. This place is not good for groups. (Which is why I took off one star) Otherwise, the food is solid!

FYI, they're owned by the same ppl as Beretta (and I personally love that spot). Despite the naysayers of long, long lines and spotty service, my friend and I (she's also pescetarian!) decided to give this spot a try. \n\nFirst things first, we were seriously prepared to wait. ALL the reviews screamed LONG LINES. BE WARNED. We came here right after work, around 5:50pm(?), and it was about 3/4 empty. What the what??? Did we go to the wrong place? No. Are ppl still out of town from the July 4th wkend? Maybe. Is it better to go before 6pm? Hell, yes. Within 20mins of our arrival, the entire spot was jam packed! \n\nWe both ordered the gin grapefruit bitters situation and it came out straight up. Whoa, it's a Wednesday and I wasn't prepared for that, but it was tasty af. And not too strong (def a creeper). We started with the squid app (perfectly grilled, but nothing EXTRAordinary about it). For the main dishes, we got the clam spaghetti and the pesto tagliatelle. The clam spaghetti came out right away, and it was a good thing we were sharing bc the messed up our order and gave us a second meat pasta dish. We looked confused. They looked confused. Four other tables around us got that correct dish we were waiting on before us...even though we were there well before they were. Fine, you're a new spot getting your bearings, but no apologies or explanation so idk if it was the waiter, server or what, who made the mistake. \n\nAnywho, a Mano means by hand. They've got guys churning out hand made pasta from their open kitchen, which is great. The pasta was al dente (when it finally arrived), and the \"sauces\" (not really a sauce, nor should it be) was perfectly light and complimentary to the hand made pastas. Just like when I was in Italy! Extra points for that. \n\nAll in all, good food and good drinks. Service could be a bit better, but I'd def come back. 4 stars!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

It all comes from that amazing aoili that they use to dip those veggies ... damn!! It was Delish! \n\nAs always, I normally go for \"Clams spaghetti\" - A Mano has not disappointed me.

Both were incredibly salty. The seafood pasta was particularly fishy which wasn't to my taste (but I guess that might be what you would expect when buying a seafood pasta dish?). Regardless - salt overload. The price of each pasta dish was between $15 and $18 and we really felt like we didn't get anything special for that premium price.\n\nWe both agree that we will never return here for dinner, but may appear for happy hour as we did truly enjoy the cocktails and appetizers.\n\nI should also note that there is potential to get great seats here with cool ambiance within the main dining area or next to a window.

I might be bias because I'm in love with one dish, \"BUCATINI ALL' AMATRICIANA\"!! Honestly my favorite pasta dish ever. It's $14 and made with tomato, pancetta and pecorino. I came here 3 times in 2 weeks and I don't even live in the area. And I got the same pasta all 3 times. My only complaint is the portion size for this pasta dish is smaller than the others. Everything on the menu was also delicious. My breakdown is below.  \n\nDrinks: \n*Rossini - Bubbles, Elderflower, Strawberry.....10 (my favorite) Wine mixed cocktail. It's dangerously delicious! \n*Wallbanger - Vodka, Mango, Mint, Galliano.....12 - Little too sweet for my taste but still\nrefreshing. \n\nPasta: \nBucatini all' amatriciana, tomato, pancetta, pecorino 14 - The BEST! The pasta has the perfect chewiest. The sauce is amazing. Slightly tart and savory. The pancetta just completes the dish with a bang! \nRigatoni with pork sugo 14 - flat tube pasta and tasty. It's the favorite said the waitress. I like it but I think the sauce is a bit on the watery side. \n\nAntipasti: \n*Monterey squid, summer corn, romanesco, olives 13 - hot dish, perfectly cooked squid. The sweetest of the corn makes it the perfect summer dish. Very light and tasty. \n*Fontina arancini 11 - I do like this but not my favorite. Fried with risotto on the inside. \n*Cauliflower, lemon, chili, bagna cauda 8 - Love this dish, so good. The best cauliflower I had. I'm sure it's the chili that makes this dish amazing, found a new way to cook cauliflower now. \n*Fritto misto (not on their standard everyday menu) - Fried seafood and veggies. The batter was light and wasn't overly fried. I ate more than I would normally for fried food, which is a good sign. Haha\n\nPizza \n*Salsiccia, chili sausage, tomato, provolone picante, olives, red onion 15 - pizza was good, thin crust and you can add all the toppings you want. \n\nMeat: \n*Pancetta - Served with a side small salad.

It wasn't really what I'd consider authentic Italian and thus minus one star. But portion size is decent and very reasonably priced. We tried:\n\nFocaccia with Olive Tapenade: Fantastic Focaccia bread, super flavorful, just the right crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Tapenade was great as well!\n\nTorchetti with Braised Lamb Shoulder, Broccoli Rabe, Capers and Caprino: I loved the pasta made in house and it was cooked perfectly. But the lamb, while didn't taste gamey, was a bit overpowering. The broccoli rabe also tasted a bit bitter. My half Italian boyfriend jokes that he's never had lamb in a pasta dish because that's just not what they do.\n\n\nMargherita Pizza: Because this is the only kind of pizza my purist half Italian boyfriend orders. You can definitely tell that the pizza wasn't cooked in a wood fired oven, and it wasn't, which is not a big deal. But the dough was a bit too hard and chewy for my preference, and it was actually overly crunchy on the outside. The tomato sauce wasn't as flavorful as I'd like as well. But for $12, I'd say it was a not too bad pizza for one.\n\nOverall a great spot for a chill/low key dinner in Hayes Valley, but actually feel like you are sorta kinda having a night out without all that hassle.

Hayes Valley is in desperate need of a yummy Italian spot. Had dinner here during its soft opening for a first date with the hottest man I've ever seen in my life. I knew this restaurant would be a hit! My suspicions were correct as I see lines out the door here every night! Its become a total hotspot, especially with Anina next door as well. Never saw my date again but I will for sure be back for the food. \n\nThey don't take reservations which might explain the constant line and wait times. I feel like this place is going to put ll Borgo and Delle Stelle out of business. The cocktails here are amazing and super dangerous. I left here pretty drunk despite stuffing myself silly with yummy carb loaded Italian food. I had the pizza, pasta, and asparagus appetizer. Also had some dessert but couldn't even finish it. I usually do not eat pasta but theirs was delicious. I happily ate my leftovers the next day. \n\nPrices are on par with all the other restaurants, make sure you add the egg to the pizza. They put the entire egg on just one slice which was kind of weird when its usually in the middle but whatever. I went there a while ago and forgot to finish writing this review so I forgot most of the details. Our waiter Brian was such a pro! Entire staff here is awesome. This place is straight up bumping.

I finally did and this place blew me away. The restaurant actually listens! The food was so much better and had less salt. My biggest issue last time was the lack of toppings. For example my Margherita pizza was tiny and only had one basil leaf on it. It would have been topless if I had not ordered an egg on top. This time the fungi pizza was bigger and came with normal amounts of toppings.", "author": "Diane Z."}

While it was super crowded the day I went (they don't take reservations), I heard it was because of an event happening in the city that night and the wait is usually 30 min - 1 hour, not the 2.5 hours that I waited. My 2nd visit, I opted for 8:30pm on a Sunday to avoid any semblance of the usual crowd; we were seated immediately. \n\nThe menu rotates often so it's definitely worth a few repeat visits. The entrees range from $12-16 which in the heart of Hayes Valley, sounds like a steal for a sit down dinner. My ratings are for pasta only; there are other things like thin crust pizza on the menu. \n\nRigatoni with pork sugo (summer 2017 visit) 3.5/5 - not my favorite, pork flavor fell a bit flat, nothing special, but I love the rigatoni texture.\n\nBucatini all amatriciana (Jan 2018 visit) 3/5 - a bit too tomato-y without enough pancetta. Sauce appeared to pretty much be tomato paste, not my favorite.\n\nAgnolotti dal plin (both visits) 4/5 - white parmesan cream sauce over mini ravioli stuffed full with chicken and pork. The cream overpowers the meat flavor compared to a lot of the other dishes.  \n\nTagliatelle alla bolognese (Jan 2018 visit) 4.5/5 - I'm a sucker for traditional beef bolognese sauce, the tagliatelle was thin but cooked al dente so it was perfect. If you're looking for something traditional, this hits the spot, but if you're being adventurous, look towards something else.\n\nMafaldine (Jan 2018 visit) 4.5/5 - Really unique protein option for pasta, but did very well with the light clear sauce and chard. Super chewy squiggly pasta (like the rippled edges of lasagna noodles)\n\nI would opt for family style sharing with maybe 1 1/2 plates per person; the portions are a bit small to feed a single person, but great for sharing.

I wanted to check a Mano out because the food looked really good and I loved reading about how they planned out their menu, making everything so fresh. We were seated near the open kitchen and we got to watch fresh pasta being made. \n\nIt's tight quarters in here, but don't let that discourage you. The service was top notch and we were well attended to in such a packed and bustling place. We were so hungry that we ordered 4 appetizers, three pastas and the special osso bucco for dinner. Food came out at a good pace and we finished every last bite. My favorite appetizer was the fritto misto with shrimp and calamari, as well as the duck liver. I love that our server offered to get extra crostini when he saw I was finishing them with still a bit of liver to go. The chicken polpetti were good, as was the asparagus with prosciutto. \n\nI was hoping the special tonight was the porchetta, but the osso bucco was absolutely delicious. It came with polenta that was good, but a little salty. However, the pastas were the star of dinner. We had the tagliatelle, agnolotti dal plin and bucatini.  Each were cooked perfectly and the sauces were excellent, especially the pesto. I secretly wanted the bucatini all to myself, but will have to wait for another visit. \n\nIt seems funny that I don't have a lot of go-to pasta places in the back of my pocket, but a Mano is definitely going to be one for me.

Even on a Friday night, we only waited about 20 minutes to get a spot. Luckily I had followed up with the front because they seated us immediately after I had waited 20 minutes but did not notify me on my phone. I am wondering if they're still working out on that system, but I highly recommend coming in earlier than usual for dinner if you do not want to wait in the long liens. \n\nFOOD: For the antipasti, we went with the cauliflower with the bagna cauda. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection and the bagna cauda was delicious with the right amount of garlic in the sauce. For the pasta, I got the mostaccioli with the tripe and I must say, the pasta was perfectly made by hand. The right amount of al dente and the tripe was cooked to perfection, this whole pasta dish came together quite well.

You?\"\n\nA: Gurl, me too! Well, except the Lifetime movies part. I'm usually in bed my 9 pm!\"\nMe: \"OMG - ME TOO!\"\n\nAhhh, what a change from 5 years ago when we would have answered, \"I don't know...I blacked out after the 10th shot and went home with David, or was it Chris?\" Hi, dad! Just kidding...\n\nThese days, instead of spending $$$ at the bar and losing all my morals, I rather spend that money on a nice meal catching up with friends. Except a \"nice\" dinner with drinks in SF can cost $100+ and may require a McD run afterwards because the portions are made for ants. \n\na Mano has changed all of that. \n\nFrom the owner of Beretta, Belga, Delarosa, and Super Duper, a Mano is a Modern Italian restaurant serving handmade pastas at very SF wallet friendly prices. My friend and ordered one app, one pizza, two pastas, one entr\u00e9e, two desserts and one cocktail each, and our bill was $112 pre-tip. Ok, saying a $112 dinner tab is reasonable may sound ridiculous but this would have easily cost $160-$180 elsewhere in SF. Hello, $28 plate of [appetizer portion] pasta and $17 cocktails!\n\na Mano is walk-in only. To avoid a long wait, come before the dinner rush; 6 pm on the weekends. You cannot get on the waitlist until your entire party is there so unless all your friends are all punctual, it's probably not the best place for a large group dinner. \n\nWhile waiting to be seated, my friend and I grabbed drinks at their bar. I ordered the Sirena: Vodka, aperol, grapefruit, calabrian chili and she ordered the Wallbanger: Vodka, pineapple, mango, Galliano ($12): http://bit.ly/2qJu5d4. Loved the Sirena. It was well-balanced and citrusy with a mild kick. My friend's Wallbanger was on the fruitier, sweeter side. If you can't find seats at the bar, Anina and Brass Tacks are just several doors away from a Mano. \n\nEverything looked great on the menu so it was hard deciding on what to order. After some debate, we decided on the following:\n\n*Tuscan Duck Liver Mousse w/ kumquat mostarda ($9): 4.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2qjNMHe\nDeliciously rich and creamy, not too gamey. I wanted to lick the saucer clean. \n\n*Mostaccioli w/ braised tripe ($15): 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2pNLgGb\nOur least favorite dish of the night. While the tubular pasta was perfectly al-dente and the honeycomb tripe was melt-in-your mouth tender, it was a very bland dish. \n\n*Tagliatelle w/ pesto, english peas, fava, pine nuts ($15): 5 STARS\n http://bit.ly/2pCKlwc\nOne of the best pasta dishes I've ever had! Super flavorful and great varying layers of texture. The ribbons of pasta had a great toothsome chew. The crown of cheese shavings added a nice pop of saltiness while the toasted pine nuts added a great crunch. \n\n*Asparagus, green garlic, spring onion, lemon, caciocavallo ($15): 4.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2pPmAMD\nCrackly crust, stretchy cheese, oniony, and lightly citrusy. Simple yet ohh soo good. \n\n*Nightly Special: Porchetta w/ spigarello, red onion, salsa verde ($22): 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2ri8O6v\nA carniwhore's delight, the porchetta skin was crunchy and umptuous. The herb studded loin was tasty but a tad dry. The spigarello's subtle bitterness perfectly cut through all the porky richness.  \n\n*Dessert: http://bit.ly/2rj4apD\n--Buttermilk Panna Cotta w/ strawberries, biscotti ($9): 4 STARS\n--Nutella Sundae w/ fior di latte, amaretti cookie, whipped cream ($10): 4.5 STARS\n\nWe couldn't decide on one dessert so we ordered two. I'm not a chocolate person but the Nutella sundae was my favorite. The nutella and fior di latte ice cream was rich, dense, and not overly sweet which I appreciated. Simple but super satisfying. \n\nOur server was super friendly and cheerful but she was spread thin. It was a packed house on Saturday night so it was hard to track her down at times (not her fault). Luckily, they have a great team and other staff jumped in to take our food order. For opening week, the kitchen operated like a well-oiled machine and we were never left waiting for long between courses. Towards the end of dinner, one of the hostesses noticed us looking around for our server and jumped in to take our dessert order. Awesome teamwork! Thank you for being proactive and observant. \n\nLocated on the ground floor of a new luxury condo building, a Mano is very sleek, trendy, and hip. While it was a full house, it wasn't deafening like most SF hot spots. It was bustling but we could easily have a conversation without shouting across the table at each other. Great casual date place! \n\nParking has become a nightmare in almost every part of SF so take uber/lyft here especially on performance nights. \n\na Mano is one of the best new restaurants that I've been to this year.\n\nHooray for top-notch quality eats that won't leave your wallet nekkid!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Despite being seated in this space, our service was prompt, thorough, and attentive the whole meal through. Our courses were PERFECTLY paced - despite the lack of effort on our own part to plan that - and we somehow ordered just the perfect amount of food.\n\nHow was the food? Every dish was delightful, but in recap:\n\n- The lemon-chili cauliflower app: flavorful, and somehow managed feel both substantial and healthy at the same time. Just the right amount of spicy. Would highly recommend! \n- The squid app: nicely grilled, not chewy, also felt tasty/substantial over a bed of chickpeas and a nice romesco sauce\n- The funghi pizza: tasty and well-done, though the least remarkable of all the dishes we tried (we ended up bringing a couple slices home)\n- The chestnut pasta: OMG. I was reluctant to order this one, because ... what IS chestnut pasta? Have I ever eaten chestnuts, or is that just something you sing about at Christmas? But I'm so glad we ordered this dish, because it may well be the tastiest pasta I've ever had. It was light but creamy, cheesy, perfectly toothy ... I could have eaten two bowls to myself. \n- The squid ink pasta: Yum, yum. Garlic, lemon, olive oil and super well-made pasta, again perfectly cooked.\n- Nutella sundae: This is another one I was hesitant to order, based on the (detailed) description our waitress gave, including a type of mozzarella as part of the sundae. I couldn't get my head around it, but that didn't matter when the sundae arrived. It was elegant, familiar and comforting but also had unique twists at the same time.The whole thing disappeared. \n\nBeyond the food, the small details (delicious wine, good recommendations, the perfect size and weight of cutlery, clean bathrooms, overall ambiance) put a Mano over the top.

If you get here by 6, you might have to wait 1 hr 1/2 for people to finish within the first wave. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Reminds me of North Italia in LA with a modern Italian restaurant feel, open seating outside with heat lamps, a semi-open kitchen and a high table top area that faces both the inside and the outside.

I would suggest that and maybe a pizza to share as their pasta dishes are smaller in size.\n\nMALFADINE DUCK PASTA - malfadine is like the ends of lasagna with curves in long strips.  If you like duck, you'll enjoy this pasta although the duck wasn't super gamey and didn't have a very strong flavor.  The dish is light and slightly buttery/creamy but no heavy sauce.  I liked the currants which give it a sweet bite to it like you're eating raisins with your pasta.  Seems odd, but tastes good.  I loved that the pasta was fresh and chewy (al dente) and not overcooked or bland.\n\nSQUID INK PASTA - very good squid ink pasta with a good chew to it but beware that this is spicy! I can't handle spicy and it was bad for me and my husband can handle spicy and he was still saying it was a little too spicy.  Not a huge portion but if you have appetizers you should be OK.\n\nFUNGHI PIZZA - white pizza with pretty good flavor, the cheese was a little too mild for me though.  The crust is very bubbly and thicker but when you bite into it, it's more like a cracker/harder and not quite as chewy as I would have liked.

We went during the last day of their soft opening - there are definitely some things that can be worked on but I see lots of potential for this restaurant.

Super fatty and creamy mousse topped with a citrus element to cut through the fat. So simple but so delicious.\n\nTAGLIATELLE W PESTO, PEAS, FAVA, PINENUTS 3* - The pasta was cooked to perfect al dente in my opinon (my friend thought it was a tad overcooked), and sauce was tasty. Our pasta was significantly under salted, and needed a lot more salt which all 3 of us agreed on. This dish has potential to be a 4* dish.\n\nCAULIFLOWER, LEMON, CHILI, BAGNA CAUDA 3* - Roasted cauliflower with nice flavors, it was good but not amazing.

The ingredients are fresh, and it's an easy place to order family style and try a bit of everything (as the portions are not very big). They forgot our pasta and was reminded 2x and our pasta was very under salted which is a huge no no. The menu needs to be more solid as there were some very impressive dishes that we tried and thoroughly enjoyed, some that had careless mistakes and could be great, and others that fell flat and are not even comparable.

We arrived a little after 5 when they opened, and most of the restaurant was still pretty empty. Given that this restaurant is pretty popular, I was afraid it would fill up quickly after opening, but fortunately that wasn't the case.\n\nWe were quickly seated and given a menu. I started with the Aviazione ($12), which was gin, maraschino, lemon, violet, and soda. I was expecting it to taste more cherry-like due to the maraschino but any cherry taste was completely overpowered by the lemon. I wasn't the biggest fan of my drink, but I tried a sip of my friend's Wallbanger (vodka, mango mint, galliano) and that was very sweet and more up my alley. I'll have to get that for myself next time I come.\n\nFor food, we started with focaccia with an olive tapenade ($5) as we wanted something lighter before pasta. I loved the focaccia itself as that was very light and airy, but I stayed far away from the olive tapenade as I'm not a fan of olives. Also the focaccia was overly salty where they sprinkled too much salt and I couldn't imagine eating it with another savory spread.\n\nFor our mains, we opted to do family style and shared two pastas: the bucatini all' amatriciana ($14) and the tagliatelle ($15). They were both really good. The bucatini came piping hot to our table in a delicious tomato sauce. The noodles were nice and thick and each bite was very satisfying. The tagliatelle came in a pesto sauce and felt much lighter than the tagiatelle. The pesto was refreshing and the tagliatelle had a slight crunch to it when chewing that I typically don't experience with pastas. I'd say I liked the pasta in the bucatini more but the pesto sauce more with the tagliatelle.\n\nOne minor note - I asked for both pastas with cheese on the side since I don't like cheese on anything other than pizzas. Weird I know, but our server was super nice and said they could accommodate my request. Therefore I was kind of annoyed when both pastas came out to see that they were both topped with their respective cheeses! I ended up having to eat around the cheesy parts on top. \n\nDespite being stuffed, we opted for dessert and finished the meal with a panna cotta topped with strawberries. Pretty standard but it was nice to end the meal on a sweet note. \n\nWith tax and tip it was a little over $40 per person.", "author": "Dianna H."}

EVERY SINGLE ITEM was delicious, full of unique flavors and modestly priced. The five stars is well deserved. It is quite difficult in my opinion for a restaurant to capture all elements of a great dining experience but this certainly did. And on New Years Eve of all nights, they did not price gauge with an outrageous prix fixe menu which was a huge bonus.\n\nFor starters, we had the cauliflower and the beet arugula salad with hazelnuts. AMAZING. I have never had such perfectly fresh beets, and the combination with the gorgonzola and hazelnuts was just perfect. The entrees were straight out of food heaven. We had the nightly special which was a duck yolk ravioli and I havenever had such an amazing piece of work of a pasta. It was the star of the night amidst every other selection which was awesome. Our other entr\u00e9e was the mafladine braised duck leg and it too was so flavorful and hearty with perfectly tender duck (which I am a sucker of duck). And the dessert, was just perfect-- the chocolate budino with sea salt and the panna cotta were both perfectly light, and sweet.\n\nI left the restaurant feeling satisfied without feeling overly stuffed . And a $100 ticket for a three course meal for 2 people on New Years Eve was even better. The fact that they didn't take reservations and we could be seated within 30 minutes on New years was the icing on the cake of a great experience. Highly recommend", "author": "Lahiji F."}

My New York City roots always leave me looking for a trendy dinner place with good food and this was it.\n\nWe decided to go all out and started off with the fontina arancini which was fried risotto balls with fontina cheese, and sea salt focaccia with olive tapenade. The balls were not oily at all and very hot and steaming. It was super flavorful and the cheese didn't overpower. My boyfriend loved the olive tapenade with the house made bread as it was toasted and warm as well. We split the pork rigatoni and tagliatelle with mushrooms and kale. The rigatoni meat sauce was spicy and flavorful, SO GOOD. I didn't care much for the tagliatelle  as it was a butter sauce, and lacking some flavor though still a solid dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-20", "description": "Posting the 2-star review, since the opportunity to improve (at lunch, specifically) is quite real.\n\nI'm a huge fan of sister restaurant Beretta and have enjoyed Starbelly quite a bit too.  Since a Mano opened in happening Hayes Valley, I worried that it would be a bit too much of a cash grab and not push itself to far to provide an exceptional customer experience.\n\nDINNER in June -- my pregnant wife and I stopped by for an early dinner and a Mano significantly exceeded my expectations.  We ordered the fontina arancini and summer squash pizza and both were as great as the food at Beretta.   Decent service and drinks too.  Left feeling happy about the restaurant and could see myself returning.  4.25 stars/5\n\nLUNCH in July -- I really wish I wrote the date down so that management could track down who was working this day -- as they definitely need to improve lunch service.  We arrived mid-week around 1:45pm with a newborn baby and our dog, so we asked to sit outside.  The host did a good job at getting us into the shade, which is a little difficult in their sunny front outdoor area.  Aside from that EVERYTHING, was too slow.  My fears of a Mano being a cash grab seemed to be real (at least for lunch).  Waiter was nice, but did not come by very often (and again, we had a 2 week old baby who didn't need to eat for another hour and a half -- we could tolerate semi-slow but not this level of slow for a mid-week lunch!).  I think most of the slow pace of the meal came from the kitchen.  We got the strawberry and arugula salad (very good, but would still be good if your D team culinary staff were working that day) and the chicken polpettine (way underseasoned! we probably would have been sent it back had we not already sensed the slow pace of food coming out to everyone else around us).  Our original order around 2pm included the Summer Squash pizza and the Margherita pizza.  Around 3pm, we still hadn't received our pizzas, our waiter came by to say that the kitchen was at last call if we wanted to order anything else (but did not acknowledge the excessive wait for the Neapolitan pizzas we had ordered an hour ago).  Having a birds eye view of the restaurant/kitchen, I did see a line cook starting to work out pizza dough a little after 3p (nearly everyone around us had ordered pasta, so I was pretty certain it was ours).  As he was working out the dough, I noted that the dough was getting a really wide circumference and then I saw the line cook actively grimace as I think he noticed a tear or the dough becoming too thin towards the middle.  Instead of chucking the dough (sunk cost of less than $1 for the flour) and restarting, he continued to make the pizza (probably since he was worried since we ordered so long ago -- but never do this -- don't make us wait and then deliver us an inferior product).  We received the Summer Squash pizza about 10 minutes after I saw him start working out the dough (which felt long for a Neapolitan pizza like this, with no one else ahead of us in the queue).  The seasoning/flavor/temperature balance of the pizza was way inferior to the one that we had ordered for dinner a few weeks prior.  The worst part, however, was that there was a large section of incredibly thin crust towards the middle, the majority of it burnt through at the bottom.  This is a fairly junior varsity mistake for a pizza maker, and again, the line cook should have tossed the dough and restarted with new dough once he saw this error.  Margherita was better but nothing special.\n\nSo, to summarize, a Mano needs to improve its lunch service if they don't want it to be considered a pure cash grab.  When they announced lunch service, I got really excited since I'm off on paternity leave and eating outside seemed easy enough to do with a newborn.  However, it clearly seemed that a Mano was using this time not to serve their lunch patrons, but instead to grab some revenue during the day as they attend to their prep work for dinner service.  Very disappointing indeed for a first lunch out with a baby -- a baby which ended up crying all the way home after a nearly 2 hour midweek lunch pushed her mealtime back a half hour (damn, this story somehow ended with a crying baby...my apologies for that one).", "author": "Scott F."}

In another word, we love the food there. \n\nFirst of all, Be prepared that you might need to wait 30 to 45 minutes for seats for party of two. More people, the wait time may be longer. Good thing that you can sit at the bar to have a drinks while you are waiting if the bar is not full. They are very busy. But they will text you when seats are available. \n\nSecondly, let's talk about the food: \n\nWe ordered nightly special($25): red wine braised short ribs. MUST TRY! They are very good, surprisesily good. \n\nThe pasta, tagliatelle ($15) tasted very very good. \nAnother must try item too. \n\nTuscan duck liver mousse ($11), we really like it the way how they mixed the strawberries. Perfect balanced! \n\nCocktails Sirena ($12) was very good! \n\nOverall, They have excellent customer service and yummy food!

Didn't feel like settling for crap mediocre fast food and said screw it let me try this pasta since its hand made fresh it might taste better than the usual. Sure enough it was great!\n\nI went in wanting the spaghettini with clams after reading the street side menu. It was 45 minutes prior to closing so I went in quick and was seated. Unfortunately they were out of clams so I went for the tagliatelle. It came out and was cooked very well and had an excellent texture and light tasting pasta. Pasta has a tendency to make me feel very full and heavy after eating it but this had me feeling great. Definitely going to return earlier next time to get the spaghettini. \n\nNice clean modern decor inside. Nothing too \"try hard\" or awkwardly over complicated stuff which is very relaxing to me an a place I can enjoy coming back again and again.", "author": "Yosof R."}

I love how spacious the interior is, and that they have a glass counter so you can watch them handmake the pasta! I definitely got distracted during lunch a few times watching the chefs hand pull the pasta...\n\nI tried a salad (wild arugula, chioggia beets, gorgonzola, hazelnut, pickled shallot ) and the chestnut pasta here. The salad was really good, we got the large portion (which was still quite small, haha) and finished it all. The nuts were toasted and added a great crunch to the salad.\n\nThe pasta tasted really fresh, and the seasoning/sauce was sooooo good. I actually don't really know why I thought it was so good, but it just was so satisfying to eat. And the texture was just right and chewy, not too soft or hard. \n\nOne thing to note is that the portions are definitely smaller here. The large salad alone or the pasta alone would not fill a hungry person up, so if you're coming on a really empty stomach, order some sides in addition to a main.", "author": "Theresa L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "Long lines and waits.  Do they always mean that a restaurant is amazing?  No.  Sometimes hubs and I wonder who lines up the most for food - SFers, NYers, or those in LA.  We do love our lines in SF.  I've been wanting to try a Mano ever since I heard about their anticipated opening.  I honestly was a little skeptical because I wasn't much of a fan of Beretta, but the menu sounded amazing, and my friends loved it too when they went for dinner.  So, to avoid a long wait, we lined up outside on their outdoor seating about 30 minutes before opening the other Saturday.  We were third in line and chatted with a friendly couple.  The line grew and people tried of course to get inside.  10 minutes til, we stood up and waited by the door.  Shortly after some 40 year old blonde Real Housewives wannabe with her mini crew cut behind the people behind me claiming she had a reservation when the others that waited with us told her \"the line's back there.\"  a Mano doesn't take reservations at all and she tried to pull a lame fast one.  She walked into the restaurant (though not technically opened yet) and said something to the hostesses, they then pointed to the line and she stormed out and was angry.  \n\nDoors finally opened, staffed clapped and we were all seated.  The restaurant is actually a fairly good size and had blonde waited about 10 minutes afterwards she would've gotten in.  Tables are very close together.  We witnessed the couple next to us fight and storm off before they ordered, and then a VC meeting happened afterwards.  Oh SF!  Service at first was a bit slow as we were third to get seated yet everyone else got water before us.  After that service was much more attentive and very friendly.  He had a red to start and I had a prickly pear soda which was so refreshing & light.  To start we went with the cauliflower, and for our mains we did the nightly special which was a porchetta and the famous pesto tagliatelle.\n\nThe cauliflower was lightly pan fried and seasoned with lemon, chili, and bagna cauda, which is a hot dish mixed of anchovies, garlic, butter and olive oil.  Healthyish dish of the night and done right!  I asked one of the waiters if the arancini was the fried rice balls just filled with cheese, and he said yes, and asked if I wanted them, I said I did but that I'm trying to be healthy, and he amused me saying that everything I got was healthy.  Shortly, he brought us an order of arancini saying it was on him.  Bless his heart!  They were served piping hot, and were super cheesy on the inside.  It was served with some orange sauce which was very faint.  They weren't my favorite arancinis but they were pleasing.  How can you not like fried balls?  Next up were the entrees I've been waiting for.  The porchetta was a huge hunk of meat served with a light arugula side salad, pickled peppers, red onion and salsa verde.  The porchetta was moist with some fat on it, and most importantly the skin was nice and crispy!  Up there with RoliRoti's porchetta for sure.  Lastly, you have to have pasta at a Mano or else, you're a fool!  a Mano means by hand, so all the pasta is super fresh!  The tagliatelle was cooked right before al dente.  People said that this gives you extreme garlic breath.  I semi agree.  Later in the evening my breath still smelled like it but it was light, not overwhelming like I was about to slay some vampires.  One of the best pesto pastas I've had.  And yes, the waiter was right, it is healthy!  LOL  I mean it had haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, pesto, fava pineuts in it and seemed lighter on the parm in the pesto.  None of a Mano's dishes were overkill though I feared some of them were going to be rich.  I was getting full but hoping to sample some of their dessert.  Unfortunately, none of the desserts really tickled us so I had to pass.  \n\na Mano serves up great Italian food with a twist at affordable prices - pasta topping $15, appetizers $16 and under, and the porchetta was under $30.  Service was friendly and attentive, the space is mod and in an area where there's a ton of good food this place is a stand out.  Worth the wait.  Next time I'm back, I think I'll try another pasta dish and a pizza, who wants to come with?  4.5 stars rounded up.", "author": "Cat C."}

It has great non-fussy food, yummy cocktails and a relaxing vibe, all in a package that won't break the bank. \n\nI got the sirena and the hubby had the negroni. The sirena was well balanced and refreshing. Hubby liked his drink, too. \n\nWe ordered the chicken liver mousse and the calamari for appetizers and the gemelli and bucatini for our entrees. The liver mousse was just ok but the calamari was outstanding. The calamari was tender and plump and the corn is a perfect accompaniment to accentuate the sweetness of the protein. \n\nWe also enjoyed our pastas. I think all the pastas are made in house. It has the right amount of sauce and were al dente. My only complaint is that I wish they browned the pork bits a bit more to extract more flavor out of the bacon bits and render out a bit more of the fat, though. \n\nWish there are more places like a Mano, where it's casual without being too casual, serves good food and cocktails and you can leave the place for around $50/person.

I was the first to arrive and got there a little before 6pm. There were some tables open and seats at the communal table. a Mano does not take reservations, so this would be the perfect time to arrive as you will probably avoid a wait. Unfortunately for me, the whole party needs to be here in order to be seated, so I had to wait for all the stragglers. When our entire party of four were all present, the wait was 45 minutes, so we just grabbed three seats at the end of the bar and ordered drinks. (The restaurant takes your phone number and will text you when your table is ready. You have 5 minutes to claim it once you get the text.)\n\n*Americano: Campari, Sweet Vermouth, Soda ($10)\n*Negroni: Gin, Campari, Alessio Chinato ($12)\n*Cardinale: Gin, Luxardo Bianco, Dolin, Blanc, Grapefruit Bitters ($11)\n*Godfather: Bourbon, Scotch, Almond Bitters ($12) x2\n*Sirena: Aperol, Vodka, Grapefruit, Calabrian Chile ($12)\n*Manhattanero: Rye, Cynar, Italian Vermouth ($13)\n*Peroni ($5)\n\nOne of my friends ordered a Negroni, but I guess the bartender heard Peroni which is how we ended up with a beer. We just kept it as we have a beer drinker in the group. I started with the Manhattanero. I'm a fan of manhattans so I enjoyed this drink. For the second round, I got the Godfather. This was lighter than my first drink, so if you're going for the rye/scotch/bourbon drinks, I'd start with the Godfather and follow up with the Manhattanero.\n\n*Tuscan duck liver mousse, kumquat mostarda ($9)\n*Fontina arancini ($11)\n*Monterey squid, summer corn, roman-esco, shishito peppers ($13)\n*Margherita, tomato, fior di latte, basil ($12), add Arugula ($2)\n*Tagliatelle, pesto, english peas, fava pinenuts ($15)\n*Spaghettini, clams, chili, lemon, pangratatto ($15)\n*Bucatini all' amatriciana, tomato, pancetta, pecorino ($14)\n*Cabernet Blend, Frescobaldi, Toscana 2014 ($13)\n\nWe moved to our table 46 mins after I put my name down. (I checked the texts for the amount of time we waited.) We had already talked about the food we wanted while drinking at the bar, so we knew what we wanted to order. We did everything family style, so I got to try all the dishes. My fav by far was the tagliatelle. That pesto was sooo good! I could have finished the plate all by myself. I also liked the duck liver mousse. Nice and creamy. I thought the rest of the dishes were good overall. The arancini was crispy and cheesy. The squid was tender with a nice chew. I adored the shishito peppers and corn. I'm actually not a huge pasta person, so I thought the other two pastas were okay. I liked the clams in the spaghettini, but I wished the bucatini had more sauce. The pizza was a little disappointing. The outside crust was soft with a great chew, but the middle was kinda soggy. Plus there wasn't much cheese on the pizza. I wanted more!\n\nFun new spot in Hayes Valley. If you want to avoid a wait, make sure to show up before 6pm. And order the pesto tagliatelle.

Arancinis were decent and I would be ok skipping it next time and reserving the carb allowance for their pastas instead. \n\nOverall service was attentive, friendly, pleasant and prompt. \n\nA Mano hasn't been opened long however I see it is quickly establishing itself as one of the focal dining destination of this ever changing neighborhood.", "author": "Esther A."}

A Mano has become my go-to Italian spot in the city and is a place I always bring friends who are visiting SF, or SF-friends who hadn't discovered it yet. Sitting outside or inside, eating dinner or brunch, I have never been disappointed.  The arancini, rigatoni, and pesto pasta are not to be missed.  I've also been lucky enough to eat in Harry's section a few times and now have come to request him if he happens to be working!  He is so personable and is a true professional. He has always come through with spot on food and cocktail recommendations.  I trust his taste completely!  I appreciate that he doesn't hover around too much which can be annoying, but also somehow magically knows when you need attention.  Put A Mano on your rotation for go-to restaurants in the city and ask for Harry.  It's the best!!", "author": "Jamie C."}

The nice thing is that their wait list system allows you to check what position you're in on the phone and receive text alerts when your table is ready, so you can stroll through Hayes Valley to kill time instead of just waiting outside the restaurant. For as popular and well received as a Mano is, I was surprised by how cheap it ended up being for an italian restaurant with homemade pasta! All the pasta dishes were below $20 and the portions are actually fairly substantial unlike some other spots (cough cough Barzotto). If only the lines were shorter, we'd probably go a lot more often. For now though it'll only be for times when we plan ahead enough in time.", "author": "Stephany L."}

One hour wait. *Text will be sent when your table is ready\n \nValue - $15 / dish.\n \nDish Size: Medium size. One entr\u00e9e was enough per person\n \nWallbanger - The mango flavor is strong with just a hint of alcohol. Well balanced drink.\n \nRossini - Extremely refreshing. The bubbles made it feel like you were actually biting into a straweberry.\n \nMonterey squid (summer corn, roman-esco, shishito peppers) - Must order. The squid was cooked perfectly on the grille. Slightly charred outside but still completely melt in your mouth buttery.\n \nSpaghettini (clams, chili, lemon, pangrattato) - A tasty dish with a prominent seafood forward flavor. Pasta and clams were cooked perfectly. There was just the right amount of spice from the chili which added an extra pop to the dish.\n \nTagliatelle (pesto, haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, pinenuts) - A bit disappointed that there wasn't a stronger pesto presence. Besides that, all the components were cooked well.\n \n \nWe attempted to test our luck and walk-in to a Mano at 18:00 on a Saturday night. However, when we arrived the entire place was packed and there was a line out the door. The hostess said the wait would be around an hour for a table of two. To the benefit of a Mano, the location is perfect as there's plenty of stuff around to make the hour wait fly by. A stone throws away, we ended up at Biergarten to have a couple drinks outside as we waited. A little less than a hour, we get a text saying our table is ready. I really do appreciate when you get a text instead of having to loiter around and wait to hear your name be called.\n \nThe space is large with both indoor and a row of outdoor seating. A major plus is the outdoor seating does have heat lamps which is perfect for a chilly day. The interior definitely follows the hip and trendy formula with the touch of industrial details accented by warm wood elements. The interior pairs well the crowd, which leans towards the younger bourgeois generation - a perfect fit for Hayes Valley.\n \na Mano has to be considered as a full package. There is definitely much better pasta joints elsewhere in the city. However judging the location, vibe, and value as a whole, a Mano is hard to beat. Would I wait an hour for a Mano if there wasn't all the other shops around- a resounding no. But there is, to the benefit of a Mano.\n \n \nThe best dish by far was the Monterey squid resting on top a bed of summer corn. The squid was cooked perfectly on the grille with a slight charred outside but still completely melt in your mouth buttery. I have a feeling the corn must have been cooked in the squid juices because the corn flavor was amazing. The corn was perfectly cooked with a slight bite to it when chewed.", "author": "Julian L."}

We went at 5:45 on a Thursday and it was already pretty much full. Luckily, there was a table outside and they had heated lamps that made it comfortable enough to sit there.

We ordered: \n****Monterrey Squid: amazing take on calamari. Not for the squeamish as you can literally see the squid on your plate. The consistency of the squid was to dieeee for and the sauce the accompanied it was so unique and delicious. If you have had the octopus at Lolinda it's the same vibe but BETTER. \n*****Spaghettini w/ Clams: BEST PASTA I'VE HAD IN MY 26 YEARS. I am not one to order pasta, but all pasta here is made by hand (\"a Mano\") so I figured we needed to try it. Such a crazy fusion of spices, sauces, seasoning, and yes - the pasta. Just do yourself a favor and get this dish. \n*****Margareta Pizza: Good, but very much overshadowed by the pasta. If you need to make a choice, skip the pizza. \n*****Nutella Sundae: Gelato was amazing! Nutella sauce very tasty. Great way to end an amazing meal. \n\nDRANKS (4/5) \nCocktails were tasty, but please don't make the same mistake as me and skip the \"Vino de la casa\". It is NOT good, and had I known that I would've gladly paid the few bucks extra for another wine.\n\nSERVICE (4/5) \nFriendly!

I found this place and the food looked yummy so we decided to meet here. We had a larger party of 7, but I didn't realize you probably needed to get there around 4 or 5 to be seated around 7:00 for dinner. We needed to sit outside because we had a puppy too, so that was our other mistake. My sister got there around 6:30 and called to tell me that the wait could be as long as 3 hours and we were number 32 on the list. I got there a minute later and decided we should wait it out for a bit and get drinks at the bar. After an hour we were number 15 on the waitlist and it looked like many more seats would be opening both inside and outside, which they did. We were at spot number one for way too long while we watched many people getting sat outside. This obviously irked us. They were not trying to be accommodating and push tables together, or wait for a table that was close to being done to put tables together. According to their online table system we were next for about an hour. My cousin ended up leaving because it was too much, so our table size when down a person. The straw that broke the camels back, was when a table that was actually big enough opened up for us OUTSIDE and one of the hostesses told us we were next, they sat another large party because they had 8 people and the table sat 8 people. I couldn't believe it. Horrible service. We ended up leaving because it was 10:00 and we were hangry. We went across the street to the little Mexican restaurant and they gladly seated us. My sister finally got a text around 10:30 that our table was ready, that would have meant it would have been a 4 hour wait. I don't think any restaurant is worth that. What a joke.\n\nMaybe one day I'll try it again and get there earlier and not have a puppy with us, but probably not until they have some type of reservation system in order.", "author": "Margaret S."}

That will probably change as a Mano gains more popularity. Good attentive service. My friend and I split a salad and 2 pastas. a Mano encourages you to share, family style. Honestly I wanted every pasta dish on the menu but we were merely a party of 2. Looking back, I think I could've tackled it. It came down to the bucatini all' amatriciana or the tagliatelle for me. My friend said he felt the tagliatelle would just be any old pesto so he managed to sway me toward the bucatini. \n\nMy friend and I split the mostaccioli w/ braised tripe, and the bucatini all' amatriciana. If you are not a lover of tripe, then do not get the mostaccioli. The tripe flavor definitely comes through in that dish. Disclaimer: I love tripe. The pasta was al dente so it was substantial, but I did wish it had something a bit more dense or crunch in the dish so that the overall texture would be better. Still found it to be good. \n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED the bucatini all' amatriciana. My favorite pasta of all pastas is bucatini and amatriciana is packed full of flavor. The tomato, the pancetta, the garlic.. Not too acidic, not overly salty, perfectly al dente with just the right amount of pecorino too. My favorite of the night. \n\nAs much as I loved the amatriciana, I really think we should've split the tagliatelle as well. Nearly every table had ordered it. My friend said he had never really had a deep appreciation for freshly made pasta until a Mano. I told him he has been depriving himself. The way Aziz feels about pasta in Master of None is the way I feel about pasta. Season 2 reeeeaaaaaaaally pushed my pasta cravings. Before we even finished, my friend declared that he wanted to go on a pasta binge. I excitedly volunteered as tribute. Look at you, turned him into a fan! He is already binging hard because he went back to a Mano the very next night and ordered every pasta dish. No tagliatelle though, because you guys sold out. I KNEW IT!

You have your Cotogna, Flour + Water, Central Kitchens... but all those places are $20+ per bowl of pasta. I get that you have to pay for quality, but a Mano is a godsend in the Italian food scene in SF that serves really high quality pasta that doesn't break the bank. \n\nThe SO and I came for dinner on Friday of opening week. We showed up at 6:15 pm (foolish) and were told that there would be a 45 min wait. Not actually a big deal since it's Hayes Valley and you can just grab a drink while you're waiting. They use a texting system to queue here which is great so you're not just stuck waiting in line. We actually got called back after 20 min which isn't too bad of a wait for a Friday night dinner at a new pretty popular restaurant.\n\nLet's start with the space at a Mano -- I love it. They have floor to ceiling walls that look out onto the street, tons of seats, it's a really aesthetically pleasing place to eat at.\n\nFor drinks, I had the Rossini which was a super tasty opening cocktail. Would recommend if you're not a big fan of the taste of alcohol. \n\nFood wise, we did two apps and two pastas:\nMonterey squid - wasn't a huge fan of this dish personally, but mostly because the base was beans. Resembled almost a bean/tomato soup texture as the base and squid on top. While the squid was tasty, the mixture of ingredients doesn't personally resonate\n\nCauliflower - delicious. Nicely roasted cauliflower seasoned with lemon and chili is one of my favorite preparations. No complaints here. Super tasty\n\nAgnolotti del plin with roast chicken and pork - Agnolotti is always such a funny dish to be because basically it's like little pasta dumplings. I thought they were quite good. Tasty filling with a nice creamy sauce -- solid safe agnolotti option. \n\nMostaccioli, braised tripe -- took a bit of a risk here as I usually don't see tripe outside of Chinese restaurants. I enjoyed this dish, though the SO thought that the sauce was almost too tripe flavored and would have preferred something that offered a more balanced flavor. I thought it was honestly fine. I enjoyed the mostaccioli though I thought they were a bit big, and the braised tripe was well cooked. Overall, a good dish as well. \n\nDespite the busy night, service was what you'd expect at a more casual eatery like a Mano. They were attentive when they needed to be which is all you can really expect. Fairly good for an opening week run -- usually service can be a lot worse in the beginning. \n\nFinal price came out to be $80 -- you really can't get high quality pasta at the price elsewhere. a Mano is a great addition to Hayes -- can't wait to come back and try more dishes!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Just like every SF restaurant, there is a long wait. That's just a part of life here.  I love that there is a ton of bars that you can go to while you wait to be seated. They text you when your table is ready. We went to smugglers (a subject of another review. Loved it)Drinks: Everyone had a round of The Godfather. It's a glorified old fashion. \nAppetizers:  We started with the olives and cauliflower. The cauliflower is perfectly roasted with chopped up peppers that add a little bit of a kick. The olives are delish. \nEntrees: Pancetta pizza with asparagus. It was okay. I was underwhelmed. Will go with the margherita  next time. The pork ragu was my absolute favorite. Pasta was perfectly al dente. Lastly, the fusilli... it was just okay. \nDessert: only based on the panna cotta. FAIL. Just take it off your menu. It's a classic Italian dessert. And the texture was completely off. Usually, you will get a nice compote to sweeten it up. And their chopped strawberries seemed like an afterthought.", "author": "Mayra R."}

I expected a long wait when we arrived because of how new the place was, but we were seated right away after speaking to the host. From start to end, service was excellent. \n\nI ordered the Sirena cocktail (Aperol, Vodka, Grapefruit, Calabrian Chile) and thought it was a very thoughtfully designed drink - just enough bitterness and kick. Between the two of us, we shared the fritto misto appetizer (deep fried shrimp, squid, fennel, and spring onion) and loved how crisp and light everything tasted. I love fried squid but there are far too many places I've been to that don't make it well, and you're left with a mouth coated with oil. No such thing here! For my entree, I ordered the spaghettini with clams. I was very impressed with this dish. Pasta was cooked perfectly (I wouldn't expect any less), portion size was perfect, clams were cleaned well (no sand), and the sauce wasn't too heavy. \n\nA Mano is the new kid on the block in Hayes Valley, and it looks like they're taking the crowd feedback very seriously. Another Yelper reported their pasta being under salted, and I experienced no such thing. If I had to be picky, one thing that could improve my experience is if some bread was available to munch on while waiting on the appetizers. The sheet pan of focaccia in the kitchen looked quite delicious.\n\nIn any case, I'm definitely coming back again! :)", "author": "Austin W."}

There was already a long line formed outside, so coming early was a great call.\n\nIt's a cute spot, right in the middle of downtown Hayes with big windows overlooking the street. Simple, trendy decor. Super nice waiting staff. From our table, we could watch the chefs prepare the pasta from scratch.\n\nWe started with cocktails and then split a bunch of dishes: \n- cauliflower appetizer (to die for, you must order this)\n- rigatoni with pork sugo\n- tagliatelle with pesto, haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, and pine-nuts (CRYING SO GOOD)\n- summer squash pizza with zucchini blossom, stracciatella, vidalia onion, lemon\n\nIt was way too much food for just 2 people, and we had ZERO regrets.

Like come on you're pouring lemon juice concentrate out of a squeeze bottle into my drink.. you have no reason to be acting like you're the best bartender I'll ever have. \n\nA server dropped off our food just as we were getting up to be seated and instead of just taking it to our table he plopped it down on the counter.

A Mano is the new hot restaurant in town because anytime you come here it's always a 30+ minute wait for a table! The lesser rating is mainly for crowd control and the hostess who was managing seating. Pasta for this price point and quality cannot be beat. I went with a large group of six after work and arrived around 6pm. There was only bar seating available without a wait, but the hostess religiously follows the \"whole party must be present to be seated\". I understand that restaurants want to maximize diners, but I honestly felt it was a bit rude that the hostess forgot that we had been waiting outside for a good 30 minutes for the other half of our party who was stuck in traffic to arrive and asked if I had put my name down for a reservation. I almost had a heart attack because she had told me that I was \"in line for the bar seating once my party arrived\". This was the main detraction from my experience at a Mano given I had been so excited to eat here for several weeks. \n\n[Dinner]\nA very reasonably priced restaurant with huge and fresh pasta portions. We got the focaccia with the olive spread for the table and the bread was great. I got the bucatini dish and for $15 dollars, the portion was huge. Most of my coworkers did not finish their entrees. The pasta was very fresh and cooked al dente how I prefer my pasta. The sauce was a little salty, but definitely complemented the pasta very well. \n\n[Drinks]\nWe split a bottle of the Montepulciano and at $32 was the cheapest bottle on the menu. However, I thought the wine tasted great and was really a value split in our group of six. There is also a great selection of wines and cocktails to choose from. If you can get here early enough, this would be a great date spot! \n\n[Service] \nService was fast and attentive. We probably got our food less than ten minutes after we placed our order.\n\nDefinitely worth trying if you're able to secure a table without a two hour wait and an amazing addition to Hayes Valley!", "author": "Alice Z."}

The focaccia was crispy and fluffy at the same time and went beautifully with the olive oil and tapenade.

However, the service and the food were outstanding. Came here for a girlfriend's birthday in a group of 7 and did family style. We ordered a lot to try and still the bill came out to be $44 per person including the birthday girl's share and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. For starts we had:\n\n- cauliflower with lemon, chili, bagna cauda: deliciously healthy and crispy - lots of flavor on the surface but the inside of the cauliflower lacked, but I still enjoyed it.\n- Monterey squid, corn, roman-esco, shishito peppers: loved the flavor in the corn and squid! Full squid pieces went well with the corn and it's small kick of spice. Would reorder!\n- arugula, stone fruit, Gorgonzola, hazelnut and pickled shallots: delicious and refreshing! Loved the peaches and the mixture of texture in this dish. Love arugula and would recommend.\n- Margherita pizza: delicious with the egg on top. Thin crust and perfectly enough for everyone to try a slice before moving onto entrees.\n\nMain courses:\n- tagliatelle pesto with pine nuts: this one lacked flavor compared to our other pasta dishes. My least favorite.\n- spaghettini with clams: second to least favorite but had crispy bits on top that added texture to the dish. Also not that flavorful but still enjoyed it as it was lighter than the other pasta options and became a good balance.\n- rigatoni with pork: one of my favored dishes and recommend ordering! Rich in flavor with delicious melted Parmesan on top.\n- gemelli with lamb sausage: surprisingly my favorite dish when I don't eat lamb! It was not gamey in flavor at all and had the richest flavor out of all of them. I highly recommend this dish.\n- bucatini with tomatoes and pancetta: also very delicious for a usual pasta dish. In my top three :)\n- Bavette steak: very tender and perfectly sliced for everyone to grab a piece. I suggest pastas over this dish if you had to remove something.\n\nDesserts:\n- pistachio gelato: my favorite dessert of the night. Strong legit pistachio flavor with real pistachio pieces all around :)\n- strawberry sorbetto: my second favorite with a sweet and tart strawberry flavor among strawberry bits\n- Nutella sundae: one of my least favorite dessert of the 4, because it wasn't anything special or different.\n- buttermilk panna cotta: perfectly sweet and had strawberry bits on top. Third favorite :)\n\nWe left satisfied and not overly full. Great spot to do family style :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

Then we tried coming on Burning Man Sunday at 4:55pm, and there were only 15 people or so ahead of us in line. By around 5:40pm, the restaurant filled up for the first round.  When we left around 7pm, the line was pretty long.\n\nI came on a mission for pasta, but they had pretty good drinks with an Italian flare.\n- Sirena: grapefruit, vodka based, refreshing, very light\n- Wallbanger: vodka based with mango, also good for summer \n- Godfather: spirit driven, strong, with a hint of almond (like an old fashioned)\n\nAntipasti: \n- Monterey squid: baby squid sitting on top of summer corn with various colored shishitos and a romanesco sauce.  I thought the squid could have used a bit more salt, but the corn was amazingly fresh and sweet \n\nPastas:\n- Tagliatelle: fresh pasta, on the thinner side, with pesto, haricot verts, fingerling potatoes (sliced thin), and pine nuts. I thought the haricot verts and potato were an interesting touch \n- Paccheri: I got this for the early early pomodoro, but the cherry tomatoes were also great, and the pasta texture was just right. It also came with flash fried eggplant, and capers all worked really well\n- Torchetti: spiral pasta with house made lamb sausage, broccoli di ciccio, olives, garlic, chili. This one was a flavor bomb - I liked it a lot\n\nWe were tempted to get the agnolotti and rigatoni, but it was a super warm day, and those felt more like winter pastas. \n\nThe pizzas looked pretty good, but the pasta seemed better.  They do thin crust pizza, but the crust wasn't as thin as at some other Neapolitan places.\n\nThe staff was really friendly, and despite the crowd outside, they don't make you feel rushed.\n\nAlso, every pasta was $14-16, which is very reasonable for SF.  The pizzas ranged from only $12 for the Margherita to $16.  Overall, it was really reasonably priced as far as SF pasta/pizza goes.  \n\nWould I wait 2 hours?  No, but I would wait up to 30 min.  Coming right around opening time worked out well to sit in the first wave of diners.   I think you can actually put your name down and come back when your table is ready.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

I hope they are just working out the kinks. I'm a huge pasta and wine lover, so I was really hoping for some magic.\n\nAfter reading some reviews, I laughed because everyone from a couple months ago was complaining about the lack of salt. Maybe my experience was in direct response to that? Our pasta was so outrageously salty, we couldn't finish either dish.\n\nAside from the abundance of salt, the bucatini and tagliatelle pasta itself was fine If not a bit soft, but I was really disappointed in the sauces. So bland.\n\nThe gem salad with anchovies was solid, that adds a star on its own. The two itty bitty anchovy slices however, deduct it back. The ratio was two tiny bites on a salad big enough for two people. Aranchinis we're fine, as it's pretty hard to dislike a fried cheesy dish.\n\nThe wine choices were a little off. My first glass was definitely spoiled (maybe because the wine on the wall is in the sun during the day?) and when I politely apologized and asked the bartender about it, he just said \"that's the way it tastes\" without even bothering to check. It was a wine that I personally drink a lot and enjoy, so I was a little put off by his response as if I just didn't know better.

The restaurant was loud but not so much that I couldn't hear myself. Drinks took a while to come.\nOverall, our bill for 2 drinks, appetizer, pizza, and pasta with tip came out to be $80.

This restaurant deserves to be lauded for its great service, its excellent food, and the aforesaid done with reasonable prices. Executive chef Freedom Rains creates quality pasta; pasta that is light, delicious, and fresh reflecting the undemanding summer weather of San Francisco. The drink choices reflect the pasta and combined with the atmosphere, produces a superb dining experience.\n\nThe spaghettini had a nice balance of acidity and spice. Though I thought the combination of clams and bread crumbs would be an odd choice, the dish came together to create a meal that excelled expectations.\n\nThe agnolotti dal plin were bites of flavor that deserved savoring. The parmesan, speckled like little snowflakes on top, started melting onto the pasta. However, before they even had the chance to melt, they were gone. \n\nItalian cuisine faces constant scrutiny on tradition versus reinvention, or heavy sauce versus a lighter Spaghetti Aglio e Olio. Many restaurants sway towards the former in both categories, but a Mano tries to break the norm.  While lighthearted and simple on the outside, the meal is complex on the subterranean level, reflecting the food norms and values changing in the Bay Area.", "author": "Shounak C."}

Despite them seeming really busy he took the time to thoroughly describe all the pasta dishes for me. Then he helped me decide between the two I'd narrowed it down to ( so, if it's going to be your last meal... which one?) My wife ordered the nightly special  which was braised short ribs with greens, carrots and onions.  I went with the tagliatelle al ragu. We also ordered the beet salad. The salad came out promptly and was delicious. I really love beets but these golden beets were exceptional. \nAs for our entrees, the short ribs were amazing the knife provided was certainly there for show as a fork was all that was needed. Probably the best short ribs we've had amazing flavor and the vegetables were cooked nicely al dente.  My pasta dish was also really good, great flavor and the pasta was perfect. Fresh made pasta really makes a difference. Only thing that would have made it better would have been a little more meat in the sauce but I can say that about most any pasta dish. \nMy second choice would have been the seafood pasta and a few of the folks around us ordered it, looked really good If we'd been there with another couple I'd have ordered one just to share it was that tempting. \nWill have to make it back before they change up the menu.

It's reasonably priced for the exceptional quality, and all the dishes are super filling. The first two times I went, shortly after it opened, I didn't have to wait, and this time we were quoted for 1.5 hours for a table for 2 but were able to find seats at the bar.\n\nI'm writing this review for the EXCEPTIONAL service at the bar. Midway through dinner with my friend, a man decided to wedge himself between me and the party to my right. We were two groups of two women, and this man was really invading my personal space--trying to sit on the stool with me. I asked him to move a few times, and the bartender took note and told the man that he could see the menu and be served at the end of the bar. \n\nWhen the guy moved, I asked the two girls to my right if he were part of their group, they said no. After getting his drink, the guy reappeared between us, and the bartender once again intervened by firmly telling the man he had to stand at the end of the bar and not between people because it infringes their personal space. \n\nMr. No Personal Space moved, lurked around, and then reappeared on the other side of my friend. This time another staff member came over and checked in with us, asked the check for Mr. Stranger-Danger, dumped out his drink, and stood by us until he left. \n\nI'm writing this review because I greatly appreciate the level of attentiveness by the bartenders and staff. I often feel that I have to fend off these uncomfortable advances on my own, but at a Mano, the staff were very aware of the situation and took appropriate measures to address the issues as they continued and developed. I felt that the staff responded well to assure us that they were aware and made sure we knew they were willing to intervene and take care of the situation.\n\nThis place is one of my favorite new restaurants in San Francisco, but after this experience, I'll be sure to visit this place many many times in the future.

I went on Friday night with friends and waited for an hour and a half and were seated around 10pm, but it was well worth the wait. All of their pastas are made fresh and by hand (hence their name), and you can really tell they give a lot of care to the food they cook.\n\nTo start, we shared the squid with sweet corn and that was absolutely cooked to perfection. The savoriness of the squid was well balanced with the corn. I guess it's a popular item on their menu because we overheard a waiter tell people next to us that they were sold out of the squid soon after we had ordered ours.\n\nWe each ordered a different pasta, but we loved all of our choices. I personally had the bucatini all'amantriciana with pancetta and tomato sauce - the last time I had amantriciana that was that delicious was at Piccolo Buco in Rome. My sister opted for mostaccioli with braised tripe. Even if you're not a fan of tripe, I think anyone would like this pasta. One of my friends had agnolotti dal plin (which is like ravioli) with roast chicken and pork, which I personally thought was a little on the heavier side. He got hungry later on and had the tagliatelle with pesto. Not my favorite of the pastas we had, but it was quite refreshing to have, especially after eating so much food. Another friend had the spaghettini and clams - boy, do they give you A LOT of clams! It was good, but not the standout of the night, in my opinion.\n\nWe finally had dessert: my sister and I had the panna cotta and my friends shared the affogato. The panna cotta had the perfect jiggly texture and taste - highly recommend. I wasn't a fan of the espresso used for the affogato; it had a bit of an overextracted taste. If you  want dessert, I think the panna cotta would be a better choice than the affogato.\n\nOverall, I'm a huge fan of a Mano and I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu! Shoutout to our waiter that night! I don't remember his name, but he gave us so many great recommendations and we enjoyed most of it.", "author": "Trisha V."}

We ordered four pastas, none of which wowed me, and the service was...ehh.  Water was dripping on us from an AC line, it wasn't a great experience.\n\nHowever, I'm a huge believer that you shouldn't judge nor review a restaurant in its first few months, and this is why.  Our second trip to A Mano was seamless and just incredible.  They're up and running and in excellent form.\n\nWe ordered three pastas, the clam spaghettini, the pesto tagliatelle, and rigatoni with pork sugo.  We were also comped the focaccia for some reason.  For what it's worth, the three pastas were the perfect amount to split between two (hungry) people.  Each dish seems to have been tweaked slightly from the opening week, all for the better.\n\nThe clam spaghettini was perfect.  The clams were excellent, the dish had a nice kick to it while still remaining refreshing, I would get this again in a heartbeat.  The pesto tagliatelle was really fresh and flavorful, it needed a bit of salt though.  The rigatoni was ridiculous.  Just bursting with flavor.  The focaccia was probably the best I've ever had, amazing salt on top (I'm a salt fiend, admittedly).  We'd order all four dishes again, with the rigatoni and spaghettini being our favorites.  It was hot and we each ordered two glasses of the pinot noir sparkling rose.\n\nI really wish we'd gotten our waiters name because he was excellent.  Funny, engaging, checked in the perfect amount of time.  \n\nThree pastas and four glasses of rose set us back $80.  That's a total steal for SF.  If we had each had one pasta and one glass of wine, and weren't gluttonous alcoholics, the price point would have been unbeatable for this neighborhood.\n\nWe were seated right away but we arrived at 5:50 on a Thursday.  We had to wait the first time, but both Anina and Brass Tacks next door have great ambiance and are a fun place to wait, and they text/call you when your table is ready.\n\nAlready dreaming about going back -- this is the perfect fast casual spot that Hayes has needed.\n\nThe pizzas and the squid dish looked incredible...we'll be back to try those as well.", "author": "James S."}

Found it on the map on the way home so we gave it a try. Apparently it had been open not more than a month when we went.\n\nOverall, it was just very mediocre. Don't believe the hype and I'm not drinking the koolaid.\n\nIt wasn't overly busy but we were sat in the middle of the restaurant where staff and guests would brush by our chair every few minutes. The service was, ironically, a little overbearing and lacking at the same time with the waiter constantly reaching between us or moving stuff on our table but missing when we needed water or another drink. It was the service of a checked out career server where they ticked all the boxes but without actually paying attention and responding appropriately.\n\nTo start, we each got a serviceable, not necessarily enjoyable cocktails. It just didn't taste like the 'crafted' cocktails you would find at many other fine bars in SF, but rather a mix of alcoholic liquids like when experimenting at home, riffing off recipe and come up with a dud.\n\nApps started with the liver mousse and Monterey squid. \nPate tasted like tinned stuff you get in holiday gift baskets, not much in the way of seasoning and served with 5 slices of oily grilled bread and a jam that didn't do much to complement. \nSquid lacked the briny pop that would've brought this dish together. It almost didn't make sense why it was served together as a result.\n\nMains were tagliatelle with pesto and mostaccioli with tripe.\nHard to mess up pesto and it ended up being the one dish we did like but it was like having pesto in a flavorless vessel. The pasta didn't speak for itself, its texture was slightly overcooked and the pesto just ever so slightly astringent. \nThe mostaccioli was even more underwhelming, tasting similar to the romesco sauce with a healthy spoonful of salted pasta water. Anything offal piques my interest but barely any tripe was found to complement, used almost sparingly like garnish. Sauce didn't have much depth outside of a slight funk that could've just as well come from the cheese. The star ingredient could've shined but instead tasted very one note.\n\nYour typical hyped restaurant in a popular neighborhood selling the idea of authenticity veiled in mediocrity. You come here mostly for a place to sit and fill your belly, not quite for a memorable meal or taste of home. My impression is that they were afraid of flavors and everything gets muddled as a result. Don't think we'll be coming back here.", "author": "Peel S."}

We went a few doors down to Brass Tacks for a drink, and they called us just 30 minutes later. Of course we were thrilled to be seated early but had to force down the drinks we just got at BT - seems like they're still working out some kinks in wait times. \n\nThe food: for apps, we ordered the duck liver mousse and the squid. Both were delicious! The mousse was the perfect amount of rich, and the kumquat jam was a really nice, acidic touch. The squid was also really nicely done, with a delicious romanesco sauce. There were a few too may shishito peppers for my taste, but overall it was yummy.\n\nEntrees: my SO ordered the osso buco (the nightly special), my friend ordered the agnolotti, and I got the bucatini. His osso buco was so good! The meat was done perfectly, the polenta was creamy, and the portion size was great. My friend's agnolotti (mini ravioli) was decent, although the portion size was kind of small - just 14 or so small pieces, with each being about a quarter of a ravioli.\n\nNow to my bucatini - I honestly can't understand why it's one of the most popular pastas here (per our server). The pasta was super thick and chewy, it was not seasoned (I struggled to find any pancetta in the dish), and the tomato sauce smelled so sour it reminded me of something quite the opposite of food (I'll spare you the details). I tried to take a few bites but really didn't like it. Our server was incredibly kind and accommodating, and I ordered the campanelle instead.\n\nThis was a ribbon pasta (much better texture than the bucatini) that would have been great with just some cheese, because this dish was too, too much. It was like they threw half the kitchen into this dish - it was so busy with so many conflicting flavors, I didn't quite understand it and didn't like it either. Though better than the bucatini, the lemon and olives were so overpowering, that was all I could taste. I had an unpleasant lingering olive taste in my mouth for the rest of the evening (until we got gelato!).\n\nWe didn't try the pizzas and maybe those are worth a try, but the pasta here is nothing special (we tried 3 and none were that good). A little overhyped, imo. Apps were great, but we probably won't be back.", "author": "Anna M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-09", "description": "a Mano is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. The fresh pasta alone is enough to bring anyone there. The mafladine is nothing short of epic. I am looking forward to trying some the other things the menu, but if it's you're first time and you don't have any issues with eating duck, you pretty much are obliged to order this as your entr\u00e9e. The cauliflower anitpasti is also amazing, bringing the ordinarily mundane vegetable to breathtaking heights never seen before.\n\nTheir wait service is also very attentive and were able to come up with beverage choices that were non-alcoholic that were something other than water and diet coke. I appreciated her knowledge of the menu and genuine desire to make sure we were happy with our meal and overall experience.\n\nWhat's more, the prices at a Mano are oddly reasonable, especially considering the location and quality of the meals. Hayes Valley is famed for its ability to sell tiny portions of food to astronomical prices. It's almost like the restaurant owners and chefs meet after work at a bar and dare each other to see how much they can gouge their customers, knowing there will always be some nouveaux riches millennial who will pay quadruple of what something is worth as long as it branded in a lower case helvetica font with minimal coloring. a Mano is not one of those locations- the prices are decidedly fair. What's more, there usally is nothing more than a short wait, even at 8 PM on a Saturday, though I don't expect this to be the case for much longer, so get a reservation if you can.\n\nOne thing I noted is that the hostess that was working there when I was there was downright hostile to the idea of having to do any sort of work. I attempted to reserve a table via yelp and she would immediately cancel it. When I showed up in person to put my name in I told her that we'd be just outside the door under the heat lamps since it was too crowded at the bar and she started to whine about how she wouldn't go outside to call me. Really. I mean, of all the jobs in a restaurant- especially when you consider how hard waiters, bussers, and cooks get slammed so hard they can't even take a 5 minute break during the rush- the job of hostess is literally to write down names on a list, smile and be pretty, call out the names of people on the list, and walk 10 feet with the diner and say \"enjoy your meal\", but she couldn't be pressed to have to step 4 feet away from her post to open the front door and call out my name. Anyway, when she started with the whining I just gave her a blank stare which could have said \"the energy you are expending into complaining is literally more than it would take to just let me know my table is ready\" with a mix of \"your job could easily be replaced by a app.\" Now I know why waiters almost always hate the hostesses, but play nice with them because they usually want to sleep with them too, which stereotypically is not a difficult task either. But I digress...\n\nEither way, good hostess or bad, don't miss a Mano before it becomes swamped and the waits become intolerable!", "author": "Matt L."}

I think that makes a big difference. It does not excuse bad food, but food that is good/not great, which pretty much describes A Mano, tastes much better when a person feels welcome.\n\nHe recommended a cocktail \"like a mimosa\", actually a little less sweet. I had it with olives. I had planned, reading menu on line, to order beets but two diners near me had the cauliflower and it looked so good I ordered that as appetizer. It was good as it looked. The waiter recommended a special, fried chicken with polenta and two fried eggs. The chicken was piping hot and generous portions, good flavor. Polenta too bland. Eggs were eggs. I'd say good, not great, but more than edible.\n\nThey don't list desserts on line so I thought I might have to walk to the nearby ice cream parlor, but helpful waiter brought me a dessert menu.

Small/moderate portion size. \n\nAlso importantly: we were able to be seated immediately (at a side table, however) on a Friday night at 8:30!\n\nWe also got the fontina arancini, which is a few pieces of cheesy bread with an olive dip. The bread was quite moist and buttery, and the olive dip was good but salty; overall, nothing to write home about but still enjoyable.\n\nWhile the food gets 5 stars from me, the cocktails were pretty good but not excellent. There are plenty of gin selections in their cocktails. I recommend the Wallbanger, which is fruity and minty but not overwhelmingly so - great for the summertime. The Spritz was refreshing and not too sweet.

They have an excellent walking distance from the Civic Center venues, so it sounds like a romantic stroll off to dinner before or after a show, right? Keep in mind they don't currently offer reservations, so you'll likely have to wait a while to get seated. \n\nAtmosphere and service: \na Mano has a surprisingly large footprint in the Hayes Valley corridor, the length of the restaurant receiving floor-to-ceiling window light. We arrived for an earlier dinner so we had a really nice evening glow for most of the meal. \n\nYou're greeted by a very tidy bar upon entry, a somewhat absurd quantity of surplus ap\u00e9rtifs fill the shelves above the regular drinking options. Grab a seat here if you can after your name is put down, my friends have gone more recently than I have and the wait has been ~1 hour each time.\n\nThe seating is very social and close-quarters, very welcome with the style and vibe of the menu. Our server was very kind and gave us some nice introductions to the pasta making and ingredients, not too pitchy though (much appreciated). \n\nThe meal:\nWe each got the Agnolotti dal plin, the portion was a bit on the small side but I did enjoy the dish. Flavors were rather subtle but well done, I definitely could have added another appetizer beforehand.\n\nI will say my review took a half-star hit or so because we ended up getting our focaccia after our main course and cocktails. I had assumed by that point that our bread + tapenade just didn't make the order and was ok with it, that sort of threw me off and decided not to get any dessert.\n\nFingers crossed that they open up reservations in the future, the bar is just too quaint to allow for parties waiting to be seated.

By good deal I mean a place with an up-tempo vibe, good service, good food, and all at a good price.  \n\nFirst off, my server (Alexa) knew the menu and steered me away from over ordering.  In fact all of the service staff, whether male or female, seems to be attractive and well-versed in the menu.

Thankfully, the line wasn't horribly long so we were able to get a seat for the first round of dining. The menu looks fantastic and we were excited to try several dishes. \n\nOur first dish was an arugula salad with peaches, hazelnuts, and gorgonzola. This was a delicious and refreshing salad that we all enjoyed. We had high hopes for the rest of the dishes.\n\nThe next dish was the chicken polpettine with spicy tomato sauce. It was a pretty dry and tasteless meatball. There wasn't enough juice from the chicken and the tomato sauce didn't balance out the dryness of the meatball. If you're looking for a fantastic meatball, I highly recommend the meatballs from Seven Hills. Those are the best meatballs I've had yet to date.\n\nNext we had the monterey squid, summer corn, romanesco, and olives. This dish was nice with the sweet corns, but it wasn't terribly exciting. The squid was mediocre at best and slightly overcooked.\n\nIt took a very long time in between the antipasti and the main courses. Our waitress said they want to give us a break to digest our food between the antipasti and main but the wait was far too long and made the flow of the meal awkward.\n\nFor the mains, we got the margherita, tomato, for di latte, and basil pizza as well as the bucatini all' amatriciana, tomato, and pecorino (minus the pancetta). It was decent. If you go to check out the restaurant, I'd recommend it but I wouldn't go back just for the pizza. The dough is a little thicker and chewier than the thin crust. It has a good tomato sauce and the for di latte tastes fresh. The bucatini was underwhelming. It wasn't very exciting and the noodles had an odd hollowness in the middle. It doesn't taste fresh or handmade. It tastes store bought to me.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a bit noisy and the chairs are not the most comfortable.

So in that regard, give this 10 stars so all of you wait in line here.  But truthfully this was an average experience for food.  First off, the wait is humorous...it's not worth 1.5 hours or whatever it usually is.  This is a 30 min wait restaurant at best.  The reason being is that the food is basically a fancy version of something like Delrosa...now I have nothing to complain about for Delarosa, but there's no wait, and it's chill.  Yes the pasta is homemade, but nothing was amazing, esp to warrant the wait.  The apps were fine, the pasta was fine (and per our usual regiment, no desert if the nothing else popped).  The only thing I will say is that the value is solid. So I'd go here only if the wait was nil.  But there are way better places for Italian (see Bellotti).", "author": "A A."}

It is surprising they could not perfect it since Ruggero and Adriano are both Italians.  \nChicken meatballs were too spicy, a little kick is ok but too much it throws off the flavors off the window.\nArancini were dry and one dimensional in flavor.\nCauliflowers and the Gem Lettuce salad were the two better items, but it is hard to messed up with those two.\nThey do not take reservations, which could be a hassle if you do not want to wait for a table; they do not have a place were you can enjoy your drinks while waiting for your reservation. Having some form of booking system it would improve their customer service.\n\nLolinda is by far still their most consistent and well done product they have in their company.\nOpen one more of those, 3 Delarosa are enough for now... and open it on Divisadero spot you are about to take over, I live a few blocks away :)", "author": "Gabe M."}

When we put our names down, we were told the wait to be seated would be one hour-- no big deal, as Hayes Valley has a ton of little, albeit expensive, boutiques to wander through. Anyway, a Mano is a nice relief from the pricey offerings of the surrounding shops-- our entire meal for two clocked in at a cool $55 and we were rather happy. We ordered the chanterelle mushroom conserva with ricotta and grilled bread, funghi pizza (caramelized onions, escarole, rosemary, scarmoza), chestnut campanelle (brussells sprouts, chestnuts, celery root crema, and the bucatini all' amatriciana (sans pancetta, as we are vegetarian). \n\nWe'd say that the portions sizes, at least for the pasta, skew slightly smaller than other plates in the city-- but they are also cheaper. We didn't love either pasta. The bucatini probably needed the pancetta for extra salt and flavor-- it tasted pretty unremarkable as we had it. One of our party loved the campanelle, but didn't have the oh-my-god-I-could-eat-this-all-day reaction that we've had elsewhere. Our server did mention that the stuffed pasta option is usually vegetarian-- it just so happened that they didn't have it on the menu. The pizza was delicious-- loved the crust, but again, nothing about it stood out. \n\nWould we come back? Sure, if we were in the area. But if we were craving pasta and had some lead time?

Texture of the handmade pasta made it great.  Huge difference between store bought and hand made for sure.\n\nPasta - Rigatoni, pork sugo - First bite in was definitely salty, but I think once everything mellowed a bit and you get a few more bites in, you appreciate that balanced with the meat sauce.

Very patient as my Sommelier companion questioned him about the bottle list. (Wine was on point!)\n\nApps of olives, cauliflower and duck liver. The cauliflower was insane! Perfect brown on the outside, excellent level of crunch, not over seasoned. Iwould go back for this dish alone.\n\nPastas: bucatini, agnolotti, and pesto tagliatelle. SO DELISH!!!!! The bucatini seriously rivals Tosca's (which is my 2nd fave behind La Ciccia's bottarga). \n\nThe wine was approachable priced, the service was on point but not intrusive, the space has an awesome vibe (way to go, Hannah!). Of course, this restaurant group KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK!!\n\nso why only 3 stars? \n\nTonight, we scurried out of the opera bc we wanted to cap the night with round 2 of pasta! \n\nWe walked in at 10:53 (I was watching the clock bc I know we are the jerks walking in right when staff wants to start shutting down). The host (cute man bun, by the way), told us that they were closed. In an effort to show we would be super quick, I said \"even for 2 plates of bucatini and a bottle of Negro Amaro?!\" (Insert smiling-please-I-want-pasta-face). Negative. He was not very empathetic. So we left. It was 10:55!\n\nAm I going to go back? Sure. Will I tell everyone this story? Yes. Will it really negatively impact the business? Probs not. But if your hours are 11pm, why don't you seat until 11pm? Change your hours to 10:45 and I won't get annoyed the next time I'm turned away. \n\nI think your operation, or at least the MOD that night and your door, should take a cue from the server we had last night in terms of hospitality.

We waited about an hour for a table, which wasn't a big deal because they have a system where they text you when your table is ready, so we just hung around the area.\n\nThe food started out well - we had a spring salad and a pizza, and the house wine was affordable and decent.\n\nHowever, when it came to pastas there were several major issues:\n1. I asked before I ordered which pastas can be done without garlic because garlic causes severe digestive issues for me. They told me all but one would be fine, so I ordered the clam pasta without garlic.   Unfortunately I ate a bunch of the pasta before noticing there was garlic in it (I actually found a piece to show them).  I spent last night not sleeping as a result.\n2. They brought 3 out of 5 pasta out way before the others, so our group couldn't eat at the same time\n3. Two of my friends pastas came out cold and had to be redone", "author": "Yin L."}

She wanted to order the agnolotti because of how good it was when she ordered it a few months ago. Upon trying it, my mouth wasn't satisfied by the taste at all. For a $16ish dish, you except to find yourself going in for another bit but instead I found myself regretting spending that much on a whatever less than okay dish. It turns out they changed the dish for the specific season or something along the lines but it wasn't good so they should change it back. Our server was also a bit passive aggressive imo. I could tell he was fed up serving our table because we asked more than a few questions. The 2 Stars is for the Nutella ice cream and the mushroom dish which was both pretty good. In conclusion...would I come back? No. Too many other places in San Fran that has good consistent food and better service so byeeee A Mano. Thanks but no thanks.", "author": "Nina T."}

I couldn't decide between two dishes and she perfectly described them both to me. I ended up loving what I ordered, it was much better than your average pasta. The ambience was nice. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we were still a little hungry after eating our pasta dishes. I guess I am accustomed to leaving an Italian meal stuffed and their dishes are a little smaller. We both are pretty big eaters, so that could be a factor, but I would make sure to get an appetizer if I went back. But this place really is great and I would recommend it.

The pizza margherita I got was wonderfully flavored and crispy. \n\nThe service was five star, and the lady was both attentive and helpful.

Initially walked up at 5:30 and they said it'd be a 30 mn wait for table of two. My boyfriend and I didn't want to eat that early, so decided to get a drink nearby. We returned at 6:45, and the same hostess told us 45 mn wait. a Mano uses a text message system to alert you of tables, which was great. \n\nWe were seated at a high communal table- at the end, which was nice. I would not have enjoyed getting seated in the middle of the communal table. We had the carafe of red wine - basic table wine, but well priced.\n\nWe started with the squid and argula salad with beets and gorgonzola. The squid was well done - not over cooked, and came with gigante beans that were thick and creamy.\n\nThe argula salad with beet and gorgonzola was so-so-  nothing to write home about. The beets had a bit of vinegar flavor, but not bold enough to be decisive about the intent. \n\nWe split the torchetti, lamb sausage,broccoli di ciccio pasta with the salsiccia pizza. The pasta came out first and was delicious. The lamb sausage was well seasoned, and the pasta noodles well cooked. It was hard to stop eating - but knew we had the pizza coming.\n\nThe saliccia pizza was good, but not astounding. It was what I expected - no surprises, positive or negative.\n\nA bit hard to hear each other - lots of volume in the restaurant, and our waiter, although friendly, wasn't incredibly attentive. He seemed very busy and there was an air of entitlement by the waitstaff across the board - the restaurant is very popular, which they realize. \n\nI'd definitely go back, but focus on what they do best- pasta. The salad and the pizza weren't standout and on their own wouldn't warrant a return trip. \n\nFinally, the pricing was fantastic - so often you overpay in SF, and this was really well priced. Pay attention to the decor while you're there too.\n\nDidn't save any room for dessert - hard to pace yourself with that many carbs.", "author": "Mary K."}

So initial hack: get to Hayes Valley early and before you grab a drink at one of the amazing bars in the area, put your name down for a table. It might not even be ready by the time you finish two drinks. \nThe restaurant is great - very spacious, huge windows. I shared the fontina arancini ($11) as an antipasti with my friends -  fried rice balls stuffed cheese. My friends were obsessed with them. While they did have a great sauce, they were mainly just good because they were fried rice balls stuffed with cheese. \nI also got the bucatini ($14), which I saw a lot of reviews recommend.

We got the pesto pasta which was very light but you could smell the pesto. The clam pasta was good as well. Both pasta dishes allowed us to really appreciate the noodles, which were cooked perfectly. They were perfectly chewy. I even took the leftover pastas home and reheated them and the noodles were still chewy. The noodles were also not oversalted, which is very refreshing because most places are way too salty. The appetizers were not too big nor too small. The mission fig, proscuitto crostini is nothing to really write home about but a good basic starter. We were able to get the soft shell crab salad and that was delicious. The dressing went really well with the perfectly fried soft shell. The monterey squid was amazing though. It came on a bed on corn (I love corn). You could take a bite of the squid, pepper and corn and its like amazing in your mouth. They were not stingy with the squid or the corn.

We got there before the dinner rush (about 5:15) which was great, we were seated right away.  The line was long by the time we left.  We split 2 different pizzas, the summer squash, stracciatella, vidalia onion, lemon ($16) and the salsiccia, chili sausage, tomato, provolone picante, olives, red onion ($15).  Would definitely go back, the food was great.  In fact, our pizza looked so good, another customer decided to order one to-go after her pasta and salad dinner.  Glad we tried it!", "author": "Carolyn K."}

It's pretty good but didn't blow either of us away. We got the summer squash pizza. It was definitely the best thing we got (the lemon was a nice added twist) but with so many amazing choices in the city (like the pizza at Zero Zero!!)  I wouldn't go back for it. We also got the bucatini pasta which I give a solid \"C\" grade. Regular sauce, nothing special. Overall the meal wasn't  very memorable. The drinks were great. Service was just ok - had to flag the waiter several times for more water, red pepper flakes, salt, the check, etc.", "author": "Gabrielle A."}

The wait definitely would have been long otherwise, this spot is super popular.

Service was warm and the food was tasty!  Food wise - Duck liver mousse is my go-to, the porchetta was delicious, as was the tripe pasta and the bronzini.  The drinks, the Rossini, Wallbanger and the Sirena were winners.  I would be skipping the agnolotti pasta next time as I found it to be a bit underwhelming.  When the restaurant officially opened, I put my name down and was told there was a 15-20 minute wait.  After 20+mins and with no text, I came back around and then was asked to be seated within 30 seconds.  I wonder if I would've been texted that my seat was ready if I hadn't been there physically to remind the host I was waiting?  Either way, I look forward to the heated patio seating (how will that be maneuvered?? haha) and trying the pizza the next time I'm in.\n\nP.S.

We had read over-the-top reviews and had been really anxious to try this place, but the overall experience did not live up to the hype.  The best dish was my order, the Tuesday night special braised short rib, which was perfect and delicious, melt-in-your mouth.  My friend ordered the orecchiette pasta with clams and broccoli, and it was pretty much flavorless; the menu said it was supposed to come with chili flakes, but maybe the kitchen forget to add them?  For dessert we shared an excellent panna cotta with pieces of mandarin orange.  I ordered an Americano from the bar; it was spoiled by flat soda with no fizz and not enough ice, so that what ice there was melted too rapidly.  My friend's Rossini was better.  Service was just OK, the main problem being that our server seemed to be responsible for too many tables.  Once things were ordered, they came fairly quickly from the kitchen.  The real turn-off for us was the incredible loud noise level in this place - deafening - and management seems to like it that way.  When the place started clearing out and wasn't so noisy with people, they cranked the music up even louder to be sure we would have to continue to shout at each other across the table.  Why does every new restaurant want to be this way?  If we ever go back, we will hold out for one of the outdoor tables on the sidewalk - it will be much easier to talk over the traffic on Hayes Street than over the din inside the restaurant.", "author": "Stewart C."}

I put 3 of us on the wait list last night around 8:00 - they estimated that the wait would be around 1 3/4 hours.  After 2, hours we gave up and went to Monsieur Benjamin.   The service is far better at Monsieur Benjamin. Also be prepared for a fairly brusk and rude hostess desk.  Their attitude is \"We're busy!\"   I tried again tonight.  They said it will around 45 minutes. We will see - already been an hour.  1 1/2 hours and they offered a communal table - off to Monsieur Benjamin now tonight too!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-16", "description": "The food was delicious (5 stars) and the server was great (5 stars) (pleasant, attentive, and informative). The hostesses were challenging and inconsistently applied their policy of only seating complete parties. They insisted that everyone in our party (of two) be there before they would seat one of us. Before we sat down, we saw an incomplete party had been seated and was waiting for her +1. Apparently, it had been 10 minutes and the guest told the hostess their +1 was a minute away. Then, while we were eating dinner, we observed yet another person waiting at his table for his +1 to arrive. It was about 15 minutes before the other person showed up. If you're not going to take reservations (in a performance district when some guests are undoubtedly trying to dine and get to a performance on time) and tell some people they can't be seated until the party is complete, the policy needs to be applied consistently across the board. We'd love to go back again, but the attitude of the hostesses left us with a really bad taste. They also told us another policy was not to take reservations because they want to be a neighborhood place. \n\nAt least one other restaurant in the area requires a credit card deposit, which is completely reasonable in a district where people are attempting to manage a business and the neighbors or performance-goers make or change plans at the last minute.  Without a reservation policy and an attitude adjustment by the host/eses, we're unlikely to go back.", "author": "Ellen B."}

I liked the pasta too, but the pizza was a favorite. Josh, the bartender was fantastic and we pretty much went with what he suggested for drinks.

So we decided to go again and the 2nd visit was not quite as good as our first. The server was inattentive, forgot to bring our ordered drinks and had to be reminded, didn't clean up any crumbs or spills on our table when we were ready for dessert, and only gave 2 dessert menus when there were 4 of us dining. We decided to pass up on dessert because of that. The margherita pizza was like eating cardboard (if I ever ate cardboard), thin unappetizing sauce, very little mozzarella cheese and basil was haphazardly strewn about. The Salciccia pizza we also ordered was better although a bit on the salty side. The home made pasta is not bad but nothing to rave about. Probably would go back again if there are no other options elsewhere but if they want to retain loyal customers they need to pay more attention to their service.", "author": "TJ W."}
