I was sauntering over to the Galleria looking for a late lunch when I noticed this place on the third floor with all the other fair-to-middling eateries. All of them appeared to be closing up shop at a bit past 2PM. I give the staff here credit for not shooing me away hungry, disgruntled and actually getting a sandwich at Jimmy John's, owned by a right-wing conservative who enjoys killing animals on safari like a certain dentist we all revile.\n\nThankfully I did not have to compromise myself politically and was able to order here or so I thought. Perhaps I should have played it safe and got a $4.99 BLT or even a $5.99 Reuben off the grill. However, I was in the mood for a hot lunch and threw my dice on the table to order their $8.19 Hot Entree with Salad, Veggie and Bread. That day, it was a Grilled Pork Chop, but the grill was already shut off for cleaning. So they took a cooked Pork Chop out of the fridge and nuked it along with a serving of mixed zucchini, yellow squash and carrots.\n\nThe vegetables weren't terrible, but that pork chop was dry to the bone with a slathering of sauteed mushrooms and onions making no-never-mind of the plate. No bread or salad either, just some congealed brown rice they forgot to nuke with the chop (photo: http://bit.ly/1Iq8c2p). Does this look good to you? Then you would have enjoyed the commissary at San Quentin. At least you get Jell-o there unless I'm remembering the wrong Jimmy Cagney movie. They didn't have microwave ovens back then.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...I wish they would have just said they had no hot food instead of serving something my mom would have made on one of her off days\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...diner set-up in the Galleria, no big whoop\nSERVICE - 2 stars...ditto my comment about the food\nTOTAL - 2 stars...stick with the sammies, less risk there", "author": "Ed U."}

My defaults are the salad wraps though. The grilled chicken Cesar salad wrap with a spinach tortilla is typically the first choice although I've had the chicken apple salad wrap fairly often too. Both are under $6. It's quick, cheap, and just the right amount of food for workday lunch. As a bonus, they take cards  which makes it faster and more convenient. Not everything's a hit though.

My homegirl Rita I. raved about the Mushroom and Swiss Burger she had at Fountain, so we went in for lunch today to catch up with our former co-worker.\n\nThe place is very clean, but stiflingly warm! Put some fans in there, guys. It's not even that warm out today and I was starting to glisten in my cotton tee. Anywho, my friend ordered the Fish and Chips, which, upon eating, said it tasted like \"nothing\", hmm. Rita I. got the Tuna Melt with fries which looked good and she liked it, and I had the Reuben with fries.\n\nNot a great sandwich, but it was edible I suppose. I picked it up and water / oil dripped all over my plate, and continued dripping until I put the sandwich on top of some napkins. It was a freakin' waterfall! I know that microwaved meat when I taste it, also you have to drain the water off the plate so the customer doesn't think about the prep mode. I used to work in restaurants, I know the tricks. I was literally gnawing at the meat. Maybe it was old, but it was near impossible to take a single bite without full pieces falling onto my plate. And all that pulling out of meat caused the soggy light rye bread to crumble in hand.\n\nI'm all for the benefit of the doubt, and my fries and pickle were excellent, so I may go back to try a burger.

This one is long overdue and I hope I can make up for lost time.\nThe Fountain Caf\u00e9 is really quite an excellent lunch place. They have their fairly large standard menu of typical sandwiches, salad, soup and grill foods including hamburgers and grilled cheese. Also there is a good salad bar and a specials bar. Overall the widest menu of any place I know about. I like quality & variety, so this place suits me. I usually get the #7 sandwich (chicken, bacon, avocado,) off the main menu and toast it at my office (but they will toast the bread for you if you want.) They put a lot of stuff on it (mustard, mayo, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, onions) so be sure to tailor it to what you want. The sandwich is perfect and the bacon is truly excellent. $6.50 plus tax, one of the best deals anywhere downtown. But the real reason I'm writing today is because for the past two days I've had a particular specials bar offering. The specials rotate daily and has such things as Chicken or pork Collette, pork ribs, chicken Parmesan or Piccata, Lasagna or penne Bolognese, and many others. I think the full menu is about 25 items, with about 10 out on any given day. What I've had there the last 2 days is truly excellent and I have passed on it many times. I will probably never make that mistake again. It was the baked salmon. It was as good as any salmon I've ever had anywhere. I am talking as good as $35 salmon plates I've had at the finest restos in the city. The reason I've never ordered it before? You know that crappy salmon that is dry as a bone on the inside that you typically get at a caf\u00e9? I hate that with a passion. It is like eating slightly damp, warm  newspaper. But yesterday, it looked inviting, and I needed to eat something lower in calories, and with the 2 slices of lemon on top it looked great. So I took the chance. Best. Decision. Ever. The salmon was bowl-me-over good! Just perfectly moist inside, just a little crisp on the outside. The lemon provides a perfect tartness to it when you poke it a bit to release the juice. The salmon is simply prepared, just a hint of salt maybe. Now comes the best part: With your specials entr\u00e9e you get a decent sized side (Caesar, spaghetti, mashed potatoes, or veggies [mostly squash]) AND bread for --- $9.05 including tax. You are out the door with a tremendous piece of salmon, salad and bread. Try to find that anywhere in S.F. I dare ya.", "author": "Jeff S."}

Unfortunately, I don't work downtown anymore, and every time I've been by during my shopping hours they are closed.  Their salad bar is delicious as well, but it's easy to go overboard and find yourself with a 50# salad.  Yikes.  Their other entrees are hit or miss, sometimes it's a delicious meal, sometimes it's only ok.  I've never had any terrible meals here though.\n\nHowever, there are some problems.  First off, I've obliquely mentioned their hours, which I've never bothered to actually figure out, but I assume they are only open for business day lunchtime.  Then there is their ordering system, which is complete chaos.  I have no idea how they have never screwed up my order, but I have seen several people get theirs messed up.  It's also above average price wise, so it's no bargain lunch.\n\nA side bonus to ordering here is being able to take your lunch up to the roof of the Crocker Galleria and eat in relative peace.  It's rarely crowded, and usually sunny up there, so it's a nice lunch break from a busy day.", "author": "Gusty S."}

These are the only two redeeming qualities of this establishment.\n\nI got one of the 'the specials' today - poached salmon with mashed potatoes and salad.  It was a lot of food for $7.50, but none of it was any good.  The salmon was dry and cold, mashed potatoes were mealy and tasteless, and caesar salad was soggy and drenched in dressing.  \n\nI was lucky enough to get some fruit salad which was also soggy and not particularly fresh.  Besides, the fruit salad and the caesar salad in my to-go box became more than friends very quickly.  Have you ever had a piece of honeydew covered in parmesan cheese and caesar dressing?  Yum!

Take that Assqew.\n\nMy classmates and I were waiting around the top of the escalators at the Crocker Galleria, being a general nuisance and fire hazard.  Unable to wait any longer (it wasn't getting any hotter after all), I dug in to the take-away container of gooey-ness.  At least 4 grown up people oogled my dish with pleasant surprise and asked me if that was mac and cheese in the tone usually reserved for, \"Is that really a Prada bag on sale for 90% off?\"  I felt quite smug and self satisfied with my choice of nourishment and the lunch world around this BART station opened up a little more.  \n\nThe other offerings on the menu were at very decent prices and I saw the portions they offered.  It was decent.  Very decent.  Not obesity-generous but not the usual yuppie salad bar nouveau cuisine of \"Good Omens\"  It was enough for grown men to have a satisfying meal without the burden of having leftovers to take home or the angst of throwing perfectly good food away.  \n\nI'll be back to try their grilled sandwiches.  When the temperature takes a nose-dive and the weather is on the rag, nothing warms that void where my heart should be like a grilled sandwich with turkey and sprouts. \n\nDid I mention that half a roast chicken was only going to cost $4.50?

I checked out the menu and the price as well as their Grille and their well stocked salad bar.  If I was still in the work force, this place would be a \"habit\" for me.  The burgers looked delish, but I settled for their Fish n' Chip ($6.50).    I like my fish batter to be coated with flour, milk and eggs (like Picadilly Fish n' Chip).  The batter was a bread type so it was tasty but I like crispy to the max.  As one reviewer wrote the Fries was tops ($1.75 if you don't order an entree special with it).

They offer 3 types of lettuce, green/red peppers, cheeses, pumpkin seeds/almonds, chicken, tuna, onions, chickpeas/kidneybeans, corn, peas, and the list goes on. In addition, they have an extension to their salad bar that has at least 15+ dressings in all different flavours and offered in low fat/full fat forms. \n\nAt around 6 dollars a pound the salad adds up depending on what you put in it, but it's cheaper than most in the area.", "author": "Florence T."}

I have tried two different sandwiches now and they were both good. They have a wide variety of lunch items such as: cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, salad bar, breakfast items, and hot lunch. The lady next to me last time that I went had the french toast and it smelled really good! Maybe I'll try it next time...", "author": "Carly W."}

I love sandwich's and there #9- Turkey, Avocado, Cream Cheese & Sprouts sounded very tasty. The sandwich plus a can of soda was under $8, which was what I wanted to pay, and the sandwich was as good as I was hoping for. The only downside is that the Galleria can get pretty crowded during the lunch hours and finding a seat can be a pain- but I'll most definitely be returning to Fountain!", "author": "vanessa g."}

Great lunch spot, fabulous salad bar (they ran out of croutons once, that makes me sad but it hasn't happened since--and they have a really good creamy caeser dressing) they have cool daily specials that are adequate comfort food fare: ribs, macaroni & cheese, mashed potatoes, roasted chicken, lasagna. They have a decent chili (even better if you stock up on the free crackers at the condiment bar--and don't forget to pile on the cheese!). They have yummy grilled cheese sandwiches (served with a pickle slice--bonus!) and they do breakfast too! They have okay burgers and fish & chips. Not the best but they won't make you sick or anything. For a burger I prefer to spend a bit more and walk the extra 2 blocks to Bistro Burger. I have to thank Fountain Cafe, though, for being my go-to spot for lunch when I can't make up my mind and don't want to be let down. If you're one of those people who HAS to take their lunch right at 12:00 PM on the dot, then call in your order. This place is an absolute zoo during the weekday lunch rush. The employees handle it well, though, or else I would never have the patience. Thanks for being competent, people. So appreciated.", "author": "Magi C."}
