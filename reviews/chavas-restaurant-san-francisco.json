We used to come in for breakfast every weekend with my husband and son. It was our weekend family breakfast spot. \nIt was our time to get out, give me a break from cooking and spending quality time discussing what we did during the week and just enjoying each other's company type of place. We would always sit in the back in the corner for a more intimate feel.\nI would always order the menudo or chilaquiles and they would order either chorizo con huevos or chilaquiles. \nThis time my son and I visited and I ordered the menudo and my son ordered chorizo con huevos. I had my coffee and my son had horchata. They gave us a basket of chips and some salsa. The salsa was perfect and spicy! My fave!\nWe enjoyed our food very much and reminisced. We had a great time and service was awesome! You are able to watch the cook make the food. If you want authentic Mexican food then this is the place to go! \nEnjoy!", "author": "Jennifer C."}

This time there was no choice to have the meat separated from the broth so we ordered it as a soup. It was a big bowl and the broth was much better than Gallardos.

I guess I should finally tell how good this place is. I have eaten at MANY taquerias and Mexican restaurants throughout SF, most upon recommendations of other friends and co-workers, but this is the only place I recommend for Mexican food in the Mission district. Years ago this place would be crowded for lunch, and as another reviewer noted, the lunch crowds of late number well under a dozen diners at any one moment. I recall this downturn after that last economy crash, and perhaps it was unrelated (other restaurants opening up nearby?), but the quality and service is as great as ever. I forever have had the lluevos rancheros, and without disappointment, but because they finally added burritos (which they originally did not have - not inexcusable as burritos, as we know, are an American invention!), and now I am hooked on the vegetarian burrito. I get it \"mojado\" (red source on outside, with some cheese and other goodness added) and for just $8 I can eat my fill!  Chips and a little salsa (less amount than in years past, though . . . ) on the side for free. Good selection of drinks, refrescas and such to help the meal go well. The ambiance is great, and reminds me of many places I've eaten in Mexico itself. Nice wall paintings (large!) also make this place a little unique from other places. They still make tortillas by hand (they used to crank them out for the crowds so had an almost full-time lady working that station), and service staff are delightful, accommodating and friendly as can be, even to any first-timers. So do yourself a favor and give it a shot . . . I think you'll enjoy it as much as I do !!\n(It is cash only, though, but they have an ATM nearby if you don't notice that announcement)", "author": "Mark K."}

With the endless choices, we always seem to come down to the same four places - El Farolito, La Corneta, Taqueria Cancun and El Zocalo. That's why it was a bit of a stretch for us psychologically to consider going to Chava's on the next block from El Farolito. We came here early Sunday afternoon, and it was quite packed with families feasting after going to church services.\n\nWe were about to leave until the zaftig hostess cleared a side table just for us. Chips and salsa immediately came to our table (see photo), and we could tell they were freshly made in the kitchen. Always a good sign. There was a lot on the menu, although it looked from the other tables that the most popular menu items were big bowls of soup. But as usual, we didn't follow the norm. Jamie went into his comfort zone and ordered the $7 Super Nachos with Beef, which were fine but really didn't stand out on their own (see photo).\n\nI decided to take advantage of the weekend-only availability of goat. Yes, goat... so I ordered the $10.75 Birria al Horno con Arroz y Frijoles (Goat with Rice and Beans). Accompanied by their steaming hot, housemade flour tortillas, the goat was quite savory with a consistency similar to pot roast. Before I finished my second self-service soft goat taco, the waitress delighted me with a huge bowl of Birria (see photo). What a treat. I immediately put all the remaining goat and rice in the hearty broth. Really delicious. The soup is definitely worth a return visit.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the birria is definitely the standout here - and get the goat if you're here on the weekend\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...looks like pretty much like every other formica-dominated Mexican Mission eatery\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...bonus points for giving me the complimentary soup\nTOTAL - 4 stars...best to eat here on a brisk day, livestock optional", "author": "Ed U."}

So of course, it's not too long after I move to San Francisco that my craving for Tex-Mex starts kicking in and I find myself literally spending hours searching for a good place. Disclaimer: I've been told that there's a pretty big difference between real Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine so I'm going to specify that I'm writing about Tex-Mex.\n\nI searched high and low for a place that serves fajitas and finally found Chava's. Here are my thoughts about my experience in order of occurrence.\n\nIt's located in a semi sketchy part of Mission. Don't think I'm going to get hurt or anything, but definitely not the cleanest. That's Mission district for ya I guess.\n\nCash only sign - good thing I had some paper on me. Usually not a super big fan of places that only take cash. Come on, it's 2015, time to upgrade.\n\nHOLY MOLY FREE GUACAMOLE! Normally, places charge $1 for guac, but it came with the complementary chips and salsa. Easily earned some major points for this place. Salsa was pretty good too!\n\nThe fajitas didn't come on a sizzling plate like I'm used to in Texas, but they were pretty good none the less. I ordered charro beans instead of refried - mistake. The charro beans were incredibly bland, sticking with the fried fat next time.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan.

Side wise it was almost exactly the same as the other restaurants, but the flavor had much more depth than the other chicken burritos I tried. Their chicken is stewed in a red sauce for hours until it has taken in all of the spices in the pot, no matter how subtle. It's then mixed with a very soft white rice and refried beans, then rolled tightly into a burrito. Served alongside a handful of chips and a semi-spicy green jalape\u00f1o salsa.

If you haven't been here & had that- do it now. Do it for me.\n\n I lived on Potrero Hill for over a decade back before the Mission was prime real estate & first started going to this place when it was a hole in the wall over on,uh, 19? There was a fire. Thank god they resurrected on the Mission. \n\nThey are  the Chiliquies of my dreams. A plate of these with cold beer will easily fix the hangovers of two deeply damaged people. Strong armed ladies behind the counter make their own tortillas BY HAND, for the love of god. And although I know, it's called \"Migas\" in Texas, these chiliquiles feature eggs/a HUGE side of carbs/ lots of cheez & crema swimming in a perfect greasy sauce. Amazing.\n\n I'm making myself home sick.... sigh.  Maybe they don't make their tortillas by hand anymore? Maybe they changed the sauce? Maybe it's as different as the Mission is these days. I don't know- but I will make a pilgrimage here next time I visit the bay. \n\nWon't you please go find out? I'm sure you won't be sorry.\n\n( I wonder if they put out calendars?

I so badly wanted to be there so much that I spent the morning feeling sad and felt like crying.\n\nI'm just going to say it. With sincere apologies to San Diego, Chicago and LA El Paso is home to the very best Mexican food in the United States of America. Certainly it's proximity to Juarez is a huge help (which by the way, is worth checking out for yet another culinary adventure).\n\nBut I can't be in two (in this case 3) places at once. But with El Paso on my mind and up early on NYE I craved Mexican. The Mission is not El Paso, but in my most humble of opinions, it's very close and there are some dishes that you can find here that are almost equally as good. One example of this are the chilaquiles at Chava's. \n\nThis dish is the most comforting breakfast food you can find in the entire neighborhood. Soft warm corn tortillas made by the hands of angels, tossed and pan fried with a deep rojo (or verde) sauce with eggs and your choice of meat, pork or chicken (veggies too!). This dish will wipe out that you hunger for quality Mexican food that you so covet. Chilaquiles will warm your soul and will make you feel like you have found yourself in a small friendly village in central Mexico surrounded by some of the friendliest people who open their hearts and treat you like family.\n\nFor those of us living in the 'burbs, it's worth the drive. And given that Monday is a semi-holiday, the drive was a breeze and finding parking at 8:00 could not have been easier. The service was so fast that I was back home in plenty of time to catch the opening kickoff (which again was only another heartbreaker). \n\nHappy New Year.", "author": "V B."}

It left me wondering if they prepared a large pot on Saturday, left it simmering all day, and then reheated it again on Sunday. \n\nThis time I tried the birria en caldo. The broth was very flavorsome, but the meat content was somewhat skimpy compared to competing restaurants in the area.

We went ahead and ordered the Queso Fundido  with Chorizo (about $8), the Birria de Chivo (about $11), and the super burrito de pollo ($6). \n\nThe queso fundido (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hkqph_Rn9-_4TzGNJLIpzw?select=57rZocNnMKCK_HM66VK9Ng) came out first with some homemade tortillas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hkqph_Rn9-_4TzGNJLIpzw?select=-54DQbQE3vxhArpL6L6otw). It was so cheesy, melty and delicious and the chorizo set it off perfectly. I found myself mixing in some of the serranos from the table and, whaaaaammmmyyy! Awesome, fattening, greasy dish. The wifey's burrito was pretty weak. Still not into the whole beans and rice in the burrito thing and the chicken was just okay. That being said, we knew that she ordered wrong beforehand and would have went to Farolito up the street for a real burrito. But, we came here and mostly because I wanted some birria. This version was one of the better ones that I have had. It was more of a soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hkqph_Rn9-_4TzGNJLIpzw?select=uugbWG8LgKoV-iMckRAiWA) than a stew like some places serve it and was huge! The broth was a little thinner, which made it easy to eat, but still had plenty of spice and flavor to it. I added some more serrano's, but that's just because i like it to hurt a little. It was piping hot, so the chilies, onions, and cilantro cooked right in. The goat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hkqph_Rn9-_4TzGNJLIpzw?select=kvprNcSgrVOtpok5Lzp5Kg) was so tender that it was falling off the (amazingly) few bones in the bowl. They must have been keeping all of the bones in the pot for flavor because goats are some boney creatures.

For those who don't know, pozole is a chile-based soup with pork and hominy.  Add tons of chopped onions, cilantro and lime to enhance the hearty soup.  Typically, pig's feet are also used in pozole, which can deter some people from eating it, but growing up in a very Chinese household, pig's feet are no foreign object to me.\n\nChava's $8.25 bowl of pozole is gigantic and can leave your bladder on the verge of bursting.  It's chock full of meat, pig's feet, and hominy.  Every spoonful is loaded with goodies.  Although the soup is a bright hue of red, it's not too spicy either.\n\nWe also tried their carnitas platter, which didn't do it for us.

Giant chunks of chicken (bone-in), potatoes, carrots and other goodies. Then on the side, they bring you bowls of rice, onions, chilis and cillantro, so that you can add them to whatever degree you want. (And I want a lot.) It's just so good. Sometimes the jukebox will be playing, and that's a plus. The staff has always been very nice, even though I can't always communicate with them that well with the language differences. Long-timers will remember the original Chava's several blocks away that burned down. Boy... that place was just crazy, with how tightly-packed the tables were and the murky lighting. I did like how they had outdoor seating though. This location used to be another Taqueria San Jose (like the one which is now still across the street), but once Chava's burned down, they ended up taking over this location... so there must be a connection between the restaurant owners or something. (As an aside, my favorite cheap steak tacos, outside of a taco truck, are at Taqueria San Jose.) So anyways -- I'd highly recommend trying this place out. If it's a nice day, get one of the tables by an open window, order the soup and a beer, and sit there and people-watch as you enjoy your delicious and incredibly filling meal.\r\nps: I added a pic of the soup to the Chava's description.", "author": "Zoe H."}

It was the weekend before el dia de los muertos, and I had a hankering for some mole.  I had only had mole once before almost ten years ago, but even w/out a recent basis for comparison, I must say that I was pleased.  \r\n\r\nThe next time I had the fried tilapia, and was not put off by the grease.  Yesterday I took my parents there, and my dad had this wonderful plate of fajitas, and my mom had some yummy beef tacos.  I had the grilled fish which was also good.  This is not the best food I have ever had, but it may be the best Mexican food I've ever had in a restaurant.  \r\n\r\nA note on the atmosphere: Whenever I go there alone I like to sit at the counter and watch the ladies behind the glass make some of their fabulous tortillas.  Otherwise you can sit at the tables and take in the Diego Rivera-style murals.  Oh, and I love to stare at the waitresses.  A couple of them favor bizarrely frosted hair and jeans so tight you wonder how they keep up their bumble-bee bustle when it's really busy.

Please don't come to Chava's expecting the best burrito in the world, because you will not find it and you will begin to cry, and no one wants that.\n\nThe reason to come to Chava's is their soups.

The heartbreak of the fire that destroyed the original location felt like the loss of a good friend and a delightful \"locals\" tradition. Chava's was a place where Mexican families enjoyed a big Sunday morning breakfast right next to hipsters, gay couples, and the usual melange of working class humanity in The Mission. We felt like fools when our breakfasts arrived, because as it turns out we had very wrongly assumed that the quality would be compromised by the change of venue. The only things lost in the move were the friendly forced intimacy of the communal tables and frankly, some of the dinginess. The new location is much cleaner and brighter, and the food is exactly the same, which is a compliment. I ordered the oversized Caldo de Pollo and my friend had his favorite chilequiles. Both fantastic, served with fresh garnishes and salsas. I had forgotten how delicious Chava's fresh tortillas were. Good enough to munch alone without filling or salsa. We couldn't finish our huge meal, which came in at about twenty dollars for both. \"Free,\" joked my well-fed pal.
