My date wanted to meet in the Mission District, and Mosto immediately came to mind! It's in walking distance to BART and two Muni bus lines, so travel was very easy.\n\nMosto has a great selection of affordable drinks, including local beer, wine, and cocktails. Although I've had their amazing cocktails, including the very delicious Paloma (with mezcal), that particular night I got a pint of the Henhouse pale ale and then a pinto of Modelo Especial. I also love the food and had to get the al pastor tacos--a Mosto must and never disappoints.\n\nWith dark walls and candlelight, the space feels intimate. The music and bustle of people (many friend groups and other people on dates) liven the bar. This place is hip without being pretentious, and I often come here by myself just to eat tacos and drink beer. Happy Hour is everyday from 5-7PM. You'll thank me later.", "author": "Joanna S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-02", "description": "This place is a total joke. Chipotle is better. To begin with, they serve tomato sauce with basil and try to pass it off as salsa. Taco bell has spicier sauce packets and possibly spicier ketchup packets. I asked if they had anything any spicier. They brought a tray with 4 metal cups one with chipotle chiles and a haba\u00f1ero sauce. Again, no spice. Thinking it was just me my German husband tried it with the same reaction! It could have at least have been flavorful but again, no dice. I ask again for a spicier salsa and I was handed a bottle of Tapatio. I was happy to finally be able to add some flavor to the flavorless \"carne asada\" I was given on a street taco size tortilla for $5. The carnitas were bland and lackluster. Even the quacamol\u00e9 & chips were disappointing. How do you screw up those two? The only advantage was the guacamol\u00e9 was fresh. Congratulations, you got smashed avocados with salt and lime correct, Mr Head Chef. I would assume your last job was working for Chipotle except they know how to make salsa.\n\nThe drinks are expensive and again low on flavor. Instead of calling the restaurant a Spanish word like \"Mosto\" which means \"must\" they should change the name to \"No lo hagas\" which roughly translates to \"Don't do it\" to warn those of us who have had good Mexican food in the Mission to just avoid this over-priced, underflavored lie of a restaurant. \n\nAvoid at all costs, unless you like spending a grip of money on food you could have ruined at home on your own. Do yourself a favor and go a restaurant that looks like a dump and could possibly have roaches in the Mission. They will know how to make flavorful food that will satisfy you. Yeah, Mosto, I would rather risk a food born illness than waste my money at your restaurant again. The Mexican people who work there should be embarassed at serving such mediocre food. \n\nAt least do a better job of cultural appropriation, Mosto owners. I think I can get better Mexican food in Germany.", "author": "Megan D."}

Music was not recognizable, but all of my friends and I were a fan of the music choices and pretty much Shazam'ed the whole night away.  Seems like you can order things from the Tacolicious menu (right next door) but we only looked at the drinks.  \n\nCan I first just say that the mezcal menu is HUGE (think 6+ pages)?  It's a shame that you only get the mezcal menu upon request, because I think this is the highlight of this bar.  The servers are huge fans of mezcal and will walk you through this menu and answer any questions you have for the curious mind on mescal (from how it is made to different styles to stupid questions on difference between mezcal and tequila).  \n\nWe were aided by Christian Arizmendi, who was very knowledgeable on mescal and gave us 3 different ones to try (one smoky, one fruity, and one more herbal and vegetable tasting).  He sat down at the table with us with the three bottles and explained the differences between the mezcals he brought.  He even served us one for free, a mezcal de pechuga, which included goat meat drippings.  \n\nAnother cute thing here is that the ceiling is lined with glass jars and you can leave messages (almost like a time capsule) in them upon request (no charge).  My three friends and I did this when we went last time.\n\nMy advice when you come here: order mezcal; not tequila or any familiar cocktail you usually order, but MEZCAL.  Come in with an open mind and pick the waiter's brain a bit and explore the world of mezcal.  Even if you don't like the drink, like me, you at least will walk away impressed by how knowledgeable the staff is on mezcal.", "author": "Audrey H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-30", "description": "The spin-off side bar of Tacolicious.  Same building, just separated by a wall and a convenient door.  Tacolicious always intrigued me.  Gentrified tacos dead smack in the middle of the Mish.  It works, what can I say, people friggin' love it.  Me?  I have mixed feelings for it.  The plus is the atmo.  Peeps love to party and have a good time here.  Can't really do that at a legit divey taqueria down the street.\n\nMosto is 90% bar.  A small makeshift taco station services the bar, with maybe a half dozen offerings.  Great when indulging in their massive tequila selection, which is also featured in all of their signature cocktails.\n\nCocktails pretty legit but pricey.  $12 fiddy starts.  Margaritas use good tequilas but also use agave syrup and lime instead of a sweet/sour mix.  It is softer but lacks that acidic punch most associate with margaritas.  I can't stand commercial sweet/sour mixes, so this was fine for me, but not as good as Fiesta Del Mar's version where they use their \"own\" mix, using key limes.\n\nLa Paloma is usually a blanco mixed with Squirt and is conducive to the hot towns in Jalisco.  Here they up it with St. Germaine and grapefruit instead.  I also took sips off a chile infused cocktail and that got my brow to raise, in a good way.  Bartenders pretty good here.\n\nMunch-wise the tacos are not bad.  At $2.50 for tiny two biters, the value can be questioned, especially in a taqueria rich neighborhood.  But in their defense, they are good.  Tortillas just barely warmed through.  You don't get the full choice of meats here, maybe only 2-3.  But what you give up in choices, you'll get fresh off the griddle freshness.  Pastor just ok, just get the one down the street for under 2 bucks.  What is hella buck here, are their Nopales con Queso tacos.  Strips of cactus on top of griddled Oaxacan cheese.  OMG good, trust.\n\nTamales are skipable due to the masa being overly wet/mushy.  It taste fine, especially the poblano con queso, but the masa is strange.  Their Hamburgesa however is the thing to get if a little hungrier.  It's a basic griddled burger but with Oaxacan cheese and pickled onions.  And for 8 bucks, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one out here in SF, at that price point.\n\nAll in all, not a bad spot to haphazardly stumble upon.  Clean, stylish, quaint yet solid.  I mucho recommendo.", "author": "D.wight L."}

Seven short weeks, but in that short amount of time so much has changed that I felt obligated to write a new review to keep my readers and eaters up-to-date.\n\nSeven weeks ago I gave this glorious restaurant a 5 paw review. I don't do that very often as to me 5 paws are saved for the best of the best. Mosto was the best of the best, but something happened and they have fallen hard.\n\nPicture it, 5:20 p.m. on a Monday night. Not a busy time, or day of the week. I patted my furry feet into Mosto and took one of the high top tables. There were perhaps eight other people in the restaurant/bar. In other words, it was not crowded.\n\nMy order was simple, a margarita, a cactus taco, an al pastor taco, and a pastrami taco, nothing crazy or difficult. About fifteen minutes later I'm informed that another tables order was put on my bill and so they needed to sit down with me to determine what I had ordered and what on the bill wasn't mine. There were even a couple of tacos that no one seemed to have ordered on my bill. So after a round of discussions, I received the food that I had ordered.\n\nI have to say that the pastrami taco was still as I remembered it. Nothing on my plate even resembled the wonderful food I had just a few short weeks ago. The cheese on the cactus taco was over cooked, brown, and crunchy. When I bit into the al pastor taco, my immediate thought was that the pork had been sitting out in the sun. It was completely dried out, and no flavor. We won't even go into the details of what they did to the pastrami taco.\nThis was without a doubt one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a while, not only was the service completely out of whack, but the food was total crap. Not what I expected on my return visit to Mosto. \n\nAlas, that will be my last trip to Mosto.

The tamale with chicken, green beans, and potatoes was ok flavorwise but very mushy in texture ($3).  (Next time would probably hit up El Toro instead.)\n\n7)  M.W.A.

Obviously in the mood for Latin fare--I call it love, others call it a disease. \n\nMy partner and I happen upon Mosto--instantaneous curb appeal: gaping plate glass windows and simple, inviting gray-green earthen facade. Friendly greeting by the hostess, immediately seated at a two-top in the sun. Ambiance perfect so far--expansive mural with scrawled messages opposite us, wooden floorboards, lights strung above. So far, excellent. \n\nCute female hipster servers all about, but none come to our table right away...or within our first 5 minutes of being seated. Minus a few points. Finally, a busboy brings us water, chips and salsa. The chips house-made chips are salty, crunch and fresh. The salsa amazes us--light brown-orange, not your everyday pico- or tomatillo-style offerings.  Slight tang and spice complement the chips well. Points regained.\n\nWhen our server finally arrives we decide on a pitcher of red sangria--a drink we both adore--for $26, which is standard for trendy Hispanic places. Another 5 minutes or so elapses before it arrives, served in a 1 liter carafe. Most of the volume is ice, which is disappointing. The disappointment deepens when the sangria tastes like watered-down kool aid, with barely any alcohol burn or spice notes. Big minus here. $3 Tecate cans are not bad, but I would like to see 21st Amendment cans for $3 or $4--something that is probably not fiscally appropriate in the Mission. Oh well!\n\nWe decide on the tilapia and shrimp ceviche. For $13, the portion is smallish. I think the chef was going for something audacious and interesting, but failed: the dish has nectarines, which is nice, but they are muted by the lime. In fact, the prevailing flavor is not of the seafood nor the nuances of the fruit and vegetable combination, but of the lime juice. The dearth of flavor is definitely not worth the money.\n\nThe decor and vibe of this place is decidedly rad if you enjoy the upscale, hip Mexican scene, which both of us certainly do; however, our experience with the food, albeit small, is a major turn off. Would I return? Probably, if only to hang at the bar or outside with some beer.", "author": "Justin M."}

After reading all of the colorful and complex flavor notes listed, I want to try them all. At around $10 a swig though, I'll have to take my time. The flights are fun, but of all the tequilas I've tried here so far, my favorite is the Espol\u00f3n blanco. To my surprise, it's not very expensive in stores (~$20), so I am excited to stock the ol' wet bar with it. Get ready: one tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor!\n\nThe itty bitty, street-style tacos are much different than the ones served on the Tacolicious restaurant side, but just as t-lish. Though I would happily eat one million of both the bistec and cactus (with burnt cheese!), I usually settle for just a few. Each one is intended to be a bar snack, not a meal - but they will save your life as you're wasting away waiting for a table next door.\n\nAs seems to be the case for most Mission bars these days though, this place is shoulder-to-shoulder CROWDED on the weekends (primarily popped-collared and/or sloppily drunk in stilettos types), so don't even try on a Friday or Saturday night.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

Met up with Randy, Char, Elisa, and A.Lau while coincidentally running into Cat and Jor and their families.\n\n7 dollars for a tequila shot and a tecate? Done deal, especially for a tough day of work  (all of us were having)\n\nWe ordered the 10 tacos special for 31 bucks. 3.10 a taco is pretty pricey for the Mission, but this is more of a fusion place. All tacos come with 3 sauces... spicy (habanero), medium (tamarind i think), and mild (green sauce). All sauces were good, and had different profiles so mix and match.\n\nShort Ribs - these were cooked medium, and were super tender but you'd pretty much gobble up all the meat before even finishing the taco. The only thing that was bad about these were that they were under seasoned.\n\nCarnitas - Surprisingly tender... closer to pulled pork though than carnitas. Not overly salty or crunchy, which was a bit disappointing, but the pulled pork flavor was great.\n\nBeer/Tequila Chicken - amazingly flavorful. Almost like a mole taste to the beer/tequila chicken, but it had this nice sweetness from the beer and tequila. The chicken was ultra tender, and not overly salty.\n\nFish - this gives Nick's a run for its money. While this may be smaller, it is slightly cheaper than Nick's. It has a better batter flavor as well, though Nick's bests Mosto's with the guac and crispy tortilla. \n\nLengua - not one of the specials... but still amazing. Ultra tender cubes of beef tongue (don't worry, they shave off the taste buds), marinated so that it was slightly sweet but more salty. This was amazingly tender, as in yakitori japanese restaurant tender. You cannot get tongue cooked any better than Japanese style or Mosto style. My only gripe was the price tag (5 bucks). However, this is THE BEST lengua taco I've ever had... hands down... sadly its a weekly item only.\n\nChoco Taco - pretty much a fancy choco taco... with the waffle being crispy and flavored similar to a Swedish pancake (vanilla flavored). The ice cream was deliciously creamy and dense (vanilla flavored as well) and the chocolate was dark chocolate. Almost tasted like a fancy Drumstick.\n\nOverall an awesome place, with good deals.

The grilled squid Veracruz are so soft and juicy; the chicken enchilada are pretty good as well. The chip and salsa that they provided are good, the chips are thin which you can just nibble on all night long. \n\nDrinks: Oh.. they have tequila. In fact, the tequila list is bigger than the food menu. I still think Tres Agave has a more comprehensive tequila list, still with just about 100 type of tequila on their list, they gave me another excuse to come down to Mission. Their margaritas are very good, not too sour, definitely recommended. $10 per cocktails and $30 for a small pitch of the same cocktails, as you can see, drinks are not cheap here, and it is where they will make their profit.\n\nDecor: modest, comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is those metal stools. They have a few different spaces. As you come into the main dinning room through the courtyard space, you will see a small bar counter with a much larger open kitchen, high bench sitting along the glass window that open to the courtyard. There is a banquet room pass the bathrooms, and another parallel space to the main room that have a much better bar setup. I like the variety that it provides, also it just means the wait time is less. (I hope)\n\nService: Overall good.

I asked for sangrita to come with my Herradura reposado, and our waitress didn't know what the heck I am talking about. Also the few tables next to the hostess has the most awkward set up, those short metal stools look so uncomfortable. They could easily do a couple of large communal table with bench seating.\n\nBy no mean, this is not a place that their food or drinks will blow your mind away, but they do have a winning combination of being well priced and exactly what I have in mind for a night out in the Mission.\n\nGreat new addition to the Mission casual fine dining scene.", "author": "Alice C."}

We chose to sit outside which on some aesthetic level was interesting with its softly etched mural of San Francisco including bits of inspiring and fragmented prose, long narrow channel flooded with cheap-looking, yet fun modern orange seats tucked under some industrial string lights. Let me belabor the point, that was the best part. \n\nIt took us a while to get greeted. The sangria was a glorified watered down icee with only enough alcohol to laugh at one of my partner's jokes (not okay). We split the ceviche which was just okay. It was bland with no complexity, the bits of nectarine added nothing-- it was overpowered by a wash of  lime juice. The chips and salsa were surprisingly the best part. The chips were perfectly salted and fresh with a golden hue that reminds me of the dried grass on Mt. Tamalpias. The salsa was fresh, tangy and had no chance in hell of staying full.\n\nThe food was overpriced for the quality and the service was slow. They did have a pretty nice tequila list-- expensive but good. So my suggestion would be come get a nice shot of tequila and eat some free chips and salsa.", "author": "Brienne P."}

On NYE I was pleased to find it mellow and not so packed around 11:30pm, we grabbed the four window seats and went on a taco-ordering frenzy. Between the four of us I think we devoured close to 20 of their $1.50 pastor tacos. Tonight (Monday) it was the same vibe at 5pm, got a small table and went loco on 12 tacos. The pastor is really nicely seasoned and served with fresh pineapple..mmm. Their two house salsas are devine, an orange salsa (made with oranges?) is thick, citrus-y and mild and the green jalepeno salsa is killer, vinegar-y and with a bit of a kick. I had the nopale taco as well which said it came with queso, but not enough to comment. It was also very good, slow cooked, nice texture. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered their Agave flight which is a 2oz of tequila, mezcal and sotol each, bartender's selection. ya know. again, we were here for the tacos. \n\nI've had the Mosto house margarita (on the rocks) and the Paloma which is a grapefruit based tequila coctail. Both good, fine...$9, maybe. \n\nThe ambiance is really chill, dim lighting wasn't so good for eating, but it makes everyone look good. I wouldn't try to roll through with a group larger than 4 to this place...if you get there early enough you can snag the 2 large top tables in the back of the bar, otherwise its tiny bar tables with a very narrow bench. Either way, don't get confused, you're here for that Pastor!\n\nside: On NYE we did pop over to Tacolicious which I guess is an independent-ish venue (expanded menu, tacos are $3.95, taquitos for $9 etc), if I were just going out for drinks and a snack or a first time date I'd stick to Mosto.", "author": "Shannon H."}

I did like their food, too--just make sure you take THEIR menu and not the menu from next door. They have separate registers and menus.\n\nThe place seems like a winner if you come at the right time of night, before it gets packed. Once the crowd fills the place up, you really feel the crunch as elbow room becomes a precious commodity. And I'm certainly not one to get in the way of people having a good time with liquor, but you will find it very difficult to eat anything if there or do a tasting if drunk people are bumping into your table or stool as they try to squeeze into the bar.\n\nThere is a TV on the back wall, but I wouldn't recommend this place for a baseball game on a Friday night. The high noise levels and tunnel-design of the bar will make following the action a bit difficult.\n\nNice bar though, I will be going back to do my tequila snob thing.", "author": "Jared S."}

Mosto has potential to be a great spot, but our blonde waitress completely ruined my experience there. I met some friends at Mosto before having dinner nearby and we all ordered a drink and some tacos. After about 20 minutes everyone had gotten their drinks and tacos - I still hadn't gotten my beer. The waitress stopped by and said it was because they had to change the keg (understandable) so I cancelled the beer since we had to leave soon for dinner. Apparently the bartender didn't get the message and still poured the beer a few minutes later - another waitstaff brought it over to me and I told him I cancelled. He said oh ok, well you can still have it. I took the beer - not really even wanting it - and our blonde waitress came over and literally GRABBED the beer out of my hand and said in a horribly rude tone \"you cancelled that.\" Everyone at our table and nearby was pretty shocked by the incident and how loudly she yelled.
