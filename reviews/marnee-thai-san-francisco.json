The drive was too long to wait after a long flight, so we found this spot on Yelp & stopped in. The inside cover of their menu lists all of their awards, ranging from 1993 to this year. Our group of four split satay chicken and spring rolls with dipping sauce. Two of us ordered Thai iced tea, which was new to us. I liked it, but my husband is dairy averse, so it wasn't his thing. It's a sweet, creamy, spicy concoction. \n\nOur food was great-- perfectly spiced, perfect temperature. \n\nThe service was just okay. May have been a language barrier. Hence the four stars. We'd definitely come back.\n\nSharing two appetizers, each with drinks, and our own entrees, it was about $25 per person, including taxes. A great deal. \n\nWe loved the little candies at the end of our meal (pictured, green wrapper). We walked to the closest market at the intersection and found a bag full (they're Guava) for just $1.75. Yay!", "author": "Julie L."}

The chicken satay was very flavorful and had a savory curry-like flavor. We also ordered the angel wings and that was our favorite appetizer we ordered. The angel wings are slightly sweet and not too spicy. The yellow curry for our entree we got was also very good and not too watered down unlike some other Thai restaurants I've been to. \n\nThe only con I'd have for this restaurant is that it feels a little pricy compared to other Thai restaurants, but it's still my favorite place.", "author": "Elaine N."}

I've never ordered something I didn't enjoy, and if I could come here every day, I would. Someone please make my dreams come true.\n\nFAVORITES:\n\nAppetizer\n- Homemade Hot Cakes: YUM!

Sounds like an interesting mix because it is, but IT WORKS and is so so good.\n\nSalad\n- Green Papaya Salad (Som Tum): a perfect example of something so simple, yet so good. \n\nSoup\n- Tom Yum: a spicy and sour soup that just soothes your soul, really.\n\nNoodle:\n- Chan Pad Poo: MY #1. This is essentially a crab pad thai, but better. It's a spicy rice noodle dish with stir-fried crab meat and egg in a chili garlic sauce. I'm currently drooling writing about it. I COULD LIVE OFF THIS STUFF.\n\nCurry:\n- Mussamun Chicken Curry: a southern Thai style curry with chicken and potatoes in coconut milk, but really, all the curries are bomb.\n\nFrom the wok:\n- Pad Kaprow: your choice of meat (I prefer chicken) sauteed with fresh chili, garlic, bell pepper, and Thai basil. THIS THE ONE.\n\nDessert:\nI've tried all of them, and they're all good (surprise), but my top 3 would be:\n\n- Banana & Black Bean Sticky Rice with Coconut Ice Cream\n- Mango with Sticky Rice\n- Roti with Coconut Ice Cream\n\nMarnee Thai delivers, every time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-10", "description": "The stellar standout was the mango sticky rice with the black rice, specifically.  I've never had the black rice prepared like this, and it was done very well - not over cooked, but nicely al dente, which provided a perfect contrast to the soft fleshy sweet mango.  It truly was fabulous, and reason alone for me to return, but probably the only reason.  \n\nMarnee Thai was really a hot restaurant years ago, as exemplified by the wealth of accolades noted on the left side of their menu.  They were one of the early few Thai restaurants around, long before the ethnic food craze began.   However, I think the latest award was received back in 2011 or some time there about.  Unfortunately, the restaurant setting itself is also stuck in a time warp.  \n\nOther dishes we ordered were the green curry (with chicken and additional tofu for $3.00), along with the pad see ew.  Both were fine, but not particularly exceptional in any way.  The noodles of the pad see ew were broken up more than I would've preferred, which makes we wonder how fresh the noodles were to begin with.  If they're super fresh, they don't normally break into such smaller pieces, unless they've been refrigerated.  There were other dishes I saw other people ordering that looked more appealing to me than the ones we ordered, so perhaps it was our bad for not knowing what dishes to get.    \n\nService left a lot to be desired.  We had to ask a couple of times for the rice we ordered, when the other dishes were already served and getting cold.  It wouldn't be proper to have a curry dish without rice, right?\n\nWe've had really superb Thai food in Thailand, so I know how excellent Thai food can really be.  This isn't it. I know... we're not in Thailand either.  Fairly priced meal though.  \n\nLastly, it has been about about 7 hours now since we dined there, and I've been finding myself really thirsty in the last few hours, an after effect that I really don't like.  Just stick with the mango black sticky rice.  No pun intended.", "author": "Lori N."}

I tried the pad see ew and was blown away. The flavors were so different in a good way. There was sweetness in the dish without that artificial taste or feeling like a bunch of sugary sauces were added. (Another time we came here our pad see ew tasted like garlic noodles which threw us off. It was as if they forgot to put some sauces in but we never experienced that problem again when we ordered other times.)\n\n*Service is a little strange here. They get really busy and don't usually have time to check on you which is fine with me but if you need something you'll need to flag a waitress down. One time I wanted a pad see ew with beef and my bf wanted a pad see ew with chicken and she said how bout both chicken cuz it's easier to make. Kind of weird but I also understand since they're busy. Also coming from a very Chinese background, I can relate with employees that try to get things their way. Regardless, food is enough for me to come back. \n\n*Portions are pretty big and prices are decent too.", "author": "Sarah W."}

Nothing special but I thought it was still good. Next time I want to try their usual egg rolls. \n\nPad thai with chicken -- 5/5\nExcellent execution on a classic dish.

Very flavorful, fresh, what pad see ew should be. Note that Marnee Thai's version used regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli, which was a slight copout, but didn't detract from the flavors.\n\nI'll say that the entrees were all a tad more garlic-y than typical Thai, but I'm not mad about it at all.", "author": "Rebecca X."}

They use strong spices and flavoring in their food, which is absolutely fantastic. I tried the som tum and tom kha gai and they were both amazing. You'll be in for an explosion of Thai seasoning and flavors in your mouth. I'd say order a side of white rice because the dishes are extremely flavorful.\n\nThe two dishes I tried were also extremely sour, so watch out if you can't take sour foods. I use lots of lime/lemon in many of my foods, so I definitely enjoy the sour taste. With that being said, even these dishes felt a bit more sour than I could handle without some other starch on less sour dish on the side. But I do enjoy the taste so. I unfortunately did not order any rice the day I went, but definitely would next time I come here. And you can bet I will come back.\n\nOne thing I'd want for the dishes is for them to be more spicy or have the option for us to order levels of spiciness. There was barely any spiciness to the dishes I had. At least a chili pepper on the side so I can chow on would be great.\n\nThe interior is quite cute; it's like you're inside some Thailand hut. I don't like the lighting, though. It's extremely dim, which makes the place seem dreary. It's a small space, but it wasn't too crowded when I came here for dinner.

The Pad Thai and salad were like any normal one I've eaten, so nothing special. \nI think that the waitress that served us was really trying to get us out of the restaurant because she would come to our table and grab our dishes when we weren't ready, and gave us our bill before we asked. \nMy friend told me how one time she went they were very patient and kind, so I would try this place again to see if they were any different!", "author": "Linda N."}

Last week when a friend and I came in for lunch right at opening. First off the giant oil truck came late and we had to be part of them taking out a huge vat of frying oil from the kitchen straight through the restaurant next to our table and out the door as we were trying to order. The stench and flies were horrible. I know it wasn't their fault the truck came late- but still. The worst part of this experience was our waitress (older short bangs lady) was making the tea or something similar with fresh lemons in the kitchen walkway ( see photo) and as she was mixing it with the chopsticks she was licking them tasting to see if it was sweet enough and then putting it back in the pitcher to adjust the taste! I was disgusted. I can't believe it and now I have to find another place for lunch. I mean come on!! \nWe told the younger gal as we were finished with our meal ( of course that's when we witnessed this) she seemed indifferent . Well ... no more lunches for us.

I had the noodle dish that comes with fresh crab and it was super delicious! The egg was done to perfection and overall flavor balance was good, with maybe a touch too much of the fish sauce but otherwise nice blend and plenty spicy.\n\nThe tap waters were terrible, couldn't even bring them near our noses, so strong was the chemical smell. And unbelievably, no bottled water. I had a tea but it also had the same chemical undertones of the unserviceable tap water.\n\nThe maim issue is how cramped the restaurant is. It's hard to believe that this isn't a fire hazard. The waiting staff are constantly bumping into diners because there is not enough space for them to move freely between tables. So when the orders of the table next to you are being taken, you'll be bumped or at the very least have to pause your conversation until their orders are taken.\n\nHusband didn't like his massaman chicken curry at all, nor the duck fried rice which he said was so fatty he couldn't eat the duck. We didn't even take it home with us, we just left it. Mine however was plenty enough for 2 portions, hence it will be lunch tomorrow! He said it was way too noisy, claustrophobic and with constantly getting bumped by waiting staff and other diners, this was not a good experience for him. \n\nProbably won't ever be in this specific area ever again but not a lot to draw us back anyway.

I came here around 5:30pm on a Monday evening without a reservation, and almost the entire restaurant was empty. I was seated immediately. Service was quick and our waters were refilled often. I ordered the beef pad thai ($12.95), and it was probably one of the better pad thais that I have had recently. The peanut flavor was strong, but not too strong, and there was a nice balance between sweet and savory.

As I mentioned above, their peanut sauce is one of my favorites. I can eat it with anything-chicken, shrimp, beef. When I was getting low on peanut sauce, I asked for more, assuming it was complimentary. However, when I got the bill, I was charged $2.50 for extra peanut sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-07", "description": "When you ask San Francisco residents what they think is the best restaurant for Thai food in the city, many of them will mention Marnee Thai. A good number of my friends and fellow Yelpers have made bold claims that Marnee has the best Pad Thai around. Such hype definitely deserves a visit from my taste buds.\n\nInterestingly, there are two Marnee Thai locations in the same Outer Sunset neighborhood. One is between 23/24th street on Irving and the other is near 9th. I decided to just to go the former since it was closer to where we were.\n\nWe came around 1230 pm on a Sunday and the place was half-filled. No wait at all despite the hype (it's on the Michelin recommended list)! Right when you walk in, you immediately notice that you have been transported to Thailand. The bamboo walls, the music, and the low-ceiling make you feel like you are not in one of those generic Thai restaurants that don't have the right atmosphere. \n\nThe menu is quite standard for a Thai restaurant, but I found that they had more traditional dishes you won't find in every place nowadays (I think they are actually known as a Siamese restaurant). My girlfriend and I weren't too hungry and so we got one chicken Tom Yum soup and Pad Thai to share.\n\n-Pad Thai (10/10). I know Pad Thai, so basic to order right? Not every restaurant can make good Pad Thai and I believe Marnee Thai hits the mark. It was flavorful, sauce was not overwhelming, and noodles were chewy. Portion sizes were average for around $12 each dish but the quality was there. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had but it's up there.\n\n-Tom Yum (10/10). Though serving size for Tom Yum soup looked kind of small, we were able to get around 6-8 bowls between us. That's not too bad considering you are paying around $10 for this. The Tom Yum tasted very authentic, was soothing, and filled with chicken.\n\nWould I say Marnee Thai is the best Thai restaurant I have ever had? Probably not, since it depends on how you view each item. The atmosphere, however, was amazing and we felt like we were stuffed after a sub $30 meal. But would I come again? HECK YES!\n\nTl;dr good place, great atmosphere, much delicious.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Entrees will run you about $10-13 which is an awesome deal and makes me want to come to the Sunset for more Asian cuisine. You'll find that this is a much better deal than the pricier Thai places closer to downtown and the heart of the city.\n\nI was feeling pretty basic so we ordered a lot of dishes on the more typical end, like pad thai and pad kaprow. For the more common and standard options, Marnee does a pretty great job. I'm not into spicy food myself, and the chefs catered really well to making the food mild. Definitely ask to up the spiciness if you're into that though. \n\nI noticed that service was very friendly and attentive and left a positive impression on me. The portions are just the right amount to fill you up, not too much and not too little. Between a group of around 4 people, we shared 4 dishes and there was plenty to go around. The food came rather quickly.\n\nTom Kha Gai - Refreshingly warming soup. Has a great tangy spiciness and flavor to it. Would recommend.\n\nPad Thai - Just the right balance of sweetness. Comes with huge portions of peeled shrimp, I thought this was a nice touch. \n\nYellow Curry - Curry consistency is more watery rather than thick if you're into that. Do wish there were more veggies mixed in. The chunks of potato were a bit too large, the chicken was a bit skimpy and on the dry end and felt odd having peas in the entree. \n\nPad Kaprow - I'm not a meat person so didn't try it, but the group I came with really enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, left very satisfied and happy with the food choices! Service and quality of the food for the prices made this experience particularly special to me compared to other Thai restaurants in SF.", "author": "Chelsea W."}

That was fine, we just got boba at iTea and headed over after that. We were directed to the back of the restaurant where the rest of the pickup people were waiting. After another 20 minutes waiting, we finally got our food at 8:45 pm.

We ordered pad thai, chan pad poo, angel wings, and an avocado prawn salad (my favorite!).

Also while we were eating near the front, she started yelling to the other waitresses in the back. Like how rude is that? \nFood was (4/5) \nService was (0/5).", "author": "Jacky G."}

We came in on the dot but a few people were running late(common). We were told that we couldn't be seated because we were not full party yet. The weather that day was freezing and we asked if there is an exception for us to be seated first. The answer is no. The waiter didn't care about us, and the restaurant wasn't even half full by that time. \n\nAfter a bit of trying to reason with the waiter, we were seated. We decided go with some appetizers and wait for other people. The appetizers were 3/5 but they missed one of our order, which was reasonable based on the amount we ordered. We wanted to wait for the last person to show up before we order the main course. (Basic manner) a lady, seemingly the owner, came to take order. We asked if we can wait a little because the last person was on the way. She refused and was yelling at us. We were forced to order dishes, and she was forcing to choose some dishes. What kind of restaurant server yells at their guests and forces the guest to pick the kind of food. Very bad customer service(although she was nice to other guest).\n\nOverall, the restaurant servers were very disrespectful, period.

A little cozy place with friendly staff, sometimes they will come up to you and randomly strike up a conversation. Parking can get difficult to find during the weekends but if you go around the block a few times you'll find something. \n\nOne of my favs from this place is their angel wings, duck fried rice and their pad ka prow (your choice of meat stir fried with basil). I thought the angel wings was really good. You have your deep fried chicken wings coated in batter and then tossed in their angel wings sauce. The sauce is sweet and spicy but not too much of a kick. The duck fried rice comes with chunks of very well seasoned roasted duck, pineapples, tomatoes and sliced cucumbers. To me the flavor is just right. Not too salty or not too bland. For the pad ka prow, I prefer the pork ka prow over the chicken. Again its also well seasoned but over the times i've visited the taste has been a little inconsistent (in terms of saltiness) but its not that its bad or anything. \n\nI also tried thier tea leaf salad, pad kee mao, and banana curry but I wasn't a big fan of those dishes. The tea leaf salad was okay, pretty typical, but crunchy really good peanuts. Pad kee mao wasn't special but its not bad. Lastly I thought that thier banana curry was a little weird. Not sure if it was just me not used to eating banana in a savory dish, but the banana tasted weird and was a little hard. \n\nI would come back here if im craving for thai food!", "author": "Valerie H."}

But.. no. It's honestly not the worse I've had. It was just okay. \n\nI will point out the things I liked though.\n\nI will say do order the Tom Ka. It's very fragrant in the most pleasant way. It's the lemony I've had: a lot of lemon leaves definitely. I liked, the flavors were great. If anything order that.\n\nTheir thai tea was great.. not bitter.\n\nThe next two things aren't 'special', but they're pretty good, not shabby..\n\nThe pad thai was on the saltier side from other pad thai(s) I've had, but I loved it actually. I thought it was super flavorful. I usually avoid ordering it at most places even though I do like pad thai.. so I'm glad my little bro always want it.\n\nThe Thai Style Fried Rice with the roasted duck was pretty good, even better the next day as leftovers..\n\nThings maybe to not order depending on what you like: \n\nPanang Beef. My go-to is for curry is any curry, but my favorite hands-down is always panang. So I was very disappointed. It was not thick, more on the watery side. But, the beef was really good on it's own. It was like chunks you find in Chinese beef stew (sorry, I'm bad at meat cut references). My brother thought this was worse than the beef dish he ordered, but I have to disagree.. Both beef dishes were super salty..\n\nHe ordered the green curry beef. There was something in it that didn't sit right with me.. I think it was the spices. (I don't see it on their ordering menu online.. though). It was just a weird fragrant taste in my mouth. \n\nThere were two other dishes and I didn't love them.. one was better than the other, but I don't know what they're called, but if I saw the actual menu, I could point it out. But it was a lot of fish sauce.. I can stand the smell of fish sauce, but taste in it was just overwhelming. And fish sauce is the main component of every dish my mom makes so.. I don't know. \n\nMy dad liked it though out of all us which was a surprise. He said it alright and that's a compliment coming from him.

One positive is that my food was delivered fast. As far as the food goes, here are my thoughts:\n\nImperial Rolls ($8.25): Includes 3 rolls with a side of sweet chili sauce for dipping. The rolls are deep fried with ground chicken, prawns, cabbage, mushroom, and bean thread noodles. Tasted like egg rolls. Nice crunch on the outside. \n\nPad Thai ($11.95): I ordered pad thai with chicken (they also include pieces of tofu in the dish). The portion size was very generous. Noodles were cooked well but the dish was a little bland in my opinion. Might need to order it spicy next time for an extra kick.\n\nMussamun Chicken Curry ($13.95): Unfortunately this was my least favorite dish. The chicken was all dark meat (I didn't know that, and prefer white meat). And the curry was pretty runny, similar to a ramen broth. I am used to thai curries being thicker and rich but this was the opposite. The flavor was also a little bland in my opinion.\n\nOverall the prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food for what you pay for. Delivery of the food was fast.

I was really glad that I got Thai tea because it was exactly what was needed to cool my mouth down.

Next time, I'll definitely think more ahead of time before I order anything too spicy. Hopefully I'll conquer the heat in my next go around.

When it arrived at the table it was barely warm and appeared to have been sitting around. It was very mushy and unappetizing and after one bite, remained uneaten. Next, they brought a large bowl of rice over that we had not ordered so I told the waiter it must be for another table. Shortly after, the woman who had pushed the mushy fish, (I think she is the owner) came over and seemed surprised we didn't want the rice. Apparently it wasn't an accident that we were served it. Last, when the bill came, we were charged for 1.5 soups. We questioned the owner about the charge and she said we were four people, so we had been brought and charged for soup for four. We pointed out that we had specifically ordered a small soup, which said it served 3 people, as only 3 people were eating soup. She did not offer to adjust the bill and at that point we were happy to just leave. I felt ripped off and will definitely not return again!

My friends and I decided to give Marnee Thai a try. \n\nParking: We went to the Inner Sunset location, and there was a lot of street parking in the area. \n\nSpace: It is a small space and not ideal for groups bigger than 4. Tables are placed closely to each other, so you are extremely close to your fellow foodies. \n\nService: The woman who served us was rude to us; she took the order quickly. We asked to get water and extra bowls multiple times before we got them. The food came out slow, but this is because the restaurant was packed when we ate. \n\nOrder: \n1) Pad Thai, $11.95: This was full of flavor. However, it didn't seem like it had been in the wok for long, as I could the flavor was not fully absorbed in the noodles. \n\n2) Spicy Angel Wings, $8.75: This was recommended to us; however, I was disappointed in the wings.

If you have had wings at San Tung, this is no comparison. \n\n3) Tom Yum w/ Chicken, $9.95: This was my favorite dish, and I have not complaints about this. \n\nVerdict: 3 because I have had better Thai food in Seattle.

Good enough Thai food that I will gladly order something other than Pad Thai or Pad See Ew & Mr. Joy orders something other than green curry. This year marks their 30th year anniversary. One of the few times someone looks forward to 30.\n\nFrom the outside, I wouldn't expect the entire place to be covered in what looks like the bamboo mats that my grandparents sleep on. The hanging plants and stringed lights sort of give it an island feel. It's a tight space and the tables are situated very close together. The angled bamboo sheets of the faux vaulted ceiling actually makes the place feel even more claustrophobic. \n\nThere always seems to be a long line around peak times. Apparently you can call to make a reservation. The 9th Ave location is similar, but doesn't feel as claustrophobic.\n\nThai Iced Tea ($2.75): \nvery sweet. The condensed milk covers about 1/3 of the glass. The tea flavor reveals itself more as an aftertaste\n\nSpicy Angel Wings ($8.50) - deep fried chicken wings sauteed in chili-garlic sauce, topped with crispy basil:\nYes they're good. Crunchy, sweet, & spicy, like a lot of Asian-style fried chicken wings. My favorite part is the crunchy basil.\n\nThai Style Potstickers ($7.95) - pork & vegetable stuffed potstickers served with spicy green curry sauce:\npretty good potstickers with a decent crunch, topped with shredded basil leaves, curry sauce adds some flavor\n\nKang Dang/Red Curry ($13.50) - medium spicy curry with coconut milk, bamboo shoot, Thai basil. Roasted duck with pineapple, tomatoes, bell peppers:\nThe flavor of the curry was delicious and pretty mild. It seems like the amount of coconut milk they use really mellows out the red to an almost yellow curry. Duck was really good too. The pineapples added a lot of sweetness. The large tomato wedges seemed a little out of place though. The dish was topped with a little white sauce that looked like creme fraiche(?).\n\nPanang Beef ($12.95) - beef with panang curry paste, coconut milk and Thai basil, with broccoli:\nBeef cubes were nice and tender and had good flavor.\n\n*Rice costs extra. Rice doesn't come with your meal or with the curry dishes. To me, rice & curry is like bread & butter. Curry needs a carb, just like butter needs bread. You probably wouldn't want to eat straight up curry or butter on its own.\nA side of rice is about $2 per person. Some restaurants charge for rice. I prefer the ones that don't.\n\nIt's been a while since I've seen the owner, who had a ... colorful personality. \n\nOverall: good food, prices are a little high for this area, atmosphere is unique.

When we walked into this restaurant, the waiter just asked us how many people and then went straight to the back/kitchen area without coming back for a while. Especially that we notice there was a an empty tables that can be seated for 3 tables. It was until an older lady came out (possibly the owner) and told us that someone already made reservation for the bigger tables. And the give us a ready tidy table for 3 people. \n\nAnyways, we were looking at the menu to see what we want to eat for dinner. Took a while until someone came to us to get our order since it was busy. The owner came to our table get our order. She was pretty loud but funny. She was the only person getting the orders for each other while other workers just bring out food. \n\nThese are the foods that i tried:\nHomemade hotcake(this dish came out really quick since the owner was yelling to the worker or just shouting out for this dish). Only had to wait couple minutes while the other dishes we had to wait a while. This dish was really good and yummy. It has that sweetness flavor. It came out really hot since it was in a hot pan looking thing. It was bite size (almost like bagel pizza but a little smaller) \n\nHot & sour soup: thought it was good. It had that tangy taste flavor.\n\nPad thai with chicken(this was my main course while my bro and cousin had their own dish). Pad thai is always good no matter where you go.

Papaya Salad, Satay, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Tom Yum, multi-colored curries etc\nThe Verdict: Unexciting and boring after years of repeated indulgence!\n\nThe foregoing is of course an awful and unfair judgment as I do recognize their popularity with the masses. While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so. This is a magnificent Thai seafood soup with sweet and sour overtones. In Marnee's rendition, the fragrant broth was the best part and the taste stemmed from the judicious use of ginger and lemon grass. The broth could be made mild or fiery depending upon your heat preference and stuffed with a good variety of fish and shellfish. I remembered imbibing this soup sold by a street vendor in Bangkok, with the heat factor being a double whammy... the heat from the soup (spiciness) and the heat from the scorching weather. But it was nevertheless gratifying, bordering on a self-inflicted masochistic perversion and a very sweaty forehead! (4/5)\n\nBeing a seafood lover, a fish dish seemed like a good idea. Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all. There were 3 different prep methods and the basa fillet topped with the spicy mushroom in curry sauce and coconut milk was our unanimous choice. We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance. Let me just describe it as a glorified hole-in-the-wall with a minimalist aesthetic approach. The bamboo panel on the left wall added some Thai flavor to the d\u00e9cor and the rest of the wall was adorned with some kitschy Thai artifacts. Tables and chairs were packed in like sardines although the white linen and table top orchids did lend a small touch of class. Service was pretty ho hum throughout our entire meal and we felt neglected especially since we were the only other table at 4pm.", "author": "Geoff G."}

Find your favorites and you'll be compelled to re-order them many times. (BBQ chicken and Thai Fried Rice with a side of Cucumber Salad.)

When I first came in for an early dinner on a Friday night with friends, it smelled like wet dog in here. I was hesitant to stay to eat, but at that point I was just so damn hungry that I didn't care if there was potentially any mildew in my food.\n\nGood thing that Marnee only went up from there, and eventually the stench went away (no clue if whether it was the restaurant's fault or not in the first place, I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt). Marnee has a big menu with a lot of vegetarian options. I got to try both the vegetarian pad thai and the tofu pumpkin curry and both were a total blessing. Back in the Castro Valley area I had been enduring disappointment after disappointment in trying to track down good Thai food, but Marnee was my light at the end of the tunnel! Everything was well cooked, well presented, and *so* flavorful. My only complaint would be that service was a bit on the slow side.\n\nIf you're in the area and looking for some good Thai food, give Marnee a try!

Waiteress came over to take our order and my friend was in the middle of telling her what he wants, and the waiteress decided to ignore my friend and talk across the restaurant to a coworker about something I can't understand because she was talking in Thai. After she was done, she did not apologize for being rude. She finished her converstaion, turned around to our table and did not say a single thing. The entire table was silent for a second because we were all shocked at how rude she was, and was expecting some kind of apology, or at least for her to say something..anything but she just stood there so we continued placing our order. \n\nMy other friend was placing her order and said she wants her dish without eggs and garlic, and the waiteress said \"ohh..you shouldn't be this picky.\" Are you serious?! I'd understand if this place specified that customizing your dish is discouraged due to the small kitchen and it'll delay food coming out (some places do that and I'm okay with it) but this place did not. \n\nMarnee Thai, yes you have 1000+ reviews, but with customer services like that, people will not be coming back. I won't be.\n\nFor me, a place can offer okay food and have amazing customer service and I'd want to come back because I want to support the business and the people behind it. But if a place offer amazing food, but bad customer service that'll ruin the entire dinning experience for me.

Their popular dish is the Angel Wings and we order that every time we come dine here. We also like the Crab Pad Thai or Crab Fried Rice, which isn't on the menu but you can ask them to make it. Both dishes are very tasty. The curry dishes are also good. The papaya salad and the mango salad are all very good. Customer services is great. The owner is very friendly and likes to come around to chat with her customers. The waitress and waiter dress in traditional Thai clothing. The interior has many Thailand decoration, so you really feel like you are dining in Thailand. However dining here with a large group can be a problem because the restaurant is small, so it is really hard to accommodate large parties. So I suggest coming here with smaller group of only 5-6 people. The wait time for dinner can be around 30 minutes since the place is small. So best time to go there for dinner will be before 6pm to beat the crowd.

I love their chili sauce! The tom yum was flavorful and comforting. What I look for in a soup! I love green curry and this satisfied my craving. And of course, the roommate always gets pad thai and pad kaprow. Those are actually his two favorite dishes. The only thing he didn't really care for was the texture of the chopped chicken.

Soggy? They used rice noodle, but I was expecting it to be a little more dryer and flavorful. But alone it was bland. I practically dumped all my curry onto it hoping that it would give it some flavor but it didn't. It just made the noodles extremely more hotter (hahaha) but really it did. \n\nMango fried rice: I liked the fried rice, it was savory meets sweet in my mouth.

Well, I was informed by an Uber driver recently that the BEST place to go for Asian and Indian food was the Sunset district. Chinatown for Chinese food? He laughed in our faces! Don't be fooled, he said, you won't want to walk into half of the places, but they will offer you the best food out there. Wise words, indeed. \n\nI happened to be near Golden Gate park and was craving some Thai food so I walked over to Marnee Thai. I wasn't starving, per say, so I kept it light. I ordered the chicken wing appetizer along with the avocado salad as an entree. The chicken wings didn't specify whether they were spicy or not and I love me some spice so I requested a few extra chiles be thrown on there. They were more sweet than spicy, but good wings nonetheless. The avocado salad was great and left me feeling satisfied. The salad included lettuce, cashews, prawns, avocado (by the motherload), mango, and some sort of sweet dressing. I'm not sure what was in the dressing, but I would recommend getting it on the side as they drowned my poor salad in it. \n\nOn another note, service was rather slow, but it is what it is. The waitress/hostess were very helpful. \n\nWould I check this out again?

Most places offer the same generic Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, or Yellow Curry for a reasonable price. \n\nI must say that for a little bit extra cash, Marnee Thai sure delivers the quality and taste. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the Mango Fried Rice, Angel Wings, and Pad Kaprow. I'd agree with other reviews that the Angel Wings are reminiscent of the chicken wings from San Tung, but the Angel Wings are more saucy. Therefore, in this comparison, I'd still have to prefer San Tung, but these Angel Wings come close. \n\nSurprisingly, the rest of the meal including the Mango Fried Rice and Pad Kaprow were delicious. The Pad Kaprow had just the right amount of spicy kick that wasn't overpowering, but still conveyed a savory flavor of the pork. The Mango Fried Rice was also a beautifully savory dish, with a nice sweet touch with the Mango. I think if there were more Mango slices and were cut in smaller cubes, I believe it would have made the dish supreme.\n\nThe service was a more \"home/mom-pop\" atmosphere on the Sunday evening I dined at MT. There were a lot of huge parties and that resulted in the waiters/tresses screaming in Thai to one another about the next orders, seats, and drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-19", "description": "I think this is possibly my favourite Thai restaurant now! \n\nRarely have I entered a restaurant where the aroma of the dishes permeate the air and entice you to order everything on the menu. Please note that this is *very* different from those poorly ventilated restaurants where the dining area is stuffy and filled with smells and fumes that makes one wonder if one is sitting in the kitchen instead.\n\nThis time, I have to admit, their usually amazing Thai BBQ Chicken was a little less than sublime; but it was still good. I believe it might have spent a little more time than it should have on the counter, tapping it's finger, waiting for a server to \"take her away.\"\n\nI loved their green chicken curry. It is obvious that the meats and the vegetables have been simmering in the sauce for a good while, judging by how flavourful they were; many a times and oft have I eaten numerous green curries where the wonderful flavours manifests themselves only in the sauce, but nowhere else.\n\nThe stir fried chicken with bamboo-shoot (I forget the name, but it was #30 on the menu) made for a wonderful contrast to the curry. I have lost count of the number of times when two different dishes taste all too similar; especially when it comes to the coconut based sauce. This was not it. This was sharp, and pungent, with it's own distinctive spicy flavour.\n\nMy only grouse was their servings of steamed rice. The container is so huge, and the rice portions so small, we had to keep asking for more. I wondered if they were bringing in single servings of rice every time, in spite of the fact that there were three of us at the table. Anyway, that's too minor to ruminate over.\n\nBefore I forget, we had something called a \"coconut mini cake\" or some such, it was hot (temperature) and creamy and smooth with a sprinkling of corn on top. It was pretty good. I was rather surprised that the \"angel wings\" were not boneless; I am used to having them boneless and stuffed with meat, vermicelli, and a smattering of nuts. The green-curry pot-stickers were pretty good though it seems the 'green curry' merely meant it was served with the sauce poured on it; I thought the stuffing was going to be a green-curry based meat.\n\nAt $73 (incl tax) for three appetizers, three entrees, couple of drinks, and numerous rice trips, I think this was definitely value-for-money.\n\nI can't wait to go back again (and try their Thai fried rice)!", "author": "Umesh T."}

We ordered 5 items:\n\nTom Yum Shrimp soup                    3/5 stars small portions lots of shrimp normal\n                                                                               everyday run of the mill Tom Yum Soup\nChicken Larb                                     3/5 stars  regular chicken larb didn't wow\nSpecial Satay Wrap                          2/5 stars  just chicken Satay with lettuce leaves\n                                                                               and bean spouts and peanut sauce\nPenang Pork Curry                           5/5 stars  the best dish full of flavor tender pork\nMango Sticky Rice                             4/5 stars nice warm sweet rice dessert.\n\nThe restaurant was busy, and the soup came first. As we were consuming our soup the Chicken Larb came which took up all the space of the small table. So we hurried up and finished up our soup. As the waitress took away the the soup bowls the Satay Wrap came. We asked for chopsticks 3 times with 3 different servers, it was not until the 4th time did they bring them. As we started trying the wraps and the larb the Penang Pork Curry came. Sorry no more room on the tiny table. I commented to the waiter that I had asked for a larger table that remained empty. He proceeded to put another small table next to ours and rearranged all the dishes. Very intrusive that did not have to happen.\n\nFor dessert we had the Mango Sticky Rice. It was good and I could feel that the servers were feeling awkward about having put us a such a tiny table. I am usually some what discreet about taking pics of my food but I wanted them to know this experience would be reviewed. 2.5 stars round up to 3 not worth driving to SF for.", "author": "George F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-21", "description": "I can't believe i haven't reviewed Marnee Thai. I've been coming here for years. I feel like i've commited a sin but taking so long to write a review.  I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations. If you have a big party, i recommend the Irving and 9th location because they have a private room.  No matter which location you go to, the food will not disappoint you!", "author": "Belinda C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-09", "description": "Street parking in the avenues isn't fun at times.  You just have to do it because you rather avoid the meter.  Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.  My focus is the food, and I guarantee they'll dish out some really top notch Thai food.\n\nSmonkey's Tip:  ...I'm still thinking about those SPICY ANGEL WINGS...try them at least once, if not order them again.", "author": "Arnold T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-27", "description": "Only weeks after an interesting discourse with fellow Yelper, John S. I found myself back at Marnee (the topic of our discussion) on Irving, a long-standing favorite.  It was a small, mid-week meal shared by two, consisting of Calamari Salad, Green Vegetable/Tofu Curry, white rice, and tea.  It'd been at least one year since my previous visit to Marnee and many, many years since I'd been a regular patron of the place.  How many?  Ms. Marnee predicted the gender of my oldest son, now 21, when I dined there routinely for years leading up to his birth.  \n\nMarnee was once the standard bearer against which I measured every other Thai restaurant.  When I realized that none approached Marnee's stature I stopped going elsewhere.  What I loved there was what I ordered this time (all of their curries were complexly flavored, rich, and aromatic) plus Miang Kum, Chan Pad Poo (a pad Thai-like dish with sweet crab), and more.  And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but in a way that caused me to imagine I was dining in a bustling little thatched hut in Thailand.  \n\nOn this visit I noticed that the serving dishes had changed.  The Calamari Salad, which once was served on a wide flat plate, was now served in a bowl.  There seemed to be more salad-like ingredients and fewer calamari despite the rise in price.  It was still good though; spicy with complex flavors.  \n\nThe green curry though was a different story entirely.  Again, the price was more (as expected) and the serving dish had changed but these things would have made little difference if it had been excellent, as my sense-memory recalled it.  It was not.  It was warm when it should have been piping hot, watery when it should have been stick-to-the-spoon thick, and lacked the layered flavors it once had.  This is sad: Marnee was once renowned for her complex curries; whoever is making them now is not making them the same as they once were.  \n\nWhich brings me back to this:  The conversation that John S. and I were having on Marnee Thai was regarding the troubles of their second branch, on 9th Avenue (in 2013 they were briefly shuttered by the Health Department for violations).  Could it be that the original location is not keeping ingredients as fresh and clean as they once were?  Or could it be that there's just a different chef executing recipes differently and not as well as they once were?  I'll never know.  \n\nI still really like Marnee but no longer feel great raving about their curries.  And those prices?  Whew; that 2-dish dinner for 2 ran just under $30 pre-tip.  It is true, I'll likely return and eventually re-sample all those once beloved dishes.  It is also true that I'd continue to recommend Marnee to those who like Thai food.  I'm treading a little lighter this time around however.  The last time a place I loved started disappointing me it was the beginning of a slippery slope that led straight to my (probably) final and generous 2-star review.", "author": "Tracey A."}

We had Thai samosas which had an interesting mix of ingredients and were quite tasty! The imperial rolls had a full shrimp which is unusual for your standard fried spring rolls. We also ordered the fried corn cakes which were literally fried pieces of corn - how could you go wrong with that!\n\nI was a bit disappointed by the entrees - my biggest issue was the lack of vegetables. I believe it was the pad prig pow with chicken that mentions bell peppers but came with just 2 small pieces of bell pepper. Similarly, the pad see ew was just noodles and meat with a few pieces of basil.

The reviews on Yelp for Marnee Thai looked promising, but I doubted the place. It truly was an instinct of mine.

In my opinion, these Yelpers HAVE NOT experienced what really good Thai food should taste like. \n\nThe restaurant was not packed when we entered. It was lunch on a weekday, and Irving Street felt more asleep and tired than it usually does. We were seated, and given menus. The ambience/decor of the restaurant is a bit overdone. Very brown, bamboo and wooden accents everywhere. I ordered the Panang Beef, and my friend ordered the Vegetable Curry. My other friend wanted to order the Hot Cakes, however, the waitress rudely told us that they don't have those. We also ordered TWO Thai Iced Teas. The waitress came back with THREE Thai Iced Teas, Panang Beef, and the Vegetable Curry. We told her we ordered only two, but she insisted that we were wrong. Ridiculous.  \n\nThe Panang Beef was terrible. Dry chunks of beef simmered in a greasy sauce. I could barley chew the meat. The Vegetable Curry was nothing special at all.

The chicken wings were hella good, not crispy, but full of flavor and sauce.  Never had the coconut cakes before, but these little guys were good too.  They are filled with corn, taro, and coconut milk.  \n\nNow onto the entrees!  The pineapple fried rice was really good, but typical.  I was really looking forward to the pumpkin curry, but it was kind of disappointing.  Have to say I've had better - the flavor and creaminess was just not there.  The seafood curry on the other hand, was perfect.  The dish was very flavorful and packed a lot of meat.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the place and service - would come back again!", "author": "Kevin N."}

My friend and I decided to split an order of the Goong Sarong (prawns wrapped in bacon, wrapped, and fried) and an order of Pad Thai with prawns. \n\nThe goong sarong was great. Fresh and tasty!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-04", "description": "Well, i saw Marnee featured on the TV show \"Check Please\" and everyone at the table raved about it.  So we planned a visit to go check it out.\n\nFirst, up front, this is a small place that tends to be completely full at peak hours, which means you'll be eating almost face to face with your stranger table mates.  This kind of dining is not for me, but for really good food, I can usually tolerate it.\n\nLast night, in particular, was rough.  We had to endure every detail of the conversation next door.  Awkward.  Crowded dining like this should be outlawed.  But, the restaurant was completely full with a line, so the food must be killer...and so the anticipation grew.\n\nHad a reservation but we waited a bit.  That seems to be the way here as I've read that in other reviews.\n\nService was pretty good despite the crowd.  The owner (I'm assuming it was the owner) mills around the restaurant giving recommendations and taking orders.  She's extremely loud and borderline obnoxious but she didn't bother me really.  A restaurant needs a character like this--it's like a mascot for a sports team.  I think she actually tries to be a bit off-putting to put on a little show.\n\nShe came to our table and didn't lower the volume.  She scolded my wife for putting too much hot sauce on her coconut hotcakes and threatened to charge us for a jar of it.  And then she smiles and laughs big.  You see?  It's hard to dislike someone like that--even if they're abrasive.  She really pushed the Angel Wings as her recommendation so we got those.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nRED CHICKEN CURRY:  Huge curry lover, but this one fell below the mark.  The sauce was fine, but the chicken was a disappointment.  Tough and dry, not like chicken should be in a curry.  No good.  Didn't eat much of this.\n\nANGEL WINGS:  I'm very picky when it comes to wings.  I only eat the drummettes and never eat the wing side.  2 of the 5 wings they served were drummettes.  I ate both of them and they were very good.  They were fried almost crispy and then sauced.  And the sauce is unique, sweet and addicting, but not spicy enough.\n\nAVOCADO + PRAWN SALAD: Big let-down as I'm a huge fan of this combination.  Avocado was not fresh, a bit discolored in fact.  Lacked salad items, no cucumber, all I tasted was cilanto and mint.  And WAY over dressed.  It was like a soup.  You get the picture.  And the kicker?  The shrimp was undercooked and inedible. This salad gets an \"F\".\n \nTHAI BEEF SALAD:  Looked appetizing when it arrived but the meat was rubbery and had that \"what kind of meat is this\" flavor and texture.  Again, inedible for me.  My wife was reluctant at first to agree with me, but after a couple bites she stopped eating it.\n\nCOCONUT HOTCAKES:  Served as an appetizer, these cute little coconut puffs are tasty.  With some hot sauce, they were enjoyable.\n\nCRAB FRIED RICE:  This was good.  Not the best I've had, but it was done right.  Best crab rice I've ever had is at HONEY THAI in Milpitas.  If this is your thing, try it at HONEY THAI. Thank me later.\n\nSTICKY MANGO RICE:  This is the second time having this dessert.  The first time, at another restaurant.  This one was pretty good.  We special ordered coconut ice cream to be served with it.  Heavenly combo.  Highly recommended.  Sticky Mango Rice needs that third element! That said, their treatment of the sticky rice component was good in flavor but not 100 percent happy with the texture.  I'm going to do make this at home and play around with getting the sticky rice just right.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nBecause I'm fond of \"hole-in-the-wall\" places like this, I wanted to like this place.  And I do like it.  HOWEVER, I think people are exaggerating the greatness of this place.  Some say it's \"the best Thai they have ever had\".  Well, maybe those folks haven't gotten around much.  I've been to Thailand and that really heightens my perspective on this place.  This is *not* the best Thai I've ever had.  It's standard, and I'm sure they have a few specialty items on the menu that would qualify for excellent.  But two of our 5 dishes were inedible for me, and that's not good.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with a 3, but honestly, I don't think I would come back.  If this place was in my area, I would use it as a take-out place for certain dishes, the Angel Wings and the Crab Fried Rice etc.\n\nYes, overrated in my humble opinion but that happens occasionally, especially when a place like this gets some airtime on TV.\n\nI'm not a hater, just someone who is keeping it real!", "author": "Darien R."}

I was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the dishes here.\n\nSETTING\n-I really like the look and feel of this place. Super cute bamboo hut set-up. You really feel like you're inside a room made of bamboo. \n-Lots of traditional Thai decor, from the bowls/dishes the food is served on to the traditional garb worn by the waiters.\n-They have a sister location on 9th Ave, which is run by the owner's son. I personally prefer this location on Irving St better - it's a little more roomy and spacious and has a more romantic ambiance.\n\nFOOD \n-\"Hot Cakes\" - They have a special appetizer going on right now (Traditionally called 'Kanom Krok'). It's a popular Thai dessert that is rarely served in the US. It has a gelatinous texture made from tapioca flour and is cooked with coconut milk, and has bits of corn and taro in it. I recommend trying this out! \n-Po Tak Sopu! It's basically like Tom Yum Soup with seafood! Spicy and delicious! It had a lot of fresh vegetables, shrimp, octopus, and mussel for calamari. It's seasoned with a thai herb (kaffir lime) that I love so much that really brings out the authentic flavor of Tom Yum soups. \n-Kang Keaw!

I've had Marnee on my yelpdar for a while (at least a year) but just now finally made the journey down 19th.\n\nB R I E F  S U M M A R Y\n-- Good luck with parking (residential & metered)\n-- Small restaurant (can feel a bit cramped)\n-- Reservation might have been a smart idea\n-- Wait on Sat night for 3 was less than 20 minutes\n-- Definitely had the \"Mom & Pop\" Thai restaurant feel\n-- \"Mama Thai\" runs the restaurant and yells in Thai (staff is all Thai I think)\n-- Authentic and legit Thai flavors and spice\n-- Angel Wings *must try* spicy & flavorful basil peanut sauce\n-- Tom Kha Gai soup: serving was small for 3 but great flavors and taste\n-- Pad Thai is legit (not spicy)\n-- Ask for Prick Nam Blah (Thai peppers in fish sauce) to spice up your food\n-- Chicken green curry: great flavor, spicy and consistency\n\nI sort of grew up on Mom & Pop Thai restaurants so when I was really happy with the overall ambiance and atmosphere of Marnee Thai. The only place that I can really compare it to is Osha since it's also in SF. Even though, they're both Thai, I feel like Marnee is a bit more traditional especially when compared to the Osha Cafe's like the one in Glen Park that I frequent. Overall I felt like Marnee had better flavor and were more authentic and traditional versus the more modern Osha.\n\nAfter finding parking within a block *meant to be*, we waited for less than 20 minutes. I knew it was going to be busy, I mean it was Saturday night and we had just gotten out of a movie. I want to say it was around 6 or 7pm.\n\nI tend to like Thai places that have a lot of character. Someone else on yelp referred to the elder Thai running the restaurant as \"Mama Thai.\" I don't know if that's her nickname but it fits. You can tell she's been running a restaurant for a long time but she has a great personality and spirit. She took our order and was very vocal on suggestions and helpful with questions (not that we had many).\n\nA N G E L  W I N G S: The last time I was out this way, I was at San Tung trying their famous chicken wings. My GF's Mom works nearby and insisted on the Angel Wings. Now I love chicken wings and I like San Tung's but I'm definitely more of a fan of Thai food and officially a fan of Marnee's Angel Wings. The last time I had some Angel Wings at Osha, I was disappointed. Marnee's wings were deep fried and dressed with a dark red sauce. You could taste the garlic, basil and spice plus there was some peanuts for texture and nuttiness. Be careful, the wings are super hot when they come out. I could probably eat a whole appetizer with some white rice and call it a night. You must try them if you're a chicken wings fan.\n\nT O M  K H A  G A I: Also known as coconut soup with chicken, this is my favorite soup to get especially when I'm cold or sick. It came out mild but I added some peppers and took it to the next level of heat. There were so many great flavors coming out of the soup. The subtle sweetness of the coconut mixed with the lemongrass and ginger plus the spice of the Thai peppers makes this soup delish! I definitely recommend on a cold SF night.\n\nP A D  T H A I: Whenever I go to a Thai restaurant, I have to at least try their Pad Thai because it's one of Thailand's most famous and popular street food. If you have good Pad Thai, you usually have good everything else in my experience. I was not disappointed at all. Marnee's Pad Thai had the right amount of sauce and again the flavors had lots of depth and freshness. I added some prick nam blah (ask for it) and it took it to another level. Pad Thai in general is sweet and savory but when you add the Thai peppers it gives it that \"sweet heat\" that Thai food is known for. Add jasmine rice to cut the overwhelming spicy and sweetness and you're on your way to a Thai food coma!\n\nC H I C K E N  G R E E N  C U R R Y: I'm a big fan of green curry because it's usually served with some heat and it has eggplant. I've recently become a huge fan of eggplant and I was not disappointed here. The curry wasn't as creamy as I prefer but the flavors were still outstanding and rich. I mixed my curry with rice and devoured most of the curry myself. I loved the texture and taste of the eggplant with the chicken and rice.\n\nOverall the meal was outstanding. We didn't wait too long for food. It seemed as if things were flying out of the kitchen. I was really happy with the service except the drink refills (which came eventually). I was very pleased with all of the dishes and I really enjoyed the character of Marnee. I'll definitely be back again!", "author": "Daniel D."}

I WILL NOT DINE HERE EVEN IF YOU PAY ME.\n\nI have eaten here a couple of times. I use to think this place was really good but the most recent experience here will keep me from coming here ever again. I came here with my boyfriend for a late lunch before buying some groceries at Sunset Super down the street because we were hungry. \n\nI ordered the Pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken fried rice. First couple of bites was great, I was complementing to my boyfriend how good it tasted. Then a few bites later I told my boyfriend I think there might be some egg shells in there. \n\nI didn't think much of it because I chewed it up already, no big deal, it happens in my mind it wont kill me. A couple of bites later, I'm still eating the \"egg shells\" or so I thought. \n\nFinally, I got a piece of the \"egg shell\" out of my mouth and I was gonna show my boyfriend. Well I realized it was not eggshells at all.. it was clear and shinny. At first I was like what is that and then I was horrified, because I realized it was a piece of GLASS and not egg shells, I had been chomping on for the past few minutes.\n\nMy boyfriend waived down the waiter and we showed him the piece of GLASS. He asked me if I'm okay. I told him I think so but I've already eaten some of it. I told him I didn't want it anymore, and to be honest I lost my appetite. He then waived down another lady I'm presuming is the owner.\n\nHere is the double whammy of why I would not recommend this place.\n\nShe told me she can make another one for me. I told her I don't want another Pad Thai. She told me that there was nothing she can do and she can't give me any other dishes. I told her again I don't want it. But she kept insisting that she would pack it as a togo order. Okay at this point I was done talking; I didn't feel good, it made me sick just thinking I had ate glass. She comes back out with a packed Pad Thai and guarantees its new and a different one. Seriously, I wouldn't trust eating it, would you? \n\nWe ask for the check, and yes we were still charged for the GLASS Pad Thai. I've never had this happen to me before but from my understanding shouldn't they at least comp my dish and not force me to take the same Pad Thai dish for take out. Which I won't eat anyways...Yes you guessed it, I threw it in the trash; I was not going to risk myself in eating more glass.\n\nI have never in my life ingested glass, so I didn't know how harmful it can be till after I did some research on it when I returned home.\n\nI consider myself to be a really nice person because I was in total shock and didn't complain or throw a fit at the restaurant, nor did I call the HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Which I should have at the restaurant. Oh well, I'll rant on yelp.", "author": "Susan K."}

To test if that is really true, we came here to the Irving location aiming to order the same thing as last time to see if the bill would be any different.\n\nWe started out with the Homemade hotcakes which were both sweet & savory but not very well balanced.  I also wasn't too into the crispy on the outside, soft on the inside textural contrast.  We then moved on to the Pad prig khing which was garlicky, not too spicy, & just delicious.  We also had the Hung Lay curry which we usually loved.  But for some reason, the pork was though, there was very little sauce, & the presentation was pretty shabby.  We finished off with a Roti with coconut ice cream.  It was the most delicious thing all night but the awesomeness of the ice cream has definitely worn off.\n\nWe didn't order the exact same meal as when we were @ 9th Avenue but we ordered items that were the same price so it wouldn't unfairly affect the bill.  I tipped the usually 15% & our bill was $2 less.  We were right!  The be honest, even though the 9th Avenue locatoin is more expensive, it's probably worth it because the lighting is better there & there wasn't that traditional Thai music that would ring in my ears for hours to come.", "author": "Karen S."}

After seeing the restaurant reviewed on \"Check Please, Bay Area\", and raves from some friends, we finally made it down there while in the city.\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Angel Wings app. One word - amazing. These wings were smothered in a thick sauce that was like a hybrid of sweet Thai chili sauce, with a crap load of extra garlic, simmered down to a carmelized mess. They were so good that we ordered some to go before we left. \n\nSo like I said, expectations were very high after this. Ordered two entrees, the braised pork belly stir-fry, and what I consider the measuring stick for all Thai joints, Penang Curry (beef, in this case). The pork belly dish was decent, but I wouldn't get it again. The Penang Curry was a complete miss. The beef was overcooked,  dry, and very tough, and it was served with steamed broccoli like it was a side dish. This was supposed to be a curry, onions, peppers, and other veg in a sauce. There was almost no sauce. I've been to Thai places where their curry was drowning in too much sauce (no like), but this was 180 degrees the other way. What a letdown.\n\nOne last thing, and if anybody actually reads this, please answer this question. Is it a West coast thing to charge for steamed rice? All the years I lived in Florida, and all the Thai/Viet places we went to, I can't ever remember being charged extra for rice. My mother was Indonesian. Steamed rice on the table at mealtime was like breathing air. Who eats a curry, stir-fry, etc, without rice? It just isn't done. But now I am.", "author": "Phil A."}

The place was totally full, and we waited right inside the entry way for a while hoping to catch the attention of the hostess, before realizing that you must cross through the restaurant to the back counter in order to putyour name down. The hostess/grand dame of the restaurant seated us as quickly as she could, adding a third chair to a table of two, which the waiters then had to dance around the rest of the night. The interior of the place is lined with woven reed mats and there are old school Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling, and beer bottles lining the interiors of the planters. Definitely a smaller, different vibe from the 9th street location.\n\nWe are vegetarian and ordered the corn hotcakes, green papaya salad, pad see ew noodles, green pumpkin curry, and tofu praram.\n\nGreen papaya salad was standard. The pad see ew was delicious and perfect and had cauliflower in it which we enjoyed -- we judge and compare thai restaurants by this dish and they passed with flying colors. The corn hotcakes were not fritters, or really anything like pancakes, as one might expect-- they were closer to quiche or flan in consistency and tasted like coconut. We enjoyed the flavor of the pumpkin curry immensely, but wished it had more pumpkin in it. Tofu praram sauce was delicious,  but the tofu it covered was deep fried (and not fresh deep fried) which took away from the dish.\n\nThe true highlight of coming here was watching this grand dame dim the lights, beat the gong, and lead the restaurant in singing \"Happy Birthday\" to various customers who presumably were celebrating their birthdays. This happened no less than three times, and each time she followed the song with a speech tailored to the individual that was part benediction and part stand-up comedy.

It's super flavorful and a nice meat dish to have with rice\n\n-Chan pad poo: personally really like this because it has crab meat and a sweeter taste (and it's a nice alternative to always eating the generic pad thai which is also very good here) \n\n-Pork with string beans (not sure what it's called but this is basically what it is): favorite veggie dish here", "author": "Truc D."}

I made the mistake of trying other places and I will never do that again! SoCal's Thai food CANNOT compare to this. Marnee's dishes are cooked to perfection. Their awards are well deserved!\n\nPad Thai: 3.5 stars. When I first came here about a year ago, their pad thai was a 5 star for me but I dont know why the quality went down... It was the only dish I ordered every time I came here, but not anymore. However, it still beats other restaurants.

My friends LOVE this dish. I personally think it's average. It is definitely full of flavors.

However I came here last night and was somewhat disappointed. I ordered the Duck Pad See Ew which is usually a slightly sweet but savory dish with a generous amount of duck stirred in. This time the noodles were salty and soggy. There wasn't much meat either, mainly pieces of duck skin. I was sad because the Duck Pad See Ew never disappointed me before.\n\nMy friend got the Seafood Curry with Rice, it was only a curry and the rice had to be ordered separately. It tasted amazing, very smooth and creamy, just the right consistency to pair with rice. But for the portion size and price, it should have come with rice.\n\nThe waitresses weren't very attentive either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-27", "description": "Stoked about this place since I did some research around the SF area for the best thai place and came across Marnee.\n\nLocated in a relatively chinese neighborhood in Sunset, I was surprised to find Marnee here. I came in for dinner and away from the streets I was taken into a settled thai ambiance. The interior was shaped like a hut, look up to the ceiling and you'll see what I mean. The whole place was wrapped with bamboo or straw and decorated with exotic plants. Humble soft instrumental music was playing. I felt like I was in the tropics.\n\nAfter narrowing down my choices, I came down to Angel sticky wings for appetizers, chan pad poo for the entree and mango with sticky rice for dessert. Service was quick and the wait staff was very attentive, my water was refilled nearly every 2 - 3 mins. The wait staff even checked up on us too which is rare compared to the asian cuisine I've tried so far in SF.\n\nThe angel sticky wings were delish!!!! Holy moly, I don't know what sauce it is but it's finger licking good!!!! I loved the crispy leaves that was topped over the wings. Tip: while ordering any spicy dish, be careful with the level of spice. I got mild and I was still able to taste the spiciness on my lips afterward.\n\nThe chan pad poo was just as amazing. The noodles were soft and tender, there was a lot of flavors in the dish. It was piping hot while served and still hot while I ate it. Steam was coming out the whole time. Yet it didn't burn my tongue. The only flaw with the dish would be the lack of peanuts but that's because I always love having peanuts in my thai dishes. It feels like a necessity.\n\nLastly, the grand finale, the mango sticky rice. It was a savory chunk of sticky rice drizzled with coconut sauce and paired with a generous serving of freshly sliced mango. The combination of both sticky rice and mango was delectable. The sauce was a great compliment for the mango as well.\n\nAnother note, this is the FIRST restaurant I've tried in San Francisco that had the aroma of the food flowing from the dish itself. I smelled the wings while the waitress was walking toward me. The food was also served right off the grill yet it was still warm enough to eat! Such perfect timing.\n\nGiven in mind for the price and quality, Marnee is off the roof. They give 5+ stars quality and service for a small and reasonable price. This is definitely one of my favorite thai restaurants of ALL TIME.\n\nMarnee holds the quality of everything a thai restaurant should be. Authentic, flavorful and spicy.\n\nSo if you're in the area, skip all those chinese restaurants. It's a waste of money and time. Come to Marnee for an authentic experience and phenomenal thai cuisine. I promise you, you'll be taken to another place the moment you step in. The music they play does wonders in blocking out any outside noise. \n\n\nMarnee, you've outdone yourself compared to the thai cuisines in NY. You are #1 on my list. Keep it up!!!!", "author": "Virginia Y."}

OHEMGEE, the sauce is amazingly good!! Although the menu marks this dish as spicy, it is really not. Its sweet and honey taste that I just couldn't get enough of it! \n\nBesides the Angel Wings, we also ordered the Honey/Sweet BBQ Pork over Rice. This dish was not bad, but definitely can't compare with the Angel Wings sauce. In addition to this BBQ pork rice, we ordered a coconut milk baked with fish fillet and veggie dish as our entree. I think this coconut milk bake is called something like \"Hah Mu.\" The fish and veggie are wrapped in some long leaves and covered with creamy red curry-looking sauce topped with creamy (not \"liquidy\") coconut milk. It is not spicy even the waitress told me that it is. I personally do not really like it. \n\nLastly, we ordered the Sticky Rice with Mango as dessert (this is the whole reason that we came to this restaurant). We ordered way too much food, so in the end, we both had take-outs :p. But we finished the delicious dessert in the end. When the warm sticky rice with salty coconut milk is being eaten with a small slice of fresh mango, it creates this heavenly as well as a blasting (warm rice + cold mango) feelings. I was not expecting the combination would be so GOOOOD! After the first bite, I just could not stop eating it even though I was already full from the previous dishes. \n\nIf you were going to eat at this place, I would recommend their ANGEL WINGS and the Sticky Rice with Mango! :)", "author": "Pui L."}

I've not been disappointed walking out of this place until my most recent visit.\n\nI've been on a Massaman Curry hype for the last year and knew that I HAD to order it at Marnee during my next visit. To my surprise I was very disappointed in their version. Extremely watery and not that flavorful.. I hate to say even I make a better massaman curry and I've only cooked thai dishes a little more than a handful of times..The chicken was super tender, that was pretty much the only good thing about it unfortunately... \n\nBut! Other than that I've always left satisfied. The wings live up to the hype for sure! My boyfriends not even a big fan of Asian/sweeter wings but he enjoys these ones. I also love their \"golden triangles\" which is pretty much like a pumpkin samosa, super yummy. I've also enjoyed their yellow and green curries...and although I'm not a huge pad thai person I love theirs! I enjoy how theirs is a little more spicy than it is sweet unlike other places...\n\nThis place used to be pretty cheap and now, not so much...but with SF being so expensive and their popularity I don't blame them. I hope my most recent experience was just a \"bad trip\" (everything else was good though) and not a sign of them going downhill. Still looking forward to another visit in the future..\n\nside note... I've been to both of their spots but personally prefer this one.

San Francisco is rich in decent neighborhood eateries, and the only ones that stand out to me are the ones that have excellent customer service, and the ones that have terrible customer service. Marnee Thai falls into the latter column.\nIn my latest visit I ordered ahead on Eat24 and my wife went on her way home to pick it up. They treated her like dirt and gave her a hard time when she tried to pick up (she wasn't aware that my order showed up under my Yelp handle, not my real name. Rather than trying to help her sort it out, they told her to get lost. They eventually sorted it out, but not in a pleasant way. My wife is generally a nicer and easier going person than me, so when she tells me that somebody was rude to her, I believe it. When I called Marnee Thai to voice my displeasure with the way they handled the situation, the person on the line argued with me about what had happened and why. A simple apology would have sufficed, but this person doubled down on justifying their rude behavior. She put more effort into arguing with me on the phone than she put into helping my wife when she was there in person. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. We won't be returning or reordering from them ever again.\nAnd by the way, the food we ordered that night was mediocre at best - bland eggplant, gross pad Thai, dry flabby chicken. \nIf you want good Thai food paired with better than average service, hit up Chabaa or Sri Thai instead.", "author": "Jay L."}

Another minus is that when we ordered, our waitress (she might have been the owner?) kept pushing us to order another special they had that I didn't want to the point where it made me feel kind of awkward and I had to make up a fake excuse that I didn't like taro lol.\n\nBut onto the food! We ordered:\n\n- Golden triangles: These are Thai samosas stuffed with pumpkin/potato/curry. It was probably the best samosa I've ever had! \n- Stir fry Pork Belly Stew (one of their specials): I usually only order either curry or a noodle dish when I go eat Thai, but I'm so glad I tried something new! The pork belly was not only full of flavor, but it was also super melt-in-your-mouth tender. They also put a tiny bit of coconut milk on top and it was perfect!\n- Pad Thai: I was craving noodles, so I got the Pad Thai but it was just alright, very average. I wouldn't recommend it, because there are much better dishes here that you can get. The flavor was okay, but there wasn't enough eggs. I would recommend the Guay Tiew Koor for noodles because it has bigger/more flavorful pieces of fried egg and fried egg is awesome.\n-Hot Tea: costs $1.25/person but there is someone constantly refilling the tea so you never have cold tea!\n\nOverall, I would definitely be back for takeout (definitely a 5 star takeout restaurant), but because it's so overcrowded I would hesitate before coming in for a sit -down experience. Still, the food is awesome!", "author": "Christina L."}

Once again, I set out to try another one of their featured restaurants. This time Marnee Thai was on my to-try list.  I decided to bring the parentals and grandparentals with me for dinner.\n\nOn tv everything looks bigger right? The restaurant looked a lot bigger when it was shown on the program. It's nice and cozy but for the 5 of us, we were a bit cramped at our table. We wanted to sit at a larger table but the waitress said it was reserved. \n\nThe portions were a bit on the smaller size so maybe that also looked larger on tv as well. We ordered the green curry pork, sauteed prawn and scallop, sauteed chicken, tom yum soup, pad se-ew and pumpkin curry. Everything was alright. There were no standout dishes. We also got the mango sticky rice for dessert. I thought it was a little disappointing. The rice was very mushy and the mango slices were a bit skimpy. Overall average Thai food.

Second, we just ate there last night, having searched far and wide for the best Thai in San Francisco. This aint it, I can tell you. Delicious? I think not. Maybe if you dont know Thai food. Or have low standards. We ordered the Tea Leaves Salad as an appetiser. That was fairly good, but way too much lettuce. Also under appetiser the kling something pork, spicy wrapped in lettuce cups. That was pretty good, and spicy as promised. Then things went south. The banana (plantain) chicken red curry was unacceptable. Chicken tasted freezer-burned and was tough. We ordered the dish spice and it was actually not only mild but bland and tasteless. Weird for Thai food. Not enough sauce. When we sent it back for a more spicy sauce, they just sprinkled a bunch of red pepper on top. How lame is that. We sent it back and ordered instead the Pad Prig (spicy chicken stir fry.) That also came with red pepper sprinkled on top. It was spicy but an extremely dull boring uninspired dish. What a disappointment this place is. It is just plain mediocre. Good Thai food is really fantastic. This doesnt come close. All the reviews and stars  - there is zero passion in the food. Riding on their (undeserved) reputation, folks who know no better think it's good. The best Thai, as far as I have experienced, in SF is: Thep Phanoum on Fillmore, and Lemongrass on Polk is also quite good.", "author": "Anne B."}

I kept telling her no because I'm going to add it on my card. But she kept saying that its what they have to do.\n\nBULL.\n\nFirst of all, you've been kind of annoying the whole night so I DON'T actually have to tip you 15%. But it was a holiday so why not.

This place is super super cramped. So many tables squished into the restaurant, I feel like the waiters and waitresses had their butts in peoples faces, were turning to the side to squeeze by tables, and I'm surprised no one was elbowed. Given that, for how quick paced this restaurant is and how many people they were serving, it was run pretty well. Our waters were refilled without asking, and we did get some attention from the wait staff. The food was good, but not amazing. My pad Thai was your average pad Thai. The pad ke mao my friends had was super SPICY. They were only able to finish about half of it. We also ordered the calamari salad to share. It had potential, but the sauce that it was marinated in tasted straight up like like juice. My mouth puckered with every bite, even when I picked off the top pieces (the bottom of the dish was drowned in like juice) \n\nOverall, I wouldn't rush to return here.

Also, It's because of their damn Angel Wings [http://s3yelp4-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/ccajWGzpzlFAAnTcXc9WsQ/l.jpg] that keeps me coming back!

This was also one of the daily specials they were offering so what the hey. I'm not gonna go too in depth on a salad because my carnivorous mentality can't judge one so in a nutshell: it was some mixed tossed greens, [raw-tasting] mangoes, and pounded on the dressing. The soft-shelled crab however hit dead center; crispy, crunchy, lightly fried, perfect.\n\nRoasted Duck Red Curry -- [http://s3yelp1-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/q02hRBhJFpD1MDNQXZUxzg/l.jpg]\nI'm a huge fan of roasted duck! [It runs through my Chinese veins!] If it weren't so expensive, I'd trade my diet of beef for duck any day! The red curry (which was more orange rather) was pretty good. Nice portions of roasted duck is always a major bonus (and a must!), the curry had a hint of spiciness to it for a surprising kick, and there were chops of pineapple for a interesting sweetness to it as well. \n\nTom Yum Soup -- [http://s3yelp3-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/fiXOaPiKYk2e4PGsdnCBNA/l.jpg]\nThis one is a tricky one to judge.. For the ones of you reading this that KNOW how a Tom Yum soup is suppose to taste, than you will be disappointed. However, for those who are new to it, this might run up your alley. Overall, the soup wasn't overwhelming sour as with other Tom Yum soups I've drank and was loaded with plump whole shrimp, and all the components of a chicken noodle soup (minus the noodles). Personally, I'm not much of a sour eater (I like it spicy) so this was for me, but I know this didn't swing well with my friends that KNEW real Tom Yum. \n\n\nOkay! \nClearly, the food is great, however, the service is what's going to take Marnee Thai down a peg. In short, our female server was ridiculously rude. She rushed us to make an order (even though it wasn't busy). We asked for more water during our meal (because the food is spicy!) but our request was ignored. And with her apathetic expression, she just seemed like she didn't want to be there. \n\nOn the other hand, the male gentlemen was the completely opposite!

But it will be the dish every time I visit Marnee. Genius for a delicious creation! \n\n2) Yellow Curry with rice, who can say no to curry. From the platting to the pallette, my eyes and tongue was happy. Rice was soft, curry was creamy and spicy. Absolutely no complaints! \n\nDefinitely delicious, and will not disappoint. Did I mention, it there are candles? Super romantic!", "author": "Phuong V."}

Your call.\n\nThe pad see ew with chicken was really good, \"make you want to come back\" good.  \n\nBut we had a weird run-in with the waitress on rice.  My girlfriend ordered one serving rice.  The waitress brought out a fair amount of rice, and then we shared as I ate some of her dish.\n\nThe waitress then charged us for two rice.  We had a little communication difficulty but it seemed as though we got charged for sharing rice, which is ridiculous - of all the things to be stingy on, rice should not be at the top of your list.\n\nThankfully the waitress removed a rice, but she made it clear that if we order rice again in future, we'll have to pay for each person to eat.  Which is fine, IF we order two servings of rice.  If we order one serving of rice, then it shouldn't matter how many people eat,  just like we weren't double charged for sharing our entrees.\n\nAnyway I'd still recommend you to check out, but just be careful if you intend to share a serving of rice - apparently it's kind of a big deal here.", "author": "Charlie B."}

My friend was intrigued by the special sign that announced Thai Potstickers with a green curry filling. The potstickets were slightly crispy outside with a green curry pork filling. Chopped fresh basils on top give the dumplings an extra kick, along with the spice and the curry.\n\nOver two days we tried different entrees that are staples on any Thai menu. Gai Kaprow (Sauteed basil chicken) here at Marnee is cooked dry, the minced chicken absorbing the essence of the sauce simmered in fresh basil, chili paste scallions, and red chili pepper. It's the perfect dish to be accompanied with rice.\n\nSuteed Eggplant with Chicken is cooked with shredded chicken in soy  sauce, bean sauce, and garlic. It's a welcoming diversion from chili and basil. This is a good non-spicy dish. Asparagus Chicken has a generous portion of crispy asparagus cooked in a sweet chili sauce.\n\nThe Thai Chicken Green Curry is one of my favorites at Marnee. The coconut milk gives the curry a fine creamy texture, complete from fresh lime juice and gives an aroma long has reached my nose before the dish is set down on the table. Top with sprigs of fresh basil, green curry is the spiciest curry and it's absolutely delicious.\n\nMarnee is pricey compared to regular Thai places, but the food is always tasty.

After we revved up our appetites on the hills with the stunning views, we headed for this restaurant. I recalled many times I was unable to try it out, due the daunting long lines out the door. I rejoiced as the line was much shorter & the older woman in the lacey top kept coming out tracking us. The line was moving quickly. After about 15 minutes or so, we were seated in a middle, cramped space, sitting with strangers with no real privacy.  We ordered our drinks, the lady in the lace top suggested we try coconut cakes & pretty much ordered them for us, Hmmmm. We felt was cramped in and then our drinks were served hot (soda). Our pot stickers were some of the best we have ever had, delicately flavored and perfect! This was the best part of our meal! And then, I took an adventure to get the hor mok, a steamed seafood custard, only served on weekend, that I had read about on the Internet. It came out rather quickly to my surprise, only to be cold, and then what I realized later, was frozen in the middle. It had a kind of a thawed out strange texture and stale taste. It certainly was not freshly made! Much later I wondered had it been micro waved and/or thawed out and warmed up somehow for assembly line type service.  Was I in a fast food joint was an afterthought? I was trying to eat it as best I could, but had to stop. And then, my boyfriend got the red curry with prawn, thinking he wasn't being too adventurous, too\" authentic.\" And then, the string beans had a strange thawed out frozen strange texture, & it was in the form of a thin soupy sauce. (He had not ordered soup!!). And then, he noticed a strange flavor, and then the prawns were rubbery, not even fresh. Even the brown rice was dry and flavorless like cardboard, stale and dry, not freshly made!  We could not be mistaken about the rice!!! We know what rice tastes like!  It all seemed like frozen food that was micro waved! We did not realize this until we left completely disappointed at this \"Zagat\" rated restaurant.  And then, they forgot the pretty much forcibly ordered coconut pancakes, which I had hoped would save the day!\nBut these also made my stomach upset. I tried one and had to quit, thinking that the oil it was cooked in was possibly rancid. I went from my original feeling of wanting to venture out into a more authentic experience, to realize I had gotten some frozen dinners at a restaurant that was pushing its customers in and out quickly!  We thought we would be adventurous, but this experience had ruined my spirit for a long time to come and we vowed to stick with our tried and true dishes. What I eventually determined that the food was not prepared in a fresh manner, nor was it true to the traditions of most Thai and San Francisco food preparation standards.\n\nWe wrote a letter finally after many calls requesting our money back. We were too polite to ask then and there as we should have.  Our food was inedible. I spoke with the manager Ms. Jen multiple times (3-4 times.) She promised her manager Mr. Chai would call me back. He never did and then he finally did and yelled at me, admitted the food was not freshly prepared and blamed it on a busy day! (It was not THAT BUSY). He blamed for me not asking for a refund then and there & still refused to refund me out money, even though I had called multiple times and they didn't return my calls.

My sister and I grabbed a quick dinner here over the weekend and as always we ordered basil chicken and pad sa ew, since those are pretty basic thai dishes. Basil chicken was swimming in a pool of oil. It was also on the sweeter side and no thai chili in it at all but a few slivers of jalape\u00f1o, not authentic at all. I know thai chilies can sometimes be pricier but this place charges a little more than your average thai restaurant. The pad sa ew lacked flavor.

So much so that I used to come once a week!  (But since my food truck habit is thinning out my wallet, my visits have sadly diminished.)\n\nMy \"regular\" is the PAD KAPROW (chopped chicken sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basil) and the beef PAD SE EW (fried rice noodles with soy bean, broccoli and egg).  Served with rice, I feel like if I was Thai I'd say, \"Just like how Mom used to cook.\"  I also recommend their roasted boneless duck served with spinach and house sauce, and the spicy angel wings.  Finish the meal with a fried banana and ice cream or the mango with sticky rice, then wash it all down with a Thai ice tea or coffee.  Yummers all around.\n\nA couple things to note...there is a 2nd location on 9th Street, but for whatever reason I think the Irving one is better.  Parking is a drag unless you're like me and are usually blessed with good parking karma.  The serving sizes are pretty decent so unless you have a large enough party, it's pretty easy to over order.

I guess I don't feel TOO bad, considering Marnee was fairly busy when we got there on a Saturday evening, so here it goes...\n\nI'm baffled at any restaurant that calls a dish a curry if there's no actual sauce. I ordered the chicken satay and panang beef, and my compatriot ordered spicy pork. The chicken satay was acceptable but I wish the peanut sauce had more flavor and the chicken had a little more char. The panang curry, however, legitimately offended me. Chunks of overcooked beef hanging out on a plate with little to no sauce, and certainly no semblance of the coconut milk it was purported to have been cooked in. Maybe a lack of sauce or vegetables is fine for some folks (who don't have an intuitive understanding of Asian cuisines) but hey, I'm pretty a traditional gal. That dish shouldn't have even been listed under \"curries.\" What part of that was I supposed to put on top of my rice? Yeah, a real disappointment. \n\nIn addition, the phrase \"where's the fire?\" has never been more applicable to the workers in a restaurant. I'm not one to complain about poor service if the food makes up for it, but our server was literally taking our orders as she ran past our table. Like, would it kill you to pause for two seconds, lady? I mean, I get it, I worked food service too and things get busy.

However, Marnee Thai....Definitely shocked me, it is one of the best place to get Thai food in San Francisco. \n\nFrom the looks of this tiny little restaurant from outside, you might be thinking to yourself \"this place looks a little sketchy\". However, the interior is like a total opposite from the outside. The inside is a nice and warm little hut with beautiful dim lighting. Also, the people working there were all wearing traditional dress/robe. It felt warm and close to home.\n\nMy friends got seated right away and we were greeted quickly with water. We ordered lots of food share and let me tell you, they were the best Thai food i had besides home. \n\nFOOD: \n\nSamosa ( curry w/ Potatoes wrapped in flour, deep fried ) - It was nasty for me, my friends thought otherwise. The curry was too sweet for me, I like my curry spicy because that is how my mom always make Samosa. \n\nAngel Wings (Spiced fried chicken wings) - delicious, the best thing i ate that night. the wings were covered in sauce and you can still feel the crunchiness of the skin when you bite into it. The flavor was so rich, it was sweet and spicy at the same time. one of a kind. \n\nThai Style Fried Rice - I got it with beef but you can get it with chicken and i think pork. It wasn't like any other fried rice i had at other Thai Restaurants which tasted awful. one they brought it out, i can tell it was good just by the smell of it. The rice was good. The beef was even better, It was not chewy at all.( Most restaurants don't know how to cook beef, trust me) The only little bad thing was i wish the beef was a little bit on the raw side. Then it would be perfect!\n\nPad Thai - it was good but a little on the sour side. \n\nPad Se Ew- Good, but it is kind of just like beef chow fun. \n\nService - Great and friendly, they always came and refill our waters and asked us how things are doing. \n\nThe only bad thing about this place is it is too small, it is bad if you are with 8 or more friends.

Then I looked around and counted the number of Caucasians on one hand and realized this was an Asian-approved authentic spot. \n\nWe had the following dishes to share: \n\nAvocado salad with soft shell crab and mango -- great size and no skimping on the crab. The soft shell crab was the right texture, and did not become soggy from the salad. The dressing was light and flavorful. Great starter. \n\nCoconut hot cakes with corn -- my first time trying these as recommended by the owner. Somewhat savory, somewhat sweet. They come in little portions (7 per order) and come out piping hot. I enjoyed the homemade chili sauce on top of these. I would have liked the texture of these to be a little more consistent -- almost felt undercooked inside even though it was crispy on the outside. \n\nMiang kam (spinach leaves with dried shrimp, peanuts, ginger, lime, coconut, sauce) -- a rare find on a North American Thai menu. A fun bit of work putting together these bite-sized snacks. \n\nHong lay pork stew with pineapple -- this was okay. Instead of my typical red curry chicken or chili basil beef, I gave in to trying something new. I found it to be more sweet than savory due to the pineapple. \n\nPad prig pao pork -- this was okay. Flavors were nice, but would have been nice to have this a little more saucy. \n  \nBrown rice -- hearty and wild. I really liked this. $2 for a small bowl. \n\nMango sticky rice -- pretty good. \n\nThai iced tea -- best I've had in years. \n\nPrices were okay, service was good.

I must say however, that it didn't live up to the hype. Maybe it was the time we went, or what we ordered but we were both expecting an amazing experience.\n\nWe ordered:\nSpicy Angel Wings -- this dish was gooey, sticky, crispy and sweet like honey, but not as spicy as I anticipated since \"spicy\" is part of the dish's name.  I felt that the sauce that it came in was a little too thick and overpowering. I had burnt finger tips from handling this hot (temperature-wise) dish.  The meat was tender but again, I think the sauce really overpowered any chicken flavor. \n \nSimmered Pork Randang Curry -- tender pork with lots of flavor. The sauce or curry was scarce and a little runny for my liking though since I like to pour sauce all over my rice.\n\nMango Fried Rice with Chicken -- came with big chunks of chicken, mango and eggs. I thought this dish alone didn't have much flavor. It lacked sweetness from the mango and any real depth. I had to add some of the sauce they had on their table to give it any flavor.  \n\nDessert:\nRoti with coconut ice cream -- SOOOOOOOO freakin' delicious! It got the right textures of crisp, gooey softness, and firmness. It was not overly sweet. It had great coconut flavor which mixed well with the sweetness of the condensed milk drizzled over the roti. I wanted this one all to myself AND order another. If it were based on this dessert alone, I would've happily given Marnee Thai 4 stars!\n\nService was OK. It took them a few minutes to get us menus and take our drink orders. They refilled our waters when they got low without us having to ask. However, they brought out the food too quickly. We were still working on our hot chicken wings when they brought out our other two dishes which were initially steaming but had cooled off considerably when we finally got to them.\n\n I wonder if Marnee Thai has a back door since other reviewers have commented on them taking their trash out through the front door.

Bay Area and decided to give it a try when Meana K came to visit a month or so ago. Many Thai places offer more or less the same options such as stir fries, curries, fried rice etc. but Marnee has something different on their menu that is worth trying.\n\nTry their coconut hot cakes for appetiser: soft on the inside, nice crust on the outside and they come out a sizzling cast iron pan. A little chilli sauce makes it just perfect. This is so good, I could easily finish two orders by myself. Another must-try is their miang kham. Traditional miang kiam is made with wild betel leaves, to my understanding but theirs were served with spinach instead. Regardless the flavours were there. Hor Mok, which is a steamed fish meat with curry mousse in a banana wrapper was excellent and I highly recommend that. I also enjoyed their avocado and soft shell crab salad. My only complaint is that it's not much of a Thai dish.\n\nWhile the appetisers were well prepared, entrees were just okay. Pad prik pao pork and hong lay pork tasted good but lacked some intensity in flavours. The menu has a variety to choose from but it just seems like most things are stir fries with more or less the same ingredients: bamboo shoots, peppers, onions, cashews with slight variations.\n\nI would come back again for the appetisers and the service at this location. The head waitress, whom I assumed is the owner, is very charismatic and she tries super hard to make everyone happy. Great experience overall.", "author": "Kwoky L."}

NO JOKE. The noodles are creamy and soft, the shrimp and tofu is cooked to perfection, and the chopped peanuts and bean sprouts are sprinkled evenly throughout the dish. However, the waitress messed up the pad thai order for the bf. He asked for beef in place of shrimp but nope, the pad thai did not arrive on our table with beef pieces in it.\n\nI ordered #22 panang beef with a side of jasmine rice (additional cost). Conversely, I asked for chicken. The pieces of chicken were covered in a delicious yellow coconut curry sauce that was TO DIE FOR. So good, so good! It also came with \"a side of broccoli\" which realistically was only four chunks of boiled broccoli. I wish it was sauteed, but it's okay. The overall taste of the dish made up for it!\n\nSucks how we arrived at the restaurant at 3:10pm. The lunch hours end at 3. We could have got our dishes a dollar or two cheaper (my cheap Asian side coming out...) but I can't complain. We had a lovely, satisfying meal.", "author": "Annie S."}

The Tamarind sauce tasted nothing like tamarind but more like a disgusting sugary gravy, it was truly awful and inedible. The flavours of the sausage (which is also sugary sweet and not tasty), egg, and vegetables were not complimentary to the sugar gravy at all. I do not recommend this dish.\n\nThe Roasted Duck was no better. It was served on a bed of steamed spinach, which would have been the only edible part, but it too was in a terrible sauce that had way too much sugar in it. Duck and sugar??? There was also a garlic flavour. The amount of actual duck in the dish was about 30% ratio duck to 70% fat and NON crispy skin. If the skin were crispy and not floppy and inedible, this would not be an issue as I know duck is fatty. This was not the case. I would recommend going down the street to Lam Hoa Thuan Restaurant  instead, it's cheaper and you really get CRISPY duck, not fat, gristle and floppy skin.\n\nEverything was also Cold. I called in order at 5:55pm, they told me 15! minutes and when I arrived at 6:17, my food was already packed and ready to go??? WHAT??\n\nSo disappointed in Marnee as I eat here often and this was my first bad experience. I usually stick to curries, appetizers, salads and the delicious corn hotcakes, I would suggest you do the same.", "author": "emma g."}

Yes, the same asshole who made me cry on my birthday weekend and never tried to make it up to me. I sure know how to pick the winners! Anyway, back to Marnee Thai. I braved the 40-minute drive to stuff my pig face with their amazing Pad Kee Mao I had been dreaming about non-stop for a few weeks straight. I couldn't wait to smother the savory noodles all over my face and flat chest while masticating on some amazing and phallic Fresh Spring Rolls. Can you imagine what a gastronomically erotic night I was anticipating to experience?\n\nI didn't mind the spotty service - we had to grab our own menus and ask twice before we received water, but I didn't even care because I knew the food would make up for everything, or so I thought. When our dishes finally arrived, I almost started bawling in the middle of the restaurant because nothing tasted appetizing. I couldn't believe it. I reluctantly agreed to have my Pad Kee Mao cooked with thin noodles since the they were out of the wide flat type, hoping at least the flavor would be the same. After sticking a forkful in my piehole, I realized the sauce tasted strangely ketchup-like and the tomatoes were overcooked. So disgusting. The Fresh Spring Rolls were drenched with extremely salty sauce and had us reaching for water. We also found the Massaman Curry subpar with very little liquid. \n\nDespite my awful dinner, I'm still willing to give the place another chance to redeem itself, just like I've given the asshole chances that he didn't value.

Although I am no expert, I have a pretty good idea on what good, authentic, Thai and Lao food taste like; plus I like to eat out, and have tried several different Lao/Thai restaurants.\n\nThe Thai food here is phenomenal. Starting with the hotcakes; most Thai restaurants don't offer this authentic dessert. I use to always go to the Thai temple in Berkeley to get some more authentic Thai hotcakes, but the seasoning that Marnee Thai uses makes it at least 3x better.\n\nThe Pad Thai has just enough spice, peanuts, bean sprouts, tofu, and all the other ingredients that make it a well balanced noodle dish. But it doesn't stop there, the Pumpkin Curry is probably my favorite dish. There are many options of meat such as chicken, beef, duck and more. This is a dish that I recommend enjoying with a white wine, such as a white meritage of sauv blanc & semillion ( I recommend a St. Supery Virtu).\n\nThere are so many more wonderful dishes that I can go on and on about but I won't have enough space to write about it here. If you can't have Marnee Thai everyday, every week, or every month like I can; purchase their amazing cook book by their world class chef and co-owner Chai Siriyan. He will teach you how to bring Marnee Thai to your home no matter where you live. Both he and his wife, May, are wonderful people and if you get chance to meet them you will find how  warm, charming, and humble they both are. And if you are lucky, you might be able to get your book autographed like me =).  For someone who doesn't cook, Chai's cookbook shows you how to be that Master Chef that your didn't know you were.\n\nI have had lots of great Thai food, but poor service. I have also had poor Thai food, but excellent service. Chai & his amazing wife May, have figured out how to combine both and that's why I truly recommend Marnee Thai in SF.", "author": "Tony P."}

They made the inside of the restaurant look like a bamboo hut and I thought it was creatively cute.\n\nTheir menu is full of choices--it was hard to decide.  We ended up getting the special summer rolls, green papaya salad, and beef salad for starters.  Then we ordered seafood pad se-ew, chan pad poo (upon waitress' recommendation), and pad thai. Each meal came presentable and adored with an orchid on the side. They have an ongoing theme of orchids...they must have an orchid garden, I thought. \n\nSo, what we thought:\n-summer rolls were meh::3/5\n-green papay salad:: 3.5/5 it wasn't spicy enough, although we asked to have it real spicy\n-beef salad:: 3.5/5 taste real fresh and beefy but it was a tad bit salty\n-seafood pad se-ew:: 5/5 we all loved it!!  \n-chan pad poo::4.5/5 my sister liked it better than the pad thai and it was real tasty\n-pad thai::3.5/5 \n\nAlthough I can say I'm a fan, I'd like to try other Thai spots before I feel I need to be only returning to this one.", "author": "LC B."}

The wings had a nice glaze to them but they were not spicy at all.\n~ Pad Thai: one of the better Pad Thais that I've had...their shrimp were nice and succulent (not overcooked at all) and they actually had tofu in it too =)\n~ Spicy Thai Style Fried Rice with Chicken: They don't normally make it spicy but they were able to accommodate my request as I was craving spicy foods.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very spicy but you can pick up hints of cayenne and pepper.  The rice was very flavorful and not too greasy, which is the problem with a lot of Thai fried rice dishes.

From the outside, you don't expect that the inside looks like a straw/bamboo hut. (My friend called it a \"bahay kubo.\") The restaurant seats about 10-12 small parties, so make sure you make a reservation if you are coming in for dinner. The service is extremely quick & efficient. The lady who took our order is this no nonsense, tiny, kick-ass woman who memorized the three dishes that was to be our lunch.\n\nToday, the BFF & I enjoyed:\n- yellow curry with chicken & white rice (more than enough for two people)\n- pad thai (awesome)\n- one of their specials: sea bass in a garlic crust & sauce (phenomenal)\n- 2 thai iced teas\nTotal: $47\n\nTheir flavors are pretty fan-freakin-tastic.

Very rich in flavors.\nTurnaround: Good. Neither slow or super fast.\nService: Good. Tea was always filled. \n\nWe ordered the special pork belly for the day, pad see ew, and coconut vermicelli. Hands-down the flavors were rich and plentiful with a lot of good complimenting so even though the pricing was a little more expensive than other Thai restaurants I have been to, I can live with that. The pork belly had soaked in a lot of the sauce it came in so each bite was amazing and the coconut vermicelli was refreshingly sweet with long unbroken strands. The pad see ew had tenderly cooked beef in a sauce that was not overly sweet, but they skimped on the vegetables. We also ordered a rice dessert that came with red beans and canned tangerines that was lightly sweetened and with sticky consistency. Very nice way of ending the meal~ The turnaround was average given that we came on a busy night, but not busy enough for a wait list so I shall count my blessings. Our server lady came often to refill our tea, but otherwise she was pretty quiet even though we tried to converse with her. She would simply smile and then walk away, which made me feel rejected, but that was not a big deal.", "author": "Jenny W."}

After two bites I called the waitress over and said the chicken was hard, tough and tasteless.  Definitely tasted as if it was frozen and defrosted with the sauce and served.  The other dish was just as tasteless and the meat was old, and tough, it was chicken!  We tried to figure out which dish was Curry and which was the other, we could not.  It was colored coconut milk.\nWhen a restaurant starts treating their clients like this, it means they are just concerned with the bottom line and not quality, or they are getting ready to sell and they do not care.\nIt was the last visit, won't be back.  There are too many good Thai restaurants in SF to put up with this type of service and food.  They could not wait to get rid of us.

It was not diluted or watered down so the consistency was just perfect. \n\nThe Tom yum was a little on the sour side, but I personally enjoyed it.

I hear the 9th location is roomier though if you have a bigger party.\n\nPer yelp's recommendation we ordered the Chan Pad Poo and also the pad thai and tom yum soup.  The Chan Pad Poo was actually really good, but too bad I didn't get to enjoy it all because my friend mistakenly thought it was her Pad Thai and had a healthy portion of it before she realized the mistake.  Chan Pad Poo is kind of like Pad Thai minus the shrimp and a bunch of the other ingredients but the flavor was different from Pad thai still.\n\nThe Angel Wings were good, spicy and saucy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-04", "description": "Coming into Marnee Thai, I expected quite a lot since it has high reviews on Yelp. And it was not a disappointment, but i was definitely not impressed also. \n\nWe came in early on Sunday for dinner, so we were seated right away. But right away, people started to wait outside in front of the restaurant. We had angel wings and satay chicken for appetizers. Angel wings were delicious, very flavorful and crispy on the outside. This is my favorite. Chicken satay was typical. What they had differently was the lettuce to wrap chicken with satay peanut sauce. At other restaurants, there are usually just the chicken skewers with sauce and pickles. \n\nWe ordered panang curry chicken, pad kee mao, mango fried rice, tofu eggplants for entrees. Panang Curry was different, and I didn't like it. It was served on a plate instead of a bowl. There were a lot of meat (chicken in this case) and very little of the curry part. I normally had Panang curry with majority of the curry, so I could pour curry over my rice (: But here at Marnee Thai, there was barely any curry for you. It was more like chicken saut\u00e9ed with curry sauce. Failed.  Pad Kee Mao was not as spicy as how Pad Kee Mao typically is, but I have no problem with it since I'm not a fan of super spicy. However, I would prefer the thicker & wider noodles. Mango fried rice- this is the first time I had mango fried rice. The fried rice is good but not OMG or WOW. The rice was not too dry or too mushy. It was perfectly cooked. The touch of mango gave the dish a special and unique flavor. Tofu eggplants - I thought this dish was only okay here. There were mostly eggplants and very few tiny pieces of tofu. The flavor is good. Another highlight of this restaurant is the dessert Roti Ice Cream. We've ordered Sticky Rice with Mango and Roti Ice Cream for desserts. The Mango Sticky Rice was very very good. But I almost always found this dessert at any Thai restaurant, and they always make it super good. For the Roti Ice Cream, this  is the first time I tried. It is actually a very clever combination. Fried crispy dough or \"roti\" sprinkled with some condensed milk and topped with vanilla ice cream. It is similar to fried ice cream. It is very different and very good. \n\nService was good. The restaurant is small so you can feel a lil cozy, but at the same time when it is full, it's a lil too packed.

So many little eateries.  Pretty much every other establishment is a restaurant.  \n\nOne of the many tasty restaurants on this stretch of \"New Chinatown\" is Marnee Thai. I came here for dinner a few nights ago, and I've been here a few times before, and from what I recall, it's always tasty.  \n\nIf Chef Siriyarn is the master of the kitchen, then Mrs. Siriyarn is certainly the heart of the restaurant.  She is such a presence, and it definitely reminds me of my (and maybe your) momma in all the expected ways - slightly annoying and in-your-face during implementation, but always well-intentioned and got your best interests at heart.  \n\nIt's a very nice, comfortable space (+1 for good atmosphere), very low-key and laid-back.  We sat down, and Mrs. Siriyarn gives us our menus.  She talks up a couple items and then leaves to give us time to decide.  There was a sea bass special that looked AMAZING with some type of mousse curry (That's what I recall, I could be wrong), and I was all over that, but then I read the fine print and saw that they only had it during weekends.  \n\nBOO.\n\nSo, I decided to go for the Woonsen Vegetarian, a silver noodle dish with vegetables, and my foodmate ordered the spicy pad thai with crab.  At this point, Mrs. Siriyarn sat down next to us (something I've never seen before) to take our orders.  I was a little taken aback that she just sat down so physically close to us and just kinda leans closely in, it seemed odd but at the same time, like I mentioned before, she's got a warm, momma presence, so you're okay with it.\n\nThe service was fast, the food came, and we dug in.  My foodmate's dish was spicy but delicious.  My own dish was a bit on the bland side, and I actually didn't enjoy it too much, but I think it was my own fault for ordering the wrong thing.  All my other experiences were fine. \n\nAt several points during the meal, Mrs. Siriyarn would pop up next to us (stealthy!) to check on us.  One time, my foodmate and I were having an especially personal conversation, and she popped up next to me - totally freaked me out!  Just like momma.

Bay Area, I really wanted to try this place.  I've had Thai food before at King of Thai,  I wanted to compare the taste, flavors, service, and atmosphere.  When we arrived, it was just us two and another couple.  By the time our food arrived at our table and when we left, all the seats were filled.\n\nTo start off, we ordered the Coconut Hotcakes and loved it very much.  It's 7 pieces of sizzling rice flour cakes with coconut milk, taro, and topped with corn ($7.95).  Highly recommended!\n\nNext, we ordered the traditional Pad Thai with shrimp and the Beef Fried Rice.  Both are delicious, the flavors are good and but not really for the price ($9.50 each).\n\nThe service wasn't all there.  When we ordered our food, we asked for the Hotcakes but the waiter went into the kitchen to see if they had it.  Instead of coming out of the kitchen whether or not they had it, he greeted customers coming in and seated them and then told us that they had hotcakes.  Instead of taking our complete order, he'd interrupt by seating other customers coming in.  There were two other waitresses working, so I was wondering why did they not seat customers so that our waiter could finish taking our order.  A waiter/waitress should focus on the customers on hand and have the others greet/take care of other customers.\n\nThe service was okay, our glasses were full even when we did not ask.  When we asked for the check, one of the waitresses took my credit card before providing me the bill. Luckily, the bill was correct.\n\nThe funny part is that just as I was placing my card and my copy into my wallet before I got up from my seat, the waitress said, \"Bye! Bye! Thank you!\"  I chuckled thinking, \"At least let me get up from my seat first before thanking us.\"", "author": "Allen C."}

The angel wings definitely struck a chord with many yelpers so we gave it a whirl.  A delicious, though messy, choice appetizer.  Deep-fried with a chili-garlic sauce smothered over the wings and finally topped with crisply fried basil.  The wings were served piping hot and each wing was rather sizeable.\n\nThe noodle we ordered was just as delicious.  An ever-so \"healthy-for-the heart\" combination of rice noodle, crab meat, and egg.  We ordered medium spiciness, I could have ordered up a notch for that extra kick.  The string beans were a good choice for our vegetable for the night.  I feel like you can never go wrong with string beans. They were flavorful and sauteed to the proper crispness, served with tofu and baby corn.\n\nThe service is interesting.  The main \"momma\" server had a very boisterous personality.

You can drive by a billion times and never take notice of this gem on Irving.\n\nGolden Triangles (Thai Samosas): Crispy on the outside, curried potato chunks on the inside. The absolute perfect few bites to wet your palette. These delicious triangles come with the perfect dipping sauce, too.\n\nPad Kee Mao with Pork: The pork LOOKS dry, but it really isn't. Perfect amount of spice for this delicate dish. I ate everything that was edible on this plate, including the garnish. Yeah, it was that delicious.\n\nTom Yum Soup with noodles: The best part about this dish is that they have this item on the special lunch menu and it's cheap and very pleasing. It's the perfect sourness. You can taste the lemongrass and all the other herbs that went into this soup.\n\nMango with Sticky Rice: OH. MY. GAHHHH. This is the best ending to a meal. They will never serve an under-ripe mango because each time I've ordered this dish, the mangoes have been sinfully sweet. The coldness of the fruit balances out the warm sticky rice topped with a coconut milk sauce. I can probably just have the coconut milk sauce by itself, it's so yummy. The sticky rice is perfectly made.\n\nService is great. Everyone is extremely helpful and nice. The restaurant is a bit small, but I've never had to wait for a table before.

Then there's the food which is totally ridiculous. Our party of 4 was all vegan and almost everything on the huge menu was available to us. Friends had said this was the best Thai in SF and we agree. It's also the most FUN Thai restaurant ever!!!! Can't wait to go again.", "author": "Michael N."}

This location is run by a matron named May, she is a bit of a psychic and will gladly analyze your tendencies, strong  vibes and so on.

No limes, I have seen too many places cutting corners on the limes for this dish. I think it is essential. We ordered two (one shrimp, one chicken) The shrimp came first, but before the chicken came...\nThe waiter mixed up our order for lamb and gave us another table's order instead of ours ( noodles w/ Duck) . When we brought it up, they just said they would just not give us the chicken pad thai to cancel the mess-up out. That was not fair because now we didn't get our lamb dish OR our pad Thai dish.  We ended up having to order our original dish again.\nBut the duck dish we received was tasty! what ever it was.\n\nPraram Phak - A peanut curry dish - the curry was too thin, and the vegetables were lacking in flavor.\nPumpkin Curry - The curry was too thin, and the dish was overall bland.\nfor a Thai place they need ramp up the flavor on the curries.\n\nPanang Beef; It had the cumin & the flavors were there.\n\nDessert:\nFried Banana and Ice Cream - good but not melting in your mouth great like I have had at other Thai restaurants.\n\nAt the end of the night, they charged us for 2 more beers and 3 more ice teas than we actually ordered. When we pointed this out to them, they revised the check, but the revised check still had 1 ice tea and 1 beer more than we ordered. They got it right on the third try (originally the check was $166, and that was lowered to $140 when we got the correct check).For 5 the price is fine, especially with beer-.\n\nWe have visited many Thai places, and love Thai food, but this one was a real disappointment in terms of food and messy in terms of service.

We were a table of 3 and the restaurant was nearly empty (2 other tables of 2).  Staff (4 servers visible) were at most points sitting enjoying their overflowing plates while we were surprised how small each entree we ordered was.  OK, simple math - 7 people dining, 4 employees... bad service shouldn't even be an issue but it was.  After the soup, 3 entrees and tiny portion of mango rice, we ordered more.  We came there to eat, enjoy and feel satisfied.  We ate, we didn't enjoy and we weren't exactly satisfied.\n\nNo owner or manager was present (yes I discreetly asked) and when I mentioned to our waited that it was my Mother's birthday dinner and I actually chose to dine there out of several other fantastic options, my disappointment was met with confused looks shot over from the other waitress listening to our hallway conversation.  Suddenly we had water and the service became almost annoyingly overbearing for the last 5 minutes.  They obviously were trying hard but we felt like it was a little too late. You guys should consider that everyone who walks in your door is money. This thing called customer service: it starts from the first moment, not the last.\n\n1 star because it's obligatory and 1/2 extra star for them trying to redeem their aloofness with a birthday song and gong for Mom.  \n\nRounded up to a 2 star experience though you're off my list because dropping over $70 (*without any drinks, mind you) on Thai food wasn't worth it here.

But, apparently, as with my love for the boy that I went to Marnee Thai with went away, so has my love for their food. . . \n\nAfter a super long hiatus of grubbing on what I had previously thought was one of the most awesome Thai places in town, I returned for a casual meal with 2 friends and my new beau (ok not so new, but new relative to the boy I no longer love).  Sadly, the quality of the food has gone down hill, and now they're just a mediocre Thai place that's just as good as, but no better than the King of Thai restaurants. \n\nThe angel wings, once the highlight of my meal, are no longer smothered in the oh-so-delicious sauce. Sure it's tossed in the sauce, but it's nothing like before, when there was so much sauce that any holes between the succulent wings were covered.  Now there's not enough sauce, and they're just plain old wings. \n\nThe Pad Kee Mao was also a disappointment. It was overly sweet. Where's the spice? Where's the kick? Marnee Thai is still a Thai place afterall, right? \n\nThen there was the bland bland Thai Fried Rice. Again, no spice, no kick :( The only tasty thing was the pineapples, which I'm sure came from a can. \n\nSigh . . . I'll mourn the loss of Marnee Thai longer than I did the lost love for that boy, who I really didn't love that much, but that's besides the point. \n\nI guess, the positive point to end of was that their Roti with Coconut Ice Cream is still superb.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-14", "description": "I went to Marnee Thai while visiting San Francisco this past Sunday evening with my boyfriend. We were meeting my sister and her family, but we got there early and held a table while we waited. We were lucky to get there when we did (at 6PM) because we only had to wait for about 3 minutes to be seated; shortly thereafter, there was a line out the door!\n\nWe sat down and ordered appetizers while we waited. We had the chicken satay wraps and the summer rolls. The summer rolls were delicious, but they had more rice noodle in them that I would have liked (usually I like more vegetable); however, they were fresh and tasty overall. The satay was great--it was unique in that they were wraps (served with big leaves of butter lettuce, bean sprouts and cold rice noodles), which made it fun!\n\nWhen my sister arrived, it turned out that she had brought more people than expected, so we had to change tables in this very crowded restaurant. The head waitress accommodated us, but not without letting us know what an inconvenience it was. She was a bit abrasive, but had complete control over the situation, which we appreciated.\n\nWhen the waitress took our order, it was a bit chaotic (to say the least). We had some questions, but she didn't give us time to ask them; instead, we were rushed through and some of us were even passed over as she skipped immediately to the table next to us. It was pretty odd, and left us dazed and confused.\n\nFor additional appetizers, our group shared the coconut hot cakes, which had been recommended to us by a friend of my sister's. They looked like deviled eggs and came hot off the griddle, topped with some corn kernels, ham, and some sauce. They were pretty tasty, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our entrees (and the line outside was growing longer), we saw May (Marnee) enter the restaurant and take complete control. She walked from table to table like she owned the place, and indeed! She does! Quite a presence.\n\nOur food arrived in a completely arbitrary order--obviously they just brought it out as it was ready. There was no room on the table for all the dishes, and we were already squeezed so tight into our table that it was not that pleasant. Meanwhile, Marnee was taking orders and yelling to her staff across the room. Again, we were a bit bewildered!\n\nThe food itself was okay. I had the chicken larb gai salad, which I almost always order when I go to Thai restaurants, and it was not the best I've had. The mint/cilantro/lime flavors were delicious, but the ground chicken meat was not the best quality. My beau had the pad see ew, which he says was uninspired. The other members of our party seemed to enjoy their roast duck and sea bass, but I didn't get a good description from them because the atmosphere was not at all conducive to conversation.\n\nWe were stuffed and ready to go (in fact, one of our waitresses was bringing us the bill), when Marnee/May alit on our table like hawk. She told us that her roti dessert was amazing, and insisted that we order it. In fact, it was impossible to refuse; what a businesswoman! The dessert was just fried dough with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I didn't care for it and it tasted like oil, but the 12 year old in our group scarfed it down.\n\nFinally, we squeezed our way out of our tight table configuration. Obviously the place is popular, because it was brimming with enthusiastic diners, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Perhaps if it had been less chaotic it would have been a more pleasant experience, but this was a bit much. We were afraid to ask questions and felt forced to order a dessert that we didn't want, and unable to order the things we did want. However, if you do go, make sure to either make a reservation or go a bit early.\n\n(Also, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting; the floor and the toilet seat wwere completely wet, and I don't really want to know what they were wet from, and the garbage can was overflowing with paper towels.

It was a hot evening and people just poured out from GG park after watching a band.\n\nLet's start with positive notes. \n* The wait was about 30 mn even though there was a long line. Luckily, we came early. The hostess tried very hard to sit everyone. There was a couple who had a reservation. They were going to walk away but the hostess talked them into staying. \n* Nice gesture: My sister just had a surgery, They brought out a chair for her to sit.\n* The drinks and the food came pretty quickly. \n* Service was fine considering the chaos. \n* The hostess came to our table and took our order within a few mn.  I did not have a chance to study the menu so I felt a bit rushed.\n* She made some recommendations to help us out.\n\nNegative notes. \n* Even though people had reservations, those who were there before us and did not have reservations got seated before us. \n* If you want a quiet dinner, don't go to Marnee whether the one on Irving or on 9th as they are always busy.\n* They forgot one of our appetizers\n* I returned my plate as it was not quite clean. Never got a replacement.\n* My husband did not get a napkin. They brought paper napkin when we asked for one.\n* The place was so small, after people sat around us, there was no space for the waiters or waitresses to pass through so a few things got passed over to us over people. \n* We are Asian. We eat out almost every weekend. We have been to many Thai restaurants from SF to the Peninsula which is where we live. I remember enjoying the food at Marnee on 9th more than last night. I don't think I had anything last night that I would come back for. That's why I gave a two stars meaning exactly what it says \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"\n\nI am glad they are busy. When we left, there was a line of people waiting. They are accommodating and working very hard. That was definitely quite a night for us.", "author": "Nga C."}

I'll remember this place for three good reasons:  1) being just a block away from where I lived, you could smell the fantastic aroma of basil, chilies and garlic as soon as you stepped outside. 2) shoving Defense Secretary Leon Panetta away from the door after four repeated \"excuse me\" (the guy is a jerk and I didn't care who he was!). 3) most important, consistently serving up some of the finest Thai dishes I've ever had.  Chef Chai's cooking is Da Bomb!  \n\nIf you don't mind the owner...I think her name is May - yelling at the workers, telling you what to order and trying to read your palm, then you're good.  BTW, she told me that I'd have many lovers and be married multiple times.  Gulp!  Anyway, my favorites there:\n\nSpicy chicken w. Thai basil\nYen ta four soup\nPo tak soup\nRoasted duck noodles\nKao rad kang w. pork\nPad thai -- best in SF!\nImperial rolls\nKang keaw w. pork\nBasa fish w. mushroom and Thai herbs\nMango w. sticky rice\nPad prig khing w. pork\nBeef satay\nTod mun -- excellent!\nBeef salad\nKang ka ree w. chicken\n\nYum!  Yes, I dealt with the long lines to eat at this place quite often.  The prices for the quality of the dishes were very reasonable and I always felt the service there was good although I'm aware they've often received mixed reviews.  And there are a couple of dishes I think were a tad better at other places - Osha Thai and Thep Phenam come to mind.  But I still think the overall quality of the food here is the best.  \n\nMost of the locals have tried this place.  I think it will be a wonderful discovery and pleasant experience for visitors!  Just be sure not to let May tell you what to order unless you ask.  And don't let her read your palm.  You might not want to know what she has to tell you. :)", "author": "Andrew K."}

I went to the Irving Street location and did get it there. \n\nBut they do run out of it on occasions. One time I went there, they had run out of it. So I had to make a second trip there.

It's certainly my go-to, whether it's a road trip pit stop or whipping up a quick pad thai for dinner. After visiting Thailand for a few weeks with my wife two summers ago, we've been on the lookout for places that provide some of the regional varieties that we had around the country, and Marnee delivers on that. \n\nHaving just gotten the keys for our new house on 23rd, I wanted to grab some takeout in the new neighborhood. Thai being our goto, and with the great ratings Marnee gets on Yelp, it was a no-brainer to give them a try. I saw some shout-outs for the spicy angel wings, so I ordered some of those, and the pad nor mai sounded a lot like the spicy ground chicken street food that we love. I finished it off with some Mussamun  curry. It was all piping hot when we opened it up in our empty living room, and it smelled delicious. \n\nThe wings were still too hot to touch, but I risked singed fingers to give them a try -- they were sweet, too sweet for my wife's taste in fact, and reasonably spicy. I thought they were delicious, but I was hoping for a bit more kick. \n\nThe pad nor mai was nothing like the dish we were expecting, but it was fantastic all the same! We were expecting something more like Burma Superstar's mint chicken, but this had bigger chunks of chicken and lots of bamboo shoots -- and the perfect mix of chiles, garlic and basil to tie it together.\n\nMy favorite dish was the Mussamun curry -- the potatoes give it an earthiness that mixes well with the coconut curry. They nailed this dish so well that I might have trouble ordering anything else from them in the future.\n\nThe only drawback was that they took a bit longer than expected to finish my order. Fortunately, I wasn't in any hurry, so I got to hang out in the back of the restaurant and watch the line cooks prepare the dishes.", "author": "Joel Y."}

We ordered the Harmok, potstickers, fresh spring rolls and the Tom Kha soup, all of which were tasty. We decided to take the mango with sticky rice to go. Upon arriving at home, I open up the box and what do I find?! Yes, a strand of hair in the coconut sauce for the rice. \n\nBottom line, although the food was good, it is not the most convenient location and the hygiene needs some work. Although the staff was attentive, the owner is WAY too pushy. If I am already here eating at your restaurant, you don't have to tell me that every dish is wonderful and delicious.

Also good is the Pad Prig Khing, the pork with green beans.  I have not seen another Thai restaurant in SF or the Bay Area, which serves this type of Angel Wings or the Chan Pad Poo.  The Angel Wings are chicken wings deep fried and marinated with lots and lots of garlic and basil in a sweet spicy sauce; goes great with steamed rice.  The Corn Cakes are flat, deep fried corn fritters, served with a cucumber salad and a sweet spicy dressing.  The Chan Pad Poo is noodles with egg and crabmeat, with just the right amount of spiciness.  I converted over to this dish from Pad Thai.  And the Mango with Sticky Rice here is so good, better than most.\r\n\r\nI tend to stick with the tried and true.  I have sampled other dishes, but not as often, and cannot remember them all.

So long that I don't remember eating there! What happened? Why didn't I come back? Probably because I lived in a different part of the city and didn't venture out to the sunset? \n\nWell, now that I am calling the neighborhood home again, we decided to give Marnee Thai a shot. This was our second time ordering take-out. We have yet to eat-in the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered a lot of different dishes this time: \n\n--papaya salad\n--summer rolls (basically spring rolls with a different name)\n--green curry dumplings (I'm gluten-intolerant; my husband ate these)\n--pad kee mao (sp?)\n--pumkin curry \n--panang beef curry (I didn't eat this, as it looked thickened with flour)\n--mussaman curry  (I also didn't eat this)\n\nAs I mentioned, I'm gluten-intolerant so I ate the items that I felt comfortable eating. I\"m pretty sure the food was not 100% gluten free but for the most part, no issues.  The papaya salad was a great starter and not too sweet or sticky, as I've had at other places. The summer rolls are great. I had a tiny bit of peanut sauce (although it's usually not gluten-free) and it was yum. The summer rolls come in 2's and are fairly large. Each roll is about twice as long as spring/summer rolls I have seen elsewhere!\n\nThe pumpkin curry was delicious! My absolute favorite. I've had it elsewhere and this is as good or better here. I love that they add peas to the curry. I didn't expect it to come with tofu. The tofu is fried which also is not my favorite, but it was ok. (I'm not sure if their fried tofu is gluten free? but I chanced it...)\n\nI also chanced it and had the Pad Kee Mao since they were rice noodles. It's possible the spicy sauce they use may contain gluten. It was delicious but I may stick to curries in the future to be safe.\n\nMy husband enjoyed the other dishes also. We will definitely be back. Wish they delivered for those lazy nights, but it's not so bad picking up. The only problem is that it is usually very crowded on Friday nights, so try to order early or come when you know the food will already be done. Otherwise you will be waiting in a small space by the door where tons of people are coming in and going out.  The service is not as friendly either as I saw for people dining in...the girl who worked there had me wait in the drafty hallway by the kitchen.  That is why I'm knocking off one star.", "author": "Rosie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-13", "description": "How do I preface the, Marnee Thai review?\n\nI'm not inclined to write reviews about places I've been to on dates (because (a) humble bragging, although \"so in\" for 2013, is obnoxious, and (b) just plain old bragging about dates is tacky).  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you, Yelpers of America?  Someone takes you out for a nice night, and you rip the establishment a new one on a website because, why?  (You want to get invited to Yelp Elite parties, and must accumulate records of your gastronomy to do so?  You need people to vote that what you ordered is \"cool\" and validate your disdain for something you experienced?  You have an urge to let it be known you're still here, still dining about town, still having opinions worth sharing?)  I think dissecting your date on the Internet, and on a site as impersonal and pessimistic as Yelp can be, is the epitome of criticism, commercialism, and our addiction to attention on social media.  And on a more personal level: don't you want to maintain some semblance of privacy in what should be some of your best, more intimate endeavors?  I just... I don't understand.  Like I said, it's tacky.\n\nYikes... Cool story already, bro.  I'm not sure where that rant came from.  Forgive me, Marnee Thai.  You deserve better, and nothing but the sweetest of reviews.\n\nBut I suppose in the city of bandwagoning (say hello to my Giants shirt, Spring 2013), I'll jump on here, take a turn for hypocrisy, and talk about a place where dates may've been had, and explain why I want to talk about it on Yelp.  \n\nWhat I want to say is: Marnee Thai is a pretty nice place for a date.  Hear me out: I'm specifically thinking about a date for the couple who has been seeing each other for a little bit.  Things are getting comfortable, but still exciting.  You're beginning to introduce each other to friends.  You're spending more time together.  You're still learning.  Go on.  \n\nYou want to have a dinner together, and are content to go out to the Sunset (not necessarily known for its night life?) for a quiet, quality meal and time together.  You know you might have to wait to be seated, which might mean standing very, very close to each other near the doorway.  The dining room is pretty small, so there's going to be more closeness to come once seated (and the question: will you be that couple who sits side-by-side (don't) or across from each other?).  You can bring your own wine too, which is such a date-y thing to do.  Look at that, it's already shaping up to be a good date night.    \n\nWhat's special here is the woman who runs the place (I want to say her name is May, and not just because that rhymes; but forgive me, for I don't actually remember?).  She'll come to your table and make you feel like family.  And just like a wise aunt, she'll let you know what she thinks about the prospect of your budding relationship.  She'll make you believe her kind words, because she's a kind woman who is excellent at reading people.  Or so she says.  Or so she leads you to believe.  Or so you want to believe, because you just like it here in the warm little dining room of Marnee Thai so much.  It feels like a rite of passage in a new relationship to experience such a special interaction with a stranger.  She lights up the place, and leaves you with a warm little buzz (or it's from the wine you brought, maybe - but she'll definitely contribute to your fond experience here).\n\nI'm not saying you have to go.  I'm just saying...  think about it.  And we know the food is great.  Maybe later you don't have to regurgitate what you ordered later and comment on the service; just let it live on as a precious little memory, eh?\n\nSpeaking of: on the food front, while I tend to think people are completely capable of ordering for themselves, I do want to rave about one item in particular.  The soft-shell crab green mango salad.  It's heavenly.  Since you're already on a date yourself, let your taste buds in on the action, and experience the love of this dish.  I think I can promise, you won't regret it.  Shit, if you do want to come on here and gush about its magnificence yourself, go for it.  Let this, all of this, come from a place of love, a place of raves, not rants, a place of building up, not breaking down.  \n\nMay the force be with you, young lovers.", "author": "Keeks K."}

I have been to this restaurant about 2 times now. The first time was pretty nice, we got a red curry with duck, samosas, pad thai, brown rice. Everything was pretty good and I was content. \n\nHowever the SECOND time I went there, it was pretty disappointing , service was very slow and cups of water smelled and tasted like bleach. Disgusting. We ordered 2 pad thais, 1 other seafood noodle and one curry with seafood with brown rice.\n\nThey bought my dish with white rice and I kindly told them to fix it, but the server was rude, grabbed the plate and came back to tell me that they had no more brown rice. She didnt even offer make sure if it was okay for the customer. Then we waited for second pad thai to come for like 30 minutes, but it never came. The server said it was coming, but then still it didnt arrive- had to ask again and turns out they only put in one order of pad thai. By then everyone had already gotten their dishes so we just canceled the order. My family was irritated.\n\nThe pad thai was a little too sweet, and the other dish supposedly cooked with crab tasted identical, and the green curry this time with seafood was horrible, I got a whole bowl  of just red bell peppers and bamboo shoots with like one piece of  meat. Sad sad sad....\n\nThe place is pretty cramped. The service can be slow and depending on the your server could be iffy. The food is pricy , but normal range for thai food.

The 1st time, I had a seafood curry of some sort with fish, and me and my dining partner shared the appetizers of chicken wings. (This was my \"pre-pescatarian\" diet that I'm currently on.\" The curry was perfect, and warmed the heart (and the sweat glands) with a zing of spice. The wings, OMG, were divine. You will have to ask for extra napkins and then a few more because WOW are those suckers covered in the delicious Thai-something glaze. The thai iced tea was good, sweet, and I wanted more of it.\n\nThis time around, there were 5 in our group and they seated us promptly for our 8pm reservation. [Tip: make a reservation - they honor them and will save you time.] We decided to go family style this time and ordered 5 dishes for the table. I can't comment on the beef-stir fry (#41, I think) or the pork dish from the special menu, but I did enjoy the shrimp pad thai, pumpkin tofu curry, and the seafood curry.\n\nThe pad thai was fairly standard, but in my opinion overly sweet and low in shrimp content. A few extra peanuts and a few more Thai-spices could have made this pad thai better. I go off on a limb and say you should try something else on their menu before resorting for their pad thai.\n\nThe pumpkin tofu curry was delicious. Do know that it's Asian pumpkin, not carve -it-on-your-porch-in-October pumpkin, which makes sense, but I didn't realize that after a long week. We ordered it mild (yellow) because the spice-tolerance in my group is low, but I would have preferred at least medium to give more of a delicious kick. The tofu was great, and the curry, poured over rice, made for a savory combination.\n\nThe seafood curry was pretty good as well, with large pieces of shrimp, scallops, and egg. While the curry was good, I thought the egg, which was probably thrown-in too early, created a strange texture of liquid-y curry + small fine chunks of egg. Flavour was great though!\n\nOverall, this is a solidly \"Thai-rrific\" four-star Thai place.  Make a reservation, come hungry, leave satisfied, and try the candy they give you once to see if you like it. It's a strange taste that lasted only 3 seconds in my mouth before it spent the rest of its life in my napkin.", "author": "Eric H."}

The fried crispy basil leaves are a nice complement to the dish.\n\n* Beef Satay - Thinly sliced pieces of tasty, marinated beef on a skewer which can be topped with the flavorful peanut sauce.  No complaints for being greasy since the beef is lean and tender.  A favorite!\n\nEntrees:\n\n* Pad Thai - The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted.  The noodles are just the right chewy consistency and the flavor is perfect with it's level of sweetness.  Again, no puddles of grease here.\n\n* Pad Kaprow - You have a choice of chicken minced pork, roasted duck or prawns/calamari.  I always order the minced pork that's sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basil.  The flavor is so distinct and blends so perfectly with the white rice.  Another favorite of mine!\n\nDessert:\n\n* Roti with Ice Cream - A thin deep fried piece of dough shaped like a flat disk that's drizzled generously with a sugary sauce and topped with a delicious scoop of coconut ice cream.  The dough is fried to a chewy consistency and when enjoyed with a bit of the ice cream . . . heaven!\n\nMarnee Thai is always a great choice for Thai food.  The prices are reasonable, the location has adequate parking and the food is delicious.  The service can be a little rushed at times because they get busy, so be sure to make reservations especially on the weekends.  I've also tried the other location which is just as good.", "author": "Karen L."}

We mindlessly drove around without a real destination or idea of what to eat. Somehow we found parking on Irving St. (score!) near a Japanese restaurant, but I decided to Yelp it first. I couldn't find the name of the restaurant (it wasn't really visible from the street), but Marnee Thai came up with great reviews, and it was just down the block. \n\nI loved the interior decor! Walls were decorated floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall with bamboo-like material. It made you feel like you were in a cozy hut. Wait staff were well-dressed with their Thai-style dresses or shirts. I almost felt bad coming in here with sweaty workout clothes =(. But they welcomed us with a smile and seated us right away. \n\nWe started with the Angel Wings substituted with tofu. Wow! If their special sweet and spicy sauce can make tofu taste this good, I can only imagine what the chicken wings taste like! And the decorative fried basil was a nice touch.\n\nThe rest of our meal came out almost immediately. We ordered the chicken with string beans in chili paste and sauteed eggplant with tofu (the bf LOVES fried tofu. Actually, he likes anything fried!), both of which were indicated as spicy on the menu.\n\nThe chicken with string beans was cooked just right with slightly crunchy string beans and bite-size chicken slices. The chili paste gave the dish a great flavor, but made it a little oily. The eggplant dish was tasty as well. However, neither dish had any spice to them! Maybe I wasn't loud or clear enough when I told the fast-speaking waitress \"spicy.\" Or maybe I missed something she said when she was taking our order? I forget - my rumbling stomach was starting to take over my body, who knows what I said.\n\nAs we finished our meal, the place was starting to fill up at 7pm on a Saturday night. It's a small restaurant and the tables are so close together you might as well be sharing your meal with your neighboring diners. But the food is authentic and worth the coziness. Just make sure you speak up when you indicate \"spicy\" for your dish.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

I love the food here, after coming countless times, it's safe to say that the food is always delicious. I tend to be pretty predictable when I come here; I usually come to Marnee for a curry fix. I've tried a variety of the curries and I've enjoyed them all for the most part, any complaints would be too little meat in a couple that I've had. The green curry is great if you want something spicy, red if you want something mild, and the yellow is great for a heartier feel. It's nice that they have 3 different meat choices (beef, pork or chicken), a choice for prawns, and a vegetarian option (generally tofu, which is still delicious), so at least with the curries, you could have it go pretty much your way. \n\nGenerally when I go with my family or a group of friends we order the chicken satay (the peanut sauce is TO DIE FOR) and another appetizer, usually the Golden Triangles which are like samosas filled with a curried sweet potato mixture, which are also amazing. \n\nThe service is friendly, and pretty vigilant (filling your water glass when it runs low, or promptly coming over if signaled). The pricing is reasonable for the portions, and the food is generally very good. Highly recommended.\n\nOne thing though, if you have peanut allergies, I wouldn't recommend coming here.

It was mediocre.  \n     I do give a thumbs up for the spicy angel wings though, it seems that with many thai restaurants there is an inconsistency in their angel wings.  Some thai restaurants serve the stuffed chicken wings and name it angel wings, however the angel wings here are the style that i love. Fried then stirred in a sweet and spicy sauce with a load of minced garlic and topped off with fried basil leaves.  Very tasty. \n   All in all, the service here was very good which is why i gave this place 3 stars, I wouldn't mind giving this place another try, maybe i'll heed to the advice of fellow yelpers on what dishes to order next time.", "author": "Elway K."}

However, after the waitress frantically killed a COCKROACH on our table... I don't think I'll be going there again. I know that restaurants have their share of... problems, but... I don't want to see cockroaches running around the dinner table, especially AFTER we were finished eating. Was it hanging out on the bottom of one of our plates? Did it catch a ride on the waitress? Seriously, where the heck did it come from?! GROSS. Offering a free dessert doesn't make it right either. We paid our bill and left.\n\nAlso, I agree with a previous yelper about the pushy and loud owner. There were 4 of us in my party. We ordered iced coffees, 2 appetizers and 3 entrees, thinking it was plenty of food. However the owner insisted that we order another dish. W-T-H! I was more than a little annoyed with her. \n\nIt was a terrible way to start the meal, and the cockroach running around the table was just the cherry on top.

What I liked the most was the curry and their stir fry dishes in their house chili sauce. I have to say, since my trip to Southeast Asia and having a taste of many curry and stir fry dishes, Marnee Thai is the only one that brings me back to those flavors. I've had both red and green curries so far, and both are very flavorful. It's also has a good portion of meat and veggies so it's not just a order of curry sauce. Unlike many Thai restaurants, they have a very good selection of stir fry dishes, curries, and noodles.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here when I'm in the city.", "author": "Stephy Y."}

So then onto the food:\n\nAppetizers:\nWe started with the Spicy Angel Wings which was the best dish all night.\nGreen Mango Salad- which was a solid interesting mango/prawn combination. \nTom Kha - Again, solid, but nothing memorable. \n\nEntrees: \nPad Thai - Just okay, again, nothing special.  We ordered two (one shrimp, one chicken) The shrimp came first, but before the chicken came...\nThe waiter mixed up our order for lamb and gave us another table's order instead of ours. When we brought it up, they just said they would just not give us the chicken pad thai to cancel the mess-up out. We didnt think that was fair because now we didnt get our lamb dish OR our pad Thai dish.  We ended up having to order our original dish again. \nBut the duck dish we received was tasty!\nPraram Phak - A peanut curry dish whos curry was too thin, and whos vegetables were lacking in flavor.\nPumpkin Curry - Again, the curry was too thin, and the dish was overall bland.\n\nDessert:\nFried Banana and Ice Cream - the banana was not hard, not soft as it should be in my opinion, and the ice cream lacking in flavor. \n\nAt the end of the night, they charged us for 2 more beers and 3 more ice teas than we actually ordered. When we pointed this out to them, they revised the check, but the revised check still had 1 ice tea and 1 beer more than we ordered. They got it right on the third try (originally the check was $166, and that was lowered to $140 when we got the correct check).\n\nI've been to quite a few Thai places, and I love Thai food, but this one was sub par in terms of food and messy in terms of service. Maybe it was a bad night, which excuses the service problems, but the food, well that doesnt really change from night to night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-22", "description": "This just became my favorite Thai place.  After having lived in northern Thailand for over three years I have long searched for a Thai restaurant in the U.S. that serves a lot of the dishes that I miss and do it without losing the flavor.  Marnee Thai has done that and more.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nSome of the unique dishes you MUST try are the Morning Glory (it's vegan too!).  That was a staple while I lived in Thailand and was absolutely delicious last night.  There are actually some ascetic Buddhist monks who live on only morning glory... or so I'm told.  Not sure how they do that...\n\nAlso the Kao Pote Tawt (corn fritters -- also vegan) are hard to find elsewhere and were pretty good.  They didn't have as much flavor as I remember but they were nice and crispy so they must have hot oil.\n\nNext are the \"kah-nome kroke\".  I can't remember what they called them on the menu... maybe coconut and rice crispy patties / pancakes or something like that?  They don't look exactly like they do in Thailand but they definitely nailed the flavor.  These are little coconut fritters with green onions, corn and coconut cream served on top.  They consist of flour, sugar, and coconut, so they're basically like a dessert.  The Thais usually eat them as a snack in the morning.  These are also vegan, by the way.\n\nThe soy protein salad (make sure to tell them no fish sauce if you want it vegan) was very tasty.  We also ordered the vegetarian samosas (vegan), which are not Thai but were very good.  I've not seen either of these dishes at other Thai restaurants.\n\nThe Hanglay curry is not vegan (might be able to be made so -- I didn't ask) but is an authentic northern Thai dish that I've not seen anywhere else.  If you want to try something different, this is a good one to try.\n\nFinally, another one for the non-vegans, is the Haw Mok.  This is a delicious egg / coconut / meat and curry souffle served inside a banana leaf.  It's pretty incredible and hard to find at other Thai places.\n\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nThey take reservations and large parties (we had 9 in ours).\n\nThe seating is pretty tight.  It's a small little restaurant and everyone is packed together pretty tight.  I didn't mind, but if you are claustrophobic or are looking for something a little more quiet and private, this is not the place.\n\nThe owner is probably one of the highlights of this place.  She is loud and definitely let's you know she runs the show, but she's also very sweet.  We did a birthday party and she got everyone in the restaurant to sing for our friend.  We gave one of our cupcakes to the spirit of the restaurant as good luck, at her recommendation, which brought back fond memories of doing this in Thailand.\n\nShe also told all of our fortunes.  She seemed to have a pretty good knack for reading personalities or at least telling an entertaining story.  It made for a great night.  I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Peter O."}

First of all, this is not the best Thai food i ever had, there are many others in the city that taste equally good or much better.  Second, the service is just ridiculously rude and despite their business longevity, they still haven't master a good management and customer services skill.\n\nThings that bothers me:\n\n1. super bossy boss lady,  apparently this is a common thing ppl feel, i am not the only one.  Boss lady always recommend WAY too much then you really need, having  their customers to \"over-order\" is common good strategy,  but somehow \"Boss-marnee thai\" is super good and never shy about speak-out in this area!   And if you are too nice and are the kind who tend to easily get manipulated, you will end up having left over of today's dinner, tomorrow's lunch and dinner. So be careful!!\n\n2. reservation means NOTHING, don't bother, and always be prepared to be ignored walk-in.  And many times, they will swap you around so that they can accommodate other guests (so they can seat more ppl, maximize their profit!) i personally think they put way too much seats in the restaurant, the the space is so tight, i sometimes actually feel sorry of \"boss-manee thai\", cuz for her to walk/ and serve through the restarant must be  a close to a \"mission impossible \"!!  I just cannot see how would be possible for her NOT to knock down couple of things on the table here and there.\n\n3. Make sure you are SUPER familiar and STUDY their dishes,  if you ordered something, and it came out to be wrong.  you either take it or be prepared to take her rudeness....  And make sure NOT to touch the dish before returning, if you suspect dish is wrong, but accidentally touched it, then its your fault!!!  b/c Lady boss would asked you\" why you touch it???\"  i do not know that's her motive for asking that stupid question:  first of all how the hell  would you know this is not right, if you didn't try it.  and secondly, why are you so \"mad\" and rude about the wrong dish if you are the ones made mistake?  should you be apologetic about it instead of asking me such a rude question?   are you gonna serve this to someone else if i haven't touched it???? is that why?? \n\n\nAnyways..... bye bye marnee thai.. good luck with your sucking service...i am going somewhere else!!!", "author": "Jasmin Y."}

Way too much food for one person but felt obliged to agree to her suggestion as I was putting them out being it was closing time. The restaurant was still full and people seemed to be enjoying the ambience: young, trendy and very SF.\n\nThe summer rolls were not so special to write home about, mostly cucumber, bean sprouts, lettuce, not sure there was any shrimp in them as I did not see any.

Noodles, sauces, good. \n\nThe older lady was talking to her helpers in Thai language the whole time I was sitting at my table eating.  It was both distracting and rude.

(Personally Jitlada in J-Town will always be my favorite, but I digress).  My mom's motto, at a restaurant, seems to be the more the merrier, because she always more than enough food.  And with Marnee's teeny-tiny tables, the plates overrunneth.  \n\nThe Spicy Angel Wings and Pad Thai are always a must when we dine here, and they NEVER disappoint.  I'm practically licking the plate clean afterward.  \n\nThis last visit we also enjoyed the Green Papaya Salad - which was divine, the Green Curry with chicken - also yummy, and Basa Fillet with garlic and black pepper sauce (you get a choice of sauces), which was very tasty, but the fillet was too small for my liking.  Although we were stuffed, my family always makes room for dessert, and we had the white sticky rice with mango - I could eat this by the gallon.\n\nIt's best to enjoy the food and try not to have too personal a conversation, since the tables are practically on top of each other.

The servers at Marnee Thai seem to have a system of going and crossing, since there are really only two aisles from which they can walk through to get to their tables.  Regardless, service was friendly and efficient.\n\nI would give this restaurant a 5-star if it weren't for the occasional claustrophobia I feel when I dine here, or the fact that when you have to wait for a table, the space is very limited and you're regulated to standing outside, usually in very cold weather.

They were not HUGE tables either so I didn't see why they wouldn't just give it to us. 20 minutes and going, more people came in.  They seated everyone but US!

I'd say it's a bit better than the King of Thai Noodle chains, but still lacking when compared with Siam Kitchen. \n\nI tried the pad thai, pad see ewe, yellow curry with chicken, mango fried rice and homemade hotcakes. \n\nPad thai: I don't really enjoy pad thai anywhere else except at Siam Kitchen because every other single place I've tried, including Marnee Thai, makes it overly sweet and sour and wet (as in too much sauce). Whereas at Siam Kitchen, pad thai is flavorful, not dry and not wet, and just excellent.\n\nPad see ewe: The pad see ewe was done really well. The noodles were just the right texture (not too chewy and not too soft) and the flavor was right. The only thing I would suggest is to not bother ordering it with any meat and just get vegetarian. I ordered it with 'pork' but basically just got two pieces of it; they put a lot of tofu in there. \n\nYellow curry with chicken: My favorite dish out of the four that I ordered. Because it was a mild curry it was just the right spicyness and the flavor was spot on. \n\nMango Fried rice: Nothing that we couldn't all make at home. Just add mango and tomatoes. \n\nHomemade hotcakes: These are the things that were so highly reviewed on Check Please. Cute little things and good coconut and corn flavor, but not worth the price.

This is primarily because of the hostess, who must be an owner or at least a relative. I can't imagine why that venue would keep her otherwise. \n\nShe was loud and annoying, literally yelling across the small room constantly at the waiters as she sat like a huge glittering lump on her hostess chair, which unfortunately was close to my table. I assume she was giving them instructions but yelling in a language i don't know doesn't cancel out its intrusiveness. She acted as our waitress part of the time and we had to ask three times for water and twice for tea. Don't get me started on her TMI about the 14 medications she takes. I don't care; I'm on a date and we're paying for dinner. \n\nThe hostess tried the trick that Chinese restaurants in tourist areas often do. As she was taking our order, she said 'you love so-and-so hot plate, you should try' and we said politely 'that sounds nice but no thanks' and she repeated 'everybody like, you try' and we again nodded 'no' politely. Sure enough, so-and-so hot plate was the first dish that arrived and since we had ordered four other dishes, we firmly sent it back. She made certain to mention that she didn't know how she accidentally rung up that hot plate, oh my, but of course she was upselling the meal and relying on our American politeness to 'swallow' the bill. I heard her chat up two tables surrounding us with the same schtick.\n\nService was reasonably paced but not consistent. Two groups seated after us got their food served before us. The tables are packed together, which isn't unusual for SF, but the prices are reasonable so i'm okay with them trying to maximize their space. I will mention that the hostess tried to get groups of two to 'share' a four-top, which was unusual and no one agreed to it.\n\nTowards the end of our meal, as i squeezed past the other tables towards the restroom, i saw the hostess sitting at a table by the cashier. She was shoveling food into her mouth and talking open mouthed and waving her hands as the wait staff scurried quietly around her. Suddenly i remembered the mother from the movie Wild at Heart. Stick a dark wig and Asian features on that character and you've got this hostess.\n\nI suggest that you take out from this location -- the food is truly yummy -- or go to the Marnee Thai at 9th & Irving in Inner Sunset. That venue is almost a Five Star rating because the amazing food has a notable absence of crazy lady flavor. When i arrived at this Marnee Thai last week, i realized that i had been here a few years back and wondered to my boyfriend why i hadn't returned. Well... i remember now.", "author": "debbie r."}

The wait for a table isn't too bad if your group isn't too huge.  Once you get a table, you are elbow to elbow with your neighbors.  \n\nThe service is good.

Thank goodness we were only a party of two and were seated almost right away.\n\nIt's true that this place is wayyyyyy too crowded.  To the point that I am sure it is a fire hazard.  Servers can barely squeeze through.  I would say this restaurant can seat 30 comfortably but somehow it looks and feel as though they have squeezed 50+ people. I had to sit so close to my table that my ribs were pushing up against it.  My husband was not comfortable either since he could not stretch his legs.\n\nOn to the food.  We ordered Angel wings, crab fried rice & Pad Kee Mao.\n\nAngel Wings - pretty good.  About 7 pieces.  Saucy, good texture, good flavor.\n\nCrab fried rice - too salty for me.  Tasted very basic.  Didn't think there was anything special or insanely delicious.\n\nPad Kee Mao - tomato based.  Very different from King of Thai.  Husband thought it tasted like it was cooked with ketchup.  I thought it was fine.  Again not a dish to really rave about.\n\nAnother note: there is only 1 person (who i assume is the owner) taking orders.  Trying to flag someone down to take our order, bag up our left overs, and get the check was a bit of a hassle.\n\nI would give this restaurant another try.

And note to all this is the second time I have been here but the review is based on my most recent visit considering the last time I was here was 5-6 years ago.\n\nLuckily when we came in we were seated immediately. The place settings here include a spoon and fork, so my friend asked for chopsticks. I find it kind of odd that they only had a place setting of only a spoon and fork, usually they had chopsticks as well. Not a big deal since we got the chopsticks. The waitress gave us water with lime inside, very refreshing, however it did take them a while to refill my water.\n\nWe started out with Golden Triangles, which contained pumpkin, potato, and curry in a skin very similar to fried wontons or samosas. It tasted very much like samosas (which is one of my favorite Indian food appetizers). It was on the spicy side but I didn't care because it tasted delicious. I am not a huge fan of spicy foods but I made this an exception and if I come back this will definitely be on my appetizer list.\n\nI ordered Pad Se-Ew, in my opinion it seemed more flavorful here than at other Thai restaurants I have been to. Also I like that they put regular broccoli in it rather than Chinese broccoli. My friend ordered Chan Pad Poo, yes weird name but it was actually pretty good, it contained crab and he ordered it a little spicy ( too spicy for me so I only had a little). \n\nOur eating experience was very good, our palates were definitely satisfied. However like I said before the water wasn't refilled as quickly as I would have liked, by the time the appetizers came I was almost finished with my water and it took them until after I was serving seconds on my entr\u00e9e when they gave me more water. They weren't even busy, so I don't know why they lagged on the water. That is basically why I am not giving this restaurant  5 stars.

I would certainly go again just for the food alone, but the environment was a little crazy. I'm used to waiting in line for food, especially during rush hours, but once I was seated after I made a quick phone reservation, my friend and I waited for who knows how long. The wait didn't bother me too much, but once multiple tables who came after us began getting their food (similar to what we ordered), I began to question if they even got our order at all. Not only was everything quite cramped, but one of the workers was yelling throughout while blocking the only way to the kitchen. There definitely needs to be some tables removed, as they couldn't manage to properly seat and take care of all the customers. Even we were missing utensils while the couple next to us were missing plates. \nOverall, the food is great, but during busy hours, definitely not the place I would recommend (maybe unless you order takeout- but be wary of the wait)", "author": "Diane S."}

It was my first time here and a friend recommended it. The food was awesome. I tried the spicy angel wings for appetizer and the pad kee mao as an entree. Both dishes were fantastic. The spicy angel wings was very saucy. There were a lot of garlic and basil in it. The title says spicy but it was not spicy at all. It also has an option where you can add tofu to it. I recommend doing that. The pad kee mao was very yummy. There were chunks of crab meat in it and it was a bit spicy. I loved how they added garlic to it.

My favorite was duck red curry, I asked for super duper spicy and it was just a little bit spicy but still my favorite.  Angel wings and the hot cakes were something May said its most popular and we must try it.  I liked the flavor of the angel wings, but after a few pieces that sweetness and saltiness was too overpowering also the hotcakes, i don't think i can eat more than one of those little silver dollar sized cakes that is a mixture of corn, coconut, pumpkin and rice cake, so sweet and just too much.  I think its more for the american taste bud that loves the more flavor in things.  i'm chinese, i cook and all asian food should be a light tasty umami experience, not heavy flavors like \"orange chicken\" which is fried, then sauteed in a wok with heavy sauces, that's more american style and it works here in america i guess.", "author": "Kevin L."}

BUT until one day, where I wanted to bring a good friend here for his first time to try it out.  We had to wait in line for a while, sure no problem because it's a good Thai place, the owner of the restaurant who is a Thai woman, took the service to an unacceptable level with my expectations of service as a customer. And might I add that I strongly believe she is a gold digger? (just money hungry to pry from customers who are well off/loaded/rich/upper class, whatever you want to call it. Trust me, I can tell, but not sure if anyone else can, but hey maybe that's business, but very unprofessional and disrespectful), when I come from a middle class background. She basically gives more attention and better service to \"them\".\n\n  This was about literally 3-5 years ago and I will never forget it because it was so insulting to my friend and I. So we waited in line for a while, about 30 mins I believe, we were a group of two and we were next and that's what the owner told us.\n\n  There was a group of four \"farangs\" (white person or foreigners in Thai, not being racist, but just putting my point out here) behind us, but my friend and I were first. A table for four suddenly opens up; so for a first come first serve basis, they seated the farangs behind us first instead of my friend and I. That was a total slap to my face because we were told we were next, but the \"farangs\" behind us got ahead of us. Sure, maybe it was maybe more efficient in terms of it being busy, but don't tell us we are next if you are going to sit a group behind us first when we could have sat at the table of four. Maybe you could have gave the other 2 seats to another group of 2. \n\n  So my good friend who was disrespected from that unexpected move, we ended up just eating at the KFC/Taco Bell on 20th and Irving instead. I not only lost face, but my friend did not get a chance to try out the food from this restaurant.\n\n  From then on, I decided to take my money and dine at the other Marnee Thai on 9th and Irving after.

The first time we went there, it was around 9PM and the waiting for seats part doesn't last long.  It's quite misleading because once you sit down, and order, the food take FOREVER to get to you.  \nThe first time, we got a whole variety of things.  We of course had to get the angel wings from other Yelp recommendations.  They were pretty good, but my family and I reached a consensus that we much prefer the wings from San Tung....There was a bit too much sauce on these Angel wings to be eaten as a mere appetizer.  I also got the corn fritters, which were pretty good but not as crispy as I had hoped for.  \n\nThe second time, my friend and I ordered a mere three dishes for takeout, thinking we would have a set time to wait, pick the food up and go home to eat in comfort.  Well, we ordered, and they told us it would take about 15 minutes.  So we went to wait in my car.  After about a safe 20 minutes, we went back in for the food, and they completely ignored us standing there for a good extra 25 to 30 minutes.  Even when they gave us the food, there was no apology in any way shape or form for making us wait for so much longer than they had told us. It was rather infuriating.  I got the green papaya salad with soft shell crab, and we also got fried rice and pad thai.  Albeit the food was pretty good, the wait and the rude service from the employees were - in my opinion - completely not worth it.", "author": "Jane K."}

I actually made a reservation for both Marnee Thai locations to play it safe.\n\nParking was beyond impossible at the 9th Avenue restaurant so we headed over to this one. There was a crowd outside but we went to find the hostess since we had a reservation. The hostess thought I said Stephanie instead of Tiffany when making the reservation. She thought we stopped by 10-15 minutes earlier and \"went for a walk\" so we were next to get seated HA. She told us it was going to be a 10 minute wait which turned into almost half an hour. The restaurant is pretty small so I'm actually surprised that we didn't have to wait longer!\n\nAnyway, my friend and I basically figured out what we were gonna order while waiting so we can hurry up the process. We were starving! We ordered the chicken satay, chicken red curry, chicken pad see ew and thai style fried rice w/ prawns & pineapple. We hadn't made a decision on what meat we wanted w/ our fried rice and the hostess said \"You ordered too much chicken! Too much koko! Have some shrimp!\" so that's why we got the prawns haha.\n\nEverything was delicious! Of course, we ordered wayyyyy too much food but we were able to enjoy a little bit of everything and it was good! The pad see ew was a little spicier than I would've liked, but still good nonetheless.\n\nThe only downside was when I ordered my drink. They give you sodas by the can w/ a cup of nice.

We ordered the Spicy Angel Chicken as an appetizer (best dish we had, good chili-sauce, not super sweet like the sweet chili sauce on most fried chicken wings out there), Pad Thai (noodles were chewy and the sauce and salt was just right), Red Curry with chicken (it didn't taste like curry because the viscosity was lighter than most, and it didn't have the herbal/curry aroma--it seemed watered down by coco juice instead of coconut milk...i'm not sure but that's my inference), and a beef dish which my friends said was gamy, having a more lamby texture (they couldn't finish it).

All were really good to awesome!  The two that stood out to me were the hot cakes because they totally rocked and the pad thai because it was surprisingly not to my liking being very sweet and one dimentional.  Otherwise it was a great visit.  Even the baby liked it there!  He ate some of the potatoes in the yellow curry (his first ethnic food by the way) and we was totally infatuated with the boss lady.

It's not an issue of authenticity or ethnicity.  For sure, the people who staff Marnee are Thai; either that or my Thai dining companion was speaking Pig Latin to them and not his native tongue.  \n\nThe main reason Thai food isn't usually great is because it's hard to do right.  As I've noted in other reviews, people expect French food to be hard and expensive.  But Thai, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, etc. etc., well those gotta be available at some random corner joint, executed to your grandmother's tastes, perfectly, and for el cheap-o to boot.  Because they're, uh, \"ethnic\" and somehow simpler and not up to the standards of Fine Western Dining.\n\nAs usual, the laws of physics apply.\n\nIf you get a green curry with random bits of mystery chicken meat in it, guess what?  It's not exactly up to the standards of an indigenous, regional, insanely-fresh cuisine.  It's tasty enough.

Marnee's isn't that.  At least it's spicy and rich.  But the chicken is unlovely bits of odd white meat.  Is there some law that asian restaurants can't roast chicken whole, every day, break it down, and serve it to order?  Oh wait, only Zuni Cafe is expected to make great chicken.  See above about our collective expectations.\n\nBeef with string beans:  meh.  Sweet-ish, gritty sauce, and more mystery meat of a cut undetermined and unknown to all.\n\nMixed seafood with \"fresh\" green peppercorns.  This one I quite liked, the sauce was a dousing of oily red spiciness, but each bit of seafood was tender and not overcooked and, best of all, identifiable.  It certainly seemed like the fish was fresh.  Given our extreme proximity to great seafood, that's not much to ask.\n\nAvocado salad with green papaya, shrimp.  Room temperature shrimp (jury is out on that one), a mush of sloppily prepped vegetables, nice seasoning.  No real texture.\n\nMarnee was touted by my Thai friend as the best in the area, but I suspect that is damning it with faint praise.  The food is certainly edible.  It's not fine cooking though and, frankly, we won't great Thai food in the area until we change our outlooks a bit.  Most of us don't know what great Thai food is but I suspect that, like obscenity, \"we'll know it when we see it.\"", "author": "J W."}

We arrived at 7 with a few couples and people waiting outside. I thought the wait would be at least 45 minutes, however the lady seated us pretty quick after seating all the people before us.\n\nThis place won sooo many awards for their food. I haven't tried many of their dishes, however their food is great! I LOVE THEIR ANGEL WINGS! \n\nI agree with all the reviews on the busy and crowded atmosphere. However, I felt the service wasn't that bad. They help you serve your rice when they bring you the rice pot, and they're constantly refilling our water. The lady checked up on each table and asked about the food and how we're doing.\n\nDespite the long wait, I definitely recommend to try Marnee Thai.

Next came a generous salad, quite nice even if the dressing was a touch overpowering.  No biggie...we ate it all.  Our entree was fresh seabass with curry and Thai basil over brown rice. Good and recommended. Now what can you say about brown rice? I know it's a commodity...but Marnee's might be the best brown rice I've ever sampled. \n\nThe venue is baseline...defintely a destination to fill a food craving rather than the full dining ambience. Marnee Thai is on board for a repeat visit. I won't be fighting through the crowd or stalking a parking spot or standing in a queue to gain admittance.

Either that, or I just had a low tolerance for spicy.\n\nBut anyhow though, fast forward it a bit. Now I've never really enjoyed Thai cuisine all that much and its partially because of that time I got food poisoning from it..(review on Yukol) So from that point on, Ive never really trusted eating Thai food..i know its a horrible and wrong reason to shun out a cuisine but I just couldn't help it.\n\nMy lady though loves Thai food, she even has a friend who owns a Thai Restaurant. So after dodging the idea of eating Thai food for so long, I finally loosened up and start trying Thai again.\n\nAnyways, so we finally decided to come here and now I wish I had started eating Thai sooner. We ordered the Angel Wings which were not spicy and was very tasty. A lot of garlic but still good. We also had the basa filet, now this comes in your choice of 3 styles of sauces. I dont remember what sauce we had but when I post up the pictures you will know. That was incredibly good, I could just eat that with rice and call it a day...and last but not least we had the duck pineapple fried rice. Marnee Thai did not skimp out on the duck and the pineapples had flavor to it. Usually most places that have pineapple fried rice, their pineapple always ends up with little or no flavor..just a bland fruit.\n\nOverall we were very pleased with this place, especially me and I guess thanks to Marnee Thai I can really stop being so weary about getting food poisoning from a Thai restaurant.", "author": "phillip w."}

After being told we'd have a 45-60 min wait at both Nopa and Nopalita, my friend and I were too hungry to wait and decided to come here. We were seated immediately and quickly put our order in. I went to wash my hands and minutes later our order if crispy sweet and hot Angel Wings arrived. I remember this as the standout dish from my last visit, and it did not disappoint. Crumbled, crunchy (fried?) basil leaves sit atop a 6 pack of saucey wings. \n\nOur entrees followed just as soon as we finished the wings. We shared a special which was a red curry pork dish with perfectly steamed broccoli. The curry was not spicy at all, but very thick and chock full 'o flavor. The pork was tender enough to cut with your fork and again fresh basil made its presence felt. Very nice serving for $10. Our noodle dish was the classic Pad See Ew. I've had better and worse. It was good, no complaints, but I almost wish we had gone for something a tad more 'out there' as the menu has a good deal of items I've never seen or heard of before. \n\nAll in all, Marnee is a very solid Thai choice. The atmosphere is a tad cramped (we sat next to two college aged valley type bimbos that were all \"like OMG\" using their 'outdoor' voices) but the food is spot on, and the service is polite and attentive.", "author": "John L."}

In my opinion, this one, like most originals, is the better of the two.  Plus, if you are easily entertained, this is the location where you will find the overweight owner brusquely shouting in Thai to her staff.  She is an uproarious hoot, but not everyone thinks so, as you can tell from a skimming of the reviews.\n\nThe restaurant is a modest, cozy size, a no-pressure type of place where friends and family can get together and eat family style with ease.\n\nThe food here is delicious.  All of the curries are great, especially the green curry (with beef, chicken, pork, or prawns), yellow curry with chicken (you can get it with lamb or prawns, too), red curry with roasted duck, and Mussamun chicken curry.  They also provide the option of having the curries vegetarian using vegetable soy protein.  The pad thai, green papaya salad, and Thai fried rice are also very tasty.  They are known for their angel wings, which are spicy, garlicky tender specimens deep-fried to a crisp.  The basa filet is a chef specialty and pretty much a homerun.  For dessert, definitely get the wonderful roti.  The coconut ice cream and Thai iced teas are also delightful delectables.\n\nService can get slow, but Marnee Thai is usually a full house.

We both looked over and saw that there were MICE behind the rafters!  You could see their noses and their feet peeking out from behind the rafters and you could see them moving the rafters as they frantically ran along the walls and ceiling.  Then they started shrieking and squeaking loudly, at which point Marnee strategically turned up the music in hopes of drowning out the noise.  We were HORRIFIED.  What's worse is that throughout this ordeal, they did not close the restaurant!  They simply put \"reserved\" signs closest to the action and allowed people to come in and be seated a little further away so as not to interrupt business for the night.  We, for obvious reasons, lost our appetites and asked them to pack up the rest of our meal (which was unfortunately most of it, since this all happened pretty soon after we were seated).  We were not comped in any way, nor did the staff apologize or in any way acknowledge what had happened.  \n\nWe threw out our leftovers the next day and the bf did a google search to see if there was any record of what had happened.  Apparently, if you go to the SF Department of Health website, you can see the health inspection scores of any restaurant in the city and what they have been cited for.  I'm going to warn you in advance that you will not like what you see for most places.  It's time San Francisco makes restaurants display their grades in their windows like LA so things like this don't happen as easily and so that restaurants actually have to close while dealing with their vermin problems.  People get sick from this!\n\nIt's safe to say that I'm NEVER going back to this location of Marnee Thai.  \n\nP.S.

After hearing about Marnee Thai earlier in the week on \"Check Please,\" the 4 of us abandoned all East Bay plans, and ventured wayyyy out into the Sunset  to check it out.\n\nThough traffic made us late, we still got there *just* in the nick of time (6:45pm on Friday). Right after we were seated a line seemed to magically appear in front of this tiny Irving St. restaurant. \n\nPros:  The OMFG-Amazing Food\n\nBetween the 4 of us we had 8 different dishes, and not a SINGLE ONE was bad! The Angel Wings are no joke, and the Chilean Sea Bass with Garlic Pepper sauce was a force to be reckoned with! I ordered a yellow curry that was made with shrimp & scallops, and for once it did not have potatoes in it!! The Avocado Salad was also really really nice cool and refreshing with a solid spicy kick from behind. The 4 of us split a fried banana with coconut ice cream, and it was heavenly. If summer had a taste this, my friends, would be it.\n\nCons:   The Atmosphere/Service\n\nOk, so, we were a tad late for our reservation but we had still called in advance to warn them. Of all the empty tables in the house, the waitress had us sit at the 4-top RIGHT next to the bustling kitchen door. She also denied all of our requests to push 2 2-top tables together so that we could have a better ambiance. Best part? When the restaurant got busier they definitely pushed tables together for other people. \n\nSitting next to the cashier & kitchen area was extremely loud, and towards the end of our meal another waitress actually pushed a 2-top (with 2 people seated & eating) so close to us that we might as well all been at the same table! Now, we're a pretty flexible group, but the couple who got shoved underneath our elbows were not happy with the experience.\n\nAlso, we were all pleased that our food came out so quickly, but we couldn't help but feel like we were being rushed by the wait staff because the restaurant was so busy. I was shocked that they served us our check along with the dessert without asking if there was anything else that we wanted. \n\nOverall: \n\nI give this one 3 stars, yes the food was absolutely beyond amazing but the overall atmosphere was a bit overwhelming.

I received my food at 8:45, three times past the expected timeframe.\n\nI explained myself and had expected a solid restaurant would do something to appease an already paid customer but they in fact kept saying \"Sorry\".\n\nAll I received were excuses, with no reasons and no care from the line manager.  Don't get me wrong, they serve tasty food.  Their service though through this experience and others merit them a one-star rating.", "author": "Venkat P."}

After hearing Marnee Thai got this award, got that award, got 4 stars on Yelp, etc., I was hoping for a really good meal. Damn you expectations!\n\nWe waited for about 15 minutes for a party of 4 and upon being seated, we stared at the menu to decide what we want. Usually, we're pretty quick about things but this time around, it took us a bit longer to decide. Why? I'm not sure, nothing really stood out to us but we finally settled for...\n\nIMPERIAL ROLLS\nPlease go to PPQ up a few blocks for it! These were just okay, but definitely hit the spot if you're craving some sort of fried goodness. \n\nKANG DANG (Red Curry) w/ Beef\nDANGGGGGGGGG this dish was SPICY!! It states that it was a medium spice and normally I can stand curry spices but O M GEE, after a few bites with rice, I couldn't eat this dish anymore. Cooked well, but I think I should have stuck w/ the yellow curry (mild).\n\nBBQ PORK\nI'm sorry, this was really really dry. It just tasted like an over cooked pork chop cut into 7 or 8 pieces. Nothing to it, so I don't suggest ordering it.\n\nPAD KEE MAO (Noodle Dish) w/ chicken\nThis dish stated that it was spicy but when it came out, it tasted like ketchup noodles. YAY for me since I like ketchup but it was a let down since I was expecting a not so sweet and tangy noodle dish.\n\nPAD PRIG KHING w/chicken\nGreen beans and chicken. This dish was really good but on the oily side since it is cooked with a spicy chili paste. If you can look past it, I would definitely recommend to order this and eat it with rice! \n\nMANGO STICKY RICE\nI think Mandalay makes a better mango sticky rice but I think it's all about preference here. The sticky rice here at Marnee Thai is more separated, and not as gooey and stuck together as the one at Mandalay. The mangoes were soft and sweet, so that's a plus. White coconut sauce was poured on top of the sticky rice so this gave it an extra kick to it. I despise coconut but this was actually okay in my book.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say Marnee Thai is the best Thai Restaurant I've been to but it definitely doesn't suck. I would revisit Marnee Thai for some green beans and mango sticky rice!", "author": "Heidi C."}

But since moving to San Francisco, I have now eaten at Marnee Thai twice (yes, TWICE) and it's been a good decision each time... even if it wasn't really my decision.\n\nThe first visit was an all vegetarian affair with a bit of shrimp thrown into the mix. High quality papaya salad and tofu based curries. It was a decidedly spicy set of dishes.\n\nOn the return visit, we were on a quest for duck, and got it in the form red curry with roasted duck. But before we talk about duck, we started the evening with deep fried bacon wrapped shrimp. I don't generally associate bacon with Thai food, so let me say, they know how to make bacon. We mixed it up with green mango salad which wasn't nearly as spicy as the papaya salad... in fact, none of the dishes were very spicy this go 'round. \n\nThe duck was, without a doubt, amazing. Sadly, the curry was filled with large tomato wedges and bell peppers, which really aren't my scene. The accompanying pineapple, on the other hand, really added a nice sweetness to the mix.\n\nNext I want to try the takeout, which seems like a popular option for folks in the neighborhood.

On the plane ride here, my bf marked all the restaurants near my apt that sounded worth visiting. Marnee Thai on Irving was one of these. Last night, famished, we made our way to Marnee to try it out. Upon walking in, the amazing smell of Thai food enveloped us, and the place was packed, so much so that the only table left is the one next to the kitchen entrance, and we took it. The waitstaff is super friendly, all wearing authentic Siam clothing (I guess?) which says a lot considering the women's skirts are ankle length.\n\nDecor- da bomb. The walls are covered in bamboo-esque wood, large embroidered hangings throughout the room, and fresh orchids on each table. The orchids alone made me love the place. On the back wall the daily specials are posted, but also provided on a menu on each table. We ordered the imperial rolls to start, and then I got the green curry (medium spice) with tofu and steamed rice for entree and my bf the pad kee mao with duck. Rolls were good, came with a spicy sauce to dip them in. \n\nOur entrees- I ate almost all of the pad kee mao. My curry wasn't really spicy OR sweet enough, considering the coconut milk, and the eggplant was a little too mushy for my taste. I've never ordered green curry before, so this is no fault of the restaurant and I'll stick to red/yellow in the future! The pad kee mao- so effing good. Perhaps this is because we got it with duck (da bomb) but the spiciness was just right for me. It came with sliced fresh tomatoes as well, a perfect contrast to the drunk noodles and duck. \n\nI was all ready to rate this as my go-to Thai restaurant in Sunset, however then the bill came. We were charged $1.50 for each scoop of steamed rice for my curry- a first in my 10+ years of eating Thai food. It escapes me as to how you are supposed to eat curry if not with rice to soak it up with? I was just shocked that rice wasn't included in the dish, and even more so that each tiny scoop was $1.50.

I've been to the one on 9th and Irving and the quality of food is defintely uncomparable. We ordered the angel wings and it came out in less then 5 minutes...we were super excited but as we bite into the meat, realized its been cooked a while ago and was just heated because the meat was tough to chew and stale. Pad-thai was to sweet..as if there was to much brown sugar. Papaya salad was ok. Weirdest thing is its a Thai restuarant and they don't serve noodle soup for dinner. I was craving for noodle soup and told the waitress and she said they'll add $3 to the dish if I order it for dinner since its a lunch dish (and there was only 1 noodle soup dish she said they had which was the duct noodle soup), making this noodle soup 11 bucks and its not even worth it. There was no flavor, the broth was very plain and oily. I should have just gone across the street to Loi's Vietnamese Restuarant and get thier amazing pho for $6. Our waitress had to be flagged to refill our water eventhough it was a weekday at 4pm and there were 2 waitresses just walking or standing around.

As you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by the sight and smells of the open kitchen beside you. Familiar and unfamiliar spices alike surround the team of chefs as they prepare gorgeous looking food. I knew I was in for a treat right away.\n\n The seating was packed pretty tightly, but it gave the already promising restaurant a very homey vibe. Plus, you were seated close enough to check out what other people were eating, which pleased my lingering curiosity. It did not help me decide what to order though, for the menu was pretty overwhelming. The seemingly endless choices do make decisions tough at first, but at least there is a lot of new things to come back to. Oh, and I will be back! The menu is full of authentic Thai dishes, which is refreshing to see in the wake of Americanized \"ethnic\" food. \n\n We ended up ordering the Spicy angel wings, Tom Yum (with chicken), Kang Dang (with pork). The angel wings were exactly that, heavenly. The Tom Yum was also great, featuring some very explosive flavors along with a good spicy kick. The highlight though, was the Kang Dang. It was absolutely fantastic. It's one of those dishes that you have to describe how good it is and how much you are enjoying it to everyone around you with each and every bite. You must order this if you go, trust me. \n\n This place was amazing, and it was easily the best Thai I've ever had. Reasonably priced, perfect portions, and great service.", "author": "Russell S."}

The food was definitely a notch over the regular King of Thai dishes I usually eat. And the decor is by far one of the nicest I've seen in a restaurant. They actually make the interior of the restaurant look as if it were inside a bamboo thatched hut. Very very nice. Just look at the pictures!\n \nThe only minus, beside the crowded seating, is the people who were sitting right next to us. It seems that the crowd of people who come here are either:\n1. regulars\n2. people who semi-live here (aka sf state students) who must bring their friends to introduce them to the splendors of thai food\n3. Passer-bys who think it's a nice place to eat\n4. Annoying trendy foodies/hipsters/asian-fetish/etc, who come into the restaurant and raise the decibel meter substantially. \n\nMe and my group were #3, while the people seated behind us were #4. Thankfully they left after 20 minutes, and we ate in silence.

Perhaps the place offers more if you order meat, which would be paradoxical because it costs them more yet they charge the same for the tofu. There were also only a total of three blocks of tofu in the eggplant dish (number 55), so this seems to be standard here. However there were bits of beef and pork in it!

When I first walked in, it was like walking into a hut! The decorations really nice, the tables are really clean, but the bathroom is a bit cramped and dirty. Other than that, it was a nice place. The restaurant doesn't have many seats, so expect a wait during busy times.\n\nI shared a Pad Thai and Green Curry.  How was the Pad Thai? Good. I would rate it above average.  The Green Curry? Also good. It wasn't that spicy to the point where you don't taste anything. It was right, and I was able to taste the flavor. The service was nice, but maybe it was because we were the only ones in the restaurant.\n\nThe food here for lunch isn't that expensive, and I would definitely come here again.

We waited about 30 to 40 minutes to get a table... but when we did... it was 2- 2 tops separated by and inch. We were literally eating with another couple on our first date.

It's quite tasty.  We got six different dishes for our party of six, including Pad Ma Kuer, Pad Prig Pao, Gai Samoon Prai, and Chad Pad Poo, etc.  Basically sums up to a curry taste, a peanut sauce taste, and noodles and rice.  All were really good and you can really taste all the spices and different flavors.  They use full twigs of peppercorn in some dishes which I thought was different.  \n\nService and health issues is a totally different story.  First off, it took us at least 3 or 4 times just to ask for water.  There were about 4 servers in there and the restaurant is tiny.  We were crammed right in the middle of the restaurant, my back literally up against someone else's back behind me.   When we asked for more rice, something weird happened.  First, they refilled our pot - but with just one scoop of rice for 6 people!  So of course, a minute later, we had to ask for another refill.  Instead of refilling our pot, they took a pot from another table they just served and dumped it on our table.  I was a little confused because I had never seen a restaurant give you a different rice bowl back from somewhere else.  What if someone had eaten out of it already, just a thought right?  I also noticed they took our old pot and switched it to somewhere else.  \n\nAnother thing I've noticed while just walking by is that they would take their garbage cans out, those dirty, disgusting, thai food smelling cans of garbage out through the FRONT of the restaurant, while people are still sitting at the tables eating.  I find that to be very disturbing.  Imagine sitting there eating, and they're wheeling all the garbage passed your table.  Sick.  \n\nAnyway, I guess I'd go back for the food if I had to, but maybe a better option is to get it to go.  Maybe then I won't have to see where or how they're cooking it.

They were that lazy that they couldnt make one beef and one chicken? We told her multiple times that we wanted one beef and one chicken until my friend and I decided just to get the same meat so she would go away.

When we ordered we made sure that we had one non spicy order and one spicy order since some of us didnt want any spicy food.  When the angel wings came they looked identical and we asked Marnee which one was spicy and which one wasnt spicy and she couldnt tell. -__-  She told us one thing and then looked again and changed her mind.  Us non-spicy people decided not to risk it at all. (Strike Two!!)\n\nStrike Three had to be that the pad see lew was not good at all...

Sorry, my mistake for being responsible to spread the news.  Any who, it was quite alright as I do like to see a business that I liked succeed.    But I would never expect to be so discriminated by a restaurateur.  Yeah, you read right, discriminated.  I'm not going to pretend that it never happened because Ms. Piggy got me angry enough to never go back and don't mind sharing my experience with everyone I know--10 YEARS LATER.\n\nWhat happened:  I have my share of 45mins - 1 hour wait time like many other paying customers just to have their overly salted and intense spicy dishes.  What can I say?  I have spicy food weakness that needs to be satisfied after discovery of Thai food.  I was very happy to eat their food since at that time it was they only thing I know as spicy goodness.  Little did I became to realized that Mz Silly Blanket Pig would soon practice service tactics based on two groups of customers.\n \nGroup A - parties who belongs to this group will be ignore and check will be handed to you prematurely.  How's the dessert?  If you get rushed out before you finish your meal, how can you get to dessert?  \n\nGroup B - parties who belongs to this group will get Ms. Prosciutto's full attention when she is there, get asked if they want dessert, can fully digest their food, check presented after dessert, butt kissed, and the full personal escort, waddle-style, to the door with a fake smile.  Ahhhhh, aren't you glad to be the elite?\n\nWell, because of their decent food, I've tolerated it for a good five to six times just to make sure I'm not overly sensitive and blindsided that it's maybe just that they are so busy due to rapid success.  The last two times I have observed that race has a huge factor to her service treatment.  What broke the camel's back was when I brought my best friend (happened to be the same ethnicity) there to celebrate for something (this was about 10 years ago, can't remember what was it that we were celebrating) and upon what I didn't know was our last dish, the bill came in my face.  WTF?  Guess which group we were in? Not to mentioned Ms. Bacon's staff to give me my check before we were even half done?  Ugh!  \n\nI was young hothead and in front of my beloved BFF, will not let this slide.  I motioned the Ms. Pig Shank over and gave her my most sophisticated glance and left side grin (and you know I'm pissed if I give you the left corner mouth grin!) while suppressing my urge to whack her with my right back hand (my stronger arm) and asking her, \"Why did we get the bill before we were asked if we wanted dessert?\"  \n\nNo answer, just a stupid grin and a \"deer in the headlights\" stare back.  Perhaps, it was the first time she had seen a different kind of Group A customer, so she did not know what to say to that.  Keep in mind, I've been tolerant and yet previously rather not do or say anything, but that was one of the few times I had to curb my curiosity.  But ah, yet, it was unanswered.  \n\nSo from that day on boys, girls, and you in-betweens, I had seek out other Thai restaurants.  I want to spend my hard earned money where I don't Feel disrespected and maltreated.  With that said, I do hope they change their way of business in terms of service in these two groups and I invite you to pay attention to how different groups are treated there.  Although it's been 10+ years and I hope they've improved.  I would like some updates since there is no way I will spend my time or a dime there again.  Needless to say, I will not support their new location either...you feel me?", "author": "Vanna S."}

Well, the last time I went, service was absolutely horrible (we didn't get the waiter and waitress we had in the past). First, we had to flag down the waitress to order. When we ordered, she had a \"I-could-care-less\" type of attitude.  Then, when our orders arrived, she put down all three bowls of soup at the side of the table. She didn't care to find out whose order was whose, and set it down at that person's place. Nope, she just set it down abruptly and walked away. We were left  experimenting each dish, just to find out whose soup was whose. It was ridiculous, especially considering that the bowls of soup were extremely hot to the touch and hard to move.\n\nThat was bad - but what was unacceptable was when the bill arrived. She had overcharged us for one dish. My dad went to tell her that she had overcharged us. She then gave us the cash difference - but my dad reminded her that they owed us not just the cash difference between the price of the dishes, but also the tax difference. She played dumb for a minute, and then said it was not their policy to refund tax. Then, she said very loudly - so that all patrons could hear -- \"What? You want two cents back? Fine! I'll give you two cents back!\" My dad replied, \"It's not the two cents - it's the fact that not only did you overcharge us, but you didn't properly refund us either for a mistake on your part.\"\n\nAfter all this - not one word of apology or an attempt to make up for this awfully poor experience (no apology dessert, of course). Instead, she tried to embarrass my dad for asking her to refund us completely for her mistake. We are not going back, no matter how good the food is.", "author": "Carolyn M."}

Turned down the apartment, but came back to verify the claim for myself partially because I love Thai food so much, but also because the neighbourhood is more what I wish the Outer Richmond were like and wanted to check it out a bit.\n\nThe place was busy for dinner on a weekend night--a good sign indeed--though even for a table of four the wait wasn't unbearable. Strangely, a slightly older woman simply asked \"how many?\" when we arrived, and that was it. No waiting list, no name-taking, nothing. Amazingly, she just walked away, yet she came back a bit later and showed us our table with no fuss.\n\nI'm a simple diner; often eschewing beverages in favour of simple ice water, and passing on appetisers so I can focus my appetite on the main course. I'm also perfectly content with simple dishes, so an order of Chicken-Mango Fried Rice from the evening's specials menu was absolutely perfect: the fruit was sweet and fresh, the chicken not overcooked or fatty, and the rice/veggies were the perfect consistency; not wet or greasy.\n\nThai food is almost never cheap; I seem to spend nearly ten bucks no matter where I go or what is ordered. Marnee seemed right in line with that, so no surprises. The ambiance is cozy for a dinner and not too noisy; maybe not quite romantic, but calming if you did want to make it a dinner date. Its design has a few \"exotic\" touches here and there, but seems mostly Western-influenced; definitely very little of the exquisite woodworking that is found at other places around town.\n\nBottom line: very good food, reasonable prices, friendly service.

In a way, it's a way for me to gauge the taste of a restaurant. I can safely say that I've never had Pad Kee Mao served like this before. The dish that I know is usually semi-spicy flat noodles served with basil and what I think is Chinese broccoli, various peppers and chili, with your choice of beef, chicken, or pork. At Marnee, however, the noodles are prepared with a tangier sort of sauce, which was both different and delicious. And of course I had to have it with duck when I found out that was an option. \n\nI'm definitely willing to come here more often now and check out the other dishes. I wouldn't say that Marnee is my new favorite spot, but it has my attention. The prices are slightly higher than their competitors--something I hear people mention quite often--but I really don't think it's that drastic.", "author": "Edmund C."}

There's no right or wrong, just what you think?\n\nAnyway, I always get the corn fritters, one duck dish, one curry, and one vegetable dish.  I believe I've liked or loved everything I've tried.

She also thinks she is being helpful, because in her culture giving advice is not a bad thing, it's a maternal sign of caring and giving - like it or not you are eating at an authentic Thai Restaurant when you come here.  Plus, the language she speaks (Taiwanese) is generally pronounced louder than English, kinda like Chinese and has harsher tones - so she is not 'yelling' at her employees, but merely giving them your order - plus, what's the joy of owning such a small place if you can't do as you please.\n\nIt's all part of the experience of Marnee Thai - they want everyone to feel like they are at a family style dinner party in their living room.  My review could be biased because I like the owners so much.\n\nIn comparison to the other Thai food I've had, Marnee still and always will rank supreme.  I think this is because they assure quality in their products and they make everything from scratch - you won't find any frozen food in their fridge.\n\nI recommend appetizers number one and number five, the bacon wrapped prawns and their version of the egg roll - the sauce is so bomb, gotta have some addictive ingredient in it.  The Pad Thai and spicy chick with green beans are also wonderful and the Pad See Eiw -or however it's really spelled is amazing, especially if you add in a little dried chili.\n\nShit . . .try anything, I'm sure it's all great, I'm just so addicted to my favorites I'm having trouble branching out.\n\nA must eat for all true San Franciscans", "author": "Lauren G."}

I actually came here last Sunday too, so that's twice in 2 weeks!\n\nThe experience last Sunday was great, we had the Summer Rolls, Mango Fried Rice with Shrimp, the Sea Bass with Garlic and Pepper, and the Guay Tiew Koor noodles.  Based on last Sunday's dinner, I would have reaffirmed my 4-5 star rating.  The summer rolls were decent, and went well with the tamarind sauce.  The mango fried rice was amazing and very flavorful as were the noodles.  I felt that the sea bass was a little overpowered by the garlic and pepper that completely covered the top half of it, but it was still good if we scrapped it off.  Also, the portions for the fried rice and the noodles were decently sized, so it looks like their rice and noodle portions are larger than their a la carte entrees.\n\nHowever, last night's experience was very disappointing.  I ordered the Mango Fried rice again (with chicken this time)  because I had like it so much last Sunday.  We waited about 10-15 minutes after the appetizer before our food came out. They brought out the wrong dish, and brought me Chicken Fried Rice.  When I asked them about it, they took it back, and brought it back out about 2 minutes later, but with a few diced mango pieces and cashews in it.  Obviously, they had just tossed in the mangos and cashews and just stirred fried the rice a little more.  I wouldn't mind this if it tasted like the mango fried rice I had before, but it definitely didn't!  It was saltier, yet less flavorful, and the rice was harder and drier because they had to cook it longer after they added the ingredients.  It tasted like their chicken fried rice with some pieces of mangos rather than the mango fried rice that I've ordered before.  This is totally unacceptable and the only reason I'm not giving it a 1 star is because I've liked the food in the past.", "author": "Tyler C."}

I mean, not only was this dish great, but it could easily hold up a spicier punch.  I would easily drive across SF for this dish alone.  \n\nThe service was alright, certainly nothing special.

This place has a very Thai cultured atmosphere with a lot of decorations. It's very cute. It's kind of small and cramped though. I had one of the noodles, forgot what its called but it's similiar to pad thai, and it was delicious! I ate the whole thing and the price is around $7-8, which isn't bad.", "author": "Vicki L."}

I like the food, spicy chicken with brown rice, tom yum soup, pad see ew.  But the service is what really bothers me.  \n\nI ordered to go so I wouldn't have to deal with the customer service (lack thereof really) and even with a take out service it was BAD.  I ordered a EXTRA spicy chicken with brown rice, I of course get WHITE rice.  I told the waitress about the issue, she mumbled under her breath and changed the rice.  I also see on the food slip that it said Medium spicy, when in fact I wanted it EXTRA spicy.  Argh.. so whatever I go to pay with my debit card.  She slides the card and says, your card is not going thru, do you have another card.  NO WAY.  I have money in my account.. so I ask her to do it again.  Another grumble under her breath.  She even rolls her eyes.  Again she attempts to process the transaction and she says \"No, its not going thru.\"  So I give her another card and again, it doesn't go thru.  Obviously its a problem with her machine not my freakin card.  So another waitress says to me quietly, do you have cash, our machine isn't working.  NO DUH.  Don't say that my card isn't going thru when its obviously a problem with your machine, AND roll your eyes at me.  So I search my wallet for cash, and give up all my quarters to pay for my order which was made incorrectly.  \n\nTo wrap this all up, if you can ignore the snide gestures, bad customer service, and slip ups with ordering, this is the place to go for food.", "author": "Alice E."}

I heard about it but since it was on Irving and all ready use to going to other establishments when on said street, this place never really becomes an option. The place wasn't crowded but then again, it wasn't during lunch rush hours or anything. The food was great and the service was cool. I liked this place better than the other Thai place in Daly City that I might have reviewed... or not... eh, it's Friday and my brain is lacking oxygen from working. I can't remember everything.\n\nI would give this place five stars but there's some things that get to me. One, there was this huge fly inside. I usually don't have problems with flies in restaurant unless they're all over our table, which it really wasn't, but it was freaking huge. Two, the place is on the small side for me. For some reason, they put us near this obnoxious group and since I was the third wheel, I got the side that other people were on and so I had to watch not bumping into the asshole behind me. There were other tables... I don't understand why they had to put us near them.\n\nOther than that, I'm sure if I went here again and there was less annoying people and they gave us a better seat where I didn't feel cramped because of the person behind me, this place could be a five-star place. The Bangkok fried rice (or was it the Thai Fried Rice... I don't remember) was excellent, by the way.", "author": "Chris S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-28", "description": "WOW!!! Looking for Thai Cuisine? Look no further. I've tried quite a few Thai restaurants from San Diego to Los Angeles, and even a few up in the Bay Area, but Marnee Thai has got to be THE BEST restaurant I've been to HANDS DOWN.  I know this sounds a bit cliche, but the food is absolutely fabulous.  Here's my rule of thumb:  When trying out a new Thai restaurant, you've gotta try 3 things.  Their Papaya Salad, their Pad Thai, and one of their curry dishes.  I believe these are \"power dishes\"- the dishes that make or break the restaurant.  We started out with the Spicy Angel Wings and the Papaya Salad.  Now, if you haven't been reading anyone else's reviews, about 90% of them tell you to try the Angel Wings... there's a reason for that... trust us on this one.  The Papaya Salad is extremely light and refreshing.  It's a great way to warm up your palate for what's to come.  We then had the Kang Keaw with chicken.  This is a green curry eggplant dish.  Here's what I loved about this dish: 1) the curry is not overpowered by tons of coconut juice, and 2) the chicken (or your choice of meat) and vegetables aren't drowned in a pool of broth.  We had this with some steamed rice, and I swear... I could have eaten JUST the curry broth and rice all day long.  Of course we ordered the Pad Thai.  This is the dish that won me over.  The noodles are perfectly cooked to the right texture.  The sauce is not greasy, and the flavor has a \"home-made\" feel to it.  Definitely not like any other Thai restaurant I've been to.\n\nThe downside to this restaurant... it's small and it gets crowded.  We went on a Sunday and luckily we made reservations.  By the time we were done eating, the waiting crowd outside had amassed to about 15-20 people.  I had to squeeze my way out of the restaurant.  We were seated right next to the kitchen entrance in front of the register.  This is not a good place to sit.  In order to get to the bathroom, you gotta go through the kitchen.  So, not only were the waiters, waitresses, and bus boys trying to get in and out of the kitchen; but now we had people trying to line up to get into the bathroom!  This was semi-tolerable.  What I didn't like was the younger waiter running back and forth trying to clean and set the tables.  I understand it's busy and you're trying to accomodate your guests, but it seemed a bit unprofessional.  He was literally RUNNING inside the restaurant.  And beware: if you haven't touched one of your plates in two minutes, they may take it away.  I was resting up to go for round 2 on my curry when one of the waiters reached in to take the plate from me.  I told him I wasn't done, and he apologized.  So for the down side of the restaurant, I had to retract a star from my rating.  But overall... I highly recommend!!!", "author": "Richie C."}

It was good & veggis and prawns were fresh, but the dish wasn't exceptional.  We had the golden triangles for an appitizer and those were a hit at our table.\n\nHere are the problems we encountered . . . mid-way through dinner our hostess/server/owner came by and explained in a cheerful tone something along the lines of . . .  \" we have extra Angel Wings . . . it is a busy night . . . they are a favorite dish . . . would you like to try?\"  \"Uh, sure, okay!\" my meat eating boyfriend replied.  We looked at each other thinking - wow, we're coming back!  A few minutes later a plate of wings arrived at our table.  At the end of the evening the check came . . .\n\nYou guessed it, we were billed for the Angle Wings.  Honestly, neither of us was surprised.  We're not naive.  Perhaps we should have inquired about whether they were going to be on the house.  Regardless, I don't feel this is the customer's burden.  We were offered something because they had \"extra\" of a favorite dish, and we said yes.  Oh well.  \n\nHere's the kicker - checked my bank account today and discovered they charged us twice!  One charge for $46.50 and another for $46.  I called about an hour ago and am waiting for the owner to call me back.

You can throw a stone and hit a thai place. \n\nAnyway, Marnee, is almost perfection. I went there for the first time last Friday. I hadn't planned on going there. I was actually driving aimlessly around the city trying to find a decent place to eat around 9PM that night. Everywhere I went I didn't want to get out. Finally I somehow ended up in the sunset on Irving and found a parking spot. I got out and right in front of me was Marnee. I hesitated and thought...Korean or Thai. Since I was by myself...I went for Thai. \n\nI was seated by, and I am guessing, the owner or mother of the place. She was so cute and boisterous. Very much added to the charm of the place. All of the servers took care and did a good job of getting food out quick and hot. \n\nI decided on the Silver noodle salad and yellow curry with chicken. The silver noodle salad was surprisingly spicy but amazingly delicious. The yellow curry was out of this world. I am salivating just thinking about it. I think I might need to make a special trip out there to try something else.", "author": "Andrea T."}

We must have walked in at the perfect time because after sitting down the place filled up quick!  We ordered the fried tofu appetizer and it was perfectly fried and super soft inside.  The dish came with two dipping sauces.  We also ordered the pumpkin curry.  They use kabocha instead of pumpkin which I prefer.  We got the dish vegetarian and it came with squishy tofu squares, more like the gluten stuff rather than tofu.  We also ordered the pad se ew, vegetarian.  There was so much food for the two of us we only ate a few bites of the noodles and took the rest home.  The bites of pad se ew was delicious though, with flavors of salty and a little sweet.  Yum!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-02", "description": "There are 2 main considerations for me when reviewing a restaurant:\n\n 1. The service.\nWe had reservations for a party of 8. We arrive on time, wait for about 5 minutes, then are shown a table. There are only 6 settings and chairs. We clarify that there are 8 of us. They tell us to go back outside and wait.  10 minutes later we're ushered back in. This time there are 8 place settings and only 5 chairs. A mild improvement. We stand around and the place is packed. It's probably over capacity in there, and i'm taking the opportunity to look around at what everyone else is eating ;). We finally flag down someone about the chair situation. The chairs trickle in. Slowly. We order quickly and watch as 2 other tables get shifted about. People who are seated are asked to move to other tables so they can rearrange. It seemed very disorganized, and would only fly at an Asian restaurant. On the plus side, the food basically came flying out. The tip is automatically calculated for parties of 6 or more, so there was no way to make a subtle comment about the wierd mixup with the table or having to stand around without chairs. 2.5 stars.\n\n2. The food.\nFinally I understood why I waited around so awkwardly. The food is pretty darn good! We went with Yelpers' recommendations and tried the papaya salad, green curry with beef and eggplant, angel wings and pad thai with shrimp. I was surprised that the angel wings weren't stuffed like other angel wings i've had before, but they were crispy and sweet. The beef in the curry was a bit chewy, but the eggplant soaked up the flavors perfectly. We also ordered from the specials menu: the mango fried rice and 2 orders of snapper. My favorite was the snapper with the garlic. If you're a garlic lover, you've gotta try it. I wanted to order the chilean seabass, but it's endangered and all...so...I decided against it. Of course I drank a Singha beer. 4.5 stars.\n\nIf you come on your birthday, they will turn out the lights in the restaurant, bring out some icecream with a lit candle and hit a gong. The whole place will sing to you. It's not every restaurant where you get a gong on your birthday.\n\nMy dad tried to chat it up with the owner. She was too busy and was having none of his banter. Of course she wasn't too busy to sell him her cookbook for $35. She informed us curtly that it was autographed by her husband.  Oh, and the angel wings recipe in the book isn't exactly what they serve at the restaurant. You know, that would be too easy!\n\nAll in all i'd come back! I'd have a reservation and make sure to wear some comfortable shoes with my \"laid back attitude\" hat on to match.", "author": "Krista F."}

Marnee would get 5 stars if they had not made the unfortunate choice of Westernizing the spice level of too many of their dishes, therefore really cooling a lot of their dishes down.  \n\nWhen we went with my Thai mother she asked Mai to make the Prik King with asparagus instead of green beans, and it was excellent.  The asparagus was perfectly cooked, the pork was tender, the sauce was not too oily.  We also had the beef salad-- the beef was perfectly cooked and it had lovely, well-balanced citrus and spice.  The calamari salad was equally impressive with fresh calamari without even a hint of rubberiness.  \n\nWe also had a lovely duck curry, and we actually ordered two dishes I have refused to order in a Thai restaurant for close to 10 years now: chicken satay and Phad Thai.  I normally wouldn't be caught dead ordering these two dishes, but they were suprisingly good - the satay was spicey, and the Phad Thai was not overly sweet-- a problem so many mediocre Thai restaurants and people who think they can cook Thai often make.  \n\nMarnee is excellent homestyle Thai food that really reminds me of my childhood.", "author": "AaronandMaureen B."}

The green curry lacked much flavor, while in the past it was rich, spicy, savory and one of the best I've eaten. Even worse, they had skimped on ingredients and didn't add the pumpkin or faux-chicken, as they always had done previously. The pad thai was AWFUL! I literally couldn't eat it! It tasted as if someone had dumped sweetened ketchup on boiled noodles; there was no texture, variety or complex flavor present at all.

We did have a very funny waitress. When we ordered duck salad she said \"Don't order duck salad that's better in the morning. I order you what I love.\" So we ended up ordering spicy duck instead, which was packed with flavor. Overall we had a good time there. :) best thai food i've had so far", "author": "Selina Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-27", "description": "The most authentic Thai cuisine can be eaten here! \nBesides the food, entertainment can be found here too, but you have to keep an open mind about it. \n\nMarnee, the owner, is a kind hearted and genuine person who will make sure your belly is content before leaving and treat you like family. For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day. There is another location on 9th Ave, but this one tastes the best in my opinion. 5 stars all across the board!", "author": "Hogan W."}

I'd probably order the green curry again and not the other two dishes.  Rice is extra at $1/bowl or $1.50 for brown rice.  They give you a piece of tamarind flavored candy with the bill.

Good service though, and the line to wait wasn't overly long (5-10 minutes for a table for 3 at 7:30pm on a Saturday, although we got stuck on a 2 person table)\n\nOverall, good place.

So much so that I only subtracted one star from its rating due to my own quirky personal sense of feng shui. I'm even going to go back. The service was very friendly and my water glass was always full. Everything was so beautifully presented. I especially liked how they made the interior look like a hut. The taste of the dishes was exquisite, as well as the generous portions. The nice, cool Tsing Tao was there to wash down the ginger chicken I had ordered.\n\nP.S.

Therefore, I decided to try it again to see if it was worth the ratings. It wasn't, in my opinion.\n\nI came in here during lunch on a weekday with two friends. It was 12:30, the place was half full, and we were ordering to go. I ordered Pad Kee Mao, and my friends ordered yellow curry and pad thai. \n\n1. They assumed we wanted dinner portions at 12:30 PM.. therefore, they charged us dinner prices for pad thai and pad kee mao..which we had to ask them to fix. At least ask us if we want lunch or dinner..\n2. They charged my friend for rice when she didn't even ask to have rice along with her yellow curry. Yes, usually people eat rice with curry, but i felt they shouldn't have assumed she wanted rice and charged her for it without even asking her. \n3. They seemed less than pleased about fixing their mistakes when they were at fault. \n\nBut you can't judge a restaurant solely on customer service, although a big part of a restaurant experience is customer service. Therefore, I decided not to jump the gun until I have tried their food.\n\n1. Pad kee mao: It was pretty good, a little tangy and light. Different than the stuff I've tried at other places but good nonetheless. Still, it didn't live up to it's ratings, critical acclaims, or the numerous awards adorning their wall stating that they were the \"best thai restaurant in the US\"\n2. Pad Thai: Also on the lighter side and seems to be based on the same ingredients used for the pad kee mao. \n3. Yellow Curry: Probably the best out of the three dishes we got. \n\nIN the end, food tastes good, but the thing is, I've eaten at lesser thai places in Berkeley (which has alot of thai restaurants i might add) that tasted similar to Marnee. Don't get me wrong.. I'm in no way a food snob nor a thai food expert , but i'm perplexed by the rave reviews of this place. To me, it seems pretty ordinary.

I know the economy isn't the greatest right now, so I get budget and staffing cuts.  But that doesn't seem to be the case with this restaurant.  There is sufficient staff here...yet after flagging down practically all the waiters and waitresses to let them know that we were ready to order, we were ignored.  As a last resort, we started to do the embarrassing display of waving the hands wildly around...to which the staff pretended to have a sudden narrow field of vision that did not include the party of eight sitting in the middle of the room.  I kid you not, TWENTY MINUTES LATER, a woman came to take our order.  Apparently, this ONE woman ONLY can take orders, hence the long wait...  Why?  Good question. \n\nNow, this may not have pissed us off so much if it wasn't for what had happened earlier.  We made a reservation at 7pm.  At 6:45pm, we arrived to confirm the reservation and to just let the hostess know that the party was there and that we'll just be waiting outside.  Well...7pm came around...and went.  We were then told that a smaller table was being set up but if we waited longer, then another table would open up.  Confused, we asked what happened to our reservation.  We were told some weird answer about \"customer turnover rate being slow\"...  HUH?!?!?!!!!  \n\nAt least the food was good, so that kinda made up for the sucky service.

I cannot believe I'd ever have to write a bad review for this restaurant. There's a reason why I order take-out, it's so that I don't have to sit and wait for my food to come out. Especially when I know that your restaurant will be busy. I called for take-out last night at 7:00pm--prime time for dinner I understand. But after placing my order of 5 dishes, you told me it would only take 20-25 minutes. I didn't get to the restaurant until 40 minutes after just so I don't have to stand there and wait while you pack my order. I come in and the staff that took my order said please wait in the back by the kitchen--only another 5 minutes. Okay--that's fine, I see some take-out containers...maybe those are mine. Then I see you pack them up and hand it to another customer. WTH? okay...all good...maybe the next one is mine. Another customer comes in and orders to-go, and somehow she got her order before I even see my 5 containers! WTH is going on here? I only ordered 5 dishes not 10!!!  I asked how much longer since I've already waited 10 minutes. And my take-out order is nowhere in sight. You tell me another 5 minutes--just one more dish. I wait 5 more minutes--at this point, my BF is waiting in the car and getting irritated and said to just ask for our money back. I asked nicely---and the lady owner said two more minutes. I said no thank you, I just want my money back--I don't feel like waiting another 15 minutes for my food. She kept insisting that it will only take 2 more minutes---OK, you've said that three time already--- 5 minutes passed. I started demanding for my money and she refuses to hand them over--almost done she said. WTF I have never had this experience anywhere, ANYWHERE! I just want my money back. This is ridiculous! It shouldn't take one hour for take-out! At this point the owner was screaming at her cooks to hurry-up and there's only ONE dish ready.

I got that giddy feeling like when I was a little kid and I knew Santa was going to bring me something wonderful.  I heard about the place on Check Please Bay Area where it got rave reviews. We headed over to check it out ourselves and boy did it hit the spot!   I'm not very knowledgeable about Thai cuisine or anything I just know that it tasted delicious. Every dish was exquisite.  The woman (May) who owns the place, runs the dining room.  She made me feel so fussed over even though it was busy.  If you want delicious Thai food in a warm, loving environment for a great value go to Marnee Thai.  I recommend the Samosas. And the Roti (dessert).", "author": "Hope C."}

We ordered the pad thai and pad kee mao and both were vegetarian.  Both dishes were super oily and the tofu seemed like it had been re-fried one to many times.  They both had minimal flavor and spice as well but the real reason behind the 2 star rating was the service or the lack there of.  We were seated promptly but after that, the waitress(owner) went around to several tables who had arrived after us to take their order before getting to us.  We also ordered a thai iced tea for my wife which never ultimately arrived.  The thing that really pissed us off was the fact that despite telling the waitress we were vegetarian, she still brought out the hot sauce with fish sauce and then after asking about it just took it away and brought out another hot sauce without muttering a single word.  As a vegetarian, I get the sense that this place has poor food separation standards and there is likely a lot of meat or meat by products that end up in the food which to me is not acceptable.

The 3 staff members kept yelling and talking to each other, with the women in screechy loud voices.  One of them screamed to another while pouring water and it was very unpleasant on my ears. Loud staff. The setting in the restaurant does not match the servers attitudes. The service was not good.  They were however extremely efficient in refilling water in the glasses. I had to get the waitress to stop as she zoomed past the table twice to ask for something. They are in an awful rush.  The man asked the table guests if they want more water from a distance, I guess he didn't have time to walk over.  Dropped the bill on the table without a word. Here's the kicker - when we asked for more rice since the initial serving was barely enough, she brought a large volume of rice but it was cold!!! And sticky. That's what I get for asking for more.  If you really want good Thai food and care about the service - go elsewhere.  They are not cheap either at $12+ a dish. The food was served on flat plates with a couple spoonful of gravy.  These dishes should have been served in a deeper bowl like plate with more gravy.  Wow they are really stingy. Nice decor but awful staff and service.", "author": "Jane S."}

I swear, Thai Spicy holds no meaning anymore...\n\nThis review is a little late because this happened a year back. Not sure if she's still there. Not like I will be coming back anytime soon to this location. It all started when me and a couple of friends got here and got a table. Up comes this short stocky lady that seemed overly nice. We thought this could be a nice dinner. WRONG! We ordered all our dishes and asked for THAI SPICY on about 3 of the 5. We thought they would know what we meant. The lady seemed like she understood because she seemed to acknowledge us with a ton of yes yes yes and a bunch of no worries!!!...So we thought cool and waited patiently while knocking back some sake. \n\nWhen the dishes came out we all noticed one thing wrong. Where's the strong aroma of hotness from the food? The steam vapor that wafts to your nose and is able to make you cry just from the scent? We kinda went through the food with our forks and noticed that the dishes we asked for Thai Spicy lacked the extra oomph that we ordered. So we flagged down the lady and asked her to take it back and spice it up some more. She said no problem and went to the kitchen to bring up back a jar of the pickled chilies they have. The green ones that are hot and sour. We kinda stared at her and wondered what the hell was wrong with her as she proceeded to tell us to mix the chilies in for extra spiciness. We were not amused at this point and asked her to make the dishes the way we wanted them. So she took them back to the kitchen and she came back and apologized for the mix up and her actions telling us that she takes pills and sometimes she gets like that. \n\nOne, never tell the patrons that you are on meds to keep yourself \"normal\". That will scare people away and not really give you any sort of sympathy.\nTwo, when a customers asks for a dish or dishes to be done a certain way, just do it. Don't try to bring something out and have us do a DYI on it. Tacky...\nThree, remember the customer is almost always right.\n\nApart from that little incident and the correct spice amounts back in the food, we were pleased with the meal.

NO!....No, not this place.....somebody say it isn't so!!!..please!\nSigh*  This was, and I say WAS one of the finest Thai restaurants I had ever visited.  I remember once having a ground chicken salad in a spicy/herbal marinade that was the stuff of poetry and song.  But that was two years ago.   Last Sunday my family and I were all in the mood for some palate stimulating Thai, so what better place than Marnee Thai, right?  Wrong.\n\nI remember the days of being greeted there by dainty Thai ladies dressed in those beautiful shimmery outfits, the kinds that make us ordinary western women feel like circus elephants.   This time, we were greeted and served by some woman of an entirely different ethnicity, who bluntly hurried us to order and then got all the orders wrong.  \n\n    My daughter, whose culinary adventures do not yet go to very exotic extremes, opted for ordinary Pad Thai.  Can't go wrong with that, right?  Wrong again.   These noodles were overcooked and simmered in a sauce consisting of loads of ketchup and vinegar and a dash of spices.  The chicken pieces in it were tiny and sparse, loaded in a more than generous amount of grease.\n\n   As she ate, I had ordered the coconut/chicken soup for the three of us, intending to think about my second dish while I slowly savored all the complex flavors of the soup.   However, I was soon to discover that this bowl was so small it was a joke to share with three people, but I did, and was left with a tiny bit of liquid in my tiny bowl and a few small pieces of chicken.   The other adult in our group was also taking his time trying to decide on his second dish, so he ordered a cup of coffee in the meantime.  A few sips afterward he tells me he thinks this is instant coffee.   I glanced up and saw that by the tiny kitchen they did indeed have a large jar of cheap, dollar store brand instant coffee.  Later, a trip to the bathroom where you have to cross the entrance to the kitchen, confirmed my eyes had not deceived me.   Honestly, wouldn't it be better for a restaurant to say they don't have coffee than to offer disgusting, chalky instant coffee?  But apparently these folks think that as long as they can charge for it, reputation be dammed.\n\n   We were so disgusted by everything we were experiencing that we just decided not to order anything else.  After getting our undeservingly overpriced bill, we left and headed for Clement street, where we went to Clement Dim Sum and satisfactorily put an end to our hunger.\n\n   So much for Marnee Thai - - and yet one more that bites the dust!", "author": "Alice C."}

The food is consistently yummy and my family and I dine there often.  This place is pricey though, so be ready to pay.  Marnee is very small and often crowded on weekends, so make reservations or get there early, otherwise you won't get in.  I've seen people wait outside until a few minutes before closing.

The service is great and the food is the best.\n\nI normally order the pad see ew and it's very very good. The texture of the noodle is very different compared to other Thai restaurants; it's kind of chewy but in a good way. The portion is huge, I normally can't finish the whole entree by myself. They have this really good multi-colored jalapeno hot sauce that goes really well with just anything.\n\nTheir Thai iced tea and coconut drinks are also really good. They serve the coconut juice on a whole young coconut which is really neat. \n\nThe service is amazing.

They have lunch specials but they dont come with soup as im used to thai lunch specials having. While the soup is meant for two they will let you get a half order (though the waitress couldnt tell me how much it would cost). As is usual for my first time at a thai place i ordered the pad thai. Looking at the tables of others it looks really good. One of the first impressions that i got from the place was the hot sauce they serve. It looks completely fresh, like they made it themselves. Ive not really ever seen that at an asian place, at least not the sauce you find on the table. Hopefully thatll be a good forebearance of what is to come! \n\nThe soup arrived in a cute but oddly shaped bowl. At first glance two things came to mind 1) thats a lot of oil floating in it and 2) thats a big half order of soup. The soup was very tasty. Lots of mushrooms and chicken. There was also a lot of lemongrass and ginger in it, garnished with cilantro. While eating the ginger is fine i would recommend not eating the lemongrass as it takes 50 chews to break it down enough to eat.\n\nNow the pad thai has arrived, it looked delicious, premixed for my pleasure, missing lime again though. Maybe thats a west coast thing? It smells delicious.\n\nFirst impressions. Everything tastes really good, a nice sweetness to it and a robust flavor with properly prepared noodles. Here is the downside, i asked for thai spicy, and i got mild. I reiterated it twice, she said she understood. Unfortunately this loses this restaurant a star.\n\nWell, i gotta give this place two stars. Becuase the only feeling i have right now is Meh. Did I mention the shrimp pad thai only had 3, count them, 3 shrimp and 5 pieces of shrivelled tofu? I didn't, well, I should have. Was it tasty, sure, but it wasnt much tastier than your normal place, the soup was the highlight of the meal...and the half order was 4.50 (versus 7 for the full). I wouldnt come back. My water was never refilled, i never got the lime i asked for and i was served mild pad thai. To top it all off the meal was 14 bucks. \n \nThis place has tons of potential, and maybe if id ordered different things id sing a different tune, but I won't give them another chance unless someone I'm out with really wants to go here.", "author": "H B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-21", "description": "Just got back from there tonight, and my tummy and senses are still RAVING over the great food we had there..\n\nUsually, my strategy in a Thai restaurant is to pick a chicken dish, an appetizer and a seafood dish and something random.    So for tonight, we  took a good friend of ours out on a visit from Chicago to Marnee.  For appetizer, we began with the Mango Salad.  I am traditionally not a big fan of Thai salads, but the excellent sweet flavor of the extremely light and tangy dressing was a great compliment for digesting all those veggies and a couple of cashews along for the ride. While munching, I wondered where the Mango was, 'til my wifey told me that all that shredded noodle-looking stuff was the Mango.. d'oh!  VERY GOOD.\n\nFollowing closely behind the salad was a traditional Pad Thai.  Excellent, and nutty, with a few huge prawns poking out amongst the noodles. Bravo to the chef for NOT drowning the Pad Thai in raw bean sprouts like other places.\n\nNext up from the kitchen was #35 - the Pad Cashew Nuts w/Chicken, comprised of sauteed sliced chicken with roasted chili, cashew nuts and long slivers of onion.  The sweet yet somewhat savory sauce that came with this completely put my taste buds onto cloud nine, or ten.. DEE-LEC-TA-BLE!!  (especially over the thai rice)  This dish was the sleeper surprise.. I thought... Pad Cashew nuts?  Sounds just like a yawner Chinese Cashew Chicken (blech) from Panda Express, but NOOO... THIS IS completely GREAT!  The dark sauce reminds me of a pepper shrimp dish I had back in S'pore.  Incredible.\n\nThe following two plates rounded out our meal:\n#44: Pad Phong Ka Ree, essentially sauteed prawns and scallops in a yellow curry, with eggs, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions tossed in.   I ordered this one as \"insurance\" to ensure we got something I liked, and the scallops were pretty good sized, tender and fresh along with the very fresh shrimp.  This dish did not disappoint, and the yellow curry was light, and the natural yummy compliment to the Thai steamed rice, which was a little dry for my taste. My wife also ordered the #27: Pad Kaprow - Pork  sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basils.  Minced pork - A teeny bit dry, but still very very good especially when you found the good stuff at the bottom of the serving plate.   The flavors in this place are TOPS.. NOT greasy, and after going to a series of inconsequential/disappointing SE Asian places, Marnee is definitely what I was hoping for but never really expecting.\n\nService - pretty quick, attentive and very friendly, yet not overbearing or intruding. The owner always checked up on us, and the whole place was packed tonight, even on a semi-rainy Wednesday evening in the middle of the work week.  Due to all seats/tables being filled, we waited about 8 minutes for our table for three.\n\nI'll definitely be back!  They earned their five stars as far as I am concerned.   Oh, and forget those one-review-hatchet-naysayers.  And nope. I  don't work for Marnee, nor am even a friend to anyone there, just a satisfied customer.", "author": "Harry W."}

After we sat down, it took them a little while to take our order, but I attribute that wait to attempting to seat a 13 person party.  Once they took our order, our food came out rather quickly.  The praram (chicken and vegetables in a peanut sauce) was very tasty, but then again, I always get that at any Thai restaurant and you can almost never go wrong.  Chicken would've been better if it was still a little juicier, but maybe it's just the way they cook the chicken for that dish.

My friend said it's a good thing I tried it there because theirs is the best.\n\nI am definitely looking forward to hitting up this place again.

We then devoured our spring rolls and two curries while watching for elbows and bodies.    \"Babe, done-- good,\"  whispered our hostess as she patted me on the back.  That was awkward  =P.  Afterward, we sat waiting for 15 minutes for our check.  Way to long!!\n\nOverall -- The food was traditional and yummy!  Even though there was too much mint, I left satisfied.  Enjoyed the environment, but it was a little bit too tight.  The hostess and her staff were welcoming, busy, entertaining, and noisy.  Even though it took a while to be seated and to receive the check, I will definitely come back when I'm craving some thai.\n\nDon't get intimidated by the crowd and leave you'll be chased by the hostess yelling  \"Don't leave, we'll fit you.  I'll make space.\"", "author": "romeo b."}

One my first and last visit to Marnee Thai, it was a Saturday around 5:30PM.  Ordered 3 entrees + rice.  When my bowl of rice arrived, it was *cold* and hard - clear evidence it wasn't fresh, i.e. made that day/evening.  The waiter was not around, so I flagged the woman/owner and informed her the rice was cold & old.  Mind you, this was done politely.  Her response: \"What's the matter, it's good enough for you.\"  She did not offer a new bowl of rice.  We waited for all of the entrees to arrive, asked for take out boxes, packed it up and settled the bill.   Obviously, no tip was left on the table.

I have been eating Thai for at least 17 years & have been to over 200 Thai restaurants, so I have a lot to compare to & this place was pretty bad. Lemme start by stating that the taste of the food was good, average, but good...it was the service that was really odd & that made it so I'd never return. Firstly, they seemed to have just learned how to wait on people as they hadn't a clue what they were doing. They were awkward and would laugh at odd moments. Brought our appetizer last and what they brought first was something we didn't order. Had to ask twice for my beverage. Entrees came right before our appetizer and the whole process just to get everything we ordered was around 45min. The restaurant itself smelled like wet dog. I think it was the smell of all the material they used to create their faux hut which didn't go well with a food place. Basically it attempted to cover up for the fact that this is a total hole in the wall.", "author": "Unicorn U."}

Ok in English to the customers. Where to start...\nThere's always a wait for this place, so yesterday, my friend had enough foresight to make reservations. She arrived at 7:05 for the 7:00 reservations, and because we were missing 3 out 5 of the party (circling for parking b/c parking is a b*tch), the owner lady gave our table away. The other half our party arrived a minute later after my friend watched her give our table away. So we wait 20 minutes...\nThen we get seated. After a few minutes owner lady comes to take our order. She asks,\"What would you like?\" Someone at the table opens his mouth about to spit out our order, when she turns away and starts yelling in Thai to the other staff, starts yelling to the other customers where to sit, etc. This happens 3 times or so during the course of ordering. Can you spend the 1 minute to take our order without interruptions?! This happened last time I ate here too. That's just rude. Yelling every time we're about to tell you our order. BAD SERVICE.\nAfter we order, about 2 minutes later, owner lady wants to move us to a different table. After we've ordered, had our water, and settled in. She moves us to make space for a party of seven, and shoves us into a tiny table next to the wall, meant for 4. I'm at the \"head\" of the table, and the whole meal, the wait staff and the PLUMP lady, who really shouldn't squeeze between that tiny space, keep pushing past the back of chair to get through.

Perhaps I have a different preference of how Thai food should taste. This seems to cater to the mild tongues and those that are not used to the shrimp paste and fish sauces. \n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, the first thing I noticed were the straw thatched walls..interesting hut-like environment. At the time we came in, there weren't too many people but I do suggest that you make reservations if you come around 7 or so (thats when it gets really busy)\n\nFor appetizers, we had corn cake because it looked so good at the other table. It was tasty like E&O but the batter was not as crispy. I did like the cucumber salad that was served with it. Yum. We had chicken larb salad which didn't really taste that great. It was salty, as if they put in a crushed chicken bouillon cube in there. I haven't come across a really good larb in the bay area. Moving on... We had Mussamun Curry Beef that was nice and smooth. The meats were pretty chunky along with the potatoes. I would order this dish again. Pad woonsen with pork was ok. The silver noodles was good but the rest of the ingredients didn't seem to impress me since the flavor was all soaked up in the noodles. I can't remember the last dish but it was a spicy shrimp dish that wasn't spicy even though we wanted this to be more medium. All of our dishes other than the shrimp dish were supposed to be mild but they weren't even spiced as far as I could taste. I don't know if I would come here again since the food was not really a stand out for me.\n\nI do however think that service was great and they are good at refilling water. Its a quaint little place and if you're a first timer in trying thai food, then this is the place. If you've graduated to a higher level of spice and more exotic flavors, you might want to look elsewhere. The price could be cheaper considering the area. There's places in the southbay that I enjoy going to that are tastier with the same price point. Sad to say.. I'm not interested in putting this in my places to go list.", "author": "Luna L."}

An advice: the wrapping procedure will give you enough time to understand when you are full without having to stuff yourself. Very nice food presentation that makes you feel at a gourmet restaurant. Fortunately then the bill is not as expensive as at gourmet restaurants at all;) One star less because the fried noodles that my bf ordered had a fishy smell, but maybe it was supposed to be like that...", "author": "Laura C."}

T and I finally settled the age-old dispute of Which Marnee Came First by asking our waitress. The answer, all ye seekers of the light of truth, is that the Irving Marnee came first. \nThe atmosphere is more intimate than the 9th ave Marnee, with cool woven mat walls and roof and fresh orchids all over the place. At one point it seemed a little too intimate, with our neighbors nearly on top of us, but we were almost done at that point so no big deal. The food was very good, we tried a new spicy seafood dish that was just ok, but the beef with green beens and the praram pak were most excellent. As with the other Marnee, the service was average. \nTrying the Marnee on Irving is a great way to try to get over your fear of the sunset while retaining the comfort of something you know, like Marnee's green curry.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

Also this t-rex looking waitress bullied my table into ordering things that we didn't want to get, which werent even that good. We let her bully us since the last time i went, we didn't order anything she suggested and ended up getting horrible service. The food is good, service is decent. They were very good about refilling waters. I'd recommend going, but its hard to not get pushed into order certain dishes since the lady basically thinks ur ordering it once she mentions it. Seriously she was annoying, some may consider that good service, but i think its just annoying. If you want to eat food from this place, you must sit and order. There were people who called in and went to pick up the food and still waited for like an hour. I saw 2 customers complaining about having to wait for an hour their even though they already called half an hour before arriving. \n\nOverall, I think the place is pricy, but you do get good food. Service has its + and -'s. Its worth going there to form your own opinion about the place cause i can see how people's opinions differ at this place.", "author": "Jay L."}

My favorites are the cucumber salad, the spring rolls, and the yellow curry.  YUM.  Also, there is a woman who works there, who is a hoot.  She tells you what she thinks you can order.

The somosa is very under-rated and a must try. Nicely fried with the sweet and sour sauce to dip it in. The Beef salad is great, my wife says it's too salty. Blah, Blah blah Charlie Brown I think it's great. The Juices off the beef adds a little more zing to the dressing on the rest of the greens. For a little extra kick they have this great hot pepper sauce mix with chopped peppers readily available on the table for you to enjoy or over indulge. The owner, who's a lovely lady shouted across the restaurant as she saw me pouring her pepper concoction onto my plate saying, \"not spicy enough?!\" I shook my head and said \"nope\". Try it, it's especially great with the BBQ chicken and love the Panang Beef. The dessert is also done right but we fill up so much on apps and mains we often miss the Mango Sticky Rice or Fried banana.

I love the chan pad poo, which is this wonderful dish of pad thai noodles, crab, egg and jalapenos and you can't get this dish anywhere else. I love the tom kha and the tom yum soups. Just the right mix of spicy and coconuty/sour and lots of veggies. They make the best chicken satay I know of. Silver noodles, barbeque chicken, fried fish, garlic spinach... they're all so good! Why can't they fit a big group of people in here so I had enough people to order all the great dishes at once??\nAnd the curries, how do I love thee? Yellow, red, and particularly the pumpkin squash curry which is like a mix of red curry and peanut sauce. By the way, the pumpkin curry isn't on the menu, but they'll make it for you if you order it. The pumpkin curry is my favorite. \nAnd although I can never save room for desert, if you have more discipline than I, GET THE MANGO AND STICKY RICE. It's amazing.", "author": "Melly B."}

My only complaint is that the degree of spiciness has been toned down for the Western palate. Even when I speak to them in Thai and ask for it phet mak (very spicy), the food comes with only a tease of heat. Still only worth half a star of demerit.

There are actually two locations, but the one I am reviewing was the original. The restaurant is small but cozy. There were some decorative colored lights strung from th ceiling. Each table had an orchid and candle, and the lighting is dim. We got there at 7:30 and it was pretty crowded, so we were lucky to have made a reservation. The staff was very attentive and friendly. We started out with some kind of tea which tasted like Korean \"bori-cha\" or barley tea. The tom yum soup was very good and very very spicy (I asked for it, and I got it) with lots of vegetables and tofu. Then came the \"spicy\" angel wings which were deep fried chicken wings with crispy basil and a sweet sauce. They were not spicy, despite their name. Nevertheless, very tasty, as fried things tend to be. Then came the pad see ew (with chicken) a dish, along with tom yum, that I nearly always get at thai restaurants, so I am quite a pad see ew conaisseur. This one was quite good I must say, the noodles were sweet and properly seasoned. After the noodles, we got beef panang curry. I was not that impressed. Although the sauce was good, there was not enough of it. I am used to curries in which the meat and/or veggies are covered in sauce. This dish had slices of meat and broccoli, with a bit of sauce on the side. I also thought the beef tasted too meaty, it would be nice if they had a chicken or vegetarian version. Perhaps they do, and next time I will try that. The mango and sticky rice was okay, but not as good as when I make it at home, or at other thai restaurnants (like President Thai in Pasadena). Overall Marnee is one of the better Thai places in the city, and I would come back again.", "author": "Kate A."}

When three more guests arrived the table for 12 was still not ready.  After 10 more minutes, she sat us at a long table with hardly any room to wiggle.  Our reservation was at 6:15 p.m., and they didn't seat us until 7:30 p.m.  Once we ate and were settling down for a little conversation, at 9 p.m., we were told to LEAVE BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS WAITING FOR THE TABLE.  \n\nHOW RUDE.

I ordered a chicken dish and instead they brought me shrimp. It could have been an honest mistake or maybe they were trying to increase my bill. Who knows? Anyway, when I (politely) informed them of the mistake and asked them to send it back and bring me chicken, they started giving me a hard time. I assume this is because I am a young guy and I was there with my girlfriend (who is now my wife). Maybe they didn't consider me an important guest since my bill was not that high. Anyway, some big mama-san came out and started speaking to me in a condescending manner about refusing to accept the prawns. She finally gave in and told me she would give my prawns to her kids at home who are not so picky. First off, I am young professional in my 20s. I am not your kids at home. That is incredibly disrespectful and I wanted to choke her fat neck. Secondly, it was their mistake not mine. Most respectable restaurants try to correct their mistakes and make their guests happy. Not this fat piece of human garbage. Even with her broken english she knows how to insult and disrespect her customers. She seems very arrogant and thinks she is running a 5 star restaurant. She has a group of her favorite customers who she bows and scrapes to, and she treats the rest of us like we are unimportant. She feels that she can treat people how she wants and they will still come to gobble up her thai slop. So far, much to my surprise, she has been correct in that assumption.. Very shady restaurant if you ask me. This is the first negative restaurant review I've ever felt compelled to write. That's how bad this place is.", "author": "Vince L."}

Everything was presented beautifully and tasted great and the service was excellent and very friendly from the servers to the owners.  The first thing you notice about each dish is how fresh the ingredients are.  The Mian Kum appetizer was a wonderful example of this.  Fresh spinach leaves that you top with shredded coconut, onions, fresh diced ginger, peanuts, sliced lime, dried baby shrimp and their sauce which are laid out for you.  It was awesome and like nothing Ive had before this is the dish that I left thinking about.  Next up that I have to mention were the imperial rolls which were delicious, crisp and flaky.  I cant say Ive ever had better.  Chicken satay was good and the peanut sauce great.   The Thai Samosas were my dad's favorite.  Green mango salad, very good.  The Gang Jued soup was also great.  Their curries we ordered were both good, but not the stars of the meal.  And lastly I have to recommend the mango sticky rice for dessert.", "author": "Michael M."}

When Marnee is there, she'll make sure you order well, that the sauces are not all the same for the different dishes you order.  The curries - whichever you try, and I've tried a few - are all perfect - flavorful with a little heat but not too much.  Last time I was in we ordered the shrimp and green beans with a red sauce - again, plenty of flavor, just a little heat, but the pepperiness didn't overwhelm it at all.  I love Thai tea, but last time tried a coconut milk drink served right in a coconut which was just as refreshing and wonderful a contrast to the spicy food as the Thai tea without being too sweet.  I would take anyone here - romantic enough for a date, festive enough for a group.  It can get a little crowdy though, not much elbow room, so best to get there early.", "author": "Sophie B."}

Menu is very extensive, reasonably priced, and there's a specials board and an additional specials menu. I discovered the corn cake starter and could eat these 'till the cows come home. I always judge a Thai restaurant on how well it makes a green curry and they certainly didn't disappoint here. Of course, being American, I had to ask for it to be made a little more spicy and, when it came, it hit the spot perfectly. The owner and her staff were very helpful and the corn cakes were their recommendation. Service was good and prices were perfectly reasonable (for SF that is).

And lets be real, this isn't a fine dine place like Fleur de lys for it to have tiny artistic portions, it's just another homie restaurant on Irving and yet they're frugal about their portions. \n\nI, as always, ordered the peanut chicken dish (i forgot the actual name) and my friend ordered deep fried crab over a bed of salad. In all fairness, their food usually tastes good.

Now please people, we all know what fresh deep fried anything tastes like; it's crispy and hot. Knowing that any decent restaurant in sf would gladly take back it's food if something was wrong with it, my friend and i agreed to tell the hostess/ waitress/owner. So we expressed our thoughts to the lady expecting that she would simply apologize and order another dish for us but instead she starts arguing and telling us how freshly deep fried the crab is. Soon after, she goes into the kitchen and starts screaming at the chef in Thai and comes back and offers us to reheat the crab in the MICROWAVE for us! even a diner wouldn't say that to you in SF!Come on people, you CAN tell the difference between a freshly fried french fry and an old stale french fry, how hard is it to tell the difference between a newly fresh fried crab and an old fried crab that was made at lunch?! she was extremely rude, we're giving you business and supporting your restaurant and instead you come screaming at my face and get angry?! \n\nso as i tried just forgetting about it and tried to enjoy the rest of my time left with my friend, she has the nerve to come by to ask me how our meals are and tries to flatter me by saying how big and beautiful my eyes are! lady, i don't care, you ruined my night and put my friend and i in a bad mood on a Friday night!!!!!!!!!! \n\n\n\n\nAll i wanted was a decent dinner to enjoy my night with my friend. \nI live in a city that offers amazing food where ever you go, i know what good service and fresh good food is! \n\n\nNEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN!", "author": "Setareh s."}

The place is small though, but they did open up a new location on 9th ave. I think I've been to that one once. It was slightly worse but still good. The owner is kind of loud but friendly. I believe pretty much everything I've tried is good. Do they have mango rice here? If they do, I liked it. =)", "author": "Luke F."}

One of my cousins advised this place was really good for authentic Thai cuisine. The food was decent, but I prefer Osha Thai. Also, the wait was ridiculous! Our reservation was for 7pm and we did not get seated until 8pm or a little later. The place is just way too small. We got a somewhat larger table than other people, but we were still squished. My chair kept getting bumped into by the waiters and waitresses. It was quite annoying. The owner (I believe) was quite loud and pushy. We wanted to order just one order of the angel wings, but she insisted that we order more than just one order and of course it was way too much. I was also disappointed in their panang curry. Usually when I order this dish, there is a lot of curry sauce that comes with it. This dish hardly had any. When I asked the owner if that was the correct dish, she said that is how panang curry is made. That may be so, but why doesn't she explain that in the menu. Also, why does everyone else make a lot of sauce with it and this restaurant is the only place that does not give a lot of curry sauce with it. The rest of the food was decent, but I was expecting so much more. I may go here again if I am in the area, but most likely not.", "author": "Kimberly L."}

The staff is very friendly, though often rushed.   Best to go late in the afternoon for more relaxed dining.   Haven't been to their other location since I've been such a fan of this restaurant.", "author": "Ken J."}

Two stars for the food, which, admittedly, was really good. 5 of us came here last night and everything we tried was good (pad thai, veggie deluxe with chile-basil sauce, papaya salad). All of it was good. So why only 2 stars? The service was horrendous. First (and this would have been forgivable were it not for the incident at the end of the night), I had called to see if I could make a reservation since there were 5 of us and was told yes. So, why did I bother to give them info for making a reservation when they were going to do nothing to reserve a table for us!? We arrived a couple of minutes before 8 (the time of our reservation) and ended up getting seated at 8:30. Um, doesn't the concept of a reservation rely on actually reserving a table!? Ok, moving on. The service was abrupt and inattentive the whole time, with the waitress moving on to the next person before the person doing the ordering was even finished.  The end of the meal, though, was the real kicker. Our bill came and, given that we couldn't read anything that was written on the bill, we all used the menu, with prices, to add up how much we owed. When our total came up $15 short, I asked our waitress if she could explain the bill.  First of all, they had added a $1 charge per person for rice when only one person asked for any (or ate it). Seemed odd given that 2 of us had pad thai and certainly neither ordered or wanted rice and one person only had dessert. Hmmm.. Then when she got to two of the items we ordered the prices were two dollars higher each than what was printed on the menu. When I pointed this out, she said \"ok she would take it off\", with no apology or explanation. It was as if she was saying, ok, since you realized that we added extra amounts on for each dish, I'll take it off. Unbelievable.  I'm quite sure there were other \"errors\" on our bill, but we were sick of dealing with it so we just paid and left. There are far too  many good thai places in this city to put up with this kind of bullshit, good food or not! We won't be back.", "author": "SL N."}

Since that time in Oct 1998, I've been eating at this restaurant at least once a month.  I've taken everyone here and no one else has told me that another Thai restaurant serves better food than Marnee Thai does.  I've become very fond of the owners and enjoy their service and food there.  Whether you are a regular or not, you'll find the food to be spectacular.  Mind  you, this is not a fine dining sort of place nor are you going to expect your typical type of \"American\" style restaurant service there.  My favorite dishes that I always get there are: Green Papaya Salad or Green Mango Salad, Pad Thai with Shrimp, whole fish with spicy sauce, and pad pra ram.  You've got to try the Roti with ice cream and the Mango Sticky Rice.  Marnee Thai knows how to make me and my belly happy!!!  Five Stars to Marnee Thai", "author": "storm o."}

All their traditional stuff (pad Thai, friend rice, basil chicken) is fab but I love to get my spicy on when I eat Thai so I try to order the curries as much as possible.  Every single one is great and unique in flavor - whether its the chicken, vegetable or lamb its ALL GOOD!  I am also the biggest sucker on the planet because I totally bought the \"cookbook\".  I do cook pretty well so it's not the saddest thing but I have yet to make something.  It has all the recipes though, so hopefully I will update my post soon with my newly found Thai skills.", "author": "Kristina C."}

Our favorite dishes here are the Pad Nor Mai (ground pork sauteed with chili, garlic, bamboo shoots, egg, and Thai basils) and Pad Thai.  The dishes are ALWAYS perfectly seasoned, with the ideal combination of freshness and spice.  Not to mention it is affordable.  When we are feeling lazy, I just order three or more orders of my favorite dishes, and take it to work all week for lunch.  Love Marnee.  You must give it a chance.

We ordered two dishes:  spicy wings which were not fresh and chicken with string beans which were so oversalted that I couldn't eat it.  I don't usually complain about my meal but since I couldn't eat either item, I told the waitress who was the owner.  She started arguing with me in a booming voice that the cook had been there 20 years and had I wanted less salt on my food, I should have informed her when I ordered.  I like salt but this was permeated with salt.  She then walked away and 5 minutes later came back and said she would give me new wings but only half an order and if I wanted dessert.  We got new wings that were fresh.  So I mostly ate the rice.  She also wanted us to order a third dish which we didn't and she wasn't happy about that.  While we were there another party of 6 sat down and after she went over to speak to them, they left without ordering.  They appeared to be upset.", "author": "Nora S."}
