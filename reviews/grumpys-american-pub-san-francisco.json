The staff was friendly for our afternoon weekday lunch. A couple stray Giants fans were there for pregame festivities as well as businesspeople from the nearby warehouse district offices. Your best best here is a cold beer and a burger, however neither of those were on my wishlist (pescatarian and a lot of work sitting back at my desk). I ordered an iced tea to drink which was constantly refilled by the waitress. Our group started with mozzarella stick appetizers and potato skins. Both were a hit but nothing spectacular. For lunch I went with the grilled salmon salad. The portion size was very large but the salad was very blah. Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, grilled salmon with the skin on, and balsamic vinaigrette. Flavor was lacking on the fish and I wish the salad would have had avocado, cheese, and or some summer fruit. It is served on a large plate but the salad was easy to finish as it was mainly just lettuce. Those who ordered bacon cheeseburgers at my table were much more satisfied and they could barely choke down half of their meal without loosening the belt buckles. \n\nDon't come here for the food, come here for the environment and to drink beer. A great sports bar. On the plus side, it's open for private events if you want to rent out the entire space.\n\nUPDATE: we have all our boozy work lunches here. It's surprisingly popular. This time I went with the beet salad and added salmon. It was much better than the grilled salmon salad! Also had a glass of rose which was way too sweet for me but you can't really expect much in terms of wine at this establishment.", "author": "Kara N."}

It is so rare to get service like the service we received during a busy lunch hour, let alone any other time of day!  If I could give ten stars for the service at Grumpy's it still wouldn't be enough. \n\nWe walked in the door to a packed room a little after 1 pm, but were seated right away. I had barely taken a breath before we received a menu and our drink order was taken. Another breath barely escaped my lips before the drinks were on the table. Kaboom!\n\nAlthough the place was packed and music was playing, it wasn't too loud. In fact, it was just right. It was too cool to sit outside, but we got a table next to the front door which may have helped a bit with the noise level. Either way, it was just right. \n\nOur food came out almost as fast as the drinks and it was piping hot. To say that the chili cheese burger was good is an understatement. It was out of this world delicious. And the fries were so tasty!

I guess this place is pretty popular for happy hours for those working around the financial district. \n\nService: \nPretty spotty service as you order up front and then someone brings your food. Given that the place is always packed, expecting fast service isn't going to happen. It's always good to order a drink at the bar too so you can sip on something while you wait. \n\nFood:\nI opted for something small since I wasn't sure how bar food was going to be like. \nBacon Mac & Cheese: You can't go wrong with anything that has bacon on it. Even though it was listed on the \"extra\" section of the menu, the portion was pretty filling. I could barely finish the whole thing myself. It was toasty on the outside with a cheesy crunch which is the best way to make mac and cheese imo. The bacon was nicely scattered and gave it the salty goodness that goes superb with cheese. \n\nDrinks:\nThey didn't make jagerbombs with beer (which may or may not be an actual drink...) but they substituted it with coke which was good too. Jager + coke = no alcohol taste, so you can easily drink it like water..or soda. \n\nOverall: \nI would definitely come back if I'm in the area, parking can be hard to find though.

I highly recommend you try this place out!\n\nFOOD\nWestern Burger with Garlic Fries (Turkey, lettuce, tomato, onions, bacon, cheddar)...$11.50\n\nStarting with the turkey patty, its was so moist and seasoned perfectly.  It somewhat tastes like chicken, which is great because turkey is a little leaner of a meat.  Next the bacon, it came with around 3 slices.  I loved the fact that the slices of bacon were actually cooked completely through, it's horrible when there is that layer of fat that you get a little piece of and want to vomit after (maybe that's just me).  The shoes string onions were great, nice and thin and not overpowering.  \n\nSERVICE\nI went here with my friend for lunch during a workday.  Previous times there were a ton of people and a little wait but surprisingly we were seated right away.  We ordered our food and within 10-15 minutes it arrived at the table.  Someone checked in twice for water refills.  Overall the service was good.  \n\nAMBIANCE\nIt pretty darn cool in there.

The only reason I don't rate it higher is because the acoustics are terrible and they tend to play the music way too loud. Makes it really hard to have a conversation with your colleagues during your lunch hour. Service is good. Not always exact. If you try to make too many substitutions the cook seems to get confused.

That left the poor bartender, who was super nice and was doing his best to get us square away, to serve our party of 6 plus the few other couples that wandered in. We weren't more than 5 feet from the bar, but it meant that every time we wanted to order a drink or order  appetizers that we had to go up to the bar and put in the order. After the first 30 minutes, the bartender then came out and took our dinner order (to be honest, it was when he realized that no one else was going to do it who should have been taking care of us and took it upon himself to fix it). \n\nWhen I have to watch someone polish wine glasses and set a table with candles and a white table cloth while waiting 15 minutes for someone to come over and ask if we want a drink  - there's something wrong. Oh and did I mention that we even started to bus our own table? Meanwhile, there were custom made plates of off-menu items being rolled out to his private party.\n\nI hope that the owner reads this - and DO NOT take it out on your bartender, not his fault and he was flawless with us.

I should add that I am a vegetarian, but I found that they do happen to have a few solid options on their menu. That being said, the overall experience fell very short. \n\nI arrived with my group, and asked what was in their veggie burger, and they had absolutely no clue. I don't really feel like paying $15 for some questionable frozen patty when I go out to a restaurant. You should know what ingredients are in your products, even if they aren't made in-house. Weird moment #1. \n\nI decided on a Portobello mushroom with some yummy-sounding burger fixins on a bun, along with some zucchini fries. Shortly after, they bring out drinks for everyone (they had all ordered beer, lemonade, etc.), but didn't bring any water for me to the table. I know we're in a drought, but they could have at least asked if I'd like water when I placed my order. Weird moment #2. \n\nAbout 15 mins after we order, someone comes out and informs me that they're out of Portobello mushrooms. Normally this wouldn't be a huge deal, although it's a little disappointing, but it would have been nice to know sooner. I decided to switch to a beet salad with a side of zucchini fries. Weird moment #3. \n\nFinally we received our food, and the salad was ok, but ultimately I could have made it at home. It was a lot of spinach and shredded carrots, with very few beets, and hardly any Gorgonzola. Literally a tiny sprinkle of cheese...come on that's the protein! It's the equivalent to getting one little slice of chicken on a Caesar salad. To make matters even worse, they never even brought me the zucchini fries. So I literally received 0% of the food I had originally ordered. Even if they took it off the bill, it was just a bad experience. Weird moment #4, and I was done.

A burnt patty did not look appetizing to eat, nor did it taste good either. The outer edges of it were crispy  and black, which kind of killed the burger. The fries were pretty good though, I mean you can't mess up fries that badly right? But yeah they said this and another burger was the most popular.

However, I was there solely to try the bacon cheeseburger. Fortunately, they acknowledged the burger section as the best part of Grumpy's menu. Keep in mind that we're talking pub food; fanciness isn't expected, but rather good quality for a good price. \n\nYou can't help but like a bar full of local media/advertising people who want to talk about anything but work. Personal pinions spill out after being sewn in by a long day of objective or targeted speech. Grumpy's is a straightforward local pub that will continue to be popular for years. And while my fun experience there made me want to like the burger a lot, I can't say it's one of my favorites from this burger quest over the past nine months.\n\nThe sesame bun was average and the patty itself was cooked medium rare, not medium as ordered. That's ok, because the bacon was present in every bite, and the juice from the patty and toppings filtered down to my fries, just as I'd hoped. The fries themselves were decent, roughly on par the burger. \n\nOverall, Grumpy's should never disappoint, especially if you get a burger there. Go there for a beer and stay for a couple more.

It was a little bit of a trek but well worth it.  Our standard is basically the Royal Exchange which is pretty good with a solid beer selection and decent food.  In my mind RE is three stars, which is average, so my review will be in comparison to that.\n\nThe beer selection at Grumpy's was not as expansive as RE's but they definitely had a good selection (Anchor, Lagunitas IPA, Dos Equis, Hef, etc.) so for me Grumpy's held par.  The place is much smaller and had quite the lunch rush, but we still were able to walk right in at 1 pm on Friday and get seated. Our order was taken promptly enoug and our beers came out ahead of our meal.\n\nI got a burger, medium rare, and my friend got a \"Manhattan\" which was kind of like a club sandwich.  He reported that it was good. My burger was also very good. Perfectly sized in that I could have eaten more but didn't need to.  The cheese was quality aged chedder and the bacon was perfectly cooked.  The fries were also good (I would have wanted more on the plate, but didn't NEED more).  The burger and sandwich were about $10/each.  Beers were $5/pint.\n\nI was able to get my meal, two beers and out in about an hour which is the perfect time.  The place is kind of loud but it was busy and not to the point we were annoyed.\n\nGrumpy's is a little out of the way, but worth the walk on a nice day. It's about 10 minutes from the Financial District.  If I was in between RE and Grumpy's, I would probably choose Grumpy's 80% of the time.

That side salad could have been a meal on its own. Other than salad, you could choose fries, onion rings, or if you're like the lady who sat next to me, mozzarella sticks with your sandwich.

Between this, Old Ship and RJ's Market (which is pretty good) we found ourselves polarized by the convenience of Grumpys. So that said, my ramble below pertains only to lunch experiences.\n\nSo, once you get your head and belly into a \"sandwiches, burgers and salads\" type of mindset, the place delivers. To date, I've stayed on the middle-of-the-road path with the menu (classic cheeseburgers with fries or a side salad, grilled chix sandwiches, tuna melts,  cobb salads, beet salads, etc.) and ALL of that grub was prepped and served up really well. Proteins were fired to perfection at the right temps, fries were crisp and soft on the inside with great seasoning, salads were big and put together with a mix of toppings and textures to make even something so basic, still delish. You actually catch yourself thinking, \"wow, the food here is pretty damn good.\"\n\nAND...mind you, I haven't even tried any of the Signature Burgers (15+ gourmet burger types from the Baja to the Popeye), the chicken parm, the turkey plate, other fancier salads or any of the bar-food apps. SO, I can only imagine this place gets better and better. The bartender was talking me into the chili-cheese fries, which are supposed to be damned good, but I was already two beers down and needed to head out for a meeting.\n\nWhich brings me to booze, staff and ambiance. Booze: great beers on tap and affordable hard liquor bevvies and happy hour specials. Great place for liquid lunches - ding ding ding.  Staff: Welcoming and friendly, just as we all like. In the mad rush, they can get a bit busy so sometimes it can feel a little slow (in the kitchen or front of house) but they keep up for the most part and do it with coolness, kindness and smiles. Ambiance: Hell, it's a pub/barfood joint. If you're looking for tablecloths and a sommelier then you might keep on steppin'. BUT, if a pile of kegs in the corner, a bunch of tables crammed edge to edge, Sportscenter on on the TVs, Foo Fighters (yes Dave Grohl gets loud when they come on in there for some reason) rockin' in the background and great food at a great price...go get you some Grumpys. \n\nAnd, if you figure out what the hell the bulldog with the fern leaf logo is all about, you win free Grumpys for life.

Coming here, I now know why.\n\nPlacing the batsignal to prison fodder Hueyn/Mindy, we arrived to a packed bar.  Grumpy's is a very small area and on the initial scan, this place reminded me of the mythical Tortuga.  At the bar, you see full-blossomed strumpets laughing at every joke of their consorts, vying for attention and hopefully, another drink, slyly letting their robust chest touch said man's arm from time to time.  Ahhh..the power of female wiles.  Basically, for you Davis alumni, this is Cantinas del Cabo in the daytime.  The manager was very gracious despite the crowd and rush of orders, ushered us to our table in a timely fashion.  I ordered the Baja burger while Mindy ordered the Western burger.  Our waitress was brisk and curt, understandable with the lack of manpower here, and could not engage in banter.  My gripe with this place is that the food took forever which seems to be a reoccurring theme among it's clients.  The problem with this is two fold:\n1.  one gets extremely hungry\n2.  most importantly, if your company is with somebody similar to Huyen/Mindy and his stories of getting turned out in prison become trite and downright sick, the conversation becomes rather stale and there is only so many people you can text or pretend to check time.  jk jk\n\nThe burgers finally came out and by that time, I was too famished to really enjoy the burger.  This burger, similar to the Old Ship, is more of a bar burger.  There is nothing gourmet about it.  It drips grease and the bun becomes soaked quickly.  I prefer my buns toasted. The patty was large but devoid of any robust flavour.  I found the picca de gallo to be underwhelming...the salsa wasn't distinct.  There was a minimal amount of seasoning...again..this is just your salt and peppered'd hamburger patty.  This is not your 7x7 Top Burgers that cost $15-20.  The fries were your traditional American salted fries..soggy but with ketchup and ranch, the perfect complement to a meal.  The bacon was thick and bountiful and the bottom line was that it was food for the soul, good to coat the lining of your stomach for an impending le twist adventure.  You will come to Grumpy's leaving without its namesake emotion.  The burgers are old fashioned and simple and takes me to a childhood when I did not know of finer things in life such as brie, fried egg, goat cheese condiments.  Sometimes it is better that one does not know.  They also have a $7 special during happy hour consisting of a shot of jamison and a brewski.  Drinks to the most delectable cutlet at the bar...wadDUUP.", "author": "Brian V."}

But a great place for drinks with friends and to let loose.\n\nA group of 8 from the office went to try this place on recommendation of a very outspoken female co-worker. We sat inside, occupying 2 tables. We ordered 6 different burgers + one chicken, and one sandwich suggested by the waiter (I think it was ham & cheese, but I don't remember) for one of the girls (all ~$8, w/choice of: fries, potato or green salad). It took a while to get our order, after several rounds of beers & sodas.\n\nTo make the story short, I'm the only one who finished my burger (I was hoongry!!). Everyone in the group agreed that it wasn't very good. They gave me a weird look because my plate was clean - and I had to keep explaining that I was hungry. The co-worker lost all credibility on choosing our next lunch spot, but her knowledge about places in which to get drunk remains unmatched (she knows the bartenders by name).\n\nTip for inexperienced office workers (thought it was needed, after reading some reviews): Whenever we go to lunch in a group we pool our cash together to pay the bill and tip, or one person picks up the tab and we divide it later. We don't ask for separate bills in crowded and busy places like this one. Hope this helps!", "author": "Luis C."}

Ok, so you're not going to be robbed or get into a fight at lunchtime, but there is still a trap-door in the floor where you can imagine old drunkards being drugged and sent off to sea for an involuntary trip to Shanghai.  Sadly I think they now use the trapdoor for transporting veggie burgers.  If only the Sidney Ducks knew what became of their stomping grounds...\n\nHonestly I have nothing unique to contribute about this place that hasn't already been written: I just wanted my name to appear next to the Grumpy moniker.  That and to profess my love for my Friday lunch haunt, which satisfies a fix for what I think is the best turkey burger in the city.  \n\nThe burger's come in a multitude of options, but almost always I go with the \"Popeye\" which features spinach and feta - I am'z what I am'z cause I eats my spinach.  The fries are perfect (but they don't travel well so dine-in).  If you don't want fries you can go the side-salad route, knowing that Grumpy's serves up a far better side-salad than you deserve to get in a bar.  Seriously, who goes to a pub for a salad?  \n\nEverything I've had at Grumpy's rates well.  Salads too.  I have a friend who is eating his way down the menu and it never ceases to surprise us how each offering is seemingly better than expected.  Grumpy's is just very good.  It is also busy and loud.  There is some outside seating but I'm always cold so that's not the best option if your cold-blooded too.\n\nGo, have a pint, have some fries and try not to end up on a ship out to sea.  Although I hear Shanghai is lovely this time of year.\n\nCheck out the menu at: http://grumpys.citysearch.com/", "author": "Aaron M."}

The burger was cooked to order, medium rare and the brie was a great combination.  The fries were perfectly crispy, great when hot but still good when it cooled down.  My fried chicken - there were 3 pieces - one each of the wing, thigh and breast.  It was very crispy but pretty tasty.  I only had the wing and thigh since I'm not a white meat person.  Hubby had it and said it was a bit dry.

For the old timers, they'll remember it as McGovern's.\n\nThis place is a classic and since I've been going there, the place has seen the rise of the TV stations grow around it (KPIX, KGO & KNTV), to the sprouting of numerous radio stations and of course the arrival and demise of various ad agencies around it.  Then it's seen the ol' 480 freeway demolished after the quake of '89 and following that the dot com boom and the ensuing bust and here we go again, another rally with the hi-tech industry, hence Web 2.0.  That's a brief history surrounding Grumpy's, now you're up to speed.\n\nBut what's consistent about Grumpy's (I'm not a lunch crowd type there, but a frequent after-work crowd...huge dif), is how their bartenders (several over the years) somehow always attain a true and sincere measure of grumpiness.  After they've been working there awhile, they all turn out like Jack Nicholson in the Shining, \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\"\n\nIn the end, it is a neighborhood bar that happens to be in the Barbary Coast business section at the edge of the stuffy Financial District at the foot of Telegraph Hill.  There aren't too many suits, but they're welcome anyway for a drink or so.\n\nMeanwhile, whole tribes from several neighboring companies come to unwind after work, wax poetic about their day's toils and even mingle with members of the other tribes.  It is a friendly bar, not because of the bartenders, but because of the patrons.\n\nSo if you come, brace yourself for an unfriendly service, but be entertained by the shenanigans of the natives...most likely to be seen after 5 pm.\n\nUpdate as of December 2008.  They have a cool new bartender, Sean.  So, Sean, we're waiting for the day your turn ahem, Grumpy.", "author": "Arvey S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-03-06", "description": "Let me describe my experience...its long...but its valuable and embelished only where necessary....\n\nTwo co-workers and I walked down to Grumpy's over a Friday lunch break to grab a burger and a beer.  We had heard that their burgers were awesome, and wanted to give it a shot since it was in walking distance from our office.  We assumed we could get in & out of there in an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, but man were we wrong!  We were seated and given abundant time to review the menu before our waiter finally came over to take our orders.  I ordered a western burger, while my two buddies ordered the same burger...only one with no mayo and fries....the other as-is with potato salad.  We also got a beer-a-piece.  About 30 minutes and a pint later, it dawns on us that 1) our food has not arrived, and 2) the two tables that were seated 10 minutes after us were at least 8 bites into their lunches.  After one friend mutters the token, \"What...are they killin' the cow back there?\" the bus boy comes by to ask us if we need a refresher on our brewskies.  We collectively agreed, \"We've got no food to cram in our mouths, so bring us another round, bus boy!\"  (side note: our waiter was not seen for these 30 minutes)  Just as the bus boy brings us our 2 beers (side note: we ordered 3!!), we noticed our waiter crawled out of the black hole he fell in and was bringing out our food.  (side note: 40 minutes had passed from the time we ordered)  The orders were screwed up...everything had mayo on it and one guy got the other's potato salad...it was a mess.  Once the mayo mistake was brought to the attention of the our re-established waiter, he opted to go back to the kitchen and bring out a plain bun to my buddy and had him take care of it himself.  Nice work.\n\nAfter all of this, we were pretty torqued, but were happy with the results of the burgers.  They were tasty.  (side note: 1 hr. and 15 min. had passed from ordering to finishing the food)  Since our waiter was paying no attention to us, we had to flag him down like a airport runway worker just to get our check.  Then...surprise!! ...he brought us the wrong bill.  For 3 guys consuming 3 burgers and 5 beers, he was charging us $115.  Our calm, happy-go-Friday demeanors were slipping to the dark side.  I called to him from two tables away saying, \"This is not our check.\"  He went back, brought us a check for around $50-something and said, \"Thanks for coming in today guys!!\"  Our pleasure.\n\nWe promptly paid with cash, and left him a $5 tip.  (side note: we are not cheap restaurant guests, we just tip appropriately)  We begin walking down the sidewalk, back to our office after an hour and  1/2 lunch when we hear, \"Hey guys!! Was something wrong??\"  Our waiter, rigid and red-faced was chasing us down the sidewalk in search of an explanation.  Without missing a beat, we listed off all of the 7 or 8 GLARING errors that were made.  Waiter says, \"Well, OK, I just wanted to know because I've been having problems with the kitchen all day.\"  Other niceties were exchanged and I ended by saying, \"But my burger was good.\"  \n\nWhen I was a waiter, I would blame stuff on the kitchen too in order to save a tip, but this was b.s. because the dude was not even around for 90% of our lunch.  There is no way it was the kitchen's fault.  The bus boy gave us better service than he did, and he even screwed up by bringing two beers for three people.\n\nHorrible, horrible experience.

I came in on a friday just after noon and was immediately able to sit down.  Service was really quick and the servers were very friendly.   I got the French Burger with a side of garlic fries.  $10.50 seems a lot for a burger but I was surprised on how big this burger was.  I will definietly be making two meals out of it.  When I got the bill, there was a $1.50 difference between the check and the subtotal so I asked the waiter and he explained that the Garlic Fries are extra so be forewarned when the waiter is going through the available sides for the burgers that Garlic Fries and Onion Rings are an additional charge.  I would recommend adding that line underneath the available sides so they don't get anyone upset in the future over hidden charges.  But overall, it was a great meal.  If the prices were a little cheaper I would have given it 5 stars but hey, this is San Francisco, and the place seems to be pretty popular.

Not to mention the delicious mouth watering fries that accompany the wonderful burger. It is heaven on a plate. In fact, the whole menu is freaking awesome. If you crave a simple grilled cheese with fries like I do, Grumpys! If you crave Fried Chicken & Mash Potatoes, Grumpys! If you crave chicken wings or a nice green salad, Grumpys! Overall, best pub food by far. Oh and you can get shit faced there too.", "author": "Petey L."}
