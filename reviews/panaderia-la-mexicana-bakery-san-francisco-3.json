I think back to all the times my grandma would promise that if I came with her to buy verduras and behaved that we would go get pan at La Mexicana. My favorites are the gusano's (worm) they're a sugar coated bread that look kind of like a worm. They're filled with that delicious soft bread goodness! I also think they have good Conchas and butter cookies with raspberry on top. Grab a tray and tongs and load up! \n\nBtw-I'm pretty sure they're cash only. Get there early for the warmest freshest bread, although I believe the bakers bake throughout the morning. Avoid Sunday's as they don't bake that day, so it's slim pickins", "author": "Athena L."}

I selected three items to try - the concha, the coconut jam roll and a puff pastry topped with chocolate and coconut flakes.  I liked that all were quite fresh and not too sweet.  However, they I found all them them to be a bit bland with no pronounced flavors of cinnamon, vanilla or even butter.  Perhaps I picked the wrong items or perhaps I picked items with similar taste profiles.  Of the three, I liked the concha the most.\n\nThe bakery was nearly empty during my visit on a weekday just before noon.  Trays and tongs are stacked by the register.  None of the products are labeled or have prices listed.  \n\nWhen I presented my items for payment, I was quoted $3.  When I asked if that was for each or for all three items the cashier then told me the total was $5.  Cash only.\n\nParking on 24th was plentiful when I walked in but less available when I left, with more spots open on the side streets.", "author": "Melissa L."}

(This review is written from the lens of someone who eats Chinese Bakery buns almost everyday).\n\nWalking in, it reminded me of the Chinese bakeries that I visit often. When you walk in, you pick up a tray and tongs to clip your buns. There are no prices list out in the open, nor are there signs to label the buns to describe what kinds of buns they are, but that's part of the surprise of buying the buns!\n\nI went straight for the turtle shaped panaderia bun! (We grabbed two of these) The bun itself was shaped like a turtle, it was a little softer than the buns you have at a Western supermarket, but it was slightly tougher than the traditional Chinese buns. The bottom part of the bun is a little harder too! This bun reminded me of the pineapple bun, but the top portion is thicker, no honey and a little more like a soft cookie compared to the pineapple bun - pretty delicious!!\n\nMy friend got the cinnamon bun looking item. We were both not a big fan of grabbing this item as it tasted like rum and it was a little more moist than a cake. \n\nIn addition, we tried two of the sweet buns with sugar on it and one of the cookies. All together, the cost of 6 items was roughly $8.50, not bad!!! If I lived in this area, I would probably come here often for their buns!", "author": "Kristy N."}

I have only been once and stumbled upon it when I had a ten-minute wait between bus transfers and my fat ass wanted some baked goods at 9:30 AM. From the bus stop, the store sign was in sight. I checked my phone to see how much time I had and made the right decision by hustlin' into this bakery.\n\nUpon arrival, I was in awe at the shelves of bread. I'm not familiar with Mexican baked goods so I have no idea what most of them are. For n00bs like me, little labels would be great. Without knowing prices, my $5 bill got me at least two items -- the vanilla custard/pudding empanada and the turtle bread. Why? Well, I saw another customer buy the empanada and I chose the turtle bread because it looked cute.\n\nThe verdict: Vanilla pudding empanada was damn tasty. Soft, thick outside and not-too-sweet, jiggly filling. Winner! Turtle bread was essentially a giant dinner roll with the Chinese pineapple bun topping. It tasted good but kinda dry.\n\nCash only!", "author": "Liana F."}

It feels wrong to show up empty handed, so I walked into this shop, captivated by the smell and racks upon racks of pastries.  One of the pastries that I grabbed was this bread pudding-like thing (I know, very eloquently described).  \n\nThere's no better way to describe what it was like to bite into it except to say that this was one of three SF pastries that caused me to have a come-to-Jesus moment.\n\nCue to this past weekend when I really wanted a friend to experience this come-to-Jesus moment.  I drove all the way to the Mission, parked my car and put money in the meter just to come to this place.  Walked in.  There was no bread pudding.\n\n\"Excuse me, do you have any bread pudding?\"\n\"No, we just sold out\" (oh hell no)\n\"B-b-b-but -- it's my favorite thing here!  I drove all the way out here just for it!  I wanted to bring it to a picnic!\"\n\"Okay, hold on... (he goes to the back and comes out with a piece of bread pudding)  Is this what you wanted?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"This is the last piece and I had just removed it from the display case.  Do you still want it?\"\n\"Uh, yeah, I still want it.\" \n\"Tell you what -- I'll give this to you for free so you can take it to your picnic. (hands bag to me)  Enjoy.\"\n\nI tried to buy some other pastries, but he told me it was alright, implying that I didn't have to buy anything just because he gave me a piece of bread pudding, but I insisted I needed to bring more to the picnic.\n\nAs if having that bread pudding wasn't enough to make my day, that experience here put a smile on my face for the rest of the day.\n\nThe pastries may or may not have arrived to the picnic with a chunk missing from every piece :)", "author": "Debbie L."}

Driving up at 7 AM I had no trouble parking.  The storefront is adorable, the main entrance is flanked by two window cases neatly filled with pastries.  The interior is well maintained and clean.  I loved the vintage look of the black/white linoleum floor.  \n\nI have been to panaderia or two in the past so I knew the routine --  pick up tongs and tray and serve yourself from the well stocked bakery cases.  My husband was a bit lost with this process so I advised him to just watch the other customers.  We watched and copied a couple who selected warm, just out of the oven, pastries from a baking rack located towards the back of the bakery.  We also selected some from the glass cases.  We filled our tray in no time.  Even though we were clueless about the names of most items, we enjoyed our little morning adventure selecting ones that just looked tasty.  The wonderful smell of fresh baked goods helped us too.  We brought our tray to the cheerful young lady behind the counter and she carefully bagged our 8 or 10 items.  Total price for our large bag of yummy pan dulce ---  $11.40.  Not bad at all.   We'll definitely be back.\n\nOnce we were back in the car we divided our treats.  My husband made a grab for any pastry with crystal sugar, there was a pretzel shaped one, a bowtie, and a cream horn.  My favorite was a turtle looking pastry with raisin eyes.

Having heard wonderful things of the bacon-laden option I finished my interview at 4:00, bid my farewells, and changed back into my jogging shoes. Rushing through the streets of The Mission past any number of unique Hispanic, Korean, and Chinese options I finally saw the sign for Dynamo - and the metal awning closing before my very eyes. Stopping the clerk I was informed that they'd been sold out of donuts since \"about 2:00\" and that he'd merely been selling coffee. He invited me to come back the next morning, but alas my schedule didn't allow for such - there is always next time.\n\nAs I was walking away I was somewhat disappointed but plenty excited to proceed to my next stop (Humphry Slocombe) until I was stopped by a well-dressed couple who stated \"Don't worry, their donuts aren't that good - if you want to try something awesome there is this little Mexican pastry shop up the street called Panaderia - go there and get whatever the clerk recommends as fresh baked.\" Having already passed a Mexican Bakery and being admittedly impressed by the display I figured \"Why not?\" and continued along until I found the small shop exactly where they said it would be.\n\nWalking in the door I was instantly struck by the wonderful smell of apples and cinnamon - and the fact that I couldn't read a single word on the wall, menu, or pastry cases! Taking the advice of the couple I asked the clerk \"What's good?\" only to get the response \"What you like?\" Stating I wasn't sure didn't seem to get me anywhere as I once again received \"What you like?\" as a response. Not wanting to drag this on for too long I responded \"Something fresh, with fruit\" and the man smiled and led me to the case where he stated \"Get this, and this.\" Asking what they were (and having it written down so I could remember) I was told a Mexican Wedding Cookie with Guava and an Empanada de Calabaza (pumpkin.) $2.20 cents later I emerged with my prizes and dug in.\n\nFirst opting for the Empanada I must admit I was somewhat skeptical due to its plain appearance - a skepticism that resolved the moment I bit through the flaky crust and tasted the burst of pumpkin-pie-esque flavor. With hints of cinnamon and vanilla the dainty pastry worked excellently and was almost like a hostess fruit pie yet far more tasty. Not too sweet, not too heavy - I probably could've eaten 2-3 if I weren't planning on ice cream and a subsequent dinner.\n\nMy second choice, the Mexican Wedding Cookie, was another wonderful surprise and reminded me of a better version of the Russian Tea Balls my aunt makes each year at Christmas - but with chunks of almond and walnut plus a wonderfully tart compote that tasted of strawberry and cherry at once. Eating as carefully as I could I still managed to end up with about a teaspoon of powdered sugar on my black suit (a fact noted by myself and chuckled at by the cashier at Humphry Slocombe - who additionally noted her love for Panaderia when I attempted to explain myself) but it was absolutely worth it - and the dry cleaning bill!", "author": "Michael U."}

I went there on a Sunday morning after a long night of drinking and smoking buds. The funny thing is that I was at Pop's dive bar (next door) couple of hours ago. After Pop's, I went to my buddies' flat house 2 blocks away from this bakery to party more. At the end when everybody is passing out or went home, and my friends Raccoon & Ed wanted to get pizza at 4am. \n\nRaccoon asked, \"Hey do you want to chip in for a pizza?\"\n\nI said, \"Man, pizza suck, that shit is overrated sober food. Everytime is pizza this, pizza that even a old cold pizza from a shitty ass parlor. I'm tired of eating that crap. What are we? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? I'll wait until the bakery is open or a taquer\u00eda is open that serve menudo or breakfast burrito. Something different to get the munchies\".\n\nRaccoon said, \"You're gay\"\n\nI said, \"Pizza is gay just like you\"\n\nSo the guys ended up passing out and I'm the only one who is a awake. I left the house and walked to the bakery. The bright fluorescent light in the window of the bakery was so bright that my eyes were suddenly awaken. The smell of fresh pastries woke me up, and I was also excited to munch. There are some pastries that are shape of alligators and turtles. The cookie melted in my mouth after I took a bite.

I've never had baked goods from a Mexican bakery before and wasn't sure what to expect.  Lets just say, now I've been here four times and I've only discovered this place a week ago!  There aren't any labels on anything so, I normally just grab anything that looks appealing - since yelpers say everything is good.  And the yelpers are absolutely right, everything is yummy here! From, their pastries, to their breads, cookies and muffins, everything is delish!  \n\nJust a warning though, it's easy to go crazy here - can be dangerous for those watching their waistline.  They give you a huge plate and tongs and you can just pile it on!  I have yet to come out of this bakery without a bag full of goodies.  Goodies range from about 75cents to $1.75.  This place is great to grab an inexpensive treat :)", "author": "Veronica N."}

There is more to the city than what's mentioned in the paper/tv or what's considered \"hip\".  Do not be afraid if you don't know what anything is!  Just ask!\n\nFrom the outside, this place looks like nothing special.  From the inside, it still looks like nothing special.  Linoleum flooring.  Fluorescent lighting.  But then you peer in the large cases with shelves of unfamiliar pastries and then your head starts spinning and your mouth starts watering.\n\nThe Mexican pastries here are light and sweet, but not too sugary (like Danishes can often be).  All kinds of options from plain (unadorned) dough pastries to those stuffed with lemon custard, fruit, etc.  I like how the pastry is the perfect balance between baked and moist.  Most of the time they are overdone and very dry.  I didn't even need tea to go with mine.\n\nYes, nothing is labeled.  Just look and guess, or ask if you really want to know.  Pick up a tray, some paper, tongs, and go to town.  I don't know what I get.  But it's all good so far!  Each pastry is a little over $1 and when you get home and put it on a plate you may think it's a lot to have as a small snack and wonder if somehow it grew on the way home.\n\nBike Parking: Designated bike racks around the corner on York St.", "author": "Jean K."}

You enter, pick up a tray and tongs, and help yourself.  The panaderia is very clean and appears to be well kept.  There's not much customer service here since you serve yourself but for those that are nitpicky - no one greeted me as I entered and no one asked if I needed help or had any questions despite taking my time deciding what to get.  \n\nI ultimately settled on a slice of pound cake and a Salvadorian quesadilla, and thank goodness that was all I took because I was quite surprised at the price of $2.50!  Perhaps I am cheap, but I'd like to think I just know what fair prices are for pan dulce.  I actually regret not walking away when I heard the price because I didn't think either piece of pan dulce was anything more than average.  I was expecting to pay between $1.50 to $1.75 but not $2.50! \n\nI'm sure someone reading this is thinking how could I give this panaderia 2 stars after only having tried 2 pieces of their pan dulce?  Well - here is how: as a business you have only one opportunity to make a first impression and you should never count on two.  Bake every piece of pan dulce to the best of your ability and offer fair prices.  It's absurd to think a customer will continue to sample your offerings if their initial impression is average and overpriced...especially when you're in a market as saturated as yours is with competition.\n\nPanaderia La Mexicana earns 2 stars for only average pan dulce and extremely high prices.  This panaderia is not worth visiting in my opinion.", "author": "B\u00e1nh B."}

We're from Texas so we don't know what it's called - our panaderias don't have them - but my god they are delicious. The cakes taste a little lemony, and while incredibly sweet, it was also incredibly delicious.\n\nGreat bargain too - under $10 for pan dulces and sweets for six people.", "author": "Sari C."}

The whole tray and tongs situation was refreshingly the same and I had a ball poking around the shelves and seeing alll the pan dulce, cakes and empanadas that Panaderia had to offer. I ended up with a good old sugar twist bread and a concha. Both yummy and for 1.85, a very substantial dessert/snack.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Glad they are so close to my house.  \n\nBTW the other stuff is good here too.  Coffee's fine and the fact they are open soooooo early is wonderful.", "author": "Aron T."}

Everything always tastes like flour. This is probably the 2nd best one on 24th street, only second to the one between mission and valencia.", "author": "Mark A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-06", "description": "After trying the pastries from different Mexican bakeries in the Mission, this place is my overall favorite to go to for pan dulce.  As you step through the door of the bakery, your senses will be stimulated by the aroma of the fresh baked goods and the large assortment of visually appetizing pan dulce.  Their round, fat conchas are the perfect balance of density and sweet softness.  And then there are the horn-shaped cuernitos, croissant shaped pastries that are cakey and sweet.  And the custard filled pastries are fantastic.  With their wide selection of different pastries, you can try something new on each visit.  I recommend stopping at this bakery, grabbing a pair of tongs and a tray, and loading up on the pastries!", "author": "michele g."}

This place is exactly like walking into a panaderia in mexico, not least because it's a total hole in the wall.  Just an empty room with a counter and some self-serve cases with all the various goodies.  If only they could get a tumbleweed to blow by the front door.  You pretty much can't go wrong here, but try getting some pan dulce if you can't decide.", "author": "Wes M."}

The thing I've always loved about panaderias is this, even if it doesn't taste that great, the pastries are always going to look like the pastries in my dream world. Although La Mexicana actually has less of the colorful and decadent looking masterpieces of other panaderias in the area, the taste leaves me with nothing to complain about. Jellied coconuted sugar bread in my tummy for a buck. Done.", "author": "Hallie R."}

This place has not changed much, and the bread continues to be great.  Compared to other Mexican bakeries, this bread is the sweetest.  The gusano, a pastry with a custard like bread filling, is probably my favorite at this location, next to the jelly roll with sprinkled with coconut.", "author": "Christina and Jaime F."}

We have been going to this bakery since the late 1970s and I am required to bring pig cookies to North Carolina when I visit my sister. I usually stick to the pig cookies, but have recently branched out and tried a roll that tasted just like fresh challah. We polished off all of our goodies in about 5 minutes.", "author": "Jody S."}

(Get well soon!)  Enter Panaderia La Mexicana, a place that my grandmother introduced me years ago.  Don't let the surroundings on 24th St. scare you.  Just get there early, and enjoy any of the dulces in the morning.  I just got back from the bakery (or panaderia), and got some of their delicious apple turnovers, an egg-nog flavored pastry, and some cinnamon rolls.  And the sweet stuff is delightful.  Just in time to have some coffee and some World Cup action.  (Go Germany!)  I told the sweet old lady who individually wrapped each one of my baked goods to bet the farm on Germany.  (As of this writing, Deustchland is ahead of Peron Country) The lines can be long there so get them early.  Great bakery, delightful people, and treats that are sweet.  We shall return.", "author": "Tony L."}

I was born in the Mission in 1963 and left the city , not by choice in 1979.  I have been in the contra costa area since then, and I only return to the city to visit family and giants and niner games.  I always stop by the panderia to pick some goodies and on a whime will drive over to pick up some up with my girlfriend.  She is hooked.", "author": "David A."}
