We ordered 1 large veggie platter, 1 mixed kabob platter, and 1 medium salad and it was more than enough food for the group. They were ready on time and it was perfect temperature. \n\nI grew up with this food, and I really was impressed. Their falafels were on point, were not dry at all (which can commonly happen)...they were incredible! The amount of veggie/meat options were perfect for our group, and we're big eaters.", "author": "Michelle N."}

Ok, but what part of my repping didn't you see? Christ my call letters pretty much jump out at you. Then I feel obliged to drop a tip because I don't wanna come out of this hellhole with food poisoning because the food isn't FRESH.\n\nAgain, cold falafel, the hummus was ok, baba gounoosh not fresh, ditto the tabuli salad.

I have lived not too far from this restaurant and I can't believe I have not gone sooner. The food there was good and the portions are very generous. \n\nSome dishes that you should consider trying: \n+Baba ganoush \n+Lentil rice (side) \n+Hummus \n+Lamb kabob \n\nThe lamb was not overcooked and they gave us a good amount of meat. The side of rice that came with the lamb kabob place was also really good and very fragrant. You are able to choose two sides with your entree plate, which I appreciated. They had a wide variety of sides to choose from. Their fries were decent (but they gave you a lot of fries if you order this as a choice of side). They also had a very tasty Mediterranean salad, which I really enjoyed.

From their friendly service to the delicious food, I'm delighted to give this place an awesome review. I came around 3:30pm with my coworkers and one of my coworkers came early to order & pay for our meal! She's the sweetest! Love you, Maria! \n\nBecause of her, it came out when we got there so it was nice & fresh. I ordered the chicken kebab dinner plate which included rice and two sides! Just $13.95, this plate can serve as two meals. I had plenty to take home to the boyfriend. For my sides, I got two falafels & hummus which came with warm pita bread. Everything tasted delicious. My coworkers ordered the lamb which they both enjoyed. I stole some of their cucumber tabbouleh which was delicious!!!! I couldn't get enough.\n\nI would definitely come back again if I come back to work at UCSF. Sadly, I will be quitting to start school but I'll still be in the area so I may pop in for a wrap or two. There's plenty of seating areas at least at the time we went (between lunch and dinner). And best of all, I love how it's just a skip and a hop down Parnassus from the UCSF Med Center where I work. It's also very accessible by public transportation via the N or the bus (43 or 6). Any way you get here, you'll find it was worth the journey.", "author": "Brittany D."}

Typically the older family members at the register are friendly and pleasant. Tonight the younger dark haired/dark skinned male family member was an absolute dick.

I therefore didn't have any confidence that he actually knew the prices and therefore was making them up on the spot. He didn't appreciate that I questioned him and kicked me out without letting me buy the items I wanted. You've permanently lost my business and will always order from Amazon and Whole Foods.

It was okay.. the meat seemed a bit dry ... maybe it wasn't fresh because its the end of the weekend?  I tried my friend's hummus and babganoush- good, but wasn't the best I ever had. They did grill the tomatoes and onions when I added them to add that. \n\nOverall, I think I will go there again just for good measure so I can see what the food is like during working hours and has just been made.

I have a feeling that it is family operated and they do take good care of their place. Perhaps a bit random to mention but their bathroom is so clean and nice that I almost rather use their bathroom than my own... Sorry, perhaps not something you want to read in a food review but just to give you an idea of how clean this place seems to be.\n\nSo, like I said, the food is great and so are the prices. I usually end up having the lamb shawirma (the chicken is really good to) and if you are very hungry, or just a normal guy, you might want to consider to upgrade your shawirma and get two side orders, such as hummus and tabouley, with some pita bread to go with it. If you are a vegetarian, do try their falafel, it is really good!\n\nThey do have outdoor seating but since it faces north you will not find sun here during the day.", "author": "Jonas B."}

They put pickles in the shawerma, so if you're not into that, beware. The fries get points for most likely being home-made actual potatoes, but the thick cut could use 2 trips to the fryer or perhaps skip them altogether and try a different starter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-03-11", "description": "Update - 2/2011:\n\nNote to Taboun's management: if I find a piece of a blue, cut rubber band in my baba ghanoush, and I bring it to your attention, the response I'm expecting is (1) an apology and (2) a full refund.  Telling me that I'd already eaten it doesn't make up for the fact that you may have poisoned me.  Never again.\n\n\n*******************************\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd give Taboun 3.5 stars.  But life's not perfect and Yelp doesn't give me the option of 3.5 stars.  So I'm giving Taboun 3 stars today, with the hopes that my next meal at Taboun won't be as disappointing as my last. \n\nIn Taboun's defense, I have always ordered the vegetarian combo plate and have been mostly happy with it: large portions of (usually) fresh cucumber salad, along with hummus & baba ghanoush & plenty of pita bread -- (mostly) good food, and enough to share.\n\nSo that made my most recent meal at Taboun that much more disappointing.  I decided to be adventurous and try something different: the falafel deluxe wrap, \"plated.\"  I understood my order to mean (1) deluxe = some of that yummy grilled eggplant sitting on the counter along with \"potatoes,\" and (2) 2 yummy side dishes and some pita bread.  I was sorely disappointed.  Although the falafel itself was fine, it was pretty cold, temperature-wise.  My kid loved it, though, and it was coated in tahini, so I figured that was fine.  But there were way too many raw onions inside the wrap.  Also, there was maybe just a piece or two of that tasty-looking eggplant and instead of \"potatoes,\" there were two mediocre french fries in my wrap.  I'm sorry, but if your menu HAS \"good ol' fashioned [french] fries\" on it, why would you say that you're adding \"potatoes\" when, in fact, you're really just adding two soggy french fries?  Seems like false advertising to me.  Besides, my two yummy side dishes turned out to be weak in comparison with the veggie plate: if I order a side of french fries, could you spare more than, say, six or eight?  That seemed kind of cheap.  The two dolmas were tasty, but the single piece of dry pita bread, cut into quarters, was missing something -- say, tahini?  And while you're at it, could you at least offer me some ketchup for my six or eight fries?\n\nI'll probably go back to Taboun, if only because (1) this place is in our neighborhood and is near my kid's favorite park, (2) for $18, my spouse, toddler and I were full after our shared meal, and (3) the food is fast -- which is ideal for a family on the go.  But when we do go back to Taboun, I will never stray from the veggie plate again!  For better food, you'll pay more (an arm and a leg, perhaps) at La Mediterranee, but you won't ever be disappointed.", "author": "Susan L."}

So pleasantly surprised because it was not greasy, the chicken was actually moist, not dried out and extremely delcious.  My friend had beef and lamb shish kebab but as a wrap and it was huge.  It was actually two wraps.  She couldn't eat the whole thing in one sitting.  So, lunch and dinner for her, for the price of one meal.  Pretty cool.

I tried out Taboun on short notice earlier this week, as I was buying for a small group of people, for an informal gathering (and it's just around the corner from my apartment).  Rather than go the standard route of getting a wrap (a felafel or something else), I instead went with some sides; all very reasonably-priced, and very good-sized portions: A dozen felafels, a Mojadara (Lentils & Rice, cooked with onions) and Hummus.  I must say I was quite pleased with the quality.  The felafels were huge & tasty (they're quite often dry & flavorless from many Middle-Eastern restaurants), the Mojadara was lovely & filling (and again, a large portion), and the Hummus was EXCELLENT (much better than you would buy in your local grocery store.  It's funny, hummus - it's such a simple thing, but so easy to screw up!  It can easily be considered the measure of a Middle-Eastern restaurant - how well they do Hummus, as the care they put into this very simple dish will often indicate the level of quality you'll get from other dishes.  The Hummus at Taboun is great - wonderful balance of flavors: not too lemony, not too garlicky, with just the right amount of olive oil).  OK, so I didn't try too many items.  But the ones I DID try were all excellent, and I will take them as indicators for the quality of the rest of the menu.  I will definitely go back (in fact, I've been thinking about it all week, but haven't had the opportunity).  If you like Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean food (and live in the Cole Valley area), then Taboun is certainly worth a shot.", "author": "Eric H."}
