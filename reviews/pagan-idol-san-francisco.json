I was giddy with excitement as we walked into pagan idol this particular Thursday evening. Our group walked off the streets of SF and straight into a wooden ship. We passed by a pretty aquarium and intimate 2 top tables and up a few stairs to the back room. \n\nWe were able to grab a few drink menus to ponder are pagan libations. I decided on the banana life because it sounded utterly delicious. Rum, banana liquor, grapefruit, lime and fassionola. \"What is that, anyway?\" I asked the Hawaiian shirt clad sir behind the bar. It's a syrup that is made up of tropical fruits and is a staple in great tiki drinks. Sounds good, good sir. Serve it up! I watched as he created the masterpiece and garnished it with a banana leaf and plantain chips. It. Was. Everything! Not too much of any one particular flavor, and while I was a little nervous it might be super sweet it was a nice, refreshing drink that didn't make me overthink the sugar content. But let's be honest, at a tiki bar no one is counting calories!\n\nOne bit of warning for my friends who are hanging out in the back room: cling tightly to your drinks. There will be a loud burst of sound and fog to resemble that of a volcano erupting. I almost lost my drink as I was not expecting it! But once my heart returned to normal rhythm I could fully appreciate the effort and beauty of the dramatics.", "author": "Sarah S."}

It's broken up into two rooms, the back definitely being the wackier of the two with aquariums, smoke machines and volcanos. The front room is a little cozier with plenty of seating. They have a huge menu with some pretty yummy looking drinks but I was afraid of waking up with a sugar induced headache. I asked the waiter what he recommended and opted for the classic daiquiri. It was definitely the least fun looking out of my groups, coming in a classy glass as opposed to a fish bowl, but I absolutely loved it. \n\nI was here with a group of about 7 and there was plenty of room to sit or stand.

Holy smokes, so delicious. Tiki drinks usually look good, but these drinks blew me out of the water. Pagan Love, enjoyed first, was rum, lime, orange, guava, papaya, and funk bass lines. That's right, delicious they were, those funk bass lines. The sweetness and citrus was balanced perfectly. As far as the Pagan Potion goes, it has me at Chartreuse. It was herbal and coconut-y... Freaking delicious. \n\nI never figured out the rhyme or reason, but every so often a really loud fog blasted out from the ceiling. I get fog...tiki bars... What I didn't get was that it was so loud when it turned on it could make everyone at the bar spill their drinks from being startled. It was hilarious, but might make more work for them in the end.

I get excited about making human connections so I go to wherever my friends wanted to go and this is where they wanted to come. We had a couple of rounds of name sake drinks with pretty flowers and little umbrellas. Then another friend showed up and he ordered the same drink as mine. \n\nThe crowd is your usual financial district peeps, mostly young, mostly are discussing about their careers or flirting with one another.

He was having an okay time, but I didn't want the night to end on a *cough*boring*cough* note, so I hit up the Yelpiverse for some nearby suggestions.\n\nWhaddayaknow, Pagan Idol popped up in the first few search results, and we were out of that lame, I mean, normal bar within five minutes. \n\nTiki bars can be hit or miss. There's only one tiki bar in San Jose that I'm aware of, and without naming it here, I will simply write that it is wholly mediocre. The drinks there are just uninspired and weak. This is not the case at Pagan Idol.\n\nWhile trying to avoid sounding cheesy or cliche, I have to be honest--walking into Pagan Idol is like being teleported to another world (or how I imagine that would be). A world that looks like a pimped out tiki bar. \n\nI don't really know how to describe the bar interior, as writing that it looks like a tiki bar is too vague and doesn't do this place justice. Just look at the pictures and know it's dark and oddly romantic.\n\nI dig it when bartenders love their job, and I dig it when bars offer special drinks that are tasty, and preferably are affordable. Pagan Idol satisfies most of these...and luckily, the drinks aren't too expensive. \n\nMy date was so impressed with this place, he wanted to try one of their wild $30-$40 \"group\" drinks with me, so we got the Rum Monkey. It's a tropical-tasting concoction, in whatever way you consider \"tropical\" to taste. I liked the banana flavor, in particular. The Rum Monkey can serve two regular drinkers, three light drinkers, or one heavy drinker (me). \n\nWhenever I see my Yelp friends or the foodie instagrammers I follow checking out Pagan Idol, I feel a tinge of happiness for their discovery of such a San Francisco gem.\n\nThere are a lot of bars to check out in SF, so one such as this might be easy to overlook.

So now, having experienced them both on the same night, I didn't think either one was better, I think they are different experiences. Pagan Idol seems to attract a much younger demographic than the Tonga Room and has a hipster vibe. Pagan Idol has semi private tiki huts that you can reserve and they have fresh flowers floating in the tiki drinks. The Tonga Room has food, Pagan Idol does not. Pagan Idol has some sort of eruption with lights and smoke that you have to be near to see. The Tonga Room has thunder, lightning, rain, and the bar and restaurant wrap around a huge pool of water. You can see all of that from most anywhere in the establishment. The Pagan Idol does not appear to have servers; we had to go wait at the bar to order cocktails and we were provided table service at the Tonga Room. I must admit after all of the hype about Pagan Idol I was disappointed, but keep in mind I am not a member of Pagan Idol's targeted young demographic.

The bartenders know what they're doing - the birthday girl had a whiskey sour with egg whites - I got a taste and it was damn good.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique bar in fidi- this ones fun.

Decorations are great and it feels like you're on vacation in here if you get a nice seat. The bar tenders are fun and their drinks have great presentations. A lot of the drinks have special mugs that you can take home with you but it'll cost you. Also a lot of other tables got their main drink, and they do this little show for you when you get it, but it can be quite distracting and loud to people who are trying to have conversations in other parts of the bar.\n\nHowever, their drinks are pretty good. You can taste the alcohol, but at the same time, they're sweet enough that you could drink that drink the whole night. Got the rum chi chi and I loved it. They could try to use better straws or at least you'll have to drink your drink really fast. My straw started dying on me after about 20 minutes. Would definitely come back.", "author": "Tatiana T."}

I remember watching an episode of The Layover where Anthony Bourdain (rest his soul) was in The Tonga Room and thought this is a really cool bar. I don't know much about the tiki bar scene here in the city though. \n\nEnter Pagan Idol where the corridor is like being inside a ship with port holes that allow you to see the ocean life. That is a real aquarium with fish and wooden tiki men floating inside in case you're wondering. There is a regularly scheduled tropical thunderstorm and rainfall inside. You too can experience it without having to pack your bags and fly. \n\nI'm not sure what frozen concoction I drank but it definitely included rum in a beautifully decorated cup, an umbrella, and an orchid. It definitely passes my litmus test of what a tiki bar should feel like.", "author": "Tim G."}

The space is large, separated into three different areas. Upon entering you feel as if you walked onto a pirate ship. The high wooden ceilings are curved, and adorned with blown glass octopus sconces. Set into the walls are animated portholes displaying ocean scenes, and a large fish tank holds beautiful tropical fish and even a puffer fish! Decor is eclectic, ranging from a vintage ships wheel to a stained glass peacock. In the room beyond is a second bar, with a more traditional tiki vibe-glass floats, carved wooden statues, and colorful lighting. Further inside is a spacious room suited to larger parties, with tiki huts and a volcano feature.\n\nThe bartenders here are talented industry professionals, well versed in crafting classic tiki cocktails. The menu includes around 15 beverage options ranging from well known standards like the Mai Tai to fun twists and multi-person bowl drinks. I got the Sparkle and Froth ($19), which is one of the best tiki cocktails I have ever had. Exquisitely balanced layers of pineapple, lime, and spices, packed with a powerful punch of three different varieties of rum. The price initially seemed high, but this is a VERY strong drink (limit of 2 per guest!). My boyfriend got the Rum Chi Chi ($13), which was also delicious, and served in a cute coconut mug. Coconut, spices, and dark rum are blended into a frothy sweet treat that tasted like ice cream. I highly recommend Pagan Idol and will definitely return in the future.", "author": "Alyssa F."}

My only peeve is that it doesn't have any music (the first time I went there was some kind of tribal drum beat in the background but I wouldn't count that as music). I wish they played some light music. But I suppose it doesn't exactly go with the theme and its not really a music/dance kind of place.

I have made it a personal mission of mine to get to know \"The City\" a bit better. So in getting to know SF better I have decided that I have to visit a new restaurant or social setting each and every time I set foot off the \"Bay Area Rapid Transit\" I been seeing a lot of my fellow \"Yelpers\" raving about the \"Pagan Idol\" as of late and after passing by it may times along my..\"SF Shenanigans\" I figured that it was about time that I make my guest appearance..\n\nThursday August 31, 2017\nLocation: Pagan Idol, San Francisco Ca\nPeople: 1 Adult\n\nStory: \n\"The Pagan Idol\" had been on my \"Yelpdar\" for some time now. I have a think about themed bars now. I seemed to have been to quite a few as of late and IDK if that is a coincidence or not but....I do like \"Pina Coladas and Dancing in the Rain\" so this place was from what the \"Yelpdom\" has reviewed is a good departure from my usual \"Motto\" (See Headline) so I knew that I had to drop by and see for myself. \n\nService/Hospitality:\nWell after taking a few snaps and going through them to make sure that I have the right one. I took out my ID and approached the door and was greeted by the very cool bouncer. He checked my ID and then complimented my on my overall look for the evening and then I made my way inside the bar. Of course when I went it was pretty happening inside, it was around happy hour and post work for a lot of people so I'm assuming that is why service at the bar wasn't all the way on point for me, but then again I saw people get served the same drink made better than what I received. But all that is for another part of this review, overall the service was \"Okay\" to say the least, the door guy was great, the crowd was seeming to get to some of the bartenders. But at least I finally got to get me a drink.\n\nDrink/Atmosphere:\nWell after being cut a few times and waiting about 15 min or so (To be expected) for a drink, I decided to go with a \"Pina Colada\" $13.00 to go along with spirit of the establishment. I have to say that I've had better, well at least I saw them make other peoples better than what I got (Friends Maybe) The drink was watered down, and unlike any \"Pina Colada\" that I've had. They didn't even even fill all my cup with the mixture. I honestly had a better one at \"Bamboo Hut\" on Broadway but the atmosphere is a bit better here at \"Pagan Idol\" a pretty diverse and hip crowd makes up what goes here and the very \"swanky\" decor is what seems to make up what this establishment is about. I have to say I was more impressed by the atmosphere more than my drink. \n\nOverall:\n\"Pagan Idol\" is a pretty cool place and it sits right in a busy heavily trafficked area between the Soma and North Beach Areas. I can understand why this place has the following it does, it's festive and different. This bar is more than just a bar, it's pretty unique and seems to have a pretty good following even word of mouth. Aside from this \"Meh\" experience here, I do see myself going back \"One More Time\" it's not too far off from where I like to hang out and I do feel like some of the other menu offering are intriguing. So maybe next time I will just try a Mai Thai.", "author": "Tre S."}

It left a great lasting impression! 3.5 out of 5 stars to be exact, but bumping it up to 4 because of the wonderful atmosphere!\n\nAfter attending a super fun UYE at Azucar lounge,\nA group of friends and I decided to continue the party with some Tiki love. I had never heard of this place before, but when you hang with a bunch of experienced Yelpers, you tend to discover a lot of new places along the way. Initially, we stopped by Pagan Idol first, but us foodies had to fill our bellies with some grub before we continued the night. We decided to make a pit stop for pizza before we went to the bar. When we came back to Pagan Idol we were shocked to see the long line that formed in just a matter of 20 minutes. I myself am not the most patient, and I really don't like waiting in line at places that I've never been to before. However if people are willing to wait to get into a bar, the place has to be doing something right. \n\nWe waited for a little while and finally made it into the bar. Was it worth the wait? Yes it was indeed! When you enter, you will be slapped right in the face with an abundance of Polynesian style decor! Tiki statues, a glowing fish tank, a volcano assimilation, sky high ceilings with ropes hanging from the top and a fun Cabana-like wooden structure encompass the room. At first glance, it appears that the bar is very small due to the narrowness of the room. But go ahead and trek it into the back room where there is ANOTHER bar and prepare to be impressed! This place is actually pretty spacious for a Tiki bar. \n\nWe decided to stay near the front and we were able to snag a few tables as people were leaving. The nitpicks? Well... since this place is super busy, you will have to wait a while for your drinks, so be patient. You can definitely keep yourself entertained while watching the bartenders work their magic. Another nitpick... the blended drinks here aren't really blended. They load them up with ice and then fill your glass up afterward. I love my Tiki drinks blended to a smooth consistency and I was a little disappointed to see that they don't do this here. It could have just been the drinks they we ordered,  but while I was watching the bartender, I noticed that this became a theme with many of the drinks that she made. \n\nI will say that my Jungle Bird drink tasted wonderful! Super sweet and fruity and topped with a heaping mass of whipped cream just the way I like it! A few other drinks that our group got included: Bird of Paradise, The rum monkey scorpion bowl, and the Pineapple Express. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their drinks, so there was no fuss when it came to that. As far as price points go, you should look to spend between $12-$15 for a specialty drink or $25-$50 for a scorpion bowl. Yikes! A little pricey but it's a Tiki bar in the city, so it's to be expected. \n\nPerhaps what is the most appealing element of this bar are the chill vibes and comforting atmosphere that it emits. Everyone here seemed to really be having a good time and it definitely showed.  No judgements and no frills; just a good time with good drinks and great people. So, would I come back to Pagan Idol?

It's called, \"Pagan Idol.\" This smooth-sailing theme bar brings the customers to experience the taste and refreshing flavors of incredible cocktails of the islands of Hawaii! The atmosphere is very calming and relaxing as I welcomed there. The concept is much similar to some local Tiki bars across the United States like the Jungle Bird in Sacramento. The interior designs are flawless and elegant giving it a submarine feel at the front side while at the Volcano side at the back side of the room is much roomier and edgier to space up 20+ people! Da kine!\n\nThe bartenders here are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a remarkable and tremendous service! No cons at all!\n\nNow onto the drinks! On 3/11/2017, me, Dennis T and Gabrielle A were ordering some drinks right from the menu. I picked House Daiquiri while Dennis picked the Jungle Bird and Gabrielle picked the Bird of Paradise. As a result, these cocktail drinks were phenomenal! The House Daiquiri was such a fine drink giving the best mixtures of rum, lime juice, sugar and a bought of happiness. Not bad. For the Jungle Bird and Bird of Paradise, they were also absolutely wonderful! Much flavorful and bolder to drink. A sigh of relief!\n\nParking at Pagan Idol can be a risk to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, car pool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Pagan Idol is the coolest and the most unbelievable Tiki bar that I've ever visited in years thanks to Dennis T's recommendations idea. Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering all night long! A well received visit! Mahalo! My rating: 5 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

It comes complete with the mystical rain \u00e0 la Rainforest Caf\u00e9 and fog like something out of Legends of the Hidden Temple. It's pretty dark in here, so I'd recommend ordering from the bar, where you can actually see what you're ordering. \n\nThey have a variety of fun cocktails as well as a few bowls, which is a nice addition for groups. We shared a Jamaican Scorpion Bowl and a Rum Monkey. Both were good, although the Rum Monkey was sort of icy and super frothy, so we had a mound of froth when we had finished--but it makes sense because the drink contains an egg and cream!\n\nDrinks range mostly around $12-20, which is par for the course. They do have a $10 margarita but umm who comes to a tiki bar to order a margarita?? \n\nFun place that I'd be happy to come back to!", "author": "Willie R."}

The decor is more \"tiki\" than that other SF place that masquerades as a tiki bar (cough *Smugglers Cove* cough). The real trick is figuring out when to be here when there are no FiDi d-bags taking over the joint - they're mean and surly, and that makes the bartenders mean and surly.\n\nSadly that means I frequent other Tiki bars in the Bay Area if it's not a Monday RIGHT after work when a convention is NOT in town... wait, I guess I don't frequent this place often, then...not with so many other legit Tiki options around.\n\nToo bad, really.  Those drinks are good*.\n\n*When they're mean and surly, they don't make good off-menu tiki drinks.

We arrived at Pagan Idol for our first time and we were second in line...10 minutes later....there was a line all the way in front of Starbucks! Yikes!\n\nQUICK TIP: Arrive early to avoid the long lines! (SMILES)\n\nNow...I have been hearing all about Pagan Idol and was happy when my friends chose this location to have some drinks. Once I got past the security who was checking ID's, I finally was able to walk in to the most talked about Tiki Bar in San Francisco! My first impression walking in was: \"Dang, this place is small with a remarkable Hawaii type of look\". The inside has a kitschy Polynesian theme to it! I really love it!\n\nAlthough the inside looks small I was surprised to know that there was more room in the back of the first bar. There is a sitting area at the entrance, with the coolest little wooden tables. When looking closely you will notice that each table features a wood carving of an island group! There is also a very cozy bar with a couple stools so you can sit and watch the bartenders decorate the drinks! As you explore further in the back, there's a larger, busier bar in the next area. Tropical decor and idols and mood lighting abound. Past that large bar area, there's plenty more tables and sitting areas. (This place is surprisingly huge once you really walk around. \n\nLuckily, people were leaving while my group and I was walking in so we were able to grab some stools right in front of the bartenders. \n\nI have to admit that it was a joy watching the bartenders make the drink! They really take their time in making delicious and appealing tropical drinks! Every drink that they made looked good! The menu is easy to read and list the ingredients of the drink. \n\n2ND TIP: It's best to order your drinks all at once so you don't have to keep going up to the bar area. I was able to order all 3 of my drinks at one time! I suggest you order in advance. \n\nMy top favorite drinks you ask? Well, I honestly don't think you can go wrong in ordering drinks when you are here. I am sure all of the drinks are delicious and come even come in cute glasses. I ordered the, \"Bird of Paradise\" and it was EVERYTHING! I would strongly encourage you to try this! \n\nAlthough the drinks were very tasty and surprisingly good even though you don't taste the alcohol (these drinks DO sneak up on you!) I warned you! This is a great night for tourist or people who have never been to a Tiki Bar! If you like tropical, island d\u00e9cor, and fruit and flowers in your drinks then this is the place for you! The night can be an expensive night if you are thinking about ordering more than 3 drinks. Each drink ranges from $10-15 per drink! Ouch! (My can walk out spending $100 easily on drinks)\n\nThe atmosphere is really chill! I guarantee you will have a great time. The location is perfect as well, steps away from Chinatown so once you are done drinking make sure to check out Chinatown for some good eats!", "author": "Porsche C."}

Really fantastic. The drinks also hold their own attention. Each cocktail is made with care and there is a wide menu to explore. Like most tiki bars, the drinks are not cheap.

This tiki bar is WAY bigger than I thought from the outside. Upon getting carded by the bouncer, I walked into Pagal Idol and stood there to admire all the tiki d\u00e9cor, including the little aquarium in the front of the bar.\n\nIt was around 9:00 PM on a Friday night, and there was a surprisingly decent amount of seating available for me and my two friends. There's bench seating to the left of the entrance, a few seats at the bar, some narrower barstool seating... And a LOT more seating (and a second bar) in the next room over. There's space for slightly larger groups to sit or stand around. Their website also says that they take reservations, which is perfect for a post-work outing with colleagues or friends.\n\nMy friends and I did the typical tiki thing and started off with the Jamaican Scorpion Bowl. It had a little more ice than preferred, but it was a refreshing and super rummy drink. Then we eat got our own drinks... And I had the witch doctor. Oh boy. No lie, I scanned the menu for which cocktail would do its job the best and fastest. The witch doctor did the trick. My friends got the Banana Life and Pineapple Express, which were also tasty. I think I would have been happy with any drink on the menu. \n\nPagan Idol is a great place to walk over after work and have a few drinks before having a real night on the town, which is what my friends and I did. The bartenders are a lot of fun, so don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with them. The drinks are kinda pricey, as is expected from a place like this, but it's the perfect way to treat yourself at the end of a long work month. Cheers!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

They own a bunch of themed bars with super deliciously-made cocktails. Pagan Idol is one of them.\n\nThe decor is BEAUTIFUL! Walking in, there's a well-lit aquarium on your left. Then, the bar. As you keep walking, you'll find bathrooms on your left up a few steps. There's also a bar in the back of the venue. But the most interesting part is in the far back passed the bar - there are \"stars\" on the ceiling and tiki huts on your right for reservations. There's also a super pretty \"volcano\" area in the corner, which is where our party was. The \"volcano\" area has a bunch of pretty lights and a fish pond. There's also a smoke machine that makes everything all smokey around the \"volcano\". I would say it's probably the most well-lit area in the bar.\n\nAnyway, when making reservations, definitely attempt Yelp Reservations first. We were a little late so there were no reservations available that day. So we called a few times - but apparently nobody answers their phones? So I emailed them. Got a call the following day about confirming reservations - lovely surprise! When we walked in, we let the people in the back bar know we had reservations. They cleared out the \"volcano\" area for us and set up a stool with a \"private luau\" sign on the deck.\n\nThere was PLENTY of space for us and the venue was GORGEOUS! I would definitely choose the \"volcano\" area over the tiki huts. The drinks were delicious, but the bowls were pretty small for the amount of people we had. When you get bowls of alcohol, you kinda mean for it to be shared with a bunch of people I think. But it also clearly states on the menu that it's meant for less than 6 people.\n\nThe service is wonderful as well! The man that led us to our reserved area served the bowls to us and gave us a little fire show. When one of us dropped a credit card at the end of the night, one of the ladies came around with a flashlight to help us look as well. Found it :) Thanks!", "author": "Athena C."}

If you've never tried an Old Fashioned made with rum, you're missing out.  It's so good to sip on.  While I wanted to do a more proper tiki drink, I just couldn't handle anymore juice in my system.\n\nThe decor inside of Pagan Idol was amazing.

I mean the props they have placed around the rooms, and the lighting are really cool. You could walk around for an hour and just stare at everything. \n\nMy only drink of the evening was the Ma Tai Float, which I would recommend for first timers here. It was a strong drink that had plenty of juice and looks like a true Tiki drink. The drinks here seem a bit on the pricey side but hey this is downtown SF. \n\nThe bartenders during this evening all were friendly and chill.

We had to wear suits, skirts, heels, strict grooming standards.  Now, people go to work wearing see-through yoga pants - casual much?  \n\nIf I worked nearby these days, I'd hop on over in my sweats and shake my tail feather to the background music with a \"Witch Doctor\" in hand, woot-woot!  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday night, sat at the bar and watched the bartenders (Dan & Johnny) in action.  They're extremely friendly and attentive; every drink is made with love.  We totally dig the vibe, not as cheesy as Tonga Room if ya feel me.  \n\nIt wasn't too crowded due to the beginning of Fleet Week in SF.  There were sailors looking lost in our fair city.  I directed them towards Broadway, as they were looking for titty bars and not tiki bars LOL!  I also thanked them for their service in protecting our beautiful country of course.\n\nOnto the drinks, the \"Bird of Paradise\" had too much ice in it, but \"Dawn Patrol\" was on point!  My friend's second drink was \"Flex on the Beach\" - reminded us of a slushy \"Hurricane\" in New Orleans, except in NOLA, you can walk on the streets with it.  Patrons can purchase souvenir mugs & glasses, prices are listed on the menu, if not...simply ask.  Walk towards the back and checkout the rear bar.

After being disappointed by Smuggler's Cove, I was glad to have found this place!  Pagan Idol has a lot more space, multiple bars, and great drinks!  While they have a back area, I've mostly hung out in the front, but that's because seating seems easier to find here.  The back does have reservable group party areas so definitely something to take a look into.  As for the atmosphere, it is a really cool tiki bar.  Relatively high ceilings and fairly spacious (by SF standards).  So it doesn't feel like I'm stuffed like a sardine.  The bar area gets busy, but it's not too hard to get a drink.  \n\nMy favorite drink here has to be the Bird of Paradise.  It is on the sour side though so just a forewarning.  But I love the passion fruit whip they put on top, it's super addictive!  I've had a few of their other drinks as well, they're pretty amazing.  \n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite bars in SF, not just among tiki bars.

It is fairly new. They've only been around for a little over a year. Night life was well and alive in this popular Polynesian / Bohemian-style tiki bar located in the Financial District. \n\nHad a fun time with a group of friends last night at Pagan Idol as some 18 of us gathered here for some great cocktail drinks and conversations. Shared a Bird of Paradise ($13) with the hubby... so good! It had a richer, sweeter margarita taste with passion-fruit-infused whipped cream and sprinkled with irresistibly tangy li hing mui (Hawaiian dried plum powder). I enjoyed that fruity taste (and I miss Li Hing Mui from Hawaii).\n\nWe originally had reservations at the elevated Volcano Room which erupts periodically, filling the room with smoke and even sound effects. So cool! We hung out there until we completely filled the space which occupied about 12 or so people. With that many people it eventually got hot as if we were really near a volcano LoL! We then moved to a larger space just below as our group got big.\n\nThis tiki bar is very interesting once you enter the door. It is dimly lit inside but I had a chance to do a quick visual of the place. It had amazing decor! Loved it! Immediately to your left is a fish tank and behind that is seating space. Then the bar... it looks like a ship's saloon in a sunken wooden ship. On the right there are portholes lining the wall and featured looping videos of fish and sharks swimming by. Nice \"under the sea\" effect. The bartenders were decked out in Hawaiian shirts and floral leis and ready to serve you their concoction cocktails that comes adorned with an orchid.\n\nThere is another bar inside the tiki room which they called the Captain's Quarters and is sectioned off from the rest of the establishment by a locked door (yes, we had to wait outside till it was ready). There is even a whimsy sign on the door (see my photo). Once we are allowed to wander inside you will find it hard not to notice a giant hand-carved tiki statue (could be the Hawaiian god, Lono. I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and learned a history of this stuff there). There are little seating sections where small to big groups can enjoy the spirit of the island - private grass huts, wicker stools and look up! the fiber-optic ceiling actually twinkles like the night sky. So cool! What a fun place for friends to enjoy our fruity drinks in ridiculously fun glassware (or pineapple). Music makes for a fun atmosphere! Oh, one more thing, don't look for food here... they don't serve appetizers or any food but the good news is Chinatown is close by for some authentic Chinese food. Also, over 21 only strictly enforced! They check ID's! Parking is horrible... good luck!\n\nReview #0696", "author": "May A."}

I dislike waiting for a bar place just to get drinks.  I didn't attempt to wait to get in for that one visit.  The second time to check this place out, it took an hour to wait yet again, in line, not to get in, but to get drinks.  It was about a whole hour in line to order and then have them make the drinks.  Sober talk while being thirsty. \n\nOn another note, it isn't just another bar, but a tiki spot with themed paradise drinks to delve into.  The decor is a good getaway, I'm not going to lie, from the working environment.  I like what this place is and it's conveniently located in FiDi.  I just wished that this place is bigger. \n\nBirds of paradise was ordered because I like the name.  They have the tiki bowls that is great for sharing.

However, you have to be patient, because EVERY drink they serve is gently assembled with hand crafted finesse so it takes a good 5 minutes to construct a simple whiskey/ginger (the orchid and striped straw gently placed just so.)\n\nThe back room opens at 5pm, so if you arrive 5 minutes before, you may have to wait in line outside if the front room is at the 20 head capacity. Although it is a large space with several nooks to crawl into, the empty space in the middle can feel like a high school dance floor with all the kids posted against the walls.\n\nThis is definitely a place to go for a lighthearted good time, or a good conversation starter for a first date.", "author": "jessica c."}

A doorman cockblocks the entry, checking to make certain all patrons are 21 and over and if he really needed my i.d. to prove such a thing then he's probably already lost his vision.   \n\nI made it inside.

You can actually reserve the whole place.  \n\nI wish I knew someone who would reserve the whole place.  I'd love that party.  \n\nPagan Idol's menu is about perfect and I sampled widely.  It's intriguing, with each drink looking more unique than the last.  I ordered at the bar and chatted up the bartender, learning that he'd spent many years working at Trader Vic's.  The pedigree shows.  Rum based drinks with flavors like passion fruit are potent and well prepared and dare I say it, reasonably priced.  At least by 2016 standards.  Have more than one of these and I suggest you Uber your way home.  \n\nAt regular intervals there's a startling clap of thunder followed by what must be theatrical smoke enveloping certain areas of the bar.  It's an experience.\n\nThe very rear of Pagan Idol is where I found room and, unfortunately, I understand why.  Though it features a decent view into other parts and you're there amidst tiki decor, the lighting in this part of the bar is a bit off and this space feels a bit like an afterthought.  I'd actually suggest it would be the perfect spot for a 3-person uke band but I'm not in charge.  \n\nEven if you wind up in the worst seat in the house you're gonna have fun here.  It's a tiki bar.

It's a great tiki bar, but I think Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago is still my most #1 favorite tiki bar of all.\n\nIt's great to see this new addition in the FiDi. More options for happy hours after work yay! The spooky pirate theme of a tiki bar is so much fun. $12 per drink is a great deal for FiDi price! Woohoo.", "author": "Hoyan L."}

Because Tiki Bars always makes me think that I'm in a far away place, away from work. And the people in Tiki Bars always seem to be in vacation, happy mode. \n\nI wasn't at Pagan Idol long enough to see the whole bar but from what I've seen, it definitely has that vacation feel. The bartenders and even the bouncer is sporting a Hawaiian shirt! \n\nI love it when bars put purse hangers near the seats. It's makes it so much more convenient for us ladies or lads with bags to socialize without worrying where to place our bags. \n\nTheir menu consists of lots of rum based tiki drinks and those cool looking fire tiki bowls. \n\nI got the banana life drink and it tastes really good, pretty strong, does not taste like bananas, but so much ice and so expensive! The drink costs $12 and that's definitely waaaay more than what I'm used to paying for a tiki drink. But then again, it is the SF FiDi... \n\nThe sad part of this bar is, no happy hour menu?!?

It was a stormy Saturday (March 5th) around 10:30pm.\n\nThe place was packed. We decided to do a walk through to get a feel for the layout of the bar. There's a main bar up front and another one in the back room. The back room didn't feel as crowded, but it was super stuffy, so we decided to find a space by the front bar. We ended up finding two stools along the wall, so we snagged those seats. Getting a drink proved to be a little bit of a challenge. It took a while to get the attention of the bartender to place an order. But once we did, it took no time at all. (I think everything was maybe pre-mixed?)\n\n*Bird of paradise: cachaca, reposado tequila, lemon, vanilla, passionfruit whip, li hing mui, sea salt ($12)\n*Mai tai float: rhum martinique, jamaican rum, ron de venezuela, orange liqueur, lime, orgeat, house float, aloha ($12)\n\nI'm honestly not a huge fan of tiki drinks as I more or less like my drinks straight up. These were a little too sweet for me. Out of the two, I preferred the Bird of paradise over the Mai tai. It was easier to drink and had a little tartness to it. That cut into the sweetness. I'm not big on rum, so I just had a sip of the mai tai.\n\nThe decor here is awesome. They have fake windows with screens behind them displaying water and swimming fish. Kinda like peering through an underwater porthole? It definitely feels like you're inside a ship with all the wood decor. And the lamps were so cute! I think they were supposed to resemble a kraken?\n\nSuper fun bar, but I'd only want to come back when it wasn't crowded. Would be a fun place to chill and enjoy a drink or two on a low key night.", "author": "Elena N."}

It probably started with my senior ball and going to the Tonga Room at the Fairmont in my heather blue tuxedo. The feeling only got bigger and messier when I was at the University of Chicago and found any excuse to down a scorpion bowl at the late, lamented Ciral's House of Tiki on East 53rd - finishing finals, finishing mid-terms, finishing the dark half plate at Harold's Chicken Shack down the street, passing by on the way to the L. Maybe that was why I was a bit giddy about this place, just the anticipation made my heart palpitate and my hips go into a hernia-threatening hula.\n\nJamie W. and I decided to stop by after a hearty meal at the newly refurbished Alfred's Steakhouse and hey, we were in a retro mood anyway. It wasn't too crowded at around 8PM on a Wednesday evening. What a cool set-up. You enter a room that looks like the inside of a pirate ship with a huge aquarium on the side. They need to get more fish though. Not that big a bar really but hopping (photo: http://bit.ly/227N75Y) and plenty of stools with too-narrow counters. Cool porthole with a video inside that reminded me of the submarine ride in Disneyland (photo: http://bit.ly/1P3dfWv). Pitch black in here, impossible to read the menu without your smartphone torchlight.\n\nDrinks are exactly what you expect at a tiki bar though a bit higher priced than what I remember from Ciral's. OK, a lot. Oh well, it is the FiDi after all. Jamie went for the $12 Bird of Paradise, quite a tall one with cacha\u00e7a, Reposado tequila, vanilla, li hing mui (salted dry plum), a whole lotta lemon and a passion fruit whip to make it all frothy (photo: http://bit.ly/1pAOFYe). It was tropically tasty with a kick. I went with the very rummy $12 Mai Tai Float with two types of Caribbean rum, orange liqueur, lime, and orgeat in something called a \"house float\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1Tz2MKe). It had the parasol and the pineapple and cherries on a bamboo skewer.\n\nIt looked innocent enough but wham! We first took our drinks to the stools and stared at the porthole, but then we decided to move to the much larger back room where they have little white lights, tiki huts, big carved tiki idols (photo: http://bit.ly/1UXuW0S), and rumor has it that there is a volcano that spews smoke. It was like being on the three-part Hawaii episode arc of \"The Brady Bunch\" when Greg wipes out in the surf due to Bobby's tiki idol. OK, not really. But we got a bench so we could watch the hipsters tapping on their smartphones. Oh look, they have a $25 Jamaican Scorpion Bowl, theoretically for three. We'll be back.\n\nCOCKTAILS - 4.5 stars...classic tiki drinks with a mule kick to the head soon after\nAMBIANCE - 5 stars...excellent job evoking Waikiki nights\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...bartender is super-energetic and friendly\nTOTAL - 5 stars...oh hell, it's a top-notch tiki bar...surf's up, dude", "author": "Ed U."}

Delicious rum based drinks and strong enough. \n\nTiki themed bars are my favorite! They went all out on the polynesian, island inspired theme. Impressed by their first room with the aquarium, the hull of a ship, and little details like the mermaid statue and naval striped back rests. Keep walking and you'll find bamboo everywhere. The grass huts for small groups with prior reservations and an active volcano! The ceiling emulates the night sky, sparkling and actually quite pretty but still keeping with the theme.

One time I came in and the top \"patio\" area was all booked for a birthday party. Everyone wore Hawaiian themed apparel, which I thought was a cool idea (might steal that idea).

We got a bowl (forgot which it was) and they lit it on fire. Love the decor. In one room, it felt like the inside of a ship and in the back, they had totems, tiki torches, a volcano, fishes, etc. I really liked the ambiance of the back room with the twinkling night sky on the ceiling. They even had fog machines go off every once in a while. Drinks are all at least $12 but they are definitely strong while tasting great.", "author": "Rebecca T."}

The drinks were all delicious, but you definitely pay for the extra effort that goes in to them. \n\nAt 7pm they rang a bell, made an announcement and opened the doors to their back room, which featured huge tiki heads, a ceiling with twinkling stars and a waterfall (with real fish swimming in it!)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "The line to worship the altar of the Pagan Idol starts behind me! I finally got the chance to check out San Francisco's newest, hippest, and liveliest tiki bar in the FiDi District! Founded by the team that brought us Bourbon and Branch, Pagan Idol is everything I imagine it would be and then some! The place was a sensory explosion for the eyes and the drinks were a flavor sensation for the taste buds! \n\nI was lucky enough to finally get a chance to experience the wonders of Pagan Idol when my good friend Christine and I were wrapping up a late night on the town and wanted one last place to get a fun yet festive nightcap in. The first place that came to mind was of course Pagan Idol. We have been dying to try this place out since they opened earlier this year but the timing and crowd was never right. Finally on a Wednesday evening in October, the timing was perfect. The crowd had a high tech meets hipster vibe was large but not overwhelming as I've seen driving by on the weekends.\n\nThankfully there is no cover charge, but there is someone outside checking IDs. Upon entry, you'll find a dimly lit paradise with whimsical decor everywhere you look. Tonight there was plenty of room to walk around, the space is divided into separate rooms and bars. Up front it's the \"Captain's Quarters\" which resembled an interior of a boat complete with portholes with actual screens of sea life in them. In the back, it resembled a traditional tropical bar complete with tiki sculptures, private dining areas, a starry night sky on the ceiling and even a working volcano! If you can judge a place by its interior, Pagan Idol would win hands down!\n\nBut we came for some tiki drinks and we really lucked out when the space on the front counter cleared up as soon as we approached it. (Proving that this trip was really meant to be!) After perusing the menu of about seventeen drinks, we asked our first bartender Dan what was popular here. He suggested we go with the Bird of Paradise with Cachaca, Reposado Tequila, lemon, vanilla, passion fruit whip, li hing mui and sea salt. It was a decent drink, but had way too much ice in it even though it was in a traditional tall hurricane glass. For my first drink, I decided to go with a Jungle Bird with pineapple infused Jamaican Rum, pineapple, lime, Campari, passion fruit and saline. (Saline? Um okay!) Both drinks were tropical and tiki inspired in every sense possible, for my friend's Bird of Paradise, although she loved it, for me, the hurricane glass was filled with way too much crushed ice and that disappointed me to a degree. My Jungle Bird drink was filled with just the perfect amount of ice versus liquid, was light, yet simply sweet, delicious, yet smooth. \n\nAfter taking in so much booze, I needed a quick respite before we headed into our second round of drinks, so I decided to order a simple Coke to cool me down. What I got was one of the most stunning drinks I've ever seen! A chilled Coke bottle served alongside a chilled tall glass with the longest ice cube I've every seen topped with a lovely orchid flower. It's was the perfect way to put a pause on the party, but also showed me the effort that the team at Pagan Idol puts into every drink they serve, including the nonalcoholic ones.\n\nFor our second round of tiki drinks, we went with the Dawn Patrol with Scotch, coffee liqueur, creme de cacao, lemon, cinnamon, and cream topped with toasted marshmallows and a maraschino cherry. My friend loved the pick me up aspect of her drink. I went with the Flex on the Beach with a blend of fresh rums with fresh peach, orange, lemon, apricot, and hibiscus. They had two sizes with this drink, our bartender Johnny told me to get the larger size served in a heavy yet totally festive tiki glass! Christine asked about how much it cost to buy a glass since they sold other cups for an optimum price and Johnny said it cost 15 dollars. When we decided to purchase two tiki glasses as souvenirs they gave a ten dollar discount when we bought two of them! As we contemplated our glassware purchase, I thought the Flex on the Beach felt more like a hurricane from Bourbon Street in New Orleans rather than a fabulous mixed tiki drink. It was a slushee poured from their margaritas machines on the the counter in back and wasn't expecting that at all. \n\nBut despite the disappointing last drink, I'd still totally go back to Pagan Idol, it's fun, festive and clean for a bar in the FiDi area of San Francisco. I'm always down for a good tiki bar especially one as nice as Pagan Idol. There's even a secret menu that you can ask your server for which apparently mainly consists of changes to drinks they already have on their menu, but it's always worth it to ask. Mondays thru Thursdays are the best time to come in because over the weekend it gets packed. When we finally got up to leave our bartender even got up to shake our hands at the door. I guess it was late they wanted us out! All the more reason to return in the future!", "author": "Jason F."}

I believe they are the sister bar to Local Edition(another great spot to check out) They do the whole tiki vibe to the max here. Occasionally random smoke pushes out of the ceiling and doses you in a heavy cloud. The ceiling is filled with twinkly lights to make it seem like a night sky. The air is balmy not sure if they are trying for that or it's just bad ventilation though. I really wish instead of smoke they shot out mist would help with the balmy temperatures. Fair warning this is a fairly new bar and it's really popular so it does tend to get packed. There is lots of space. There are two different bar sets ups. I went this past Friday and it was super packed. Th drinks are really good and some of the most aesthetically pleasing drinks I have seen in the city.

When you step inside, it's almost sensory overload. But it sure is fun! It's like Disneyland meets the Brady Bunch Goes to Hawaii episode.\n\nWhile most of my friends ordered sugary, tropical cocktails (which, to be honest, all sounded like variations of a Mai-Tai), I opted for the Rum Old Fashioned.

If you're looking to have intimate conversations with someone, this is definitely not the place.

The bartenders do a good job of making the drinks just strong enough without tasting too much like alcohol. \n\nThe place does get crowded - before 5pm, only the front room is open, so a good time to come would be a little bit before 5, so that once the back room opens up, you can be first in line at the bar in that room, minimizing your wait time. \n\nI was really impressed with their commitment to the theme, which definitely helps with the overall experience.

Walking in, you wouldn't expect it to be HUGE, this is more like a tiki sunken ship the place keeps going all the way into the back with little nooks and crannies to hang out in. Two large bars in the front and back with slushy machines, walls of rum and Hawaiian t-shirt wearing bartenders, how perfect. In all this place is fairly dim lit and slightly reminds me of being in some ride at Disney with the tiki theme, occasional gusts of smoke, tropical scenes, but with booze!\nAs to be expected, it was pretty packed for a Friday night after work but we were able to make our way to the bar to grab some drinks. I decided on the City of Refuge ($14) and my bf went for the Hemmingway is Dead ($12). Be patient, the drinks do take a bit longer than most places, but they are quite the masterpiece when you go get them, adorned with little umbrellas, perfectly cut lime wheels, beautiful flowers, etc. The drinks were great, super boozy but nicely balanced and not over sweet with fake ingredients like a lot of tiki bars have. You can tell the citrus ingredients are freshly squeezed and the spirits are top notch. I am not a huge fan of the slushy style drinks (hemmingway) as they tend to separate and become a watery mess when you're sipping on them so I do wish the menu would somehow note how your drink is being served, but that is just a personal preference for me. The drinks are on the higher side for other places in the area so I don't know how much I will frequent this spot, but a great place to check out one time and being out of town friends to experience.", "author": "Kelsey B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-18", "description": "Pagan Idol has the best-tasting cocktails in the city, period. \n\nI've been here several times and have never once had a bad one; only excellent ones no matter what I ordered. The level of craftsmanship that goes into creating each cocktail is impressive. \n\nMost of the cocktails are complex, yet the ingredients always just work well together and the attention to even the littlest details is always apparent. I also appreciate how consistent the drinks are from visit to visit. I've never once thought, \"oh, XYZ was better the last time I was here.\" The bartenders are terrific; high energy, enthusiastic but always consummate professionals. It's fun to sit at the bar and watch them make the cocktails but you have to go early to score a seat at the bar.\n\nMy three favorite drinks are the Bird of Paradise (the passionfruit whipped cream on top is insanely good), the Witch Doctor (gorgeously nuanced like a really good chai thanks to the spices; alas, they no longer serve it in the voodoo mug; you have to purchase it as a souvenir) and the lime-based daiquiri (which is simpler than any of their other cocktails but executed perfectly -- the best I've ever had -- and a relative bargain as it's $2 less than most of the other cocktails on the menu).  \n\nThe space itself is exquisitely designed, a Disneyland for adults in the best possible way. There are so many things to look at...the Kraken chandelier, the digital portholes that make you feel like you're in the belly of a ship, the starry skies overhead, the skulls underneath the stairs, the tiki huts in the back, the faux volcano that erupts periodically, the fish tank with the cutest fish (I've never watched Finding Nemo, but I'm pretty sure you can find a live-version Nemo in the tank), etc., etc. It is simply the most visually arresting and aesthetically interesting bar I've ever been to. \n\nOn the downside, it's so dark that it's practically impossible to take good photos of either the drinks or the space. Oh well. \n\nIt's obvious a lot of thought went into the details and it makes for a very escapist experience. Going to Pagan Idol is like taking a vacation to a place that doesn't exist in real life but is rather an idealized amalgamation of tropical places you've never visited and will never will visit because they don't exist. But that's what Tiki is when it's at its best: an escapist fantasy. \n\nAs a final note, I've also been to Smuggler's Cove a few times (which often gets compared to Pagan Idol). Their drinks are a bit less tasty in my opinion but more potent (Puka Punch!) and their menu is far more extensive (several pages long, in fact). Both spots are absolutely worthy visits, though I like Pagan Idol just a bit more. \n\nGo to Smuggler's Cove to get an education on Tiki history via their expansive menu and to explore traditional Tiki drinks that use more historical recipes; go to Pagan Idol to get modern (and better-tasting IMO) interpretations.", "author": "Maya B."}

This drink has a mix of scotch, creme de cacao, coffee liqueur, lemon, and topped with a toasted marshmallow garnish (so if you want to see the bartender pull out a blow torch, get this drink!).

This mostly has to do with the theme music playing with bird calls and lighting. The bartenders are very friendly and helpful when it comes to suggesting drinks. They have plenty of cocktails to choose from, I ended up going with Flex on the beach. It was pretty sweet but I also tried the jungle drink and that was good if you're a fan of pineapples. There's plenty of seating in the front and back which is good for groups. I now see why tiki bars are popular", "author": "Trisha S."}

Once they opened the back part of the restaurant, it was like a whole new world. So much room for activities! \n\nVery cool vibes, all tropical rum drinks, has a pirate-y feel.

I adored the Mai Tai Float and Pineapple Express and the Witch Doctor was weird but delicious (I think it comes with a hex, so maybe that's the unique taste we experienced). The portholes with the fish and the faux rainstorms are key and the decor is on-point.\n\nBartenders were pleasant and doing an amazing job with the crazy huge crowd and multi-ingredient concoctions. Despite the line out the door they do a decent job of keeping it not-too-crowded, so folks can make their way to the bar or find a place to stand/lean.\n\nOnce the line dies down I'd probably up this to 5 stars (or perhaps when I'm able to score a table ahead of time). Otherwise, I found this place not-so-handicapped friendly as I had to stand on one leg in line for a bit (you have to wait for enough people to leave before you can get inside). Then once we were in, chairs were pretty hard to come by.

There's a front section when you first enter that's kind of narrow but has a bar. Near the window you can seat a dozen people on a long couch with tables. There's a bar with bar seating and stools along the wall. When we went there were only 2 very overworked looking bartenders at this bar. The back room has a few awesome booths in almost separate rooms (get those!), a few wooden stools but overall not much seating. There's a bar back there too. There's also a small intimate seating room.\n\nThe quirkiness of the place and decor made me like it immediately. From the awesome lit-up peacock mosaic over one of the bars to the giant chair to the ship viewing hole simulating the ocean and fish swimming outside to the tiki huts that have booths, Pagan Idol did an awesome job of making a bar environment I could spend awhile in.

The presentation of the drinks is done well with care, but the price is definitely not worth the drink. You get more alcohol in your drink in Vegas (or anywhere else for that matter) for the same price. Come here if you have already had a lot to drink or don't want to drink much. The place is new and everyone in the city wants to check it out so you may experience a wait before entering. On a Friday night it took about 10 minutes for our group to get in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-27", "description": "Pagan Idol is a decent enough tiki bar in downtown San Francisco. We arrived at 6 PM and the place was already mobbed with millennials. More on that later. \n\nThe drinks were fair to good. We started off with the Jamaican Scorpion Bowl for two ($25). It was presented in a surprisingly small tiki bowl with a gardenia and fresh nutmeg on top. A little bit bigger than a normal drink. We were warned to bring the bowl back to the bar when we were done, otherwise we would be charged $75. :( It was good, but it was really sweet and lacking in rum. Isn't that what you come to a tiki bar for anyway? I'd give it a 4/10. \n\nNext, my wife had a Daywalker ($15) and I had a Witch Doctor ($12). The Daywalker was quite good and boozy. It was served in a tall glass with fresh mint and crushed ice. Not too sweet, and the over proof rum, absinthe, and bitters combined to give it a spicy note. The bartender said that drink had as much alcohol as the scorpion bowl. The Witch Doctor was a well-balanced drink. The egg white gave it some definite mouth feel that was quite interesting. It was served in a green Witch Doctor mug and also served with fresh mint. The Daywalker was 9/10 and the Witch Doctor was 8/10. These drinks were more on a par with Smuggler's Cove.\n\nThe bar itself is full-on tiki with the usual adornments plus some really nice ones. The two large tiki carvings are spectacular and I love the kraken lighting in the front bar. The back bar was very dark, but had a cool starlit ceiling. Definitely needs better ventilation with crowds this size. Nice exotica music playing overhead. There were probably seven busy bartenders amongst three different bars. The bars were all about 5 people deep. We used the single bartender in the very back corner. Nice guy who seemed to really enjoy his job.\n\nThe bar itself was really crowded, warm due to the crowd, and quite sticky due to all the millennial's spelling their sweet drinks. Here's a tip: When you're done ordering your drink move away from the bar to drink it. Others would like to order their drinks, too. Here's another tip: Don't wear a backpack in a crowded bar. I saw five different people wearing backpacks who would pivot around and cause people to spill or drop their drinks. Have some common sense. The guy at the front door checking IDs should tell people to remove their backpacks when it's crowded.\n\nOverall our experience was ok, but not great. Most of that was due to the crowd and their seemingly oblivion to others, but hey, isn't that what being a millennial is all about? It will be interesting to see how this bar does after the newness and crowds die down. I'll be back when it does.", "author": "Jeff G."}

I have family and friends in the City and my wife and I visit regularly.  Last week while celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary week (yes, a whole week because after 25 years, that's how we roll) my sister recommended Pagan Idol as one of our stop overs.  She mentioned they had a large room in the back with another full bar that opened later in the evening. We dropped in on Thursday around 5pm, it was pretty full.  We decided to go across the street to get a bite to eat and returned around 6:30.  They had opened the back area & we were able to find two seats at the front bar.  We started with one of my favorite Tiki cocktails of all time, Mai Tai's; a perfect blend of rums and essence of almonds and oranges. By the end of the our 1st drink we started to notice the fish swimming by the port holes (nice touch), it felt and looked like we were in the bottom of a wooden ship. This is a really nice Tiki Bar; they respect the culture and the cocktail. \n\nTime for round 2.  We asked mixologist extraordinaire Nick to create a concoction to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. He whipped up a double Bird of Paradise that was spectacular. A nice blend of tart from the fruit juices and sweet from the cream and it packed a punch from the rum. \n\nFor my 3rd drink I went back to the Mai Tai (so damn good) and my wife ordered a Saturn, a rare gin-based Tiki drink which in her words \"made me orbit\". I could taste lemon, passion fruit, oranges, almonds, ginger, cloves and vanilla.  I didn't taste the gin, which I like all on it's own. It was a creeper and I had to finish it for her :) She said that walking back to the hotel (7 blocks) was going to be out of the question so we Uber'd it back.\n\nPagan Idol is bustling with locals & tourists alike, hipsters & business people & old married folks like us. Wait, we're only 50, who am I calling old?! They have one of the most talented teams of mixologist's I have ever seen. They work fluidly (no pun intended) together.

As far as the crowd it ranged from youngings like myself to an older late 30s crowd. I'll regret thinking that's old later on. But overall a pretty classy crowd, no one was overly obnoxious or drunk.

Fortunately now there is an alternate proposition!\n\nThe interior is very well done, definitely in the top 10% of Tiki themed bars. From the cartography themed restrooms, to the fish tanks behind the bar, to the volcano in the back that occasionally blows a plume of smoke, this place does a great job of setting the tropical mood. It is also fairly large inside, with tables in both the front and back, barstools on some of the edges, and a large standing area in the back.\n\nCocktails were also quite tasty. Favorite of the evening was the Maybe Grog. It was strong, but also delicious. Best of all it came with a stick of rock candy, which was a delightful addition I had never seen on a drink before.

The crowd cleared, spreading out to enjoy much more space. \n\nIn the back, the still-lively bar feels much more open and relaxed.

Out of the 5 I tried only 2 were really something I would drink again,  1 was not served to us full and 2 were  were complete busts and really unbalanced. I would blame it on it being Saturday night and pretty steadily busy but when you order the drink twice and it tastes the same both times its the recipe. \n\nRum Monkey -- has zero flavor. It just tastes like ...well nothing really. For such an expensive bowl this drink should pack some punch. Not taste like the last sip from a punch bowl. We all didn't even want to finish it because it was so flavorless but when you spend a lot for just one drink well...you might as well.\n\nWitch Doctor -- was well balanced and definitely the best out of the bunch.  Really thought the juice/rum combination had great flavor -- there just needs to be less ice. I drink tiki drinks often and expect crushed ice...just not an entire glass of it where I have to search for the cocktail. \n\nBird of Paradise -- topped off with passionfruit whip cream this was pretty good also.  Great, tart  flavor...I could drink this again although to be honest I would do it for the whip cream. Besides the tartness I couldn't even tell you what was in it.   Ice to drink consistency was spot on.  \n\nCity of Refuge -- man this drink was way too heavy on lavender.  It was like drinking a sachet or potpourri .  I like lavender but it is such a powerful flavor when overused.  Note to you all..less is more...like a LOT less\n\nBanana Life -- this drink was pretty tasty however we ordered one and it was pretty full , we ordered a second and it was 2/3 full.  Yea..don't do this. \n\nBecause the bar is staffed by pros who definitely never looked freaked out by the size of the crowds waiting I would say the drink recipes need tweaking because these bartenders can handle the drinks they are making...in the case of the Rum Monkey a major overhaul.  \nAfter Pagan Idol we went over to Longitude in Oakland and the 1 drink I had there was better than all 5 drinks I had at PI.  I am in no ways a cocktail snob but I like strong flavors...none of the 5 I tried were strong enough to say \"Man I need to go back and get ______..that drink was killer!\"\n\nI realize the bar hasn't even been open a week yet so things always improve and overall they did a pretty great job for a Saturday night that seemed super steady. I want to reiterate how great the staff was. I never saw them do anything but smile and even when they were in the weeds unless you were paying attention they never showed it. THAT is pretty awesome. \n\nI know they plan on adding cocktail servers (SO SMART and NEEDED!) and reservations even down the road but in the meantime Label the bathrooms, print more menus (which I know they are already doing--paper menus tend to get soggy but at least don't cost a lot when they get stolen!), have the line marked off outside so people know in which direction to line up (so we don't anger your neighbors), and the staff needs to be identifiable...not uniforms per se but you could easily have printed shirts made like Trader Vic's does so we can tell who is working there and who is just drinking there. \n\nOverall a solid 5 stars for d\u00e9cor and 3 stars for the drinks.  I think they can greatly improve on their cocktails and hope they do. I would love to make Pagan Idol a regular stop on my cocktail route but for now I will take folks there to see the place and after we have hung for awhile take them elsewhere so they can try better, more memorable drinks.\n\nIt's a beautiful bar and when the drinks catch up to the interior the place is going to give other tiki bars a run for  their money.", "author": "Liz K."}

A solid addition to the Bay Area Tiki scene.\n\nFirst thoughts: a lot of wood, wicked lamps, solid drinks, and great bartenders.\n\nFirst off, parking during a weekday is a bit cumbersome. Your best choice is probably the Sutter-Stockton garage. Super low rates for SF, and less than two blocks from Pagan Idol.\n\nThe outside is fairly nondescript, per the usual SF Tiki code. Walking in the first thing you notice is that the entire place is covered in handsome wood, ceiling to floor. In fact the feeling I got was that of entering an overturned shipwreck.\n\nGrabbed a seat at the bar, which was a little difficult. Not because it was crowded, but because many of the stools are burdened with a bar-affixed lamp that  basically blocks the entire bar. Perhaps if they could make those a little taller it would open up more bar space.\n\nGrabbed a menu, which is very similar to the one they have Forbidden Island in Alameda. They have some of the Tiki standards, supplemented with the bars own creations. I had the Maybe Grog and the Mai Tai Float. Both drinks were excellent.\n\nI think the best part of the bar were the bartenders. They were available but also left you to your own devices. The perfect blend of checking in without being a nuisance. Drinks came out quickly and calmly.\n\nI was a bit disappointed that Pagan Idol didn't have custom mugs or swizzle sticks available, but perhaps those will come along later. All in all a very enjoyable first experience.

The second one, which is located more on the inside is so convenient because you can avoid the first bar that is crowded with people and get your drinks much faster in the second bar location. \n\nI usually go to smuggler cove for tiki bars but I'm more glad that the pagan idol is here cause its so much easier to get in and actually have a conversation with people cause you have the space to sit here!", "author": "Cavin T."}

So when I noticed this bar on a blog was opening in the Financial District I just had to check it out ...and apparently so did everyone else.\n\nThe staff here was outstanding. Their personalities were very positive, warm and even making jokes setting the perfect upbeat get away atmosphere you'd expect from a tiki bar.\n\nWe tried about half the drinks on menu. Most of them tasted very stiff with way too much ice that it felt more like a snow cone with not enough fruity flavors that are very common with tiki drinks. Generally people like myself who love rum drinks are wanting something flavorful and tasty. Something that tastes so good you'd slam it down, but it can deceive and creep up on you. Kind of like their version of the Zombie called The Daywalker -- hands down their best drink.\n\nThe bar itself was featured in a blog that stated its design was fashioned as a greatest hits of other popular tiki bars, but when I got inside parts of it felt lackluster and cheap while other decor looked great. A lot of the lighting didn't seem turned on and the volcano was off the entire time we were there. My partner and I took a closer look at it and it looked really cheaply designed. Then again it's pretty hard to top the production design of the Tonga Room which was designed by an MGM set designer.\n\nThe bar was really packed full of yuppie FiDi techies sharing their first-world problems about work. There were lines going out the front door for quite a bit. There were also lines at all the bars, so a friend had to hold a sitting spot while the other fetched drinks. To add an extra layer of annoyance, these girls dressed as \"baby sluts\" were cutting in front of this gay man thinking their drunken charm and smile would get them a pass -- only to hear them order a vodka tonic at a TIKI RUM DRINK BAR. Yeah no, it's called take your bridge and tunnel east bay lookin' asses to the back of the line like the rest of us boo-boo.\n\nOverall it's great to have a tiki bar in this side of SF, but right now it's best to avoid it for a few months until the trendiness wears off and they shake out all the kinks with their drinks.", "author": "Terry C."}

Where there are automatronic birds singing catchy jingles. There's fake stars on the ceiling and fake potted plants and huts with tree-stump like tables. It really speaks to whatever Asian part of me that also loves the neon lights and shiny skyscrapers of Shanghai and Hong Kong. Very much like the Tonga Room... except for lazy folks like me you don't have to scale Nob Hill to reach it.\n\nThat being said. I tried two drinks and they're adequately good. But they don't feel very special or superior - and they're more twice the price of Trad'r Sam (where you can get a giant boozy scorpion bowl for $14 that 3-4 people can get properly buzzed off of). Would prefer the drinks either become more creative or the prices to come down (not going to happen... so hopefully the drink menu gets more varied).", "author": "Sylvia L."}

Pagan Idol is awesome.\n\nI used to a visit a tiki bar in downtown San Mateo all the time when I lived down there, and I may have found my new go-to. The drinks are fantastic, and their descriptions are so fun: including ingredients like happiness and ancient curses in addition to the usual bevy of tropical rums and fruit juices. They're definitely strong, but totally worth it. I highly recommend splitting a punch bowl with some friends, and watch in awe as they light your drink on fire.\n\nThe decor is what really sets this place apart though. It starts from the exterior; the entrance looks like the door to a tiki hut, and the first room you enter has a bunch of candlelit tables, kraken-like tentacles coming out of the wall, and a large fish tank. You then go to a second room where you truly feel underwater. It's darker, and there are aquarium-like tanks behind the bar that really add to the underwater feeling. Beyond that, there are tiki huts with a star-lit ceiling and various weather and volcano effects. There's even an elevated area with neat jungle decor. Absolutely check this place out if you're in the area.", "author": "Nikhil S."}

Pagan Idol delivers all the best aspects of the classic tiki lounges of the past, and then some.  Bottom line: For an outrageous great tiki bar experience, Pagan Idol is a major win.  For more info, read below:\n\nDRINKS:\nAn impressive tiki cocktail menu sports mostly house specialties, with variations on the classic recipes ( Maybe Grog is their Navy Grog ).  The drinks are made with extreme care and presented beautifully. The recipes are well balanced and taste appropriately complex.  Great.\n\nDECOR:\nThis is where Pagan Idol really excels.  The front room has a bar, where the tone is more relaxed, more light available, but still with awesome tiki decor and flavor. It then goes into a back room which features a beautiful second bar, with amazing decorations along the back wall.  There is a star-lit ceiling, and private huts in the back area.  It's spacious with fun nooks and crannies for parties to enjoy themselves.  There's an elevated area in the back with a cool tropical jungle scene.\n\nMUSIC:\nAgain, spot on. Ambient music features Martin Denny style exotica.  Appropriate mid-century Polynesian romanticized soundtrack.  Great.\n\nAMBIENCE / CLIENTELE:\nMy visit was during the soft opening period, so it wasn't super crowded yet, but the interior is spacious enough that I can't imagine it ever getting too crazy inside.  Bartenders were very lively and excited about the cocktails.  One of the managers even took time to talk to me briefly about the bar.  It has a welcoming vibe, dark lounge atmosphere, great time.\n\nBONUS:\nTiki bars will sometimes have a few extra pieces of fun. This one features a periodic atmosphere-changing effect, in form of a thunderstorm.  Lights flash, thunder claps, and mist and fog fills the back room area.  As this is a Tiki-Exotica theme bar, it's appropriately great.\n\nI'm so happy that Pagan Idol is part of the new tiki family.  Hats off to the owners, and I hope it stays around for a long time.", "author": "David B."}

The bar is gorgeous and gives off a really cool vibe, you feel like you're in some magical world. I came here on a Friday night around 9pm to hang out with a girlfriend and catch up. There was no line & no cover! This is one of those bars that you come to with friends to just hang out; it never gets too packed so you can actually hear each other and have a conversation.  Finding a table is fairly easy, and they also have these cool huts for a group sizes that seem fun. The cocktails are yummy and super cute! I was disappointed with my first drink however, it was one the bartender suggested called the Flex on the Beach. It comes out of a slushy machine which takes away from the drink even though at the end she added decor to make it pretty, it still made me upset that I had ordered it. There was a fire drink that a lot of groups were ordering out of a bowl, so if you want something fun, go this route! The bar is pretty big, and there are actually two rooms, the one in the back is bigger and has more things going on. \n\nSuggestions, order your drinks at one time for your group. The bartenders put a lot of work into making most of the drinks, so it takes a lot of time and you don't want to be going back and forth.

They pivoted to something very much their own (see first paragraph).\n\nThe bar is still young, and still coming together, but when you walk through into the second act of the bar.... their deft talent and potential is readily apparent.\n\nAs for the cocktails, only tried out two tonight, but they were both very good.

JP took great care of us and din't flinch when we decided to order off-menu as well. You can tell that there are some regulars who give this fi-di hotspot a neighborhood feel. I'm sure with the after-work crowd they get their fair share of douchebaggery, but I get the impression the staff would be the kind to make sure everyone can relax and have a good time.\n\nOnly thing I can't figure out is how they feed all those fish in the giant aquarium behind the opposite wall.

First, the good:  really cool space.  Love the theme and the decorations and the artificial smoke.  The drinks are well crafted and tasty with lots of fresh ingredients.  The bartenders are smooth, tolerant, professional and friendly.  The only fault being when I asked for a zombie, they acted like I was some kind of idiot.  Umm..a zombie is a pretty standard Tiki bar drink.  I have been drinking them at Frankie's in Vegas for about 15 years.  Anyway these guys have a tough job grinding out these time consuming cocktails.  All in all I like the place for what it is.  There are some minor flaws - 1) Parking sucks. A couple garages in the area charging $12 flat rate...Take a rideshare. 2) I know these drinks take a lot of time and have a couple of shots in them, so I don't mind at all paying a premium price, but the bowls for the shared drinks are very small, and I finished my grog in about 3 sips and was left with a full glass of crushed ice.  \nSo - a great place to meet up, enjoy the ambiance and have a couple of cool, tasty cocktails and move on.  I can't drink all that high priced sugar all night.  They have a spirits list, but it's mostly rum (at up to $65 for a shot).  I will definitely be back.", "author": "Ken P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-03", "description": "I'm giving 5 Stars - And let me tell you why. Most people will remove stars for trivial issues like sugary drinks (it's a Tiki Bar, do you not know that ALL Tiki cocktails are practically built off rum and sugared juices?), the service (it's a NEW BAR, everyone wants to be there, the staff is going to be swamped) and how long it takes to get a drink (again, Tiki drinks are craft cocktails, they are not simple well cocktails or three ingredient drinks you shake on up)..so naturally they will take a long time, have long lines, and be some of the sweetest cocktails you've had - that's just how Tiki bars have been and likely always will be as long as people frequent them in this resurgence of 60s kitsch. \nSo why the 5 stars? The menu is simple - it has some great classics, awesome new cocktails, and house specials. It's not a large menu, but has quite the selection The Mai Tai's are spot on, the Navy Grog has that Orgeat meets \"tropical gum\" type flavor, and the Daywalker is pretty much a zombie, named from an employees love of The Walking Dead - makes sense, after drinking it, I was ripped and felt like I was wondering aimlessly around this bar.\n\nThe decor - this is where they shine bright like a diamond, or in their case, shine bright like a star - and there are plenty of stars that flicker in the night sky. With a black ceiling, fiber optic lights through out mimic the night sky over a beach resort complete with tiki huts that sit 4-6 (you won't ever get one of these no matter how hard you try, unless you get there and wait in line and are literally the first people waiting for hours before they open) - and yes, there is foliage, and the fantastic volcano/waterfall combination with little lagoon at the bottom. Again, mostly fiber optic simulations but it's too charming to care that its not done all LED light style like other bars have been creative with. Beside, optics allow them to change things over time, and do not get damaged. Attention to detail in the video screen fishtank portals in the Captains Quarters in the front side of the bar. Be sure to look up, see the Kraken lighting fixtures. Part Pirate, Part classy ship, part shipwreck on a South Pacific Island.\n\nThis place gets PACKED. Like to the point other bars like Tonga Room and Smugger's Cove get, where only some are allowed in, others made wait till the space clears out a bit. It's normal and natural for all new themed bars to do this, I don't understand why people have a problem and think things are \"overrated\" by that. Be a tiki die-hard fan, and not just a lush, and you will love this place and realize its worth. I sure do!", "author": "William D."}

The first time I was helped nicely with one guy going and checking the lost-and-found for me and eventually returning to tell me no luck. However, I later remembered I hung it from one of those purse hooks under the bar and decided to go back and double check. After waiting for somebody to help me for awhile (it was busy) I saw somebody head into the back area of the bar (where I left my jacket) and figured I would just go back and look for myself. No dice. However, I then asked a server back there about my jacket only to realize it was the same person I talked to earlier. He recognized me and gave me a BS line that he would only talk to me about it further if I went back into the main bar area. Apparently the back area of the bar was reserved for a private party I had stumbled onto for a few moments while looking for my jacket. I apologized and left, but the server was clearly not actually going to follow me and just said that to get me to leave. Rude!

Their very large doorman is a class act and fabulous employee. If I ran a bar I'd want someone just like him at the door.", "author": "Braxton C."}

I got to Pagan Idol around 7:40pm earlier this evening and it was packed.  I ordered a Banana Life and friends got a drink called The Witch Doctor.  These tiki drinks were great, but the only things I have against Pagan Idol, which are fixable over time are the need for air conditioning (its as if the Tiki bar came with authentic Tiki Lounge weather) and the speed at which drinks are made (we waited 5-8 minutes per drink).", "author": "Brian L."}

One of, if not THE best bartenders i've ever seen in action! Im rarely impressed and i was very impressed with her work!\n\nWe enjoyed the Daywalker, the Banana life and others, but by far the best drink was the Witch Doctor. So complex and absolutely delicious! \n\nWe got there before the rush, but when we left, there was a line around the corner!", "author": "Kristopher C."}

We sat at the bar, got to meet a TON of very cool tiki people and had a wonderful evening. We went again a week ago and boy, how a couple weeks changes things. We went on a Friday night, which probably made a huge difference in the crowd. It was CHOCK FULL of twenty something singles trying to make moves on one another, all probably coming straight from their jobs in the financial district. Not at all like the crowd on the first visit. It wasn't a tiki bar atmosphere at all, just another pick up joint. That was disappointing. They removed the stools from the upper bar so it was just standing room only and people were herded through the ordering process and sent on their way. Again, disappointing. \n\nThis is a BIG SPACE on the second level but has minimal seating. Mostly you have to just stand around with your drinks and hold them or most the seating is all along the walls so you are backed up against the wall like you are at a middle school dance. There is all this empty space and... people. People standing in clumps everywhere. Kind of makes you feel like they don't want you to stay. Have your cocktail and move on. \n\nWe have been twice and between the two visits, we've tried probably 8 cocktails total off the menu. The drinks definitely were better our first go round and the second time, they were weak. Our first trip, we each had three drinks a piece. This time, one and done. I would much rather go the Forbidden Island in Alameda for a cocktail that stands up to it's rating on the menu with the atmosphere to back it up. Pagan Idol is a kitschy place to go for novelty but if you want a real tiki drink hit up Longitude, Tonga Room, Trader Vic's (In Emeryville) or Forbidden Island. I can guarantee you will have a more memorable visit.", "author": "S C."}

I was looking for shelter from what had become an unsalvageable evening and alas in the horizon appeared the Pagan Idol. To my surprise it's like being immediately transported into the belly of a pirate ship. Great drinks, volcanic eruptions, and Caribbean tunes created the ultimate escape into another world.

If you like the ambiance of the Tonga room, but are looking for something a little less touristy, this is your spot. Try a volcano drink with friends, or one of their blended cocktails. FYI, the themed cups are for sale! There is not really any music, which is great if you are looking to talk to the person you are with, but not as fun for a rowdy night.", "author": "Sharon R."}

They need to figure out some logistical issues because at ~3 minutes per drink times 5 bartenders they simply can't handle a crowd that size. Like others said the back is a bit stuffy especially when it's crowded. Will return another time, some of the drinks looked pretty promising. Can't rate then on that though since I walked away thirsty.", "author": "James D."}

Luckily 2 of my friends were already inside so it was just me and my other friend waiting to get in. I was worried that the wait would take a while but the line moved fairly quickly and we were inside within 15 minutes. Right when you walk in, it's almost like instant darkness. But the theme and decorations inside were really cute! And the drink menu had a good amount of tasty looking drinks to choose from! Since I gave up hard alcohol for the year, I got this pineapple cider that was super refreshing and tasty! :) My friends got a few round of the tiki drinks and one of them was the scorpian bowl, which can be shared between 2-3 people. The bar is really nice especially with the aquarium in the background. Overall, this tiki bar is a pretty neat place to grab some yummy drinks with some friends and just hangout. But it does get pretty loud and crowded in here so come early!", "author": "Mary C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-20", "description": "Walked in to an incredibly dark, small bar after work around 5:30. Bamboo on the walls, fake palm fronds, kitschy but kind of charming at the same time. There were a few tables in the front, but I wandered farther back and found that there was a hallway leading to a separate section of the place that was three times as large, as well as having another bar. Ordered a \"Witch Doctor\" from an exceptionally cheery and friendly bartender. $12 and about 5 full minutes later (a lot of ingredients) but it was indeed delicious and strong. Later on (7ish) the bar got pretty backed up and it took about 20 minutes to get a round. The back was even darker than the front and I literally used my phone flashlight to find people and read the drink menu. There was a lot more tiki themed decorations in the back, even the tables were logs and the stools were bamboo and wicker. Not my first choice for an after work bar because it was a bit expensive, and unnecessarily dark at 5:30 on a Tuesday, but I'd go to another happy hour there.", "author": "Nick H."}

Definitely has a similar vibe as Tonga Room (though perhaps a younger crowd) and Smugglers Cove (though more spacious and \"newer\"). On a Thursday around 7, there was a decent size crowd - big enough to make you feel like you were somewhere hip but not so packed that you couldn't find somewhere to sit. Lots of after-work folks.

The Witchdoctor was also really good with some nice spice and a less rum forward taste.  Highly recommended to check out.", "author": "Nate B."}
