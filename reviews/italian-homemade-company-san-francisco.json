It's a tiny eatery with just a few tables and seating along the window facing the main street. As it approached the dinnertime rush, the line of customers extended out the door and many locals stopped in to pick up takeout orders. \n\nTheir menu is straightforward with no frills and you receive exactly what you would expect. Don't forget to glance at the board on the back wall that lists a couple of the day's specials. Once we ordered, we snagged a table that had a direct view behind the counter. Two cooks were solely focused on pasta and sandwiches, one employee remained at the cash register and one waiter served all the food. Considering the rush of customers constantly in and out, the staff is pretty efficient at preparing orders in a timely manner. For the pasta dishes, they just heat up the sauce, toss in the pasta until it's completely heated, serve on a simple paper plate and top with Parmesan (if you wish). Then it's good to go!  \n\nOn the traditional menu, I ordered their House Special Lasagna ($13) and it was humongous!  The layers of pasta were al dente and I enjoyed the hearty bolognese sauce. I was surprised that it didn't seem to have any distinct layers of ricotta cheese, but it must have been mixed in. Nevertheless, the lasagna was delicious and not overly heavy. It tasted very fresh and authentic as if they've been following the same family recipe for years (which very well could be the case)! \n\nTwo others in my group had pasta dishes (tagliatelle and ravioli) with bolognese as well, which they both enjoyed. Both appeared so fresh and portion sizes in general here are huge.  One item that turned out to be a miss was the sausage and pepper flatbread sandwich as the sausage tasted under-seasoned  My advice is to order a pasta dish since that is their main specialty. \n\nI'd recommend Italian Homemade if looking for a quick and affordable spot to fulfill your pasta cravings!", "author": "Courtney L."}

Italian Homemade is every bit as good as the raves reviews have stated. Yes I know I'm late to the party, but I don't live here so I get a pass. \n\nLet me set the scene. Well there's really no way to set up chaotic. Chaotic in the best way, like a European street market. It's loud, theres music, service staff yelling out order names, melodic Italian words being spoken behind the counter, theres a ginormous line out the door, people are weaving in and out of small creases in search of water, utensils, and the all important empty table. Glorious glorious chaos.\n\nThe name is so fitting. I've had Italian food all over, including the mother land, Italy. This is every bit as good and very similar to the homemade taste you'll find in Italy. The lasagna is worth the price of admission. The portion sizes are also quite deceiving.\n\nThis is one of those times I wish I were one of those animals with 2 stomachs.

I told myself it was to try more menu items in order to give a fair review, but honestly, I just really like their pasta.\n\nNorth Beach has a lot of restaurants that definitely cater to tourists. Nothing wrong with that, but personally I'm not down to pay $25+ for mediocre Italian food. Thankfully, the average amount you'll spend here (after tax and tips) is about $18, so we're off to a good start already. \n\nThe interior is very simple, with not a lot of seating. Most patrons seem to follow the rule of \"order first before taking a seat\" that the restaurant has taped to the wall, so don't worry too much about not getting a seat unless the line is out the door. \n\nWhat can I say? This place exemplifies \"less is more\", as the dishes are literally just pasta with your choice of a sauce. The fresh pasta has a nice bite to it, and the sauces were all fantastic. My only gripe would be the tagliatelle sometimes sticks together into a clump - it wasn't particularly pleasant to bite into.\n\nIf you want comfort food in the form of carbs, come here. It's tasty, unpretentious, and definitely somewhat addictive.", "author": "Calvin Z."}

As soon as you walk into their facility, they ask that you order your food first before sitting down.  The inside is SO charming, and the homey music gives the ambiance such a sweet feel.  Once we ordered the food came out within 7 minutes, so steamy, so fresh.\nThere's no line around 12:30 Saturday!  We had to try this place out because of all the good things we've heard from it and we were definitely not disappointed!  \nI can imagine that during their busier hours though that the lack of space inside could cause a problem with finding seating.  Luckily Washington Square is not too far away and that would make a great place to eat your food :)\nWe ordered 3 dishes\n1. Meatball Platter: This came with their very large and filling, homemade MOUTHWATERING meatballs as well as a kind of italian flatbread.  The bread complimented the meatballs very well.  This dish is smothered in their signature meat sauce and my taste buds were exploding.  I really really enjoyed this dish.\n2. Gnocchi with sage and butter:  The gnocchi is so soft and bouncy and plump and just the perfect way gnocchi should taste.  The butter and sage gave it a very herb and floral taste, I personally enjoyed it very much whereas my boyfriend mentioned the flowery taste was a bit too much for him although he loved the texture of the gnocchi.  Will probably get a pesto sauce next time instead of the butter sage.\n  \n*note* that's the really nice thing about this place is that you can customize your pasta how you want it and put whatever sauce on it.\n\n3. Pappardelle pasta w/bolognese sause: This was probably our favorite dish.  Their homemade pasta was so soft and bouncy and the sauce was very creamy and satisfying to the tast.  I loved how fat and wide pappardelle is and they really perfected the art of their pasta making skills.  \n\nI can't wait to come back and try more of their offerings =)  Will definitely tell others about this place!", "author": "Tori G."}

Even though I had actually started at a bakery for pastries, and then gone for truffles, I was still hungry for real food beyond desserts. It's an unassuming joint and looked quick, so I wandered in to the small space with a few tables, and walked up to the counter to look at the menu board and order.\n\nOver and over again I talk about how I love small, specific spots that fill a very small niche. I know it may not be en vogue to have a small menu, but I'd rather you stay in your wheelhouse and nail it, then have a super wide menu that tries too hard to please everyone.\n\nPasta is their game, and they stick to it. Pick your homemade noodle, pick your sauce, add a few bells and whistles if you like, but that's about it. Oh and something called a gnocchi roll, which looks intriguing. But they don't go out of control, and that's what I liked.\n\nI ordered tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce and only waited about 10 minutes, which they actually apologized for being too long. They were incredibly kind, especially as I had just wandered in without doing much research and wasn't sure what to expect. They smiled a lot, and made sure I felt comfortable. That goes a long way.\n\nIt's not fancy inside; the humble interior and homemade feel of things--even the signage--drives home the point that you are getting passion on the plate and not a pre-fab five course meal.\n\nThe pasta came out piping hot. I do love tagliatelle and it's served al dente (which is unexpected for a fresh pasta) but there were a few noodles that didn't get separated from each other and did cause some sticking. I'm not mad, as I like the chew of those stacks, but not everyone does. The Bolognese sauce was meaty enough to convey the carnivorous nature without weighing me down. I didn't feel like it was an overwhelming amount of food, but it's a nice, reasonable lunch.\n\nI sat there for a while as I was eating, at the bar that faces out the window onto Columbus. What a gorgeous street. What a busy, happening place. What a perfect place to slow down, and take it all in. It's so much of what I love about San Francisco--the people, the buzz, the noise, the smells, and most of all, the possibilities. I sat here and imagined coming back to this very block, time and time again. Getting chocolates, then wandering around in an infinite amount of adventures. Trying all the foods, and letting the city take us where it wants. \n\nI imagined the next time I'll be here--it may not be until next year--but what will that be like? Where will I go? Who will come with me for truffles and pastries and homemade pasta, or where will we decide to go instead? In five years, in ten years, as shops open and close, there are infinite adventures to be had. \n\nI sat and thought about all of this, and before I knew it, my tagliatelle was gone. I cleared my plate, took a deep breath, and once again opened to door back out to the street and all the opportunities that were about to present themselves once again.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I adore pesto, so I was excited. The dish is a hefty portion. I actually made about four small meals / snacks out of it. I liked the flavor of the pesto, but I found the noodles a touch too hard. Almost like they were a little under. Not sure if this is true al dente (since I'm not a pasta expert), but I like my pasta a little softer. I do wish they had the option to add a protein to their pastas. This would have been great with some chicken or something similar. I think they only offer meatballs as an added option and I didn't think that would go with this.\n\nGood place to get your pasta on.

I've never been to Italy before, but I'm now left dreaming about their pesto sauce for hours after my meal. They have such a down-to-earth vibe for an Italian restaurant. You even get your meal on a paper plate, but a couple bites into my meal, I had no doubts I'd want to keep coming back again and again. Here's what I ordered: \n\n- Ravioli w/ Spinach and Ricotta stuffed inside. \n- Pesto sauce, which is definitely worth a try if you're on the fence. \n- Burrata Salad which I most definitely just ordered for the Burrata. \n\nThe service is fairly efficient, but this isn't your usual Italian sit-down restaurant, so grab your cutleries when you order and wait for someone to call out your name with your food.", "author": "Gouthaman K."}

Very few of them are the 'real deal' - Italian homemade is the real deal. A great variety of homemade pastas (ravioli, tortellini, linguini), homemade meatballs, and some of the best pesto in the city. The pasta is a great portion and very reasonably priced. Would have loved a house bottle of red wine - but they don't serve beer or wine.\n\nAll of the employees looked to be in a good mood and seemed straight from Italy! My girlfriend was worried that we would upset them because we arrived at 8:30 and they close at 9:00 (she worked in the restaurant industry and has PTSD from teenagers showing up 5 minutes before close), but with the timely manner in which you order and they cook the fresh pasta - we walked out before 9:00!

No worries, just release it into the Casper mattress. Even though it's memory foam, I'm sure it wouldn't be a traumatizing memory.

You can find my review of the orgy-level oil drenched meatballs on that locations yelp page.\n\nThis time, I ordered cacio e pepe and was thoroughly disappointed. Cacio e pepe is a classic Roman dish consisting of like three ingredients - pasta, cheese (usually a mix of pecarino and Parm) and pepper. Legit one of the TWO WORDS in the name is pepe which means pepper. Which doesn't explain the fact that there's like probably two turns of a tiny pepper shaker on top of the dish. The trademark flavor of cacio e pepe is the abundance of pepper pockmarked through the entre. \n\nThat's excuseable I guess - I could use some random pepper at the office to get a moderate punch (it's much better professionally done bc they fresh grind it to extract oils and put it through a seive). \n\nBUT one of the trademarks of Roman pastas similar to this (AL arrabiata, aglio e oilo, etc) is that there exists an emulsification between the starches added through the pasta water and the fats in the sauce, usually oil or cheese. This leads to a creamy/flowy sauce that clings to the noodles without concealing. \n\nUnfortunately, the pasta I got was not emulsified properly. There were just stringy bits of cheese all over the dish and it wasn't even consistent. When I dug my fork in and listen the entire block of pasta came up as one whole. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt  and say it split during delivery.... But it said that cacio e pepe was a caviar secret menu item.

Also very good. \nAlso, try their meatballs - super soft and literally melts in your mouth. \nAnd their tiramisu is also made fresh to order. Sooooo gooooddddd. I felt like I was eating pieces of clouds. \n\nI wish they served alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with our pasta would make it better!!

So if I saw the Italian Homemade Company I probably would have just walked right by and not given it a second thought. But one thing I do crave are..meatballs! And I'll say right off the bat that they have the BEST meatballs I've ever tasted. \n\nThe Italian Homemade Company is a cute little pasta shop where you order first and then sit down. They have a wide variety of different pasta, pasta sauces, sandwiches and even salads. My boyfriend loves pasta, so he ordered the tagliatelle pasta with the bolognese sauce. The pasta itself is ~$9 and the sauce was another ~$2. I ordered the meatball platter which came with 6 (giant) meatballs and Piadina flatbread ($12). After you order you can watch them make everything for you on the stove right behind the cashier. In the back you can even see them making fresh pasta! The portions are generous, my boyfriend and I ended up sharing the pasta and the meatballs which was the perfect meal! Even though I don't know much about pasta or eat it that often, I know that this was definitely the freshest pasta I've ever had and perfectly al dente! \n\nBut OMG, don't even get me started on the meatballs. 6 meatballs might not seem like a lot, but given how big these meatballs are, it's more than enough! I had to cut it up into six pieces and eat it that way. It comes with sauce and cheese on top as well as the flatbread drizzled with olive oil on the side. The Piadina flatbread was unlike anything I've ever had and my stomach is growling right now just thinking about dipping the flatbread into the meatball sauce. It was super thin and tasted dough-y - I know that sounds strange but trust me, it's good. \n\nService was fantastic and paired with the food, 5 stars all around! Me craving pasta might be a thing now ever since I discovered the Italian Homemade Company. 10/10 recommend!!", "author": "Cecille W."}

Call ahead to order for pickup as there will always be a line.

Exhausted after a roughly seven hour flight which included a 1 hour layover, I decided to order in instead upon checking into my room. \nMy meal consisted of the Parpadelle with Bolognese and meatballs and a  salad.\n\nThe salad which was more like a meal in itself, hence regular, was fresh, full of robust, plum tomatoes and carrots and all that good stuff. The dressing, an olive oil vinaigrette of sorts, I didn't too much care for, especially when I specifically requested Caesar dressing. I have tacky, unrefined tastebuds, I suppose. But, hey, I like what I like.\n\nThe pasta dish was good, but not exemplary. Nothing stood out about the the sauce. I've had the same and better elsewhere. I did, however enjoy the meatballs, themselves; they are huge, so you only need one or two. The restaurant's a bit pricey. But, one thing for sure is they do give you a nice portion for the money.

I guess that is what happens when you're a New Yorker in a new city and refuse to take Uber or Lyft everrrywhere.\n\nAnywho, immediately the vibe was super cozy. Red stools, Italian products filling the wall, and the amazing to watch pasta making machine! Plus, the chefs and their wicked wrist action in cooking up fresh pasta. I haven't been to Italy, but I wonder if this is the vibe they'd have at a hometown pasta restaurant there. \n\nWith an eclectic selection of euro music playing, a few friends and I went with the Vegetable Ravioli in Alfredo Sauce ^2, Pappardelle in Pastiaccata Sauce, & a $1.79 Meatball. I also was going to order the $1 half flatbread but alas forgotten in my excitement. \n\nPappardelle in Pastiaccata Sauce (~$13)\n- These noodles were some of the freshest I've tried, cooked perfectly al dente. Some a little stuck together, but alas I don't know if I minded so much because the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the noodles themselves was fantastic. \n- The Pastiacatta Sauce, or I ignorantly would call \"Pink Sauce\" is delicous, especially for someone who loves tasting multiple flavors I appreciate this option because you get the kick of tomato sauce with the creamy bechamel coming through\n\nVegetable Ravioli in Alfredo Sauce (~$12)\n- Such soft texture and a unique flavor\n- This is definitely a crowd favorite worth trying\n- I personally didn't order this because I wanted something a little more filling and I think I went with the right choice with the pappardelle as the quantity of it is much larger\n\nMeatball ($1.79)\n- Interestingly enough, the tomato sauce which came like a moat around the singular meatball in a small paper bowl was the MOST delicious of all the sauces.\n- As mentioned previously, I LOVE pink sauce (mixing tomato and Alfredo sauce), strangely enough the mixing of this sauce with the Alfredo was far superior to the Pastiacatta sauce, which already was fabulous\n\nTIPS: \n- The meatball is enormous, so if you're a tiny-ish human you can very well be full off of 1. (I was almost too greedy and ordered another but glad I didn't!) \n- Mix the tomato sauce + Alfredo sauce, brilliant flavors :)\n- If you're super hungry, go with the noodle options as opposed to the ravioli\n\nTL;DR\nService (3/5) - prompt & friendly, not too much if you know what I mean\nFood (4/5) - the food is the star \nAmbiance (4/5) - paper plates, eclectic music, & warm vibes\nValue (5/5) - Great value for the quality of food, love", "author": "Sara S."}

We had a bunch of other food ordered from different restaurants to have variety and I'm so glad we didn't put all our chips in this basket.\n\nI ordered the lasagna, tagliatelle pasta with pasticiatta sauce, meatballs, ravioli with white sauce and pesto. It was unanimous from all the guests, that with the exception of the ravioli in pesto sauce, everything was mediocre at best. It was so disappointing that all of the pasta was extremely mushy, nowhere near al dente. The ratio of pasticiatta sauce relative to the amount of pasta was off, not enough sauce - such that everyone just felt like they were eating bland pasta. The lasagna, which I was hoping to be the star, was a huge bust. The noodles barely held their form and the flavor was really bland. \n\nI was hugely disappointed, as we paid the most money for this food, and it was the least favored by everyone at the party and had the most leftover. When we went to pick up the food, I was looking around at the dishes people were eating and they looked really good and was excited, but upon opening our trays, we didn't see the same thing and probably didn't taste the same things.

The menu is your standard Italian fare with salads, sandwiches, pasta, lasagna etc. I generally avoid getting pasta to-go as it gets soggy and lumpy by the time you get home, so after going through the menu I decided to get the Meatballs with Piadina Flatbread ($11). I honestly did not know what \"Piadina\" was, but went with it keeping an open mind.\n\nI reached the restaurant (It's on Columbus just ahead of Washington Square) 20 minutes after ordering to find that my food was ready so I was on my way. I got a heavy container with the meatballs along with the flatbread that was neatly wrapped in a silver foil. There were 6 huge meatballs. I mean these were gigantic. Unfortunately they were frozen solid. The plastic fork broke into pieces without even making a dent in these. The meatballs had to have been taken out of a freezer and used without thawing them out first. I am not sure what these folks were thinking when they gave me frozen meatballs. Would I not notice? Would they thaw out on the way home? Well, No & No. I let them stand for an hour hoping that they would thaw out. What these needed was about 3-4 minutes in a microwave, as I did not have one, I could not do much except to safely confine them in the trash. The flatbread was thin with a light dusting of raw flour. It was not built to soak up the sauce that came with the meatballs but could be used like a spoon to scoop up the sauce to quench my hunger.\n \nPrice wise this dish was cheap for the location. Most of the pastas on the menu are around the $15 mark which is also a little less when compared to other Italian places in the area.

I love the fact that it's a low maintenance and seat yourself kind of restaurant.\n\nThe idea is you wait in line, pick your pasta, pick your sauce, and pick any sides. Sit yourself down and then wait for them to bring your your plate. I had high expectations for this place because my friends had hyped it up so much. I like the idea that you can mix and match and they also make the food right in front of you and you can watch. Also the pastas are handmade which adds an extra layer of authenticity and excitement. \n\nI opted for the tagliatelle pasta with the pastiacciata sauce which is basically a bolognese sauce with a hint of cream in it to make it creamier. The first plate that was presented to me was completely inedible! The pasta was SO tough, and severely undercooked. I wish they would test the noodles first before plating so as to avoid crushing expectations.  I normally never complain about food or have to return my plate and have them remake it but this time around it was just inedible. \n\nI asked them to remake it again. TAKE TWO. This time it was much better! The pasta was more cooked and al dente and the sauce was delicious with just the perfect amount of tomato to cream to meat.\n\nAll in all,  I love that everything truly is \"homemade\" here and also the fact that you wait on yourself.

Moreover, he had the audacity to mark my food as \"Delivered\" prior to even calling me about being late! \n\nI ordered the pappardelle with meat and bechamel sauce. As you can see from my picture, my pasta had nearly no visible sauce (and was stuck together and hardened because the delivery took so long). There was some sauce, but it was all stuck towards the bottom. The taste was pretty good, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that had the delivery not been messed up, or had I eaten in the restaurant, the food might've been pretty decent. \n\nI do like the price. The pappardelle + meat sauce was maybe $12, which is very affordable! Similar caliber restaurants in SF charge almost double that price for this dish. As such, I would be willing to give this place another try.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Let me say that I'm very picky with my Italian food especially since I grew up in italy. It's hard to find an Italian place where I feel it's worth going to, however, this place delivers fresh made pasta at a reasonable price.\n\nWe ended up getting pappardelle al pasticcio, and gnocchi al pasticcio.  This place is truly perfection, they cooked the pappardelle al dente, and the gnocchi melt in your mouth.  The pasta wasn't drowning in sauce as it should be. \n\nConcept wise it's genius,  pick your pasta, pick your sauce and voila!  They serve on recycled plates which is great for a fast bite and makes their business run smooth.  I would recommend this place over 90% of Italian places in little italy, this place it's the real deal but don't expect anything fancy.", "author": "Josh Giosue D."}

I kind of went overboard, getting a salad and pasta and a huge San Pellegrino.  Even with everything I had, the bill was very reasonable.  Seating was a little difficult to find, so I took a seat at the window.  They brought my salad and my tagliatelle to me, which saved me from going through the crowd.\n\nSo my opinion of the food: salad was generous and excellent, with grape tomatoes, those fancy kinds of lettuce and a light dressing.  The pasta was very fresh; you can taste the homemade even though the tagliatelle is a little chewier.  Their sauce actually reminded me of the sauces I had experienced in Italy.  A little less paste and a little less in general.  I like a little more sauce so next time I will order some extra.\n\nService - you place your order at the counter - and feel free to order in Italian, I think they will appreciate it.

The pasta was all stuck together, making a bunch of it not saucy since it wasn't mixed with the bolognese sauce. The temperature was almost kind of cold on the sides and sauce but a lot hotter where the fettuccine was clumped together. It's very mediocre for the price. The place is also small and crowded.

I've been making pasta since high school, and I'm very familiar with the texture of al dente. To my surprise, the pasta was a strange hard doughy texture I had never tasted before, without the chew/bite of pappardelle I've had elsewhere. The sauce was very bland as well, I kept having to add salt. The tomato sauce tasted, well, very tomatoe-y...low on herb flavor (with large chunks of herbs that I had to spit out). Lastly, the paper plates soaked up a lot of the sauce and gave it a cardboard-y flavor. This place may be a staple of North Beach, but I just can't fathom what other people are tasting to warrant the almost-5 star rating.\n\nService was wonderful, it's a very happening location, but honestly, I could not go back for the food.

When you enter, you first go up to the counter to place your order, then you just find a seat wherever you can. When your food is ready, they bring it over to you. I ordered the meat ravioli with white sauce (not Alfredo - they said it's similar to Alfredo sauce except there's no Parmesan cheese in it, but they'll put some on top). At first it didn't look like much food but there was raviolis hidden underneath and it turned out to be more food than I could finish. Great flavor but if you're looking for ravioli that is filled with a lot of meat, you're not going to get that. It was very lightly filled with meat and ricotta which was fine with me because if I wanted a lot of meat, I would've had a burger instead.

I noticed that most people who came in were picking up meals or pasta to cook at home.\n\nThere are 3-4 high cafe tables and about 8 window-facing seats but to be honest, all the seating was less-than-ideal. The high cafe table was very wobbly and the window seats we eventually moved to for stability are tightly arranged with small stools that you need to carefully balance on.\n\nI had the gnocchi and asked the woman at the register (they all appear to be family or at least good friends) which sauce she'd recommend. She said \"the pesto.\" It was terrific. \n\nMy little boy wanted the tortellini and the small bite I had, enveloped in delicious homemade Bolognese sauce, was fantastic. \n\nI forgot about the meatballs and ordered them after we began eating. I had a bite, letting my little boy finish the rest and left the second one for him to take for lunch the next day with dinner leftovers. \n\nThe meatball was delicious. You can tell they use a mix of beef, pork and likely veal to make a very savory meatball - which is a deal at $1.70 each!\n\nDinner for two with two bottles of water and a 20% tip was about $44.

Their counter is set up deli style with a few already made dishes like their well known lasagna cold cut meats, cheese and some desserts, but in the fridge is where you'll find the freshly homemade pasta to choose from. After picking out your noodles, you pick a sauce which their choices vary from marinara, Bolognese, meatball, white cream sauce, etc.\n\nI went with the tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce and my bf got fettuccini with the Bolognese/meatball sauce. After placing your order, you find a table and they bring out the food to you. The seating area are high tables with stools, a few seats along the window and a couple of outdoor seating right in front. It does feel a little cramped and I couldn't help but look at what my neighbors ordered...everything looked fresh and delicious!\n\nThey do serve the pasta on compostable/recyclable paper plates, which I honestly didn't mind too much. The only problem I see with that is that it absorbs so much of the sauce that it almost tears through, but luckily that didn't happen with either of us. Anyway, our food came out piping hot within 10-15 minutes. The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente and the serving was very generous. The sauce is a little tangier than I'm used to and not as creamy, but I still enjoyed it very much! The Bolognese/meatball only came with 2 small sized meatballs, but my bf was also pleased with his dish.\n\nFor 2 pasta plates and a can of pelligrino soda, our order came out to about $28. I don't mind that it wasn't a sit down restaurant, it's great for when you're craving good quality pasta but don't want to spend too much time at a restaurant.

I initially poo-poohed it since I made the faulty presumption that a new Italian deli couldn't possibly have anything new to add to North Beach. Besides which, anytime Jamie W. and I walked by on weekends, it was filled with hipsters who weren't looking to give up their turf. Well, we finally made it in this past Saturday when we found ourselves on the peckish side in the late afternoon around 4PM, a good time to come in and have a more relaxing meal here without the self-entitled stares of impatient tourists hovering relentlessly for tables. Now we could actually browse the grocery area, peruse the menu selections and speak with owner Mattia Cosmi.\n\nHe and his wife, co-owner Alice Romagnoli, come from Rimini on the edge of the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. As a result, the hearty-looking dishes reflect a more northern Italian influence with their specialty the piadine, a quesadilla-like flatbread sandwich which we will need to try on a future visit. But for us, we were magnetized by the fresh pasta selections in the warming tray. I was immediately drawn to the $11 Pappardelle with Pasticciata Sauce, an abundant plate of thick, velvety noodles prepared al dente as only Italians seem to know how to do. The pasticciata is a creamier version of a meaty Bolognese sauce with the addition of bechamel (photo: http://bit.ly/1JqBbpX). Mamma mia. Jamie went for the $12 Lasagna, another house specialty with a  similar combination of beef and pork Bolognese and bechamel sauces (photo: http://bit.ly/1STupdO).\n\nIt was quite a large slice, no complaints there, but you could tell it was from the warming tray because it didn't have quite that fresh-from-the-oven flavor we were hoping to experience. Alas, that isn't really a criticism since it wouldn't have been reasonable to expect individual portions prepared the same way the pasta was. As a chaser, we ordered a couple of the $1.70 Meatballs, savory spheres of carnivorous bliss indeed (photo: http://bit.ly/1ICiJ87). We'd definitely like to come back and try more of their home-style dishes, maybe take them to go to eat on a bench at Washington Square Park and close our eyes with thoughts of returning to Bologna where we had a wonderful food tour courtesy of our pal Alessandro. Look at me, quite the globetrotter, ain't I?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...pasta done right with other Emilia-Romagna specialties to try\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...informal space, crowded most of the time but worth the wait for the quality\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and informative\nTOTAL - 4 stars...them Yelpers steered me right this time...abbondanza!", "author": "Ed U."}

Now I'm a huge fan and I can't wait to come back to try everything else on the menu.\n\nService is friendly and the shop is a joy to dine in, whether you're alone or with friends.

This was June 12, we were in the Northbeach area after our tour of Alcatraz island. Our children had this  Italian resto in mind for late lunch and seemed determined to go only to that place. \n\nI am glad we did. My meat ravioli with pasticciata sauce was sooo delicious and satisfying. I found myself biting into pasta so al dente, and which burst with every bite into a savory creamy fusion of meat and cheese so satisfying I forgot I should have stopped midway to stay on diet, until only a few pieces of ravioli were left. Hahaha. Then I justified finishing off the rest by thinking of the thousands of steps I had taken during our island tour earlier and in order to get to that place. I also forgot that I had grunted under my breath upon arrival there and seeing the hard wooden stools we had to sit on around a long wooden table with sacks of what looked like flour underneath. \n\nThe layout of the place is the reason for the lack of a 5th star. It lent a homey unpretentious air to the place but at that time I felt it was a bit too lacking in comfort for my tired muscles.\n\nThe authentic feel to this place was heightened by the fact that the people behind the counter (we could see our meal being prepared) seemed too busy preparing our meals to exhibit much Italian warmth, but they were helpful and courteous enough. Polite but busy and earnestly working to give the packed room what it went there for. \n\nOverall a satisfying experience. A must try, indeed.", "author": "Ting D."}

I came in planning to get the pesto but the special looked tempting. I wasn't that hungry but I ended up eating the whole thing because it was that good. I went to Italy last year and this was as good as the best pasta I had on my entire trip. My friend got the tiramisu which was so good especially if your favorite part of the tiramisu is the cream. \n\nThe restaurant itself is extremely casual and had a counter where you walk up and order. Like the food comes on paper plates casual. There are several types of pasta and several types of sauce to chose from that you can combine. You can buy pasta by the pound to bring home if that's what you're about. There are about 6 2 person tables inside and a long table along the window with about 8 stools. When I got there, every spot was taken but the turnaround is pretty quick here. The food comes on paper plates. The people who worked there were nice and were speaking Italian, which I appreciated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-06", "description": "I am a fan!\nWhat's not to like.  An Italian restaurant/grocery store in North Beach?!\nSadly, there has been little innovation and change in the neighborhood with the renown Italian community that is the staple of this area.  Many of the old time places like U.S. Restaurant, New Pisa Restaurant, Panelli Brothers, and Washington Square Bar and Grill are long gone.  There is a smattering of similar old time places (North Beach Restaurant, Fior D'Italia, Molinari's), but nothing quite sexy or eye opening.  Tony's Pizza is probably the exception for this cuisine.  Then along came this place.\nAfter reading Cherlynn's sexy review (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg), I immediately bookmarked this place, but hadn't found time to try it.... until now.  While heading back to my office, I stopped here, scoring rock star parking right in front on a recent weekday afternoon.  About half of the tables were filled, mostly high top tables and stools. The hostess kindly directed me to the menu board.  \nMy order was for my lunch and a future dinner so here's what I tried:\n\nLunch\nClassica Piadiana (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RTWf2FN6_tuRV07NFVaGdg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Served cold, this Italian sandwich which crosses between a wrap and a quesadilla comprised of prosciutto di parma, Strachinno cheese, and arugula.  I heated up some soup in the office and devoured half of this (the photo shows half portion).  Nice change from eating a traditional sandwich.\n\nFuture dinner\nLasagna add two meatballs (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yNrv9KEFEb6RYPhh9TqNFg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Flavorful and meaty good, especially with the addition of those two meatballs for $1.70 each.  Wish there a bit more noodle to balance out the dish as the meat sauce and cheese dominated here.\n\nWhile watching them put dishes together, I couldn't help but admire how the chefs were precise in apportioning and preparing the foods.  Hoping to return to try their build-your-own pasta menu portion, especially their namesake raviolis.  There are salads, flatbread, and hot sandwiches besides what I tried.  \nThe only thing missing was someone from Italy walking up and saying, \"Just like mama used to make!\"", "author": "Mike C."}

This is more of a service problem than food. The food was decent and priced right.  The problem was when we placed our order. You go up to the counter to do this. My fianc\u00e9 and I both went up and ordered a dish each. The girl wrote down our orders.  15 minutes later my dish comes out but my fianc\u00e9s is nowhere to be seen.  Just thinking it was just taking longer we waited a little longer. Finally he went up to ask where his food was and they pulled up the ticket she entered into the computer and she only put my meal in.  They never apologized or anything and made us feel like it was our fault!! So by the time his food came out mine was pretty much finished. \n\nTip to staff: If there are two people together they are probably each getting a dish.  Please use your head and apologize for your mistake and make them feel like they would want to return even if there was a mistake.

The layers were made perfectly and each bite was the same. I highly highly highly recommend getting the meatball with it because it's a meatball duh! Not only that but you can tell it was homemade just like the lasagna. The meatball was so simply made but the flavors packed a powerful punch. It wasn't over seasoned or overcooked, it was perfect. \n\nMy boyfriend got the pesto gnocchi and oh my goodness... It was GREAT! The gnocchi itself tasted like a cloud. I was literally biting into a little cloud. It was so soft and it just melted in my mouth. I've never tried a gnocchi this well made before. It just had everything I expected from a gnocchi. However the pesto sauce was ok. Wasn't feeling it at all. I would have rather got a red sauce or a cream sauce with this. The pesto was just bland in my opinion. But the quality of gnocchi saves the sauce definitely. \n\nWe also ordered the flat bread, it was alright. Reminded me of a quesadilla without the cheese just the tortilla. However this bread would make a killer quesadilla!\n\nLove love love this place, I will be coming back for sure!! \n\nOnly thing I would recommend is to dine in and eat everything there because it's fresher they way.

The prices range a little over $10 for the most part. I ordered the parpadelle pasta with the meatballs in bolognese sauce, the pasta came out al dente, which i really like, and the meatballs were hard and don't fall apart (again, a good thing). My dish was just amazing. My friend ordered the vegetarian ravioli with marinara sauce and meatball side and he describes it as \"simply fabulous\". We both got parmesan cheese on it and it was a good amount.\n\nThe service was just as amazing as the food. The gentleman that helped us was very easygoing and pleasant. He brought us our food and replaced the crushed red pepper that we had for a new one. He also checked up on us to make sure everything was good.

We arrived a little after 10:30 and was warmly greeted by Alesandro.  Although I had my heart set on the gnocchi roll, we did ask for a recommendation for the piadine and went with his favorite, the classico.  \n\nGnocchi Roll - Gnocchi is usually not the item I would normally order at an Italian restaurant but knowing that it was freshly made gnocchi dough surrounding spinach and ricotta and sliced so you can make sure you have some of the sweet and tangy tomato sauce in each bite had me sold.  Like Rachael Ray, one of my pet peeves is having a small blob of sauce on top of naked pasta.  Every bite deserves to be enrobed in flavorful sauce.  \n\nClassico Piadine - You cannot go wrong with prosciutto and arugula. The flatbread is thinner than pizza crust so is therefore crunchy but strong enough to hold the ingredients even wrapped like a sandwich.  \n\nPrices run about $10-$12 each I believe for the gnocchi roll and piadine. \n\nThey also had pannetone, sweets including the Spelari nougot, and sauces straight from Italy.  We went with the fresh made pasta (squid ink fettucine and tagliatelle) that you can take to go which averages about $15 per lb with two servings of the ones we got coming in at about 1/2 a lb.  If you want more than a lb I am assuming of each, they do recommend  you calling it in.  Since fresh made pastas have egg in it, make sure you get it right before heading home and in a cooler as it is best kept frozen to avoid sticking.  Once home, put it directly in the freezer and cook within 10-12 days.\n\nCheck out my final product with the fresh Squid Ink Pasta - http://www.cookwithzee.blogspot.com/2015/01/squid-ink-fettucine.html\n\nFinal product with the fresh Tagliatelle - http://www.cookwithzee.blogspot.com/2015/02/sicilian-eggplant-and-pepper-ragu.html", "author": "Joyce Z."}

Said friend is an eater. I am talking \"I am a tall man with much hunger, whole pizza is a snack\" friend lol. Any who, my partner is a chef and he was really impressed by the quality and deliciousness of this pasta. So much so that we had this sneaky conversation about our leftovers\n\nHim: We can't tell Erik we hold the secret\nMe: Do you mean the secret to his stomach?\nHim: No. The secret to happiness\n\nYes my friends, this pasta is so good,  you hoard leftovers. My leftovers didn't even make it back to San Jose. It is also walking distance to Lombard St so you can walk that guilt off right away. Seriously, those hill leading up there are steeper than you think.  \n\nThe place itself is very quaint. Right at the cusp of little Italy and on Russian Hill, it is a small shop that also sells deli items. Do yourself a huge favor and buy some of their deli items so you don't anxiously plan your next trip. They have a lot of options and combos to choose from. I went with the butter and sage gnocchi. Sage always makes me feel bouigy haha. My dish was 10/10 fantastic. I was convinced the butter and sage was a cream sauce they concocted. But alas, it was just plain 'ol butter and sage. Yes, I know, I can hear my thunder thighs ripping through my jeans now. The gnocchi was among the best I have had yet if not the best. They were light and airy but still doughy without being too dense. My partner ordered fettucini with bolognese sauce and two meatballs. We were so drawn by the plates walking by this shop that we essentially forced ourselves to eat. It was definitely worth it to be potbellied after finding this place! Our plates were only $10-15 each which is a price that can't be beat even by Olive Garden. You know since this place actually makes their pasta in house.\n\nOn our second visit, it was really crowded. The line went out the door but they took the  business with grace and you didn't wait longer than 20 minutes to get your order in and have it in front of you.  The shop itself is small so it doesn't take much to get full. Don't let the long lines deceive you! They have sold out of gnocchi since my first visit which breaks my heart but other items are still a good alternative.  I like their young cashier. She is always really friendly and helpful which you can say about most of their employees. \n\nOne of the best highlights of this shop is that they have female cooks. Lots of them! SO you know these ladies got that sensational Italian cooking pizzazz  that makes your food taste like rainbows are flowing through you. Definitely recommend this spot. Indoor seating as well as outdoor. This place is good for casual dates. It might just seal the deal for some ;D\n\nParking is tough but you knew that already. Its SF lol.", "author": "Maria M."}

The cooks banter to each other in Italian and the open kitchen space allows full view of your meal being cooked.\n\nThe menu is very straightforward, and the cashier is always willing to give recommendations, which is a plus.  Everybody decided to try something from a different category, ordering lasagna, ravioli, piadina, and cassoni (this was mine).\n\nI had very little idea what a cassoni would be, which turned out to be tomatoes, tomato sauce and mozzarella wrapped up in pastry crust.  You might think of it as a giant over-glorified hot pocket (as I did when I first saw it), but the flavors that hit my mouth with the first bite made me speechless.  It was rich and savory, striking the perfect balance between tang of tomato and thick cheese.  It warmed me up like nothing else on that cold winters day.\nI tried half of a vegetarian piadina.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-10", "description": "A hot mess of authenticity!\n\nIt felt like I got to peek into an Italian family's kitchen, without being a creep. Carb-loading was the mission. Yelp was the driver. \n\nWe found this little nook of authentic Italian food, where two streets meet in the strangest acute angle. Parking looked sheepish, so I hopped out to snag a table while J parked the car, solid game plan!\n\nLittle did I know what I was in for. When I called to see how long the wait was, they said less than 20 minutes. Thus, leaving the impression it was a full on restaurant. However, when you walk in, you immediately realize this is more like a deli. You get whatever seat(s) you can, hold onto them for dear life, then figure out how to order and not loose your seat.\n\n30 minutes later, J found a parking spot and he finally met me inside. I'd had plenty of time to give up my seat once and switch tables twice. I also had time to peruse the menu and peep all the food that everyone around me was eating. It is not fancy, by any means of the imagination. However, the food looked (because it was) fresh and homemade. Right above where the food is prepared and sitting, there are chalkboards as their menu. The kitchen is bustling with (I'm assuming) family members, screaming in a non-threatening (re: loving) Italian manner at one another. It really gives off a homey vibe.\n\nSince it was later in the evening, they had already run out of the pappardelle noddles. So I went with the tagliatelle with meat sauce and meat balls. J went with the meat ravioli with bolognese sauce. Although I applaud them for being green and using recycled styled paper plates, they weren't the sturdiest for their large servings. By the end of the meal, they were almost completely soaked through, but not quite enough to tear. The flavors of these dishes are what I'd expect to taste in Italy. The insanely fresh, al dente noodles. Sauce that's been brewing and simmering all day - mixed in spices and curating the amazing taste of their sauce. Their meatballs, huge in size, flavor, and quality of meat. The ravioli's were easily recognizable as homemade. Their little pockets of meat stuffed into their hand made outer shell, scalloped at the edges, were exactly what I'd imagine I'd be served at a little caf\u00e9.\n\nAlthough the setting did not transcend me to Italy, the flavors and dishes did. That and all the Italian being strewn about the kitchen. After I got over the actuality of the location, I loved it. You have to know what you're doing and getting yourself into here, but the food is well worth it.\n\nWe didn't order dessert, sadly. Or their piadine's, which have put them on the map in SF. I was stuck on carbs via noodles, so I stuck with what I love and know! We also enjoyed my beloved fruit San Pelligrino's as our beverages of choice, they had about five options to choose from. They have a serve yourself water jug, which we partook in as well. They also sell various Italian things, mostly food related, in their little shop. If I were to ever live in SF, which is never, I'd come grab take out before every race (or all the time). In all, it was delicious, light, and comforting as Italian food should be.\n\nCarb loading like a true San Franciscan!", "author": "Steph G."}

We checked Yelp for recommendations in the area (North Beach/Little Italy) and found a teeny, tiny little family market that serves up some wonderful stuff! \n\nThe place offered a selection of homemade, fresh pasta, deli meats, sauces, and desserts for carry-out or dine-in.  There was also a very nice selection of other items imported from Italy at extremely reasonable prices.  I picked up several packages of Black Trumpet and Chanterelle mushrooms, and both varieties were less than $10 per package.  The mushrooms were one of the few things not imported from Italy, but were locally sourced from the Bay Area.  I also purchased several large chocolate bars flavored with orange zest (imported)...yum!  \n\nLacking decorations, the tiny restaurant area was unassuming and sparse.  Five or six high-top tables littered the store front for those who chose to dine-in.  Menu items were hand written on three chalk boards, hung over the kitchen area, and you placed your order before grabbing one of the few available tables.  A short time later, your completed dish is served up piping hot in a disposable, cardboard container.\n\nI ordered pappardelle with bolognese sauce and an additional meatball.  The house-made pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente, and had a wonderful chew.  The rich, savory sauce was filled with tender meat, and the slightly acidic tomatoes were tamed with just a touch of cream.  But the meatball...incredible!!  Literally the best meatball I've ever tasted! \n\nIf you're looking for a nicely decorated, sit-down place where servers take your order and deliver your food, keep walking!

Unfortunately most of the places I wanted to try are closed on Sunday, and while we all wanted to try Tony's, we didn't realize we should have put our name down 2 hours in advance. Our bad.\n\nSo now we were on the hunt for an Italian place with good reviews. Up came The Italian Homemade Company. We were a bit confused, but between the lowering temperatures and the rising temperament of the baby, we needed to get food then and there. While a market that makes its own pasta, they also do make some dishes in store - pasta with sauce, specialty pastas, and cassionis. \n\nI went with fettuccine with the pasticciata sauce. The pasta could have been a bit more tender, and next time I'll stick with just the bolognese sauce. A friend got one of the cassionis and that was really good.\n\nThe staff was really nice and helpful, the place has a nice charm, but for me, I would have taken the pasta to go (I'm a fan of homemade pink sauces and vodka sauces).\n\nThat said, when I got there, they were taking out a fresh lasagna from the oven.

Here he is annihilating his food upon arrival without a care in the world while I'm all self-conscious, making sure I take small bites and wiping the corners of my mouth afterwards. You know, pretending like I had manners. \n\nIf you come on the weekends, be prepared for North Beach food tour goers that frequent The Italian Homemade Company. They will watch as you savor every orgasmic bite.     \n\nThanks to Albertino M. for this awesome find. In the sea of North Beach overpriced, tourist traps is gem called The Italian Homemade Company that serves authentic, homestyle Italian cuisine. Even though there's seating, it's seemed more like a to-go place as food is served on paper plates. There's dog-friendly outdoor seating but there's too much commotion in the area that I wouldn't bring Tater Tot. On the menu are fresh, housemade pastas, piadas (Italian flatbread), and cassones (Italian sandwich). Pick your pasta (pappardelle, fettuccine, gnocchi, tagliatelle, squid ink, ravioli, etc.) and then your sauce (bolognese, pasticciata, meatballs, pesto, marinara, white, butter & sage). They also have a gnocchi roll, meat and vegetarian lasagna, imported meats, and cheeses. Everything is about $9-$13, and portions are massive. Order at the counter and one of the friendly staff will bring your order to you. Cc's accepted.\n\nWe shared the Meat Lasagna ($12) and added two meatballs ($1.70 each): http://bit.ly/1LeSZDs. Now this is what I call some good 'ol rustic Italian cuisine. The lasagna had multiple melt in yo mouth layers filled with meaty bolognese sauce that had a wonderful depth of flavor. I prefer my noodles a little more al-dente but there's no denying this was one hearty, comforting dish. The meatballs were deliciously plump, tender, and very flavorful. All we needed was some bread to slop up some of that sauce. \n\nI wish all firsts can be as good as I sunk my teeth into my very first Cassone ($10): http://bit.ly/1JfAmuE. This unassuming Italian sandwich, hot pocket, or whatever you call it was amazing! A large piece of flatbread is filled with mashed potatoes, sausage, cheese, AND bacon, folded in half, and griddled until both sides are golden brown. It's served with a side of b\u00e9chamel sauce.

I'll just get straight to the point. \n\nMy favorite dish: the meat ravioli with sage and butter sauce. The ravioli has this nice chewy texture, which really is why this place gets 5 stars from me! Every time I go to Italian restaurants, the pasta is subpar because it all dissolves or tastes like people bought it from a generic brand and boiled it. The meat inside is blended so that it's almost this fine paste. The sage is a nice contrast to the meat by adding an earthy flavor. I would like to have more but they usually just give a couple of leaves. \n\nThis time I got the meat ravioli with a red sauce (the one also mixed with the white sauce), and I think I prefer the sage and butter sauce. My brother got the tagliatelle with the same sauce. I just can't believe how good his dish (the pasta in particular) was! He took a bite and was stunned by how amazing the texture was, especially in contrast to the warm, freshly made sauce. \n\nNext time, I plan on buying some pasta so that I can make it at home and maybe experiment with my own sauces!

It was super enticing but we ended up across the street at that sushi place because he did not feel Italian that day. Ever since I learned that he lived, for the most part, at his other place on 7th and Clement, and had a whole other life that I was not aware of, I had declared that 7th and Clement and it's immediate vicinity to be my no-fly zone. Alas, rules like such were made to be bend. From time to time, I continue to hover there, as T lived there too, and we were often out and about, doing our usual official food business. \n\nBut I prefer North Beach more. Yet that day, I was not here with B.  I was here to meet with a girlfriend of mine. And she's going to bring her new boyfriend. As I waited, I ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich based on the waitstaff's recommendation. The sandwich was served on a thin flat bread. Super delicious. Mouth watering. And the prosciutto was fresh. \n\nI told the waitstaff that I'm sure that my friends who are coming to meet here, would order something here too. You see, she was super sweet. She served my sandwich warm. Already cut up, half in a to-go box and half on a plate. A fast food with superb service. So considerate.\n\nThe girlfriend arrived with her new beau in tow. He was very intrigued about everything that was being served around us. A man arrived later than they, had gone up to the counter to order a gnocchi roll. I recall the waitstaff telling me that was good too but it sounded so unusual at the time. We watched the gnocchi roll being served to that man who ordered it.  The gnocchi roll looked like lasagna. But the pasta was made of potato starch. The sauce was rich and flavorful. You could smell the aroma from a few tables down. The girlfriend's beau went to the counter and ordered a gnocchi roll as well.  For a mostly to-go food place the food was all made to order. Thus patience is required. While waiting, I learned that my girlfriend had moved into her beau's house in Inner Richmond, and they were settling down. I happen to be eating out there a lot so I offered them my opinion on the different Burmese places that were around their hood, and how Burmese food has its regional varieties given the influence from neighboring countries. They seemed impressed with my in-depth analysis of a series of Burmese restaurants in their hood, or they were just  extremely polite. Just then the food arrived. \n\nI eyed their food jealously. Then I went to the counter and ordered one to go. It really could feed a family of four. Tried and true. Totally worth the wait.\n\nTime to head out. Hugs all around. I liked my girlfriend's new beau. As we waved goodbyes,  the beau turned around and said to me, \"You really should come to visit us. We MUST go out to eat. Or grab coffee. You can always find me at Village Market.\" He added.   \n\n\"Sure!\" \"Where do you guys live?\" I came to immediately regret my follow up question. \n\n\"7th and Clement.\" He cheerfully replied.", "author": "Victoria E."}

It's a quaint deli with amazing staff, who you can hear conversing in smooth Italian as the scent of tomatoes wafts from the kitchen. It's pick your own pasta and sauce, but I didn't have enough confidence that I would ace the combination first try. Instead, I played it safe with the lasagna, topping it off with a meatball. \n\nThe portion size is HUGE- for someone like me who could eat lasagne all day, it was very sizeable and I couldn't even finish! Pasta was soft and would not have been heavy if not for the meat sauce. In the end, the bolognese sauce on the lasagna proved to be rather salty for my taste and had me reaching for multiple cups of water before I was done. \n\nKudos to the folks who made the pasta, though! It was very well cooked and didn't feel like a brick in your stomach, unlike other lasagne I've tasted. However, the real highlight of my lunch here was the meatball.\n\nIt was an absolutely divine meatball. The texture was amazing, and the meat itself was delicious and flavorful. I would recommend these meatballs to anyone; spending $1.70 on one of this place's spheres of meaty goodness is well worth it!\n\nI will return for more helpings of meatballs, if not to try my hand at \"build-your-own-pasta\".", "author": "Chanun O."}

The shop itself is really cute, with a few italian guys working there (all talking in italian to each other). It has a menu to eat-in. For to-go fresh pasta for cooking, you need to tell the counter how much you want for each kind and they'll grab it for you. \n\nI got the pasta (not cooked) to go: squid ink pasta, gnocci, and veggie ravioli. They are very fresh and tasty. They recommend freezing the pasta even if you're going to eat it in a day or two. I had it 3 days after and it tasted very fresh and al dente. \n\nI saw them cooking there - it looked very good, but the sauces seem to be on the heavier side.

I felt like I had made a good choice.\n\nWe ordered cassones, which are basically stuffed sandwiches that resemble calzones. Mine had meatballs and mozzarella, with bolognese sauce on top. It's the best Italian thing I've ever eaten. My fiance's was a breakfast version, which was also top-notch. I saw that lasagna out of the corner of my eye and was tempted to just start ordering everything and think of the consequences later.\n\nWhile we were eating at the counter, we noticed the restaurant was suddenly a part of a food tour. Nice. That was the last step in realizing we had stumbled into somewhere pretty special. \n\nThe Italian Homemade Company seems too cute and perfect to also have the best food ever.

There's a lot of pastas and sauces to choose from and, like the name would imply, they are all homemade. The Italian Homemade Company was started by a bunch of Italian friends who just wanted to open a delicious Italian restaurant and the love and care shows. All the pasta noodles are delicious and the restaurant itself has a very homey feel to it, with all the floating shelves and jars of sauces scattered about. The italian music adds a nice vibe to the whole place as well.\n\nI've been there twice now and have tasted firsthand the linguini noodles with meatball sauce. DELICIOUS. My friend got the linguini noodles too, but with pesto sauce. The pesto was a bit bland but the noodles made up for it. Another one of my friends got elk ravioli. How cool is that?! She took it to-go for lunch so I don't know how she found it but I'm sure it was delicious. \n\nStop by this place, help yourselves to some pasta, and welcome these guys to the North Beach's restaurant world!", "author": "Philip W."}

We came here thinking we were going to get authentic homemade but didn't didn't like the taste of the pasta at all. We should have just ate at home using barilla pasta which would have tasted much better. I have had authentic homemade pastas at other restaurants which tasted absolutely delicious so I thought we would give this place a try. Also the cashier was very rude. One member of our party has certain food allergies when we questioned if the ingredient he's allergic to is in our dishes the cashier had an attitude and responded very rudely.

I have zero complaints about the actual meal, it was honestly very good. I've been to the other location in the Marina and had a delightful experience, so the experience I had this evening was quite surprising and disappointing. \n\nWe ordered two orders of \"gnocchi and red sauce with meatballs,\" - perhaps I used the wrong verbiage to describe what I wanted? Fair. But what ensued is by most standards pretty unacceptable in terms of food service/customer service/being a polite human being. \n\nAbout 30 mins after ordering, our food arrived, but with no meatballs. When we told the chef who had served our food that we ordered meatballs, she argued with us! Mind you, we weren't being rude or dismissive. She scrutinized our ticket and continued to tell us that we didn't order meatballs (customer service tip: if the customer says \"I ordered x,\" say \"no problem\" and adjust accordingly... Don't argue with or disparage a customer). \n\nSeveral more minutes go by while they remake our order (would've been quite happy with just a side of meatballs, but whatever) - the cashier who took the order initially comes out with the plates, and we enthusiastically thanked him. \n\nHe began to say, \"by the way, I remember you,\" and I assumed he would've said \"I remember you ordered meatballs.\" I didn't expect nor want an apology, I assumed it was a simple mistake. Not a big deal at ALL. But he, too, argued and proceeded to tell me off for ordering incorrectly... And I was really just so uncomfortable and awkward because the rudeness caught me off guard and I hate confrontation. It was so bizarre (customer service tip 2: don't disparage a customer twice in a row at their table). \n\nBtw, I had left approximately a $6 tip (over 20%) on the order, which is pretty hefty for a fast-casual restaurant, AND I think I was pretty darn kind in all my interactions - extra friendly, if you will. \n\nTL;DR - food is wonderful but had an alarmingly rude and unfriendly customer service experience.

I don't like to write negative reviews, but this was pretty bad.  First of all, be prepared to wait in the same line as everyone else who is ordering their food.  There was only one register and other workers milling about chit chatting while the person manning the register is busting her butt.  When I asked if I had to wait in line, even though my food is ready, they said yes.  \n\n  I ordered lasagna with extra meatballs, mozzarella salad, and gnocci roll.  The gnocci roll and salad were delicious, which is why I give this 2 stars.  Now the bad part - They forgot to include the meatballs that I ordered.  I asked to get them delivered, but all they could do was credit me back the difference.  That doesn't help me as I'm still hungry.  The lasagna would have been delicious as well, if it wasn't so salty.  It was salty to the point of being inedible.  I asked for them to deliver a new one.  They refused to do anything to help me because this dish is their \"best seller\".   Essentially, they didn't believe that the chef over salted the dish and wouldn't do anything about it.  \n\nThis place would have been a winner, except for the horrible service.

The fragrances and the atmosphere are so Italian, and the charming chefs are singing and speaking in their native language. Not only do they have freshly prepared food, they also have handmade pasta you can take home to make yourself.\n\nBased on a friend's recommendation, I tried the clasico piadino. A piadina is basically a flatbread sandwich, and they make their yeast-free flatbread fresh daily. I literally watch them grill my flatbread from raw dough into a chewy bread and then layer it inside with mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. It was so simple, but so perfectly executed with the freshest of ingredients and preparation. My boyfriend had the lasagna, which had just the right ratios of pasta to sauce to meat. I've never been that into lasagna, but this one was amazing. We decided at the end to try one of their bombolinis, which is an Italian filled donut. It was honestly one of the best fried donuts I've had, with an extremely aromatic dough and the best chewiness. There wasn't an overload of jam- it was just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.

This is less a restaurant, in the traditional sense, as it is a self-service eatery. There are about 4-5 high-tops with chairs scattered about where you eat. You order at the register and the food is brought to your \"table\" on paper plates. I was hoping for the sausage and peppers, but they were sold out, so I had the fettuccine with bolognese sauce and two meatballs. My wife had the same but with marinara sauce.\n\nThe pasta is freshly made, but a bit doughy for my taste. I wish it had been rolled a bit thinner. There were also clumps of pasta stuck together in my plate that usually indicate that the dough was too moist when it went through the rollers on the pasta maker.\n\nThe sauce was tasty but not complex. It required a bit of salt and red pepper flakes to really make the flavor pop. The meatballs were good but far from the best I've ever tasted.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful and the staff was clearly out to please their customers.\n\nI might consider this restaurant if I were a local, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it again.

We arrived around 6:30 and am glad we did because by 7pm, there was a line forming (closes at 8pm). \n\nBig menu but pretty simple items. We ordered:\n1. Gnocchi roll - you MUST get this! Such a unique and delicious dish. Basically like a gnocchi filling wrapper inside this soft bread roll, with marinara sauce. So so good and big service sizes!\n2. Fettuccine pasta with pesto - simple and probably my least favorite out of the three things we got, but only because we didn't see the crushed red pepper / condiments table so it tasted a little bland. But the fettuccine tasted extremely fresh and I liked that the pesto wasn't too oily.\n3. Burrata salad - Definitely recommend this one. The burrata serving is generous and comes with balsamic vinegar, grape tomatoes and salad. Good healthy addition to an otherwise rich / heavy meal. \n\nTips / Comments:\n+Arrive early to snag seats at dinner\n+Sit inside and explore - cute trinkets, sauces, baguettes and they even sell boxed pasta! \n+Get the gnocchi, but also explore some of their other pastas (which I wish I did in hindsight), like the fresh ravioli or the sandwiches! \n+Amazing staff - we got checked on twice and the staff was extremely friendly / helpful\n+Great music (no background, boring music) - lots of 90s / rock, loved it", "author": "Anu P."}

It might be easy to miss since it's a bit north of center in Little Italy, and its interior consists of an open kitchen and several small bar seats and tables. The portions look small at first, served on an ordinary paper plate, but a plateful of pasta and a meatball was definitely filling. We got Tagliatelle and Pappardelle with Bolognese sauce, and the pasta texture was very on point and al dente. It was also the hottest pasta I have ever had, and it maintained that temperature throughout the meal by means of which I can't explain, since most pastas go cold relatively quickly. Their bolognese sauce actually has large chunks of good meat mixed in already, not the usual bits and pieces you'd find elsewhere.

I was terrified.\nLuckily, the Italian Homemade Company, is nothing like that. \nWe got in and it felt like we were on a beach town in the Adriatic Coast. Ok, that's an exxageration, but pretty close! It helps that they have classic (cheesy) italian music from the 60's/70's/80's and all of the people working there are italians!\nI was advised to try a \"classic\" piadina.

First of all, I ordered the lasagna which I saw was already baked(cooked?) and put in a warmer. By the looks of things, the lid was left off and the lasagna was just sitting there for who knows how long  That lasagna was then put into a pan and re-cooked/heated and put in my to-go box. There's nothing wrong with preparing food the way they do, but I am a stickler when it comes to Italian food which I believe should be freshly prepared; especially if the name of the place contains \"homemade\".

I've lived in Italy and this restaurant is the real deal. The employees are all really friendly and easy on the eyes too ;) but more importantly the food is incredible! The lasagne is to die for and you can understand why such a small sized place gets the amount of customers it has. It's very unique and true to Italian culture - even how you can buy fresh pasta by the pound and cook it at home. The tiramisu is no joke as well and the portions are an ideal size too. If you're near Russian hill then definitely check it out. Amazing! Grazie Mille!!!", "author": "Ana A."}

The Gnocchi Roll is absolutely amazing, wonderful texture, fully warm all throughout, and with a perfect ratio of gnocchi to ricotta / spinach that I have yet to have topped.\n\nThe second dish I would highly recommend is the Pasta Bolognese, once again another very authentic Italian dish that makes my mouth water every time I even think about it. The noodles are done the traditional Italian way, al dente, the sauce isn't overbearing or too much, and the meat blends in very well with the dish. It's perfect.\n\nThe restaurant itself feels like a deli or cafe, so it appears more traditional and it has limited seating, so prepare yourself if you're going to drop in.

Already salivating, you examine the menu only to be overwhelmed by your desire to order everything, but you realize you don't know what half the menu means. You can order items you obviously were dead set on getting, but what if this Piadina/Cassoni thing is better and you just don't know!? You watch the cook douse a huge block of lasagna in a beautiful red sauce, then your eyes dart to the back kitchen where someone is actually rolling out pasta, then you see the trays of Cassonis and you're still just as undecisive as ever. A friendly voice chimes in like a lifeline as you struggle in well of gluttonous anxiety...he coolly answers all questions in a friggin cool accent and offers his recommendations...you're saved...\n\nAfter chowing down on hearty portions of lasagna and stuffed gnocchi, I knew that I found my new go-to spot in North Beach.

And I have been missing it very much! \n\nSo, last Sunday I BARTed over montgomery st from the Mission and walked through chinatown just to go and try a nice piadina: totaly worth! You must try it!!!\n\nPiadina, Cassoni and freshly made pasta. If you are Italian you will love it.

They recently opened end of August and I already have made multiple visits. I formed an addiction of their cassoni, ravioli, lasagne, piadina, and gnocchi...I can go on, basically everything they make, as it's freshly made and delicious. And if you never had a cassoni or piadina then you haven't lived!! You can order to eat there, takes like 5 minutes or quickly grab some fresh handmade pasta and sauces home to cook. The owners are an amazing couple and are passionate in what they do. When I'm looking for traditional italian food, this is the spot. Other restaurants over do it sometimes with too heavy oils or sauces but at the Italian Homemade Company they make it perfectly, just like when I was in Italy. 5- stars for sure!!! Oh yeah, also they sell tasty treats and chocolates from Italy. Buono!!!", "author": "Nicole B."}

Check it out and support a local business.\n\nSo glad to have a new italian delicatessen on this side of North Beach.  The owners built out the store themselves and the wife is the chef.  The menu was limited given it's their first weekend but what I got was delicious.\n\nThey have 'cassoni' sandwiches which are a lighter version of calzones.  They make the flatbread to order and you can choose your own fillings or order a pre-made one.  Yesterday, we tried one which had mozzarella , cherry tomatoes and arugula inside of it - delicious as the tomatoes were sweet, the cheese was warm and oozy and the bread slightly crispy.  Today we had mild italian sausage, stuffed peppers and mozzarella which was the perfect combination of salty, sweet and cheesy.  The other choices for filling was one that had meat inside and another that had potatoes and spinach.  They also had lasagne and stuffed veggies.\n\nWe also bought raw flatbread dough and my husband made delicious pizzas out of them tonight.\n\nThere's some seating - more like a sandwich counter.  You can also get dry goods from Italy - pasta, sauces, cookies, Baci.\n\nThe real attraction will likely be the fresh pasta they make every day.  There wasn't much left by the time we visited in late afternoon so we plan to try again another day.", "author": "Serena S."}

This place is awful.Don't be misled by some of the photos! We were looking forward to having lunch here. Never again. How can Italian Homemade even look people in the eye? Maybe the pasta is made there but mine was soggy. Had the tagliatelle pasta with marinara and husband had the meatball flatbread. Disappointed! The sauce is from a jar and tastes terrible. The gal at the counter seemed initially nice, but when I asked about the sauce, she sneered and said, \"you are an american and this is how it's made in Italy... You are not used to good sauce and pasta in America.\"  Ok, I've been to Italy and the sauce/ pasta is fantastic. It is anything but what this place offers. My husband said his sandwich was \"bleah.\" I did not finish, because it was inedible. One kid sitting near us kept telling his parents that his flatbread sandwich was awful. Parents did not look happy with their dishes either.

The Ravioli's are soft, full of flavor and are definitely addictive.  I have been here around 5 times and never disappointed.  The place is casual but very nice.

This place definitely didn't disappoint - it looks very unassuming from the outside, but the quality and taste of the food is up to par, very authentic, and you can tell that they put a lot of time and care into everything made there. The interior and set-up reminds me of something you would actually find in Europe - very homey, casual, and cozy. This is the type of place where you can grab a quick bite and eat at the small round tables they have set up inside with a small group of friends, or order there and take it to-go, like we did. They also have freshly made, frozen pasta that you can buy and make at home too.\n\nI got the gnocchi roll, which was unique and like nothing I'd ever had or heard of before. It was denser than my friend's gnocchi (which was literally like eating a pillow - amazing!) and it was rolled in a pin wheel shape, stuffed with spinach and ricotta, and then cooked in marinara sauce. One of my friends got the gnocchi with pesto, and the other got the pappardelle special, which was essentially in a carbonara sauce. Everything was delicious, and was not overly heavy or salty, which is one of my biggest pet peeves with food in general. I'd much rather have something bland than overly salty any day. Italian food also usually leaves me feeling gross after, no matter how good it is, but I didn't get this with their food which was an unexpected plus. The service there is also prompt and friendly, and the cooks and workers seem to have a family-like feel.

The tortellini were great as were the ravioli both meat and spinach ricotta, the meatballs were heavenly, and the gnocchi rolls were almost mind altering. Portion sizes were perfect it didn't look like much, but I left feeling full and energetic. The selection of drinks left something to be desired, and I didn't spot the fresh breads until after I had finished my meal.

My son asks for some forks and since their fork bucket was empty. He got a bunch out and dropped some and put some of them in the container and give a couple to my son.  The lasagna that we got had a least five 1.5 to 2\" strands of hair.  Wouldn't mind the price if they know at least to not give us forks that. Came from the ground.  Worst part is he looked to see if my son saw him picked it up from the floor. I was watching my son and him the whole time.  And well of course the hair.  That was pretty disgusting.

We were welcomed warmly and choose our dishes. The employees' Italian accents were charming and it was easy to tell it was authentic from their conversations among themselves while cooking. Apparently that night they had a big take-out order so they apologized for \"making us wait.\" In reality, the wait was less than most other restaurants I've been too (and the food was made totally fresh because we could see them cook it in front of us). The ambience is charming and the music great. When we got our food, we were all incredibly impressed. It was simple, but delicious and I could taste every scrumptiously fresh ingredient. When one of the cooks came to check on us, he noticed that my girlfriend had not eaten the bread on her sandwich. When he learned that she couldn't eat gluten, he immediately volunteered to make a batch of special gluten-free pasta that they had just made fresh the past week FOR FREE. He was incredibly sweet and just wanted to make everyone happy regardless of the extra work or cost for the restaurant. \n\nOverall, this was an incredible experience. We even came back the next day for lunch and it was just as good. Overwhelming recommend this gem.

She actually remembered what I ordered the previous night. She said it was just because it was a slow night, I think it is because I am such a handsome fellow from Wisconsin haha. Great food and great service. I will have another Gnocchi roll before I leave town.", "author": "Chad T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-13", "description": "I had some pasta with bolegnese sauce and meatballs. Those meatballs were the best I've had, not that I've had a lot. The pasta and sauce were above average too. It took a little while to get your food but it was worth the wait. The pasta by itself is a little expensive, $11-$14 a pound fresh. The plates ran about $15 with tip. Its not too bad but it is just a deli. I dont like paying restaurant prices for a deli.", "author": "Eden R."}

Not only was it amazing homemade Italian food, but the store is owned by two of the nicest business owners you will ever meet. It felt great to support a locally owned business in San Francisco that is creating a great product.", "author": "Doug B."}

This place is soooooo good!   When I come here it reminds me of Italy!   I wish I could come every day.  The pasta is fresh made in the back and just so delicious!  I love that this is more like a mom and pop place, but also that you can feel the love and passion that goes into the food.   The owners are a newlywed Italian couple who are very friendly and everything is so delicious.   So far I've had the Piadine yesterday and liked it so much I returned today to have a cassone.  My husband is having the Ravioli with bolognese tonight and had parpadelle with pesto yesterday.   I'm so excited because everything tastes sooooo good!  The owners even come out and check how you are doing and gave my husband more meatballs too.   So happy to have found this place!", "author": "Lily L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-03", "description": "Yea sure this place has that contrived Italian mom and pop local shop look and feel but that doesn't sway my opinion on the food. I ordered the fettachinni with pasta sauce and I felt the sauce was too salty and the pasta portions a bit skimpy. I also deducted points for the overly generous ratings all the family members and friends gave this place. No way is this a 5 star rated restaurant (5 star rating at the time if my review).  They also kept their silverware next to the ordering line where people are sneezing waiting to order their food. The kicker was seeing mama mia coming out if the kitchen with the canned 'al denti' tomatoes. Yea and this restaurant is called 'homemade', sure. Sorry no sympathy points for coming from Italy and opening a restaurant in America. Should have brought your 'A' game.", "author": "Moe H."}

Since they have been open, I have tried everything: piadina, cassoni, lasagne, the stuffed veggies, but today was Meatball Tuesday...and I have to say their meatballs are hella good, like HELLA good! They make a sauce with peas and I never thought I liked peas until now. I had a gang of meatballs, sauce and piadina flat bread for 5 bucks. I felt like it was too good to be true. All of their ingredients and prepared food is overwhelmingly fresh. Do yourself a huge favor and enjoy their awesome food. This joint will get hipper by the day, so if you want to impress your friends, family and palate...get it while it's hottt! The lasagne is better than my mom's!!!*****", "author": "Paul S."}

I ordered their prosciutto sandwich and it was too salty (and I talk salt on everything). My husband ordered the ravioli and it was bland. My kids ordered the cheese calzone and they didn't like it. I read all the great yelp reviews and thought the food was going to be really good and authentic but I don't know what they're talking about. The service was not the best either. While trying to order our food, the wife kept interrupting and talking to her husband (in Italian). He apologized but she continued to interrupt.", "author": "Maria S."}
