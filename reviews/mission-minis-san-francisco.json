With the groupon you have to order in advance to make sure they have enough. I emailed them on a Wednesday for a Sunday pickup. And got a confirmation email back. But I arrived at the place on Sunday and the very nice lady couldn't find my order. So she offered to put together my order for me. I couldn't get my email up in time so I just got and assorted amount of whatever they had in the display case. I think I was missing one or two flavors that I requested that was on their website but wasn't available in their display case. Oh well. I then tried to pay with my groupon and she said oh, do you have a confirmation email and I had to bring it up and show it to her to prove that I did really try to pre-order the cupcakes. And she let me purchase it. Fiasco aside, the cupcakes were just ok. They are pretty small - like 2 bites each. I think the groupon is about 40-50% off and even with the groupon, it still seems pretty pricey for these small cupcakes. My favorites were the blueberries & creme and the cinnamon horchata. These were moist and had good flavor.  The rest were actually like of dry. Hopefully they were all freshly baked. Good location - located off the main strip of the mission with plenty of street parking. It's a small shop but plenty of room to grab cupcakes and go. I guess they also offer baking/cooking classes too because there was one going on in the back when I was there.", "author": "Alison W."}

TL;DR they aren't good with orders being ready on time and don't care if they're late. That's not a place worth spending your money IMO. \n\nI was asked to be the Godmother to my best friend's son. Since I'm an Atheist, I thought it was super sweet to include me and ordered 48 mini cupcakes to take to the baptism. I'm not only Atheist, I'm also paranoid. So I asked for the cupcakes to be ready at 10 AM on Saturday so they'd definitely be ready when I needed them at 11 AM to make it to Berkeley by 12 for the event. I even called to re-confirm my order and they assured me it was all set. \n\nThe day of, I was running late and arrived at Mission Minis at 11:10 AM. Guess what...my order wasn't ready! They said it would only be another '30 seconds' so I kept my mouth shut and stepped outside to keep an eye on my car (parked in front of a hydrant). After a few minutes I went back and they still weren't ready! So I asked how much longer as I was going to be late and was worried about getting a parking ticket. Without looking up at me, the woman behind the counter said they were almost ready.  Finally I said, 'this order was supposed to be ready at 10 AM.' The woman replied to me in the rudest, snarkiest voice and says, 'Well, we got backed up.' ie 'get over it cause we really don't care.' No sorry, no feeling bad on her part.

Very subtle lemon and cream cheese flavor. I wish it were a little more tart as I wasn't even sure if I was eating the lemon one. The cake itself was too moist and wet. I like my cake a little springy, but this ended up having a slightly mushy texture.\n\nI like the size of the cupcakes. Perfect for someone like me who doesn't like eating a whole dessert.

Friday night was Pink Zebra, Saturday was Hal Jr's at Mission Minis. Whomever thought that cupcakes and BBQ should go together is genius!\n\nPretty simple concept: Order at the counter and either shove that delicious food in your face right there. Or take it home to shove in your face from the comfort of your couch. We chose the latter, since BBQ can get pretty messy... that and we ordered one of everything, wanted to give the impression that there might be more people enjoying this huge pile of food.\n\nThe good: Ribs! Slow cooked and falling off the bone. Only one sauce to choose from and it was spicy! If you have an aversion to spicy things lay low on the sauce. Good BBQ doesn't need a lot of it anyway. Also the macaroni was quite good. Not usually a big fan of bread crumbs on top, but the creaminess of the cheese sauce gives way to just about anything.\n\nThe OK: Side of corn and sweet tea. Let me go on record saying I detest sweet tea in any form, so that's not completely fair. My +1 says it was just fine. Corn was cooked fine, tons of mayo, just not the best. Certainly better than anything KFC attempts though.\n\nOf course we got two Mission Minis to go as well, lemon and salted caramel. Those are always a treat. I love that they still cost only $1 in a city of overpriced cupcakes. Well played, guys.\n\nHope to see more pop up action out of this Mission bakery.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-03", "description": "I recall seeing part of an episode of Cupcake Wars sometime last year where Mission Mini's was the winner so when I saw a Groupon deal around Christmas time for 2 dozen I snapped it up. Of course, not thinking that I now live 65miles away and about how just myself and my Husband were going to eat 2 dozen. Damn, you Groupon and your impulse buys!\nPanic over when I was planning a trip to the City with Tram that luckily coincided with having friends coming to visit the following day, extra people to help us eat these cute little cakes.\n\nI placed an order 3 or 4 days in advance which was very quick and easy, I said I would be there to collect them between 4pm and 5pm that coming Saturday but as it turned out we were running a little late and didn't get there until almost 6pm. I made sure to call and let the staff know and was reassured that someone will be there until 8pm and not to hurry, upon arrival were greeted with smiles from he 2 young males working and was handed my 2 boxes of goodies.\n\nWith my order I requested 7 different flavors which were all present and before saying goodbye to Tram at the end of the day handed her the 3 extra Chocolate I ordered for her and her little one's enjoyment once home. I would like to say that I was good and didn't touch the Cupcakes until our friends came around the following day but that would be lying. After a rather disappointing Dinner my Husband and I tucked into a couple that evening: \n\n* Cinnamon  Horchata (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?filter_by_userid=True&select=uCdACqGfGhq5-DCpfe2MSA&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#6C9qFBPfKkM66ya8vNupeQ) - - Sooo good! Delicious Cinnamon flavor with creamy frosting.\n\n* Swiss Almond Coconut (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?select=a2lno5HNl9XyPQpDzAOAmQ#z-_2aq0RkaB2vtoefq4Tzw) - Not as impressed. The flavor of the sponge just didn't sit right with me, nor my Husband who said it tasted like soap..??\n\nThe rest we saved until the following day for our guests which went down well. The Cinnamon Horchata was the favorite by far followed by the Blueberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?select=a2lno5HNl9XyPQpDzAOAmQ#D-I9Dux_iwFr_NDLqEOCxQ) then the Double Chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?select=a2lno5HNl9XyPQpDzAOAmQ#XN7QK0i4jCpouetz8eHdlA\n\nThe other flavors were a bit of a hit or miss, a couple were a on the dry and chewy side, maybe my own fault as we waited a day to eat them? They were sealed in an airtight container though. Then a couple of them also had a sprinkling of granulated sugar on top of the frosting which isn't an appealing texture. \n\n*Peanut Butter Kiss (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?select=a2lno5HNl9XyPQpDzAOAmQ#lPcFCkVAz6tws0bNibG50g).\n\n* Ruby Red Velvet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?select=a2lno5HNl9XyPQpDzAOAmQ#3UstGo-66YDxjl8ua_nfBA).\n\n* Meyer Lemon Creme (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-minis-san-francisco?select=a2lno5HNl9XyPQpDzAOAmQ#YmekmGQPNDQhs5OTdfJh8w).\n\nFor $12 I think I got a great deal though as myself, Husband and friends got to sample a number of the flavors.  They are usually $1 each and take about 3 bites to devour one. The store is small inside with cases filled with the mini Cupcakes, however you can get regular sized ones for between $3 and $4 a piece if you place a custom order and they deliver!

The gluten free was a bit on the dry side (not awful but not the best I've had) but all the others - double chocolate, classic vanilla, pumpkin spice, peanut butter, meyer lemon - were fantastic. As some other reviews mentioned, the meyer lemon had a bit of a syrupy, sticky texture, but that's going to happen anytime you add lemon curd to something and it was a big hit with our group. \n\nThe only negative is that the delivery scheduling process was a bit odd. I needed the cupcakes for a 2:30pm party and was given very broad \"delivery windows\", one of which was too early and the other would be too late. So they were delivered at noon and I had to find a place to hide them for two hours. Not the end of the world but it did seem odd they couldn't narrow it down more than that.", "author": "D L."}

I'd never been to the place before so I just wanted to try a variety of whatever flavors they had available. \n\nShe responds as if I'm trying to cheat her or something. She say, \"yes the groupon says advance orders need 48 hrs notice, so you should have known that a 2doz order needs 48 hrs notice.\"\n\nAfter going back and forth on how in the world I was supposed to know that a \"2 doz order\" is the same as an \"advanced order\", she says \"If you had bought the 1 doz groupon it wouldn't have had that language about 48 hrs in advance. That's how you'd know.\" I told her I didn't buy the 1 doz, I bought the 2 doz. \nThen she asks if I've used a groupon from them before, which I haven't. She nods and smiles like \"suure, whatever\". \n\nThen she says \"The 2 doz groupon lets you get 1 doz per visit, so you have to come back on another visit for the other doz.\"\n\nAt this point, I already know I'm never coming back, so I don't want to do that. I ask, where in the groupon does it specify that? Of course, it does not, but she says that's how it works. Then I ask, couldn't I just get my first doz, walk out and come back in, so what would be the point? She just gives me that twisted smile again. Finally I showed her the groupon voucher on my phone and said there's no way to indicate that only the first 1 doz was redeemed. So if I tried to do what she said, I wouldn't be able to comeback for another doz. She said, \"I guess you just lose the other dozen.\"\n\nAt this point I said to her there's no way anything she said makes any sense and I wasn't going to do that. I wanted 2 doz right now from the flavors they have available. She said she'd \"let\" me have 2 doz, like she was doing me some kind of favor. \n\nI don't know what her problem was. Maybe she's new, there was a miscommunication when she was trained on the groupon, or she was just having a bad day. But it was an extremely frustrating experience because of her. \n\nThe cupcakes themselves actually aren't bad, so 1 star for that.", "author": "Tad G."}

Since my family was having a get together that day, I thought it would be perfect to bring to the party. I mean c'mon, what's better than a mini cupcake at a party?\n\nWalked in without calling in/ emailing the store first, but the person working the counter was nice enough to let me buy the cupcakes; I guess it was because it was a slow day.\n\nThis place has a decent selection of flavors, including all the favorite: aztec chocolate, red velvet, lavender honey, cinnamon horchata.. the list goes on.  If you buy a dozen, the cupcakes come in a smaller version of the typical pink to-go boxes you get at asian bakeries with a mission minis stamp on top.  The whole package presents well.\n\nThis place had everything going for it until I actually bit into the cupcakes.  As cute as they look, I would say it was one of my more disappointing cupcake experiences.  The cake itself was a bit dry- gave me the feeling that they might have been overbaked or day old. However, if you feel that cakes like the ones you get at Kara's or Sprinkles are too moist, you might find this place better.\n\nThe frosting to cake ratio was also disappointing.  When they say mini cupcakes, they really mean mini.  The cake itself is smaller than you would imagine when just looking at the cupcake, and that is because most of the cupcake's size comes from the sheer amount of frosting they apply to the top to make it actually look like a miniature version of what you would get at other cupcake places. Half the amount of frosting would suffice.\n\nThat all being said though, I would say that if you are in the area and happen to need to buy a small gift for whatever reason, this place is not a terrible option. These cupcakes present well, and are an inexpensive option for these types of occacssions.", "author": "Patricia K."}

Honestly they are a bit overpriced $1/each, but with the Groupon it was definitely worth it! It came at a perfect time for a couple coworkers' birthdays. Didn't know if we wanted a cake to celebrate, but this groupon gave us the option to get multiple flavors, share with more people at work, and save us the trouble of cutting a cake!\n\nTHE HIGHLIGHTS:\n~Ruby Red Velvet~\nRed velvet buttermilk cake with classic cream cheese frosting. -- A classic for any cupcake lover. The cake was moist and the cream cheese just sweet enough without overpowering the cake.\n\n~Cinnamon Horchata~ \nMexican rice milk cake with classic cream cheese frosting topped with freshly ground cinnamon -- Described in one word: CHURRO.

Cake seemed a bit dry..\n\n~Double Chocolate~\nDark cinnamon infused aztec chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream topped with multicolored sprinkles -- Just didn't stand out.

I was disappointed...the cake seemed dry and not enough of a coconut flavor.\n\n\nORDERING/PICK-UP:\nOrdering was a breeze. They have a copy and paste form which you fill out and email to them with at least 2 business days in ADVANCE.\n\nPick-Up was a bit tricky. Parking is scare, so it was a good thing I came with a coworker who double parked as I ran in to pick up the goods. They were already bagged and ready to go. However, the girl at the counter did mention (as I placed my Groupon on the counter) that I was suppose to mention in the order I was using a Groupon, as it affects how they enter the invoice in their system. I thought she was going to make a big stink about it, but she didn't-- so crisis averted. I'm usually very good about reading fine prints in Groupons, and after re-reading it again it made no instruction about mentioning in the order form that I was using a Groupon...Just something to note.\n\nPACKAGING: \nThey put a dozen cupcakes in one box, so I can imagine this getting ugly with cupcakes rolling around if you don't order by a multiple of 12.

My curiosity was piqued, especially when I saw that they had a vegan flavor, hooray!\n\nI am a strict vegan, so no eggs, dairy, honey, etc. al. On my first visit, at around 2:30 on a Saturday, they were already sold out of the vegan flavor. Bummer! I guess I would try again next time.\n\nI was already in the neighborhood today, so I stopped by. Again, only one vegan flavor, and there were 5 left. I purchased all 5 and gave 4 to my friends in the Hella Vegan Eats truck at the Mission Mercado, but did taste one, to see if they were any good.\n\nThey are very cute, for sure. These petite little cuties come in at about 100 calories a pop (so I've heard). Their one vegan flavor doesn't sound like the most appetizing one (Banana Maple Glaze), and it doesn't have the same creamy whipped frosting that the others have. \n\nWell, it wasn't the worst cupcake I've had, but definitely not the best. The banana flavor was a little overpowering without any frosting. The glaze doesn't provide enough sweetness. I think they should try to experiment and create an awesome dairy-free frosting and/or filling. I would even pay extra for the vegan flavor if it was a better one. \n\nAt least they don't break the bank , as these mini treats are only $1 each, which is really reasonable and affordable. \n\nWhy not bake more vegan flavors though? 9 regular and 1 vegan seems a little unbalanced, especially when you're smack-dab in the midst of the Mission in San Francisco, which is supposed to be a very veg-friendly, eco-friendly, hippie dippie city. Get on the bandwagon and ditch more dairy, even if that means two vegan flavors instead of one. Maybe then I would find more incentive to visit.", "author": "Brandi W."}

It seemed really run down to me.\n\nThe mini cupcakes are really cute, but don't taste as good as they look.  Also, they are priced at $2 a pop for a tiny cupcake.  We had the ruby reds and horchata cupcakes.  I know horchata is really a rice/cinnamon flavor, but it tasted like a cinnamon roll.  Nothing special.  I'd buy cupcakes from here if I was in the area, but I'm not going to go out of my way to buy them.", "author": "Richard N."}

I bought 6 there with different flavors before my class nearby one evening, thinking I'll just taste one and share the rest with my teacher. While I got to the class parking lot, it was around 5 pm, so I sat in my car and tried one. The next thing I knew was within about 3 minutes all of the cupcakes were gone; they became my dinner!!! I normally limit my intake of sweets but these mini cupcakes were soft, not overly sweet and the buttercream was also so soft, creamy and not very sweet. They kind of reminded me of the spongy yellow cale you can get at most Chinese bakeries in the Chinatown. Depending on what you are looking for, this could be a plus or minus. I wasn't expecting anything fancy going into this so was happy with what I got. \n\nThe store itself is very small and nothing fancy like other higher-end specialty cupcakeries. If you get there late, they may run out of the flavors on the menu. I just grabbed whatever they have got left on the counter. Also they don't carry standard size cupcakes on a regular basis. If you want those you have to pre-order them. That's probably good for the waistline and pocket for someone like me who just wants to taste different flavors on their menu.\n\nThe parking can be challenging but I got lucky and got a spot right in front of the shop.", "author": "Claire W."}

I don't consider myself a cupcake fanatic, and as a student with a limited budget, gourmet cupcakes aren't something I regularly indulge in. \n\nI looked online to see if I could find any deal for cupcakes in the city, and came across the Groupon instant deal, $5 for 6 cupcakes and a cup of coffee. The deal expired at 4 pm, so I planned my day to run errands around town and stop at Mission Mini's at the end of my trip to be rewarded with cupcakes. \n\nUnfortunately, there was traffic, so I was held up elsewhere in the city once the clock struck 4pm. I called the number on my groupon and ended up chatting with the owner of the store. He was so nice, and assured me I could come anytime that day before 6pm to redeem my coupon. \n\nI ended up at Mission Mini's around 5 pm (I took my sweet time getting there knowing I didn't have to rush anymore to meet the earlier deadline, picking my mom up on the way to bring her with me so I wouldn't be a fatty and eat all the cupcakes myself). There were two girls working. I showed them my coupon and they told me they had been expecting me (that was a nice feeling!). The girl told us all about their different flavors, recommending their peanut butter cupcakes (so yummy!). We also got the Ruby Red Velvet (I'm usually not a red velvet person but theirs was so good), Aztec Chocolate, Classic Vanilla, and Vegan Banana Maple(my mom's favorite). \n\nBecause it was near the end of the day, they were out of their other flavors. I'm a huge fan of lemon so I was disappointed they didn't have any when I went. But my disappointment didn't last long when the girl working gave us extra cupcakes! My mom fell in love with the Vegan Banana Maple, so the girl gave us two extra ones for free! Also, I didn't want the coffee that came with the deal, so I was able to forgo the coffee for 2 extra cupcakes. I had 12 cupcakes in total, all for $5! \n\nThis girl was so sweet and nice! The other cupcake shops I've been too, such as Karas and Sprinkles, the girls have been cordial for the most part, but sometimes give the vibe of being snobby. Not the case at Mission Minis! My mom and I felt so  welcome! \n\nI definitely plan on coming back to Mission Mini's again! Great service, delicious cupcakes, and super affordable!

When I got there a little after 4:00 yesterday, there were only three flavors left which was disappointing since I had a groupon for TWO DOZEN that was going to expire in about a month.  Since this place is in the Mission, it isn't the easiest place for me to get to, so I decided to use the groupon up and get it over with.  \n\nI was able to try the double chocolate which was very pungent. The cake was dry on that one.  The salesgirl said the vegan banana flavor was one of her favorites so I picked a couple of those up, too.  I actually thought that one had the best flavor and was very moist from the bananas.  But it was more reminiscent of a muffin, especially since it had a little trickle of glaze on it rather than frosting.  And third flavor I got to try was the peanut butter kiss which was also dry.  At least the frosting on this one was nice and peanutty.  I don't think I would care to go back to buy any more especially at $1 a pop.", "author": "Jeannette W."}

Very nice touch!\n\nAnother reason to love these mini cupcakes?  The frosting is sweet and buttery but it's not overwhelmingly sweet.  Part of the reason I am not a cupcake fanatic is that I find the frosting disgustingly sweet and sugary.  The frosting on these minis were well balanced, creamy, and had just the right amount of sweetness. \n\nThis move toward mini desserts is awesome.

The women at the store warned us that the box was not very sturdy and if you pushed up on the bottom, they would collapse. Since we had several other places to go throughout the day, the box was bound to bounce around in the car and they did! They toppled over and created such a mess. Not one to waste sugar, I ate them w/a fork when I got home anyway! :) \n\nI thought the cupcakes were just average. I guess what I couldn't understand is how a mini cupcake isn't moist?

Maybe because I love banana bread and it had a similar texture and taste. And the maple glaze on top, WOW. Imagine the maple glaze on a donut... similar but ligher. And the maple glaze had a design on the cupcake and not just dumped ontop. I LOVED THIS ONE.\n\n2)  PINK LEMONADE - first thought, you'd think sweet and sour at the same time. lies! the batter has a light lemon zest taste and the pink frosting ontop was absolutely perfect. the combination of both as it enters your palate gives you the taste of a pink lemonade... of course, in the shape and form of a min cupcake!\n\n3) SWISS ALMOND COCONUT - people either love coconut or hate coconut. well, this is quite a taste little treat. it was the best looking of the three that i chose only because the decor was cute. tiny cupcake, with light creamly looking frosting, and shaved almonds on top. it tasted pretty good too, light tasting., nothing like biting into an almond joy candy bar or anything of that nature. \n\nI liked my mini's so much, I got another batch.

There were rows and rows of them, I wanted to just grab a handful and engulf them all...heehee. \n\nIt was a small shop with just enough to fit about four to five ppl. The guy that helped us was really friendly. Each mini cupcake was $1 each. On their flavors board was a total of 10 different flavors. I wanted to try them all but they were sold outta Classic Vanilla, Pink Lemonade, and Ginger Carrot for the day. So, I got two of the rest of the seven flavors. \n\nPumpkin Spice: Just as if I was biting into a pumpkin pie but without the pie crust. It had just the right amount of cinnamon spice to it and the frosting on top was light. However, I'm not the biggest of pumpkin fans...so 4 stars.\n\nRuby Red Velvet: The cupcake itself was good, the cream cheese frosting was a bit to heavy to my taste and a little bit too thick too. 3 1/2 stars.\n\nSwiss Almond Coconut: Oooo...this one was yummy...it had strings of coconut on top of the buttercream frosting and the cupcake itself was tasty. 5 stars.\n\nCinnamon Horchata: Very cinnamon-like. Not too sweet. Reminds of of biting into a cinnamon bun. 4 1/2 stars.\n\nPeanut Butter Kiss: Very strong in smell and taste of peanut butter. As I bit into the peanut butter frosting, it was way too creamy and sweet. It felt like as if was taking a spoonful of just peanut butter in my mouth. It was too rich that it overwhelmed the taste of the cupcake itself. Definitely not my fave. 2 stars.\n\nBanana Maple Glaze: Mmmm...this one was good. Everything was equally balanced. The smell of banana from the cupcake was very inviting...the maple glaze was awesome too. 5 stars.\n\nAztec Chocolate: A little bit on the sweet side but not bad. Chocolate frosting on a chocolate cupcake...it also a great traditional combination. 4 stars. \n\nThe presentation of these minis are definitely worth lotsa brownie points.

Unfortunately they were not able to fulfill any orders over the St. Patrick's Day weekend (when the groupon deal occurred) so we had to wait until after the weekend to get our order. However, my cousin was able to get some for Tuesday so we quickly forgot about the delay and got excited at the prospect of after dinner sampling festivities! \n\nWe cut a set of the cupcakes in half so we could sample and talk about our reactions. We agreed that presentation-wise, the cupcakes are too damn cute. So cute in fact that all you want to do is just take pictures and post them all over yelp or facebook (See my pics). However the flavor was a different story. Disappointing is the word that comes to mind; what the cupcakes had going for it in presentation, they lacked in taste. The creme toppings were inconsistent often too sweet and the cake was very dry and crumbly.\n\nSwiss almond coconut: nice creme, coconut shavings gave good balance, cake was typical vanilla.\n\nRuby red velvet: nothing made it taste specifically like a red velvet at all. The aftertaste was also a bit weird and artificial.\n\nCinnamon horchata: the cake was very moist but the creme was way too sweet. Too much cinnamon sprinkled on that added to the poor result.\n\nAztec chocolate: the cake and creme were not too sweet but the cake was very crumbly. It didn't hold together after being cut in half so I had to use a fork to get the pieces into my mouth.\n\nPink lemonade: lemony taste was perfect but the creme was too sweet. Another dry cake.\n\nBanana maple glaze: very delicious and moist cake that didn't fall apart. The creme unfortunately was way too sweet. \n\nClassic vanilla: nothing special about this cupcake even though the cake, on the crumbly side, and the creme were not too sweet. Feels like I could have made this at home.\n\nGinger carrot: my favorite. Love the balance of ginger and carrot flavor. The cake was perfect and the creme, though slightly on the sweet side, was very good.\n\nPeanut butter kiss: My second favorite though the creme was way too sweet. I think I tolerated that because I expected this flavor to be on the sweet side anyway. \n\nI can't be too disappointed because we got a great deal through groupon.

He tells me they can't deny their customers who come in to buy cupcakes for the day.  So apparently I'm not considered a customer nor does me pre-ordering and pre-paying mean anything to them other than the fact that they got some extra cash in their pockets.  He wasn't pleasant in any kind of way, was definitely NOT apologetic about my order going awry.  I just picked out some cupcakes that I already had just to fulfill my order and get the f*&k out of that place before I murdered someone's face off.  \n\nI emailed the owner the day after, he said he was sorry but don't believe that he understands how frustrating it was to pre-order and pre-pay for something I never actually received.

This cupcake reminded me of thanksgiving.\n\nI was most excited to try the Swiss Almond Coconut (coconut + almonds = my FAVORITE). I was disappointed and found the cake to be dry and not  flavorful.  I still loved the sliced almond and shredded coconut topping and ended up just tossing the cake for the frosting ;)\n\nThe presentation of the cupcakes is PERFECT - they are just SO cute! If only they tasted  as sweet as they looked. I'm not a huge \"cupcake person\" (would much prefer a french macaroon!) but would vote for Kara's or Moonbaby cakes over Mission minis in a second. Going to give them another try eventually - maybe I just caught them on a \"dry day\"? I'll be back to taste the classic vanilla and the Meyer lemon creme.... but till then I'm saving my calories for a french almond macaroon!", "author": "Caroline J."}

Nothin spesh, a little dry, and frosting was really cream cheesy and thick...the texture of their cream cheese reminds me of a dog trying to eat peanut butter. \n\nSwiss Almond Coconut - I liked this one very much. The coconut in the batter was really good and the frosting was fluffy and not too sweet. The almonds added a nice crunch too. \n\nBanana - tasted very much like a banana muffin, but it was yummy because it was not too sweet and very moist. \n \nChoco pb - yum, this was probably my favorite one.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-12", "description": "I'm giving Mission Minis three stars, though there isn't anything wrong with their product. The cupcakes I ordered for my friend's birthday were moist and delicious. The miniature form had a number of pluses over the standard cupcake: easier to eat (one bite) and good frosting-cake ratio. Their flavor variety is also pretty good. At $0.99 a pop, I don't think they are really cheaper than a $3.50 cupcake by volume, but it is nice to be able to get a treat for a dollar. \n\nBut this is why I can't give it four stars:\n\n(1) I used a Groupon. I'm sure Mission Minis underestimated how many people would buy their Groupon and is overwhelmed, but they should be flattered! After reading a couple Yelp reviews I immediately placed an order for two dozen about 10 days in advance. There was no problem with this. I even got an email confirmation, which was nice. However, when I went to pick up in the store on Friday around 5:30pm (I had designated my pick up time to be 5-6pm), I felt like the guy behind the counter was annoyed with me. In fact, I dont' think he even greeted me; he just saw my Groupon that I was holding and asked for my name.\n\n(2) When you place an order, you can't choose how many of what flavor to go into the box (though you can choose the flavors, up to 5).  Really?? I am placing my order ten days in advance, and they can't plan for it? This was important to me, as the birthday girl loves vanilla, and not so much chocolate. I personally love red velvet, and out of 22 cupcakes, only 2 were red velvet. Incidentally, there was a sign in the store saying red velvet was sold out. So, basically, it seems as if they heavily prioritize in store customers. Not sure why this is, considering advance orders are placed in ... advance. \n\n(3) Two dozen fit into a box snuggly, so they don't shift around. But it's a heavy box. I asked for a bag, as I planned to keep walking around for the rest of the evening and had nowhere to keep them. I was given a tall and narrow bag with handles...the box is short and wide. It was a bit of a hassle to hold the box horizontally all evening. Ironically, the next day, I brought it to my friend's party in a Sprinkles bag, which fit the box perfectly. \n\nThese are perhaps nitpicky points, and I certainly don't want to discourage anyone from paying Mission Minis when in the area, but there are just some things that they might want to think through further.", "author": "Ada T."}

The ones that we tasted right away were really good and moist, and just the right size for a delightful snack.\n\nHowever, I wish the ones that I ordered were the same. I honestly believe the ones I received were left from the night before or maybe even longer. The frosting was hard on most of them, and in fact came off as one piece when I'd try to lift it off the cupcake because it didn't taste good. Usually when frosting does that is when it had been sitting around for a bit, ie when left out overnight. Even if the cupcake was left sitting out all day, I don't think it would do that!! But not only that, but some of the cakes themselves were harder than others as well! Again, leading me to believe that some were old. There was no bounce, no fluffiness to the cupcakes.\nI just couldn't believe they would do something like that! \n\nIf you walk in off the street, it may be your best bet since your cupcakes would be more fresh than if you had pre-ordered them. I don't know how well they'd do then if they had to cater a party or event to grow their business.

My friends changed dinner plans to Sunday, I became ecstatic to once again be able to use my groupon. I call them Friday morning and yet again, they said they could not take my order. BLAST!!! *Please believe, that the amount of frustration I felt cannot be exemplified in this review.* Luckily the guy I talked to told me that I COULD come in and just pick out my cupcakes. YAY!!! \n\nSunday was raining like hell, but I hauled ass early in the morning to go and pick out my two dozen cupcakes for fear of them running out. I became pretty psychotic over these cupcakes, but thankfully everything worked out. The guy was super helpful and friendly. Birthday girls were surprised and the cupcakes were quite good. \n\nWe had pretty much all the flavors on their menu and my reactions to them:\n\n+Classic Vanilla - normal\n+Pink Lemonade - good\n+Aztec Chocolate - good\n+Cinnamon Horchata - cake was really dry, disappointing\n+Ruby Red Velvet - yum, yum\n+Swiss Almond Coconut - pretty good considering I'm not big on coconut\n+Banana Maple Glaze - tastes like banana bread which I love\n+Ginger Carrot - really good, moist and flavor was perfect\n+Peanut Butter Kiss - meh, not a big fan of peanut butter\n\nAll in all, it was quite the experience. I would probably eat these again, but will probably not try to order them in advance ever again. \n\nIf you made it to the end of this review, kudos to you for reading my complaint!", "author": "Dolores L."}

I was definitely underwhelmed.  I agree with a lot of the reviewers on Yelp, these cupcakes are way too dry.  Especially the Aztec chocolate, which is my favorite combo, white icing on chocolate cake, that was the driest of them all.  I also tried the red velvet, cinnamon horchata, chocolate banana (this one is new, it's just the vegan banana with chocolate icing), blueberry, swiss almond coconut, and the chocolate vanilla.  Maybe it's because these are mini and it's hard to not dry them out because they are small, but I'll stick with a regular size cupcake from now on.\n\nI have also tried Cups and Cakes and That Takes the Cake and of the 3, I like That Takes the Cake the best.

I was so excited about Mission Minis, especially considering their convenient location in the Mission and how adorable and tasty everything looked. \n\nHowever, I was so disappointed by the cupcakes that I doubt I'm ever going to go back. I ordered three flavors -- classic vanilla, pink lemonade, and red velvet. The only true winner of the trip was the classic vanilla cupcake, which I'd only bought because it was my first time at the shop and wanted something plain to start out with. Pink lemonade tasted nothing like what they described on their website (lemon cake with blackberry meringue buttercream). While the flavor itself was okay, it was a little annoying that it tasted more like strawberry frosting on a slightly lemon-tinted vanilla cake. Also, meringue buttercream? Talk about lies -- it tasted simply like buttercream to me. The real disappointment, however, was the red velvet, normally my favorite flavor. Having had my fair share of red velvet cakes in my time, I'm sorry to report that this was one of the worst red velvet cakes I'd ever had -- just super dry and almost stale. It almost tasted like nothing it was supposed to. \n\nI'm sorry to say that the entire experience was incredibly underwhelming and I most likely will not be coming back.

Make it kawaii and make it cheaper than the other trendy options out there.  That equation guarantees at least the cold portion of the Asian heart that loves a deal.

To the mission.  Ha ha ... ha. \n\nI liked the price here.  It's $1.  Per mini.  And they only do minis.  It's like the Korean Soondobu places that only do Soondobu.  And at the same price.  I don't like the small variations between the \"filled\" and \"seasonal\" and \"orgasmic\" or \"magic.\"  I like to know that each whole integer can be exchanged for something red with white cream cheese frosting on top.\n\nI've tried various ones.  But I come back to the red velvet.  The red velvet here is great.  It's red.  Not devil food cake brown.  But red.  Like Scarlet O'Hara if she were made into a cupcake.  The icing is the right amount.  It's not too buttery (ahem, cupkate).  The cake is dense and does not fall apart when I try to take the cupcake wrapper off.\n\nDon't you hate that when it happens?  it's like there was not enough flour inside or they didn't think to mix it, and when the wrapper comes off, these huge crumbs just disintegrate and fall off with the cupcake.  Why?  \n\nThe pink lemonade was just fine.  I actually like the buttercream on this and normally, I think of buttercream like a Prince Albert. \n\nSmores had the marshmallow topping.

They were so excited to see the petite size of these cakes.  It was decided to get 6 cupcakes and share between the 3, so we ordered the Cinnamon Horchata, Aztec Chocolate, Ruby Red Velvet, Banana Maple Glaze, Peanut Butter Kiss, Swiss Almond Coconut\n\nWe absolutely loved the peanut butter kiss (which essentially tasted like a reese's peanut butter cup...yummy), the aztec chocolate, swiss almond coconut, and banana maple glaze.  These were perfectly moist and sweet.  We all loved the flavored cream cheese frosting on most of the cupcakes.  The horchata cupcake was more cinnamon tasting than horchata.  I imagine it difficult to make a cake taste milky-ricey-cinnamony like the drink.\n\nAfter eating the half dozen cupcakes, we realized there were only three flavors left to try.  So we walked back in and got the pink lemonade, classic vanilla, and ginger carrot.  Of this batch our hands down favorite was ginger carrot.  It wasn't too gingery, which would have been a turn off for all of us.  It was perfect.  None of us liked the pink lemonade, the lemon flavor was a bit off.  The vanilla was your typical moist and sweet vanilla cupcake.  So, in the end, we liked 7/9 cupcakes, not bad!\n\nI will definately return and will definately tell friends to stop by and try these little goodies.", "author": "Lesliegh H."}

I first tried their cupcakes at the YoCup in Rincon Center, so I knew exactly what I was getting. The cake is moist and the frosting is perfectly balanced. I love how the cupcakes look really delicate but are packed with flavor! I used to not think of myself as a cupcake snob, but then I moved to San Francisco and tried a few less-than-stellar trendy desserts... and, well, Mission Minis has totally turned me around! I'm not jaded anymore!\n\nAnyway, the business doesn't only earn 5 stars for flavor. I love that they're sold at a bunch of convenient locations like YoCup and Whole Foods. Even better, they deliver. Brandon is a genius for posting photos of tons of mini cupcakes to Twitter... so when I needed a relatively last-minute dessert delivery for my boyfriend's birthday, I tweeted a request and got set up with an order within a day of emailing my many, many questions. Great service! The cupcakes arrived nicely packaged too -- all in cardboard trays that kept the cupcakes apart from each other. Our coworkers couldn't get enough!\n\nI don't want to knock other local businesses too much. To be honest, they make pretty darn good desserts as well. But I do prefer Mission Minis to Miette, Kara's Cupcakes, and Sweet. I think they're reasonably priced ($1 a piece at retail, or $15/dozen including delivery) and perfectly portioned. Since they're fairly small, you can either restrain yourself and not eat too much... or go nuts and eat one of every single flavor ^__^", "author": "Sharon W."}

I hope they read this.\n\nI'll start with what went right.\n\n1 star for the awesome frosting & bite-sized portions.\n\nNow, the bad news...\n\n-3 stars for service.  \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e & I finally got time to cash in our Groupon deals (2 coupons for 2 dozen each) since we planned to be in SF last weekend (We drove from the Peninsula - 30-40 mins away from The Mission).  We both emailed our order 2 days prior to pick with our cupcake order & time of pick up & we both got a confirmation email w/ a pdf invoice of our order.  Being at the Mission, parking was & will always be an issue so we decided to just have my fianc\u00e9e pick our orders while I drive around looking for a place to park (I should deduct the only star left for this but it's not really their fault).  \n\nAfter being in line for almost 15 minutes (yep, for a pick up order, this IS a long wait), the people who worked there told her they can't give her my order (even though she had my coupon print-out) & that I had to go inside & claim it myself.  To add insult to injury, they did not prepare her order & since it was late in the day, they RAN OUT of the flavors she wanted. So, disappointed & obviously annoyed, my fianc\u00e9e filled me in & I went in for my order (while blocking traffic mind you).  I got inside, waited for 5 minutes & was shocked (not really) that they could not find my order.  So, they also did not prepare my order & asked me if I can still remember my order. I showed them the pdf of my order in my phone (as proof that I ordered, paid & got a confirmation) & was told they ran out of Red Velvet.  So basically they just gave me a random box of SOMEONE ELSE's order (I guess, if you don't show up, they sell your order-- I sure hope they only do that to people who haven't paid).  The guy even promised that the cupcakes were made today & are fresh (REALLY?).  I just took whatever they gave me & went back to our car.\n\n-1 star for Inventory & Cupcake Taste/Quality/Value\n\nI understand they owners/employees want to avoid waste & only make cupcakes that would sell for the day in order to keep the freshness legit but come on.. they have been open for sometime & they should have an idea on what flavors sell out & which ones that do not. Or at least bake a new batch if you are about to run out.. hello, the bakery is just right behind you.\n\nAs for taste/quality... granted they have awesome tasting frosting but that doesn't even make up for the fact that most of the cupcakes were dry.  It made me question if the random box I got was actually fresh.  I have read other reviews & i'm not alone w/ this gripe.  Being priced at $1 a mini cupcake, we expected to be blown away.  \n\nWe weren't.\n\nWe recommend alternatives for cupcake lovers (and we are cupcake lovers) such as:\n\nThat Takes The Cake in Union St at SF, CA -- Parking not much of an issue & the cakes were really moist & the frostings are amazing.  But come in early, they bake their cupcakes in the East Bay so they also have the inventory issues of Mission Minis\n\nSibby's Cupcakery in San Mateo, CA -- They have no store front so all orders are email/call in orders 48 hours before pick up.  They confirm & collect payment even before you pick up your order so the pick up would be fast & quick (also, if you come in late in the day and if they have extras, you can buy some more).  My fianc\u00e9e's coworkers gave her a dozen full sized cupcakes as an engagement day gift (Frosting was custom built to have rings and \"i do\" on the cakes).  I can still taste the awesome cupcakes & frosting.  Excellent product & service.\n\nIcing on the Cake from Los Gatos, CA -- Awesome tasting cupcakes & great selection of flavors.\n\nSprinkles in Stanford Mall Palo Alto, CA -- Not really a big fan of Sprinkles but their cupcakes are better than Mission Minis. Plus, my coworker follows them on Twitter so he scores free cupcakes. \n\nThe Cupcakery in Las Vegas (more like Henderson), NV - Yep, I even took home 2 dozen of these babies from Las Vegas.  The cupcakes stayed moist up to a day after we got home in SF.  An amazing feat considering we bought them in the middle of the desert.  Frosting was great too.\n\nMagnolia Bakery in the Greenwich Village in NY- If the name sounds familiar, yes it is the cupcake place Carrie Bradshaw had her cupcake fix.  There was a line but it was worth it.  Frosting was creamy & yes.. the cakes were moist too.\n\nSo there you go. I hope the owners of Mission Minis would get their act together & fix these issues. Granted we used a Groupon deal so our orders were not \"worth\" as much as walk-in customers, but a customer is a customer.  Groupon was your chance to hook new customers.  But you failed to wow us and we may never come back. \n\nPlease, improve your service and fix the dry issue. I hate to see a local business suffer because of issues the owners can do WAY better.", "author": "Arnold V."}

I had two dozen of your pretty minis.  Clearly very buttery from the oil soaked exteriors of the pink boxes.  Here's the problem.  You just don't make a super tasty cupcake.  Perhaps it's all organic and local and healthy or something that gets a small pass for not being delicious.  I've just had much better elsewhere.  I ended up eating the cupcake top (like muffin tops) for breakfast two days in a row.  Blueberry was my fav, followed by your classic vanilla.", "author": "Poppy C."}

In the interest of full disclosure, I lead a rather dull and cupcake-less life and never eat the things. My life is also tattoo-less and TV-less....and traffic jam-less....but at least  I am not tooth-less (thank god), owing in part to my cupcake-free ways; guess I never got the memo that cupcakes were the \"new black\".  Was it a top food / top chef TV network conspiracy craze or something?  Well anyhow,  this review is more for the shopping experience  at MM from  pre-ordering to pick-up to post consumer feedback about your cute little critters. On a late  Sunday night, I emailed an order for about 50 cupcakes to bring to an event on the following Tues.  I rec'd email confirmation of the order the very next day, thank you for that. Because I'm also wrist watch-less, I left work a little late on Tues (the day of the big batch pick-up).  and raced over to you to get the goods before  closing.  Fortunately, (since I 'm not phone-less or brain-less) I had the smarts to call ahead to let you know I was running late and enroute. Your cheerful cupcake counter lady replied that my order was all baked up,  boxed up, bagged up and rhet-to-go for me.  I think I'd ordered about 5 of everything.  The entire process was so  smooth and  hassle-free. At the party, there were countless  ooohs and ahhhs and compliments specifically about your cupcake creations.....and.....I .....(woefully naive and unhip little ole me),  was a big-hit wonder at the event. Thank you Mission Minis for having my back and  for saving my face and making me look so good.", "author": "Baby J."}

Thanks for the reminder that the voucher was about to expire. So a few friends of mine had a playdate for our children at Party Playhouse. I decided what perfect timing for me to go pick up some mini cupcakes for the kids as a treat. I called ahead to make sure I didn't need to call ahead 48 hours like it says on the voucher. The person from the bakery was very pleasant to talk to and told me that as long as they're not special orders, I could come by and pick out any flavor they had on the shelf. I got there and the worker quickly gathered my variety selection. The children were excited I had cupcakes for them. My daughter only likes frosting, so she gave me her cupcake as soon as she was done licking up the frosting. I thought it was delicious. I saved half a dozen for a friend I was going to visit that afternoon. I had about half a dozen left to bring back to my mom's. Before heading down to my friend's for a visit with the half dozen, I decided to try one more of mine. I think I tried the Classic Vanilla. It was so tasty, I quickly ate another one. I must've had four or five by the end. Mission Minis, I love your cupcakes! I've tried the others' that some people have mentioned, but theirs were so sweet, I would never go back.

Very much true to its name as it is in the heart of the Mission district. I checked them out the last time I was in the area and was a bit of bust for me. Perhaps it was sweetness of the frosting (very) in relation to the cake (very small).  The biggest disappointment for me came when I tasted the horchata cupcake. A poor imitation compared to the horchata cupcake I had from Cynsational Delights. I would recommend you check out cynsational delights to compare for yourself.

It was just dry and the outer crust was hard. I brought a dozen to a BBQ and someone else brought cupcakes from Sweet Dreams (?) in Colma. It put my cupcakes to shame as theirs were fluffy and very moist. It was also slightly larger. Needless, to say, I didn't even touch one from Mission Minis. Dam, I have another Groupon for it too.", "author": "Freckles H."}

I ordered the Red Velvet, Chocolate with Chocolate Frosting, Lemon and Swiss Almond Coconut.  All of the cakes were very dry and the frostings had very little flavor.  The most disappointing was the Coconut.  Not only was the cake very dry, the frosting tasted like old butter.  They need to learn how to make cupcakes from Sibby's Cupcakes.   Also, whoever they have working at their counter needs to be taught personal customer service.", "author": "Kathy P."}

Cupcakes are the newest fad food and bakeries are trying to make cupcakes a luxury item when they are not. These cupcakes should be called nano not mini because my thumb was bigger than the damn thing. I even tried Kara's cupcakes and didn't see what the big deal was. I've had equally as good quality of cupcakes at regular bakeries without the price spike.", "author": "Shahram S."}

The first time I ordered 8 dozen for a party and they were pretty dry, but I gave it another shot recently and still...very dry. They are super cute and present really well, and the frosting is really good, so I just wish they would maybe undercook the cupcakes a bit or change something to see what customers' responses are because I think they have such potential. The service is great - - I've used all methods: online ordering, delivery, walk-in, scheduled pick up. Very friendly service each time.", "author": "J. Y."}

Couldn't get through ALL WEEKEND because as I later found out, they have an internet phone and their internet service was down. I went to the place and it was about an hour before they opened. They refused to accept my order because it was now \"too late\" even though their phones were down. I called again later to speak to a manager but they weren't there that day and they would not take a message to have them call me back. A little customer service goes a LONG WAY folks!!!", "author": "Lori M."}

I keep seeing all these good deals and can't stop, Cupcakes aren't usually my thing but I decided to give it a try. I ordered 2 dozen for $12 and each cupcake is usually $1 each, so this was a deal I couldn't refuse. I've had these cupcakes before at random events but I wanted to try different flavors. My default: red velvet and my newbies: Pink Lemonade, Peanut Butter Kiss, and Blueberries & Cream. So what makes a good cupcake? My opinion is based more on the cake and less on the frosting. But in this case, I was not wow'ed by the cake - it was dry. I know mini cupcakes are hard to get \"just right\" and most places overbake them but this place is suppose to specialize in minis. Now, the frosting is a different story - very flavorful and fluffy. I thought I was eating peanut butter right off a spoon when I bit into the Peanut Butter Kiss frosting. The Pink Lemonade has a light touch of citrus which made me forget about the texture of the cake. The frosting makes this cupcake worth trying at least once or twice.", "author": "Candace F."}

I arrived at 6:05 on a Sunday night and was disappointed to see that they had just closed.  I was standing at the window, about to turn around completely bummed to have missed them - when the salesperson saw me and let me in!  My excitement could not be contained and I ordered one of every flavor.  My favorites were the Aztec Chocolate, Cinnamon and Peanut Butter Kiss.  Mmm who doesn't love a mini-dessert?  They sure are tricky because you can't (or rather, I can't) eat just one!  I'll definitely go back!", "author": "Nicole H."}

I've had Mission Minis cupcakes in several places now, and they are always super-tasty and adorably presented. I love their bite-sized-ness. I think the Cinnamon Horchata is probably my favorite, but please don't make me choose! Plus, the staff are super awesome. I recently worked with them for an event, and they were so friendly and responsive - couldn't have been more pleasant. I'm a fan!", "author": "Margaret M."}
