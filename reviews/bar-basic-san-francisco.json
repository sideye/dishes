Mike is the SHYT!\n\nBar Basic is the place to be Friday and Saturday nights. Located right in SF where all the action is taking place, Bar Basic truly stands out with their delicious drinks and great Happy Hour deals! Great vibes here and everyone always seem to have a great time. \n\nMy girlfriend introduced me to this bar in 2017 and ever since that I've been a true fan. We came here to celebrate the owner, Mikes, birthday and I must say, he knows how to throw a DAMN good partay! There were drinks flowing ALL.NIGHT.LONG! Drinks offered, but not limited to: Kettle One, Fernet, Whisky and Jameson. \n\nThis place is perfect for after work get together to chill and relax with a drink in your hand. The bar has a lovely cozy vibe with comfortable lounge seating and small tables. \n\nThe bar doesn't serve food, but the owner does allow you to BYOF (Bring Your Own Food). The staffs here are always so friendly and attentive. \n\nOh, wait! Don't forget about the cute little bar dog, Butter! He is the CUTEST! The owner, Mike, will bring him to the bar every now and then and he just the BEST. Make sure you say hi if/when you see him. \nThis is one of my FAVORITE places to come after work. I just LOVE how lively it gets after hours. \n\nDefinitely a place to come visit Friday-Monday!", "author": "Porsche C."}

Try the mystery shot from a crate of about a dozen liquor bottles. It costs $3 and could be fun. It depends. You pick a number from a set and that number correspond to the liquor shot. However, it is no joke if you're mixing or planning to have different alcohols on your outing. Believe that the next day!\n\nIt is crowded at times but not always. At HH opening it was relatively sparse, as well as on a Saturday night I went. The low lighting at night made it looked like a dive bar but once your eyes adjust it's not, and the seating is cushy/loungy so it's a nice mix for everyone.

The fear of getting something terrible really adds to the excitement, so I'm not complaining!\n\nAnd if shots aren't your thing, they've got a diverse selection of cocktails and beers. The cocktails always seemed a little boozy for my tastes, but your mileage may vary. It's one of the surprisingly few places you can find Allagash White in SoMa, so that alone should be enough to tempt you if you're on the fence.\n\nThey've also got trivia night, a Rockbot music system you can queue songs to from your phone, and some old video games in the back. Plus, with Yelp Cash Back you can take 10% off your tab (so, half your tip), which is a cool bonus.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun place to go with your friends, take a couple shots, and sip a cocktail.

I got some vanilla vodka thing which was meh, but my date got a cucumber lime vodka shot which actually smelled quite nice...almost.\n\nThe bar had a divey atmosphere.

I thought this place was more of a 'dive bar' from the outside, but once you walk in it's actually quite nice.  There is a lot of open space , a decent sized bar and a wall lined with couches for lounging.  I arrived around 5:30 on a Wednesday only to find a few patrons (and a dog!) enjoying some drinks. \n\nBar basic has a great daily happy hour.  Monday - Friday from 5-9 you get dollar off drafts, $7 glasses of wine and a specialty martini or well drinks for about $6 I believe.  I went for a gin gimlet, it was refreshing and service was quick.  The bartender was friendly and really spent a lot of time cleaning in between making drinks/down time so I always appreciate that.  \n\nI do wish there were some better seating options, maybe some high top tables, it is a little awkward if there are more than a group of 3 with seating as the booth is just lined against one wall.  Otherwise, a perfect HH spot especially for those looking to be close to public transit.\ncheers!", "author": "Kelsey B."}

This part is hard to describe, but the furnishings are nice, the lighting is well done and overall it feels like a well put together interior. All this while still feeling divey enough to feel at home.\n\n4) Trivia night! Every tuesday there is a fun trivia night with free food, fun times and prizes to be won. (Guess who won this week? That's right, we did.)\n\n5) Whiskey saturdays. Discounted whiskey all saturday, every saturday. Can't go wrong with that.\n\n6) Best of all... BOX SHOTS! This fantastic option is what got us hooked and keeps us coming back. They have a box of 12 mystery bottles and everyone chooses a number and then you get $3 shots of whatever you chose. It's fun, it's interactive and it adds a great element of surprise.\n\nOverall, Bar Basic is a great bar that I can't recommend enough.", "author": "Mark O."}

It's not a dive bar for sure because they've got lots of fancy cocktails and a couple of flat screens to boot, but nothing to write home about here. Draft selection is minimal, so just pull up a bar stool and kick back while watching the game. Good place to wait out a wait at Marlowe or Cockscomb. Oh yeah, they have twelve bottle of well liquor in a wooden box on the counter behind the bar.

About a ten minute walk to the ballpark, and parking seems to be slightly easier (6pm expiring meters). Their happy hour is not bad, either. I went with the $4 (pre-tip) Anchor Steam in a 16 oz pour. Tasted a little bitter, but I don't drink the stuff regularly, so maybe that's intentional. Not sure why some people refer to this as a \"dive\" bar, I've been to plenty of those and this certainly doesn't fit the bill. The only quality it shares with some of those dubious establishments is climate; as inside it's quite cold sitting at the bar. They have a decent amount of room, although it's narrow. There's bar seating on the right and then some lounge-like tables/seats on the left. This place must draw a decent work crowd, because after 5pm, it got pretty packed. But the one bartender was very good; no one seemed to have to wait too long for service. There's also a Doblet phone charging station at the bar, not sure if it costs money or not. Seems you can charge your devices at least 4 in a clip if your running low on battery. Thought that was pretty cool, as I've never seen that at a bar before. I only went with one libation, but would be back (probably just to get beers, their cocktails didn't look super appealing, but they do offer more than just Rum and Cokes) if in the area or heading over to Los Gigantes after. Also have TV's for sports inside and one of those digital jukeboxs (somewhere, couldn't see it when I went) for music. And having a urinal in the men's bathroom as well as the actual toilet itself?

It's Monday morning and you check your account activity from over the weekend only to find something like the following:\n\n11.11.11 Bubble Lounge $52.19 \n11.11.11 Bubble Lounge $38.52\n11.11.11 Bubble Lounge $72.68\n11.12.11 The Grand $30.00\n11.12.11 The Grand $50.00\n11.12.11 The Grand $40.00\n.....\n\nAfter said and done, you've spent nearly $300 at the bar/club.

There's an old school Nintendo system with Super Mario Bros., my all-time favorite video game. Talk about nostalgia. I like that Bar Basic is not overly crowded on weeknights though it's a different story on weekends when I've passed by. After a hard day in the office, there's nothing worse than having to dodge people and wait 15 minutes for a drink.\n\nWith Bar Basic's $5 Martini's during Happy Hour, Monday-Friday 4pm-9pm, it makes the lush in me rejoice! Pick your poison: Dirty & Neat, Cosmo, Appletini, Pomegranate, Peach, Mango or Chocolate Espresso. The Peach Martini was my poison of choice. My recession-friendly cocktail packed a big punch (no skimping on alcohol here) with just the right balance of sweetness and subtle tartness. With just three martinis, I was happily buzzed as opposed to the six I normally need. I've sadly trained my liver well.\n\nOn Tuesday, I noticed a cutie pie sitting all by his lone self at the bar. Too bad the cutie was a four-legged terrier mix.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-21", "description": "If you're looking for an intimate lounge bar for a casual birthday affair - Bar Basic works. \n\nBar Basic works because they're so under the radar in their location, that there seems to be a steady crowd of about 2 or 3 people on any given night. You could easily throw a laid-back party here with a gathering of close friends, and not have to stress about rental costs and bar minimums.\n\nThere's nothing particularly compelling about Bar Basic. They can easily accommodate about 50-75 people comfortably. They have casual chic seating, and a pleasant long booth area, which stretches down one whole side of the place. They have a solid bar. They feature three big screens (each usually playing something different), as well as a Nintendo system (Mario Bros, and Duck Hunt). And on most nights play host to a DJ.\n\nBut that's about it for Bar Basic. They got the basics, and...yeah. Despite having the place pretty much to ourselves this Friday, we ended up leaving after an hour. We left in search of a more lively bar with more interesting people watching, with a little bit more soul, and with a little bit more get-go in it.\n\nBar Basic is fine for quiet nights, especially if you bring the crowd, but if you want more action and personality in your evening, I'd suggest a slew of other spots first.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

The clean decor creates a loungey atmosphere --perfect for having an easy conversation without the eardrum-popping music in the background. Their short cocktail menu includes old school cocktails: old fashioned, manhattan or a gimlet for under $9. I'm happy with just a plain Tanqueray & Tonic and the lady bartender made my drink with a smile. \n\nIf you're in the hood for after work drinks, bar basic has $5 happy hour martinis (calling all apple martini and cosmo lovers!) on weekdays from 5pm-9pm.

We walked in to a 75% filled capacity room, bar on the right and couches and tables on the left. Bathroom is in the back, holla!\n\nChristine B. sums up the perks of this place quite nicely, so before I got there I knew what I wanted to get: $3 MYSTERY SHOTS. They have a crate full of random bottles of alcohol \"numbered\" 1 - 12 (my friend suspects they only have 8), and when you order, you choose a number and the bartender pours you a huge shotglass of whatever the heck they pick up. One friend ordered our group's VIP mystery shot #1 while I ordered him #2 and #3, and the VIP said that two of them tasted exactly the same...good thing it wasn't a nasty repeat! Also, from my friends who went through a good number of the mystery box, they recommend going for any of the shots that are brown-colored. From my experience, that could be number 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and/or 8. There is also a light pink/lavender one that tastes fruity, which is #6, 7, or 8. Sorry, we bulk-purchased that night :| But our goal was to have our VIP go through ALL 12. Unfortunately, he only went through 8. But if our conspiracy theory is correct, there ARE only 8...\n\nYelp check-in gets you $1 off any beer or cocktail. Drafts beers including Stella, Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, Widmer Hefeweizen, Coors Light, and Pyramid Thunderhead IPA. I bought my friend a Widmer Hefeweizen, which was originally $5 but came out to $4 after the Yelp offer yay! Although, I bought her the beer during happy hour, and $5 might have been a promo price? Unsure.\n\nHappy hour is Monday - Friday from 4 - 9 PM, where martinis are $5! They have a variety of flavors: Cosmopolitan, appletini, pomegranate, lychee, and more! My friend got me a Cosmo, which was too sweetly sour for my tastes. And strangely enough, they offer boba in your drink for $3 more, if I remember correctly. BOBA AND ALCOHOL!? My friend and I were too chicken to try it :(\n\nbtw, a \"Dark & Stormy\" is rum & beer. It made me feel dark & stormy--gross :( And a shot of Jameson whiskey is $8. Wine runs you $8 or 9 a glass.\n\nThe music is actually chosen by you! The bar uses Roqbot, a mobile app driven song selection service that uses votes to determine what songs to play. If you really want to have the power of the night's music in your hands, I'd recommend downloading it beforehand ;) Here's some more information on that: http://allthingsd.com/20120612/google-ventures-backed-roqbot-lets-you-rock-the-jukebox-from-your-phone/\n\nRandom: I hit one of the bar stools and pricked my pointer finger! It started bleeding pretty fiercely, so I slapped on a bandaid (I'm always prepared) and then turned the debacle into an avenue for amusement when one of my friend's friends tried to Hello-Kitty-ize my bandaid lol. From my friend's POV, it ended up looking like a hairy butt HAHA.\n\n$10 minimum charge on credit cards. Get around this by buying mystery shots for you and 2 friends...or all 3 for one friend hehehe. Also, there are coat hooks UNDER the bar. Crazy! Just remember to grab your coat before you leave!\n\nFYI: Street parking is free at night! I'd recommend scouting near the Caltrain station for spaces ;)", "author": "Adele F."}

To our surprise, there was only one other group there. The entire place was deserted. Kind of strange, but understandable due to their location. \n\nService was quick but nothing special. The bartender looked like she didn't really want to be there. Once we presented Yelp check-in offers, she became a little bit more disgruntled.\n\nDrinks are mediocre. All of their \"specials\" that are on the board are pretty standard drinks. They have a great selection of liqueurs on the wall if you're going for something on the rocks. \n\nIf you're in the area, you might as well check it out for a drink or two, but I don't think it's worth going out of your way to explore.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

LAME LAME PLACE. \n\nWe can here on a weeknight for the first time a while back. We ignored the lame \"top 40\" music playing in the background and ordered martinis. Whatever. A drink is a drink. Then at 11:40 she calls last call and we ask, okay, what time do you guys close and we're told midnight. We asked do we have time for another drink. WE WERE TOLD YES.  Ok, that's enough for a last drink. Except it wasn't because we WERE ASKED TO LEAVE AT 11:50. Not only asked but angrily barked at by some guy I'm guessing the manager or someone who was annoyed that we were still there and actually asked us to leave before midnight. Hello, you just sold us a drink! If you didn't want us to drink it you didn't have to sell it to us!! \n\nI'm sorry but selling someone a martini and expecting them to chug it is ridiculous. We had no problem leaving at 11:40 which was why we asked if we had time for another drink. Either keep to your word and allow the patrons (us) to drink in peace until midnight (like you said) or just tell us, actually, sorry, we want to go home. No problem with that.

It's smack dab in SoMa and used to be the Gallery Lounge (what are they drinking in Cupertino?).\n\nBar Basic lives up to its name: Nothing on the walls, a long black banquette along the wall opposite the bar with seating cubes and some short tables.  All of this is fine.  It's the theme and the look they're going for.  I get it.  I found the seating comfortable and useful.  Not all bars can offer this.\n\nI had a Widmer Hefeweizen to drink and it was a little lukewarm if I'm being honest.  Call me an American, but certain beers should be cold, and I count hefeweizen among them. But, who cares, right? I can forgive beer that not cold enough.\n\nWhat I can't forgive is the lack of attention to customer service.  After enduring the incredibly loud music playing overhead (why does this place even need a DJ?), I asked if the bartender could turn it down just a little.  I was literally yelling my conversation with my friends--as were other patrons.  The only people who seemed to be fine with the sonic chaos was the birthday group in the back to which the \"DJ\" seemed to belong.  To her credit, she asked Mr. DJ to turn it down and he did--for about 5 minutes.  Then, the music (which was also inappropriate for the space and them--basic it was not: techno/industrial does not make me think \"basic.\") volume crept back up.  \n\nEventually, it was so loud, we decided against a second drink (we went to Marlowe instead).  I left the bar, decided I had to say something to the bartender, and went back in.  She seemed surprised that I thought it was loud and said she had asked the DJ to turn it down a little.  I responded that he had subsequently turned it back up, so she offered to ask again.  Of course, I was leaving at that point, so it didn't matter.\n\nI guess I have to ask: Who's running Bar Basic?

I also saw a 90's nintendo console there, but havent seen anyone play it though. Watch out for an asian bartender guy though. He isn't mostly there, but he once charged me a dollar extra for a drink. Not a big deal, but still.", "author": "Lijo L."}

It has nice new decor with interesting drinks, and you definitely can get some good drinks without spending a grip during happy hour.  Music is a mix of top 40 and alternative but the friendly owner is open to any music suggestion!\n\nHaving convenient street parking nearby is definitely a plus too!!  Can't wait to check out the place when it's remodeled.", "author": "Jeff S."}

I enjoy how it is near the train station so if I have a tough day, and can co e unwind here. Also the fact they have old school street fighter ll up In There makes it better.

I remember it being super loud inside though so please spare your dog's hearing and leave him at home.\n\nIt's not really somewhere I can see myself hanging out at for more than 1 or 2 drinks, but it's a good place to start the night off at.\n\nWe got a round of Dark and Foggys and they were awful.  I can handle some pretty bad rum drinks but I have no idea what was in this-- there was no syrup or citrus, that's for sure.  Disappointing, but I'll be back for the venue itself.", "author": "S L."}

Decent amount of seating, tvs playing games, and the music is controlled via guests' iphones. The wine list is rather small, but in line with what I would expect from a place like this.

The drinks are strong and cheap (especially with the ridiculously long happy hour- I mean, it goes until 9pm. Where else do you know has a happy hour until 9pm?!), it's not usually crowded, and the bartenders are friendly. Actually, the crowd kind of ebbs & flows here- sometimes it's dead, sometimes it's packed- but we always have a good time here. Some nights they have djs; the rest of the time they have something called Roqbot, which is awesome bc you can pick songs you want to hear with it. Plus, you can order in food if you want. No bones about it, it's not a fancy trendy bar, but it's a good solid let's have an f'in no frills DRINK bar.", "author": "Kristen L."}
