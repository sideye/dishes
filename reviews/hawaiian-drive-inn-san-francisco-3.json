Everything here is a complete and utter bang for your buck bargain. Cheaper than an l&l or ono Hawaiian and it's located in a pretty busy part of the city. Also they hand prep/make everything in house. Mac salad is super fire always ask for one scoop of rice and 2 scoops of Mac salad. Can't go wrong with a large or small plate of katsu. Still come here at least 3-4 times a year to see what they are cooking like. This place has been a staple for me throughout high school and fed me well. My usual order is chicken mix plate (half bbq half katsu chicken) and a couple of spam musubis. Fyyuuhhhhh", "author": "Tofu S."}

FOR TEN DOLLARS. Yo, I think we have yet another winner winner, chicken dinner. Quite literally.\n\nThe mini plate came with rice, macaroni salad, a little bit of cabbage, and a whole LOT of tender, marinated chicken. Standard components of a mini plate, but they give you a much more generous portion than most other Hawaiian restos (you know which chain I'm talking about!). As tasty as the chicken was, the musubi, I have to say, was the stand out star. The spam/rice ratio was perfection and the nori they use? BOMB. It was thicker than usual and had a unique crisp quality to it. Amaze! And who could be mad at an ice-cold can of guava juice to wash it all down? Not I. No, not I.\n\nThis will be a staple of Vi's new neighborhood eats, you can quote me on that.", "author": "Vi T."}

The locations have different menu options and there isn't really consistency in how they cook their food.  The one in terms of food, is definitely one of the better ones.  But I will say in terms of cleanliness, and service it's not the best (not a big deal to me as I always get my food to-go, but if service and sitting down are your thing this probably isn't the best place for you.)\n\nI've tried a bunch of the menu items here including the Loco Moco, Teri Chicken, Steak, and Short ribs, Chicken Katsu and Spam Musubis.  The prices are pretty good and the portions are big.  The loco mocos are always really good because who doesn't love gravy?  But really all the menu items are good (except maybe the Teri Steak because it wasn't marinated long enough and they overcook it a bit.)  Aside from that, I definitely recommend a visit!", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

With a very serious (sardonic) woman taking the orders and grabbing the cash. It was my first visit to this FOUR STAR joint and I was kinda expecting a whiff of dat good ole \"Hawaiian Aloha Spirit\". Yooo know da kine. Nope. About as much Aloha Spirit as watching a meter maid write you a $65 love note for the parking meter that expired 15 seconds ago. \n\nA steady stream fans flowed in. BBQ short ribs & chicken combo w/ macaroni salad on a bed of coarsely cut crunchy cabbage. Piled in a clear plastic container with very wimpy plastic fork and knife.  Wrapped in a single tiny paper napkin the utensils posed an eating challenge; I looked around to see if this was the set of a hidden camera TV joke show. Nope. Thank King Kamehameha, they had chopsticks (on request only, since they are kept in a locked drawer beneath the closely monitored cash register). \n\nThe clump called macaroni salad, bore NO resemblance to its namesake. The chicken & short ribs were salty, chicken was tender (and salty) the ribs were quite sturdy (and salty). The bed of rough cut raw cabbage seemed to be the \"must have a veggie\" in the mix. White rice was overcooked (mushy), and no that is not Hawaiian style. Summary, for the price of 10 bucks I guess it is better than McDonalds, but it ain't Ono Ono.

Parking may be hard to find nearby. \n\nThis place is usually pretty busy especially around lunch time, usually I see one lady taking orders and doing the register while helping with the fryer and bagging orders while the cook handles the grill. \n\nThe service is usually pretty quick, but don't expect the lady to be talkative or friendly. I usually come here for their musubis - inexpensive ($1.90) and SO GOOD. Usually two will fill me up. If you only have five dollars on you, and you are in this neighborhood, this is the spot to go. \n\nChicken katsu musubi (4.5 stars) - The katsu is very crispy and chicken is very tender + yummy musubi sauce + rice - all wrapped in seaweed. Very comforting treat. DEFINITELY recommend eating this while it's still hot and crispy!\n\nChicken musubi (3.5 stars) - This is different from the katsu. This is bbq chicken musubi, pretty tasty but can be a bit too salty because of the sauce. \n\nSpam musubi (3.5 stars) - Just as described, it's a spam musubi. The spam is already salty and there is musubi sauce on top of that, which makes it even saltier. The rice gives your palate some balance but this is definitely not something I should be eating all the time.\n\nThey have many other options here, which I'm sure are good too. I've had the chicken katsu plate a long time ago and they came in big portions. They come with chicken katsu, katsu sauce, a couple rice domes and macaroni salad. \n\nHighly recommend this Hawaiian place on this end of Mission Street.", "author": "Amy T."}

For $5, you can get a mini portion that is actually massive- complete with white rice and macaroni salad.

Yah, I know...old news but that greasy butt that Kanye taps will forever be ingrained in my head.

They closed the restaurant for a few months in the beginning of summer and the place is super clean at the moment. It would be nice for it to stay this way for decades to come. It's also a nice to see a long time business to make an investment and keep their businesses open despite the high costs to run a business and the need to remodel, most businesses close because of the need to remodel. On the first few weeks when they reopened, the food tasted very bland and had no flavor. I just remembered that they replaced their equipment and the oil in the deep fryer tasted very new. I decided to wait a few weeks before coming back and the food tasted so much better. Think of the theory of a wok or dim sum steamer, they retain flavor of the previous cooking. I usually get their Chicken Katsu plate with all Macaroni. They don't charge extra if you want one type of side.

Kind of a random joint on Mission, and they're easy to overlook, but this little spot packs a big punch. They've been here for a while too. Back when I was in high school I used to buy their spam musubis all the time and keep them tucked away in my backpack for snack attacks. \n\nThe Chicken Katsu plate has always been the star of the show for me. Perfectly fried and breaded pieces of chicken, cut up into strips, nestled next to mounds of luscious white rice and a scoop of classic macaroni salad. A mini plate ($5) is more than enough food for me, but if you want to share or have leftovers, the regular size plate (~$7) is the way to go. Oh and that sauce they give you...perfect for dipping or as a gravy for your rice! \n\nI've had the fries and the chicken teriyaki, loco moco, and bbq short rib plates too and everything is delicious.  Not the healthiest of meals, but it's a yummy treat stopping by here every once in awhile. Only a few tables in the back and there really isn't much of an ambiance as it really is a hole in the wall, so I recommend taking your meal to-go!", "author": "Deanna Y."}

After some tough deliberation, I decided to try the Katsu and BBQ Chicken along with a Spam Musubi. \n\nChicken Katsu and BBQ Chicken Mini Plates were SO GOOD! The Katsu became a bit oily at the end but the BBQ Chicken was fantastic! VERY reasonably priced at $5 each. Way better than a 20 piece McNuggets!\n\nSpam Musubi was also pretty good. I might be crazy but I think the musubi sauce was a little on the salty side. I could probably eat 3 or 4 of these bad boys with a nice guava drink.

For those of you who know me and my penchant for Micheline meals, you may be wondering why I'm giving this place 5 stars, but the food here is DELICIOUS and it's ridiculously cheap so 5 stars. You go, Hawaiian Drive Inn.\n\nI actually ordered them through Waiter.com for work. Their menu is simple but extensive. There are a couple of lunch plate options, stand alone items like musubis, but I went for one of the meat dishes. Depending on if you get one or two scoops of rice, the price changes, but I got a chicken katsu with one scoop of rice and one scoop of macaroni for $4.99. Where in San Francisco can you find lunch for that cheap? Correct answer: no where. I tacked on a fried egg for an additional dollar.\n\nPortion size is HUGE. This is definitely Hawaiian comfort food at its finest. The quantity of food I got was easily enough for two meals, but it was so good I scarfed it down in half an hour. This place has some of the best chicken katsu I've ever had. I noticed that the katsu itself was a lot thinner than typical katsu where it's chicken breast meat and on the dry side. I doubt they actually used dark meat, but it definitely looked like dark meat--despite not having any sauce, the katsu was breaded perfectly, tender, and extremely flavorful. The macaroni salad as people have mentioned, is pretty darn good as well. There's nothing actually special about it, it just tastes good with the chicken katsu. I much rather would have preferred two scoops of macaroni salad than the rice, which is clumpy and pretty mediocre. But who cares if the rice is mediocre when the chicken katsu is so mindblowingly good? It's easy to have okay chicken katsu but spectacular katsu? That doesn't happen so often. \n\nSpam musubi was also pretty on point. They have a thin layer of sauce underneath the spam that really gives the musubi great flavor.\n\nAnd can we just recap that this entire lunch was less than $8 even after tax? \n\ntldr; delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price! yeah it's comfort food and probably not the healthiest meal.. but who cares? it's delicious -- go for the chicken katsu!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Sometimes they fry in batches, but only when it's very busy...otherwise you can be sure that it'll be prepared right in front of you. This pretty much guarantees that it's going to be succulent and perfectly crisp when you eat it. I also like that the breading is not very thick and that its a pretty hefty piece of chicken on the inside....unlike other places that serve katsu.\n\nThey do make party platters, hallelujah! I paid $25 for a small sized tray (like 9\" x 11\") of their katsu...called a couple days ahead and they had it ready to go, just fried when I arrived for pick-up. It was a definite hit among my friends.\n\nAlso, their macaroni salad is still hands down the best I've had.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I took the meat to other people to view and it's not safe for stomach to endured such old dark meat.  I have been coming here so many years but today is the my last day.  Also, if you notice your meat is not the same as it was 5 years ago. It's lesser and piece by piece from each portion. This is a reap off of your money.

They always come out deliciously hot and fresh. The mac salad is well-seasoned. It's not smothered in mayonnaise like some people do, and the macaroni is cooked perfectly. My best friend often gets two scoops of mac salad instead of rice with his order because it's that good.\n\nPass on the chicken curry and lemon chicken. The \"curry\" for their chicken curry was essentially their gravy with extra pepper atop boiled chunks of chicken, potatoes, and carrots. The latter is a battered chicken similar to chicken katsu, minus the panko flakes that make it crispy. It's served with a container of lemon sauce reminiscent of lemonade in both taste and consistency. The zesty lemon flavor was good, but the watery consistency felt and tasted strange to eat with the chicken. It'd have been better had it been a thicker sauce or glaze.\n\nWhenever I miss Hawaii, especially when the cold and foggy weather roll around, plate lunches from Hawaiian Drive Inn give me a deliciously comforting taste of home.", "author": "Tanya A."}

We all have those restaurants that we can always rely on and regularly get a craving for. Well, Hawaiian Drive Inn is at or near the top of that list for me! They have all the components of a great eatery! 1: The food is made to order! 2: The food is really well made! and 3: It's cheap!! For about $7 you can get a regular plate stuffed to the max with actual food. You won't get a heaping pile of cabbage like a couple other Hawaiian places I've been to. \n\nMy normal order is the Chicken Katsu (mini plate is actually a good amount, but regular plate if I'm feeling ambitious or sharing). The breading is perfect! When you bite into each piece, you get that really crispy outer layer with juicy chicken inside. The breading doesn't fall off very often here. I understand that it's a difficult/impossible wish to have the breading always stick to the chicken, but they do a great job at Hawaiian Drive Inn. You get 1 scoop of rice with the mini plate, 2 for the regular. No matter the size plate you get, you'll receive a large scoop of delicious mac salad! This location (franchised) has better sauce (somehow) than other locations. \n\nTheir BBQ mix plate here is pretty good. You get a good variety and pretty large amount of food, but this may be my 3rd or 4th best thing on the menu. I really like the Loco Moco. Good quality of beef patty with expertly executed eggs and a nice gravy! Yum!!!\n\nThere are a couple of other things I've had on the menu and I do want to try more, but I always give into the Chicken Katsu. Seriously...every time! I hype it up to all of my friends and never fails to amaze them! After the first bite, they're hooked!!!\n\nThey only have 4 small tables in the back, so most people take it to go.

This is good, considering it is cash only.\n\nI ordered the chicken katsu (chicken was a little sparse) in the mini plate (one scoop of rice and one scope of mac salad). Honestly it filled me up! No complaints, especially because it was $5! It is worth your money. My friend got the short rib in the mini plate for $5 also. Amazing. \n\nThe reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is because the place is definitely not the cleanest and it doesn't accept card. The best reasons to come here are because of the low prices on amazing options for Hawaiian food and they have big bottles of Sriracha!", "author": "Amy H."}

The last time I came here was on Halloween, where they were passing out candy for kids who were trick-or-treating around the area.\n\nFood tried so far:\n-BBQ chicken (small plate): I like it! Usually I request they remove the chicken skin but they already do that for you. I asked for brown rice but unfortunately they don't serve that.\n-BBQ chicken & broccoli (regular plate): Bf ordered this and he was satisfied. Plenty of broccoli and chicken, plus the mac salad and rice can fill you up.\n-Chicken katsu (small plate): crispy, and cooked on the inside. Not too oily and was great as expected.\n\nOverall: 4.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "description": "All my friends recommended this place to me and it was perfect since my friend and I needed take out and an extra plate for another friend. Anyways, we got there and I was faced with the most difficult decision: picking what I want. I never like ordering the same thing as my friends because I know I can just try whatever they have so it would be a waste of an experience. After strategizing for a little bit, my friend ordered a teri chicken plate, I ordered a fried shrimp and short rib seafood combo with all mac salad, and we got our friend chicken katsu with teri steak. \n\nBefore I get into reviewing the food, I have to say how amazing the lady who took my order is because I changed my personal order like legitimately 4 times and she accomodated each time without having to write it down to get it right. First I asked to get broccoli with my dish, but turns out I couldn't. Then I asked to get no rice and she asked if I would have all mac instead and I said no, but then I changed my mind and decided I wanted all mac. Then I needed to change one of the meats because I realized I didnt want one of the ones I accidentally said. She somehow was able to get the order change everytime without writing it down and get me my exact order at the end! She was totally chill about it too, so I really appreciate that she didn't blow up at me or anything because I was REALLY needy. \n\nAlright so down to the food!\nTeri Chicken - 8.5/10 - it was definitely not dry so that's what I look for first when I get something with chicken, I felt that it could've had a tad more sauce though\n\nTeri steak - 9/10 - I liked this one! It was really easy to cut through even with a plastic knife because it was nice and thin. It was delicious, the teriyaki sauce wasn't as needed here as for the chicken. It wasn't tough or dry either too\n\nShort ribs - 8/10 - I love short ribs regardless of the way it's prepared. The one's here were good, but I didn't feel that they were too spectacular. Also, the fat to meat ratio was like 1:2 which kinda sucked.. Of course you have to eat a little fat but not 1/3 of the portion..\n\nFried shrimp - 8.5/10 - It was fried!!! FRIED!! Anything fried is basically automatically DELICIOUS. I'm about to complain and praise the same thing right now, but there was so much of that fried shrimp that was not shrimp, just breading.. It was extremely delicious, the crunchy fried goodness where it was all breadcrumbs, but that's where I also felt it was lacking because literally only 1/2-1/3 of a piece was composed of shrimp...\n\nChicken katsu - 9.5/10 - definitely my favorite out of all of the one's I tried. It had the perfect chicken to fried ratio in my opinion. The coating was nice and even, until you reached the ends of course ;) the chicken was also super juicey. I felt that you definitely could've eaten it all without the katsu sauce but with it, it was just even more delicious. \n\nMac salad - 8/10 - good, not great, tasted a little bland but could've been because I was scarfing down all this meat at the same time hahahaha \n\n\nOverall, I definitely would come back for some take out and maybe try some other things on their menu. I saw that musubi was only 1.70 each! Hawaiian Drive Inn will fulfill your appetite completely because they don't mess with their portions. They give well more than you need and all for a really reasonable price. Service is good also, but just be prepared to hold your hunger in when you wait for your food because the smell is intoxicating in there!", "author": "Holly P."}

Quality of food is excellent and portions are a good size for the price. I LOVE their spam musubi. They also have katsu, bbq chicken and portuguese sausage musubi but I stick to the classic yet delicious spam for $1.60. I also love getting their bbq chicken and katsu mini plates. For $4 and something cents, you can get a small yet filling amount of food. I can never finish one mini plate in one sitting. I have also tried their spam saimin a few years ago. It wasn't bad either, but it seemed really simple to make (it's just spam pieces, noodles and soup. Nothing fancy.)\n\nI feel like with the amount of money they make, they could spice up the place a little to make it more customer-friendly. They could probably use a fresh paint job and a less jankier, less graffitied bathroom. Everytime I have to use their bathroom I feel like I'm in some alleyway about to get robbed haha. It's kinda cool how you can watch them make your food though, and when you leave you'll be rocking their mouthwatering hawaiian food scent.\n\nOh and did I mention the owner is REALLY nice?! He gives you freebies if you try chatting it up with him (bonus: if you speak chinese!) Or smile and say hello each time (because I don't speak chinese hahah) if you are a regular.

Hell, I'm over in Ingleside and I find that I barely make my way over to this stretch of Mission st. However, I will say that if you're the kind of San Franciscan or tourist who thinks that the city limits are confined to downtown, nob hill, mission, and and SoMa, you're going to miss out on some great eats.\n\nHawaiian Drive Inn is one of those cozy hole-in-the-walls you'll find along the southern stretch of Mission. Run by what appears to be the entire family (sometimes you'll find the kids running around), this establishments serves up some fine deep-fried and grilled Hawaiian fare that blows away chains like Ono and L&L. My personal favorite dish here is the loco moco. Cheap prices and generous portions. You will get TWO hamburger patties with TWO eggs and lots of rice and mac salad.

My favorite is the chicken katsu which I usually don't go for because of all the breading, but the taste is much better than other places I usually go to. Just make sure to open the container up a little or poke a few holes because the steam does tend to make the chicken soggy.\n\nThe burgers are good, but when the cook cooks the burger on the grill with a lot of other food cooking on the flattop, the burger tends to have a teriyaki flavor to it because of all the marinade that comes in contact from the meat on the grill.\n\nI usually take to-go here so I'm just going to base it on that.

That was actually Natalie Wood's last speech in \"West Side Story\", but it does seem a tad dicey on this part of Mission. And OK, the young customers - all male - weren't wielding switchblades....just cell phones. And head bandanas are so Rhoda. Gee, maybe I really was in the Castro. And nobody said \"Daddio\" or \"Cool\" or \"We're gonna have a rumble tonight\". Too bad because I know the words to \"Gee, Officer Krupke!\".\r\n\r\nIn my unending search for the perfect saimin in San Francisco, I decided to try this place and ordered the Aloha Saimin. Not bad, especially for $4.50, but nowhere near Hawaii-level sorry to report.  They were generous with the meat toppings - chicken and steak teriyaki slices and a fried egg on top. And actually the broth was not too salty either. But the noodles - the true deal breaker - were not up to snuff. They tasted a bit better than ramen noodles and were far too skinny to pass for saimin.\r\n\r\nMy friend ordered the far more robust Teriyaki Mix Plate for $5.95, where he got a generous portions of the chicken and steak teriyaki as well as a couple of Korean-cut short ribs, all on top of a mound of rice and surrounded by another pile of macaroni salad and cabbage confetti. It was good and hearty though the macaroni concoction was rather bland. One point does have to be deducted for the open bucket of raw meat within viewing distance of the counter. Hide it, will ya?\r\n\r\nIt's really more like a lunch counter. There are only four little tables in the back, but everything is lit up like a Wal-Mart. Oddly, you actually don't pay when you order but when you leave. In fact, the owner actually brings the food to you at the table.

Everything came with rice and macaroni salad, and was about $4 each. \n\nThe curry chicken tasted weird because of the texture of the meat. We couldn't decide which part of the chicken it came from, since it was cut awkwardly and tasted a little chewy. \n\nThe chicken katsu was incredible and large in portions! Crispy... oh, so crispy. This is the katsu I think about everyday at work! The mac salad was a little plain compared to the katsu (after you dip the sauce). [oh, I learned that chicken katsu had the katsu sauce on the side, and chicken cutlet had gravy sauce on top]\n\nThis place is TINY, only about 3-4 tables.

It's a hole in the wall and although they have a couple tables in the rear I've always done take out. It's tough to beat this place because the quality of food is on par with the other hawaiian places, they're extremely affordable (approximately $7 for their \"entrees\"), and they give you a lot of food for your money. The only downfall to this place is they're cash only but that's kind of expected at a place like this. If this is your first time going I'd suggest getting the chicken katsu dinner or getting the combo plate, but make sure to pick chicken katsu as one of your 2 meats. If you're not that hungry then they have burgers too for around $4 or so.

I'm the type that can chow down on pretty much anything but this was one meal even a garbage mouth like me can't shove down. \nI work in the restaurant industry and while standing in line, I cant help but to notice all the unsanitary practices. I can name a dozen of health code violations, but I'm only going to list the most important ones that a restaurant should be mandatorily forced to comply with in order to be \"serve safe.\" \nViolation 1. Cross contamination of cooked food and raw food especially CHICKEN! I watch as the lady take a box of raw breaded chicken out of the fridge and put it in the fryer with her bare hands, then immediately touch and handle cooked chicken without gloves or washing her hands.  \nViolation 2. No gloves and no hand washing! Not only did she touch the cooked food after touching the raw food. She is also the cashier, which means handling cash and handling food interchangeably. Furthermore a man I assume just came back from his break because he came from outside of the restaurant and I watch as he went straight back to work without washing his hands. There is a sink with the sticker of all the hand-washing procedure, but there is no soap dispenser anywhere near the sink so I'm gonna guess that hand-washing is not a common practice at this place. \nViolation 3. Unsanitary work environment. This place was a mess! If I was them I would not put the cooking area in the front of the store where everyone can see your mess! Clean up once in a while to keep your work area clean and clutter free. \n \nI would have just walked out of this place but I want to give this place a fair chance, beside my GF was on my ass and she is not a happy girl when hungry. LOL \nNow lets get to the food. THE FOOD IS DISGUSTING!!!!  It's pretty hard to fuck up steamed rice, macaroni salad, and fried chicken katsu, but this place managed to do so. If you have any decent skills as a cook those things are a no brainer. The pork chop, bbq chicken, and loco moco are all pre-made and sits in the hot station, which mean they are not cooked to order and not fresh. The cuts of meat is really cheap and comes with mostly fat. The chicken katsu is brown instead of golden. The only reason they give you so much chicken is because they pound the shit out of it to make it super thin so you get 4 piece of finish product with only 1 reg size chicken breast. To keep prices low the quality of product should not be the one that gets cut. After not finishing my meal I got the SHITS. -_- not surprised. \n\nI don't understand why this place has so many 4 star and up reviews. Maybe only high school kids and busy workers come here for a quick and cheap lunch. I will not be coming here again. HEAR MY WORDS.

You can smell it anywhere within a 1-block radius, which makes me staaarved whenever I pass by.  I have to admit that for the first few months living in the area, I ate here way, way too much because the portions are so huge, the prices are so cheap, and the teriyaki chicken is just THAT GOOD.  I've finally developed enough willpower to NOT go in and order Hawaiian every time I smell it.\n\nTeriyaki chicken is boring, you say.  Yes, every Asian place seems to serve teriyaki chicken, even if it's a freaking Chinese restaurant, but Hawaiian Drive Inn's teriyaki chicken is not overly doused in an overly sweet, corn-starchy sauce - the seasoning's barbecued right in, as it should be.  The chicken is nice and tender, salty enough and won't make you need to deep-hydrate afterwards - and the broccoli as a side (which I occasionally order to make myself feel minutely healthier) is actually steamed well, with just enough flavor.  Macaroni salad is hit-or-miss for most people here, but I tend to like it because it doesn't outright choke me in mayonnaise (although it's probably just doing that sneakily).\n\nSentimental neighborhood favorite for me.  For others, like I said, can't go wrong with the barbecued meats, musubi, or chicken katsu, but stay away from the curry at all costs.  It's your normal S&B but with inedible chunks of unidentifiable meat in it.  I'd probably eat the chicken katsu more if I weren't so Chinese about not eating too much deep-fried foods because of \"yeet hay.\"\n\nBe warned:  you WILL leave this place smelling of barbecued teriyaki deliciousness.", "author": "Christina H."}

We had 3 people (including a very hungry teenager), and we ordered the chicken katsu and the bbq mixed plate, and it turned out to be more than enough, especially considering the generous piles of rice and macaroni salad they come with.  \n\nClearly, the Yelp consensus is that the chicken katsu is awesome, but what exactly is it?  It's basically just breaded chicken strips, only zillions of times better than the frozen kind.  Who knew those could be respectable?  BBQ meats were all great too.  They brought us a little container of sauce but it wasn't nearly enough.  I don't know if you can get more for free, but you'll definitely need some if you want to cover all the meat and rice.  The macaroni salad has potential, but it really needs less mayo and more zip.\n\nIt may not be the same as eating in Hawaii, but it's nice to see that SF has even this relatively obscure cuisine covered.  (In fact there's another Hawaiian place across the street...could there be a whole Hawaiian food scene here that I don't know about?)  In short, portions and prices are great, and with more sauce and better mac salad they could probably be the Mitchell's of Hawaiian food.  After all, it's only a matter of time before one of these dives puts the Excelsior on the [foodie] map.", "author": "Wes M."}

I ordered the seafood combo with Deep-Fried shrimp, Mahi Mahi, and Teri Chicken ($6.80), and my wife had the combo with Chicken Katsu and Teri Short Ribs for around the same price. The main draw here seems to be enormous quantities of food for extremely cheap prices. The quality varied quite a bit, but we definitely found some winners. The Teri Chicken was excellent (at least as good as Da Kine), and I would definitely order it again. The fried shrimp were also excellent. The mahi mahi was dry and kind of stale tasting, and I robably wouldn't order it again, altough I might try the mahi mahi sandwich (for $1.95, how can you go wrong). Maybe I just don't like Hawaiian stlye fried mahi, because I didn't particularly care for it at Da Kine either.\n\nThe short ribs were decent although I would probably try the Teri Steak or Pork Chops before getting the short ribs again. The Katsu was dry and a little fatty. I would definitely stick with the Teri Chicken in the future.\n\nThe rice was well cooked and they give you a ton. A mini plate is likely enough for any normal person. The mac salad, on the other hand, was slathered in mayonaiise and pretty tasteless. I would probably opt for extra rice and skip the mac next time.\n\nEasily 3 stars, possibly 4. I will definitely go back, if only for the ridiculously low prices. I look forward to trying some other menu items (the Teri Steak looked good on the grill, and I want to sample the saimin), and will update when I do.\n\nI would say Da Kine might be a bit better (and they have pearl drinks), but the overall value at HDI28 is superior.", "author": "Brian H."}

The servings are huge and you can feed yourself for just a few $$.", "author": "Michael M."}

SOLD to the highest (erm, albeit cheap) bidder! aka ME! they had this $3,99 special that included your choice of burger (they had a few to choose from, including a mahi burger!), small (but they looked big to me) fries and a drink (i picked a can o' coke). my cheeseburger was fresh off the grill and very simple. no frills, no special sauce, just a bun, some mayo, a slice of cheese and fresh grilled goodness. the fries were nice and crispy and again, abundant for a small. me? quite happy and satisfied. i'll try the mahi next time.", "author": "ray e."}

Unable to resist the smell of deliciousness coming out the open door, she brought home a mini bbq chicken plate for us to sample and I've been hooked since!  10 years later, the bbq chicken is still my go-to order, but the chicken katsu, mahi mahi, bbq beef, and bbq mixed plate are all equally yummy.  I always take mine to go, but there usually are people who eat at the small tables in the back.  Parking can sometimes be tough, so do what I do: call in the order first, park at the bus stop on the corner (hey, if the cops can get away with doing this while they eat their burritos at El Farolito, then I can too!), and then run in to pick up and pay.  In and out in under 2 minutes ... just in time to get out of the way of the next bus!
