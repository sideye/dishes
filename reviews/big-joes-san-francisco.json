I love the french toast and went through a long phase of addiction to it!\n\nBut one thing that really sunk my experience was that they'd constantly be getting phone / internet orders. There'd be a huge line out the front, people inside waiting for their breakfast, and for service like checks and coffee, but the whole kitchen (and front of the house as well) would be slammed cooking food for people who weren't actually in the restaurant.\nPeople would be starving, getting cranky, and watching the kitchen work like mad but it was taking way too long to get their food.

We were seated right away. We ordered coffee and water and the waitress that was helping us was very sweet. \n\nWe ordered the Eggs Benedict and Big Joe's breakfast burrito. The food came out pretty fast and hot. The eggs Benedict was forgettable and I don't really recommend. The ham slices were thin and for some reason they added a slice of tomato to it that we picked out. I'm also not sure if it's because they poach their eggs in water with vinegar but the slices of ham had a sour taste to them. \n\nThe Big Joe's breakfast burrito was alright. It was more of a lunch dish than breakfast. Most of the filling was the seasonal veggies (which I think it was mostly zucchini and a little mushroom) and egg. I wished they used a little more turkey or bacon. The green salsa it came with was also very spicy. \n\nAs we were paying, a party of 16 tried to find a table. That's almost the entire restaurant.  The place is very small and if you're bigger than a party of 5 or 6, I'd say pass or try calling ahead first to see if they can accommodate.", "author": "Junella T."}

Warrior posters, and pictures of classic SF stars and sports teams. You'll get a greeting from a charismatic local with a loud voice which makes you feel right at home. The modern diner style feels almost stereotypical from the shows and movies you'd see. The gentlemen that runs the place was as friendly as could be. He offered us free coffee and chatted with us about where we were from and what was good on the menu. \n\nMy favorite go to breakfast/ brunch food are the classic eggs benedict's and hash browns.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-03-18", "description": "I was super disappointed with my experience today. It was so incredibly disorganized, and I left really wishing we chose somewhere else to spend our weekend breakfast trip. \n\nWhen we got there a few people were waiting, so we went inside to get our name on the list. One chick behind the counter told us she'd be with us in a few minutes because she needed to clean a few tables, so we said ok and stepped outside so we weren't in the way. Nobody came to put our name on the list and several tables got up and left, but they don't have a busboy so the busy servers had to clean the tables. It's too much for them and seriously took for ever!! One lady finally came outside to call people on the list, but she was so flustered that it took forever to organize who sat where, and I had to remind her my name wasn't on the list, but we were before several people on it. \n\nWe finally got a table and they took our order quickly. Great. But then we had to wait FOREVER for our food. Everyone around us got their stuff, and they had been seated around the same time, and we sat waiting for at least 30 minutes. My husband started to get a headache because he hadn't eaten yet (we arrived around 10:45 and it was 11:35). When we finally received our food it wasn't even worth it. Super average and the eggs in my omelet were over-cooked and almost hard. It was the Spanish omelet and I wouldn't recommend it at all. The flavors did not go together and the salsa wasn't great. I also didn't care for the dressing on the salad. The only thing I really enjoyed was my latte. My husbands spinach and egg sandwich was pretty bland too.\n\nThe servers meant well, but they're asked to do too much and their service suffers because of it. Our server even said that she usually likes to take drink orders first and then return for food orders, but since we had to wait so long she wanted to take everything at once. She said that same thing to at least two more tables, and she shouldn't have to. If they had an extra set of hands all of this could potentially be avoided. And they knew we waited forever for our food, even acknowledged this when dropping it off, but did absolutely nothing about it. \n\nWe will never be back, especially since the food wasn't that great.", "author": "Steph L."}

The berry butter, was great on top of the pancakes.\n\nAs for the experience, probably not gonna go back here. Service was really challenging. The restaurant consisted of probably no more than 3 tables for groups of 4, and probably a couple more tables for groups of 2 and a counter for another 5. I noticed 3 servers and 1 child, probably the daughter of the owner. I guess my biggest gripe was getting a glass of water. I asked for a cup of water from waiter #1, and I never got it. I asked waiter #2 and still no water. I asked the child for water and then finally I got it. Then our food came, I ordered an all meat omelette with home fries. There was nothing special about it but it's ok since the pancakes definitely was worth the meal.\n\nThen my cup of water was empty. I asked waiter #1 - no water. Waiter#2 - no water. I saw waiter #2  bussing the next table to us so I asked him again, he seemed annoyed when I asked him again. He said, yes I'll get it. And surprise... Still no water. I'm like what's so hard about remembering to fill up a cup of water? This place isn't that big for no one to go around to fill people cups.\n\nDefinitely not going back, yes just because of that.\n\nOh another thing. I wanted to order French toast, the waitress said that they were sold out. While eating the table next to us talked toa other waiter and they said they never got the French toast they ordered. They said that If they haven't cooked it, cancel it. The server said that they haven't made it but if they wanted they can make it to go, I was flabbergasted..

The truth is there isn't that much to patronize along this quiet stretch of Monterey Blvd. except a smallish Safeway, which makes a place as bustling as Big Joe's stand out even more. It's actually a tight fit in here where tables are crowded together with just two booths where parties of four can dine comfortably. Much to the pleasure of the staff, I sat myself down at the otherwise empty counter.\n\nBecause I had no one to chat with, I kept perusing the Yelp app to see what fellow foodies recommended. A weekend-only special, the $10 Big Joe's Egg Tart was getting a lot of kudos, but I have to admit I was not in a quichey mood. Maybe kitschy but not quichey. While momentarily considering one of the breakfast ciabatta sandwiches, I went very low-key and ordered the $9.75 Turkey Spinach Omelette. It was a standard diner treatment with the egg immaculately squared off and none too fluffy with a split toasted English muffin on the side.\n\nIt was still satisfying with plenty of turkey inside and the spinach wrapped on the outside almost like Greek dolmas. The fresh mozzarella was actually placed on top instead of melted inside, perhaps to prove that it was indeed fresh cheese. The best part of the plate may have been the home potatoes, which although perfectly cubed, was searingly hot and nicely seasoned (photo: http://bit.ly/1PI8Wlq). Now those, I would have ordered to go if I had room. A solid staff kept the energy up in this compact space as did the undeniably smooth coffee (photo: http://bit.ly/1JtXDJV).\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...omelette was a bit generic but the potatoes and coffee are aces\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a tight fit but no one was waiting...counter seating wasn't bad\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...service was pretty attentive and the food didn't take long to arrive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...solid coffee shop vibe makes this a viable daytime option", "author": "Ed U."}

I've been here twice and left feeling satisfied both times! The service is always exceptionally friendly and i've never had to wait for a table.The ambiance is like a diner and they have a bunch of sports memorabilia on the walls which is pretty cool to look at while you're waiting for your food.\n\nI've tried the chicken pesto omelette, the veggie hash with eggs, buttermilk pancakes, and egg & cheese sandwich with ham. Of all the dishes i've tried, my favorite is the buttermilk pancakes. They are super fluffy and they also come with a delicious strawberry butter that has real bits of strawberry in it! Also, you can get a half stack (just 1 pancake) instead of getting two. I also really liked the egg & cheese sandwich that my boyfriend ordered once, but unfortunately it didn't have avocado like it says on the menu. :( That would've definitely made it better!\n\nOh, and you get a free coffee with yelp check in!!", "author": "Tara A."}

If I could, I'd rate this place with negative stars!  It was a busy Saturday.  They had to start a list of customers on the back of their receipt booklet to make sure everyone was seated accordingly... Lots of yelling from the waitresses as to who is taking care of which table, who should be seated next, who took care of the togo orders, which table ordered what food as it was coming out of the kitchen. It was a VERY unorganized day for Big Joe's.  The manager on dutie wasn't much help with trying to get the place flowing as it should.  \n\nOur food took FOREVER!  My husband had to go next door to the coffee shop to get a snack for our kids. We thought about leaving, but we walked to Big Joe's to have brunch and didn't want to have our kids wait again for food.  What's even more disturbing,  a customer came in as we were finishing up, seemed to be the managers friend, he was treated with better service than everyone else.  He wanted the door closed, and the staff made it happen.  Bad move cause it got stuffy quick.  Its a very small restuarant.  This customer waited maybe no longer than 10 minutes to get his food WTF!  We waited close to 45 minutes for ours.  To top it all off, he wanted his food cooked a certain way, and they made it happen.  I guess its really about who you know...\n\nI probably can keep going, but I'll end here.   We definitely won't be going back to Big Joe's.  Oh wait the quality of the food, wasn't all that.

It was understandable but it did slow down the service. It took her awhile to take our orders and for our food to come but I didn't mind the wait since I wasn't too hungry. \n\nFood:\nI got the Big Joe's burrito and he had the brioche french toast. I ended up eating more of the french toast than my burrito because it was that good! The cooked pear and walnuts gave the french toast a good texture and a sweet/nutty taste to it.

We got there right before the rush and we watched the line begin to build. The staff was very friendly and gave great recommendations. I did notice one thing that could be an issue. While we were there they ran out of orange juice, french toast, and another menu item. This was weird as it was only 11:00 am. Besides that it is a great diner type restaurant with good food. I can highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich and the pancakes. Also, try to get a seat at the counter the staff is very friendly and you seem to get a little bit quicker service.

The worker there was very inviting, and it seemed like other patrons of the store really enjoyed his company.\n\nMy friend ordered the Brioche French Toast, which basically is French Toast with brandied peaches, pecans, mascarpone cream, and berry sauce ($9.00). I wasn't sure what to order, but what really caught my eye was the buttermilk pancakes with STRAWBERRY BUTTER($8.00). I've never tried that and since I'm a sucker for strawberries i thought, why not. It also had a lemony compote and maple syrup.\n\nThe serving portions are pretty god here. I didn't get to try my friend's order but i liked mine. The pancakes were nice and fluffy, and the strawberry butter was quite unique. It was a spread with strawberry bits and it just tasted really good :-) and the lemony compote added a nice zing to it also.

Big Joe's supplies all of this at a great price and friendly wait staff.\n\nLocation is right off of Monterey. I can imagine parking being a little tough, but strolling in a little after 1:30 on a Saturday, was able to to find a spot right in front. We were seated right away and ready for our meal. I decided to order the Egg Tart as per pictures making it look delicious.\n\nWith a casual debate over what the difference is between an egg tart and quiche (I concluded it was due to the size), I dug in for a bite. The tart was nice and flakey, while cooker thoroughly through. The one egg on the side was best placed on top of the potatoes to let it run through. I mean, that was the plan except my egg-lifting skills were obviously put into question that day. \n\nA definite follow up is needed to try some of their other great offerings on their menu. The egg tart was just an appetizer to the next time I come by and try out their breakfast menu again.", "author": "Eric L."}

They were also very gracious while doing all of it. \n\nI ordered the chicken & pesto omelette with the mixed greens. The salad and omelette were both delicious! I was very satisfied.

So...naturally I would want to give them high marks for friendliness and customer service....but I will let you folks judge that yourselves.\n\nThat being said, my review is based purely off the quality of the food and the condition of the place...\n\nBig Joes is a typical San Francisco neighborhood spot. It's small with not much parking nearby...so obviously a locals joint. \n\nThough small...the layout of the place affords maximum use of room and feels larger than it should. It is also one of the cleanest places I've been...compared to everywhere in San Fran.\n\nBTW, as an aside...one of the main factors I look for in determining how clean a place is...is through the condition of their bathrooms. If any restaurant can't maintain a reasonably clean restroom...which is visible to the public...how clean are the conditions of their kitchen where only staff sees? In my mind...clean toilets=probably clean kitchen, dirty toilets=food borne illness dirty kitchen.\n\nAnyway, Big Joes has a clean restroom.\n\nSo...the food. Sitting at the bar next to the kitchen, I could see their chef cooking everything. The kitchen looked very clean...and all the food was prepared quickly and all looked delicious. And...one of the first things I noticed was their chef knew how to make an omelette! One of my biggest pet peeves are places that serve omelettes overdone...which causes the eggs to get rubbery and dry. You shouldn't rely on the ingredients to keep the omelette moist! Big Joes chef cooked the eggs to just before being completely done...added the filling...threw on the cheese...expertly folded the omelette and pulled it off the grill just ever so slightly underdone! \n\nNow for those of you who cook...you know that food after coming off the heat continues cooking from residual heat for awhile. In this case...when my omelette arrived...less than a minute after being removed from the grill...it was reaching a perfect doneness! The eggs were perfect...the sausage and bacon filling was wonderful...it tasted great! I was also served some home fries...which were creamy and soft but with crispy edges...and seasoned perfectly.\n\nAnyway....give Big Joes a try!", "author": "Richard J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-22", "description": "Yeesh.\n\nWe arrived before 11 a.m., which is a small miracle for me on a Sunday. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table.  BJ's is teeny-tiny, with not a ton of space to wait. We ended up scoring two seats at the counter.  It's now c. 11:10 a.m. PDT.\n\nHere's where things get ugly.  \n\nA male server comes by and asks us if we want something to drink. We ask for two coffees and two waters. We never get the coffees or the waters. The horror. The headache. Ten minutes pass, and a different female server comes by. She asks us if we would like something to drink.  We ask for two coffees, two waters, and one orange juice (because we noticed it at another table, and it looked yummy). She gets confused and asks us if we want one orange juice or two. We clarify that we want one. This time, we get two coffees, one orange juice and no water. Our previous server notices that we never got our beverages and mentions that they were out of coffee at the time we ordered it, which is why we never received it. BJ's: you are a breakfast place, you cannot be out of coffee. \n\nIt gets worse.  \n\nIt's now 11:20 a.m. PDT. We place our order. For me: Breakfast burrito with bacon. For him: Breakfast sandwich with chicken apple sausage. Two waters. We notice that the two couples (one with screaming child in tow, for bonus points) that have come in after us have now been seated. We still have no water. Ten minutes pass. Twenty minutes pass. Thirty minutes pass. We have not received our order. Forty minutes pass. And still no food. The couples sat after us have received their orders. One table has a breakfast burrito, pancakes and an omelet. The other table has eggs benedict and a Spanish omelet. In the meantime, the female server has knocked into my chair serving other tables about 152 times--without apology. \n\nIt gets worse. \n\nMy boyfriend is way less patient than I am, so he asks where our order is and notes that the two tables that came in long after we did have already been served. The male server tells us that the cooks were probably just getting the \"easier\" orders out of the way before tending to ours. Really? I think a breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich are far easier orders to cook than eggs benedict or a Spanish omelet. I think what happened was that our server forgot to put our order in. We have now been waiting 50 minutes for breakfast. Not cool. Without alcohol: super not cool. The male server offered to take care of our coffees, which were already free because we checked in on Yelp, so he took care of our orange juice. When you wait 50 minutes for breakfast at a place with under ten tables total, a free orange juice is not going to cut it. You trippin, boo.  \n\nIt gets worse.\n\nThe kitchen slaps our order together. It looked like Ray Charles made my boyfriend's breakfast sandwich. My rush job burrito was similarly underwhelming. Nothing was seasoned or dressed appropriately. My side salad was deluged with dressing. My boyfriend asked for aioli--he received a ramekin that was about 1/4 full of aioli. \n\nOur female server was cleaning the table behind us, and she rammed the chair from the table into my boyfriend's seat. You probably shouldn't seat people at the counter if you're going to ram into their seats 152 times. It's just not cool--I think I have whiplash now.  \n\nWe asked for the check. Our female server, who has been completely oblivious to us the entire time save for smacking into my seat 152 times, brings us the check without taking care of the orange juice or coffee. Maybe she was on Lyrica. I have no idea. We asked the male server to adjust the check, which he did.  \n\nThe Silver Lining. \n\nOur male server was very apologetic and tried hard to make things right--I just don't think he had the authority to do so. Our female server?  She's on Lyrica, I think. And the orange juice was delicious.  \n\nI'd like to think this baffling experience was an anomaly, judging from all of the fantastic reviews this place gets, but man alive, it was the worst dining out experience I've had in a long time. I don't think we'll be back. I don't think my back could take it. Pass.", "author": "Sunny S."}

My bf and I called to order food and pick it up for to go. When we called the store, the lady was soo soo sweet. We ordered everything, unfortunately they dont have fries. We ordered an omelette, hot turkey bacon sandwich, and a pastrami fondue sandwich. My boyfriend ordered it, picked it up, when we got home, I took a look, and it wasn't that appealing. i tried it, not much flavor nor savoriness to it. Nothing was outstanding, and we were pretty disappointed by the taste and food. I've had pastrami sandwich, one of my favorites is actually from Pinole fosters freeze. I never really liked pastrami until I tried their sandwich, mix in the cheese and some mayo plus veggies- HEAVEN. The pastrami here was not crispy on the edges, large amount of meat tasting like ham. The turkey was bland- wasn't that great, needed more mayo and sauce, or some sort of flavor. The swiss cheese on the turkey made it more bland- i suggest adding American cheese. Overall I wouldn't go back again to order the food there as I didn't enjoy the flavors of it.", "author": "Amy Y."}

I am kind of a yuppie though. *shrugs*) I like this place and appreciate that it's not overrun by techies, hipsters, yupsters, or other forms of gentrifiers. Most of the customers are families with grandparents, young children, or both. The vibe is your good ol' neighborhood diner: small, clean, big on Bay Area sports (which you'll pick up on pretty quickly from the decor), and serving up healthy to hearty brunch food. Lots of omelets, breakfast burritos, sandwiches, and vegetarian options to choose from. The egg tart is a weekend special that is nice and unique--think of if a quiche and the crust of a fruit tart had a baby. The standout to me here is the strawberry-infused butter that comes with the pancakes and french toast... YUM. Pro tip: add a half order of pancakes or french toast to your savory breakfast if you are feeling extra ravenous. The service is pretty friendly and attentive, especially to regulars. Since there's not a lot of seating, there can sometimes be a short to medium wait on the weekends. But you definitely won't be waiting up to 2 long hours like you would at some of the \"trendier\" brunch spots in the city (\"trendy\" because they're usually boring and not that great). At Big Joe's, you can expect good, delicious food without the nouveau SF pretentiousness. A breath of fresh air in this beautiful city. So come out to Sunnyside sometime!

When we were there, there was only one waitress and one cook, but everything came out in a perfect time frame. \n\nI had ordered the Turkey Bacon Melt with potato wedges, and let me tell you... IT WAS TO DIE FOR! My first bite in and I had felt like I was in heaven. I came in thinking I wanted to eat a classic breakfast (pancakes, eggs, etc), but I'm sure I made the right choice. The size of the melt was bigger than what I expected. I'm a girl that's known to have the capability to out eat a lot of people, but for once, I was intimidated by the size. By the time I had already eaten half of the melt and half of the potato wedges it came with, I was close to being stuffed. Although I was starting to get full, I just didn't want to stop eating because that's how delicious it was. So, I finished the entire melt, leaving one or two potatoes.\n\nThe service was wonderful. The waitress(didn't get her name) was very kind and always smiled. Even though she was alone, she was very attentive! I was very satisfied with our service. She even helped us find our way around!\n\nI would definitely go back. It was just an overall amazing place.

Both times the delivery situation has been a mess. The first attempt I will accept part of the blame. I was using EAT24 and didn't realize this place was set to pickup by default. In my defense no one else does this. When I called to try and clear up the mistake I was told to that Big Joe's uses a delivery service and that I needed to sort this out with EAT24. I contacted EAT24 and their solution was to cancel the order. All because somehow the restaurant and the delivery service aren't working together? How hard would it have been to give my food to the delivery service with my address? Instead EAT24 refunds my order and Big Joe's needless prepared a meal for no one. \n\nSecond order looked more promising. I ordered and received a text about 45min later saying my food was on the way. When the delivery arrived it wasn't my food. I told the delivery driver that this wasn't what I ordered, he walked off and said contact the restaurant. Having already been down that path I contacted EAT24 instead. They contacted Big Joe's and Big Joe's told them they'd send out the right order. They never sent out the order. \n\nAgain, the food looks great.

It was seriously smaller than a fast food burger and the bun was crumbly and falling apart, it did look like quality meat though. The fries were really good, wedge-cut and tossed in spices with a garlicky-kick. The plate came with a dish of what looked like homemade mayo but I was scared it could be old mayo lol... So we steered clear. In hindsight it was prob super legit homemade.  \n\nHere's my problem: our bill came to just short of $16 for a tiny burger, a canned soda and a cup of coffee.

That may be one of my biggest pet peeves when I dine out.  I ordered the reuben/pastrami and it was delicious, just wish it was bigger.  It also took FOREVER for the food to come out.  The people next to us ordered eggs and I watched them wait 30 minutes, complain and the waitress apologized before it finally came out.  I think my meal took around 20 - 25 minutes to come out, which for a little brunch/casual spot, is too long in my opinion.  Also, they don't have free wifi.  I asked the waitress and they claimed to not know the wifi password.  Overall, food was very good but it lacked it almost every other area.", "author": "Joe S."}

I asked the server if we could take a $1 off and he said no problem, that he was actually going to comp our two cups of coffee, which was the more generous thing to do since that amounted to $5. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because whoever owns this place doesn't appear to make good decisions.\n\nWhile this place is small, there was just the one server doing everything from greeting people to taking orders to making coffee drinks to clearing the tables.

The coffee was excellent - hard to find coffee that has such a smooth, rich taste. \n\nMy order arrived, hot - which can be a challenge for many places believe or not, and it just looked good!  That first bite just confirmed it tasted even better than it looked - the eggs were cooked with the pesto combined, unlike just a pesto sauce thrown on after.

It also came with avocado and I was pleasantly surprised.

My girlfriend got the egg Benny and it was made perfect, the flavor was all there from the sauce to the eggs being cook to perfection. It was partnered up with simple but flavorful potatoes. I had the big joes burrito and it was everything you can ask for, and the sauce that comes with it was a true Mexican sauce that any little old Mexican gram would be proud of. We also had a half order of pancakes and a small portion of the most amazing French toast I've had in so long.\n I can't forget about the serves, we got lucky to get served by the owner and that man I'm telling you he was the best server I've had in such a long time. He gave me hope that the FOH can still have great servers that care about you're experience. He made us feel like we were at home just relaxing with wonderful food. To top it off he's a true local that shows pride in being a local that understands how wonderful this city is. \n  I say go to big joes and enjoy a wonderful local breakfast that gives you a warm feeling inside. \nP.S: if you haven't noticed I will be coming back and I will be sending everyone over there to have the same wonderful experience I had.", "author": "Antonio C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-11", "description": "I can really see the intention in the place, but the quality of the food just fell flat for me. We came here on an early Saturday morning. There were a lot of people with their small children and a lot of people who seemed like regulars, so that was a good sign, but the service was a little chaotic. They were preparing things for a catering job they were doing, so they were bringing things in and out of the restaurant (and it's a small space). I didn't mind it so much because that's just part of how they make their living, but I could tell there were other patrons who were more bothered by it. \n\nAnyway, the food:\n\nEgg Tart: the crust was tough and flavorless. The interior needed some pizazz of spice or something and I thought it was odd how I was eating an egg thing topped with an egg. \n\nhalf order of Pancakes: they were pretty fluffy, but got soggy after a while. I have high standards for my pancakes though. I really have yet to find pancakes anywhere that I love, so I think I have to continue the search.\n\nVeggie Hash: Good, but salty. This was definitely the best thing we tried that day. \n\nThe coffee was only refilled once and only one water glass was brought out and I drank my whole water without it being refilled. I wanted to like Big Joe's more and I could really tell there was a lot of intention in the place. The menu was cute/had a nice design and the place had a fresh coat of paint.

I had the chicken pesto omelet and my girlfriend had the tomato basil soup and bacon n eggs. My omelet wasn't huge which I'm glad. Some breakfast joints have omelets that take up a whole plate and I hate that. I don't like to waste and I don't like leaving half an omelet on my plate. Her soup was really good and her bacon was cooked well. Not burnt or limp. \n\nThe chef brought us out complimentary pancakes. We were sceptically because neither of us like pancakes! It would be an insult not to try them so we did even though were didn't want to. But..... these were flippin' awesome! Fluffy and not heavy. When your finished with them you don't feel like a gallon of batter is sitting in your stomach. We paid $26 including a $6 tip.

A few months ago Big Joe's was bought by a young, local family so I was interested to try it under new management.  My family had breakfast at Big Joe this morning, and we couldn't be more excited about having such a great neighborhood dining option.  The new owners, Adrianna and Peter, have completely redone the decor and brought it into the 21st century.  \n\nFood:\n- The menu is completely overhauled and focuses on organic, fresh ingredients.\n- I had 2 poached eggs with home fries, bacon and toast.  The eggs were perfectly poached, the home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the 3 slices of bacon were thick-cut, crispy and delicious, and even the toast was tasty.  All for $10.\n- My wife had the spinach and egg breakfast sandwich with avocado and tomato.  I didn't taste it, but she raved about it.\n- Our daughter got a fruit cup for $2 that she was thrilled with.\n- The highlight, though, was the coffee.  Unlike most diner cups of coffee, their coffee is dark, strong and really hot.  Adrianna explained that they spent a lot of time selecting their coffee (an organic Mexican blend from Chiapas), and it shows!  Big Joe's may be my new morning coffee spot.\n\nAtmosphere / decor:\n- The new decor and layout is warm and inviting.  Very family and young kid friendly.\n- Adrianna came by multiple times to chat and tell us about her family, her adventure into restaurant ownership, decisions about menu items, etc.\n- The restaurant still has the feel of a diner / local eatery, but is very clean and very inviting.\n\nThey've only been open for a couple months, so there are a few \"new restaurant\" kinks that I noticed, but nothing significant that they won't work out.  Overall we were very happy with the dining experience and value, and we're thrilled to have such a great breakfast / brunch option so close to our house.", "author": "Aden B."}

Im sorry, but sitting at the counter eating while there are customers and a customer waiting is a bit much. Take it out back! \n\nLast time I came here, we were a group of three. By the time the waitress came over and took their orders, we were still waiting on our aforeordered coffees. No refills and 30 minutes later, my two dining partners got their food. Me, not being surprised at this in the least suggested they go ahead and eat. 5-10 minutes pass and I am still sitting there with no food, while they are nearly done. I got no explanation to go along with my no coffee refill either. When I finally stopped the waitress and told her to cancel my order, I got the explanation that the grill was broken but he was working on my sandwich now. I said \"I dont care, these guys are done, I dont want to make them wait for me now.\" \n\nShe went in the back and told the chef, whom I could hear was quite angry and I left a little happier, knowing that they were just about as pissed off as I was. \n\nAfter that, though and before we could get out, they failed the maths on the bill and tried to overcharge us by $5.", "author": "Adam L."}

I ate everything because I was hungry and I wasn't about to waste my $15 breakfast tab. However, it was a very disappointing experience.\n\nI ordered the vegetable hash with 2 poached eggs. Despite the fact that I was the only one in the place, it took about 15 minutes to get my order. The eggs were so runny that they had barely been cooked. The whites and the yokes ran into the salad dressing and made one mixed mess. \n\nThe orange juice was so sweet that it was like a sugar soda. It tasted as if they poured sugar into it to stretch it. There was only 1 piece of toast with the hash. I eat breakfast out frequently and 2 pieces of toast are usual with these expensive SF breakfasts. \n\nTo top it off the wait person presented me with a portable tablet to charge my meal on and left. I had no idea how to use this. I couldn't get a proper PAPER receipt for my records. I had to give my email or phone number, which I do not like to do, to get a receipt. And even then I won't get a receipt, as I don't have a cell phone. I finally got the page from his order book as my receipt. \n\nI live nearby but would not return.

Most of the food was never great, fairly bland, (and the potatoes are usually always undercooked and not seasoned with anything other than salt/pepper,) except a few good things like the french toast and pancakes, but we could walk there from our house and everyone was nice. The service went way down hill and after a series of bad experiences, we decided to take a hiatus from Joe's. We've now attempted several times to try them again, but to no avail. The lines are ridiculous - as is the case with most places in the Bay now, which is unfortunate b/c there are so few places actually worth the wait. Last Saturday we decided to bite the bullet and wait in line b/c it was my birthday. We put our name down on the list and there were only 2 parties ahead of us. Within minutes, 3-4 other groups of people arrived and put their names down. We waited half an hour and everyone else was seated, except for us. My boyfriend went in to ask and when they took the list out, our name had been crossed off and neither one of the new waitresses wanted to own up to their mistake. We were so angry, we left. My boyfriend still wants to give them a chance, but I will never go back. \n\nThe owner is super nice and I'm so happy he's doing well, but sadly, I will no longer frequent this once friendly neighborhood spot and chat about the Warriors with him.", "author": "Talia S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-10", "description": "Welcome to amateur hour at the breakfast joint.  \n\nGot there just after 1 on a Sunday. The place was full but we waited less than 5 mins before being seated, which was a nice change from all the SF brunch places that require at least a 30 min wait before getting in.  Boyfriend thought it was a bad sign that the restaurant was full but no one had any food... he was right.  We waited 45-50 mins before food was served.\n\nI genuinely felt for the waitstaff.  The gals were really nice and very attentive. They kept apologizing for the long wait, telling us it wasn't typical to take so long, and kept the drinks refilled and eventually comped drinks for us and half of the other tables because of the delay.  The reason that waitress gave for the long wait was a \"large to-go order for 6 burritos.\"  I kinda wish she wasn't so specific because it highlighted that the kitchen clearly needed help prioritizing and lacked the experience/ability to put out food at a pace necessary to successfully run a dining establishment.  Seriously though, if an entire restaurant full of people is waiting for food because of one big order maybe they shouldn't do takeout. \n\nBoyfriend got bacon and eggs, which was good but nothing special.  He really liked their homemade habanero hot sauce.  I got the french toast with poached pears which was really fluffy and tasty, until I got some of the dollop of mascarpone on top which was either old or not stored correctly - it had gone sour.  Another symptom of the kitchen not having its act together.  I wasn't about to wait for a new plate so I just scraped it off, but it ruined what was otherwise damn good french toast.  The bad mascarpone was unforgivable, and what pushed this review into 2 star territory.  I would given 3 stars otherwise even with the ridiculous wait.", "author": "Marina O."}

Which I'm sure is what they are going for. The staff is friendly, the environment is warm, and the place is decorated in Local sports teams with the TV on in the background. It felt like a visit to my father's, Very home-y and warn in, and the food and service reflects that. \n\nIt was our first time. The hostess let us sit anywhere he liked.  I got the pancakes and my girlfriend got the breakfast carne asada burrito. It took a while to arrive, but I was having good conversation with my girlfriend while sipping their ridiculously good coffee so I didn't mind. Probably the best coffee I've had at this type of restaurant, strong and bold, not watery at all.  If you go alone, or you can't hold conversation, this might not be for you. The food arrived and despite the potatoes being a little bit too close to room temp for my taste everything else was perfect.  Without a doubt the fluffiest pancakes I've has in the city, and the most natural tasting. Every other place seems to be on this ginger spice gimmick. and while that's not a bad thing, sometimes simplicity is the way to go.  \nThe burrito was great as well. One of the more satisfying I've had in San Francisco. Felt a lot like a real burrito and didn't follow the strange San Francisco trend of using rice. It was simply meat, cheese and potato. \nSpecial orders weren't a problem and was even suggested and off menu hot cocoa with added coffee.. the results were amazing, and he even served us the surplus instead of draining it as spoilage.  \nThe best part about this place too is it's not over crowded with hipsters claiming its amazing like Mama's(which isn't that great), or Dottie's.  It was nice, easy going, spacious, and comfortable. \nThe only thing keeping it form perfect five is hotter temperature food,  and expedience. just a little. \n\nI'm gonna be real with you.. The hype about SF is a lie.. unless you have ridiculous amounts of dollars you are NOT going to easily find an affordable place to have a good tasting experience. This is one of the exceptions that won't break your wallet.", "author": "Vinny T."}

It's like grandma's best apple pie with a soft, delicious vanilla ice cream floating on top. Except better.

We walked in around 11AM on a Saturday and expected a line out the door but found only 2 others in the restaurant.  Oh-oh, I thought, what does this mean?  Hubby braved on into the place to try the food.\nThe pearl Jasmine tea was nice with our breakfasts:\n1. Egg tart - $9.  A 3-4 inch tart (didn't so much like the crust but the filling was good) topped with a cooked soft fried egg.  Inside the tart were slivers of leeks, bacon,egg.  Very good.  You have a choice of a green spring salad with vinaigrette or cottage potatoes.  I had the salad, didn't taste enough tang in the dressing, but I'm glad I got the greens because Hubby got potatoes with his breakfast and I wished the potatoes were more browned and crispy,\n2. Eggs Benedict was one of the specials of the day. If they offer it on the day you go in for breakfast and you enjoy this dish, you shouldn't miss it. I like a tad more lemon in the sauce but the dish was very good (came with potatoes or greens). Under $9 for the dish which many places charge so much more.\n\nThey have breakfast grab and go - like a breakfast burrito.  Great for folks on the run. \nSaturdays they open at 8AM and close by 3PM. \n\nThis is a great place for SF Giants fans (we are!) because the walls are decorated with lots of Giants pictures and the place is painted orange and blk.  The hostess told us her husband likes the Giants (owners just opened the place on Halloween last yr) but there are other sports teams (49ers) pictures on the walls.\n\nThe owners are really sociable, friendly and try hard to please.  I'm torn about writing to tell others about  small businesses which serve good food. I don't want to see the place get swamped with lines but at the same time, I'd like to see them prosper, do well financially so I can come back.

There's nothing I hate more than a restaurant the sells over priced food because they claim it's \"good quality\". And that's the exact reason I created a yelp account: because big joes claims that everything is organic and local and I think it's important for potential clientele to know what they're getting themselves into. Since their kitchen is so close to the eating area, I noticed that the products the cooks were using were not organic in the least. \nThe food is good but not worth the way I felt after being cheated out of my money.\nAlso, the last time I came in, the service was subpar. \n\nVery very disappointing.", "author": "Marry L."}

I think there's a pizza joint as well, but it reputation is so poor I've yet to try it out.  Thank goodness for Joe's #2 (what happened to #1?).  It's a small hole-in-the-wall joint.  I can't lie - the menu and hours are somewhat limited.  I'll tell you what though; the burgers and service are excellent.  During my first visit, I didn't realize that they only took cash.  I ask the waitress/cook/manager/owner if there's an ATM close by.  What does she say?  \"You pay me whenever.  You new.  Sit down, read paper.\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure I've ever been told I can pay whenever.  I felt like I just had flashed back to the 1950s.  Or at least what I imagine the 1950s to be like... \n \nShe proceeds to get me a paper, take my order and delivers me an excellent bacon cheeseburger.  After eating, I went to the ATM and brought some cash back to her.  She says, \"I told you, pay whenever!\".  She almost seemed disappointed that I paid her back so soon.

We generally don't like to complain, but no one asked why we left most of the OJ or left half of the omelet either.

Anyway, I had the eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes. For some reason they put sliced tomatoes on it, but I just removed them.. The hollandaise sauce had good flavor but my dish arrived cold. The potatoes, however, were great; crisp and not greasy at all. Delicious! My husband had the pancakes and they were to die for; light and fluffy and the strawberry butter was awesome!

Making things even better was the service (friendly) and price (less than $5). I told the lady helping me the burger was going to be dancing fuel, and if it worked, I'd be back the next day for breakfast.\n\nBurger consumed. Dance floor rocked. Back for breakfast.\n\nSame friendly lady helping me. She is clearly the face of this operation, with her husband acting as burgermaster. Or the brunchmaster.\n\nMy meal wasn't anything inventive, standard eggs, toast and potatoes, but what they lacked in originality they delivered in accommodation. Egg whites no charge. Grilled country spuds instead of fried hash browns. Very minimal oil as requested. Wheat toast.

My friend thought her cappucino was very good. Overall, it's worth a visit, and is comparable to Tyger's or Higher Grounds in Glen Park Village.

You can tell the place is growing in popularity by the fact that you might have to wait for a table on the weekends, which i did not have to do a month ago. The food is pretty good and the menu is basic, but has some interesting twists. I feel like my potatoes are always undercooked, but the rest of the food is good.", "author": "Ben M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-26", "description": "We went for breakfast and had the eggs Benedict, Spanish omelet, and spinach & egg sandwich. The eggs Benedict and sandwich were good. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict was very flavorful. It had a hint of a lemon tang which gave it a nice twist to the usual eggs Benedict meal. The Spanish omelet was a little bit of a letdown.  Not so much an omelet as it was eggs with salsa on top. The home potatoes, however, were really good - crispy and not very greasy at all. One  thing that erked us is that we checked in to take advantage of the free coffee, but the server, for whatever reason, hesitated when we he gave us our bill and we asked if he could apply the offer to our meal. Not a huge deal-breaker, but still, a little bit of a deterrent. Price-wise, I would have to say overpriced. 3 meals, 2 orange juices, and a coffee came out to $44. Food was good but not gourmet. Clean location in a neighborhood area so parking wasn't a headache.", "author": "Aaron V."}

The decor is painfully sad, the place is tiny and the bathroom is like the one from The Goonies.  BUT, this is the best place for breakfast! The french toast is incredibly good. Amy is the best. The service is fast. Kids are liked there which is very cool. Breakfast for 4 under $20 is my kind of place.", "author": "Molly W."}

If you order a sandwich, the server will give you a three-part serving tray with filled pickled relish, onions, and mustard so you can dump as much of it as you like on your plate.  Great omelettes and burgers!", "author": "Rick E."}

The waitress Amy, is super friendly and pretty cool to talk to. I always feel welcomed by her and she makes the eating experience great.\n\nTheir breakfast food is okay...but what really makes this restaurant rock is their burgers. Seriously, their hamburgers are so tasty and juicy. I always end up ordering two, because they are that good! Their filet of sole is also fantastic. The quality of the food is always consistent and the prices are reasonable.\n\nTry their lunch menu... Big Joe's won't disappoint. .", "author": "Ace C."}

The burgers are great and they serve up some screamin' breakfasts for those hungover mornings i don't feel like cooking. The prices are very cheap too.

The waitress is friendly, the food is decent, and the place is clean. The hours could use updating. Although...they're now open after 3pm for dinner. I think the waitress told me they come back at 5pm. I had a hamburger with mushrooms and onions with fries. My BF had the same. The tab came to around $22 with tip. We didn't order a drink. That seems a bit high for two burgers with onions, mushrooms, and frozen fries from a bag versus fresh.", "author": "Christian D."}

If you are in Glen Park or near Monterey  Blvd. and you want some good, cheap diner food before 3:00pm,  Big Joe's is pure NICENESS. The lady who owns it is super kind. She's one of those people who is so nice you think she's being a smart a$$, until you see her treat everyone that way and you're like this fu@k!n RULES. Now I'm not saying she'll try to be yer best  friend, but she is very polite and attentive. It feels good when I drop my dollas at a joint where they appreciate it. This is one of those places. The menu is standard diner food with some daily specials. It's always tasty and served right. I prefer their burgers. They let you garnish them however you like which for me is a nice touch. All the onion and pickles I want ensures a fatty tip for the Lady who runs a great spot in an outta the way part of the city.", "author": "santiago g."}
