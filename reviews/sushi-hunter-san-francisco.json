I stopped by to get an Udon to go, so my 3 star rating is more of an incomplete than anything else!\n\nAs soon as I walked in I was struck by the decoration. I will not be exaggerating if I said that it is something out of the 60s or 70s. It took me a while to adjust! With that said the young lady who greeted me was very nice, took my order and asked me if I would like anything while I wait. I asked for a green tea that never materialized, but I didn't care since I was not really craving it!\n\nThe Chicken Udon arrived in about 10-15 minutes. I must say that it was very nicely wrapped! You know how it is? You get an Udon to go and by the time you get home half of it has spilled in the bag! Not this time and that is a good thing because it was very tasty and hit the spot for me.

So we came in and confirmed again and they said yes.  \n\nFood was okay although she kept getting our order wrong and then kept telling me that i was wrong.  So odd since I knew exactly what I ordered.  It's all you can eat anyways.  We just wanted to make sure we didn't waste any food. \n\nThen bill took 10 min to come and they decided to charge us $18 a kid vs $15.  We asked and they said well the menu always said $18 for kids 5-11.  We looked at the menu and pricing for kids was nowhere to be found.  \n\nThen she took 20 more min to deduct $6 while arguing that well the price was there before as if we were supposed to know that from a menu she no longer has.  It was the oddest experience to have such petty incompetent service and response.  \n\nWe used to like coming here.  Now it's off our list and I hope it was worth it for them to do this for $6 just so they want to make sure to tell us they were right, even though nothing is printed anywhere.  \n\nThey lost our trust and therefore hard to also trust the quality of food.

We made a reservation for 8pm, showed up 5 minutes early, got our table immediately. The waiter helped us out in ordering food for our first round, as we were all unsure what to get.\n\nLike others have said, the food was good but nothing special. My personal favorite was the Crunch Roll, and there were a few other good-tasting rolls out there (Wild Fire roll, Rock'n Roll). But the rest was meh. I despised the maki and the nigiri wasn't too tasty, which left a lasting impression.\n\nThe service was good for us -- the waiter would come by to take our plates and orders whenever we finished a round, brought more water frequently, and were helpful in general.\n\nI am disappointed by the price, however. For $30 AYCE, I expected more. $30 isn't even accurate because they add tax and then the 18% gratuity. So for 6 people, $180 AYCE becomes $230, meaning we all just paid close to $40 for decent AYCE sushi.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back here again without trying out (or at least reading through more reviews of) other AYCE sushi restaurants nearby.", "author": "Rahul R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-30", "description": "Sushi Hunter seems to have a philosophy of \"cheapness\" pervading their whole business... except for the bill, that is. The interior looks minimum-decoration-required-cheap, their furniture feels high-school-cafeteria-cheap, and their rolls taste I-could-do-this-better-cheap. And judging by their attitude, I don't think the staff is too thrilled to be working at a restaurant where even they wouldn't eat the food.\nBut let's get one thing straight: this is a lower tier sushi restaurant with an all-you-can-eat option, which is the only reason I stepped foot inside. You know as well as I do that all-you-can-eat sushi at $27 per person (+18% gratuity, did ya catch that one?) is not the kind of sushi that will send you home happy. It's the kind that will send you to the bathroom unhappy.\n\nOnce you've agreed to this common understanding, you can at least take comfort in the fact you will be stuffed silly by the end of your meal... Or will you? We desperately tried about every option available to us, hoping to land a winner. Plate after plate of small flavorless rolls. How long will you last? Can you eat your money's worth? At Sushi Hunter, the value of the all-you-can-eat is wholly a question of your mental endurance rather than physical. Good luck, you'll need it.", "author": "Stephen C."}

It all started with the server who brought us water and a single cup of tea. The thing is that we didn't order tea so we were confused. We asked if the tea was free and she nodded so we thought sure why not free tea. It took a while for them to give us the menu and also took longer for them to come around to take our orders. After we finally ordered, the server set a bowl of edamame on our table. We didn't order edamame so we asked if it was free. She said yes so we helped ourselves. Little did we know they were in fact NOT free. When the check came, they charged us for all the things that they said were free. In the end, the manager gave us a cash refund after we pointed out the mistakes on the bill which I'm giving it a one star. Adding another star because she helped take a group photo of our party. \n\nFood didn't have much flavor and the presentation was below average. Portion was small.

The speed of order to receiving the food was similar for the next few rounds. My tea was also regularly refilled. Went about 5ish rounds, and at next \"ordering round\" when I said I think I'm ready for the check, the waitress even politely asked \"are you sure?\" in a nice fun manner. I laughed and went for one more order for \"dessert\". \nTotal was $27.00 for AYCE (Mon-Thurs) and $1.00 for the green tea. \nThe first 2 rounds of tuna seemed slightly room-temperature and not as \"firm\". Probably was the remaining pieces of a large piece that had been sitting out from the refrigerator for an hour or so. Not bad, just noticiable. However by round 3ish (7:30pm-ish) the tuna was definetely a colder firmer one, which were good. \nOverall, for $30ish non-buffet style AYCE sushi in the city, I liked it and will definetely be coming back, espcially now that Monster Chef in Half Moon Bay is only open Fri-Sun.", "author": "Alvin N."}

Price was higher than acceptable, and food was very much below standard.\n\nTheir AYCE sushi menu gives limited choices, at least compared to what I'm used to from AYCE. They had a larger than usual roll selection (which isn't even appealing), but not nearly as many appetizers and you'd expect - and even more limited in seafood appetizers.\n\nTheir crunchy rolls were good, but in general had too much flour (too much crunch). Beyond that, the rolls were mediocre, and forgettable.\n\nAppetizers were standard, tasted decent. Teriyaki chicken was lacking flavor, but props to good Gyoza.\n\nTheir salmon nigiri was quite nice, but that is the only nigiri I would recommend. The eel nigiri is alright, but feels old and overcooked, and the lean tuna nigiri is terrible (rubbery and chewy). The squid nigiri (or whatever the white rubber is) was absolutely the worst piece of sushi I'd tasted in that USA. I couldn't finish it. Some watery oily liquid filled my mouth when I bit into it. In hindsight, I should have complained.\n\nThere are no free desert options, so my friend and I opted for tomago nigiri. This was a mistake. Also couldn't finish this piece. Had to pay 2$ each for the kochi ice cream (which was tiny and hard, not mochi like at all).\n\nThe worst part is - the tip is pre-calculated into into your bill. THAT IS NOT A TIP, THAT IS A MANDATORY FEE. Ended paying 40 per person, when AYCE in Waterloo gives you a significantly more fulfilling experience for 22USD.", "author": "Ben Z."}

Ordered 2 soups; one came shortly after, the other came halfway through the meal. Ordered a few sushi rolls and one of the rolls was missing half its adervtised ingredients. Asked for it to be replaced, which they did and brought out a wrong order along with it. Our Tempura starter also did not arrive till the end of the meal. Food quality- worst sushi I've ever had. Seaweed was stale, the roll was all rice, did not taste fresh and we only ate half of what we ordered. It was definitely basic and barely edible. We asked for the bill and they have an automatic charge of 18% grat. Don't know how you can justify that when you bring out wrong orders, starters at different points of the meal, and the food is barely edible.

This has got to be the worst restaurant I have been to in my entire life in terms of service and food. I ordered the all you eat sushi. Service is nonexistent and the waiters never check up on you. When you do get to order, half of the order is missing because they are apparently \"unavailable.\" The orders are never fulfilled so make sure to order more than once if you make the mistake of eating here. When the owner feels like you ordered enough, she will tell you stop ordering. This owner is an epitome of the cheap Asian stereotype. Why have an all you can eat menu if you're going to have a nervous breakdown every time we force you to take our order? I thought it was funny how the owner took all the menus and left us with just one for 5 people to share every time we asked for more menus from other servers. The sushi was abysmal. The sushi was drier than beef jerky and rice was horribly old. I expected some decent sushi as SF is literally next to the ocean but didn't expect too high of a quality as it was an all you can eat place. Boy, I was wrong!

One word describes them perfectly: TERRIBLE!! First of all, Sushi Hunter, being an AYCE option restaurant, I didn't expect them to have good quality fish; This time I just cared about the quantity of the food. But what I got was not even half of the food that I have ordered, and rude remarks from the manager/owner (old Asian woman, I don't know her name). \n\nSo my friends and I ordered from a younger looking server. After over 30 minutes of wait (we actually timed them), the food still hasn't arrived. So we tried calling the server who came after like another 15 minutes, and asked where our food was. And after checking with the kitchen staff, she said we didn't order anything else. When we told her who we ordered from, she told us we were being rude and that we can just order from her right now, so despite her rude attitude towards her customers, we ordered more food (we paid around 40 dollars each, so might as well get as much as we can). However, of the many things we ordered, what we received was not even half of our order. When we called her over to ask her if the other half of our missing order was on its way out after waiting 20 minutes, she told us, it was not available, which would not have been a big deal, except for the fact that she refused to let us know when we ordered those things (we ordered the unavailable items 2 different times, thinking the order just didn't go through, only to find that we were never told that they were unavailable so we ended up waiting so long for food that wasn't even available!). When we told her that we were waiting so long for items that were unavailable because we were never informed that they were not there, she told us it was not her fault and that we need to stop complaining because she was working the best she can (So rude! she was yelling at her customers paying for service and telling us to stop complaining!)\n\nFinally, we just let it go and ordered a few more different things from the menu and again, the wait time was incredibly long. When we got the order, the rice was so hard and tasted as if it was stale and old! wow.. I don't get why some other people posted that fish were fresh. Fresh fish, clams, and other seafoods don't stink. They obviously didn't try FRESH food. \n\nCustomers complain when they feel that what they got was not their money's worth. That is exactly how I felt yesterday. This is my FIRST time posting on Yelp, just warning the readers what to expect if they might even think about going to this place.\n\nSUCH LOW QUALITY FOOD AND SERVICE!

Most dishes are spicy or fried. Those are usually red-flags for sushi that is substandard in attempts to cover it up with oil-boiling or veggie heat. \n\nThen I sat down. The service was absolutely on-point. The staff moves with purpose and is very attentive (while not obtrusive). I felt like I was back in Japan again where one's own self-worth is at least partly tied to how you treat other people. The edamame was perfect and *might* have even been steamed not microwaved. The seaweed salad could have ended the evening - the material itself was fine, it was just doused in substandard sauce - until the roll arrived.\n\nThere began my re-evaluation.\n\nThe rice of the roll was was well-steamed and sticky. The fish tasted fresh and firm. Everything's was on-point again except...it was too spicy. Like not even a little bit too spicy...but a lot.\n\nThat's when I realized they might not be frying or spicing things to cover up the taste, but because they think San Franciscans want their sushi that way.\n\nLook San Franciscans have lots of foibles - we're overly feely, poor social experimenters, etc - but we know food. We're not afraid of sushi. It doesn't need to be spicy or fried. We just want fresh, quality ingredients.\n\nSo I'm gonna give Sushi Hunter a 4-star, not for what it is, but for what it could be. To be fair, without the promise of change, I was gonna give it a 3.4 anyway which *almost* rounds up. This place is right on that tipping point. If they stopped making spicy/fried food and just started making fresh sushi - with the skills and material they clearly already possess - they could be one of the better sushi joints in the city.\n\nAn upgrade to the interior wouldn't hurt, but again, I hold out hope.\n\nWorth a visit to form your own conflicted opinion.", "author": "Christopher M."}

My friends visiting from out of town were persistent about finding an AYCE sushi place, so we decided on Sushi Hunter. I called at 6pm on the 30th and made a reservation for 6:30pm, the girl on the phone was very nice. I showed up around 6:20pm and was seated promptly. It was not super busy which was nice. The environment is OK, the walls are painted bright blue which is a somewhat bright color for  dinner ambience. The place is small, so I imagine the brighter color helps the room feel bigger. \n\nThe service is mostly why I'm rating 5 stars (but don't get me wrong, the food was great too). I've worked in the service industry in the past for many years, so I am very critical of my dining experiences. I didn't catch the name of our server, but she was extremely attentive, knew the menu well, helped me with a recommendation, and made sure we had everything we needed. Any extra plates, dishes, napkins that were taking up space were removed in a timely manner. \n\nMy date and I ordered off the a la cart menu and our dishes came out very quick - we took part in the happy hour and ordered 2 alaska rolls ($6 each) and 1 spicy tuna roll($6), and then ordered the specialty Lion king roll. The Lion King roll ($15 was charged, though I thought the menu said $14) differs from place to place and I have to say their Lion King is my favorite of all the other sushi restaurants I've been too. I really enjoyed the Chicken Karrage happy hour appetizer ($4) which was extremely delicious (the batter was nice and crispy and the meat was very tender), a miso soup($1 Honestly not my favorite miso soup, but very delicious) and the Wakame Salad($3 I LOVED the salad, though its pretty much the same everywhere) as well. We spent $53 including 2 hot teas. \n\nOur other 2 friends ordered the all you can eat - one vegan/vegetarian and one with meat. I talked to them yesterday and they still feel full :P The AYCE takes longer when you order alot of things, so they recommend ordering only 5 things at a time. It did take their dishes much longer for ours to come out, but their dishes always featured alot of items. \n\nIf this place was more convenient to get to, I would make a point to come here more often. When I am in the area craving sushi, Sushi Hunter will be the top of my list. Thank you Sushi Hunter for a great dinner! :)", "author": "Courtney T."}

The sushi isn't extremely fresh but for a cheap price, it can't get any better than this!!! The seaweed salad was a little too sweet but it's ok. Chicken teriyaki was right portion for me.

Soy sauce teapot holder was suppperrr cute hehe :) Staff welcomes you right when you come in and waiters are attentive as much as they can. Anyways, if your not too picky about your sushi and have a little more patience, then affordable AYCE is the spot!!! AYCE on the weekdays, if you pay cash is $25 per person. If you pay credit then it's $27/person. There's an extended ayce menu but the $25 is good enough. I will mos def come back... yay!!!", "author": "Sharmaine M."}

But I'll preface this by saying I've been completely and utterly spoiled by Toronto and its mecca of AYCE sushi places that defies logic, both in terms of price (soooo cheap), quality (soooo good) and quantity (this menu is how many pages long and they're ALL included in the deal?)\n\nAaaanyway, Sushi Hunter is a decent offering for a city with very few AYCE sushi restaurants. The service was super friendly--they actually asked us to move mid-way through our meal to accommodate a large incoming party, and gave us plenty of plum wine on the house to compensate. The decor is pretty minimal and a tad tacky in terms of lighting, but spacious enough that you could easily have a big group and not want for space. \n\nThe food? Here are my thoughts:\n\nAlaska Roll - Rice could have been better and salmon was a bit...soft....but overall satisfying.\n\nPhilly Roll - Not too much cream cheese. That's a good thing.\n\nRock 'n' Roll Roll - My friend's choice. It wasn't bad, but eel does very little to excite me.\n\nWild Fire Roll - Spicy salmon and cucumber. Such simple things bring such great pleasure.\n\nHamachi and Salmon Maki - My two favorite fish in an AYCE setting. Yeah, we ordered a lot of this.\n\nWakame - LOVED! Chewy and perfectly marinated. My friend hadn't had a lot of wakame before and she actually asked if we could order more. Why yes, hon, I believe we can on account of this is an AYCE place!\n\nChicken Karaage - Is there any food the Japanese don't do well? Fried chicken is manna from heaven. Period. This was pretty good. Not super oily with tender meat.\n\nIt's best to come here with a large group (e.g. friends' night out, birthday party, etc.) and just order everything on the menu that catches your fancy. Sushi is obviously very shareable, but most of the other menu items are too, so it's a great \"family dinner\"-style place.", "author": "Josephine L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-08-17", "description": "A very mediocre sushi restaurant. The AYCE (all you can eat) option seems like a great deal but they put very little fish in their rolls for this deal and it only includes the most basic rolls and kitchen items, speciality rolls are a separate cost. Furthermore, they automatically add 18% gratuity to the bill because they know that they wouldn't get tipped since the service is so crappy. They watch you trying to stare them down and continue to talk to each other and laugh behind the counter until you finally go up and talk to them to order more. I believe they do this so the food settles and you get fuller off less food and they save money but they add the gratuity to the bill so they can get away with this without losing their tip. Only once in the hour and a half that I was there did they come back to refill my water and ask how I was doing and this was at the very end of my time there. Poor service aside, the fish is subpar and it's comparable to the premise sushi you can buy at Safeway.

They also only gave us half the stuff we ordered and when we noticed that everyone else that came after us already got their food, we asked them and they said they forgot the other half so we didn't receive it for 30 minutes.\n\nThey need at least one or two more people working here. They stopped another customer while they were talking to go pick up the phone.

I don't eat on site typically, so I'm not sure about service, but their TOGO service is prompt and ready when they say it will be.

So after we grabbed the attention of another waiter we wanted to verify that the rest of our food was coming, especially since the table next to us got here after us and got a HUGE platter of sushi before the rest of ours came out.

The sushi is good (not great.. Rice not tightly rolled, also we're in the Bay so it better be good) but the service detracts from any desire to come back here.

The menu was, unlike other places, full with tons of choices from appetizers to tempuras, teriyakis, nigiri and rolls, all included in the $28 (on weekends, $25 during the week) order.  The sushi, we were relieved to see, was not 90% rice with a hint of fish, it was the appropriate amount of rice to the fish portion, which admittedly was smaller than a piece by piece order, yet none-the-less tasty, fresh and well presented.  We ordered a little, ok, a lot from the above categories and ended our meal with mocha and green tea ice cream.  We loved the selection, the freshness of the fish, the flavor of the cooked items and the atmosphere.  \n\nI left off the 5th star because we all felt the service was a bit lackluster.  The restaurant is served by Chinese women who did not exhibit a passion for their jobs but performed adequately anyway.  I asked about some additional options but if it's not on the menu don't bother, they were always \"too busy\" to accommodate and yet in spite of the above we had a delightful evening, good food, great value and we will be returning again to sample more of their delights.

The all you can eat is a good deal at $30 bucks considering it is San Francisco. The menu was on the small side with not a huge array of rolls but enough for 3 people to try something new each time. ANOTHER PLUS is they have choices on appetizers and a few other things that is included with the all you can eat. If you want some of the more popular and complex rolls or hand rolls you will have to fork over another $15. It was slow for a Friday night because of some rain so our service was charming and attentive. The one thing I didn't understand was we didn't have a server both girls where taking our table so we where checked on maybe too much. Plus I like building a connection with the people that serve me and value there opinion, it seemed like one of our servers knew the menu really well and had a lot of great suggestions but the other might have been new. \n\nIn any case it was a nice find probably won't be back anytime soon just because I feel like I have tried everything on the menu with the all you can eat.", "author": "Jennifer F."}

The walls are washed a cool blue, the bar glows, cute decor, and the music was bumping.  Unfortunately, the dining experience was average and not as wow-worthy as the restaurant itself.\n\nMy two friends came for the AYCE experience, but I was not as hungry.  The unwritten rule here is that all individuals in your party have to order AYCE.  However, since the restaurant was so empty I was able to order a bento dinner and skirt the rule.  \n\nThe selection and quality was average.  My bento contained curry tonkatsu, saba shioyaki, and negi hama (yellow tail and green onion).  The curry on the tonkatsu was bland and the meat, poorly breaded.  Saba shio made up for it though - quite tasty!  And the negi hama was nothing to rave about.  \n\nMy counterparts on the AYCE menu had many items to choose from, but since we're talking AYCE you have to maximize the fish and minimize the carbs to get your money's worth ($28/person).  They were able to find enough favorites to be stuffed silly!  :P  \n\nIf you ask me...these rolls, nigiri, entrees, and appetizers do not compare to my favorite AYCE sushi place in Daly City - Kome.  The sushi is fresher, the rolls are SPECTACULAR (and huge), they have tons of seafood, dim sum, etc at a lower price of $22.95/person.

For less than $30/person, you can get all you can eat sushi and appetizers.When I arrived at Sushi Hunter, I was wary at first because the restaurant was almost empty, but I guess I just arrived early because within an hour it was completely full with a line of people waiting. The sake and beer wasn't as extensive as my friends, who also came to drink, not just eat, would have liked, but they decided on a cold sake that the waitress recommended and they loved it. \n\nThe appetizer menu was awesome and had a lot of traditional Japanese appetizers and small dishes. We ordered the dumplings, shrimp tempura, edamame, and seaweed salad. Everything was good, except the dumplings which were just okay in my opinion. As for the sushi selection, they had a good sized list of rolls, however, I thought many of them were pretty similar to each other- a lot of rolls that were \"spicy\", such as several \"spicy tuna/salmon\" rolls. Not too much originality all together, but they may have had more on the regular menu (not all you can eat menu). The rolls we did get were really delicious, especially the NB roll, that was my favorite. \n\nThe service was a slow, even at the beginning, before the waitresses were busier, but I think that can be expected sometimes at all you can eat places to keep you from eating more. Overall, great buy if you want to pig out on sushi and japanese appetizers.

Decided to come in on a friday and to my shock and pleasant surprise they were packed! They'd always had trouble filling the place up so I was genuinely glad the place was doing well. We asked about how long the wait was and she said we could go next door and grab a drink and t leave my number and she would text me.\n\nUnfortunately, that was where the pleasantries ended. After two drinks at Square and no text we came back and a different lady was working the front. She informed us they don't take numbers and text people and acted like I was crazy. Luckily the same girl that told us to leave the number popped by and offered to sear us but the original lady was super rude. We ordered the all you can eat menu, which in the past has been good. I realize the all you can eat items are going to be a bit smaller and a bit rice-ier for lack of a better term. But i wasn't ready for the horrible service and terrible food we got. I ordered a fried spicy tuna roll and from a cross section it was 95%+ rice and the alleged 5% tuna wasn't red at all it was orange from all the spicy sauce (mayo and sriracha) they used to cut the tuna down further. Hell I'm not even sure it had ANY TUNA in it. \n\nThe ultimate Insult beyond the low quality food was when the bill came. Party of four with all you can eat and fed a bunch of tuna flavored spicy rice and the total came to $225 dollars. This wasn't a deal it was straight up robbery. I also learned why the service was so absolutely terrible... THEY ADD 18% AUTOMATICALLY TO ANY PARTY OF FOUR! \n\nIs that even legal? \n\nI have no clue, but I realized the service wasn't just grossly inadequate to keep us from ordering all you can eat items too often, it was so bad because THEY DIDN'T FUCKING CARE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE ADDING 18% AUTOMATICALLY so they had no incentive to provide any level of acceptable service.\n\nUsed to love this place as a happy hour spot but I will never go back. It was always a 3.5 star food spot with okay food and decent prices and great srvice. Now it's food is barely a 2 and the service is a negative 1 star.", "author": "Nic T."}

There's a large variety of stuff you can get.\n\nOk so my advice: go in a huge group, maybe 4-6. Order everything on the menu, share it amongst the group. I feel kinda bad ordering a lot when it's just me and my boyfriend. I peel off the rice and eat the nigiri as sashimi to conserve stomach space. \n\nThe appetizers:\nThe edamame's really good. Nice and warm, nicely salted, good portion, 1 order is enough for 3 people. \nFried tofu's not as good. They should've used egg tofu instead of the gamey tofu. The sauce for the fried tofu could've been more savory too, it's very watered down. Nori and fish shavings would be a nice touch to it too. The horenzo's yummy! It doesn't have the tart feeling on your tongue after you eat normal spinach. The sauce is nice and not too sweet. \nThe wakame salad was amazing. Loads of sesame, nice tangy taste, just the right amount of sauce and chili. We had 4 orders of it. The funny thing was the order portion got bigger and bigger as we got them.\nMiso soup was amazing. Lots of tofu, lots of seaweed, and the sprinkled spring onion makes it perfect. \n\nSushi:\nNigiri's come in 2 pieces per order. Rolls come in 6 pieces per order. Salmon, tuna, ika, eel were yummy. Don't get the seared tuna, it's just tasted like a lower quality tuna, seared, and powered with pepper. The white tuna wasn't nice either, it was very fishy, gamey, and didn't taste fresh at all. The rolls are nice. Small portions but it's nice cuz you can order more. Philadephia was better than San Francisco, the cream cheese adds a nice tangy taste to it. \n\nOther stuff:\nUdon was nice. Good portion for 1-2 people. Broth is clear, noodles were chewy. The crunchy stuff (i forgot what it's called) is really nice in it.\nTeriyaki beef was yummy too. The sauce was tangy.\nThe tempuras weren't my favorite, but my bf liked it. They were missing the raddish stuff that goes in the sauce. The shrimps were teeny and it was over-coated with batter. I'm not accustomed to broccoli and carrot tempura, so that was a bit weird. \nThe curry tonkatsu was nice at first, but it was too much for a person. But it's nice and crispy, the curry wasn't bad either. \n\nTheir plating on the appetizers and other stuff is nice and decent. They do a good job plating it like delicacies. \n\nAlso note their bathroom signs (the boy sign and the girl sign) are a decapitated boy and a decapitated girl. I thought that was really funny. \n\nOverall it's a nice, clean restaurant. The ambiance is nice and relaxing, service was really good (didn't take long to bring our food out, waitresses were cute and on top of their stuff) and bathroom was really big (at least for the girls) and clean.\nI would come here over a normal sushi place like the sushi boat because it's soooooooo much cheaper this way.

Of course it was packed on a Saturday night - the servers were definitely stressed out from accommodating customers' requests. Since they were preoccupied with serving tables with 50+ piece sushi plates, it took us 10+ minutes to get seated (despite there being 2 tables readily available). We could have just seated ourselves, gotten our own menus, and saved everyone the trouble...\n\nThings I appreciated:\n-The AYCE sushi option had a good combination of appetizers, nigiri, and rolls on the menu (favorites: salmon, surf clam, spicy scallop roll). There's no limit to order size as well - get as much as you want for the first round (or any round). Eat lots of nigiri to make it worth your $.\n-Good place for groups of 8-10.\n-We ate for 2 hours, but I never felt rushed in the process. \n-I liked the giant fish-shaped light fixture on the ceiling. Yep.\n\nThings I didn't appreciate as much:\n-The sushi was mediocre (in terms of freshness / flavor) - but at least it was plentiful!\n-Rolls were much smaller/plainer than I expected. Pretty sure the non-AYCE rolls were much bigger.\n-Service during peak hours. It got a lot better once people started leaving by 10-10:30pm (since there was no one else to serve but us, muahaha!).\n-Parking was a complete nightmare.

We went all out with the $25/person +$18 per child all you can eat dinner.  I was very happy to find the waitress showed no attitude when we ordered multiple dishes and sushi rolls. She didn't force us to order a set amount at a time before being allowed to order the next round.  We added dishes randomly every time she passed by and she had no problem with that and the service never slowed (another tactic ...as you get full waiting for the food).  We got so much food it was ridiculous and there is a full selection of appetizers, main dishes, sushi rolls and sushi (no sashimi on the all you can eat menu). \n\nThe fish had a beautiful color and was fresh, but the fish was sliced small with a good sized ball of rice you're expected to eat. I loved the Potato Croquettes. The Spider Rolls, Alaska Rolls, California rolls and Tempura rolls were very good too.  You don't get a lot of variety in the rolls - no creative conncoctions, but still good enough.  I didn't like the Tempura. I wanted more shrimp, less veggies.  We also got a big bowl of Edemame Beans, 3 salads, 3 Miso soups, and Pork Katsu, but the waitress forgot the grilled Saba/Mackeral dish.  Since we ordered two or three of many dishes and rolls, it was probably good that she did forget it.  Dessert is extra but you'll be too full te order it.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

I ordered my standard Hamachi sashimi  plate with 2 orders of Salmon nigiri. Sushi Hunter failed on both orders. The Hamachi sashimi was back, not belly. It was tough and watery, indicating it had been improperly stored or re-frozen. I told the waitress this grade of hamachi should be relegated to rolls or maybe poke style dishes only. The salmon nigiri was very skimpy and had no fat lines, so therefor was a very low grade. I told the waitress that a nigiri fish should always reflect in size relative to the person it is being served to, and this portion was more appropriate for a small girl.\n\nThe true rating would be 1/2 star.

Sushi Hunter would be in the bottom quartile of San Francisco sushi restaurants, more akin to something you would see in Kansas City (both the vibe and the food).  The all-you-can-eat menu is full of the typical cheapies, all done with a maximum of rice and a minimum of fish.  And the fish you do get tastes a bit like the boxed arrangements at Whole Foods--not terrible, but not particularly flavorful.  Once you have ordered, expect to wait a while to get your food, even if the chefs do not appear to be particularly busy.  The wait staff at times is not particularly attentive, sometimes requiring a lot of hand-waving to pay attention to you.

The AYCE menu is, not surprisingly, somewhat limited-  more so than their regular menu.   For example,  there's no salmon roe nigiri,  but there's enough other classics, and if the pieces seem  small, you can always place another order.    There's a larger list of rolls, but by swapping out avocado for cucumber or tuna for salmon you can see how combinatorics leads to a huge list with very few base ingredients.   They also provide a wide selection of other items (tempuras, salads, gyoza, etc), so you shouldn't run out of things to try.\n\nThe fish seems reasonably fresh, and they always make an effort to do a nice presentation (which can probably be daunting, given all the strange orders people make).  The downsides are that service can be slow- especially on a weekend night, and the ratio of rice:other ingredients is higher than ideal.    I'd recommend going on a weekday night and sitting at a larger table so you can order more than a plate of food at a time.   Just remember that you have to eat it all.", "author": "Susan C."}

Couple of limitations that were annoying but bearable:\n\n1) All or nothing for your table when it comes to AYCE\n2) All you can eat menu is much more limited in sushi choices than the regular menu (doesn't include the more pricey fish and rolls), and somewhat costly for the selection ($28 on a Friday)\n3) All you can drink ($12) only includes hot sake, so though they encourage you to drink sake bombs, the beers add up fast.\n\nOverall, the variety in food was fair though since it wasn't just sushi and we also ordered appetizers to start. I actually preferred the appetizers like assorted tempura, gyoza, mackerel, and beef teriyaki that we ordered to the actual fish as it wasn't terribly fresh. Out of the rolls on the AYCE menu, the roll with hotate was the only notable one. Ordered and tried all the nigiri, and maguro, ika, sake, and hokkigai we're the only ones that I re-ordered as the rest tasted too fishy to be very fresh.\n\nStaff was friendly and attentive enough given how busy they were (there were multiple large groups). Took a few tries to get more water, and they missed a few items we ordered on a few of the rounds, so we had to ask for them again, but since it was AYCE, no harm done.\n\nUltimately you get what you pay for, fair and great for groups, but definitely not fit for a foodie.", "author": "Tina H."}

Their $23.95 all you can eat menu is a serious value if you go in there hungry - although in true all you can eat fashion, it evens out in the end. (My friend and I certainly wolfed down more than $24 worth of sushi. The girls, on the other hand, nowhere near it. So... balance!) Their nigiri was acceptable - not mind blowingly good, but I've CERTAINLY had worse (I've actually had FAR worse, which led to one of those affore mentioned sessions in the bathroom). Their tempura was actually quite good. Their gyoza was, in my admittedly limited opinion, excellent. Rolls are standard fare - none of the fancier varieties, but relatively solid California rolls, rock n rolls, spicy tunas and the like (check out the devil roll, my personal fave!)\n\nThe service, I have to say, can be a tad spotty - but when the chefs are whipping out unlimited goodies for tubbs like me, with two waitresses running hither and tither, I couldn't hold it against them.\n\nLike I said.

Trust me, it's happened to me on one special occasion here at Sushi Hunter and my bf has never let me forget it. \n\nWith that said, the AYCD sake makes SH a fun place for groups.  I've been to SH three times now, all with large groups of 10+, and I've had a good time at each occasion.  Reservations are easy to make and they're great at accomodating large parties in the small space.  The AYCD sake is an additional $10 on top of the $25 AYCE sushi.  If you're not a fan of hot sake, you might be better off buying bottles. Personally, I prefer chilled, unfiltered sake, but I can't pass up the value of the AYCD sake so I let the hot sake chill to room temperature and chase it with some cold Sapporo. \n\nThe quality of the AYCE sushi has gone down over the years... Or maybe I was alot more sober on subsequent visits.  I used to think that the AYCE sushi was really delicious, but something about the temperature/flavor of the AYCE sushi was a bit off.  The temperature seemed a tad warmer than room temperature, which didn't do wonders for the flavor/texture of the sushi.  I took a few bites of sushi and stopped eating. Luckily, the AYCE list involves many cooked items. My gf and I shared tonkatsu, assorted tempura, gyoza, beef teriyaki, and chicken karaage. Those cooked items went a long way towards prepping my tummy for AYCD sake.  \n\nThe interior recently underwent a major renovation. Gone are the yellow walls and garrish lights. They now have white padded panels lining the walls and dark, blue mood lighting.  It's amazing what lighting can do to make a restaurant seem 10x classier. \n\nOverall: Sushi Hunter is a fun place for groups, but don't go expecting the best sushi.

She said, \"its either you all do or dont because there's no sharing\". The AYCE is $28 a person, for just the basic stuff then they charge you $4 extra each specialty item on the menu. That's misleading I think, considering they advertise AYCE for $28 and then you get there and all these exclusions and what not are all over the menu.. The food took forever to get to the table and the waitress I think made sure she didnt ask if we wanted any more.. \n\nIf i ever go back to SF, I wont be going back to this place.. its just not worth spending 3hours and still be hungry because they dont want to feed you..", "author": "Cathy L."}

We arrived at Sushi Hunter and were very pleased to only wait about 5 minutes for a 6-person table.\n\nImmediately, we inquired about the all-you-can-drink-sake.

You can get away with having 1 or 2 people NOT get AYCE, but otherwise, as people mentioned, $24/$26 M-Th/F-Su.

If you forgot, eat it anyway, you know it's going to be good!\n\nThe only down side, and i think i get their strategy, they are slow to come take your next order of refill sushi.

I'm the kinda sushi fan that believes fish should \"drape\" over the sides of the rice for a decent nigiri. Apparently SH doesn't share that same belief. Their motto? More rice!\n\nI think over 1/2 of what I ate was rice, which is very disappointing. The Hotate nigiri was also disappointing...I'm guessing they use bay scallops instead of the bigger sea scallops, which is why the scallop pieces were chopped up rather than placed over the rice without seaweed.\n\nOur waitress didn't know simple questions when we asked her (such as what fish they serve that are sustainable, or whether the salmon is fresh or farmed, etc.).\n\nWhat I can say is that the decor is alright, very \"aquatic\" themed.

They all taste good, so it's not a huge problem, but towards the end of the experience, when you're getting so full that you can't possibly eat anymore, you maybe just want one or two pieces of sushi, rather than six.  \n\nMy problem is I'm all about getting my money's worth (and believe me, we did), so I of course ate to the point of pain...because I could.  Be careful.  It's tempting, but it's already such a deal for the price that even after 2 or 3 rolls you're breaking even.  I managed something like 42 pieces of sushi and some seaweed salad.  Next time I'm going for 50, but boy I didn't realize how full I could get.  \n\nMy biggest problem at sushi restaurants is being able to consume more sushi than everyone else, and thus going home hungry so as to not break the bank.

Given this time it was a Saturday, the all you can eat is more $ than weekdays (makes sense and we knew that beforehand), and the place was pretty packed.  They put us at a little 2 person stand alone in between a bunch of other tables en route to the bathroom table, where my boyfriend bitched about staring at/facing the wall.\n\nDefinitely cramped and whenever anyone walked to the bathroom my boyfriend had to scoot his seat in so they could get by...\n\nAside from that issue, our waters were nearly empty at all points in time, the initial waters they gave us were warm (ice had long melted), and only about half full.  When we'd ask for more water, they literally would ignore us and walk around and refill everyone else in the entire place's water and still not refill ours (nor were other patrons waters actually empty as ours were).  \n\nAdditionally, after our initial sushi order, our waitress essentially never came over to us again.\nDuring our first round of rolls my boyfriend discovered a sticker stuck inside a roll, from the skin of an avocado.  Worrisome that 1) they put avocado skins in the sushi rolls, and 2) that the stickers would also be inside the roll.  We pointed this out to one of the waitresses (as ours had never returned), but she sort of laughed like it was no biggie...hm ok.\nSo as many people said, the time between orders is pretty ridic, and when you have no water and are being crammed in between huge parties/tables nearby who constantly need to go to the bathroom and trample you, the experience is that much less enjoyable.\n\nMost of the rolls (as our water in the rare occasions we had water), were somewhat warm, and yes, mostly rice and little fish.  I do like the crunch roll and the devil roll at first, but then after a couple orders i'd rather jump out a window than finish anymore of either of those rolls.\n\nWe had to wait for eternity to be able to tackle someone for a 2nd refill of water (which also hindered our ability to down as much sushi as we could otherwise), and to get our bill.\n\nThis time we will NOT be back. I mean it this time. And if we do return, I am 100% certain I will again regret it.\n\nAwful service, worrisome food. That said, the one male waiter (maybe a manager) was very nice and definitely overworked. They need a larger staff, at least for the busy weekend shifts....and given the stickers inside the sushi rolls, perhaps a new kitchen/quality control staff as well.", "author": "Danielle J."}

It is not about the food quality nor the service but the general policy of the place. \n\nSo, I was in a group of 8 people, all 7 of them ordered All you can eat menu, however I decided to take only mozzarella sticks. The waitress, when she heard that I will only do mozzarella sticks ask me to sit on the end of the table so I can not try/share food with the others as they do not allow 'sharing' the all you can eat menu, even if I am a girl and 6 other people were men! ok, logical but come on, 7 to 1, even if I had eaten it would have been the same. But fine. Then, in the middle of the dinner, as I was already done with my mozzarella sticks, and obviously finished especially as I placed my tissue and chopstick paper on the plate, she came and asked me if I am done so she can take away my plate, which was really rude after she pointed out how I am not \"allowed'' to try sushi from the others. \n\nThen, and this is really too much - never in my whole life I had experienced such a bad service and such a bad business!!!  \n\nMy friend, the second girl at the table, didn't like that sushi had a lot of rice in it, she left some 'rice balls' in her plate after we finished the dinner. The waitress came, cleaned the table and after including 20% gratuity, charged my friend an extra 3$ for not eating all the rice but ordering more sushi and actually eating more fish but not enough rice which would it make her more full in shorter time!!!!!  \n\nI will repeat again, never ever I had experienced such a bad service, frustrated waitress or management or I don't know what, but it was humiliating. They were treating us as we came there to eat as pigs for some cheap money! \n\nAnd we ended up paying 280$ for a dinner for 8 people which we could spend in a normal restaurant but not in this place with not that bad sushi but with worst customers service ever!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-25", "description": "Back in college, our days seemed to be filled with sushi buffets. Maybe because we were poor college students with an endless appetite but also because my bf went to Davis, the land of all you can eat sushi joints. They might not have been the best sushi around but we still have fond memories of dining at those places. When we found an all you can eat option at Sushi Hunter with a free 1.5 hours of parking, we were so there!\n \nI guess the first sign I should have taken to heart was the limited amount of specialty rolls offered. Their list seems to be pretty long with appetizers, hot dishes, nigiris and rolls but everything offered was average or below.\n\nWe had the edamame and miso soup for appetizers. How edamame can taste so bland I don't know but they did here. We were stuck with a huge bowl of it too that we had to finish or would be charged for wasted food. We had the tempura and saba for our hot dishes and those were just okay. I didn't really like the tempura green peppers. I'm not really used to those in my tempura mix. The saba was very oily but not bad. \n\nThey try to make their list look diverse but all of the rolls were basic.  The most \"special\" were the rock n' roll and spicy hotate (scallop) roll. They also had a Kentucky roll which was chicken and lettuce. I think it's obvious that one didn't taste good. Actually most of them didn't taste good.\n\nOne of my biggest peeves was how slow the service was. It almost seemed like they wanted us to go over our validated 1.5 hours of parking so we'd have to pay the garage for going over. If that was their intention, they successed. We had to pay an extra $6 because of how slow they were. And trust me, we can polish off any sized plate of sushi in under ten minutes. \n\nI'd much rather go somewhere else to order rolls I like than eat a whole lot of average to below average tasting rolls I wouldn't normally order. I highly recommend you look at the menu first before going and really think if you would enjoy what's being offered. Maybe the regular menu is better but I think Davis sushi buffets have this place beat and for cheaper prices too.", "author": "Julia T."}

My family has been frequenting this local sushi restaurant for the past 2 years on a fairly regular basis hoping in vain that  the quality of service and food will improve. We succumbed to the convenience of their location. Last night, however, they reached their all time low and we have decided not to return again.\n\nNot only is my 7 year old home today with a stomach ache from poor quality sushi (on her birthday no less!), two of our orders were botched, I had to ask twice for a refill of hot versus tepid tea and I had to return two orders of sashimi that looked questionable. On top of all that, the waitress had the nerve to tell me that the fish always looks like that. Really? Shriveled and dry looking? I eat plenty of sushi to know the difference. By the time the food came out, my daughter was falling asleep at the table.\n\nWhile I am willing to overlook mediocre service for high quality sushi (my favorite food), I cannot compromise on the latter. The biggest shame was that we were regular customers, i.e. a source of regular business to the point where we know nearly all of the wait staff and sushi chefs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-18", "description": "Another place that I have been looking at for years and had been wanting to try for the longest time.\n\nTreated my dad and my GF here for dinner tonight and have to say this is one of the harder reviews I've had to write since I have such mixed feelings about our experience.  We each had the $23.99 all you can eat menu (weekday) special where you can order anything and as much as you like off their special menu (nice variety) with the one condition that you don't waste or you may get charged.\n\nI never should have told my dad that because instead of setting forth on a culinary adventure of discovery and excitedly looking forward to what we were going to order next, he instead sat there worrying and asking who was going to finish the fried zucchini so that we don't get charged.  From there, things only went downhill when our sushi arrived.  The pieces were small which I had no problem with since they were easy to eat in one bite (I figured you can order as much as you want anyway so size wasn't that big a factor).  The fish itself, although not mind blowing, seemed pretty fresh although far from buttery or magical.  Where the sushi really fell flat on it's face, however, was in the rice.  As we ate, he endlessly and relentlessly would not stop b#tching about how bad the sushi was.  He told us that the rice was cooked too hard, the nori tough, and that there was no rice vinegar or mirin in it like proper sushi rice should.  \n\nHe went so far as to say that the supermarket sushi at Nijiya or Tokyo Fish was much better.  Not quite what you want to hear when you consider that the only reason you took him there was in an attempt to make him happy and do something nice for him, especially when you know that this cheap sushi dinner is still coming out to over $100.  It got on my nerves so much after a while that I actually told our waitperson this (who actually turned out to also be the manager) when she asked.  Yes, I was so fed up with hearing him complain that I told her his comments on the sushi.  I immediately felt bad, but what can you do?  She was very professional about it and said that sushi is so subjective (I agreed) and told me that it's good to hear input from customers.  It was a good answer and exactly what I would have said if I had been in her shoes.  \n\nThis now being far from a magical dining experience, my GF and I proceeded to polish off three large hot sakes (they weren't that large) at $7 each.  I agreed with him on the sushi, but still didn't want to hear it over and over during the meal which only made things worse.  I then proceeded to order three more non-sushi items to go with the earlier appetizers of vegetable and prawn tempura, gyoza, and korokke (potato croquette) that we ordered earlier.  \n\nThe chicken kara-age fried chicken was good and the grilled mackerel small, but tasty.  The curry pork tonkatsu cutlet was nicely cooked and actually really good, but the super watery curry dip (WTH?) left me wanting.  There seemed to be no consistency in portion size either...it varied widely depending on the item ordered and...I'm guessing, what it probably cost them.  The chicken kara-age portion was generous, as was the curry pork cutlet, but the above grilled mackerel and the potato croquette were tiny.  When I say croquette, I really mean one croquette as in one small, thin potato croquette (like a McD hash brown, but way smaller) cut in half longitudally with two squiggles of mayo (I hate mayo!)  \n\nAs we ate this, my dad saw someone in the next table order ikura (salmon roe) sushi and actually wanted to try it so I went ahead and place one order for him (two pieces).  When the sushi came out, he was really happy and said that they had made it differently this time and that the rice was much better.  He really liked it and so I went ahead and asked for three more orders (six pieces) of ikura sushi for him which he actually enjoyed.  I was impressed that they actually listened and accomodated him.\n\nAfterwards, we all enjoyed green tea ice cream (3 x $1.50) which tasted okay.  He said it was nothing like the fro-yo we had the night before at Moyo's and joked that the portion was so tiny compared with what the birthday girl at another table received.  Their menu was clear  that this was not included and although $1.50 is nothing, I really thought it should have been included with the meal.  \n\nWith a good tip, the three all you can eat menus, three large hot sakes, one Diet Coke (for him), and three green tea ice creams came out to over $137.  Granted, $21 of that was sake, but even then, it didn't seem so cheap in the end.  Then again, we did have as much sushi as we wanted and also a wide variety of Japanese appetizer dishes.  The other girls working there were really sweet, too. \n\nNot sure what to make of this place...on one hand, it seems like a deal, yet on the other hand, it really wasn't.  Like I said earlier, mixed feelings about the experience.  Don't think I'll be back anytime soon.", "author": "Roy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-29", "description": "Traveling to Tokyo two years ago, I ate the best sushi of my life at the Tsukiji fish market so I consider the \"all- you- can eat sushi buffet\" an oxymoron in the Japanese culinary culture. However, I was pleasantly surprised after my visit to a recent buffet created by owners Hanson and Christy Lau, who presented some unique offerings that made my meal worthwhile. As the stand-alone Japanese restaurant in the rustic Italian district of North Beach, Sushi Hunter quietly sits in the corner of the Powell street hill, surprising patrons daily with a rowdy ambiance.\nOcean blue walls and giant marlins serve as the centerpiece, creating a sea harbor d\u00e9cor. The sushi bar is illuminated with neon sapphire lights to create a sensual mood. Big screen TVs broadcast sporting events while jovial patrons participate in sake festivities. The waiting staff is attentive to refill drinks and to take the customers' next round of order.\n\nThe all-you-can-eat sushi bar offers fifty made-to-order items. The menu includes appetizers, cooked entrees, nigiri sushi, and sushi rolls. Sprinkled with sesame, the spinach appetizer is a great starter. Not overwhelmed by any sauces, the natural taste of spinach shines through the dish. With a gelatinous texture, the seaweed salad offers a cool crunch. The miso soup is slightly diluted so an added teaspoon of miso paste would have rounded out the kelp and bonito flakes. Without price as an issue, I ordered a selection of nigiri sushi (served in pairs). Arriving on a black lacquer plate, the sushi displays a myriad of colors, creating an appetizing canvas. Smothered with a slather of teriyaki sauce, the buttery eel could have used a dash of sugar in the sauce. The salt cured mackerel combines a strong savory taste with a rich finish. For a sweet sea crunch, the squid nigiri will do the trick. With a creative spin, the seared tuna flaunts a slightly smoky crust with a sweetly mild interior. Melt-in-your-mouth, buttery yellowtail sets an example of sweet, fresh fish. The Japanese often finish a nigiri meal with tamago (the sweet omelette). Created by layering thin, fried eggs, the combination of pungent eggs, mirin, and sugar ends a great nigiri set. Unlike other all -you-can-eat sushi places, Sushi Hunter serves a reasonable portion of fish to rice ratio.\n\nFor the next round, I sampled a few sushi rolls that did not disappoint. Putting a new twist on a classic, the fried California roll contrasts a crunchy tempura crust with a buttery sweetness from the rice and the imitation crab meat. With a shimmering seaweed cast, the shrimp tempura roll delights the palate as it combines chewy seaweed and crispy shrimp. Pan-fried with a chewy skin and crispy brown bottom, the gyoza (Japanese potsticker), was the best appetizer of the night. Cooked al dente, the udon satisfied my comfort food appetite; however, the soup base needed a dash of salt. Fried till golden brown, the chicken karaage is a great Japanese version of the chicken nugget; a quick dunk in soy sauce adds even more flavor. Contrasting the texture from the mackerel sushi, the grilled mackerel features a nutty, savory skin that balances out the flaky, mild meat. Coated with a light batter, the shrimp and vegetable tempura is meant to be dunked ever-so-slightly to sustain crunchiness and prevent a soggy coating. A floral green tea ($1.50 each) refreshes the palate and ends a great feast. For the entire meal, with tax and tip, I spent sixty dollars for two people.\n\nBehind the tandem team of Hanson and Kristy Lau, Sushi Hunter has gone through challenging times. Their previous partner was caught in a money laundering scandal. Despite debts, litigation battles, and the troubled economy from 9-11, the restaurant survived on pure determination. Immigrating from Hong Kong to pursue the American dream, the owners were determined to carry Sushi Hunter through the hurdles. Desiring to differentiate themselves from most Japanese restaurants, the owners chose the Italian eatery row (North Beach) and an all-you-can-eat menu. Sushi Hunter is a great neighborhood restaurant if you're in the mood for an elaborate tasting menu.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

Thought this was the chance to try Sushi Hunter which I found through Open Table and Yelp.\n\nVenue:  Small Mom and Pop in the heart of North Beach.\n               Better described as \"All You Can Order and Eat Sushi\" for $25.95\n\nAmbiance/Decor:  Minimal and Casual.\n\nSocial Scene:  \n-  2 young teenagers on a date\n-  An Asian family who got hooked up with good stuff, I mean we watched tray after tray of beautiful sushi arrived at their table(Seems like they knew the owner)\n-  We missed the two large parties (about 20 each) the staff were setting tables for.\n\nService:  5 stars for the service.

If you expect great sushi rolls, the rolls were skinny and not like what I get from Nijiya market in J-Town.\n4.

If we were in North Beach and wanted sushi, we will go to this place but we will not purposely go back given the lack of parking in the area and abundance of very good sushi in the City.  \n\nMore About Our Date Night:\nThe night was beautiful, not too cold.

They're CONSTANTLY refilling your tea and water without asking and always making sure EVERYTHING is going well!\n\nPRICE: Like every other sushi restaurant, but when you taste the quality of their sushi, you'll come to appreciate their normal pricing, because the flavor in each roll is UNMATCHABLE, which warrants higher pricing!\n\nMENU: 28 basic rolls along with 26 specialty rolls!\n\nROLLS:\n\nSake Maki (salmon): Although this may seem like any other basic roll, do not be fooled by it's simplicity, because this is THE BEST basic roll I have ever tasted.  I, like most people, believe sushi is BEST-SERVED cold, but Sushi Hunter breaks away from this tradition by doing something to this roll.  I cannot describe it and figure out what Sushi Hunter did, but whatever they did, IT WORKS! It's almost as if Sushi Hunter lightly warms the roll before serving it, because once you put it into your mouth, it pretty much MELTS in your mouth.  The roll is BUTTERY SMOOTH that literally MELTS in your mouth.  TRY IT! (5 stars)\n\nTekka Maki (tuna): Another basic roll that is best eaten and finished right when it is served.  Like I said for the Sake Maki, it just MELTS in your mouth.  Another MUST TRY! (5 stars)\n\nLion King Roll (Imitation crab meat inside topped with salmon and special sauce, oven toasted)  It's OVEN-TOASTED! Enough said! Anything oven-toasted comes out mouth-watering!  (4 stars)\n\nRocky Roll (tempura flour crunch and imitation crab meat inside topped with BBQ eel and avocado):  2 UNIQUE things here.  1. No tempura needed in this one; they simply use the crunchy parts of tempura.  2. No use of teriyaki eel, instead they barbeque it! So with those differences, Sushi Hunter serves THE BEST DRAGON ROLL! (2nd: Sunny Sushi  3rd: American Sushi House)  Along with the two aforementioned characteristics that makes this the BEST DRAGON ROLL, Sushi Hunter does not drown the roll in sauce causing the crunchy bits to become soggy.

I have spent a large sum of money trying to find the ONE PLACE I can call my FAVORITE Japanese restaurant.  So after my search in the cities of San Mateo, Millbrae, San Bruno, Daly City, South San Francisco, and San Francisco, after I have used gallons of gas driving, and after I have spent hundreds of dollars trying out different rolls, I can say with CONFIDENCE that SUSHI HUNTER is THE BEST and therefore MY FAVORITE Japanese Restaurant!  Hopefully with this said, it will warrant your curiosity to try out Sushi Hunter!", "author": "Matthew L."}

What more can you want. And I'm not just talking sushi, I'm talking edame, sashimi, other apps, a variety of rolls, all made to order! I've had some bad experiences with all you can eat sushi places that make your tummy very very sad. This is not one of them. The only thing is that they want you to finish everything you order so make sure you can finish everything you get. The wait is a bit long, especially on the weekends, but this place is the bomb. My hubby can eat a lot of sushi so it can get a bit pricey at other restaurants, so this little gem is fab for us. LOVE LOVE LOVE Sushi Hunter.", "author": "Hanan H."}

As the local, I felt obligated to eat most of the order.  In all, my most recent meal was still very enjoyable, but can't give top rating anymore.

But I gave the food 2 stars, sake 4 stars, and I guess 3 was just right.\n\nCame here on Saturday night to grab dinner and drinks before heading to Cobb's.   We got there around 6:30pm, which isn't dinner rush, and there were plenty of seats, but still there were some large groups already there. \n\nThe BF and I, never had all you can eat sushi, but what really sold us  was the all you can drink Sake. \n\nOrdered some appetizers, some teriyaki and rolls.  Came in like 15 minutes. Not shabby on timing. The appetizers which was really the miso soup, and seaweed salad was good (but you REALLY CANT mess up basic miso, and cold seaweed salad).\n\nThe rolls were meh, skimpy on the ingredients, heavy on the rice, BUT its all you can eat... so I understand. The rolls tasted all kinda the same, since rice dominated it.  Tempura was good, not soggy or to heavy on the batter. Chicken teriyaki... umm my bf ate it up, but it was meh to me.\n\nThe sake KEPT on flowing! They were not shady in refilling our sake! I mean we must have went through (and im not kidding), 10 of them!  And we started to drink a little with our wonderful server, and he ended up getting shots of the GOOD sake from the back for us.\n\nSecond time, we ordered more food to soak up some of the sake we had consumed. And this was the breaker =(  It took 30 minutes to 45 minutes!  I mean, we order some very basic stuff, like edamame!\n\nGiven the restaurant got a LITTLE bit more fuller, still 30- 45 minutes?? At that time we had to leave to head to Cobb's, got the check... THEN our food finally arrived!  By that time, with the delay of food intake, we felt full.\n\nI guess thats how they make money.  Overall, what did it was that we consumed soo much sake that it was ended up being worth it. \n\nI would say great for drinkers, and for ppl that dont have big of a taste for GOOD sushi.

Eating in is great; solid food, good service, excellent prices. Delivery, on the other hand, is a nightmare. \n\nThe first time I ordered, it took TWO HOURS for my food to arrive. After an hour, I began calling the restaurant. The woman who picked up said the delivery person got lost (my place is a few blocks away from the restaurant) and that they'd be there soon. Thirty minutes passed and I called back. She said she'd check where the delivery person and get back to me, though I never heard from her again and the restaurant stopped answering its phone after that. This week, I decided to give delivery another chance, figuring the first time was just a fluke. When I place my order I was told delivery would take 45-55 minutes. An hour and fifteen minutes later I called the restaurant. The woman who answered said the delivery person was on her way. Another fifteen minutes passed - nothing. I called back yet again and the woman said she'd call and find out where the delivery person was and get back to me. Again, I never heard back from her. I tried calling back to cancel my order in favor of ordering a pizza, but the line was busy for the next 15 minutes straight.

I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't what I got at Sushi Hunter - and I mean that with the best possible intent.\n\nI've been to a few All-You-Can-Eat sushi places, and they have always been done one of two ways: Either you select from the boats going around the bar, which are usually filled with mainly things you don't want. OR it's buffet style, and you have no idea how long anything has been out, and the rice being a little firm isn't helping your thoughts on it.\n\nSushi Hunter does AYCE in an entirely new and much more awesome way. You get a menu with a selection of items that include nigiri, maki, appetizers, teriyaki - pretty much all the mainstays of any sushi restaurant, and get this... You order as you go. Want a miso soup, some gyoza, oshitashi, tempura and a hamachi nigiri the first round - great! Second round, maybe some more gyoza, some salad, a couple rolls - no problem! Third round (if you can make it that far)... and on and on. They bring it out to you just as though you were ordering from a normal menu and paying for it ala carte, so it's always as fresh as whenever you first order it, so why not order a little at a time?\n\nTheir service is fantastic - our server was very attentive, and smiled the entire time we were there. The food was decent - again with the \"typical mid-range of a casual Japanese place.\" I'd definitely go back if I felt like stuffing myself on sushi at a fixed cost.\n\nFor the record, for two of us on the AYCE menu with a bottle of sake, and a 20% tip, we spent $85.

Then the menus came out for the all-you-can-eat... I thought it was going to be buffet style so this was great cuz they make the sushi fresh for you. The menu included appetizers like gyoza, wakame, salad, udon, miso soup; entrees like tonkatsu, curry katsu, fried makarel; rolls (about 10 or so); and nigiri sushi of all sorts. And even better: there was enough variety that even I (8 months pregnant) had a good choice of sushi (the sashimi looked sooooo fresh and, according to everyone, tasted good too! Sigh, after the baby comes we'll go again!)\n\nThe service was good in the beginning, but, because our party was so big, they started mixing up our orders and gave us seconds of previous items.

Of course, the menu is limited so I can't speak to the dishes not on the AYCE menu, but basically I would never pay for anything I did eat were it not part of a gorge-yourself menu.  We had all the staples: tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, scallop, shrimp, some hot dishes, etc... For better quality, hit up Ace in the Marina (I know, I know, sorry...) or Miyabe... Blowfish too.  So quality-wise, I got what I paid for.  \n\nBut the service... THEY owe ME for that.  Everyone knows how AYCE works - I come in quietly.  I browse the menu as if contemplating ordering something legit, but you and I both know what I'm here for.  I probably reek of booze, but I'm maintaining.  \"I think we'll have the all-you-can-eat menu, please.\"  You nod, collect the menus, maybe judge silently, but the contract has been signed.  You walk away, and come back with our first - of what you know to be many - rounds of fish.  You might snicker here and there about the over-fried roll we're leaving barely-touched in the middle of the table, but you keep bringing us more of the other things we order.  When we're about to re-gift everything you've just fed us, you ask politely the question the answer to which we should have given several rounds ago - \"yes, we are done.\"  We pay, you don't call in the morning, and we walk by from then on like it never happened.\n\nBUT NO SUSHI HUNTER, THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR YOU ISN'T IT!?!?!?!  \n\nI don't know if this is the kind of restaurant that likes to be smacked around a little, and smacks a little back, but I don't like fighting to get food.  I CAME HERE to get fat.  I CAME HERE because I want a stream of food so endless that when my stomach runs out of space it starts diverting spicy tuna to my heart.  The default should be \"Bring these guys more food.\"  Don't they know how hard it is to get up and flag waitresses down when you're engaged in this kind of feat?  Vicious.

Yes, sushi in North Beach.. better yet, all-you-can-eat sushi in North Beach :) \n\nWe were kinda in a rush since we only had about an hour before our show. So we sat down, glanced at the menu, waved down the waitress (before a group of 6 could), and started ranting off what we wanted. \n\nThe food came out pretty quick; there were two sushi chefs working and two waitresses. Within 5 minutes our appetizers (edamame,  2 wakames, fried tofu, cold tofu, and 4 miso soups) started slowly appearing.. and disappearing at the same time. While we were still working on those, our sushi rolls ( 2 orders of spicy tuna, 2 orders of rock n roll, crunch roll, albacore maki, and a San Francisco roll)  along with our salmon, tuna, and hamachi sushi nigiri AND our chicken katsu were making its way to the table. \n\nBetween four people, we had a decent amount of food. We even had enough time.. and stomach space to get a couple more nigiri. Too bad the group of 6 decided to take all the hamachi for the rest of the night. Selfish. \n\nEven though we were about 20 minutes late to the show, it was worth it. The salmon and hamachi slices  were SO unbelievably fresh; it just melted in my mouth.

The cuts are thick, the usual evening chef is cool, and you can get any kind of roll or temaki you want to order.

Against all my better instincts and experiences eating salmon in San Francisco (it is generally universally bad -- I claim Salmon Snob rights also, because I used to live in Seattle), I got some really nice cuts of it here.

There is definitely enough in the buffet menu to keep you satisfied. I don't think I'll be dying to come back for the buffet, because I'm not so much a buffet person. The fish for the nigiri weren't so fresh, besides from the salmon. The unagi was very good. But most of all, the beef teriyaki was a steak rather than just beef.

The place was bright and clean.\n\nService: All but one of the waitresses were very sweet. The birthday boy and 2 others in his car were running late. 45 minutes after our reservation time, the not-very-nice waitress came over to berate us for his tardiness and point out what a big favor the restaurant is doing by letting us wait at our table for so long. When the latecomers showed up, the first thing she told them was how long the rest of us had been waiting.

After all, this restaurant is named SUSHI HUNTER.   The name alone makes it sound like it boasts the most thrilling dining experience San Francisco has to offer.  The first thing that went through my mind was \"Am I really going to get to HUNT for my own SUSHI?!\"  Was I expected to roll up to this place, packin' my CO2 pellet gun, continuously guzzle down carafe after caraffe of hot sake, and aim my barrel at little round targets on wooden sushi boats circling the dining room Kaiten-zushi style? \n \nEdamame? ***BAM!*** \n \nSpicy tuna roll?   ***BOOM!*** \n \nHamachi Nigiri?  ***BULLSEYE!*** \n \nPresent me the fruits of my labors, waitress!  Bring me the spoils of the hunt! \n \nUnfortunately this was NOT AT ALL the case.\n \nIn the back of my mind, I can only hope that shooting range sushi was the owner's original intention when naming his/her restaurant \"Sushi Hunter,\" a dream crushed only by liability reasons and patrons' unwillingness to sign waivers upon entry.  However, I was disappointed by much more than Sushi Hunter's unwillingness to let me fire my rubber pellets at will. \n \nFirst of all, we were here for a birthday party for the one-and-only Ashley M.  While I give props to the staff for putting up with our incessant sake bombing, boisterous curse-laden toasts and repeated spilling of booze all over the table, the kitchen seemed to be completely overwhelmed by our party of ~20 ordering the famous all-you-can-eat menu.  They couldn't bring out the gyoza, maki, nigiri, or even edamame and sake fast enough to fill our tummies.  And we weren't gorging ourselves or having some sort of eating competition; we were just eating at a normal pace.  There was absolutely, positively no way to get our money's worth of the promised \"all-you-can-eat sushi\" and \"all-you-can-drink sake.\"  No way.  For $24.95 for sushi, $13 for mediocre hot sake and $6/beer, we would have had to have consumed a shit-ton more than we did to make it worth the lump sum we paid at the end of the night.  \n\nIn my mind, the greatest affront Sushi Hunter committed was that after we paid the bill because part of our party was leaving, the waitresses refused to bring us one final bottle of sake to finish off the meal.  Just because a few people left the table and we paid our bill with obligatory 17% tip, service just stops dead?  Good thing my CO2 chamber was emptied by the time that happened...\n\nAdmittedly, I did have a great time for Ashley's birthday party but it was because of the company, not the service or food.  If I ever go back to Sushi Hunter, I'm going in with a vengeance.  I'm wearing camo, I'm not eating for two days beforehand, and I'm chowing down on maki Sonya \"Black Widow\" Thomas-style!

When my friend told us that we were celebrating her 26th birthday at the Sushi Hunter, I thought, \"Great, that will be so fun\"! Little did I know that , \"so fun\" was actually going to mean, \"drink yourself into oblivion\" and try to make it home. \n\nThere were 15 people in our party, so we all did the All-You-Can-Eat sushi. The menu is 50 items long and ranges from appies, to nigiri to rolls. You can order anything you want in mass quantities, but beware. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of the menu, better known as the 3rd asterick. I can't quote it verbatim, but the effect is \"you will be charged for frivolously wasting nigiri rice balls\". I'm sorry, what? It was my first experience at the Sushi Hunter, but the more seasoned vets in my party explained to me that I was only to eat the fish and to ball my rice balls into a napkin, where we would then take turns ridding ourselves of them in the bathroom. I thought that was the most bizarre part of the evening, until the waiter asked me if I wanted the All-You-Can-Drink sake. Wait, huh? Come again? I surely thought that I was hearing things. Nope, for a mere $11 you can proceed to drink hot sake to your heart's content. Sign me up!\n\nThe rest of the evening gets blurry from here, but I will say this: If you are a fellow Gaucho, you have been to the Sushi Hunter before. Only it was called Kyoto's on Upper State or Something's Fishy on lower State Street.

The rolls and nigiri, like I said before, ok. I'm a picky sushi guy, and all the stuff on the all you can eat menu was frozen.  But the sauces on the rolls cover up the quality of the fish.

I suggested Mood Sushi (on Beach and Taylor), but apparently, the sushi chef does not come in  until 5p (it was 3:40pm).  We headed back to Columbus, North Beach Sushi, but they did not open until 4:30p (it was 3:55p).  We were hungry, very hungry, have not eaten anything all day and was ready to settle for whatever we can find, sushi or not, but decided that we've come this far and sushi was what we wanted... Thank goodness for Sushi Hunter (third time's a charm)!  \n     Why have I not eaten at SH before since I live in the neighborhood and love sushi?

Today, I have to say that I disagree with her because I really like this place...\n      Rob and I shared a Specialty Roll,  Hot Tuna Roll (tuna & avocado inside, topped with seared tuna) for only $10.50.  Rolls were decent size.  I specially like the seared tuna on top; lightly seared and very tasty!  We also each had a bento box.

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first.  I feared that that the food would be pre-made, sitting in a bin, and that the sushi would be egregiously over-stuffed with rice.  Thankfully, these fears were unfounded.  The all-you-can-eat option is a steal.  For $22.95, you get all the FRESH Japanese food you can eat.  Literally, you order the food (from the somewhat limited, but still reasonably vast, all-you-can-eat menu) and THEN they make it.  There are appetizer options (like miso soup, green salad, edamame, gyoza, agedashi tofu, etc.), entree options (like chicken teriyaki, assorted tempura, saba shioyaki, etc.), and sushi options (like maguro, seared maguro, hamachi, sake, etc. and assorted rolls).  The hot items (like tempura) arrive at the table piping hot.  The sushi looks just as it would if you ordered it a la carte.  At first blush, $22.95 may sound like a lot, but considering the quality of the food, it's actually a steal.\n\nThe one drawback is that the service can be a little spotty.  But if you're going for the all-you-can-eat option, you're probably not in a hurry anyway.

I also value authenticity over flash.  I really only like to sit at the sushi bar and ask the chef whats fresh, what he likes etc.  There are only 2 sources of wholesale sushi quality fish for all of the SF Japanese restaurants.  Meaning that as long as its fresh, its pretty consistent quality everywhere you go.  So one searches for other criteria-- namely the rice quality, the attitude of staff, price-value, the rapport w/ sushi chef etc.  Sushi Hunter is really only worthy if you want to play the tabehodai/all you can eat game- thats why they got 2 instead of 1 stars from me.

Four stars for this joint?\nFirst of all, this place is located near north beach and is one of the ONLY few non-italian food places you can go to. My biggest complaint of this establishment was if you are going to put \"all you can eat\" deal then provide all the \"FOOD PEOPLE WANT TO EAT\" I went there with a very large group awhile back and the owner looked irritated about the amount of food he thought \"We'd consume\" He told us that because it has been so busy that day, a lot of things had \"run\" out and the waitress kept coming back to say \"sorry no more\" We sat there and ate few pieces of nigiri and maki when all of the sudden the bill was handed to us without us even asking for it! Really? Then being the large group we were, we decided all to pay cash and while counting the cash to put into the bill, the waitress takes the money out of my hand and starts counting herself! How rude! While the food was ok, i have a better luck going down to my neighbor safeway for some sushi....... it was the service and the attitude of this place that had me saying \"Hontoni?\" \n\nBasic point,\ndont go here because its \"all you can eat sushi\"\ntheir sign should be \"all you can eat sushi or whatever we have left of\" \n\nPoor service, poor food, and rude waitress who just wants your money!", "author": "Youna K."}

Sushi is not our little italian food infested neighborhoods strong suit. You've got this place and sushi on north beach down street. I like Sushi Hunter better. \n\nThe sushi is ok, I haven't had anything bad, but I would never recommend this place based solely on it's wonderful, fresh fish or clever delicious rolls - no way. It's totally basic, some rolls just ok, fish seems good, but not outstanding quality really nothing to rave about on the menu that I've found so far. Sushi Hunter gets my business because of it's service, location, and lack of competition in the area. But, it's grown on me and I have a lot of fun memories here over the years. Back in the immediate post college days the Miguel and I would come here often with friends to sake bomb and dig into their all you can eat menu's, which is a good deal if you really eat a lot of sushi. For the guys it was a bargain, for me I'd rather just order a few orders of exactly what i want. Anyways, they are always friendly, they can accomodate large groups and they're totally accepting of loud obnoxious sake bombing, yelling and making a mess of beer all over the table (I prefer to just pour my sake in for the bomb rather than the whole scene on the chop stick, banging the table etc). Sushi hunter's friendly encouraging behavior of sake bombing single handedly was responsible for many of our worst hangovers back in 2005, I think they used to offer $10 all you can drink house sake (is that right? it seemed to good to be true back then too). Pretty sure Miguel has a scar on his forehead compliments of his lovely girlfriend under the crazy sake special influence. They've also got a flat screen that always has ESPN on so my guy would like coming here for that reason too. They play very random, but always pretty fun music. \n\nIt's really a great place to come for a bite to eat and some sake before starting a fun night. Because of this reason, we recently had a birthday party here and the same night across the room was another large party. They handled the groups well, let us bring in our own cake, and they spruced it up with some chocolate drizzle and put it on a cute platter and came out signing happy birthday. That scored big time points with me since a few other places I'd called wouldnt let us bring in our own cake, they really went the extra mile and I appreciated it. \nI am moving back to northbeach in a few months and will be living almost directly across the st from sushi hunter - so - I am anticipating being back many times in the near future.", "author": "Audrey V."}

The waitress sent her manager who showed us on the menu that it said that 18% gratuity was included for parties of 5 or more.

I would go back, but i wouldn't go out of my way to get out here.  i just happen to live down the street, so i will definitely be back when i'm in the all-you-can-eat sushi mood.  The rolls i thought were typical, and so was the nigiri.  There wasn't anything we ate that i thought \"jesus get me out of here\"\n\noverall, its $23 or so for all you can eat (Fri and Sat nights are more i believe).  reading from the other reviews, Fri or Sat are not the nights to go, as it's super crowded.  this was definitely not my case (Tues night), the service was friendly and fast.  considering other options in SF, this isn't a bad deal.  and believe me, we ate a lot - plates and plates and plates.", "author": "Jason J."}

Something about the food tasted funny and it took me awhile to track down the source. The sushi tasted almost chemical. My friends and I think we pinpointed the taste in the rice. It was certainly not fresh and had likely been kept in plastic tupperware for an extended period of time. The plastic was what lead to the severe \"chemical\" quality of the food. I would NEVER go back!", "author": "Ashley B."}

When we first got there, the service was really good although a roll didn't get sent to us, but no big deal. As the restaurant got a little busier, we noticed that the service became average (they would forget to bring us stuff and we would have to remind them). The food itself was pretty good. The gyoza was delicious. The Udon was the perfect size. It was nice that they had appetizers, entrees, and sushi for the all you can eat rather than just sushi. Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. Would definitely eat there again. :)", "author": "Shar L."}

All of the food was made fresh as you ordered.  We had a pretty large group, the hot food came at a pretty decent rate, but the sushi takes longer.  The variety was decent and everything on the whole was good.", "author": "Julie Y."}

The maguro was previously frozen, the sake was mushy and the saba was too oily.\n\nAll in all I give it two stars. Meh.", "author": "Charlie K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-27", "description": "Something about this place just didn't seem right to me.... I can't really put my finger on it.... Maybe it was the funky smell that was permeating from my menu while I was trying to decide on some rolls.... or the weird air freshener smell that was so strangely strong that it seemed as if they were trying to hide something....And just for the sake of sounding totally crazy... I felt as if everything in there had been tainted with fish (which I am not a fan of)... While the restaurant appeared very clean for some strange reason it didn't feel that way.... Maybe I'm crazy.... Well yes I am, but besides all of that it just was off.... The name Sushi Hunter doesn't help either... it just conjures up crazy mental images in my head for some reason..... On the plus side the staff was uber friendly, they have soy paper for their rolls which is a huge plus in my book, and they had really yummy iced tea.... Nothing was really wrong, but it just wasn't really right.... That makes sense.... Right?", "author": "Jennifer B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-08-13", "description": "Knowing that this place was in northbeach, i was hesitant to try it, but we were looking for a japanese restaurant where they served decent sushi and sake with a group of friends. First of all, we did not order the all you can eat menu, though we ended up dropping approximately 35 dollars each and was not satisfied with the amount of food ordered. \n\nThe rolls priced between 10 - 12 dollars each were considered small and unfilling in comparison to other restaurants where they serve up bigger rolls with more fish in each bite. We tried the oyaku don, which was mediocre. There were chunks of chicken in some egg mixture atop rice, but there is nothing to rave about in that dish. We ordered a couple bottles of sake and sapporo and had a good time, but the food was disappointing. It tasted okay for some of my friends since they were drunk at that point. but it really wasn't worth the money.\n\nThe reason for the 1 star rating is largely due to the fact that the service was terrible! They wouldn't seat us until our whole party was there even though we had made reservations. Knowing the parking difficulties in north beach, i would assume they could be a little more lenient and understanding when we told them our friends were parking. \nAlso, they sat our 5 person party at a 4 person table even though there was a bigger table available and when a 6th person came to join us, they refused to add a chair to our table. So we just grabbed the chair from the nearby empty table and accommodated ourselves. This really puzzles me: How can a restaurant refuse a customer that is joining a party? \nAfter they took 10 minutes to give us menus, they took another 45 minutes to serve our food after we ordered! Good thing we were all drinking alcohol and some of us were too drunk to notice the long wait. After eating quickly and asking for the bill, they took another 15 minutes to bring us the bill and the whole dinner took more than 2 hours because of the horrible service. \nI'm sorry sushi hunter, but even though you're one of the few japanese restaurants in North Beach, I would rather pay the extra money that was spent on the tiny amount of over priced sushi on a taxi ride down to the marina for some authentic japanese fare and welcoming service.", "author": "Florence T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-07-12", "description": "I had been to Sushi Hunter previous, but it had been a few years since I last ate there, so my memory was a bit fuzzy. While I don't remember it being anywhere near the best food in town, I remember it being reasonably good. Well, either my memory failed me horribly or the place has gone downhill, in either case, I will never return. Although the place was clean and the atmosphere was reasonably good, the waitress seemed bothered by any questions, including a simple one, like, \"is this appetizer enough for two people to split?\" She rolled her eyes and said, \"it's $6, it's small, I don't know if it's enough for two.\" Ok fine, I'm not expecting an entree-sized portion for $6, but is there not a more polite way of answering the question? Anyway, the food was bland and lukewarm, even though it was not busy at the time. As for the sushi, the fish was suspiciously mushy and the tuna appeared to have been put through a food processor before it was put on the roll. \n\nIn a city with more great restaurants than any one person can ever enjoy, I see no reason to make this part of your to-do list.", "author": "rob h."}
