(The Bar was very slow at this time).  Although the drinks are good here, there's plenty of bars in the area that makes great drinks + great service.

The place was clearly designed by someone with attention to detail. If you like Art Deco, you'll enjoy whiling away some time here. Sitting and listening to vintage tunes playing over their PA, it was hard to tell what era I was in. Five stars for environs!\n\nThe only downer was when I went to order a drink. I have a sensitive and quirky palate, so I hate bitters like alcohol and grapefruit. I asked the younger bartender about what mocktails they could make, like maybe a shrub soda. He didn't know what that was, so he asked the older bartender.\n\nThat guy said they didn't make those, so I asked him what mocktails he could make, specifically without any grapefruit or pineapple juice. I know that most people like pineapple juice. I told you I have a quirky palate! He verified that I didn't want any alcohol and became unfriendly and dismissive.\n\nI settled by ordering a Mexican coke when I really wanted a pretty drink I'd enjoy imbibing. I might end up here again if friends really want to go, but I'm not likely to suggest it. I travel for work and entertain customers, and I've been accommodated elsewhere with mocktails fitting my prerequisites.\n\nIf you love vintage and drink, you'll likely think this is a great place with classic cocktails. If you don't drink and attempt to order something not on the menu, I hope you get a friendlier reception!", "author": "Beth Ann G."}

While walking up (and I mean UP) Bush Street, we hear a man yelling out, \"Come on in! We're open for business!\"  Exchanging brief questioning looks, we decided to walk across the street and try this place out. \n\nTo me, walking in felt like I had walked into a Gotham City bar (from the 90's animated series).  One look inside, especially after seeing the restroom doors, you'll probably agree (if you're an old dude like me). \n\nAnyway, we ended up being more than glad we stopped in. Our bartender was super friendly and super knowledgeable about tending the bar (he took exception to us referring to him as merely a mixologist). He explained, in a very polite way that a bartender is an individual with a passion for making great drinks and creating well-balanced experiences, as opposed to merely mixing drinks. Who am I to question a man in a white suit, well groomed and versed in drinks? \n\nBeing a total newbie to mixed drinks (despite my age), I inquired as to the difference in alcohols and brands, mixers and mixed drinks.  He calmly and succinctly answered my many questions.  \n\nHe mixed up a mean Moscow Mule.  Next up, something called \"Odin's Whiskers\", which was equal parts sweet, strong and pleasant to drink. \n\nWe really enjoyed stopping in to this place.

Lol seriously though, he seems like he's the type that would take a lot of pride in his drinks, therefore would put the effort into making it great.\n\nIt took awhile for the bar back to take our order as he had to attend to others first.

The place is extremely small (with a small bar and a few small tables), like NYC bar small, a rarity I've found while living out here. It's very old school inside; reminds me of that classic \"Nighthawks\" painting for some reason. A lot of different drinks (NY Sour has the egg white, which is always a plus), but not a ton of variety on the bourbon side, which is my libation of choice. They make the standard Sazarac, etc, but thought they would have a little diversity with that particular spirit. Oh well, I had a few other non-bourbon cocktails that were good. \n\nSince it's small, and since SF is rarely coal-oven humid/hot like the entire Bay Area was on Labor Day weekend, this place was a sauna a few Fridays ago. Not the bar's fault, but just know if it's a hot day, it'll be hotter inside. Don't let this sully your opinion of the place though--very good, and recommended.", "author": "Dan M."}

He quizzed her on her birthday and her address and where in Pennsylvania she was from. She's from Johnstown, PA, ever heard of it sir?? I honestly thought he was joking.

I remember seeing Stookey's Club Moderne from the street while walking one night and thinking ...'this is the place that gets a solid 4+ stars on the Yelp scale?!' I just didn't think it looked like much! Yet in all my glorious, curious fashion to find what's amazing in my home city or one's that I frequent, I had to check it out. Upon entering Stookey's one feels that they are zipped all the way back to the post prohibition 1930's! I liked it immediately! The music was if that era and the decor was too.. even the bartenders were clothed in the fashion of that era. The drinks here aren't for the wallet conscious, but is anything in SF, really? Lucky enough to sit right up at the bar, I got to witness drinks being concocted with ease and flair, precision and grace. Much thought was placed into garnishment and the finishings of what looked like a perfect drink from my vantage point! BUT, one swipe of an orange peel ever so slight over the rim of an antique glass and I am learning the care these bartenders placed into each and every cocktail they artistically created. The bar was clean too.. NO mess of liquor sloshings all over a sticky back bar, ( I KNOW you KNOW what I am talking about.. because anyone that's been to a busy bar has seen that , and frankly that's hygienically , UN-hygienically gross.. how did any of us survive our drunk college 20's?!!) None of that here.. and even better, the very busy bartenders are nice and helpful to people like me that question ALL kinds of drinks. This place could easily be one of those snooty Nob Hill Union Square places .. I didn't witness that. They do a perfectly beautiful French 75 , (my choice), with just enough tart and just enough sparkling.. and it's not put into a martini glass. It's put into a beautiful antique glass that will likely remind you of your wealthy grandmother who had a million of these tucked away for cordials and the like! There is a cocktail of the month too .. January it's fittingly called , The Liberal. Oh SF! I had one of these amazing French 75 drinks .. and small with a kick that can sneak up on you is what I would call it.. I went back to my ever trusting champagne and yes, I did let my studious Charlie Chaplin look alike bartender with round eye glasses down with that order .. but that's okay.. I will be back to this place that pops you back to an era we have long forgotten ... but, not quite.. Thanks to Stookey's for that ! Cheers!", "author": "Kimberly V."}

The vibe is very retro and cool, and we like all of the small details like the light fixtures and old-fashioned coupes. The bar is never super crowded and we can usually get a spot at the bar. The bartenders are friendly but I wouldn't say they are necessarily attentive. We really appreciate their variety of traditional cocktails, like the Aviation and Gin Fizz. Between my husband and I, we've probably tried all of the drinks on the menu; my husband prefers the whiskey and tiki-esque drinks, and I'm partial to the gin and punch drinks. \n\nThe few things that keep me from coming here more often: 1. the bar has a bit of a sterile feel to it that can't really be explained. Perhaps it's too new and needs to be \"lived-in\" more? 2. the bathroom has a bit of a flushing problem. I've definitely had to let the bartender know more than once that the toilet wasn't flushing. Beyond those things, this bar is definitely worth checking out; it's a casual, yet classy spot for both group hangouts and dates.", "author": "Regina L."}

I had high hopes as the era of which is is reminiscent is my favorite and with the Presidio Social Club pedigree of the team behind it, I was certain the cocktails would be stellar.\n\nLet's start with the cocktails.  My companion had a Manhattan and I had a Sazerac.  They were both stellar.  No doubt about the quality of the drink program here, and at $12.50 a pop, in line from a cost perspective.  There were two bartenders working, a very nice woman and a stoic man who seemed to have checked his friendly demeanor at the door.  They could have done with just one bartender as I think there were only about six or seven people there on a Friday night around midnight.\n\nIf well-concocted cocktails were all that mattered at a bar, Club Moderne would get an entirely different review from me, but as we all know, it's often less about the cocktails and more about the ambiance.  This is where Club Moderne completely falls down.\n\nTrying to be \"post-Prohibition\" themed (1930s/40s) the decor tries really hard but comes off more as a Mel's Diner or Lori's Cafe than a mid-30s watering hole.  I think much of this is due to the terrible lighting.  Turn it down boys, no one wants to put on sunglasses to walk into a bar at midnight (or ever...).  The lighting feels more like Aisle 6 at Wal-Mart than an intimate cocktail lounge - and I'm pretty sure lighting this bright didn't even exist in that era.  While I have come to loathe them, these guys could do with some Edison bulbs.\n\nIt is obvious that the team has put a lot of thought into the decor and has done some work to bring in interesting period pieces and replica fixtures, but at the end of the day, it's all just too shiny and new to effectively convince anyone that they've stepped back in time.  (If you want to see a bar that does this seamlessly, check out Dear Irving in NYC).\n\nAnd finally, there is this weird thing going on with the semi-opaque portholes in the restroom doors.  First, who puts semi-opaque portholes in exposed restroom doors?  I don't want to see the silhouette of the dude from the corner peeing...or worse.  And I CERTAINLY don't want the entire bar to have the ability to see me in ANY way while using the restroom.  But then there's the weird blue glow of these odd portholes.  I watched it while we sipped our cocktails and was never able to figure out why it went on or off, but it did and I found it not only very strange but also highly distracting.\n\nMaybe this is a better spot for pre-dinner drinks as it is very quiet and empty, apparently all the time.  But if you're looking for an intimate spot to enjoy a fantastic cocktail there are about 100 better places in SF.", "author": "Stacy H."}

My traveling companion and I got in at 11:30pm on a Sunday, and discovered the definition of perfection.\n\nIt's the kind of bar so loaded with atmosphere and style that it doesn't need to be pitch-black to have ambiance - it's just pleasantly dimmed. The streamline modern style is elegant and fresh and truly unique in the world of cocktail bars I've experienced. \n\nThe menu is perfect. Brief, but varied. We each had three drinks (thanks to Uber making that possible) and they were each fantastic. I could easily see myself making a point to travel through the menu, and damn the consequences the next day. The bartender was friendly, attentive and skilled. I'm sure he could have made anything I'd asked for in the way of the classics, but I didn't see much reason to venture off the menu - I'd never had a 20th Century (oh, let's be honest, I'd never even heard of it) and I think it's my new favorite drink. \n\nI'm bored of dives.

Now what I want is a quiet place to have a drink, talk, and enjoy the atmosphere, not a noisy, barely-lit cavern filled with shouting techbros drinking the latest $37, 13-shot gimmick called the \"Jabba the Mutt\" out of wooden buckets painted with the bar's desperate logo-- a graphic smirk, like: \"DRANK,\" perhaps, or \"POUND,\" or maybe \"DON'T VOM, BRO.\" No. If you're looking for a place where you, Matt, Josh, and Tyler can get waaaaaasted after your 14 hour day of coding and playing CoD at Evixxxtion Apps, go elsewhere.\n\nStookey's Club Moderne is a gorgeously decorated, elegant, art deco beauty with a fantastic menu of no-nonsense vintage cocktails, beautifully crafted by co-owner Tim Stookey, a well-known SF bartender who earned his renown tending bar at the Presidio Social Club, and his excellent staff. The bar's post-prohibition decor is on point-- every tiny detail has been attended to. LOOK UP AT THE LIGHT FIXTURES. Look at the molding. If, like me, you were happy to spend an hour in line for Tower of Terror because you needed more time to look at the decor, you'll be happy here. Unlike Tower of Terror, however, (and too many bars to mention) Stookey's Club Moderne is pristine. Everything's clean, sleek, and gorgeous-- even the bartenders are spiffy and elegant in white coats and ties. \n\nThe bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. Stookey himself is one of the city's experts in vintage cocktails, and that's reflected in the menu, full of well-known vintage drinks like the Highball, as well as lesser-known drinks that well deserve a comeback, such as the Sazerac. My favorite part of the menu, though, has to be the fact that the non-alcoholic beverages are listed as \"Temperance Drinks.\" See what I mean? On. Point.\n\nIf you want to experience post-prohibition, 1930s San Francisco, have a beautiful, vintage cocktail at a reasonable price, and a nice, quiet chat with a friend or six, this is the place.", "author": "Melissa H."}

Oh my word! I was totally charmed by this cozy elegant lounge. My taste buds were in heaven from delicious cocktails. The ambiance, the many classy, beautifully dressed people in period dress, the sleek lines, the authentic 1930's touches, it was all quite charming . \nOK, now down to the drinks: I tried a good number of the cocktails with my friend - all delicious. I started with the Aviation. Oh, that creme de violette was wonderful, and the lavender blue cocktail in the period glassware enhanced the experience. The 20th Century, Blood and Sand, Pan American Clipper, Corpse Reviver #2 and the Brunelle followed throughout the evening. Top three for me were the Brunelle, Corpse Reviver & the Aviation, but all the drinks were very good. My friend & I noticed all the period piece decor and architectural touches inside the bar, which was easy to do with the comfortably dimmed light (this is not a dark, loud bar). There is period 1930's music playing in the background. I like to be able to see people, architectural lines & artwork, and hear conversation over drinks in bars, so the atmosphere was good for me. The bartenders were dressed elegantly in white. Service was good. The evening was delightful, and I was very sad to have to leave early on a Saturday night, to take the last BART train across the bay. I will return here again on my next trip to SF.

Because of this, Stookey is considered a bartender's bartender, and it certainly shows in the drinks served here.\n\nIf you are looking for a quiet spot to have a relaxing drink, Stookey's is the place for you.

Their bartenders were very friendly. The interior is decent. Art Deco style but not over the top. They haven't installed their A/C yet, so it was quite hot inside. Hopefully they'll fix that soon.", "author": "Alfred L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-22", "description": "First, I should clarify I am a pretty picky about bars. I want tasty cocktails with top shelf hooch, a nice ambiance, a place where I can sit and have a drink or chat with a companion and for a reasonable price. But I don't like TVs (volume on or off), places that are on trend and more about a gimmick than just sitting down with a drink or so crowded you have to shout over the din of 75 other people and sound like you smoked a pack of unfiltered ciggies the next day. \n\nWhen I first came across Stookey's on the corner of Bush and Taylor, I was a bit suspicious. It seemed overly bright inside, like someone was going to be performing an alien autopsy, and I wasn't sure if they were a bar or a place to eat. So for the first few months it was open (and it hasn't been open long), I didn't even set food inside. Months wasted. \n\nBut on the recommendation of a friend, and seeing they had put in some gels to dim the lights, I popped in one night. It's a young spot, they don't have a specific crowd yet, but they make delicious cocktails and have a nice selection of top shelf booze - your Tempus Fugit liquors, Glengoyne scotch, a variety of nice gins, a great selection of bitters, etc. If you want the well vodka with whatever or something with a maraschino cherry or anything just to get buzzed, this is not your place. They are aiming for craft and quality. But if you are into ambiance, they are trying to bring back the old school service: the waiters make you think of the bar from the Shining, but in a good, not murdering your family way, the glassware makes you feel like you are at a private houseparty in the 30s, and it is all well thought out. And the selection of cocktails are well-chosen (although you can order other things, too). And the pricing is what you would spend on a tasty cocktail anywhere else in the city, sometimes, it's even a little less. The place is small with a long L-shape bar and a few tables, but you can sit and chat with the knowledgeable bar staff (who have had tenure at spots all over the City) or with your friends or stare at your phone, if you wish.  \n\nIt's a nice spot. And they are planning a few future events that take advantage of their high quality, unrushed aesthetic. I'm hoping it stays around. If you know your Savoy cocktails and want a tasty, well made cocktail in a spot with no televisions and no blaring music, this is the place for you. And as it seasons with time, (I think it has only been open 4 months) I suspect it will get even better. Viva Stookey's Corpse Reviver #2!", "author": "M. M."}

My favorite bartender is Tim.  The drinks are crafted without attitude and in a really amazing environment.  The detail of the interior even down to the music makes for a delightful experience. The drinks are served in unique glasses in keeping with the type of cocktail ordered, super nice touch. So happy to welcome Stookey's to the neighborhood!", "author": "Elaina S."}

Real drinks done with care and precision.  (They do measure everything.)  One downside is that it can get quite loud when there are loud people in there.  They also don't have any food options which is a bummer.  We will certainly return though because we loved the bartender and the vibe of the place.", "author": "J J."}

It was Christmas Eve and we were having trouble locating places that weren't closed early for the holidays, after several phone calls to places on our \"list\" we landed on this bar on Google Maps, so we gave them a call, and the bartender that answered the phone said \"of course we are open this evening, and we are toasting Tom & Jerry at 10pm\" ... so of course we were intrigued enough to walk the few blocks from our hotel to check out this bar! We walked into Stookey's and were welcomed with a 1950's Soda Fountain type of set up, with Old Fashioned Christmas Tree Lights hung around the bar which gave it the most perfect holiday feel. It was pretty quiet as we'd expected it to be on Christmas Eve, but the bartender was excellent, and helpful with suggestions. For whatever reason, I was in the mood for Rum, and ordered an \"Old Cuban\" while my boyfriend asked for a suggestion and was recommended an Eggnog Cocktail with Scotch, and they were both delicious! We were still intrigued by this whole \"Tom and Jerry ordeal\" wondering if some cartoonists were going to walk into the door any minute, or a mouse and a cat, or two famous bar patrons, so we decided to order another drink and settle in and wait until 10pm. At about 9:50 we asked the bartender what exactly was happening at 10pm and he told us about a traditional holiday drink called a Tom & Jerry and that the owner was making a batch of them for the holidays, so of course... we stayed for a 3rd cocktail and waited. \n\nWe watched the owner, who was with his friends, all dressed up in 1950s fashion begin to concoct the drinks from scratch using real eggs, sugar, milk and ingredients. and to top it off they had an antique \"Tom and Jerry\" cocktail set that the drinks were poured into. It was delicious, well worth the wait! We had two cups each before deciding that we'd better go find some food before everything shut down for the evening!\n\nWe had two bartenders during our visit, both experts at their craft and both incredibly professional and making this \"themed\" location seem all that more real. It was the perfect spot for Christmas Eve and we felt so festive and cozy in this little bar. \n\nThe Old Cuban and Mai Tai were both excellent, although I'd definitely recommend the Cuban first, and the Eggnog Scotch Martinis were excellent. And if you happen to be in the city next Christmas Eve... I'd recommend dressing up and heading over for a Tom & Jerry!", "author": "L B."}
