In that set, I got the curry rice with the pork katsu. (I wanted to get curry rice with shrimp tempura, because I just had a feeling that their pork katsu would be subpar, but I was told that the shrimp tempura only comes with 2 shrimp.)\n\nThe curry was bland, far more diluted than any other Japanese curry I've had. Funnily enough, they have squash in the curry. The rice was also mushy; personally I'm okay with that, but if I'm not mistaken, that's a no-no for Japanese cuisine, and it's also a waste of fine Japanese round-grain rice. The katsu was also dry and bland on the inside.\n\nFor some great curry with katsu, I'd recommend Guru Katsu in Mountain View.", "author": "Albert Z."}

Decided to dine in at Kui Shin Bo since waiting in line for Marafuku and having crepes for lunch was not an option.\n\nThe small shop is dimly lit, not in an intimate or calming way, it's a bit run down and lacks in natural light. There were a few people dining in and was seated in the awkwardly quiet shop. Wanted just a bit of food to get blood sugar back up and be on our way, touring the city and opted for the \"pick two\" lunch with Curry Rice and Chicken Katsu. The lunch came with salad and miso soup. \n\nThe Curry Rice was pale in color, lacking in flavor and vegetarian. You can probably have better-tasting curry from the premade packets from Japanese grocery stores. The Chicken Katsu was equally as bland and the batter fell off the dry, unseasoned chicken. Even dipped in the curry, both flavorless did nothing even with that combination. Salad was okay, basic mix with a sweet dressing.\n\nService was a bit slow and prices here are cheap, however, you are definitely getting what you pay for here ... maybe even less quality for what you are paying for, tbh.

For such a small place, they have a huge menu. Pretty much anything you can think of in Japanese cuisine you can find it here. They have appetizers, sushi, sashimi, ramen, udon, and rice dishes. I got the Shio Ramen with mild spiciness while my friend got the Hamachi kama; we also got the nigiri combo to share. The broth for the ramen is nothing eye-opening, but the chashiu was pretty good. The nigiris are so-so, not much to comment on. The service was rather slow, they didn't take our order until we had called them like 3 times and the food comes out pretty slow as well. \n\n \n\nOverall, I have to say this place is not one of the places that wow'd me and made me feel like I have to come back again, but the wide range of selections is definitely a plus.", "author": "Rachel G."}

A newer neighborhood for where we often congregate, I found myself slightly lost. This is the problem of having friends you know from 20 plus years ago, you tend to revert back to that person you were back then, you let others make decisions for you when it comes to food because you didn't care about food back then. So I was led, as I was often led by him back then, we came to a restaurant that he was familiar with and I was not. It's a typical cafe style restaurant with two locations, one near where he used to live, which I think was the main reason he chose this place, one in Japantown, which was the one we visited that evening. \n\nThis restaurant has been in the city for sometime, I think the menu is fairly basic, not your usual fancy pants new Japanese cuisine, it has all of your stables: sushi, rolls, sashimi, katsu and teriyaki. The dinner menu reminded me of the 1990s or early 2000s of San Francisco, taken as a whole felt rather nostalgic, as we've been friends and had eaten sushi together since late 90's. We ordered the meal like we would back then, a bit of everything: sashmi, katsu and teriyaki. Food came rather quickly, the soup and the salad to boot. I also had my eyes on cold agedashi tofu which I thought was a decent appetizer.\n\nThe restaurant felt quiet on a week night. At 7:30 only a few locals trickled in to grab a meal. We sat together as we would often do, being both left handed helped. He said that he's taken his sister here to eat, and she had liked it. I think it's the sister who had lived in Japan. The service was fast and non fussy, the quality on par with what you'd expect, and the price extremely reasonable. A person came in to try to order something but the kitchen was closed, I heard the server say. They are strict on closing time.\n\nThe fog was rolling in. It's one of those typical winter San Francisco evenings. We ate quickly and quietly, leaving just before the very last person. I am content and satisfied.

So when I asked the other Japanese customers who made Benkyo-do- their local hangout where I should dine, they all pointed to the proprietress who told me how to get to Kuishimbo. \n\nKuishimbo in Japanese means glutton.

Truly a 4+ Yelp experience the many times I went there. \n\nI went back in 2012 and found out that he & his wife had sold the restaurant to another owner. The Kuishimbo I cherished had disappeared.

Just went to lunch there today and the wait was very slow for the food to come. For some reason, the other three tables that was seated later than my table received their food first! All the tables were occupied, but there was no sense of urgency by the staff. The kitchen staff and the service staff could be seen chatting and food was just trickling out. Only one dish at a time would be coming out and alot of time between each dish of at least ten minutes each. Water was never filled or offered for refills. Any service needed after you ordered required flagging down the two servers.\n Food quality was awful as the chicken katsu was tepid in temperature and the bread coating was too crunchy and no taste to it. I could tell it was old chicken that was used to make this dish and the tempura batter was old. Salad was bland even with the dressing and it was was obvious that the lettuce was not fresh. Beef Teriyaki was chewy in texture and also tasted and looked like day or two day old meat was utilized to make the dish. The only saving grace was the Vegetable Tempura which was fresh vegetables and fried to perfection. \n Seriously not trying to impress their customers or expecting fresh ingredients as necessary for their food. Only expect mediocre or poor food expectations and slow to non existent service by the staff if you chose to dine here. Expect better food and service at one of the other food establishments in the area.", "author": "V. P."}

Talking about me? \n*(kuishinbo in Japanese means a person who loves to eat excessively or a glutton)\n\nA great Japanese chef once owned Kui Shin Bo back in the early 90s. His forte was cooked food and not so much sushi. I have not been back after he sold his business. While visiting Japantown during the Cherry Blossom festival, I was more than thrilled to revisit Kui Shin Bo out of sheer nostalgia. Golly, nothing in the interior has changed since the 90s! It looked pretty rundown today. Kui Shin Bo is tucked away on the 2nd floor in an unobtrusive corner of Miyako Mall. I was anxious to see if Kui Shin Bo can still be regarded as a hidden gem. Yes, it is still hidden in that forgotten corner but sadly, I wouldn't now call it a gem.\n\nWe started off with the healthy Kinpira Gobo ($5.49) where root veggies like gobo (burdock root) and carrots were first julienned and then saut\u00e9ed and simmered in sugar and soy sauce. Gobo had a distinctive earthy flavor giving the dish some sweetness and a nice bite. Kui Shin Bo's version was decent if a tad dry. For the health conscious, gobo is loaded with minerals and high in fiber. (3/5)\n\nFeast your eyes on the Chilean Sea Bass Butter Yaki ($17.99). It is guaranteed to make any fish lover drool! It looked like it was delicately pan-fried and perfectly grilled judging from the flakey meat and the beautiful grill marks on the fish. The taste was divine. It was mild, rich and buttery. The fish had a slightly charred crispy surface without losing lusciousness. The presentation though appeared slipshod like the fish was plopped haphazardly on a disorganized bed of bean sprouts and corn. Nevertheless, this was a great complete dinner as rice, miso and salad came with the entr\u00e9e. (4/5)\n\nOkonomiyaki ($10.99) can be addictive.  I just had one a week ago at Izumiya (also in Japantown) and I was craving for it again. I was hoping that Kui Shin Bo could come up with a better rendition. For the uninformed, okonomiyaki is a savory and hearty Japanese pancake griddled with everything from cabbage, pork and soba to fried eggs and \"dancing\" dried bonito flakes. Goddamn! I was hard pressed to pick the winner except to say Izumiya has the edge only because Kui Shin Bo's version was too gloriously lathered in sauces, the sauces being Worcestershire or Tonkatsu sauce and Kewpie mayo. (3/5)\n\nTenzaru Soba ($10.49) is a wonderful summer dish that is light and refreshing. It combines 2 well-known Japanese dishes: Shrimp Tempura with veggies and cold soba (buckwheat) noodles served on a bamboo dish. My big gripe was the tempura batter was too heavy as the goal is a light, crisp coating so that the pieces of shrimp and veggie don't absorb oil when fried. By the way, you can forget about Miss Manners when eating soba. It is perfectly OK to slurp your noodles loudly to your heart's content! (3/5)\n\nThe servers were courteous but faintly aloof. The interior requires a makeover as all I can say is there is no ambiance. If all you care about are the low prices and a little better than mediocre food (with the exception of the Chilean Sea Bass), then Kui Shin Bo is your place!", "author": "Geoff G."}

Both food and service were bad.\n\nFirst there's a line so we put our name down. When we check in half an hour later, boyfriend asks a worker for an estimated wait time. Worker asks what's our name and then says we're next. 5-10 minutes pass and a different worker comes out and calls a different name and seats them even though we were told we would be seated next.... Whatever, miscommunication, it happens, we're seated 10 minutes later.\n\nWe ordered that roll that has fish inside and the cucumber outside which was okay. Its good if you're going Paleo or trying to cut out rice. Now the dish that I do NOT recommend: ama ebi shrimp for $13ish dollars. I'm so upset at one the price and two the explicit sub par quality. The shrimp tastes as if it was just boiled in garlic water and then served with the chopped garlic. I'm so mad they ruined an ingredient that is naturally delicious.", "author": "Mimi T."}

If you order the ramen as an entree, the bf noticed that you def get more -- he was eyeing a chick and her noodles as she sat across from him.

They have a lunch special everyday where you can pick 2 items from a white board menu - they all come with miso soup, salad, and sometimes rice (if you get ramen or the garlic noodles you do not get rice). We also ordered their karaage as an appetizer.\n\nI ordered the combo with the tempura squid and saba mackerel. Mackerel was nicely grilled and super flavorful - the skin and meat were delicious. No need for sauce at all, though I did squeeze the accompanying lemon. There are bones, so be careful when eating. Luckily I eat a lot of non-filet seafood that I'm used to picking out bones.\n\nI was a little surprised at the squid tempura, but I guess the super Filipino in me expected little squid tentacles deep fried in batter. Instead they looked more like onion rings, where the squid was cut up into rings, tempura battered, and fried. It was a bit oily and honestly nothing amazing, even with the tempura sauce and dashi. The squid was chewy and kept separating from the batter.\n\nMy friend ordered the tonkatsu and garlic eggg noodles - in his case, it didn't come with rice because of the noodles. The tonkatsu was awesome, the pork moist and crunchy and I loved how they gave a bottle of tonkatsu sauce to go with it (some places just don't drizzle enough). The garlic egg noodles were surprisingly good! I thought they'd be pretty plain (I see garlic noodles at a lot of Bay Area places), but they were very garlicky and had some minced pork in it too. They also came with some hot chili garlic sauce on the side, which went really well with the noodles for an extra kick.\n\nSadly, their chicken karaage wasn't too special... somehow the chicken was pretty dry, and I can only describe their breading as \"chalky\" with potato starch. Weird. I wouldn't recommend as there are other places that do a really good job at karaage, and this just isn't one of them.\n\nAnother thing that is weird about this place is the food delivery - when it is ready, they will bring it to your table. Some people like their food fresh, but it's a little weird when your companion's food doesn't arrive at the same time, and it can feel impolite to eat it right away while your friend is still waiting. \n\nI noticed this with other tables where a guy started eating his food, and i was under the assumption his companion had not ordered anything. About halfway through the first guy's meal, his friend got his meal. The same happened with me, but luckily my friend is a super fast eater anyways... so it was probably better that I got a head start. Just keep that in mind if you're in a large group, since this was consistent at the other tables I observed.\n\nAnyways, definitely recommend this place for lunch while exploring Japantown. The food is good (assuming you order the right things) and cheap... but they still accept credit card. ;) I'd say it's more of a 3.5, but rounding up because the price is right.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

It's a little hole in the wall in the corner of the mall, with about 10 tables. We were a party of 3 and at first they sat us at a 2 person table and pulled up a chair on the side. They wanted us to get seated right away which we appreciated. They handed us menus and got us some water. However, when a 4 person table opened up, they offered us to move to be more comfortable. My boyfriend ordered he Mad Spicy Ramen, I got a caterpillar roll, and a sake nigiri, and my sister got the dynamite roll and the real California roll. Our only complaint is that the ramen came out instantly and the rolls came out about 25 minutes later. They did forewarn us about the timing but i just don't see why they couldn't wait to start the ramen when our rolls were being started to allow for them to come out at the same time. Otherwise, the food was delicious. The ramen was good, but wasn't super spicy like we were hoping. We got a Level 2 spice. It seemed like they only use chili flakes to make the soup spicier. The caterpillar was sweet with a touch of honey, which I like, but others may not, so beware. The dynamite and the real California rolls were good; my sister has no further comments.

For the next hour, you could see the line slowly accumulate outside, so definitely get here early if you plan on eating at this particular place.\n\nI'm not sure if this restaurant is slow, understaffed, or they hand-make their ramen noodles one by one... but once we ordered, it was another 20-25 minutes until I got my ramen. My cousin's food came first, which was a shame because obviously he was going to wait for my food to arrive, but it took forever. I had ordered the spicy ramen, which was delicious and worth the wait. The staff here is also very friendly, so it was a pleasant experience, but perhaps I was feeling impatient that day.\n\nThe food here is reasonably priced, and they have an impressive selection of food on their menu (including specials) so if you are venturing to eat in Japantown, I would add Kui Shin Bo to your list of considerations.

There seemed to only be one waitress going around to all the tables, which worked because the restaurant was so small. The service was quick, and food came especially quick for us because the sushi was being made in front of us. \n\nI have to note that the menu has a LOT of different things. They have sushi, udon/ramen, donburi bowls, yakitori, and more. We got the nigiri combo, salmon mango roll, and baked scallop roll. They each had 8 pieces, which was good for 3 people to share. The sushi tasted fresh and well made, especially the nigiri combo. I liked the salmon mango roll as well because of the sauces. To be honest, I didn't really like the baked scallop but that may have been personal preference. \n\nI never really eat in the East Mall, so it was great to try this place.

It had a good amount of crunch and flavor, but you could still taste the sashimi.  The tempura udon broth was a bit too wakame flavored in my opinion, I usually like it with more dashi flavoring.  However it was still good, and the tempura was yummy.", "author": "Nina W."}

He says it's \"the best Japanese restaurant in the city\" \n\nThere are 2 reasons why someone keeps coming back to the same restaurant:\n1. they love the food for taste\n2. they appreciate the value\n\nThis particular instance definitely falls under bucket two. While the girls in the group can't understand why this place was recommended as they normally only focus on category one restaurants, all the guys said they'd be back for more. $9.99 for a 2-item bento box meal is pretty hard to find in the city, especially in a popular area like Japantown. i can definitely see how it's very enticing. Under normal conditions, I would rate Kui Shin Bo 3 stars for food quality, but the staff was extremely nice and I'll add 1 stars for the boys. \n\nIn conclusion:  If you're female, you'll probably want your boy to take you somewhere with tastier but less cost-efficient food. If you're male, don't let your girlfriend read yelp reviews until after dinner and save some money on date night!", "author": "Annie Z."}

In sum on our choose two deal, we got a brown avocado roll, cold tofu and chicken and bad service on Saturday night.  \n\nOn the menu you had different kinds of noodles, rice bowls and sushi and I thought that these were reasonably priced for San Francisco.  And!  They had this choose two w/ miso, rice and salad for $10.99 deal.  Everything on the menu looked great, but my boyfriend and I ordered the choose two deal.  \n\nFor me, I got an avocado roll with agedashi tofu.  My avocado roll was brown, which I know that just because the avocado is brown doesn't mean its spoiled.  But I'm an avocado roll enthusiast.  Over the years, I've never been served a brown avocado roll.  It just looks bad.  Still tasted okay for brown avocado.  The salad was good.  The miso was good.  Then I started with the agedashi tofu.  I thought the tofu was cold because I ate everything else really slow.  But turns out, these guys just like serving cold food.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered chicken teriyaki and a California roll.  The avocado in his California roll was green.  I'm not mad.  BUT!  He told me after we left that his chicken was cold.  And that part of his rice was cold.  I guess he didn't want me to stop him from eating it, because he still ate it.  But how are you going to be serving people cold food?  \n\nMaybe the cold food and brown avocado roll I got was limited to the choose two deal.  For the people who ordered noodles or the rice bowl,  all of their food looked pipping hot!  \n\nAside from the food, we got pretty bad service on a Saturday night.  It was turning into a busy Saturday, and its a small restaurant with what seems to be two servers, one sushi maker and whoever was cooking in the back!  So while I understand that it was busy, I don't find that its an excuse for missed drinks orders and no refills on water.  \n\nMaybe I'd come back for noodles or rice bowls, but it was a bad first impression and there's a lot of other places to choose from in Japantown.  I mean, who serves brown avocado rolls?", "author": "Cristina C."}

Ready?\n\nSo, I told my friend there is no where in Japantown that tastes good. She's just as picky as I am when it comes to food, prob even more than me. She said \"cmon stop being so negative, it's prob not that bad, as you describe\". I should have been more adamant NOT to eat in Jtown... \n\nOk fine. Let's try the one and only place in Jtown that has 4 star Yelp review with 364 reviews. Can't be that bad. Can't be. \n\n... Ok wait for 20 min. \nThey asked if I wanted hot tea or water, I said can I have both, they said they would have to charge me... Ok... I'll take tea. \nTried to order sushi. Said it in Japanese, slowly, like the menu has it written. Waiter could not understand it. Had to say \"N11, N8\"... No one in here is Japanese....\n\"Oh and no wasabi please\" I said, he said \"that's ok, it comes on the side\"... Came on top. Now my fish tastes like wasabi. \nThe fish literally ripped every time I picked it up. It tasted like frost bite. They were all mush, and small little pieces. Maguro was also fake. I can get better sushi at Safeway, which I already don't buy. The fish was literally like 2 weeks old. I would have rather ate a tunafish sandwich that was sitting out in the sun for a day. \n\nWorst part was, the rice smelled like dirty sour dish towel and made me almost vomit. Not one area of rice. Alllllllllll our rice. When I would bring the food to my face to eat it, it smelled so offensive. I literally gagged and could only eat a couple bites of the rice. \n\nMy friend ordered the sushi sashimi plate and shabu x2. The shabu x2 came in a hot pot, chunks of weird meat. Already cooked. In some sort of weird broth. I called them over (now I'm pissed and I have a lot of patients) and was like, what is this... Sent it away. You should have seen our faces. We both barely ate. \n\nAsked for the check. They said they took the shabu x2 off (duh!!!), but then charged us something random for $16. We told him we didn't order this. He said oops my mistake, I mispushed the button. He tried to argue the sushi when we didn't even wanna bring it up. My friend got pissed and said while pointing at me \"she's Japanese from Japan!!!\" They guy looked at my face and made a \"nah whatever\" face at me and shooed with his hand. Omg, let me throw this food at your face!!!! Plus he was talking to this other waitress in a different language in front of me? Don't wanna say it in English huh? GTFOH. \n\nIn the end, we barely ate, spent $60 between 2 of us. And my friend got Diarrhea. \nWorst sushi in my entire life, and I am traumatized for a while now. \n\nI warn you.

I was exhausted and I had to be up to leave for the airport at 3am. Instead of powering through like I normally would do (go out and just not go to sleep) I decided to attempt to be responsible and opted for a night in in my hotel room with PJs and delivery. This proved to be a pretty great call thanks to Eat24 and Kui Shin Bo.\n\nIt was a Thursday night so the wait for the food was a bit significant (almost an hour and a half) but luckily I ordered before I was starving. Coming from the midwest where sushi isn't always the best I decided to try a few things and ended up with WAY more food than I needed but that's ok.\n\nFirstly I was kind of dumb and didn't realize that the Rainbo'rrito was an actual sushi burrito. I mean the name says it all but I guess I missed the category when I was ordering on Eat24 so I just assumed it was a standard size roll. Nope, it's a burrito. And it's much larger than a roll. But it was delicious and I made sure to make a sizeable dent in it before moving onto my next roll--the Salmon Family (crispy salmon skin topped with fresh salmon, ikura, avocado, mango and cream cheese with lemon yuzu sauce) which was also a solid win. Salmon is definitely my favorite of all the raw fish options (next to the always expensive fatty tuna) so I was in heaven with this one.\n\nWould I do it again? ABSOLUTELY. The fish is fresh, the combo of ingredients in each roll are great, and for this midwest gal it was the perfect end to a long week in SF.", "author": "Annette J."}

I've been here a couple times now and service is pretty unorganized. The reason I would give this place another star would be because once my friend mentioned that the owner seemed enthusiastic to show him how to eat his order and the grilled fish items are rather tasty.\n\nHere's what's not ok: I came here with 2 friends and 2 of us order things off of the mix and match $9.99 menu+ nigiri($4.25) and the other ordered a roll. The bento items came out first and that is fine because we understand things are made at different times but we repeatedly had to ask for the status of the sushi roll. It took about 40+ minutes for that sushi roll to come out and by that time the bento people were finished eating. Not ok.\n\nThe food: like I said, the grilled fish/fried fish items are yum. The salmon nigiri was poorly made and did not taste good at all. My friend waited 40 minutes for her salmon family roll that she has gotten multiple times so she knows what goes in it. When it finally arrived, my friend had eaten 1 piece and then we found it was missing the cream cheese. We told the owner and he brought over the person who made it who insisted it was inside. We had to literally open up the roll and show him he was lying. I'm personally not a fan of cream cheese in a roll but there are those who are and if you are going to list it as having it in there, then it should be as such. Instead of taking the roll back the owner wanted to bring a side of cream cheese and seemed hesitant to do anything to rectify the problem at all. Not cool. Let's remember that the 2 other people at the table have already finished eating. They finally took back the roll and we thought they would remake it but it was very obvious they just took the same roll and peeled everything off and put it back on. Even to the point that the roll was short 2 pieces. Unappealing and unappetizing.\n\nTake a little pride in your craft please.", "author": "Jessica C."}

The Nigiri Combos comes with all your standard selections including tuna, salmon, shrimp, snapper, hamachi and mackerel.

This one was the exact opposite. First, it was served on a plate, not a bowl. The curry was thickened with either corn starch, old tempura, or noodles. This gave it a very slimy texture.

All and all, I can say that the star of the show was most definitely the ramen. It was packed to the brim with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, nori (seaweed), chashu roasted pork, green onions and topped with an egg. The broth was a special garlic tonkatsu broth, which I had altered to a spice level of 3 out of 4. Each bite felt so full and hearty, there was always something interesting to pick out of my bowl! I do want to say that although this is advertised as a garlic ramen, the sole garlic provider in this equation is the broth. In my case, this was perfect as I don't like overdoing it on the garlic.\n\nThe gyoza proved to be the perfect intermittent snack. The dipping sauce acted as a pallet cleanser, salting my tongue and washing in preparation for more ramen. The gyoza itself was alright, however the dipping sauce definitely carried the duo.\n\nAll in all, I give this place five stars for a few reasons. The first of them being VALUE. Your money goes far here, and there plenty of options for those who don't have the largest budget (customizable combo plates all day long, special meals and cheap deals over all).

The nabeyaki is pretty big, with lots of udon, but not a lot of toppings (a tempura and some cabbage, with some small bits of chicken). That's kind of expected due to the cheap prices.\n\nOverall, this place feels like a family restaurant--it feels like I went to a friend's place and they cooked some homemade stuff. Nothing fancy, but clearly simply cooked and in big portions, with not a lot of crazy seasoning.\n\nA good place to stop by if you're craving simple homemade Japanese stuff", "author": "Henry L."}

They didn't offer us any water or paid attention to our table. We were ready to order, but they have not notice us until we had to flag a server down. All I got as a response is not a \"sorry,\" but \"oh.\" It's a small shop, I don't understand how you don't notice your customers. Keep in mind, it was not busy at all. We came in around 230pm, there were few tables occupied. \n\nWhen we ordered, the server somewhat gave us an attitude and wasn't welcoming at all. I ordered the Miso ramen, and I read the description for it.. it either offered Chashu Roasted Pork or Chicken, so of course, I let them know I wanted the roasted pork option, but he replied with \"what do you mean? You can't have two item together.\" I know there's just a Chashu Ramen, I want the Miso Ramen with the chashu roasted pork meat as my option in my soup, not the Chashu Ramen. \n\nI'm very disappointed in the service and it was our first time here given that it's a 4 star restaurant on yelp. I wanted to like this place, but it gave me the vibe that they didn't want us here. I would've rather just got up and walked off, but I wanted to wait and see if the food here is tasty. \n\nThe broth of the Miso ramen was average, not bad. The meat was a bit hard to chew.

I'm from the midwest and I love sushi.  Problem is, it takes a lot longer for the fish to get to your plate and of course its expensive compared to coastal areas who aren't burdened with importing.  I noticed a significant increase in the quality of sushi I was getting in Fresno compared to St. Louis (I assume this is because it spends less time on a truck), so out of curiosity I googled which city had the best rated sushi in the US with a strong hunch already as to who it was.  I wasn't surprised at all that it seems pretty across the board that San Francisco is the best sushi city.  I knew I had to have sushi there when I could so on this trip I got on Yelp and looked around.  I was on a budget so I looked for the lowest price, highest rated and ended up here.  I got there a couple minutes before opening and they welcomed me and I sat down in the corner.  They were very friendly, didn't have the thai tea I'm used to having with my sushi in the midwest and fresno, probably cause they stick with Japanese only stuff, which is cool with me.  I got the hot tea they had instead (don't remember which one), which was great.  Had a strong sesame like flavor in there that I really liked.  Dude kept coming by and refilling it before I could ever finish a cup off.  That's my favorite thing anybody that serves me can do, keep my drink from going empty.  I ordered the assorted sushi which was reasonably priced, and even at expensive sushi joints (especially at expensive sushi joints), I prefer the classics.  Rolls are a whole lot of flash to me.  Nigiri, fish on rice, is my shit.  It came with a basic cucumber and tuna roll with 6 pieces of nigiri.  I mean, I'm sure there's probably better sushi places in SF if you wanna pay more, but it sure as hell was the best sushi I've ever ate so far.  That in combination with amazing service and a reasonable price gets this place a 5 from me.  The fish was so fresh, I've never experienced it like that before.  The  himachi (yellowtail) was so fresh it didn't have that super fishy taste that never bothered me, but my wife hates.  None of the fish did.  Its like that fish died the day before or that morning or something.  Thanks for that experience guys, really appreciated it.", "author": "Dane N."}

Don't get me wrong, I love writing reviews but for a little time period, I just gave up on... everything.\n\nAnyways that's a moot point now, today I'm here to write about Kui Shin Bo. \n\nA little backstory. I find a lot of restaurants in Japan town underwhelming. Especially the handful I've tried so I just stopped going. However one of my good friends had the opportunity to try this establishment with his lady and he swore by this place. I tried about 5 times on separate occasions to patron this place but it was always closed.\n\nI almost gave up until my friend was like, 'let's try to go today' and it was opened.\n\nWe were promptly greeted and shown a table, it's a fairly small establishment so the owner (I'm guessing) can easily see what is going on. There is a special's white board that had a handful of items and menus with sushi, and entrees. My friend has been there like 4 million times since he discovered it and knows the owner very well and always orders the same thing, while I perused the menu for sushi as he swore by it.\n\nFirst time we went, he ordered the special with vegetable curry and chicken katsu. I ordered:\n\nAmaebi\nHotate\nSake (salmon) nigri\nUnagi Nigri\nSpecial Dragon Roll\nBaked Salmon Roll\n\nI can see why their ratings are a bit low, they sell sushi but their strong point isn't sushi. The amaebi was good, and the fried head was battered and fried wonderfully. The Hotate, and Sake was nothing special. The Dragon roll had a very nicely fried tempura shrimp inside, other than that it was alright. And the baked salmon roll (probably a lion king) was questionable since there was flour on top. For some reason their rice, it doesn't taste right for sushi rice, it's cold, and a bit difficult to eat.\n\n'But you gave them 4 stars, why?'\n\nThe service rocks!\n\nNo just kidding. I don't like rating an establishment based on service. I mean I would like to point out their service rocks, but the 4 stars is for their specials/entrees. \n\nI tried my friend's chicken katsu and it was wonderful. Like only a handful of places wins my love for their chicken katsu and this place hands down is the best. Crispy panko fried with juicy non-chewy flavorful interior. Heck you don't even need the katsu sauce but it's available.\n\nWe left after that, and I had a weird craving for it again so we came back a week later.\n\nI ordered the special with chicken katsu and beef teriyaki, amebi, and red dragon roll and my friend ordered the vegetable curry along with the shrimp tempura. \n\nAgain, the sushi is not their strong point. It was fresh amaebi, and the fried head was again wonderful, but the rice, it needs work.\n\nBut the real winner is their fried foods. One of the best chicken katsu I've ever tasted, coupled with tender and juicy beef teriyaki. Simply delicious. I stole a piece of my friend's shrimp tempura and it was wonderful, batter was crispy, not soggy, shrimp is firm and fresh.\n\nTheir strongest suit is their frying technique. I don't know how they do it but it's consistent and it's delicious. If it doesn't taste right, then the chef that usually fries the food is not there.\n\nI don't know what has come before me, a small dinky hole in the wall that is super affordable and all I want is to go back and have their chicken katsu and whatever fried foods they still have.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Harry P."}

However, Lady Fate twisted her knife in my belly last Saturday when the Sundance Kabuki had some technical fiasco and canceled the 3PM showing of \"Zero Dark Thirty\". Bummer. And 2-1/2 hours to burn. While casually strolling among my peeps, I noticed Kui Shin Bo out of the corner of my squinty eye. I took a quick look at the Yelp app to see if I was about to make the second biggest mistake of the day (the first was getting the ticket for the movie).\n\nI entered to find a compact place that doesn't really accommodate solitary diners. No matter since the owner cordially offered me a big table for four since they were only half-full in the middle of the afternoon. Yes, yes, I know they have a $8.50 two-item lunch that judging from other tables, looked like quite a hearty deal. But I was in a mood that only a simmering bowl of ramen noodles could address. So dammit, it better be good here. For $7.99, they offer Raman (sic) Noodles with slices of barbecue pork, fish cake cubes, bean sprouts, onion and a semi-hard-boiled egg (see photo). Not bad, in fact, surprisingly good considering that it's not really a noodle house.\n\nThe noodles were al dente, the pork slices big and plentiful, the Chinese cabbage a nice switch, and the broth quite hearty without being too salty. As a side, if you will, I ordered the $5.99 Chicken Wings, five of them which were nicely grilled and quite succulent (see photo). When I squeezed lemon on them, I immediately flashbacked to my childhood when my mom prepared them the same way - light on the salt, heavy on the citrus.

The rolls were well-packed and portions were huge. We only spent $70 for 4 people and this includes 4 big rolls, 1 sushi burrito, and 2 lunch specials! The lunch specials were a good deal - you pick 2 meal options for the total price of $9.95. If it's a meal that does not have a soup base, it also comes with soup, rice, and veggies! \n\nI have to give two thumbs up for the service. The owners / waitstaff actually walk over to personally advise us on how to eat certain meals. For example, we ordered this dish composed of a fried fish and several sauces. They came up to us and showed us that the best way to eat this meal would be to slather rice over it and pour the sauce on top of that. It definitely tastes a whole lot better than eating the fish by itself.  \n\nFor them to take the time to show us how to correctly eat the meal to get the best out of our dining experience was going above and beyond!

In a raining day as it was... the perfect meal to cozy me up. \n\nI will for sure come back any chance I get!", "author": "Ling G."}

We ordered two bento boxes which was only $9.49 each - you get to choose two options of your choice & it comes with rice, soup & salad. The owner took our order & he recommended the Volcano roll so we ordered that as well. Great customer service!\n\nBento box #1 - was with Takoyaki & beef teriyaki. The Takoyaki (5pcs) was great! It was a good size & was filled with big pieces of octopus which is a plus bc most places that sell these barely have any in them. It also came with a bottle of BBQ sauce just in case you needed more of it! The beef teriyaki was also great, the beef tasted fresh & the teriyaki sauce was bomb! I kept scooping it onto my rice. \n\nBento #2 - was also with Takoyaki & fried shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura (2pcs) was fried to a crisp & was hot when it came out. The miso soup came in a soup bowl with a lid, it was so cute! \n\nVolcano Roll - Honestly, one of the best rolls I've tried! It consists of shrimp tempura, tuna, salmon, snow crab, masago, avocado, cucumber, spicy mayo & kabayaki sauce! The shrimp tempura gave it a nice crunch & it was topped off with real crab meat. Ugh, you have to try it! Definitely coming again!", "author": "Brenda R."}

As ridiculous as this might sound--I was actually craving for the typical curry rice that comes out of the box packages but with fresh veggies and sliced beef which is how the restaurant across the way (Mifune Don) usually serves it up.  However, last time i was at Mifune Don, I got the instant runs (sorry, TMI) after I ate a curry rice plate so I opted to try Kui Shin Bo instead.  So instead of the typical box curry, the fatty beef found in this curry rice comes in chunks that's been stewed for a while so it is indeed tender.  I also asked for it to be mild but it was still very spicy.  \n\nThe wait was not too bad for dinner time on a Saturday night.  The place is small and at 6:30 PM, we waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  \n\nAll in all, I would come back if it is convenient and there's no long wait but I would not go out of my way to eat here especially since they're not one of the establishments that validate parking.", "author": "Ivy Z."}

The lunch special usually comes with miso soup, rice, and salad. Tonkatsu is good but garlic egg noodles were just alright, a little bland. Also if you get the noodles they don't give you rice (I did not know this beforehand so I was a little upset), probably because the noodles were larger portion than the other dishes. My boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki as one of his sides and it was a very small portion. Overall the portion of the dishes were reflective of the price, and the food is just alright.", "author": "Beth H."}

I ordered their daily special bento: veggie tempura and california roll which came with soup, salad and rice. My boyfriend ordered their dragon roll, shrimp tempura and udon. I was sad that they didn't give me my soup and salad UNTIL my food came because I'm used to having my soup's and salad's before I get my food so I could have something to munch on. \n:(\n\nIt was super busy when we were there so our food took awhile but it was worth it at the end.\n\n\nVeggie Tempura: small pieces, but tasted good. \nCali roll: decent size, delicious.\nSoup & Salad: soup was good, I'm not a fan of miso soup in the first place so I gave it to my boyfriend. The salad portion was small, good tasty sauce on top though.\nRice: a little on the dry side.\n\nDragon Roll: LOOKS like a caterpillar roll, tasted delicious, sorta small portion.

But it is not really problem as the food themselves taste like Japanese and I could tell that they use Japanese ingredients and spices where they can.\n\nThe interior decoration is very like local Japanese Tei-Shoku style restaurant with the low ceiling and wooden chair and table. Wall decoration of all Japanese paintings and print makings. Only one of them were slightly like of Chinese but not quite sure, they mix in Japan as well so not really a deal.\n\nthe menu is written in Emglish and (Roma-Ji), with helpful pictures which is also very Japanese that makes easy to order from and comes quite close to the image on the menu.\nTheir rice is softer side, and food taste like really from ghee one of Japanese local Tei-Shoku Restaurants. \nInstead of ordering from lunch menu,\nI had their Fried Oyster with Rice and miso soup, and salad. Also ordered 2 pieces of Sushi (Unagi) although. I could imagine the set would come with enough amount for a female, but I just wanted to try their sushi.\n\n Usually Tei-Shoku style restaurants do not serve sushi but why not it is California but Japan. The rice is soft ( using same rice from other menu) and slightly Marinated with Japanese vinegar, but not very distinct. The Unagi itself was good. ($3.5 for 2pc)\nThe waitress might not be very careful conscious with all tables but is very gentle and nice if customers ask any help, like is you need towel or paper to wipe hands, or if you would like water or tea or check.\n\nThe restaurant overall has relaxed atmosphere and I really enjoyed the meal there.

The miso soup was tasty and may have been the highlight of my whole meal. \n\nMy dining partner had the Spicy Beef Yaki Udon. The beef cuts were fatty and almost inedible. The noodles were oddly flavored. Dining partner kept eating out of determination and to not make me feel bad about my Yelp dining choice.\n\nThe prices are VERY reasonable. Our whole bill was around $30. However, it wasn't worth it. I'd rather pay a little more and have food that I enjoy or pay less and eat in.

Unfortunately, we won't be returning to find out.\n\nPS - As I was finishing my review, my dining partner had to go throw up (this was about 90 minutes after the meal).

We were In busy Japan town on Friday evening and were desperate for sushi . The place had good rating so we went for it. My worries started as soon as we sat and start looking at their menu. The listed pricing was pretty cheap with very limited raw fish choices. And of course when the food arrived I realized we got what we've paid for. Pretty awful thin slices of sashimi that you can taste and feel it was recently pulled from a freezer.  My kids beef teriyaki tasted like the meet was cooked in microwave. Nothing really was any good down to their tea which tasted like it was brewed in unwashed coffee pot. The service was not much better either - amongst other poor services like; no refill of tea and water, never pick up used empty dishes, no extra cheap paper napkins and never once checking to see if the customer is doing ok, they had forgotten some of our dishes. We gladly canceled them. Moreover, the sushi chefs were eating behind the bar while slicing and rowing sushi and the place has low score from public health department. I'm really taken back by the rating this place has with poor quality food and services. \nWe ended up eating crepes on the other side of Japan center which is delightfully edible. \nIf you are bargain hunting for sushi and don't mine poor quality sushi and services then this is your place but please don't give 4 stars just because it was cheap", "author": "Billy W."}

In the mood for udon and ramen which you can get a number of restaurants in Japantown Mall.  Kui Shin Bo is right next to the store and was advertising a 2 item $8.50 dinner.  Since udon or ramen alone is usually about that, we decided to try it.\n\nPlace was pretty empty, in contrast to the restaurants in West Mall, which were pretty full (we walked over after dinner).  All 4 of us ordered some combination of udon/ramen.  2 of us had chicken teri, 1 tonkatsu, 1 oysters.   We devoured the udon and ramen.  Noodles were nice and light, broth not too salty and each included some veggie (if you count seaweed as a veggie).  Our dinners weren't supposed to come with rice, but when we asked they gave us some.\n\nPortions were fine, we ate it all but left full.  Not the best quality Japanese food we've had, but a great value for a Saturday night dinner.", "author": "Steve G."}

The squid was rubbery and badly grilled with a hint of teriyaki.  I asked for more to mask the taste.  Next came our unagi and white tuna.  The sushi rice was sweet and moist, the unagi was pretty standard but the white tuna was sub par...not buttery and fatty like it should be.  We shared a dragon roll and sent it back because I requested no avocado.  Thank goodness I did because the avocado had already turned brown.  Lastly we indulged in the ramen.  This was the only saving grace.  The black garlic was aromatic and earthy and aided in a savory broth.  The pork was done nicely with bean sprouts and basil for a good flavor and texture balance.  We got spicy B and it was every bit of it.  Very dissapointing if expecting a higher taste quality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-06", "description": "I have tried some of  the other restaurants in Japantown, but from my own personal experience, Kui Shin Bo is the best for its price point and good food. For $8.50 you get your pick of a variety of menu items such as curry with rice, tempura, agedashi tofu, teriyaki, udon, ramen, katsu, and much more! The portions are very generous for a restaurant located in San Francisco and directly inside the Japantown mall. \n\nI typically order the curry with rice and veggie tempura. If you don't order any of the soups (udon, ramen, etc) you also get miso soup and salad. Their tempura is the best I ever had. The batter is just right and it isn't ridiculously greasy like other places. You can still see the vegetable but still have a bit of a crunch to bite into when you eat the tempura. The curry is delicious too. It definitely does not taste like pre-packaged curry you get at the store. The meal all together is very wholesome and adequately filling (you won't want to get full anyway - you gotta try some desserts in other parts of Japantown while you're there ;) ). Their agedashi tofu is really good, too. If you get a combination like ramen and curry rice as your two items, it's like having two separate meals in one sitting! It's great! \n\nThere's a man who is always there when I visit. He is a nice man with a thick Japanese accent. He is very kind and attentive. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very cute. It feels a little bit like a legit restaurant in Japan and has really cute little seats and tables. \n\nOverall, I really think this restaurant is great. It is not over the top and is a modest little restaurant that deserves more customers. I would hate to see this place go. I'm a little saddened by some reviews saying that they did not like their food or experience at Kui Shin Bo, but I guess everyone has their own personal preference. I think it is worth giving it a shot. It's located in the other mall with Daiso and Ichiban Kan - so if you're looking to mellow out and get away from the busier side of Japantown, come to Kui Shin Bo to give them a try and see for yourself.", "author": "Elle L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-28", "description": "This restaurant is next to the Ichiban Kan general dollar store in Japantown's Plaza Mall, and is trying to find an identity and patronage. \n\nWe came here because we had a 7pm appointment in 45 minutes, so we wanted something quick and cheap. Kui Shin Bo fit the bill for those, as they have a \"Any 2 items for $8.50\" white board dinner special. There is a large choice for the two items, from Sanma Shioyaki to Unagi Donburi, to the more common and the usuals like teriyaki, tempura, California rolls, etc. \n\nIt was 6:00pm on a Saturday night after Thanksgiving, and we were the only two people there for 45 minutes. Maybe everyone was shopping at Macy's downtown, or at Toys R Us or Best Buy, as the J-Town mall wasn't particularly busy on that end either. \n\nThe staff is definitely not Japanese. I couldn't tell if it was Cantonese or something similar I heard form the kitchen. \n\nThe food was OK, actually a good amount for the price, with rice, a small salad, miso soup and the 2 items you selected. I had Saba Shioyaki and Tempura, the Fave Relative had beef teriyaki and California roll. She liked hers (her palate is still developing), but mine was at best OK. The Tempura batter wasn't very light and crisp, and the Saba likewise didn't have that crispiness you seek in a good Mackerel grill. But for $8.50, how can you complain?\n\nI didn't open the menu to see if they still have Burmese and Indian dishes as some of my Yelp friends have mentioned since ownership changed a year or two ago. There were none of those on the 2 items white board. The sushi bar freezer case was empty, so looks like they have given up on that part of their business, focusing on less perishable kitchen dishes. \n\nI don't know how they are going to stay alive with $8.50 dinners from 2 people/hour on a Saturday night. Maybe they do a better lunch business from the bargain hunters coming out of Ichiban Kan. \n\nLike I said, it fit the bill for quick and cheap.", "author": "Wanugee N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-05-08", "description": "Wow, I hesitated to try this restaurant in J-Town next to Ichiban-kan because of their lit sign that reads \"Fine Japanese Cuisine serving Teriyaki, Sukiyaki, Tempura, and Udon.\"  I think the sign serves as negative marketing, especially for someone like myself who hunts for good authentic Japanese restaurants.  I finally decided to try it after reading some positive reviews from Yelpers.    \n\nThe first good sign was the list of specials (see attached picture) hand-written by a Japanese person.  As I entered, I became worried because there was no other customers at 1pm on Sunday afternoon.  But after we were seated, many other customers started to pour in.  \n\nInterior of the restaurant (see pic) was much nicer than the negative marketing sign outside.  Well, get's get to the important part - food!  They served really nice authentic Japanese comfort foods, like Katsudon (fried pork cuttlet rice bowl) which was done really nicely with eggs kept juicy and the right amount of soy sauce flavoring.  Their halibut kama lunch special was also excellent.  I felt that miso soup was sweeter than what I prefer, but each person has their own likings.\n\nThe elderly Japanese waitress was in a really bad mood.  She looked like she did not want to be there.  I'm sure she wasn't feeling great on a Sunday near ending of lunch hour, but her attitude was quite depressing.  Perhaps I caught her on a bad day, but still, I cannot give 5 stars for such service.\n\nI went back this time for dinner.  Again, I found this place to offer solid meal at reasonable price ($28 for two after tip&tax), but for me, this is more of a lunch place.  I highly recommend that you stick to 4-5 specials on the board.  In fact, don't even open the menu, because chef is communicating to you through the board that you will be treated to freshest ingredients if you order their daily special.  The special of the day, curry-don and grilled pork-ginger combination was quite filling.  Curry was so-so, but pork dish was very nice.  Their fried oyster dinner was not bad, but nothing special.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

We went in as we were lured by the menu that was out in the open. We were seated fairly quickly since there weren't many customers yet. The waiter, which I'm guessing is the owner (?), gave us the menu and delivered a more descriptive selection by speech. He was kind and got things done at a swift pace so we left a hearty tip. \n\nThe food was definitely something. I don't know if it's because I was starving but the food tasted extra special. In my friend's word, it tasted homemade; it's as if your parents-were-cooking-you-that-meal sort of thing I guess. I got the udon with tempura all for $8.50. The broth for the udon was tasty and didn't taste like the other Japanese restaurants. Two of my friends who ordered the udon agreed that the broth was something different - in a good way of course. The tempura was lightly battered and the sauce that accommodated the dish was \"light\" and not too thick as I had in other places. I ate up my delicious meal and left, promising to return whenever I'm in Japantown again. \n\nOh, and they have takoyaki, which was a surprise! :)", "author": "Emily M."}

Okay I wasn't fan of my Hamachi Steaks only because I could tell they were bought as frozen little filets and they were dry (decent texture near the skin where there was a little fat) but edible when I mixed the grated daikon (radish) with a little soy sauce and squeezed some fresh lemon juice (just made ponzu or citrus soy) and the tatsuage was ok although it lacked flavor...  maybe some fresh grated ginger and some grated garilc in the marinade would kick things up a bit (but then again it might come premade and frozen).  The Sanma wasn't very fishy which was nice and my friend ate it all up and the spicy tuna roll looked pretty to the eye but I saw them make it and the tuna came from a plastic bag which I've never seen before.  The miso soup was similar to most restaurants... simple with a piece of tofu and a couple slices of scallions and the salad was good but I only got a pinch (like 5 small pieces of lettuce)... it's cool I ate my friend's.  The rice was the highlight for me, super soft and moist and cooked near perfection which caught me off guard.\n\nIf you don't know much about Japanese food then you will love this place, if you know a little to a mediocre amount I wouldn't go unless everyone else around you was closed.

The mackerel is cooked to perfection, with a perfectly charred flavor that is served with daikon and a lemon slice on the side to complement the smoked taste. The tempura is beautifully crispy on the outside, but nice and fluffy on the inside. Both the shrimp and vegetable tempura are served fresh, as if they were just picked out of the garden or fished out of the sea. The gyoza, in my opinion, is their best work of art. Just one bite will bring an umami sensation to all your taste buds. Don't just take my word for it! Try it out for yourself!\nThe customer service here is impeccable. Each member here treats customers like family and gives you an \"at home\" feeling. They are very knowledgable about what they serve and will gladly recommend to you what specials there are that day. \nAdditionally, the pricing here is great, considering the quality of the food.

The chairs were on the smaller side (which was great for me being all of 5'1, not so great for the bf who had to suffer the whole time we were here teeheehee).  We were handed our menu's and told about their daily specials which were written on a white board at the front of the restaurant. With the speical, you get to choose two from the board and it comes with salad, rice and miso soup.  \nOur waiter never came by to bother us with the old \"are you ready to order\". Instead he waited for us to look up and then he came over. In the beginning i wanted the teriyaki chicken and vegetable tempura entree. The waiter convinced me it would be alot cheaper to just order from the daily special menu which had both items that i wanted. Okay, so i gave in and ordered from the white board. The reason why i didnt order from the board the first time was because i didnt know how much it was since the price was not listed. Turned out after we got our bill that indeed it was much cheaper and you got alot more food in the long run for $8.95!!!\n\nWhile waiting for our food to be served, i noticed just how quite this little place was. Sure, there were about 6 tables being occupied by various people but they all talked with a normal non loud tone which was nice to finally be able to hear and have a decent conversation. Well not saying i could never hear when i was at other places, but its nice not to have to raise your voice.Totally felt relaxed and kind of zen as well. \n\nThe waiter brough out my meal first, served on a pretty tray there was a small plate of teriyaki chicken-(large cuts of chicken with teriyaki sauce and sesame seeds sprinkled on top), medium size plate of veggie tempura(-sweet potato,zucchini,carrot,broccoli), a small cup of miso soup-(small cubes of soft tofu, green onions),rice, and a garden salad with dressing.\n\nThe waiter came around often to make sure everything was okay and to refill our water glasses. \n\nJust the right amount of food, perfect in its simplicity!!", "author": "Sarah A."}

We ordered from the specials menu, the regular menu, and from the sushi chart. \n\nThe specials menu for the day were actually complete meals which we didn't know til the food arrived, but it worked out great. It was a grilled halibut, noodle soup, rice ball and pumpkin tempura. The pumpkin was phenomenal and wasn't overloaded with tempura. Just lightly battered. \n\nFrom the regular menu we ordered yellow tail sashimi. It. Was. Like. Butter. Some of the freshest fish I've had in a bit. Our only complaint is that you couldn't break up your order of sashimi into groupings of two. Full orders consisting of 6 or more pieces only. \n\nFinally from the sushi chart we ordered tamago and unagi. Both were spot on. The tamago especially. Instead of being place on a bed of rice like most nigiri, the tamago was big enough to have a pocket in the center where they placed a small ball of rice. Cool presentation. \n\nI hate to round out the review with a negative but I'm gonna anyways. Hot sake only. They need some chilled sake on the menu. There is nothing worse then when your mouth is on fire and you have to drink hot liquids. I guess it was a good thing I had a nice chilled bottle of Sapporo on the table also. Quit judging me.

Their dinner specials (located on the white board at the entrance) were especially appealing.  Wasn't sure what to expect from the waitress as previous reviewers say she's hit or miss.  That nite, she appeared to be normal.  I ordered the Halibut-kama which came with fried oysters, Japanese string beans, rice and miso soup.  T had the soba tempura.  I had thought about ordering sashimi, but figured I wouldn't overdo it.  I was sad to hear they didn't have a lot of variety in their fish selection.  Never been to a place that didn't have hamachi.  I settled for a sake (salmon) nigiri to start off the meal.\n\nWhen our food arrived, we were surprised at the portions.  Very good.  I could've split my meal, if push came to shove.  The fish was nice and flaky and the oysters were still creamy.  T's soba was good, but the broth got to be a little overly salty.  The tempura selection was also very good and varied.\n\nThe topper of the evening was when this party of 4 enters the restaurant.  Sits down.  Has some tea while looking at the menu.  One of them asks the waitress, \"do you have any rolls?  Anything like a caterpillar roll?\"\n\nWaitress says \"no.\"\n\nThe woman goes on to explain to the waitress that it's her friend's birthday and such.\n\nThe waitress responds \"sorry, no JIVE ASS ROLLS here.\"\n\nThe party quickly exits.

The nigiri rice is the perfect consistency and flavor, and the slices of fish are of good size and (from what little I know) cut expertly.\nPrices are also most excellent - an average of only $3.50 for most nigiri.\nKnow that the selection is fairly small, however, and this is an authentic place - don't expect a big selection of creative rolls.  (ie, if you're looking for dragon rolls or rainbow rolls or something, go elsewhere.)\n\nI'll also say we had no problem with bad service at all, unlike many other reviewers.  The chef is very attentive and friendly, and our tea was kept full.  In fact, after ordering some tasty and tender taco (octopus), he taught me how to tell the difference between male and female octopi - in females, the suckers are all the same size; in males they vary in size - and that the females are tastier.  He was serving female, of course. :)\n\nSo great food, and great prices, in a very authentic Japanese atmosphere.  I'll be back!", "author": "Don H."}

If you're in the service industry, her attitude is far from acceptable.  She doesn't even smile, and us always so grumpy.  That's so bad because the restaurant would be popular because of its fine dishes, but I'm sure lots of customers would feel the same way I did.  \n\nYou don't go to a restaurant just to eat.  If the environment of a restaurant isn't good, you don't feel comfortable.  You'd lose your appetite.  I DID lose my appetite when I asked her to bring a glass of water a few times.  I asked her very nicely but she was very rude and took her almost 30 minutes to bring a water. \n\nIf you don't care about the environment and just look for good food, you might like it.  That's my opinion.\n\nAgain, to me, even though the food is good, I can't enjoy the flavor of the dishes when a food server isn't nice.", "author": "Mike M."}

There were 4 tables (out of something like 12) on a very slow Sunday. We got our food in an HOUR. \n\nTo top it off, the server gave us a dirty look when we started asking when the food's going to come.  She either has a very short term memory loss or must've smoked weed cuz we had to ask 3 times to get chopsticks and 5-6 times for water. I'm no restaurant guru, but i think having basic utensils might make the sales process go a bit smoother.\n\nThe sushi-man (well, actually it was a woman) took 20 minutes for 2 orders of sushi... then another 20 minutes for another order. She must've gotten out of the building to go catch a fish, prepare it, and drive back in all that time... I dunno how long it takes to prepare one freakin' order of California rolls. (i.e. rice, crab meat, avocado, and laver).\n\nIN their defense, the sushi lady gave us a \"freebie\" b/c i guess she could tell we were getting frustrated with the slow service. She said \"no charge\" when she gave us an order of sushi. I couldn't tell if SOME of the stuff on the order was free or the entire thing was free. I asked her for explnation but she spoke limited english. Despite the fact that she could've asked her manager for interpretation, she decided to answer \"no charge, no charge\" no matter how many times I asked for clarification.\n\nWhat's more interesting is how the cook came out to eat his lunch when we, the customers, weren't even fed. To top it off, the head waitress/manager stared at us for last 5 minutes we were there while eating her food.\n\nFood was ok. Price was good.\nService sucked ass.", "author": "TaeWoo K."}

I mean, like, fish just caught, grilled, fried, raw, etc... with just a little salt or dipping sauce. All manner of reef fish, fresh tuna, mahi mahi, parrot fish... you name it.\n\nHaving eaten enough delicious fish & rice, during my visit, to last me a few years, my palate has re-asserted itself to delicate seafood/fish flavors. That said, Kuishinbo's saba is amazingly good! A whole side of mackerel, grilled to perfection, and dressed with the lightest squeeze of lemon. My Lord it was a good homecoming meal. Add to the fact my totally non-seafood eating friend asked to try a bite, is reason enough to get thee ass to this place.\n\nKuishinbo has a good selection of donburi (rice bowl) dishes, and everyday-type Japanese fare. The specials were good, serving sizes were hearty, and our server was charming & casual. One of my friends wanted uni nigiri, but the server advised against it. I like that honesty.\n\nI've never paid much attention to this tucked away restaurant, because I really dislike the lighting/atmosphere inside Peace Plaza. It seemed like it could be a tourist trap, but my perception was wrong. I would not have eaten here if it wasn't recommended.

The entrees include beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, tonkatsu, saba ship, shrimp tempura, etc...  It's not gourmet but it's homestyle.  I'm not Japanese so I am not going to make any claims about if it's like my Osaka mama's cooking but it's better than your typical J-town shop.  If you aren't hardcore Japanese, you won't complain either.  You can go to McDonald's and pay the same amount.  The owners are friendly and never up sell you.

We noticed several groups of Japanese people inside eating, so we figured the food couldn't be too bad and $7.50 for lunch is a steal. \n\nMy boyfriend had chicken katsu and ramen and I had chicken katsu and shrimp tempura. My boyfriend has been fighting a cold for several days now and he said the warmth of the ramen helped his sinuses out, and furthermore it tasted pretty good!

((2-5pm everyday)).\nThey also no longer close between Lunch and Dinner so they are open Tuesday thru Sunday  11:30am- 9pm!\nStill, if you would like to taste what people have in Japan the Special Board is extremely helpful ( not the same usual fare of the genre). If you really look closely at the menu you may notice that there are also some things that you do not find very often though you can still get the usual japanese american offerings if that is what you are seeking.\nI am very happy that this place is back on track- I am sure it will once again be a favorite!!!!", "author": "RojiFox Q."}

Has very good sushi, but I'm usually going for the other dishes like grilled mackerel or beef donburi or fried oysters.  Has a good range of everyday Japanese fare.", "author": "John T."}

Amazing price for the special - only $7.50 and had wonderful calamari & tonkatsu which came with rice, miso & \"salad\".  Waiter was very nice & attentive, apologized for the wait because they only had one chef & we were there with a VERY large group.  Tasted my kid's ramen & it was also the best I'd tasted.  We will definitely go back, that is for sure!", "author": "P F."}
