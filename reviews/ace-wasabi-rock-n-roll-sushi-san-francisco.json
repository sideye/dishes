Then, an hour into our wait they showed us to a table of four that had only three seats. This table was next to an empty table of 10+, and they wouldn't take a seat from it. Wow. The hostess just couldn't figure out that the right thing to do is give us the seat.

Get the truffle edamame (and dip everything in the leftover sauce). We really loved the tuna Tataki, the crab handroll, and the Jagger roll. The hamachi lime roll was the ideal hit of freshness too, balancing out the richer roll. \n\nThe sake infused margarita had great flavour and wasn't too sake-y. Served with a cute bamboo straw!

I came on a Saturday around 5:15pm and saw that it opened at 5:30p so my girlfriend and I walked around the nearby stores to wait til it opened. Once we got to Ace at 5:35p, the restaurant was almost full! Come a bit earlier to grab a seat for Happy Hour! We ordered the 21 piece sashimi ($21), tater tots($6), albacore avocado roll ($6), and crispy salmon roll ($6) off the happy hour menu. The sashimi is as fresh as it could get, some pieces literally melted in your mouth and they were nice and fatty pieces too. The tater tots was really good as it is different than your traditional tater tot, they make it from mashed potato. My favorite roll off the happy hour menu was the albacore avocado roll. That roll had fresh albacore that had a slight hint of spice which made the roll great. The crispy salmon,on the other hand, wasn't my favorite. For me, this restaurant is great since it has the happy hour menu (which i'll be coming back for), but the other items were slightly overpriced for me.\nThere is bingo Mon-Sat at 6:30pm which is a nice interaction which the guest, but only one game is played per day.

I've also never shown up 3 minutes after a restaurant opened to discover that almost half of the seating area was already full. Ace Wasabi seems to be quite loved in the area.\n\nAce Wasabi is basically one of those fusion party sushi joints -- lots of experimenting with classics, plus there's a \"bar bar\" in addition to a sushi bar. We showed up for Happy Hour, which is 5:30pm-6:30pm on Saturdays. There was a line spilling out of the door to sit down, but we managed to snag a table in the back area. Happy Hour patrons get to play a round of Bingo at 6:30pm, too. Winner gets a $20 gift card for next time, or a hat. We didn't win, but we were so close!\n\nHere's what we got:\n\n- Seasonal Sashimi: 20 pieces for $21, only one order per table. Comes with salmon, albacore, yellowtail, tuna, seabass and butterfish. The fish were fresh and delicious. Butterfish isn't common in my parts, and I savored it. Good for two to share.\n\n- Sake Kirota Roll: 5 thick pieces for $15. Salmon, crab, tobiko (black fish roe), avocado and ginger all wrapped in daikon (white radish). No rice, comes drizzled in ponzu sauce. I've never had a roll wrapped in daikon -- not bad. I liked this roll.  \n\n- Sake Avocado Roll: $6 for 6 pieces. Your average salmon and avocado cut roll, with sesame seeds on the outside.\n\nService was decent, though our server seemed a bit forgetful. She was sweet, but one of our rolls was missing and we had to remind her about it. The tables on either side of us were missing dishes, too.\n\nBe warned -- they play loud rap and R&B, not rock-n-roll. There's also a .025% \"SF Mandates\" surcharge added to the bill.", "author": "Kathy Z."}

Otherwise, you're going to have to arrive as walk-ins. We lucked out and snagged seats at the bar. The guys at the sushi bar were so nice and offered us some dishes on the house :)\n\nI'm not sure if it's because it's HH, but the pieces were on the smaller side.

Think people who have gotten way too drunk and started dancing in the dining room. I mean, I know it's a clubby kind of sushiya, but I was so uncomfortable through that entire dinner. We came aware that there was a bar aspect to Ace Wasabi, but there was no rock-n-roll -- mostly R&B and rap.\n\nWe split three rolls: the sake kirota, shinjuku, and Victoria's Secret. Additionally, we ordered a small plate/appetizer of Japanese croquettes. Because I wasn't driving, I also got the hard cider on their menu, which was crisp, clear, and refreshing.\n\nSushi here is excellent; I think they have inventive rolls that are less commonly seen on other American sushi menus. Everything tasted fresh, and I was surprised by how tasty some rolls featuring ingredients I typically don't touch were. Props to the sushi chefs for that.\n\nOne of the disappointing things that happened that night was that the croquettes, which we intended to be our appetizer, were entirely forgotten about until they had almost brought the check to us. We had to ask for them, and by that point, I almost wanted to leave it off the check because I wanted to get out of there.\n\nI wouldn't come back.

The hostess was nice and thanked us for being patient with waiting, the waitress was pleasant and attentive checking in on us several times throughout our meal.\n\nFood: 3 stars - while I can't say the food was terrible I also can't say the food was really. Overall it was just ok.  For the price point that we spent ($120 without alcohol) I would expected a little bit better quality of dining. We had several appetizers, one that stood out to me was the shishito peppers. While the app tasted good but the portion was incredibly small for the 13 dollar price point. \n\nDecor/ambiance: 3 stars - Music playing in the background offered a good vibe, the pictures on the wall were fitting for the establishment and while the people at the neighboring table that were chanting and yelling after every sake bomb they took were rather loud we still managed to enjoy a low key meal.\n\nOverall while I can't say I can't wait to go back to Ace I also can't say I would never come there again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-16", "description": "My wife and I are on a never-ending quest for perfect bites of sushi. A night of good sushi is a wonderful night already, but sushi plus the thrill of free bingo enters another level of excitement. All prices below are happy hour prices.\n\n\nWe arrived right when happy hour started. It was mid-week so it didn't fill up instantly, but it was bustling loudly about an half hour into it. I try to order a reflection of how the restaurant presents itself. Ace Wasabi presents itself as a fusion sushi establishment that still know what good quality sashimi is. Challenge accepted.\n\n\nSeasonal sashimi sampler: Half price during happy hour, 20 pieces for $21. They didn't go over-the-top trying to impress us with rare and odd cuts of fish, but everything they presented was done well. Every slice was cut appropriately in reference to grain direction and minimizing excessive connective tissue/stringy sensation. Their variations of cuts of hamachi, ahi, and salmon were professionally done and worth much more than the happy hour price. A smooth start to the meal.\n\n\nJapanese Tonkatsu \"Tater Tots\": $5 I love taking the chance to try fusion foods. These little morsels of mashed potatoes with tonkatsu-style breading and frying were a display of how Ace Wasabi knows how to have balanced fun. Perfect ratio of breading to mashed potato, consistent texture and color, along with a sweet-spicy sauce to round out the experience. Bravo to them for knowing how to show restraint and subtlety in a fried dish.\n\n\nBori Bori Tuna (crispy rice with spicy tuna): $12 Nothing to make a huge deal about, but plentiful with the tuna, warm and crispy rice base, and a unique style of a chunkier spicy tuna make this worth at least one try.\n\n\nCrunchy Spicy Tuna Roll: $6 A favorite happy hour selection among many reviews. Excellent ratio of rice to filling and fresh cucumber and lettuce make this a refreshing roll. I also want to give some praise to the nice snap and aroma of the seaweed outside that made for a high-quality roll.\n\n\nGiant (charred) Calamari: $11 Just like it sounds, a big ol' slab of squid fresh off the grill. I love grill/char flavor and I like some fresh calamari. If you like those things, definitely worth a try.\n\n\nBack in Black Roll: $17 Legitimately one of my favorite sushi rolls in all of California. It had a rich and full seafood taste. The real crab with the smooth scallop gave just enough texture to appreciate the combination. Melt-in-your-mouth salmon on top with strikingly shiny black tobiko. And they didn't over sauce it! Every bite hits several senses at once and makes you appreciate the thought they put into their rolls.\n\n\nAnd of course BINGO! At the end of happy hour (630), everyone gets a free bingo card with a chance to win a gift certificate to the restaurant. I didn't win, but appreciated how organized the whole concept was and it was a blast for those couple of minute. A necessary part of our first experience.\n\n\nThe last thing I'll say it sit at the sushi bar if this is your first time. All of the sushi chefs were professional, personable, and willing to answer any questions about the menu. They accommodate well to special requests, and know how to time your food for a relaxed but not overly slowed experience.\n\n\nAlright Ace Wasabi, here's your 5 stars.

While sitting at a table would have been more intimate, there are very few tables and they're usually accommodating larger parties and can get pretty squished. Choosing the sushi bar was a perfect choice also because we had front row seats to the sushi chefs and the kitchen grill. \n\nMy favorite dish was from the grill; the short ribs were amazing! Appropriately greasy, flavorful, and not too fatty with tons of really thin cut meat on every bone. The serving size was surprisingly big considering it was a small plate. \n\nI particularly appreciated my experience because the sushi chef we had was really nice. He was super attentive and was always checking in on us. He even treated me and the duo sitting next to us to a complimentary roll. It was fun to watch him cut the sashimi and carefully craft the plates. \n\nAlso, considering the price of Japanese food in SF, I was really pleasantly surprised when we didn't rack up a ridiculous bill. Would definitely come again!", "author": "Kathy T."}

Yea not gonna happen!), but the subsequent few times I called they said that wasn't an issue anymore.\n\nWe were seated in the back room which looked to also be a few other birthday parties. The atmosphere back there is super fun - sake bombs, music, & pretty loud. The sushi selection was actually pretty diverse, which I enjoyed. We got edamame (spicy & non spicy), and fried chicken to share. I got the hokkaido role, which was actually very tasty! I didn't expect this type of party-sushi-restaurant to also have really great sushi, but the rolls that I tried and ordered were pretty damn good.\n\nThey sang happy birthday to me with a little candle in an ice cream mochi, which I thought was a cute touch.

Basically, one last night of drinking and having fun before he became a baby daddy. I believe someone made a reservation for 8 people at Ace Wasabi's Rock 'n' Roll Sushi on Friday, August 2nd at 8pm.\n\n*Hamachi lime roll: yellowtail, jalapeno, lime, cilantro, tobiko ($8) \u00d73\n*Crunchy sake roll: crispy potato bits rolled w/soy bean paper, salmon, thin slices of lemon ($14) \u00d73\n*Marley's mango lobster roll: maine lobster, mango, cilantro, macadamia nuts w/spicy aioli ($14) \u00d73\n*Spider roll: crispy soft shell crab, avocado, lettuce ($11)\n*Lobster gyoza potstickers: maine lobster, scallions ($14)\n*Blistered shishito peppers: lemon, sea salt ($6) \u00d72\n*Hamachi kama: grilled yellowtail collar w/ponzu ($12)\n*Uni: sea urchin, mendocino ($10 nigiri) \u00d72\n*Mixed sashimi: 20 slices of today's fresh fish selected by the chef ($42) \u00d72\n\nI didn't eat much of the food except for the shishito peppers, uni nigiri, and the mixed sashimi. I love shishito peppers, but they were super under salted. A little disappointing. The uni nigiri was okay. Sweet, creamy, and they piled the uni on top. After we got the uni though, we realized we should have added a quail egg to give it that extra richness. I didn't really like the sushi rice in the nigiri. It was a little mushy. I'm not exactly sure what was in the sashimi plate, but I tried one of each kind. We got four slices each of five different varieties of fish. They were all pretty fresh. I know we got hamachi, sake, and maguro. Not sure what the other two were.\n\nOf course, we had to drink! They boys wanted nigori, so we stuck to the Sayuri (300 ml): floral and creamy ($15) \u00d77 and Sapporo: 21 oz ($10) \u00d74. Make sure to shake each bottle of nigori as it got thicker and thicker, the more we got into the bottle. I'm not a huge fan of this sake as I prefer crisp, dry sakes, but it was easy to drink.\n\nI loved the music here. They were playing 90s hip hop and r&b, which I adore. The music is bumping and the atmosphere is boisterous, so this is definitely not a place for a quiet intimate date. But for a fun night of drinking and eating, Ace will definitely do. Saw a bunch of people doing sake bombs around us.\n\nFun place with average sushi. Rounding up to four stars because of the great music!", "author": "Elena N."}

My coworker and I decided we wanted sushi and heard really good things about this place. We arrived shortly after they opened and it was already packed. We put our names in and was told it would be about a 20 minute wait. We told the hostess we were gonna go over to the bar. About forty minutes later we were still waiting so I proceeded to check on what was taking so long. The hostess said that because we went to the bar she didn't think we wanted a table anymore. I was like why would you assume that without asking. She then tried seating us at the sushi bar which was so crowded you couldn't move.  I told her we wanted an actual table. She eventually got us in a table in the back with the rowdiest group of college students who were singing on the top of their lungs. I'll be honest, I had a long day at work and really was just annoyed at this point. The only saving grace was how good the sushi was.

Not to mention, i've never had to wait more than 40 minutes for food to be delivered to our table, especially when it's raw, uncooked sashimi served on rice?\n\nNot sure why this place has great ratings, but if you want to spend a lot and get nothing special then check it out.", "author": "Zaher A."}

Not cheap as 3 items (tempura and 2 rolls) totaled $45. Food was good but nothing to die for. The tempura batter was thick not the panko that would make it lighter and more tasty. The 2 rolls were of good size and had good taste. The fish was fresh which made the rolls worthwhile. The water that was served was refreshing and worth drinking more than a standard drink.

My party of three were welcomed by such a sweet hostess and our waitress, Makayla was awesome! She sat us at the sushi bar and we had such a unique experience. We ordered 5 sushi rolls for the three of us and chili edamame (SO GOOD). In between our sushi rolls--compliments of our fantastic chef Sam- we were given grilled fish ribs which were so tender and tasty. And then when we thought we were done, we received poke tostadas which were so fresh with mango and topped with sesame seeds. Would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.\n\n10/10 would go back.

Which I guess makes sense since they have Roll in their name.\n\nThird, they take the \"Rock\" in their name just as seriously.  Not only are their unique posters of rock stars and music legends with pieces of sushi photoshopped in, but they're also blasting music the entire time and give a very clubby atmosphere. \n\nLike I said, good if you're in the mood for it, not if you're expecting a more traditional sushi environment.", "author": "Denis S."}

It wasn't ridiculously expensive either. Pro Tip - If you plan on having a few rolls, start with a protein (the charred octopus is a steal) and in the middle of your meal, get the spicy chili edamame (huge plate of it for cheap). This will keep your total down and limit your rice intake. \n\nFriendly sushi bar service complete with a special end-of-the-meal mini roll that was out of this world. Somehow we got out of there for under $100 and had beer and sake too. Will definitely be back for BINGO Happy Hour next time to save even MORE moolah.

The edamame were perfectly steamed and not overly salty.  The short ribs were mouthwatering good; tender with a lot of flavor.  We ordered the 12- piece mixed sashimi, the Ozzy and the Victoria's Secret Rolls.  The sashimi was great and sliced in perfect portions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-04", "description": "Ace Wasabi. It's got something for everyone. It's a rowdy Bigno-playing happy hour loving American bar in the front, a classy conversation-conducive dining spot in the back room, and a traditional sushi bar in the middle. Diverse decorations all around--a disco ball, images of famous celebrities eating sushi, posters of AC/DC and Guns N' Roses, and a \"Keep Calm and Sake Bomb\" poster just for fun. Smiling staff to match the fun ambiance. I began rooting for this place before my first bite. As my March Madness bracket can attest, just because you root for a team, it doesn't mean they win.\n\nI visited Ace Wasabi for happy hour, between 5:30-6:30 pm and got the $6 dollar sushi rolls--the Spicy Tuna and Eel Rolls. I ordered at about 6:00 pm and didn't get my meal until 6:30 pm,  but I was okay with that; I was having a great time taking in the ambiance and playing bingo. Then the food arrived. I was immediately disappointed--the rolls lacked vibrancy and the overcooked rice barely covered the seaweed underneath. The construction around each piece gave way a bit between my chopsticks. By the time the first piece hit my mouth, it dissolved into an indistinguishable combination of lukewarm flavors, with a chewy seaweed finish. At least the Kiran beer was refreshing and did the job washing it all away.\n\nAce Wasabi. It's got something for everyone...unfortunately, good sushi isn't one of those things.", "author": "Behnam S."}

We walk-in and it was the normal Marina young-Anglo-yuppie crowd and felt a bit out-of-place with such a large party with 3 kids under 8.  But as soon as we walked-in the server was ALL SMILES and they immediately situated us, for our own sanity, in the back, out of the way of the dim sushi bar room that had a very fun party bar social energy to it.  As we walked back to our table, the other employees greeted us with welcoming energy greetings.  My entire clan was able to catch their nightly bingo game - the kids LOVED it. We ordered their avocado cucumber rolls and they were amazing.  And since we hit bingo happy hour, we got a special deal on their Garden Roll (Crispy asparagus with garlic eggplant, avocado and scallion.)  I appreciate how they are willing to accommodate vegans.  They had some other cucumber vegan roll.  Not bad for a sushi place - at least they are aware of our growing population.  (My nephew who is not a vegan loved the place too!)", "author": "Khash C."}

We recently came back to visit Will and the experience was excellent. Some turnover in the kitchen has paved the way for Will to lend some of his creativity to the menu (and items he comes up with off menu). The fish was fresh, expertly cut and prepared to perfection. \n\nSome important tips to remember when dining at Ace: Do whatever you can to sit at the sushi bar - it's an experience that changes the way you view and enjoy the restaurant. The kitchen staff has a great rapport and they will integrate you into their banter if you show an interest. They can take it as well as they dish it out. When possible, sit in front of Will and let him drive. Though he does an excellent job with items both new and old on the menu, if you tell him to get creative or pick what you eat, you'll be taking a freight train to flavor country (don't let him let you get away without trying the baked crab hand roll).

Sometimes I dream about the baked crab hand roll. They only use REAL CRAB people!!! \n\nOther highlights:\nAlbacore toro\nTataki\nFresh Uni w/quail egg\nShibui\nButterfish nachos \nGinger Tofu\nChronic hand roll \nChicken Fingers (*trust me it's like crack)\nSpider roll (*honest to god I've never seen anyone use whole huge perfectly fried soft shell crab in spider rolls aside from here!!!)\n\nAnd it's not just the reasonably priced quality food, or the bingo, or the smoke bombs (delicious crisp cider and a shot of creamy unfiltered nigori), or the excellently curated sake menu (I recommend the Kokumi, Yoshinogawa, Onikoroshi, or denshin yuki.. The Hannya is also a unique spicy plum sake), or the amazing selection of Hitachino Nest beers (drink this over Sapporo and thank me later. it's actually from Japan)  .. But it's the energy of the owner Ken, sushi chefs, staff and patrons that have been coming in for years that make this classic marina gem a neighborhood favorite.\n\nI love this place and a huge piece of my heart will always be there. I've built lasting friendships and memories at this place. The owner has a big heart and truly cares about everyone here. He listens to feedback from staff and patrons and applies it to his business. He's also very accommodating. Whether you want to throw a company party (Google has had one of the marketing teams throw a holiday party in the back), engagement party, bachelorette or shower.. It's all been done with lots of fun!\n\nThe sushi bar is another experience. Tell Chef David or Les that you're reading my review and let them know you heard how awesome they are from me. These guys are hilarious and will show you a good time. Ask Will to make you his rocket man roll and you won't regret it. \n\nOr maybe sit at the sake bar. Get to know some of the regulars and be up front for the weekday Bingo and Happy Hour action! \n\nBottom line: Ace Wasabi's is not just quality sushi but it's an experience for all ages.

There was a variety of items ordered, including miso soup, edamame, various sushi rolls, sashimi, and vegetable tempura (we pretty much ordered the menu).\n\nPros:\n+ The rolls were creative combinations - I got the Crunch Ace Wasabi ($7) which was fresh crab, eel, macadamia nuts, and wasabi tobiko, and the Three Amigos ($10) which was tuna, yellowtail, eel, cucumber, avocado, wasab tobiko w/ soy aioli.  Both were interesting tastes that I hadn't experienced before.\n+ The tempura was cooked well, not overdone\n+ All the fish was fresh and had great individual flavor; all the crab they offer is a nice change of pace from other places\n+ Prices are reasonable for the area of the city and portion size\n\nCons:\n- The sashimi plate took an inordinate amount of time to come out (7 people got their food within 10-15 minutes - the sashimi plate took about 30).  Of course you can't expect all the food (especially sushi) to come out at the same time, but it was getting a little ridiculous as everyone else had nearly finished by then\n- Edamame was cooked alright but really over-sauced\n- Rice/filling ratio was a little high - they do offer a quinoa-based substitute for an extra charge, which I would try next time\n\n\n3.5 stars on the side of 4.", "author": "Ben K."}

Why is it so hard to get a drink? Then like normal people, when your drunk runs out, you would like another.... Well I guess the server was too busy to consider it. I asked again... Then I asked a random busboy... Then we just went to the bar and got drinks on our own. When I brought this up to our server she told me the busboys are in charge of drinks and they're getting ready to close. What the hell kind of response is that? I'm paying the exact same amount as someone coming in 3 hours ago... So if I come in early I'll get better service? \n\nShame on you ace wasabi.

And honestly, wouldn't have come here had my friend not decided on this place for our Saturday night dinner.  But I was definitely pleased with how things turned out.\n\nStarted with the edamame sanpura.  Definitely more of a fan of the garlic butter edamame then the seat salt and chile lime versions, but they're all pretty good.  Can't complain about it as an appetizer.\n\nThe albacore tataki is flat-out amazing.  Even at this very moment, I'm still having a craving for it.  Perfectly seared, fish quality as super fresh, and the garlic ponzu sauce that it was marinated in matched the fish perfectly.  An automatic choice every time.  It would be an absolute travesty if you came here and didn't order this.\n\nAs far as rolls, had the 49er, Tiger, and Dragon.  Although slightly more expensive than I'm used to (I found the motherlode in San Diego), it's definitely worth it because the fish was super fresh and the quality of the rolls was top notch.  Hell, even the rice was made well.\n\nProps on the service, as the waitress was extremely friendly and was very helpful in figuring out how to split a 14 person tab.

My friend got her ($5-happy hr) glass of Rose within minutes and my drink didn't come for...10-15 minutes? My sweet friend walked all the way to the back to the restaurant to ask about my drink and the female waitress said she would get it for us asap. Another 5-10 minutes, nothing :( We finally got her attention again and she just nonchalantly said \" oh sorry I just forgot\"...uhm......ok....\n\nChicken tenders off the happy hr menu - under seasoned, dipping sauce was way too mayo-y to bring out other flavors. Asked for a different spicy sauce. Serrano chili sauce? that was great!\n\nSalmon- $5 highlight of the meal because it was a huge portion of salmon, seasoned alright and hot.\n\nAll the rolls we got were messy *see photos* and sort of a joke. 2/3 rice and 1/3 filling. If I had to pay full price for this I would have sent the rolls back. Not sure if it was because of the happy hr..that the quality was off? I do see high reviews for this place so maybe that was it....\n\nMy friend bet me that our waitress/server wouldn't put the drink on the tab and I told her she totally would because she clearly had no idea that she had forgotten about a drink twice. dun dun dun, she most definitely put it on the tab :( boooo. From other reviews it seems as though the service has gone downhill and waiting a long while for food is not out of the ordinary for this restaurant. \n\n$46 total, which is not horribly expensive, but I would rather pay extra for quality fish, sushi and good service. Make sure to keep your receipts here...handful of reviews have posted about fraud..\n\nThe female server we had was not necessarily rude or unpleasant, but very absent minded and just laughed off everything.

They have two varieties of fresh sea urchin available. Both were extremely clean and fresh tasting. Uni can be hit or miss but it is definitely good to have at Ace's. The uni portions were very generous as well with two pieces of sea urchin on each piece of nigiri. \n\nWe also ordered a couple rolls.

They have an undyed pickled ginger (not the artificial pink stuff with preservatives and too much sugar) and they have authentic fresh grated wasabi.

Fresh wasabi isn't always as spicy as the powdered stuff (where they often add non-wasabi horseradish as a filler) but it is more flavorful. The fresh wasabi has a noticeable grated texture vs the bland uniformness of reconstituted powder and is best if you put a little directly on your sushi or sashimi before consuming (although I won't fault anyone for mixing it in their soy sauce if that's your preference).\n\nWe had several carafes of warm sake to wash down our food and the owners of the restaurant also brought out a round of house shots for my birthday. \n\nAnyhow, I was impressed with dinner here. A lot of very solid items on the menu and wonderful service.", "author": "Adisak P."}

He greeted us kindly and took our order, said his name was Will. Now my husband likes nigiri so he started ordering a bunch, also asking if there were any specials, Will then told him, let me give you the best I have, we went with it, as we weren't on a budget or anything. BEST DECISION EVER!! Will whipped up these delicious rolls for me and treated us with some of the best nigiri we have ever had. He made these incredible rice paper wraps that were the best thing I've ever ate in my life. I would recommend this spot next to Will at the sushi bar  to anyone.

This review is for the sushi bar in the back, specifically with Will. While a sushi snob might be reluctant to enjoy the experience at Ace, you would be judging a book by its cover. I frequently sit down in front of Will and ask for an omakase style nigiri/sashimi meal. Will does not disappoint in fish selection, variety, style, and skill. That's not to say that he doesn't do a great job with your standard-fare American-style rolls (I'm looking at you California/spicy tuna roll orderer, but you do you), but if you're looking for a higher-end omakase experience in an affordable and informal environment, the sushi bar at Ace (and Will!) is a fantastic go-to option.

I even set the timer on my phone to show the waitress how long it took. What were the waitresses doing? Well one was on her phone texting and then taking a call outside. The other was talking to the bartender and drinking (on the job). We could have easily walked out of the restaurant but instead waited for our bill. We informed the waitress of our frustrations to which we got \"I'm sorry about that.\"  Needless to say we will never go back and I highly recommend Saiwalk across the street.

And his name is ALEX (the bartender from heaven).\n\nI have always loved Ace but this experience set a new standard for me thanks to Alex.  He taught me a thing or two about sake.  He has a genuine interest in it.  I ordered a sake bomb, you know the standard well sake with the regular Kirin beer.  Good yes, but then Alex shared with me his recipe for a smoking sake bomb.  It was sweet and full and delicious.  It was so good that I had to sip it and not slam it.  I had two more.  He also made one with plum wine!  Who new beer could be such a wonderful companion.  \n\nWe had the full order of Tuna Tataki of course and the Rainbow Roll and the Victoria Secret.  They were all amazing.  Alex was extremely attentive  even as the bar got full.

Throw some raw fish between white rice, cover in some terrible-for-you, but delicious sauce, and serve it beside ginger and wasabi. So despite the decent sushi, I was not impressed with this restaurant. \n\nI had called that morning and left a message requesting a reservation for six. After a few rounds of phone-tag with the host, we had it set: dinner for 6 at 8:30pm. Imagine my annoyance when our complete party showed up at 8:25pm and was forced to wait 25 minutes to be seated at a table for four. I made a reservation to prevent this exact occurrence! Lame.  \n\nOther than their terrible reservation accountability, the place was pretty...cool. There is a bar that pretends to be full but only serves wine and sake, interesting decor of no-longer-cool bands like Green Day, and a system for separate checks that makes calculus look easy breezy. \n\nWith Umami, Yuzu, and even Asa around the corner, save your reservation for someplace that enables full range of motion.", "author": "Zoey S."}

I must try the Chef's Omakase (for 2)I continuously re-order the same menu items - albacore tataki, gyoza, robata chicken skewers, the usual apps! My favorite rolls are: spicy jalapeno roll, hamachi lime, crunchy Ace Wasabi, 49er, Ozzy, Flying Kamikaze, and Three Amigos. You can also make custom requests, and the sushi chefs are pretty accommodating! My favorite is when they torch the toro and the yellowtail sashimi..... mmm! Great sake selections as well, and of course all the other traditional offerings that sushi restaurants have.\n\nEnergetic and rock-and-roll themed environment so definitely a good place to come with friends, but it is loud music, so keep that in mind if you are planning date night!

Below are a few go-to items that I find myself ordering time and again: \n\n1. Seared Albacore Tataki\n2. Ozzi Roll- crab, avocado and jalapenos\n3. Crunchy Sake- lemon/salmon\n4. Scorpion- mango/avocado\n5. Hamachi Nigiri\n\nThat said, there has been some changes this year that have down-graded them a bit in my eyes.  With the departure of their head server, a steady flow of new faces seem appearing.  Service has diminished with fouled up orders and longer wait times.  \n\nNot sure if their kitchen staff has changed, but food quality has not been the same in recent months.  I'm finding rolls not cut all the way through, chewy seaweed, and Hamachi that is tough and lacking its normal buttery goodness.  \n\nLastly, evidently they are now \"Rock 'n' Roll\" Sushi, adorning their restaurant in  photos and paraphernalia that is reminiscent of some Vegas freak show.  I always raise a suspicious eye when I find restaurants investing too much energy in a concept.  I want a restaurant to sell me high quality product, not try to distract me with some cheesy theme.  Glossy photos of guitars and a bare chested Jim Morrison is not going to compensate for plating inferior food.  Back to the basics people.", "author": "Todd N."}

I just had to leave a 5 star review because I was so blown away by it! We had the Elvis roll, hamachi lime roll, toro nigiri and Albacore tazaki (I think?). And then a desert roll with pineapple, strawberry and avocado. Skeptical? I was too! It was light and delicious and the perfect end to meal. Everything was fresh and like a explosion of flavor. I haven't been able to stop talking about it since last night. \n\nSide note: I'm a huge sushi snob and haven't had good sushi in a very long time...I almost always expect it to be bad or mediocre at best.

We walked in and immediately told them we wanted Sake, Beer, and some Appetizers and inquired as to whether they could still seat us considering the hour.  The woman who greeted us at the door said that we were welcome to sit at the bar, but would need to order immediately since it was just about last call.  We had no problem with this stipulation, sat down, and ordered over $250 in drinks and food.  \n\nOur drinks arrived in a timely manner, no issues there.  About 10 minutes after we sat down, however, the manager came into the sushi bar and started telling all the cooks, \"no mas\" as in don't take any more orders, so they could close down, I would not have had an issue with this except that we had just put in an order and that the manager was speaking spanish to a bunch of very clearly Asian men.  Luckily the cooks didn't listen to the manager and filled our order.  \n\nWe continued to drink and eat for roughly another 10 minutes until the manager came around and said that he would need for us to start wrapping it up so they could close.  I should note at this point that we were one of three parties still in the restaurant, were not disturbing anyone, and had just ordered a considerable amount of drinks plus food.  \n\nAs time progressed, the manager continued to bother us to hurry up, we paid, but politely stressed that while we were trying to pick up the pace, we did still have drinks left and planned to finish them (we really were hurrying as we could appreciate that we sat down late).  At this point, however, the manager began to get VERY rude.  \n\nThe manager told us that we would need to take our beer and sakes \"to go\" because HE wanted to go out that night too and needed to close.  In response we said that we could not take alcohol \"to go\" as California law does not allow open alcohol containers on public streets, and we weren't about to all get citations. The manager had become so rude and annoying that he then said we would need to take our drinks in \"to go\" containers, which we agreed to do (janky, I know, but at this point we just wanted to leave, didn't want to be wasteful, and had already paid the bill).   \n\nThe manager retrieved the \"to go\" soup containers, but without tops! We asked if he had tops for his soup containers, and he actually had the gal to tell us that no, they didn't have any.  Thank goodness the cooks saw the whole thing go down and gave us tops to our beer/soup containers.  \n\nThe whole situation was absurd, and to top it all off  I should note that the appetizers we did order were not very good.  I found the gyoza to be tasteless and a little soggy.\n\nNeedless to say that I will not be returning. Ever.", "author": "Alexandra H."}

He makes recommendations for special and unique fish that may have just come in that we wouldn't have tried or known about otherwise.

Only problem is, you have to eat your food in a place designed by somebody whose idea of rock and roll comes from watching The Hills and t-shirts available at the \"awesome\" section of Target while surrounded by typical Marina clientele - who seem more interested in arguing with the hostess about where they should be seated (gotta be seen, brah!) and then ignoring everybody at their table while they play with their iPhones. \n\nLet me put it this way: halfway through our meal, some dudebros came in totally decked out in douchegear: popped collars, hair spiked to the sky, sweatbands around their forearms, perfectly \"distressed\" jeans, etc. After debating where they wanted to sit for about five minutes (not kidding) one of the bro's said loudly, \"this place is pretty rad, dude!\" Yes, dude, pretty rad. \n\nAdded to the whole thing the \"rock and roll\" soundtrack seems to consist mostly of crappy early-80's pop and mid-70's R&B, which would be fine if I wasn't also staring at a picture of Angus Young from AC/DC while I'm trying to eat a roll named after Ozzy Osbourne. \n\nI hate to totally slam the place, because our waitress was pretty good and the food wasn't bad. But general atmosphere counts for a lot, and it was just difficult to enjoy the meal because of the surroundings. \n\nSo, I guess if you enjoy the Marina you'll love Ace Wasabi's.

The wait staff is super nice and even has switched up my wine for me when I didn't like what I originally ordered.  Their happy hour is a good deal where you get half off wine and beer and they even have a great deal on Mondays where they email you a coupon for a free roll.\n\nThis a great place for saki bombs and it is so much fun!!!  If you're not looking for a rock n' roll experience (if you've never been saki bombing then this means you), get there early - no waiting and super service!  All the complaints on Yelp about the service/wait time for food are because they are expecting perfect service at 10pm on a Saturday - that is simply not going to happen at any place in SF with good food that is still open at 10pm and Ace's is serving the party crowd.  So just think before you come here.  6pm on a Wednesday = chill atmosphere, seated right away, great service.  10pm on a Saturday = wait for a table, service will be slow and there will be drunk people - duh!\n\nSome of my fav stuff on the menu includes: the crab salad, seared albacore tataki small plate, the spicy jalepeno tuna roll and the flying kamakazi roll.\n\nKudos to you Ace for being a fun place that still serves great food!", "author": "Carly P."}

For one, it is out of the way in the Marina, where the honey and I rarely go. Secondly, there are like 1,000 sushi joints in San Francisco, so not sure I would have chose a place called \"Ace Wasabi's Rock 'n' Roll Sushi\". I have absolutely no idea what my sushi could be doing that makes it \"rock n roll\", I mean does it play an instrument or something? \n\nBut Groupon ran a special, and I am cheap, so the boyfriend picked one up and we made a plan to go. I love sushi, and the reviews were alright, so I figured it would be okay. It was okay, but just okay. Don't get me wrong, the fish was on par with other sushi joints in this price range, but it was nothing special. They had some really inventive specialty rolls that appeal to the crowd that doesn't like nigiri. I personally prefer just sashimi or fish and rice. We did try some of their hand rolls, and the one with lobster and mango was good. I was actually impressed with the full lobster claw that was in my hand roll. \n\nThey also have a tempura bar which serves two of our favorite veggies, squash and avocado. We had a few pieces of that as well and it was good. The overall atmosphere of the pace is a little weird, the furniture is a little on the cheap side, and the sushi bar was positioned in a weird place, but they definitely go with the rock n roll theme here on their walls and over the speakers. \n\nIn the end, it was a decent meal, and having the Groupon made getting the bill a lot less painful, but I am not sure I will be going out of my way to come here. If I find myself in the Marina and am craving sushi or a light meal, I might stop in again to try another few pieces of nigiri and one of those lobster mango handrolls again.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

I should have known from the start how the evening would pan out considering the heavy list of \"rolls\" rather than quality sushi. To me, if you have to cover up the fish with fried this and mayo that...it's probably not that great. Some rolls can be inspired, but here, they were merely cover ups for poor fish, poor food, and poor service. \n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and were not impressed by the service that was supposed to be led by the man behind the counter. The fact that he hardly spoke English and could not answer our questions was not a good sign. When we got a \"free\" roll - we asked what it was - and were told \"fish\" - thank you for your enlightment.\n\nAt this point I decided I needed a drink if this experience was going to be saved at all. We ordered a shot of the soju with lychee and ended up being served an overly sweet lychee drink that I took two sips of and set aside (we did finally get the right drink order, but not before the meal was over).\n\nThe reason I know that I, who have an open mind and want to like the cuisine that I am paying for, strongly disliked everything about this place and the food in general: my boyfriend said I had to order something else since I had only picked at my meal (because I did not enjoy it at all) - you know what I chose?

We ordered four different rolls: Flying Kamikaze, Dragon, Spider, and Crunchy Sake. The Flying Kamikaze, Dragon, and Spider were all DELICIOUS. Crunchy Sake was a little too sour and odd texture but still had an interesting flavor. We also had the crunchy calamari and rock shrimp small plate and edamame. All of which was fine, not really outstanding or anything.\n\nI was a bit annoyed that we were stuck in the back in kidsville. I think I counted 10 children. There had to have been 5-6 families in the back area. We probably should have insisted on sitting in the front area. The furniture and interior made the place seem hip but the crowd was definitely families with kids. The restaurant also randomly had us all play Bingo which was weird at first but a little fun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-22", "description": "This place is good but not that good. I like it because the rolls are good and it's open late night, but more importantly it's convenient. When you live a 10 second walk away, all of a sudden the better sushi place 4 blocks away is too far and you settle for this. The rolls and sushi are good, they are fairly high quality and tasty. The service is okay, it takes a really long time for anything from a miso soup to edamame. The atmosphere is nice, but it's what's expected from a place called Ace Wasabi in the Marina. I would give this place 4 stars but the one thing I hate is the crowd. The people that usually come here are extremely loud and extremely douche. It is impossible to have a decent conversation when these Marina Animals are inside. The bathroom is pleasantly clean and I hear the happy hour is good. I like this place, but hate the crowd.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-22", "description": "First off, the ambiance. I lovelovelove the rock n roll theme. We sat in the main dining room so I think it was probably easier to absorb the theme, what with the band posters everywhere and the music playing (the playlist was amazing - during the entire time I was there, about 2 hours, I only heard 1 song I disliked). The whole theme was very enjoyable for me. But if you're not a fan of classic rock, or if you're not a music fan at all, you will definitely not appreciate the theme, in fact while looking at the menu you may find yourself getting very confused and asking questions like \"why is it called an Ozzy roll?\"\n\nNow on to the food. It was just three of us so we started with one small plate as an appetizer, the tempura spicy tuna wrapped in shiso leaf. It had a good flavor and surprisingly a decent texture as well. I was concerned with the deep fried leaf idea, and the fact that I wasn't sure what a shiso leaf was, but it ended up being quite delicious. Enjoyable as it was though, I probably wouldn't order it again, but only because I don't like when spicy tuna is deep fried since it starts to cook. After this we ordered 2 Ozzy rolls, 1 Tiger roll, 1 tempura Jagger roll, and 1 Flying Kamikaze roll. All of which the waitress said were the most popular rolls. All were delicious and I was very impressed by the quality and cut of the fish. Everything was fresh and tasty. No odd textures and no \"fishy\" taste. I look forward to returning so I can try their sashimi plate!\n\nIn my opinion, the specialty rolls are definitely the way to go. They're innovative and delicious, but you have to be willing to try something new. The Jagger roll for instance (it was one of the daily special rolls) was deep fried, had cream cheese, spicy tuna, and mango?! (there might have been another ingredient, but I can't recall right now). It was tasty but definitely something out of the ordinary. In fact, most of the rolls we ordered included some ingredient out of the ordinary. The Ozzy roll had fresh jalapeno, which gave it a very nice kick, and the Flying Kamikaze had fresh asparagus which added a lovely crunch for diversity in textures. There was also a roll with glazed pecans, but unfortunately we didn't try it, something for next time :)\n\nAnother thing I liked about this place was the wasabi, it was fresh and creamy. Though, we did have to ask for more because the portion they initially put on the plates was very minimal.\n\nSo aside from small amounts of wasabi, my only other complaints are that the service was somewhat slow and the music wasn't nearly loud enough. The more people in the dining room, the harder it became to hear the music, all you could hear was chattering. Which is fine, but it definitely took away from the ambiance.\n\nBe sure to make reservations if you plan to go after 6. When we arrived around 5:45ish, the phone was ringing off the hook with people trying to make reservations. Not to mention the customers already there. By the time we left, the dining room was completely filled, as was the bar area, and there were people waiting outside.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this place. It is a little pricey, but that tends to be the way it is if you're actually getting good quality fish.", "author": "Claire L."}

Our food came promptly and in a nice order- first edamame, which was as good as any (but it would be hard to screw up salted soybeans). Then came the sashimi platter.

When I was in college living my absolute glory days I vividly remember going to Ace Wasabi to get drunk on sake and stuffed on multiple spider rolls ... how times have changed.  I recently, as in tonight, went to Ace Wasabi to meet up with some old high school friends, 7 year reunion- hello!!! Well, let me tell you, the night turned into a real annoyance and I apparently became a \"nuisance\" to the crowd, well before the rest of our party got there, thank god, buuuut... I was quickly backed up by a great friend who also found our waitress to be a real treat! \n\nSo, I put my name down and the ever so adorable brunette hostess tells me that \"it might be a while\" before we get a table. Sure, someone might say, or how long is the wait, is  another reasonable question.  Well, the reason it \"might be a while\" is because the table of some twenty something hipsters had took over a Marina gem and would go outside to take smoke breaks in the middle of their edamame breaks. So step one: NEVER PRETEND LIKE THE RESTAURANT IS YOUR HOME! After giving them the pissed off stare for multiple minutes we finally sat down. But well before we sat down the owner of the restaurant came out to my group and told us that there was a reservation to come in at 945 that had one of the few tables available, meaning that we would be rushed to eat and get out since it was currently 830 when he notified us of this.  So long story short, we get in and we immediately get hovered over by this space cadet blonde.  A: she has a stink face. B. she is sarcastic but NOT in a charming way. C. maybe she is not sarcastic, just a dummy. D. she gives my roll to my friend who is sitting diagonal from me E. i am waiting for my roll. F. she says \"i'm confused... i thought i brought your roll already\" G. she gave the roll to my friend, didn't tell me that my roll was on his plate and so he ate it. whops. but she also thought it was still on its way out to me H. she brings me a new roll\n\nSo at the end of the night, the owner, who is beyond drunk at this point, comes out to have a quick convo with us, takes the \"extra\" roll off of the bill and tells us that he apologizes for the waitress, that he will have a talk with her and then gives us each a pound, as in a fist pound.

So we ordered to our heart's content. The food and service were both good. Highly suggest sitting at the small sushi bar-- it's fun, and we even got a roll on the house! Out of all the things we tried that night our favorite was the Tiger roll. This roll was recommended by the sushi chef and seriously, it was soo good. Filled with spicy tuna and scallops, and topped with salmon and avocado. It was melt in your mouth goodness. It doesn't sound like much on the menu, but it's definitely worth ordering-- I highly recommend it!", "author": "Kimberly F."}

For once, I guess, one can judge the book by its cover.\n\nAtmosphere was lively even at 10 PM on a holiday Monday.  We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were talkative and fun.  Service was attentive and quick.\n\nSushi itself was a bit disappointing.  We found the salmon a bit rubbery.  Hamachi Lime Roll was more about the cilantro than anything else.  The tai was exceptional, however.  As they were cleaning up the bar, one of the chefs said that they freeze the fish at night to make it last longer which was a bit of a let down, although that might be more commonplace than I imagine.\n\nPrice was very reasonable for sushi but fair for what we got.\n\nAll in all, a fun place for a late night eat.", "author": "David A."}

I probably don't need to but I will elaborate. This place has a buy 1 round, get the 2nd round on the house policy for sake bombs. 1 sake bomb only costs $4.50 so it's a pretty damn good deal.\n\nOther than that, the sushi is also fairly good. We got the sashimi platter and all the fish on it was fresh and cut well. Nice thick cuts that were really flavorful with a good fresh texture. The halibut was possibly some of the best halibut I've had but that's not saying much since I don't usually order halibut as sushi. Here's a breakdown of some of the other food:\n\nCucumber salad: Meh.. I wouldn't get it again. Came out looking like pickles and wasn't very impressive taste-wise.\nAlbacore tataki: HUGE plate of this stuff and pretty good.\nThree Amigos roll: This was one of my favorite rolls. Lots of fish.\nHirame roll: I think this is what it was called. It had lemon, cilantro, jalapeno, and I think it had yellowtail but I could be wrong. It was really tasty and the lemon added this really nice, contrasting flavor. Very delicious.\n\nService was fairly good as well. The staff was very friendly and pretty easy to get ahold of when needed.", "author": "Lauren C."}

They are a bit pricey but I still enjoyed my meal even though they made us pay for the plain edamame.  Any respectable Japanese joint would give have given it to us for free.\n\nSo we started off with the edamame.  You can't really screw that up too bad but my bf did bite into a really gross brown mushy one that made him gag.  There was just one in the bunch.  Then we had the albacore tataki which I thought was delightful!  Mmm, I wish I had more.  I could have eaten the whole plate by myself.  Then we got the rainbow roll.  This was nothing to write home about.  It was poorly constructed and looked sloppy.  Next came the miso cod.  I'm always on the search for good miso cod, butterfish, sea bass and thumbs up to their miso cod.  The rice was a little dry, kinda like it was sitting in the fridge and they fried it up for this dish.  The shitaki mushrooms were also tasty.  Then we got the seafood skewers.  We barely touched those; we were full by then.  But we did go for one and it was dry.  They gave us some ponzu sauce and it totally needed it.  Overall, I was happy.  If I paid full price, (total came to a little over $60 w/out tax and tip), I would have been less happy.  \n\nThe waitress was nice, her smile seemed warm.  Other than that she was uneventful.  It did take her a while to take our order but it was busy.  I can't really comment on their decor since I sat facing the window.  I don't know if I would come back again.  Maybe if someone had a birthday meal there.", "author": "Rosalind S."}

I can't remember.  \n\nWe sit at the table near the window to get the ultimate people watching, and I swear the bartender checked me out.  Or saw how crap I looked.  One or the other.  The menu wasn't as extensive as I would have liked, although if you eat sushi, I suppose there's some nifty stuff on there.  The runner, who also doesn't eat fish (yay) suggested that we get the chicken finger things, which turned out to be delicious.  I also ordered the chicken teriyaki, which was nowhere near as tasty as those chicken fingers.  They also have hot sake with a splash of plum wine, which is pretty tasty.  I ordered my usual sushi staple, the Kappa Maki roll, and it fell apart before I could poke it with my sticks.  Our waitress was great, and put up with the fact that we brought in a case of beer and were trying to float away on a river of sake.

We got the rainbow roll, or something like that, and vegetable tempura and all of it was very, very good. \n\nIHowever, it is a little small and they tried to put us at the low bar in the back, but we asked to move up to the front.

For sushi, we had various nigiri and some of their special rolls. One of the spicy rolls had chopped jalapeno that made it extra good. The fish was all very buttery and good quality. Just when we thought we were good with the amount of food we ordered, the sushi chefs (as playful, goofy and flirty as they were) gave us a ton of other things to try on the house (other nigiri and rolls)! My favorite was the tuna tataki and we were also made a special lobster omelette by Mikey...he insisted that he make something for us even though we were thisclose to exploding from fullness so we just said \"surprise us!\"\n\nJust as we thought we were done gorging ourselvers, he made us dessert in the form of tempura bananas, sliced up and present like sushi, haha. \n\nand lastly, just as we thought that it couldn't get any better, Mikey refused to let us pay the bill no matter how much we protested!

Not necessarily the best quality of fish (which is why nigiri will be a disappointment), but the overall result like fancy rolls, or sashimi with sauces, is edible and well fun to share with drunken friends. The spicy crawfish handroll is actually quite interesting, it is as if you are eating a fusion style lobster roll, but without the Boston style baked bread roll.

My dinner date must know the place well because she requested a table in the back. Our sushi came out pretty quickly and was nice and fresh with a basic presentation. The tuna was really good here and the rest was as expected. Our waitress was nice but not overly helpful and the hostess that night was extremely friendly. What cracks me up is when you walk by the sushi bar and about half of the staff starts saying hi to you in all kinds of broken Engrish! You just expect a hug to come next...nice people.

The server was also quite knowledgeable on the sush and sake.  \n\nThe atmosphere was a little crowded - and it is tough to get a drink as several people are eating at the bar.  The front room is nice because it is a little more open and has a view of the street with all the marina hot mamas rolling around.  However, it is a little generic, and somewhat similar to the decor of a fancy high school cafeteria.  The backroom is cute with brick walls and old movie posters, but I feel it is trying just a little too hard to capture the essence of \"hip\".  The crowd was a bit goofier than usual for the marina.  A gangly, IT-looking double date across from us was seemingly conversing over whether I was tapping both or just one of the girls I was sitting with (me and two quite cute ladies at dinner), where by fact, if you are interested, the answer was neither.\n\nSush!  One of my favorite foods for sure.  Just average.  But certainly not bad.  The jalapeno tuna roll was mediocre, but there was a different specialty roll that was ridiculously hot.  As I type this on friday night (I went out thursday) my lips are still a little irritated.  For the non-specialty rolls I think the 49er roll was solid.  Sake selection was solid, and we were happy with our servers recomendation.  \n\nI am planning on trying Naked Fish soon - and I will compare / contrast.  All in all - its a positive experience, but dont expect anything to \"wow\" you.  I know they have a happy hour on tuesday - I would def. come here again for happy hour - but it wouldnt be my first choice otherwise.", "author": "Aaron D."}

Things started out OK but quickly went downhill. \n\nWe did start with the garden tofu salad with candied pecans and oranges with a nice miso dressing which was great. And it's hard to go wrong with seaweed salad, so they did fine on that count too.\n\nThe food took forever to come, especially the most simple dishes. How hard is it to make vegetarian nigiri? Apparently almost 40 minutes is required to put some avocado on some rice. The fish didn't taste fresh at all and I lost my appetite part way through the meal. However, the BF did love the Garden handroll with tempura asparagus, garlic eggplant and avocado.\n\nThe server was pleasant but we had to flag her down every time we needed refills or wanted to order something. She didn't seem to notice whenever our plates were empty or that we were waiting forever for our food.\n\nThe worst part of the evening though was a large party of belligerent 20-somethings who came straight from the Beer Festival and had been drinking all day. They were literally screaming, throwing food at their table, knocking bottles over and making a very unpleasant dining experience for the rest of us. It's one thing when a baby screams in a restaurant and the parents are trying to control their child who can't be consoled. It's another when you're a 20-something and acting like a teething toddler.\n\nI know this is already a loud restaurant and I'm not complaining about the music or normal conversations that most patrons were having - but this table was making it impossible for anyone else to talk.

Cruncy, sweet, and tangy all at once. I daydream about this, and its only an appetizer.\n\nPhilly roll (I know, I know) is one of my favorites along with the Halibut tempura.

For only $8 you get a maki roll with 2 drinks. The rolls by themselves are only $5. You also have a great variety to choose from with drinks and rolls so this happy hour isn't that \"so-so, it's alright\" typical happy hour food. We ordered the spicy garlic edamame for starters and once again, I found myself licking my fingers and the chopsticks when we devoured all the actual edamame. The rolls we ordered were the jalapeno tuna, new york and the beastie bacon. MMMmmmmm! All of them were so tasty! A typical sushi menu includes the contents of each roll and sometimes you can't taste some of the things listed. We were able to taste every single thing in those rolls. We also ordered the kani cakes with crab and those were delicious, also. Ace Wasabi's is a really cool place and they play mostly Rock & Roll. They have awesome decor in the place and it's not expensive.", "author": "Trina C."}

Thank you to all the Chefs! Thank you to all the Bus Boys and Dish Washers!\n\nI'm here today to tell you my faith has been restored. I can honestly say without any reservation that Ace is back on top of it's game. And yes, I do believe we here at IrascibleChef had something to do with it...\n\nOf course Ken Lowe's response to his loyal customers comments ultimately deservedly gets the credit and thanks! The last time I was back, a short while ago, I proclaimed that Ace was back, but this past visit pushes it over the top!\n\nThe latest addition to Ace's dining room--Akiyo our lovely host and manager visibly present and actively participating in our fantabulous dining experience.\n\nWe did have to wait to be seated (but it was welcomed.) Great, there's a favorite place around the corner to get a drink. We were back within the time limit, but we did have an additional 35 minute wait. No big deal--Asahi and Saki does the soul good.\n\nWhen we were seated we followed the hostess to the back area and this nicely dressed woman apologized for our wait. (I thought that was interesting--very interesting!) I asked the hostess if that was a manager (A visible floor manager was something I highly recommended and had previously been painfully absent.) I was delighted to hear that it was in fact a manager. (I was asked if I would like to speak with her. I said no, knowing I would before the end of the evening.)\n\nWe had many of the past favorites including the Albacore Tataki (which is still the best ANYWHERE,) Tuna and Salmon Tartare Old Style on deep fried Shinto leaves (not on the menu any more--just ask for it Old Style. This time the ingredient I don't care for was isolated--dill and I think a little lemon that starts to chemically cook the tartare.)\n\nOn the rolls side of things we had the Kamikaze--spicy tuna & asparagus wrapped w/ albacore tuna topped w/ ponzu & scallions, which is always a treat, Spider Could be claimed to be the best Spider roll any where, and the newest addition to the USUAL the Ozzy--oh my, it's soooo goood! The Ozzy is crab draped on top spicy tuna, topped with sliced fresh Jalapenos that give the flavor without too much heat--simply scrumptious!\n\nOn the Nigiri side of things--Salmon sushi is my favorite and always a must order--it was fresh and delicious and Hamachi Toro, which I've been getting into lately, was as my brother said, \"that was the best bite!\"\n\n--All was washed down with Asahi and Saki as if there were any doubts...\n\nWe were served quickly with a smile by a helpful, knowledgeable server Marisa who did graciously join us for sip of Saki.\n\nAs we were leaving I stopped to thank Akiyo, whom didn't have business cards yet, gave me some chopsticks with her name and my favorite restaurant in SF it's restoration to excellence. Ken Lowe--great decision, great hire! Thank you!\n\nFor the complete review and commentary visit: http://www.irasciblechef.com/ace-wasabi-restored-to-excellence/", "author": "Irascible C."}

A nice friendly environment with almost an almost club feeling. They have two separate rooms, one seems to be more of a \"party, let's drink and eat!\" room and the other is quieter. We got the quiet room, haha.\n\nSo what we ordered were:\nCrunchy Ace Wasabi Roll\nSpicy Jalapeno Tuna Roll\nNew York Roll \nCrunchy Fried Calamari & Rock Shrimp \nSashimi Deluxe\n\nEverythin was good. No, not good... great! Except for the small plates which were the Crunchy Fried Calamari & Rock Shrimp. The fish tasted fresh and not fishy and the sushi was made very well. I was quite satisfied.

The hostess was nice, the bartender was cool and filled our sake to the brim, but the food was just okay. When we finished, my bf was still a bit hungry and asked to order another roll. The manager came over and said the kitchen/sushi bar was trying to close. I've worked in food service and I know it was a Sunday night, but it wasn't THAT late and there were still LOTS of other patrons in the restaurant. It's not like making one more roll was really going to up his labor cost for the night.  The bartender was super apologetic (because even he thought the manager was being ridiculous) which I appreciated. Honestly though, I was pretty disappointed with this place. There are much better sushi joints in this city. If you're thinking about going here, I'd go to Naked Fish or Mas Sake instead.  They have waaaaayyyyyy better sushi.", "author": "Nicole W."}

But on the other, the atmosphere and service were way less than par. \n\nPositives: We ordered two spicy jalapeno tuna rolls, cajun shrimp roll and chicken teriyaki roll. All were very good. The spicy jalapeno rolls weren't spicy on their own, but the flavor was so strong. You could definitely taste the jalapeno flavor, it just wasnt spicy and overwhelming. Mixed with the wasabi soy sauce and it was super. The chicken teriyaki roll was an experiment we tried. Not bad. Its a nice combination, the sticky rice and teriyaki chicken. The meat was a bit dry but what more can be expected of chicken pieces that probably sit in the cold sushi bar all day. Whatever the case, all were delicious. \n\nNegatives: Out 4 rolls came out on a plate with no ginger or wasabi. At a place called Ace WASABI, how do you forget the most important part of a sushi dish? Since our waiter was MIA, we waited with our food in front of us for almost 10 minutes. They bring you a water glass then expect to use a bottle of water that is already on the table for refills. Unfortunately, the bottles sit on the table, not being refilled. We looked around to other empty tables to find their bottles half full. \n\nOther than that, the atmosphere was just awful. The music was really loud and awful. Luckily we sat in the back where it was a little more quiet. Nevertheless, the back room looked like a pizza parlor complete with red, yellow and green decor and red brick walls! Our waiter came to our table twice duirng our whole time there. We had to get our wasabi and ginger because he was missing. And when he did come over, he was super loud and VERY obnoxious. \n\nI dunno. Up in the air about Ace Wasabi.

I was very surprised by the quality of the food. From the outside, it looked like a dump. The smell of fried food from the pub next door made me sick while waiting for a table at Ace. The decor inside the restaurant was crappy. It reminded me of a college hangout and the crowd was a bit \"frat-tastic\". My friend and I waited about 20 minutes for a table on Saturday night (although it took us 20 minutes to find parking in the Marina district). We were seated at the sushi bar overlooking the kitchen. They had Kirin on tap, which made me happy. I ordered a sampling of nigri: butterfish, yellowtail toro, albacore toro, salmon and the house special kamikaze spicy tuna roll.

I enjoyed all of our food very much and was glad to try some new inventive rolls here.  Try something with jalapeno in it.  I really liked the Ozzy roll and the U2 roll, however, I compare all sushi places to Wasabi and Ginger and this place just isn't as good in terms of food.  But the atmosphere is definitely young and hip.  Actually, so young and hip in fact that in the back of the restaurant where we were enjoying our dinner, we heard \"Happy Birthday\" sung about 6 different times from about 2 or 3 tables.  It was really loud and the people were being obnoxious, but I guess that's what you get with an immature, young crowd.  Anyway, I also found it interesting that they had a web cam here.

We started with the sashimi platter (seemed like a good deal), and my boyfriend put it best when he said \"I feel like I'm doing you a favor\" as he finished off the last few pieces at my urging.  The texture was all wrong for both the maguro and the hamachi, and everything lacked flavor.  It was as if the fish had been frozen or something.  Then the rolls were all pretty standard.  Not terrible but definitely not great.  However, the WORST part of the meal was the piece of butterfish nigiri I ate.   I almost gagged, seriously.  It was watery, chewy, and tasted like plastic.

He tells us to play while he's showing us our table because you can win a $20 gift card for your next visit! And whaddaya know...my friend Sarah wins! NICE!

The rolls aren't really anything super special, but there were a couple that were pretty interesting. Tempura Jagger roll was oh so bad for me but oh so yummy. The jalapeno poppers (filled with hamachi) were excellent. The thing that really threw me over the edge was the Osaka beef. I am a firm believer in knowing where are when you order, and thus never order cooked meat at a sushi place. The boy wanted to try it, however, so we did. It was so good. Some of the best sauce I've ever had, and the meat was cooked perfectly. Honestly, I would go back just for that.

There was really no need for one since we were dining pretty early but the groupon said we needed reservations so we made one. We were seated in a table in the front of the restaurant. I've read reviews saying it gets pretty rowdy here but that wasn't the case that night. It was probably because we came early - good thing. We decided on the tuna and salmon tartar appetizer, the steiner, kamikaze, three amigos, and a garden. The bf also had a miso soup. Since I had yelped this place early on I knew I had to order the tuna and salmon tartar because everyone raved about it. It was the best dish that night! The tuna and salmon surprisingly went well with the guacamole and ponzu. I never thought about eating raw fish with guac but it certainly works well! Since the bf does not like raw fish by itself I pretty much ate most of it myself. I was almost already half full at this point and I had not even started on our rolls yet! The steiner, garden, and three amigoes were the best ones and kamikaze the least. Overall I thought the rolls were ok but not amazing. The bf liked them though. I've definitely had yummier rolls elsewhere but it sure was a lot of food. I was hoping to order dessert for our remaining balance but we were told they donot serve dessert. No dessert? How absurd! The waitress told us we had accumulated $51 so figuring we had just four dollars left we ordered a shitake tempura for another $2 even though we were already really full. We paid and took leftovers home. We didn't realize until we were on the car ride home that we did not claim our full $55 worth of food. When she said $51 she should have said $51 with tax because we could have ordered another $8 worth of food to go... =/ The food is not yummy enough for me to want to come back though I do have to say the rice from the leftovers was not hard or anything so I was able to eat it cold just fine the next day.", "author": "Helen L."}

I didn't know I liked sake, as I've only tried the hot (sake bomb) sake.  They have a really great menu at Ace Wasabi, really something for everyone.  A sushi beginner or expert could be equally happy here.  I had the spinach gomae and the cucumber salad to start.  Okay, the cucumber salad is amazing!!  So fresh, crisp, and has a bite to it (due to the spices they put on the cucumbers).  If you love Korean cucumbers, you'll adore this version.  We had the ahi toro nigiri, which melted, so buttery, in my mouth.  My sister ordered the california roll and added daikon (tasted a bit weird with the daikon- but that's my sister's issue), which was tasty.  The crab meat is fresh and not imitation, and it's not a crab salad mix.  Just straight crab, yum.  We also had the green beans- spicy and hot.  Solid food, great selection, and a clean place.

When my friend invited me for free sushi, of course I could not decline. We ventured out into the Marina. We made a reservation which didn't seem like it mattered because they sat us down right away without asking if we had a reservation. We sat in the front room and the music was kind of loud. A mixture of top 40 and random rock. I ordered the kamikaze chicken fingers to start. I loved the spicy garlic aioli sauce too. I had the Ozzy Roll which was also delicious.  It had tempura shrimp with spicy sauce and sliced jalapenos. I loved the jalapenos on top it was the perfect touch of spicy. We came back a few weeks later and I ordered the same thing with an Anchor steam. The food was consistently good. We didn't have a reservation the second time and I wish we had-since there was a long wait for a Monday nite. The service was not as great the second time either. No one refilled our drinks-which you kind of need when you are eating sushi-especially when there are jalapenos on top. I  wanted a second Anchor steam but no one ever came around to ask to refill it. They also never brought us plates! We were eating out of our soy sauce mini plate. It was a little strange that the server never picked up on that. I wouldn't come here for an intimate date. Great for may be a loud group or a good friend outing, not somewhere I would go if you wanted to have a serious conversation.", "author": "Kristy H."}

Waitress comes back about 5 minutes later to tell us verbatim - I'm sorry but we can't make an Elvis because we're short handed tonight and it's too complex..can you order something else? So we order another roll. 45/50 minutes later our food comes. Tempura is cold and soggy in one of the rolls. The other was supposed to have seared albocore- which was torched beyond being edible. Bill comes rather quickly, and no apology, nor discount, is made for an hour wait for marginal sushi.

They also have a number of dishes that work well for kids (best chicken fingers ever!) and the back room is always family friendly. Bingo is also tons of fun for the little ones.

We waited 30 minutes for our raw fish order to arrive after the waitress claimed it was coming after about 20 minutes!  Subsequent orders didn't take as long.  We could sometimes hear the rock music coming from the speaker only one table away--over the noise of people yelling across tables to be heard!  When I left, my hearing was dulled as though I just left a live music concert!  Three Amigos roll was good but fell apart to the point that we had to eat it in little pieces.  Wahu was good, and the grilled jalapeno was uniquely good.  Seaweed salad was also good. Otherwise, this was pretty mediocre all around.  Their Specialty rolls mostly have nuts and spicy mayonnaise, which doesn't appeal to me--I prefer the more traditional stuff.

Go to Moki's on Cortland in Bernal instead--they have an extensive menu that also includes cooked dishes, better atmosphere, pretty fast service, and the ability to have normal-volume conversation!", "author": "K G."}

Lets get things straight off the bat: I dislike the Marina and the crowd which comes with it.  Ace Wasabi was filled with these people, so pretty, rich, happy and white. The service was good. Considering that it was fairly busy on a Friday having only two mistakes by the waitress was impressive.  First she asked if we were ready to order, we said yes and she looked away and bounced from our table for a few minutes. Second she should have left our table with a bottle of water to refill our cups or had her bus person more on top of that.  At one point she came up with water and refilled my glass and the woman sitting across from myself.  She then turned to the table next to ours which she had just laid down the check and asked if they needed more water.  Both of them had water in their cups, while another at my table had an empty cup.  She filled the other cups at my table (two remaining) but we shouldn't have had to have a member wait with an empty cup.  So even though I thought overall she rocked as a server, I am docking a star for the two screw ups. The servings of Wasabi were pathetic, so I am docking another star for that. How can you be a Wasabi Ace without any wasabi?", "author": "Max R."}
