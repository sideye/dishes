If the MealPal meal is any indication of how great it would be to eat in or order anything else to go, this place should be a wonderful! \n\nWith my meal I received 6 pieces of a spicy hamachi roll and 6 pieces of a spicy tuna roll. Each were delicious, tasted fresh and were perfectly spicy. The rolls were huge! I could barely finish everything - but I did hehe. In addition to the rolls I had the side noodle salad which consisted of veggies, skinny noodles and a heavy creamy sauce. Like the sushi, the side was cold but it had good flavor and I enjoyed it.\n\nMy order was ready when I went to pick it up and the man that helped me was so nice and smiley. The restaurant is located off Pine in Chinatown - right on the corner. You can't miss it. Highly recommend!", "author": "Bri T."}

The fish was pretty fresh and everything was created nicely and presented beautifully. I've heard that depending on who the sushi chef is, the food differs.

The meal was great and the service was usual for an asian restaurant. It wasn't anything over the top, or special, but it was a great fix for our home sickness. Also, there is A TON of choices! Which is great! (Even for vegetarians) \n\nThey're fish is safe and they're dishes are very similar to what you would get at any Japanese restaurant, we both enjoyed being able to have a nostalgic meal away from home. \n\nThey also do delivery which is awesome! But the food quality drastically drops, so beware! \n\nNice service, quick and efficient, not very talkative. Great if you're used to eating out in asia. \n\nCheers!", "author": "Alisa K."}

Totally affordable.\n\nHOWEVER, if I had to rate the service ONLY...oh boy...The first waitress, who took our (my parents and I) order, was nice. But then, another waitress stepped in and wow, killjoy. First, she seemed pretty annoyed when I asked for dessert when she brought the bill. Sorry, I didn't know it was such a pain in the a** to add an item on the bill. Also, lucky her, I knew what I wanted so she didn't have to bring me the menu. At the end, we wanted to pay by card. While she was away minding her business, I told my parents that I really did not want to give her tips because of her behavior. Instead of not giving tips, we decided to pay a round sum. Then, she came back and told us the card was denied. Alright, that's fine. We paid by cash. And when we thought we were done, she pointed on the bill the suggested tips. Like...she was forcing us to give her tips. Like...who the f*** does that? My mom ended up doing a petty move and poured all of her coins from her purse on the table. That was brilliant.\n\nNow, I know it's Christmas. I can understand working on Christmas is awful. But why do you have to be rude to people who came to your restaurant to enjoy a meal and who did nothing to you? Why do you think it is ok to behave this way? If it happened in my dear lovely home country France, I would not mind at all because tips is not part of our culture. But here, in the US, I heard that's something quite serious. So please, next time, if you feel like you are going to be rude to customers, just sit in a corner of the restaurant and think about why you should probably get a new job.

VERY fresh and flavorful.  The sushi chef gets five stars.  The service, one star - unless there is a way to give a zero.  No smiles.  We felt as if we were imposing on them and we were one of two tables for lunch at first.   Even when we asked for drink refills, we didn't them. While we were there, 4-5 more diners were set.  The table next to us had two small children.  So they asked for forks for them to eat with. The \"manager\" turned away from them abruptly and rolled his eyes.  He was facing us so we got to see him.  Lovely.  That was typical of the service from him and our waitress.  If you go, get takeout.  We feel bad for the chef.

So then I stumbled across this spot again and decided to give it a go.\n\nGreat spot for watching the throngs of tourists go by as it is situated on an upper level with lots of windows. Not exactly authentic Japanese, but it is a-ok. \n\nThe first plate of cucumber/wakame salad was not vinegary or salty enough. Nice that it is complimentary though.\n\nI had the larger tempura ($12.25) for dinner which you can also get in a smaller size. I think for the extra $2, you get an extra 1/3 of food. I say it's worth it. Everything was in multiples of threes: three prawns, three onion rings, three eggplants, three sweet potatoes, three zucchini pieces. You do get miso soup and rice as well. My only beef with it was that it was too crispy. Like painful crispy. Like this-hurts-my-gums-to-bite-into-this crispy. I think maybe they used too much flour in the tempura batter? \n\nLiked the cast iron teapots you get at your table. They also serve up genmai cha which is always nice on a cold blustery San Francisco evening. \n\nSince I don't have the luxury of having a Yelp app on my phone, I would probably come here again instead of taking a gamble.

We stumbled upon this place in a hungry and thigh-burnt daze after walking up all those hills, but if I wasn't so hangry... I'm not quite sure this place would have been my first choice. \n\nThe place is quite clean. The seating is just average and there are tv's for your viewing pleasure (they were playing pre-season football games so +1). The food was quite meh, except for one this which was horrid, and another thing which was absolutely delicious. The service is pretty bad (sorry). All but one waiter couldn't speak English which just made everything so much harder. \n\nHere's my rundown on the food:\nMiso soup: pretty standard\nSeaweed salad: awesome! had some cucumber in the mix too, which made it light and fresh\nSexy roll: I was quite confused when this arrived at my table and I was absolutely horrified when I tried it. It is described as \"Imitations crab roll top with fresh salmon lightly baked with cheese\" I MISINTERPRETED the \"lightly baked cheese\" as being cream cheese (as you would find in other sushi rolls), but I was shocked to see that it was a Kraft single. Look, I love Kraft singles just as much as the next guy, when it's melted in between two pieces of bread because it was a staple of my childhood, but there's a huge flavor difference between melted Kraft singles and non-melted/cold Kraft singles. Needless to say, the cheese was not melted so I peeled it off and proceeded to eat my imitation crab roll with salmon on top. It was delicious.\nDaegi roll: Pretty good. Just the right amount of spice and the fish tasted fairly fresh.\n49ers: Also pretty good.\nBroiled squid: SO GOOD. Best part of my meal- hands down. The squid was tender. It was not overcooked, and it had a great flavor to it. I wish I just ate like 4 of these as my meal. It was delicious. If there's one thing this place knows how to do right, it's the broiled squid.\n\nI found this place to be a bit pricey for the very underwhelming food that we received, but I felt that the squid was just amazing. Will I come back? Maybe, if I want to avoid all the places in SF with a crazy line up outside, but maybe not. Might come back for the squid though.", "author": "Leanne M."}

I don't eat sushi super often, but was excited to see how this place would turn out.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience.  It's not super fancy, but you sort of get what you pay for.\n\nWe arrived later in the evening and were seated right away. Much to our dismay, there was a table of loud obnoxious drunks that made a ton of noise the whole time.  But I guess that's not uncommon in chinatown. As others have mentioned, we were were served miso soup and seaweed salad immediately.  Even if it isn't the greatest, it is free and quite enjoyable if you're already a little hungry.\n\nBeing vegans, our options were limited but the menu was huge.  We ended up getting a few different kinds of veggie rolls, some fried tofu bits, and fried potato things. The veggie rolls were all done fairly well, though my favorite were the kappa and avocado rolls. I thought the mixed veggie rolls didn't have enough of a distinct taste (including so many different chopped up radishes, peppers, and mushrooms).  Fried tofu is fried tofu, but the sauces that accompanied them were pretty tasty (one a teriyaki, the other I'm not sure what.) The fried potato appetizer almost reminded me of a samosa, as it was mashed potato with some peas in it. But instead of coming in a large fried dumpling shape it was flat and crispy.\n\nThe waiters and waitresses that attended to us were friendly and timely with their attention.  However, we ordered veggie tempura and they never brought over to us.  We're pretty sure another table got it by mistake, even though we were still charged. When we notified them of the mistake, they took it off our bill with no hassle (rightfully so.) They also served little scoops of ice cream at the end, but sadly, it was not the sort of ice cream we can partake of.  Perhaps, sushi rock, if you offered non-dairy ice creams at the end of the meal I might be inclined to give you an extra star...", "author": "Jon T."}

Speak up, yo!\n\nIt was the most epic failing of a restaurant I had ever seen.  If you ever wonder why restaurant crew come together for a meeting before the start of a shift, it's probably to avoid abominations like these.\n\nFirst.  We showed up around 8pm.  There were about 6 servers working-- one chef behind the sushi bar.  People look swamped.  Inexperienced.  PANICKING.  \nOk,  I get that it's the President's Day Weekend (minus a Bay Bridge), but really? You should think about staffing competent people for a long weekend.  We quickly blended in with the group of unaddressed people standing at the door.  Adequate staffing FAIL.\n\nSecond.  People look pissed.  Correction:  EVERYONE looks pissed.  What's going on?  The server starts bringing out our order but kept placing all the plates/bowls/appetizers on an EMPTY seat (we were a party of 3) and we had to re-route all the settings amongst us.  WTF?  Obviously this guy has no idea how to serve.  Competent staffing FAIL.\n\nThird.  We quickly realize why people look pissed.  Orders weren't being placed in the right order.  We got our food before this couple who said loudly \"Wait, they got their food??\".  They had placed an order over 20 minutes ago.  The server straight up forgot.  And guess what?  There were a whole bunch of other tables without their food.  Some people walked out after complaining.  Serving FAIL.\n\nThe pandemonium is reaching its peak.  The restaurant is filled with sweet sweet bitterness.  One server turns on the stereo to drown out the sound of anger with some music.  GWEN STEFANI BLASTS THROUGH THE SPEAKERS.  The staff runs back.  He can't figure out how to lower the volume for nearly 10 seconds.  People look more pissed.  Vibe FAIL.\n\nDecision:  They really need to scrub this place up with proper staffing-- and then I probably still wouldn't consider returning.  Having one overwhelmed sushi chef isn't going to take you anywhere.", "author": "Eugene L."}

It took them a bit of time for the sushi to get there. We took our time eating the rolls. We spent like 2 hours there, just eating and chatting. They didn't rush us. T\nhen we ordered the fried banana and the ice cream but the waiter was kind enough to tell us that the fried banana came with ice cream. We got to ice creams with the fried banana. One was lychee and the other was mango. Don't know if they had more flavors but it would have been nice for them to let us choose the flavors we wanted. The fried bananas were pretty good but we didn't finish cause we didn't want to eat so much trans fat. Overall the experience was good.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Or maybe its just this location? Today was my first time dining at Sushi Rock. I ordered the Mango Spider Roll, Dragon Roll & Ki Ki Roll.  i thought the Mango Spider Roll was JUST OK but the price was not worth it (14.95!) and the Dragon roll was JUST OK too. The rolls was nothing special. I thought the avocado looked kinda old on top of the Dragon Roll so far i haven't had any stomach aches! lol. The only one i really liked was the Ki Ki Roll which was known to be VERY SPICY as stated in the menu but it wasn't THAT spicy. I miss Sushi Rika! \n\nHowever, my sister ordered the MoMo Roll which was very good. \n\nThe service was good, the only set back was the waitress forgot my Mango Spider Roll. Maybe i shouldn't have said anything because i could have save myself $15 bucks for an OK special roll. I don't really care about the price but i thought the flavors and presentation was not worth $15 bucks.\n\ni doubt i will come back to Sushi Rock or maybe ill try the other locations.

We proceeded to sit for a good half hour while the bento box and rice were picked through (intentionally slowly) and eventually finished.

That would be Sushi on the Run in Los Gatos.  But that's in Los Gatos, and you are a mere hop, skip, and a jump away.  You even encourage me to be lazy by delivering my favorite rolls to me any time after 5 PM with only a $20 order minimum.  You give me extra miso soup sometimes, too.\n\nYou seem to think I eat a lot for one person, though, because you tend to include at least 3 pairs of chopsticks.  That's okay because I hoard them, who ever remembers to buy chopsticks? Not me.\n\nYou ARE great sushi from my experience in San Francisco.  When I'm in the mood for some unauthentic sushi (creative rolls) you fit the bill perfectly.  My favorite is the Waye Roll with its crazy pink nori wrap, tuna, cucumber, fish egg, and tempura crispies tucked inside.  Potentially my favorite roll in the whole world.  Your tamago nigiri is yummy, too.\n\nThe katsu donburi is excellent, and I can usually turn the leftovers into at least 2 extra meals.  That's a STEAL!\n\nI like eating in at your location, too, when I have visitors.  The free cucumber & seaweed salad is really good.  The service is friendly, and the view of Chinatown below makes for good people-watching.\n\nSo, Sushi Rock, I just wanted to thank you for being you, and I'll ignore the haters forever.  Even if my mom is included in those haters.", "author": "Mary O."}

My lady, tuna, shrimp tempura and avocado roll. This came with a bowl of rice and salad. Tempura came hot and light and crispy and delicious. Unagi had a way too much glaze and it made the eel very sweet. The salmon, however, was very fresh and was grilled so the skin was nice and crispy and it had a smooth smoky flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-26", "description": "I'm incredibly surprised at how low the ratings are for this place.  I've been eating here for a couple of years already and when I first started coming two years ago, the ratings were great.  I now feel like after they started doing the restaurant.com promotions (and hey I use it everytime too so I'm not complaining but...) their ratings have just gone down from 4.5 stars to only 3 stars!!  So apparently on top of being cheap (as I am), people are also incredibly harsh. \n\nI honestly feel like this is a great restaurant.  My entire company (we're at 600 California Street right at the heart of the financial district) loves coming here.  Okay, so not many of us are Japanese or Sushi experts but we enjoy what they have.  Most people don't even use the discount, only us lowly admins (hehe) but they still seem to enjoy it.  Also, my family & friends that I bring here also always enjoy it.  I've never had a complaint and I have honestly given this place a ton of business.  People I know always want to come back.  Even without the discount, the price for sushi here is still incredibly reasonable.\n\nAlthough the claim is that the sushi is not as authentic as it should be, I think it's always delicious and fresh.  Whenever I use the $25 gift certificate and spend $35, we always get a TON of food.  $10 each for two people for a sushi dinner including tip is pretty damn good if you ask me!!  That's if you're in Japan, NYC, or even just at the mall!!  It honestly can't get any better than that.\n\nOkay, so for the actual update review.  My friend and I came here last night for dinner since we were going to the ballet and wanted a great and fast place to eat before going.  \n\nWe got :\nFREE miso soup & cucumber/seaweed salad (not all places do this so I'm always happy that they do)\nPhiladelphia roll, Golden Gate roll, and Rock N'Roll\nScallop & prawn salad\nDeep fried banana & 2 scoops of ice cream (also complimentary!!)\n\nThe rolls were good!  Soup & salad always good.  The scallap/prawn salad was excellent but my friend really didn't like it.  I scarfed it up.  The banana dessert is always so delicious with the ice cream.  I really did enjoy myself and I was so full my dress barely fit.  My only complaint was that I was terribly uncomfortable at the ballet & a bit sleepy after eating so much food.\n\nHowever, I will absolutely NOT complain about the $11.00 I spent that evening.  Our bill came up to $22.11 with tax & tip after the restaurant.com $25 gift certificate I bought for $2!!!!  I'm sorry but that's freakin unbelievable!  On top of all that, they still give the freebies... the soup, salad, and ice cream were all complimentary and I'm sure we're not the only ones they do this for!!  Every time I have come they always do this. \n\nI know that people enjoy coming here because every month the gift certificates sell out for this restaurant over every other restaurant on that website for the financial district AND chinatown area.  I'm saddened by those people that probably eat here frequently and take advantage of this offer every month yet still give them a mediocre rating.  I honestly believe that just on SERVICE alone, they get an excellent review.  The staff is always incredibly accomodating and attentive.  The owner always looks stressed out (I can imagine why) but he is still always really nice and friendly.\n\nOkay and yes they do play a little Miley Cyrus.  I did chuckle when I heard her song playing but honestly, is that truly a reflection of the food & service?  Are you really that much of an anti-Miley fanatic that it's that big of a deal for you to live through or completely hate on a great business just for that?  Maybe grow up just a little bit... \n\nAnyway, on top of all this... it's at a great spot.  It's one of those restaurants where it's very open and the windows go all around the restaurant so it's nice to people watch while you're eating your sushi.  Even though it's not a swanky place.

The Rock Box meals are a DEAL ($11.95) and come with TONS of food - if you're okay with one of your choices to most likely be teriyaki. I've also had all of their udon choices, which are also good on a cold San Francisco night. The potato croquette \"appetizer\" is HUGE - 4 croquettes and katsu sauce. The prices aren't bad at all, but the staff I have encountered on the phone or when I go to pick up take out really aren't too friendly.\n\nThe music there is meh.

I should mention that it was also around 3 pm, so any lunch crowd that this place might have was gone (which is good, 'cause I really didn't want to be seen inhaling hella sushi by some hot FiDi dudes, especially when I look like crap).  This Sushi Rock is also right on the corner of Pine and Grant streets, and is on a second level and has windows that look right over  the intersection, so it's great for people-watching.\r\n\r\nI was promptly seated and given a menu, as well as  complimentary miso and seaweed salad (both of which weren't that great),  They have flat screen TVs showing sitcoms like \"Small Wonder\" (yay!) and \"The Nanny\" (lame!), and they also kept some hyper-ass trance music playing in the background (which I feel has a similar affect to fast-food colors, it just kinda rushes you a bit).  My waiter was very nice and attentive but not too in-my-face, and their tuna and Philedelphia rolls were excellent!  They were very fresh, with huge chunks tuna and salmon.  \r\n\r\nI've been looking for a place in the Financial District (or nearby) that's a couple of notches above the \"Go Go Sushi\" at 1 Post St., but is also not too chi-chi and expensive, and I think I've found it! \r\n\r\nI'll definitely be back :)", "author": "Karen F."}

The exact location has been a sushi restaurant for a many years. It was Ginza for the last 3 or 4 years and Sake Bomb before that. And the quality of fish went down when it became Sushi Rock. \n\nAs with many American sushi places, the nigiri pieces are cut too large. It's supposed to be one bite! If the texture of the fish is off and the piece is big, I find myself gagging to get it down. This happened with a piece of tai at Sushi Rock. Not enjoyable. The maguro was grainy too. We sat at the bar and asked what was good that day and were served mediocre fish. A good sushi chef will tell you if something isn't that great that day. A really good sushi chef (like Ted at Hamako) won't even buy the fish that day if it's not good.\n\nI did enjoy their signature rolls immensely, but not sure each bite was worth $2. The mango spider roll rocked my world (ha ha ha) with the cold fruit on top of a warm roll with excellent lightly breaded tempura inside. I also had an excellent roll with white soybean paper instead of nori and tempura asparagus inside. But as with almost anything, if you deep fry it, it's good. \n\nOur bill was nearly twice what it would have been when the same place was Ginza, and it's not because it cost them anything to rennovate, because the only thing they did was add 2 TVs and put up their awning.\n\nYou'll love Sushi Rocks if you don't know much about good fish.

OK, let's try that.  Wrong!  Rice fell apart before you put it in your mouth.  Ugly presentation.  Rough edges.  I can do a better job with my plastic sushi maker!  So maybe this is a place for the extended menu of soba, udon, and other rice dishes...?  Not true, either.  Horrible soba.  It tasted like frozen microwavable soba I bought from the supermarket in Taiwan.  Horrible tempura.  Worse than the Hawaiian version of shrimp tempura from L&L.\n\nMaybe this is a place I should NEVER come back to?  Ditto.", "author": "Jiajia C."}

While enjoying the \"Chinatown tourist experience\" on a rainy day, this restaurant was a welcome spot to warm up, grab lunch, and talk with a friend.  \n\nI wasn't super impressed with the decor, but the inside was clean and had some interesting art.  There was a TV along one wall and some simple artwork strategically placed.  A perk - there were large windows along 2 of the walls that took advantage of the corner views from it's 2nd story location over Grant St.  For someone like me who loves to people watch, this made for great lunchtime entertainment.  \n\nThe best part of my experience here - the moment we were seated the waitress dropped 2 bowls of miso soup and a salad in front of us (ie. heaven if you're been walking around in 45 degree rainy weather!).   The sushi was decent - my friend and I split several rolls including shrimp tempora and salmon/avaocado.  Everything tasted fresh and the presentation was typical for a Japanese restaurant (simple yet pleasing).  \n\nThe prices were very reasonable and the service was friendly.  I would argue that this place is definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area.", "author": "Angela Z."}

We've been to the Polk St location before and figured this was their second location. We talked to the server and this spot was opened last two months ago and a third will be opening on Geary and 5th.\nWe ordered the mango and tuna sushi roll $14.95, pretty steep considering that it was a slice of tuna over rice and stuffed with mango and cucumber! They didn't even give an entire cube of mango but mixed it partially with cucumber.\nWe ordered a combo box to share (pick any three items) so we picked the salmon teriyaki, seabass teriyaki and chicken teriyaki. The box arrived and the presentation was somewhat lacking. The fishies and chicken were just tossed over beds of lettuce and cabbage in the three different columns. It might just be me but sometimes, presentation does matter to make it more edible and appealing. Oh well, the price tag for the box $11, seems a lot better deal than the mango tuna sushi. Overall, service was friendly, attentive and quick.", "author": "Yan M."}

It wasn't very expensive, but at this price I've certainly had better.\n\nLater, my dining partner returned here with his parents--he thought his dad might be keen on having a nice, big tuna steak masquerading as sashimi--but even his family wasn't really very keen on Sushi Rock.\n\nIn conclusion: bland, bland, bland.

What I got was very bland, definitely not fresh, and very disappointing.  I am convinced that this Miso soup was made with urine and at least a week old.  It seems like from the past reviews this is a place you have got to be drunk to enjoy....The service i received was decent and the staff was nice enough, but this is definitely the TACO BELL OF THE SUSHI WORLD.  If i were to return, it would be for the cheap liquor and not the food...if you are looking for anything of quality, DO NOT GO HERE,...if you want to sip cheap sake on happy hour and soak it up with Safeway style sushi....then this is the place for you...for me it was just a mistake.", "author": "Jack F."}

Tonight the results were so awful that I won't be ordering from these folks again.  The maguro was literally so tough that it would have required a steak knife to cut it properly.  This is at $4.50 per PIECE/ $9 for two.  The fish wasn't toxic/smelly/bad - it was just tough as New York ribeye.  The the salmon was better but not by much.  Never again.", "author": "Rob R."}

I usually end up getting the udon which is quite tasty, but I've had the sushi a few times. Wayo a couple blocks away is a bit better and quite a bit calmer.", "author": "John P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-03", "description": "This is the place to go if you want cheap and big portions.  I've never seen any sushi roll so huge or sashimi so thick (thick but not good).  They serve the typical bento boxes, sushi rolls, sashimi, etc. which are decent but if you want good fresh sashimi, do not go there.  You'll be so disappointed cause the salmon and albacore sashimi they brought out was still half frozen.", "author": "Kate L."}

Their menu seemed ok and the decor was adequate, but the quality, portion, and appearance of the food was horrific.  My friend and I ordered the una-ebi roll and the futo-maki roll to begin with, and that ended it for us.  First of all, the service was slow and they forgot the egg in the futo-maki and we had to have it sent back.  Secondly, the pieces were too thin and few to even constitute an entire \"roll\" of sushi.  Thirdly, the sushi looked horrible, unevenly cut, pieces of the filling sticking out everywhere, etc.  Lastly, the sushi tasted horrible - the rice was too gooey, the inside of the futo-maki included very non-standard vegetables and their flavors didn't blend well, there wasn't enough rice-wine vinegar, and the entire thing was lacking in flavor.  We were really upset at this place.  Anyone who knows even moderately good Japanese food knows this place is an embarrassment to San Francisco...", "author": "K K."}

I have had sushi all over the country and you would think that being that San Francisco is right on the ocean, and a major metropolitan area with a large Japanese and Chinese population, that the sushi would be excellent!  Unfortunately, this was the worst I've ever experienced and I could hardly choke it down - if I hadn't been starving, I don't think I could have managed it.  The rice was overcooked in my rolls - soggy and warm with no seasoning at all.  The inner ingredients were only identifiable by color, not by texture or flavor.  We had three different rolls and none of them were palatable.  The Beijing roll had duck (I'm guessing) and a horrible sauce.  My softshell crab was soggy.  My daughter's miso soup bowl had some encrusted filth on the outside.  They didn't serve hot tea - only water was complimentary.  And the bathrooms????   Filthy and no soap.  The restaurant was not very clean.  I had to stand up to signal them that I needed our bill, even though only three tables had patrons.  The only upside was that we enjoyed watching the shoppers go by outside the windows.  There is a better Sushi bar down the street (north) a couple of blocks, so if you are in the mood for sushi, keep walking!", "author": "C T."}

A friend of mine had told me I had to check out Sushi Rock because it was really good.  When I came to SF to visit my boyfriend, I made sure to go here.  I have to admit, I was a little disappointed.  It was OK, nothing great...  I came home and was talking to my friend about it.  Apparently, she got the wrong name.  She thought SUSHI GROOVE was really good.  I haven't gotten a chance to check out the RIGHT restaurant, but I'm pretty sure it will be better than Sushi Rock!", "author": "Leslie R."}
