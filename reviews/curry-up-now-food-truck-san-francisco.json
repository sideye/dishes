I mean, I guess the tikka masala could have been sub-par, but I would have mentioned that already by this point. It was perfect - I only wish I'd had more.\n\nTo make an already great thing even better - I snagged a grilled cheese sandwich from another truck (Upper Cut) and these fries served as my side item. This could not have been a more perfect marriage. These two trucks should definitely combine to form one business and call this combination \"Party In My Mouth.\" They'd make millions - both dollars and smiles.", "author": "Brett N."}

Once at a local Farmers Market Festival, and most recently, at a work event. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is probably the best I've ever had. The sauce has plenty of tomato/creamy goodness with just enough kick (but not too much). It comes with turmeric white rice, chana garbanzo masala, and pico kachumbe. What really makes this dish stand out is the succulent chicken. It's perfectly cooked. Never dry. Always tender. \n\nIf you're looking for a quick meal that's more portable, I'd highly recommend one of their burritos. My favorites are the Tikka Masala and the Ghee Makhni Butter burrito. Each burrito comes in a flour tortilla, with turmeric white rice, chana garbanzo masala, and sliced onions. De-lish!\n\nThere are other things on the menu that I'm still eager to try, including: the Kashmiri Lamb rice bowl, the Naughty Naan, the Indian Tacos, and Sexy Fries (an Indian-inspired poutine - criss cut sweet potato fries, cheese, and your choice of protein).\n\nI can't recommend this food truck enough.

The menu sounded pretty exciting and innovative, but the food was missing that Indian umph, that special burst of flavor.  I found all of the entree elements to be far too sweet, from the chana to the chutney to the chicken tikka.  There was no spiciness, either in terms of spices for flavor or hot pepper spice.  It did the trick, but missed the mark for that Indian zest.  The food wasn't bland, but certainly not spiced as I would've expected.  What was excellent, however, was the mango lassi.  The flavor was perfect--just the right amount of mango, the perfect sweetness, and the perfect size for the price.  For me, this item is a definite must try.\n\nWhat concerns me is that I asked if the inside out samosa had wheat because the menu made no mention of actual samosas or samosa wrappers, and I am very much gluten intolerant.  When I asked, the lady said no, but at the table, before taking a bite, I found the dish to be full of mini samosas, and a large one.  Those are definitely made of flour.  \n\nWhen I went back up with my dish and asked about it, she still said no flour.  Then, I showed her a mini samosa on the spoon to be sure I had the right dish.  She says yes, right dish, no wheat, just flour.  Everyone makes mistakes, but that could've been a very costly one.  I would've been sick for weeks, at minimum.  Some people would be willing to sue over that, had they eaten it, so hopefully she knows now.  Upon asking, She let me exchange my dish, but she wasn't too enthused.  Sorry, but no fad diet here.

Instead they'll give you the Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of vegetarian curry then pass it off as something they have done for a long time.  Second the vegetarian curry/garbanzo beans they did give me were stone cold...

Fortunately, they're also at Friday's Off The Grid at Civic Center and SOMA StrEat Park by my new work, so when I stopped by OTG for lunch, I decided I finally had to try this truck.\n\nThe menu is basically all Indian fusion (like burritos, bowls, fries, naan sandwiches). Obviously not amazing Indian food, but for Indian fusion and for a truck, it's pretty damn good. Not too pricey either and the portion size is reasonable. It's super quick too; my order was ready in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI ordered the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA BOWL ($8.50) instead of the popular burrito because I wasn't really feeling a tortilla that day. Plus, a bowl felt less messy to eat. I LOVE spicy food so I ordered mine spicy, which they describe as \"pretty darn hot\" on the menu. I was worried I wouldn't find their \"spicy\" to be remotely spicy at all because that tends to happen to me at a lot of places, but they don't kid around! I still would've liked it a little spicier, but it had a pretty good kick to it. The chicken was cooked well and the tikka masala was very flavorful.

A very crispy samosa shell along with a great dipping sauce and filling. Please note that it contains a whole egg, smack dab in the middle.

That's Curry Up Now for you.\n\nYelpers rave about the Chicken Tikka Masala (CTM) burrito, so I had to try one for myself. It's definitely worth $8.50 because the burrito is so HUGE that I can split it into two separate meals. Majority of the burrito contained rice, but I felt like there was still a good amount of chicken, so I didn't feel ripped off. The chicken was dry, but it was covered in a spicy, flavorful sauce that had just the right amount of heat.\n\nThe Kathi Roll with beef is a greasy greasy greasy mess! It's so damn oily that the oil leaked through the foil (which poorly wrapped the roll), soaking the paper bag and leaving a stain on my jeans that I can't remove. The beef was flavorful and juicy, and there were onions for some crunch. The ingredients were rolled up in an unevenly-distributed egg-washed flat bread that got soggy quickly. Overall, the kathi roll wasn't worth $6.50.\n\nThe Sexy Fries are oily as well, but not as bad as the kathi roll. For $8.50, you get sweet potato waffle fries topped with choice of meat, cheese, and onions. I opted for the chicken, which was disappointingly dry. The fries also got soggy pretty quickly.\n\nIf you can't handle spicy, skip Curry Up Now. Even their \"mild\" options have a kick to it.

I've eaten the Tikka Masala Burrito off the food truck on Bush and liked it enough to be curious about the popularity of this place. Jamie was willing to forgo Alhamra to come here, no small feat. The menu was fairly undecipherable at twenty paces with graphics that make it more challenging to read than an eye exam at the DMV.\n\nJamie surprisingly got all Hindu on me and ordered the $11 Eight Item Thali Platter, probably the most traditionally Indian dish on the menu. On a prison cafeteria tray was served parantha, garbanzo beans, pickles, papadum, rice and salad. He got two entrees to complete the tray, and Jamie selected the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Beef M.E.A.T. Stew. It was quite a potpourri of distinct flavors, a bit on the hit-and-miss side but exemplary in execution for a place fashioned after a street food cart. My order was more aligned with the food truck I knew as I started with the $11 Naughty Naan, which starts with a smaller piece of naan and tops it with tikka masala, cheese, greens, onions, shaved jalape\u00f1os and chunks of lamb (photo: http://bit.ly/147deAx).\n\nSure, it was delicious, but I doubt I would find something like this on the outskirts of Jodhpur. It was way too San Francisco-style gourmet to be found in a knapsnak carried by a camel in the desert. Even further afield from Rajasthan are the $8 Sexy Fries, a half-order of sweet potato fries dressed with cheese and onions and topped by, believe it or not, Pork Belly (photo: http://bit.ly/13hwg0O).

What a friggin' masterpiece. It's hella royal. I thought I was the only one who mixed chutneys with my curries. Indian restaurants often serve it with papadum, but I find I find myself just smothering it on my other food. Well, that's kind of what they did here. Well that's only part of it. There's a lot of other things going on in here and I suggest you try it\n\nAlso last time I went here I felt a bit daring and ordered spicy.

I tried picking up the burrito and it was squishing around in my hands - I couldn't even get a hold of it. Not pleasant. Then the masala sauce, which I'm used to being so amazing and flavorful, was watery, thin, and bland. I had to scoop some of the rice out because it was also watery and bland, no salt even.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-31", "description": "TL; DR version: I stopped by this food truck today, and the food was pure hell. Heck, if I was a suing man, I'd be suing them for damages.\n\nSo here's what happened. We ordered 2 \"hella vegan\" burritos. They have 3 levels of spices: \"medium\" (the default), \"spicy\" (which I guess is spicier), and the third, \"desi ('they-see') spicy\" which has a sauce made of ghost peppers and trinidad scorpio (sic) peppers.\n\nNow, i've tasted ghost pepper sauces; heck, I have Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce at home. It is *NOT* something to be trifled with; I avoid it unless I'm really, REALLY looking for pain. So, when ordering, I told the dude: \"I want it spicy, but NOT \"desi\" spicy! Are we clear?\" I must've repeated this 3 times, and he made sure that he understood it. In fact, he went so far as to say \"desi spicy\", and then corrected himself.\n\nWe take our HV burritos and head out to find a nice place to sit. First of all: the burritos are pre-made. So if you want to change the spiciness or alter an ingredient, they have to unwrap it, make the change, and wrap it back up. Anyone who has messed with a burrito knows that doing this, the end result is not the same. So the burritos we got were misshapen and loose. But never mind; a delicious Indian lunch beckoned. Or so i thought.\n\nAfter a few bites, I realized that the spice level was a bit too much. But I had explicitly told them not to make it \"desi spicy\", right? Repeatedly. So they couldn't have screwed it up; maybe the heat was just passing. \n\nNow, anyone who has had ghost pepper (or the hotter Trinidad Scorpion) knows that it doesn't burn you immediately, but the heat builds up; unlike, say, a habanero or a jalapeno, where you feel the heat immediately. And once the ghost pepper gets going, nothing can help you because it's inside you, burning its way out. It's like eating too much of a pot brownie (and it will make you hallucinate too).\n\nBut coming back to my tale. As I was finishing the burrito,  and as the heat continued to build up, it dawned on me that they had, in fact, given me the \"desi hot\" version. Fucking hell. Soon I was hyper-ventilating, and pacing back and forth as the fire radiated out from my belly, making me sweat like crazy. After dowsing it with water and Odwalla drinks, I was able to come back to my senses.\n\nHere's the thing: most other places will warn you if they're about to unleash this much carnage on your innards. But this place? No sir! What a bunch of idiots.  If they don't even know how to handle something so dangerous as ghost pepper sauce, how the heck are they in the food business??", "author": "A J."}

My co-worker and I arrived several minutes before the event started at 11:30 AM and luckily beat the lines. I ordered the much-hyped CTM Burrito ($7) and made it a Combo (Samosa and Mango Lassi) for an additional $4. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjuUljBC7tCMxX5eiWlzMA?select=XjPo2w0UmoKbaCmGnoGidg \n\nCC's are accepted. Since the CTM Burrito is pre-made, it only took 2 minutes to get my order. \n\nWhen I received my order, the fragrant curry aroma started to permeate through the brown bag and I couldn't wait to get back to the office so I can devour my meal.\n\nCTM BURRITO:\nTHE BEST AND MOST FLAVORUFL BURITTO I'VE EVER HAD!!! I'm not a huge fan of fusion cuisine because the authenticity of flavors seem to be water-downed in order appeal to the general public, but NOT in this case... \n\nWrapped in a soft tortilla, the chicken tikka masala was BURSTING with rich, bold flavors and spices! The tikka masala sauce was rich, creamy, tangy and savory with a hint of exotic sweetness from the coconut milk. The earthy spices of tumeric, coriander, cumin and cardamom really shined through and gave a great subtle punch while the cayenne pepper added enough heat to make my cheeks blush. The chunks of tender chicken (a tad dry though) and perfectly al-dente rice soaked and married with the tikka masala sauce making each bite of the CTM burrito extremely flavorful. The chana (chick peas) were tender, yet slightly crisp which gave the burrito a nice texture contrast. Each bite tantalized every one of my taste buds and sent me on a subliminal bliss. *Eyes roll back in the head*\n\nFyi, I forgot to order my burrito \"spicy\", but the regular gave this spicy food lover the right amount of fiery heat to set my mouth on a subtle fire. \n\nThe burrito was generously filled with the chicken tikka masala and rice so I was only able to eat half of the burrito before becoming stuffed. When I ate the remaining half for dinner 6 hours later, it held up very well as the tortilla was not soggy. \n\nSAMOSA:\nAlthough the skin was crunchy and crisp, I didn't care too much for the potato filling as it was bland and lacked the prominent curry spices. \n\nMANGO LASSI:\nThick, rich, creamy, sweet and tart, the yogurt and milk in Mango Lassi really help to sooth the heat from the burrito. However, it wasn't iced enough so it was almost lukewarm. \n\nI always end up disappointed with hyped up places, but Curry Up Now's CTM Burrito totally lived up to its hype and is now my FAVORITE food truck! There are very few life-changing foods in my book but the CTM burrito wins a place in mine and is definitely worthy to be on the 7x7 List.

As we drove up to the Centennial Towers, I announced, 'you know we're headed into someone's job just to eat, right?!' \n\nTechnically, it's the outdoor parking lot of someone's job, but still...the lengths I'll go to avoid traditional restaurant settings has reached epic proportions lately. Our warmish weather has made me weary of silverware, table cloths, & waiters. This parking lot was exactly what I was looking for! The intense 1pm sunshine made me thankful for my Neutrogena SPF 45.

It's really too bad that they don't have a Chicken and Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito.  That would so rock!\n\nToday was when they hit their highest note so far when I had their \"Almost Famous\" Torta with Chicken and a side of Sweet Potato Fries (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=20LLF81b6RWs81S0BcRw4g).  It was amazing!  Huge pieces of Marinated Chicken Breast, lettuce, tomato, and guacamole.  And then it comes with Sweet Potato Fries and you've got an awesome deal for $8.  It's really too bad they don't serve it all the time.\n\nNow I can really understand why the lines are always super long for Curry Up Now.  Their food is very filling and flavorful (when not super spicy) and they always have friendly service.  Plus, they serve Mexican Coke =)", "author": "Rodney H."}

The Sexy Fries were also quite good, but just reminded me of a Tikka Masala Burrito poured on top of criss-cut fries. Chunks of meat, fried potatoes, curry sauce, and possibly some cheese (?). It was good, but since it was so similar to the burrito, I would either get one or the other, not both. The Samosas were just okay in my book. I'm not usually a fan of potatoes, so since it was filled with diced potatoes, seasoned, and fried, I wasn't too imporessed. I took one bite and then passed on to the next item.\n\nEven though I was only really impressed by the burrito, it's soooo good that I still have to give this place five stars!

When I found out that Curry Up Now was on the OrderAheadApp I was thrilled! I thought, \"Awesome! Now I can order lunch for myself and the office and NOT have to wait in that crazy long line.. done deal.\" So, I placed my order at 10:10am for (6) chicken masala burritos, a free range chicken plate, (2) sexy  fries and a mango lassi for pick-up at 11:40am. I figured well over an hour and a half before the FiDi lunch rush would be ample time for that size of an order, right?\n\nWrong. \n\nI showed up at 11:45am and proceeded to the window to pick up the order and this is basically how it went down-\n\nMe: \"Hi, I'm here to pick up my OrderAhead order, under the name Cara\"\n\nGuy Behind Counter: \"Oh.. I haven't even checked my phone at all today (takes his phone out and opens up the app). Let me just check something, hang on a sec\"\n\nMe: ..........Okay........ (at this point, it was pretty evident that he was just now seeing my order for the first time)\n\nGBC: \"Ohh.. Cara. Okay, here's your order... Okay, it'll be just a few minutes. It's pretty slow right now so it shouldn't take too long\".\n\nMe: \"..........Okay.... No worries, I can wait, thanks.\"\n\n5 minutes later...\n\nGBC: \"Ohhhh.. actually we're all out of fries, so we can't make any of the sexy fries. How about we give you some Samosa's instead?\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, okay.. that should be fine, thank you.\"\n\n15 minutes go by.........\n\nGBC: \"Here's your order.. Sorry, we ran out of Samosa's too, but here's $8 back\". He frantically walks away and begins to help the rest of the folks in line. Um, yeah thanks guy. \n\nFirst off- if you're not going to check your online ordering app DAILY, then what's the point of even offering such a feature? \"You haven't checked you phone all day\"? More like, you're not doing you're damn job at all. I placed my order well in advanced and still had to wait another 20 minutes for my order; it completely defeated the whole purpose of \"ordering ahead\".  \n\nSecondly- everything was sloppily put together and not very appealing to the eye. A burrito should be neatly and tightly wrapped, not falling apart inside of the bag. I received a sad soggy container full of greasy paneer masala (sans fries) since they were out of fries. \n\nThird- if you're going to attempt any sort of apology for YOUR screw up, at least offer a better incentive rather than throwing a sad $8 my way. \n\nI really wanted to like this truck, since so many people have nothing but great things to say about their food, but unfortunately, this first experience may very well be my last.

The people in front got their burrito  within minutes of ordering so I knew mine would come out any second. Well 5 minutes went by. Ten burritos were made, but none of the ten people waiting got called. Those ten burritos were just put in a bag and set aside. Did people call in for to-go? Or was it catering? If it is, it seems a little unfair for the people waiting 30+ mins in line to get their food after.\n\nBy the time I got my burrito 45 minutes of my lunch break had past.

I don't consider myself an expert on Indian food, but I am an expert on what tastes good. The chicken bits were tender and well proportioned. The onions had a delightful crunch. The chick peas almost had a lovely potato-esque texture. And the sauce...oh the sauce. It is quite spicy, but rich in flavor. The tortilla itself was perfectly chewy as well. \n\nOnly thing was that the wait was a little jarring. Plus some of the orders were given out of order, which definitely annoyed a number of customers, including myself. But it was ultimately worth it. Just be sure to have some water with you for that fiery masala! Muy caliente!", "author": "Kero D."}

Let's specifically talk about those fusion burritos. Curry Up Now serves this thing called a Chicken Tikka Masala burrito. It is delicious! I love the spicy sauce, yum yum yum. All that goodness wrapped up, without ever needing a utensil. It's 8 dollars, and they accept credit card--which is totally awesome for a food truck. You instantly get your burrito when you order, so that's awesome. My friend ordered the Sexy Fries, and mmmhmm they looked enticing. Maybe next time.\n\nTip #1: you might want to order ahead of time because the line is long!\nTip #2: bring a drink/water or buy at the truck.

I miss peering off the building's balcony to see if the truck arrived and being one of the first in line. Now that I'm back in the South Bay, it's too bad that CUN is a rarity in the South Bay. But when this beautiful yellow food truck does roll into San Jose, at least there aren't 45-minute lunch waits like there are in the FiDi.\n\nHere's the breakdown...\n\n- Tikka masala burrito: The chicken in the chicken TMB is too dry for my liking and the onions have that raw onion taste because they're are cut a tad too big and/or not cooked long enough. For those reasons, I always go for the paneer TMB. The TMB is way better than some non-Indian burritos out there. Solid.\n\n- Deconstructed samosa: Almost as big as a baby's head. Serious.\n\n- Sexy fries: Criss-cut sweet potato fries lovingly smothered with your choice of chicken or paneer tikka masala, then sprinkled with melted shredded cheese. What a way to one-up chili cheese fries. Damn.\n\n- Mango lassi: I'm no lassi expert so I can't comment on it's authenticity or whether it's the best lassi ever. I will say that the mango lassi pairs is a great counterpart to the spices found in the food. Mmm.\n\nC U sooN, CUN!", "author": "Sylvia D."}

The name alone of sexy fries was really appealing, so I went for it. Being a natural carnivore, I naturally went for the CTM (the chicken one lol). When I got them, came in a standard food truck looking to-go box. When I opened the box, the goody goodness came.\n\nThe CTM Sexy Fries are actually waffle fries covered in curry sauced chicken. The portion was pretty good too. This alone was filling, killing my interest to check out other trucks (a good thing, haha). The spices were pretty good, I've always been a fan of indian food.

I've always have a passion for Indian food. I love heavily spiced food with great seasoning and flavors! The smell of cumin and curry powder just makes me so happy! I ordered the chicken tikka masala Burrito - oh em gee, I loved it! The chicken was marinated deep in the flavorful curry, it was so tender and perfectly seasoned! The rice and a bit of beans makes it very filling. The onions in the burrito gives it a little texture, it also brings out the flavor of the chicken! It is a big size burrito, $8 and you will feel so full after! The reg burrito has a bit of a kick at the end. It's doable for people who don't normally eat spicy food. So one time i ordered the super spicy (ghost pepper infused) burrito - I cried, the tears of joy! I sweated, the sweat came from the heat of the pepper! and I LOVED IT!\n\nDeconstructed samosa - inside out samosa is delicious, also! that's my other favorite!

The key with food trucks is preparing the food in convenient, on-the-go style options. The folks at Curry Up Now solved this by putting traditional Indian dishes in a tortilla and wrapping them up into a delicious burrito. We both got the Chicken Tikka Masala (with organic chicken breast from Fulton Valley Farms), and I also got a thick Mango Lassi to help wash it down and calm the spiciness of the burrito.\n\nMy combo also came with a Samosa, which was equally tasty. However, for some reason, I thought this meant their famous \"deconstructed samosa,\" which is basically an inside-out version. I will definitely be trying that next time!

While many of the ideas, such as a chicken tikka masala burrito, should work, the result here is a little bit of both and not enough of either.  The chicken  itself seemed dry and bland (!) to me, the rice merely emphasizing that.  The only thing burrito about it was the admittedly nice tortilla.  In other words, the concept should go further with some of the Indian garnishes and sauces in the burrito itself.\n\nOddly, the paneer tikka masala burrito is better, even though the only change is the protein.  The paneer itself is pretty good - nice, big, squeaky cubes, which is how I like it.  \n\nThe kati rolls are probably the best item on the menu, but you'd need to order two (or a samosa or fries) to make a lunch, which would be true pretty much anywhere.  But unlike other venues, your choices are limited to chicken, paneer or vegan.\n\nThe least successful menu items (again, to me) are the sexy fries and the deconstructed samosas.  They are essentially variations on other dishes (kinda like how Chipotle has basically one dish that gets recycled into other shapes), and the substitution of fries, for example, doesn't add a whole lot, plus they get unpleasantly soggy under the toppings.  And samosas are just fine the way they are; no deconstruction warranted.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

Unfortunately they have stopped visiting, likely because the buzz of Off the Grid has died down and local restaurants have been complaining of the excessive competition Off the Grid forces. However, this summer I will definitely be visiting the city to get my fix of Curry Up Now! \n\nService: It's a food truck so the food comes out pretty quickly. The longest I've had to wait is 5 minutes and that's if they're making a burrito in the case that it is not already made. The guy that I have interacted with everytime is very nice and always gives me extra chutney (the red and green sauces) when I ask. \n\nFood: My absolutely favorite dish is the paneer tikka masala (PTM) Burrito. It is a burrito filled with rice, paneer tikka masala (an indian curry with paneer and a creamy tomato gravy), and chutneys. It reminds me of Indian Chipotle. What I love is that is the PTM is not so creamy that it makes the burrito too heavy or messy to eat. It's just liquid enough so your burrito is not that dry but not too much so it's a hassle to eat. It's a good level of spicy too, so you really taste all the flavors that come along with the PTM, even though the rice and burrito act against them. Ugh, I can go on and on about how good this burrito is. For $8 at a foodtruck, totally worth it! The burrito is huge and after I scarf it down, I am extremely satisfied and full. The other dish that I have tried and also really enjoyed are the sexy fries. I usually get the PTM Sexy Fries, which is basically big potato wedges doused with PTM and chutneys. The potato wedges are cooked just right and with the paneer and chutneys, this is a great snack! \n\nVerdict: I miss this food truck so much and wish it would come back to Berkeley!

Despite the fact that the menu had written \"rolls\" (plural) it was really just one big roll (was expecting multiple tiny rolls, like an Indian Spring Roll type deal). It was pretty good but nothing memorable. \n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala Burrito was pretty good. It was Chicken Tikka Masala, rice and beans. Kind if boring after couple of bites. When ordering an $8 buritto I kind of expect a little more layering. Definately needed some acidity (like maybe a pico de gayo or tomato chutney) in the burrito. It is definately big, got 3 meals out of it. After I took it home I broke open the tortilla, chopped the chicken up (was a little too chunky for me, would have better if shredded or had just smaller pieces), added tomatoes and cheese and it was a million times better.\n\nOverall this was just an okay experience. Didn't really live up to the hype, that could be because I have one of the best Indian Fusion restaurants 2 minutes from my Boyfriends house (Pizza and Curry) and kind of compare to them a lot.\n\nANYWAYS,  I would probably rather try a new truck before coming here again.

It is a thriving hub, a gathering point of interest for all who desire a cheap, quick and comparatively delicious lunch. I remember spending much of my off campus high school lunches loitering around my local burrito truck, taking in all that community, oh yeah and all that grease and indigestion.\n\nFast forward to present. I am now a non-loitering working man in the heart of the Financial District in San Francisco. I spend much of my lunches not loitering, but still desirous of a quick, delicious and comparatively cheap lunch. \n\nI read about the Curry Up Now burrito truck in one of my favorite San Francisco food blogs, SF Foodie. I've always had a fondness for Indian food, but wrap that up in burrito?! Ingenious. Is it possible to take something so delicious and re-invent it in a way that is different but does not take away from the tradition of Indian cuisine? The answer is a resounding yes.\n\nI ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala burrito, Desi spicy, via their online ordering system. When you go to the truck there are 2 lines, one for people who ordered online and one for people who didn't. \n\nWhen I took my first bite of my tikka masala burrito, I was overwhelmed by the creaminess and the burst of spices. The burrito is incredibly flavorful. But then it hit. This burrito is insanely spicy! If I could put the word \"spicy\" in all caps, then bold it, then change the color to flaming hot red and then change the font size to 57 I would. That's the only way to describe the inferno that ignited in the pit of my stomach. Goodness gracious. It was painful to finish the rest of this burrito, but I am not one to let food go to waste. Every remaining bite was painful. The heat of the burrito unfortunately took away from the delicious initial taste of the tikka masala.\n\nIf you are a lover of spicy food (or a sadist) go Desi spicy. If not then go (a lot) milder. Be sure to pair this food with your favorite dairy product (maybe 2 or 3 of them) because I guarantee you will need something to douse the fire burning on the dance floor located in the bottom of your stomach word to Sean Kingston.", "author": "Allan Y."}

Ah, well, it was the end of their biz day so gave 'em the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA week later I went again; it was raining heavily, but despite this the line was not only long - it wasn't moving at all. Like, literally. In the 10 minutes I clocked, the line literally did not move one foot forward. Perhaps this was due to a large party changing their minds or being clueless, or... perhaps this has to do with some of the new faces I'm seeing in the truck. I walked away after allowing 10 minutes to pass with zero sign of getting an inch closer.\n\nAnd then a few days later I go to try them *again*...\n\nSo there's a new young dude who works this truck that has a serious attitude problem. Not only does he not acknowledge you with eye contact or reply to \"thank you,\" he actually looks like he's contemptuous of you for eating there. WTF?! This turkey slapped my food in my hand like I was wearing on his last nerve, but... I hadn't even said anything (having dealt with a different cashier at the order window.)\n\nSo I go once more the next week - yes, I'm a glutton for punishment AND paneer burritos - trying not to think that this succession of completely disappointing visits was, perhaps, the universe trying to tell me something. He was there again. It proved to be the final straw. So so rude, surly... Mission accomplished dude: I don't want to see you again either.\n\nSorry CurryUpNow. I know finding decent employees is tough these days but you can do better than this kid. The equation is something like Quality, Service, Price. You used to have Quality nailed and Service was acceptable, cuz ya sure ain't cheap. 1 out of 3 doesn't cut it usually. You've lost me for now.\n\nGuess I'll have to learn to make my own lunches, like I've been threatening to do for so long...\n_______________________\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nThe PTM burrito is a flavor bomb. It is crack in a tortilla. It is the sole reason I don't dread lunchtime any more, even though I only get one a week usually... because just knowing it's an option makes me feel existentially better.

(The national dish of Britain lends itself perfectly to the burrito format. It's a wonder why no one thought of this sooner!) Loaded with spices, it was incredibly flavourful and one of the better tikka masalas I've had. The cubed chicken pieces--which they don't skimp on--were tender, the basmati rice was seasoned well, and there was just the perfect amount of tikka masala sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjuUljBC7tCMxX5eiWlzMA?select=PIYg5NTkZ4tQW7ioN2ELJw). I also liked the soft crunch from the sweet aromatic onions. Wrapping all that deliciousness up in a flour tortilla only made everything even better. Plus, all the ingredients were evenly distributed so I got a little bit of everything in every bite--an important feature in any good burrito!\n \nI also got a veggie samosa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjuUljBC7tCMxX5eiWlzMA?select=6tM8jo4Y6h4bYYeNrWq-3Q) and that was pretty good too. It was big and filled with potatoes, peas, and lots of spices. But compared to the burrito, this was nothing special since you can find good samosas in most Indian eateries.\n \nI liked the Indian chips they sell off the side of the truck too--very unique flavours!\n \nCurry Up Now has the best of both worlds--all the flavour you'd get at an Indian restaurant without the lingering curry smell in your clothes, hair, and pores.

The chicken tikka masala was no exception.  You can hold the whole meal in one hand with rice, chicken, lentils, and bell peppers.  As for the spice level, I could taste the spice but it was definitely bearable.\n\nWhen I ordered this, the guy at the window said \"finally\", probably indicating that multiples before me all stuck with the paneer tikka masala.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm addicted; I must have it at least once a week or I get sluggish and combative. The concept is pure genius; Indian food encapsulated in burrito form. Two of my favorite foods, together. \n\nSome of the reviewers complain about the lines, and that's a legitimate frustration. But the line isn't because of a lackadaisical team inside the truck. It's because this food is really effing good, and people line up in the rain for 20 minutes for it. I'm not exaggerating; last week a group of about 10 of us were huddled in the Wells Fargo ATM shelter in heavy rain, waiting for the truck to show up. And nobody complained; the line had the same friendly buzz as a bunch of hippies waiting in line for Phish tickets. \n\nAs for the comments that it's spicy; it's not for the fainthearted. But the spice is very different from those hot sauces you buy at the Dallas airport that are hot just for the sake of being able to say \"butt burner!\" on the label. Curry Up Now's food has so much flavor that the spice isn't overpowering or gratuitous; it complements the food. And after a few bites you hardly notice the heat. \n\nPortions are generous without being ridiculous; it's a good value. The special burritos are always a hit, in addition to the standard Tikka Masala burrito. \n\nSo to sum up; this place is awful and you shouldn't go.

Our timings just kept clashing so much that the urge went from the shrill screams reminiscent of a toddler's tantrum to a more passive quiet murmur in the back of my mind... \n\nTwo days ago, (somewhat) serendipitously, we crossed paths.\n\nI ordered a mango lassi and a spicy chicken tikka masala burrito while my friend had the regular. They weren't as good as the burritos we used to make at home with leftover Indian food or my Mom's curry+daal + a little rice, and sometimes egg - but that's a pretty high (and unrealistic) bar. My Mom's curry is delicious.\n\nKeeping in mind that Curry Up Now prepares everything in a small mobile kitchen, their burrito provides a unique & tasty option for take-out. Although, I must add, some bites definitely had more flavor than others. Those bites in particular were 5*-worthy, while others only 3*. (Hence the 4 star review.) I could've done with just a little less rice or a little more chicken tikka masala - but that's just me. My friend (who doesn't ordinarily prefer Indian food) loved it just the way it was. Their mango lassi seems rather diluted but has quite a kick due to the extra mint leaves as well as the lassi's acidity (which I like). However, it coming from a truck meant warmer than optimal temperature. Still, it's good overall if only flavor-wise.\n\nThe lines are long, so be prepared to wait a while. They've got a limited space for a few condiments right above the drinks, where you can find raita, achar, and whole jalapenos. If you want hot sauce, grab one of those little plastic containers and pass it to the person handing you your order so they can serve you some.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try some of the other items on their menu and am especially curious about their kathi rolls, deconstructed samosas, & desi donuts.", "author": "Asha S."}

We got two chicken tikka masala burritos and one chicken deconstructed samosa. FYI, they DO accept credit cards.\n\nThe deconstructed chicken samosa was delicious! The samosa was bathed in a savory chutney that had onions, tomatoes, and garbanzo beans. They drizzled the sweet tamarind sauce as well as the green herb sauce traditionally eaten with samosa into the chutney. Spices were wonderful, though the samosa turned mushy because of the chutney. They went a little overboard with the garbanzo beans and by the end I was eating spoonfuls of beans.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala burrito totally lives up to its reputation. One bite and I was smitten. It was a decent size for $7. The chicken was cooked well and the spices were right on.\n\nThey had a white sauce that I guess was made from yogurt from the consistency and taste. Tasted good with the burrito and samosa.

Love the fact that you can order  online (without committing a  prepayment) before 10:45AM to pick up your food at noon.  Bypassing all those hungry office workers (desi and non-desi) feels better than skipping past a velvet rope!!!  The burrito is a meal and a half, so you might be best with a ThumsUp instead of a more pedestrian samosa.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala Burrito (Desi Hot): Watch out Mexico, your burritos are becoming irrelevant!  Chick peas instead of refried beans or black beans.  Spicy methi pulao instead of yellow rice.  Cliantro mint chutney instead of salsa.  Tender tandoori tikka chicken instead of the flavorless pollo asado.  And for once, hot means HOT!  The whole experience is like eating a spicy chicken biryani in a tortilla wrap which makes it portable and adds a good chewy texture.  Love the crunchy, slightly pickled onions because all the other spices must not have been enough alone to enhance your post-burrito breath!  Much more flavor complexity than any Mexican burrito I've ever had.\n\nPaneer Tikka Masala Burrito (Desi Hot): All the goodness of the chicken burrito, but with cheesy goodness instead.  The paneer was the right texture, chewy and slightly dry like homemade (as opposed to that bad store bought stuff).  Wish they would have seared it a bit though to add a crunch.\n\nSamosa: Got this as a $1.50 combo upgrade with my burrito.  Not overly greasy, but too salty.  Also a bit bland.

I'm pretty sure thinking about curry all day and getting on the subway a few times a week to hit the Bush truck for lunch merits \"obsessed.\"  \n\nI love this truck so much.  People seem to have a low tolerance for spiciness--I'm not judging, just noting--because I would describe the spice level \"moderate.\"  It makes my nose run a bit but it's not FIRE IN MY MOUTH status at all.  More importantly, their food is delicious.  \n\nHere are the things I eat at least three times per week:\n\nTikka Masala Burrito: the crown jewel of Curry Up Now, this thing comes packed with your chosen meat or cheese tikka masala, pickled onions (I love these things and could eat them on their own, breath be damned), rice, and some garbanzo action.  It's amazingly, magically delicious, and it's $8 for at least two meals (I'm an average-sized female so maybe one meal for you burly men or 4 meals for you waify supermodels).\n\nDeconstructed samosa: This stroke of genius is a smashed samosa topped with garbanzo action, chutneys, and your chosen meat.  It's savory and has more flavor than the burrito.  It's the food snob choice, but I'm often lured back to the burrito when I need more of a curry kick.  The decon isn't actually curry, contrary to popular belief.  ...I'm not sure that's true since the definition of curry seems to be \"some spices together\" but it's definitely not tikka masala as in the burrito.  \n\nBOTH OF THESE ITEMS ARE AMAZING.*  I really can't overstate this.  I've had a ton of Indian food from all sorts of places, but I'm in no way an expert, so I'm not going to compare CUN to Indian food as a whole.  I have no idea how authentic it is, nor do I care.  Curry Up Now does not speak for all of Indian cuisine.  It speaks for all of delicious cuisine.  Try it, love it, go back, borrow your friend's car to go to the restaurant, suffer dreams about it, call in sick to a meeting so you can curry up, force your spice-hating friends to love it, become That Person who just talks about curry all the time...\n\nMaybe it's actually a life ruiner, now that I think about it.  Avoid it at all costs.  At the very least, it'll ruin your local sandwich shop for you.  More curry for me.\n\n*Other menu items are delicious as well--I just consider these two the stars of the menu.

The crispy breading is of course the best part of any samosa, and it makes an appearance in the center of the deconstructed version. The filling is a great mixture of beans, potatoes, and spices (it's quite spicy!) In total, it's significantly larger than a \"constructed\" samosa; it's a small meal in and of itself.\n\nToday I ordered a regular samosa and a Chicken Vindaloo burrito. The samosa wasn't nearly as good as the deconstructed version, but hey, it's hard to go wrong with spicy potatoes in a deep fried batter. \n\nThe Chicken Vindaloo burrito was fantastic. It was huge; I definitely didn't need the extra samosa. It also happened to be extremely tasty. Well spiced, well cooked chicken (I didn't think it was too dry as others have said), and great rice and beans. It was pretty spicy, so get something else if that's an issue for you.\n\nAs an added bonus for capsaicin-o-philes like me are the spiced chiles they offer as condiments.

I took my chances today without cash, hoping I could use a credit card.  The cashier didn't know how to log into the iPhone credit card app and tried calling her boss numerous times to get the pin code to log in.  It sounded like her boss didn't have a clue either, so the cook joined the party and tried saving the day.  She did this with a few people patiently waiting for their food in the Brisbane breeze (there was only one cook at that time).  This circus went on for 10 long minutes, until they finally got into the app somehow.  My credit card was accepted, which prompted others in line to take theirs out, only to be promptly told NO credit cards after me.  You can just imagine the confusion among everyone right now.  It was kind of hilarious.  Some people stayed in line, looking confused, and others threw in the towel and left.\n\nIt took another 10 minutes for the cook to realize she couldn't successfully log into the app either and that there were lots of people waiting for their food.

Kathi roll's USP is that its made with wheat flour indian-style bread.\n\nGoat Curry: Smelled sooooo good, tasted totally opposite. Just a combination of garam masala and goat. No taste.\n\nChicken Burrito: Too saucy and again no taste to it.\n\nI wish the owners of Curry Up Now soon realize that they are losing the Indian taste from their menu each day.

My boyfriend had never been to OTG before, so we walked around and skimmed the menus of each truck.  \n\nI was in an indecisive mood, but we came to the conclusion that Curry Up Now's tikka masala burrito would be the most delicious option.  I'm usually one who likes to try new things, but based on how much I liked the burrito last time, I knew that my boyfriend would like it and he thought it sounded really good too.  We got in line, which was once again, really quick and within minutes, a hot, wrapped, huge tikka masala burrito was in front of us.  (It was large enough for the two of us to share).  \n\nThe burrito ($8) had many pieces of chicken and was so flavorful.  The tikka masala is spicy enough without being overpowering.  They also have a wonderful tangy yogurt sauce which compliments the burrito quite nicely. The burrito is wrapped nicely so that it doesn't fall apart or get sloppy- even when you're down to the last few bites.  With this last visit, I have to bump Curry Up Now to five stars-because it really is as good as it gets.

So is this truck and its goods - they're insane....ly great.\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, they recently introduced spicy levels for their burritos, in case you couldn't stand the default (spicy). But really, mild? Mild is for chickens. At spicy, the paneer tikka masala burrito is so hot, your lips will burn at even the slightest touch of the sauce they put in it. I, being masochistic when it comes to spicy foods, even dripped a few drops of their excellent hot sauce into the fiery pit of paneer, and spent my lunch hours crying in tears of joy (and pain).\n\nLines can get long, so I highly recommend ordering with their mobile app, then picking it up.\n\nYou can order a deconstructed samosa too, if you wish. I've heard good things about it. But my heart will always burn for the burritos. And I do mean \"burn\".", "author": "Hannah H."}

He probably went to Curry Up Now for lunch.  \n\nIf you love spicy arse curry and organic chicken rolled up in a giant tortilla, look no further than the chicken tikki masala burrito.  Especially if you love extra hot/spicy stuff.  I will say the ratio of chicken to rice is a hit or miss w/ this truck...and that's why I only give it 4 stars instead of 5.  I've had one w/ way too much rice and barely any chicken and another w/ very little rice and a huge portion of chicken (obviously preferred).  But for $7.50, you can't really go wrong w/ giving this place a shot.  The spicy curry mixed w/ organic chicken is fantastic..no doubt you'll feel the burn in your tummy and bowels.

I ran over at 11:30 and didn't have to deal with a line. I had the choice of a tikka burrito or a pulled apart samosa. I went for the burrito because they had my favorite - paneer. Paneer is a fried cheese that looks like tofu, but isn't. I brought it back to my desk, it was a huge piece of work. Definitely not like the typical burrito you can eat and walk with, you definitely need to sit down with a knife and fork.. or be willing to get your hands curried up. \n\nI did enjoy my burrito, it had some rice, paneer and garbanzo beans in a mild curry. I could tell the spices were thrown in near the end of cooking which is one of my pet peeves with Indian food. I want to taste my garam masala cooked in, not thrown on later. There was a lot of garbanzo beans and not enough paneer or rice. And though I liked the paneer, it wasn't as good as some of the stuff I've had.\n\nThat said, I'll probably go back to try the samosa one of these days.", "author": "Analisa S."}

Well, I actually cut it into two halves and had half of it only since it was sooo big (definitely share the burrito especially if you are at OTG and need to save room for other treats).  Anyway, the burrito was still delicious the next day.\n\nThe burrito is basically just tortilla wrap filled with chicken tikka masala and rice.  What makes it so special you ask?  I think it's just because the tikka masala is so flavorful with the perfect blend of spices.  Also, since they don't have different condiments that usual burritos offer, they are able to make their burritos ahead of time, essentially eliminating the wait time that most other food trucks have.\n\nIf you've read my reviews before, you'll know that I love spicy foods.  My boss had told me how spicy their burritos are and boy are they spicy.  I got the regular (meaning I did not ask for extra spicy) and it had a very good kick to it.

Curry Up Now shocks and amazes each customer with an array of Indian fare that, when stacked up against other Bay Area competitors, stands head and shoulders above the rest. Each dish is prepared with care and a sheer love for food, a combination that must go with each and every restaurant in order to guarantee it's success. Curry Up Now shows just how good a food truck can be, and exemplifies how Indian street fare still has it's place in every person's modern tuned palate.\n\nThe example I choose to use is the Tikka Masala burrito, a strange yet quite effective method which combines traditional Indian cooking techniques and spices with the ever-popular Mexican fusion spin. Stuffed inside a delicious, warm tortilla rests piles of white rice turned curry yellow from the meat resting overtop. The juices and sauces seep into the rice, turning it into a medley of flavors that explode inside your mouth before ever tasting a bite of the meat itself. Once the meat is added to the mix, though, the level is turned up with the textures and added flavors of the protein melding with the already present rice and curry slurry.\n\nIf this has not convinced you of Curry Up Now's prowess, just give them a try for yourself. Their San Francisco based truck and fixed San Mateo location are waiting for your visit - and for your approval. I mean, after all, how could you fail such promising company.

For $7.50 you get one big burrito that for me lasts about 2 meals. When I first tried Curry Up Now the spice level was way over the top, like my lips are majorly burning and \"I need milk badly\" status. Fortunately, I think they realized the California crowd can not handle such heat so the regular spice has been toned down. And thank goodness because the burritos are so good that upon getting it from the truck all I want to do is scarf it down and before when it was so hot I just couldn't do it. But enough of my weak sauce status. The burritos are great. They're filled with spiced rice, tikka masala sauce, chicken (or paneer), and garbanzo beans. The seasoning is just right, and the tikka masala is the perfect balance of salty with sweetness. There's a decent helping of meat inside and is not overloaded with garbanzo beans, I would say they do a pretty good job of mixing it all around because every bite has a little of everything. The tortilla's they use are great and sturdy too so you're not dealing with a messy deconstructed burrito when you're taking it on the go. So good, have indulged in this probably more than 3 times.\n\nX-tra Special: Tikka Masala Fries! This combo kicks animal style fries and carne asada fries butts. Surprisingly delicious! The order is $7.50, could easily be your entree, no way you could eat this AND a burrito - and has waffle cut sweet potato fries topped with cheese, chicken, tikka masala, and fresh onions. My order was smothered in sauce, the fries were almost unidentifiable. The tikka masala was slightly different than what you get in the burrito, I would say a tad sweeter, and the sweet potato fries add a little extra. While I liked the smothered sauce I kind of wish the fries had been on top or something so that they would have stayed crispier. They're all the rave, give it a shot yourself.", "author": "Nicole L."}

I may have saved time by ordering online, but probably not much.  \n\nI'm pretty sure I smelled the truck before I saw it.  There was a huge crowd surrounding the truck- at least 25 people all waiting just to order, and maybe another 8 waiting to pick up their online orders.  Even though I ordered online, we still waited forever for our food.  They don't really make the online orders until you get there.  There was no official line really, just gotta shove your way up there and hope to get their attention.  Service is slow because there are only three people working in the truck and really, no more than three can fit and they are mighty busy.  \n\nBe patient, because the wait sure pays off!  My Deconstructed Samosa with chicken was delish!  For just five bucks, I got the perfect amount of fiberlicious food for me to eat.  It was spicy but I didn't order the ultra hot.  I mean I still wanted to make it back to the office.  But even the medium was so spicy I swear steam was coming off my glasses.  Okay so it was kind of hot outside and I sat in the sun, but still.  My coworker ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala burrito.  It was so hot she couldn't eat it at all, so I let her have it, er some of mine, that is.

It was also VERY SPICY - even for me and that says a lot, because I am a hot sauce whore and I pack it on! No need to here - it was already in the mix. Hot hot heat, like the kind that makes you start sniffling (as to whether that's good or bad, you be the judge!)\n\nI appreciated the fact that the filling was wrapped in a flour tortilla rather than a piece of naan, making an already heavy meal slightly less filling (I have had other tandoori wraps elsewhere, and they always tend to use naan). I found the menu to be humorous - as a vegetarian - they referred to the veggie options as \"om\" and the meat ones as \"un-om\" or \"not-om\" or something. \n\nDefinitely a two meal deal for me ($7).

I finished 4 cups of water while eating this thing. I should've ordered the lassi to soothe some of this heat. Maybe next time. And there will be a next time.\n\nDo not order the SCTMB if you cannot hang with spicy.\n\nI can't resist quoting Apu from the Simpsons: \"Good rice, good curry, good Gandhi, let's hurry.\"", "author": "LM M."}

I was hoping they would have the nice food truck mounted with CUN logo but we go the white truck instead. \n\nIt was about a 15 minutes wait in line.\n\nThe menu is pretty straight forward but for someone who has never tried Indian food, it might take some time asking what certain items on the menu were. \n\nI ordered Paneer (cheese) burrito as well as the Chicken Tikka Masala burrito. I tried the Samosa and I thought it was just okay.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala burrito was my favorite. It was $7 and quite filling. \n\nI have to say I LOVE the GARLIC ACHAAR (pickle).  I am in the process of finding a menu to make it.  Love the flavor of the paste and the tiny bite of the onion.\n\nAs always, I had the preconception that it would be hard to find parking but it wasn't. It was right on the parking lot with plenty of space.  It was hidden so you have to follow them on twitter of facebook to track the truck down.", "author": "Jboogie L."}

I've read some great reviews about the chicken tikka masala burrito and I just had to try it for myself.  And just like some other reviewers mentioned, the chicken itself was kinda dry but the curry flavoring more than makes up for it.  And even though the chicken was dry, the burrito as a whole was not.  Does that make sense?  I also enjoyed the samosas.  They counteracted the spiciness of the burrito perfectly.  I don't really do spicy so I'm glad I got the samosas.  So here's my verdict:  the burrito was flavorful and juicy enough to enjoy.  But if I didn't get the samosas, I think it would have eventually gotten too spicy for me.  And speaking of, when I asked the guy if there was a mild option, dude kinda yelled at me:  \"There's only MEDIUM and MORE SPICY!  That's it!\"  I was a little shocked that he seemed so annoyed.

Maybe  a baked/broiled pressed pork belly.  You can even turn it into a hash, and then drizzle the curry sauce on top.  You can stew any cut of pork to make it fall off the bone tender.

But now I'm back (back again), and ready to rock n' roll with this superstar review for Curry Up Now.\n\nAs you all now by now, C.U.N. is actually a food truck and not a restaurant.  So the menu choices are fairly limited, but from what I've seen today, you do get some delicious grub, and a fairly large portion, too.  For $12, I got the chicken tikka masala burrito, one samosa, and a mango lassi.  And I was impressed with all of them!  The samosa was fresh, crispy on the outside and all sorts of deliciousness on the inside.  The burrito itself was HUGE, had good flavor and a good ratio of rice to chicken.  I don't know who came up with the concept of tikka masala burrito, but that person was a freakin' genius!  Let's get them a Nobel prize already!  I know that there are a lot of food trucks and a handful of restaurants that do this kind of fusion burrito already (see Sushirrito for just one example), but not all of them do it right, and Curry Up Now definitely does it right.  Lastly, the mango lassi was just what the spice doctor ordered to wash down the fire in your mouth (both the samosa and the burrito had a good kick to them), and quell your sweet cravings. So that lassi actually does double-duty, and as someone who works in the pressure-cooker world of litigation, I appreciate a good multi-tasker. \n\nAhhh, I can feel the food coma coming on in 10, 9, 8, ...", "author": "Meg P."}

This was a mistake. A big fat mistake.\n\nI'd heard of Curry Up Now before and wanted to try their burritos. The problem was they're mostly based in the South Bay so I never had an opportunity.\n\nSo we went a little early, before they opened, and waited in the long line. You could order online and get your food early, too, but we didn't do that. Not that it would have made a difference.\n\nProblem 1: They didn't open on time.\nProblem 2: The line split into two. The express burrito line and the other line. \"Are there two lines? What? Which one are we in?\" Then, the idiocy of the lines. You could order a burrito in both lines and it doesn't matter if you ordered yours first. The burrito line gets it. I understand that line is meant to get their burritos faster, but seriously? I order my burrito way before someone else and they get theirs like 30 minutes before I do?\nProblem 3: Those people who ordered early online? They still had to stand in line. It's great they still want to make the food fresh for those customers, but had I ordered early, and still needed to wait in line, and then had to wait for my food to be made... I'd be beyond pissed.\nProblem 4: The guy taking orders? Oy vey. When we finally got to order, he took the order, looked toward the guys making the food, slowly made his way over to their wall, found a place to post it, then made his way back. He did this every. time. Every time.\nProblem 5: Took forever to get our food after ordering. Like half an hour. This is after over an hour of waiting in line. I walked away, bought some kim bap from John's Snack and Deli, and shared it with my coworker as we waited for our truck food.\n\nSo disorganized. To the power of 10. It's not like they haven't been operating for a while.\n\n... Anyhow, the food.\n\nI liked my chicken tikka masala burrito. It was good. There are chickpeas instead of beans. That's cool, it's not like a regular burrito just with Indian flavors. Everything about it is Indian except for the tortilla. I'd eat it again.\n\nBut after a wait like that, did it rock my world? Hell to the no!\n\nMy coworkers and I have not yet returned. Would I go back? Eeeh... yeah, I would. The publicity did not help their service, and hopefully they've improved their system.

Although I love my Oakland taco trucks, the idea of having any other food from a truck was kind of a surprise to me. (Aside from Kara's Kupcakes)\n\nToday I decided to give it a shot. So I walked over to the truck on my lunch, which took me about 5-7 minutes... I work over by the Embarcadero Centers and from the distance I was really hoping the walk wasn't for nothing. The line was fairly long as I approached the truck, so I thought damn! I'm going to be late going back to work. The line went by SO FAST! I was shocked! When I ordered my DECONSTRUCTED SAMOSA W/ CHICKEN it was ready in 2.5 seconds (literally). I got to the office and tried my new finding, and wa-la!!!

The Chicken Tiki Masala Burrito and Chicken Deconstructed Samosa were my favorites. The burrito had a lot of spices and beware, if you order spicy, dude no joke it's pretty spicy! I have a tolerance for spicy foods, but I could feel it burning going down. You'll need to get the Lassi like we did to sooth down the burning sensation. It was so much better spicy though, so if you can take the heat, order spicy! The deconstructed samosa had a lot of spice as well and even though we ordered spicy, our tongues weren't on fire like the burrito, it was actually the perfect level of spiciness. It had a wee bit too many garbanzo beans though. The samosa didn't impress us though, stuffed with too much potatoes and didn't come with the mint sauce that I usually like to top it off with.

There was a long line, but I had a long lunch so I got in it. The line moved so quickly, and I ordered a paneer tiki burrito. To my surprise, he gave it to me right away! That was SUCH a quick food truck experience, which is great for people with only a short lunch break. I also got the mango lassi, because people were raving about it. I didn't hate the lassi, but I didn't really like it either. I've had a ton of lassis, and this one just tasted..different. Definitely try it, because since it doesn't taste like a regular one, you might enjoy it. The burrito is mostly rice and sauce. It's very messy, so watch out, don't wear your nice clothes lol. The paneer was very fresh and fluffy tasting. The burrito wrap was just a regular burrito wrap and the sauce was just ok. Way too much sauce and rice. Once again, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good, and I got a tummy ache. After eating the burrito and for the rest of the day and night, I felt sickish from it, so I wouldn't go again. On the other hand, someone in the class I was taking had this place twice in a row and still loved it, so it's all a matter of taste and diet I guess. I think I'll stick to yummy Kasa for street Indian food.  Oh, and ps, it wasn't spicy in the slightest bit.

I checked the website to see if they would be in the FiDi today and alas, the stars were aligned.  I went to the order section of the site and tried to place my order.  After timing out several times, I called to find out if there was an issue. I was told by a very nice and accommodating man that they were trying to revamp the website.  He offered to take my order by phone and text it to the truck--hooray\n\nWhen I arrived at 11:40, I was the 4th person in line with the doors of the truck closed and the staff working furiously.  The truck didn't quite open on time and the menu that stated \"Sold Out\" was quickly altered with a Sharpie  \"CTM and PTM\"  (Chicken Tikka Masala burrito and Paneer Tikka masala burrito).  \n\nMy yummy CTM was waiting for me in the warming window and was tasty, moist and spicy (medium).  The samosa was yummy, but a little tough.  I shared both with my colleague and it was enough for lunch for the both of us.  Otherwise I'd be asleep under my desk right about now . . . \n\nMy only recommendation would be to provide larger condiment containers.  The teeny ones don't hold enough and your customers will end up using twice or three times as many as a result.", "author": "Mrs P."}

My husband and I shared the \"special\" chiken tikka sweet potato fries (quite tasty), a paneer burrito (average), and a deconstructed samosa without meat (decent).  The best of the three was definitely the chiken tikka with fries special.  Again, I was glad to have a mango lassi with the food, but this time it was a nice complement as opposed to a necessary fire extinguisher.  $24 for all of the above, and it took about 20 minutes total.  It was also CASH ONLY so we had to hit an ATM - fortunately, there's a Wells Fargo directly across from the truck.  I asked for the burrito \"extra mild\" and was told that they're \"already made kind of spicy.\"  You can get some yogurt to cool it off in the little mini cups on the right corner of the area below the cash register.  All in all, a better experience than last year, and I give it a fourth star for the fun/unique factor.", "author": "Molly P."}

I was actually excited about trying India food from a food truck, after all street food in India is pretty good and being Indian, I could not pass it up.  Unfortunately, the first try we could not find it; so when we came back into the city on the end of week long trip I had a second chance!  I was not disappointed, standing in line in the rain, I ordered the paneer Kati roll, the chicken Kati roll, and the samosa decomposed.   My wife and I were impressed with both of the rolls, she even said the paneer roll reminded her of the ones she had in India.  I thought it was spicy, tangy, the chicken was tender and overall excellent blend of tastes.  The samosa was good, the chick pea (chole) over powers the taste of the samosa, but it is still a unique combination and worth a try.  After finishing my roll I went back for seconds!", "author": "Ashish R."}

I'd promised myself I'd be spending less money on food but with the throngs of hopefuls waiting for their orders and the delicious smell wafting from the truck, I couldn't resist.  Despite having a very long line, it moved quickly and the guy didn't ask disdainful when I asked what methi pulao is - it's rice with fenugreek FYI... it was hard to decide among the deconstructed samosa, tikka masala & vindaloo burritos!  I decided to go with the chicken vindaloo, to which I added onions and I was not disappointed.  8 bucks is for lunch is a lot for a nonprofit worker like me but once I felt the heft of the fragrant burrito - I did not regret my purchase.  When I bit into the burrito, the weight of a small baby, I was greeted by a symphony of delicious flavors.  If you're not so big like me, I promise you this burrito will make 2 meals - so at 4 bucks a meal, a great deal!  And even if you end up devouring the whole thing (and spending the next few hours in a curry foodbaby hangover), it'll be worth it... so so good.

Next on the list is a deconstructer samosa. What genius.  Spice,  chutney, chicken or veg, chickpeas and I don't know what else.  It is SO good,  and SO filling,  for $4!!

Co-worker had their Burrito and the Chicken Deconstructed Samosa.  Both were good.  But, the only gripe I had was when I was given the bag.  Because I had ordered (3) things they gave me a paper bag.  I don't know what it is about their truck, but it seemed higher than the others.  So much so that I had to tip-toe to place and grab my order.  Never had to stretch so much for the others.  I grabbed the bag and held it similarly to how it was given to me.  But, when I walked back to work, it started dripping heavily.  I didn't realize why and could not find any paper towels or any kind of contraption to stop the drippings.  When I finally did, I realized that the deconstructed samosa was in a to go container and that the drippings were coming from that.  Had I known or was told by the person that was giving it to me, I would have carried it better and my clothes wouldn't be stained.  Minus 1 star for that.  Besides my mishap with the bag, we were happy with our selections.  Burrito was huge!  This was probably 2 servings or maybe 3?  Deconstructed Samosa was so good.  Flavors were nice.

There were only 3 people in line in front of me, but it was taking forever. They had the main guy ringing people up, then 3 people working on orders. Three different people came up and said they had placed orders online and I'm not sure what the problem was, but no one knew anything about them. Kept asking each person the same questions, what did you order, what is your name, what did you order again?? Then they just made the stuff right then and there, so those of us in line had to wait even longer. Doesn't seem like a great system. What really inspired me to write the update though, is that I requested my Chicken burrito 'spicy'. I do this most places I go, I love really spicy food. I can't remember a time when what I ordered has been too spicy, I'm sure it's happened, but the burrito I got was insane. Although I managed to get it down, I drank 30oz of water in doing so -- have to refill my 24oz water bottle, I was able to see how much I was drinking. Like I said, I'm really not a wimp when it comes to 'spicy' but while I was able to force this down, it was not enjoyable and I imagine for most who say, 'oh ya, i like spicy food', this would be inedible to them.

She said that usually the cashier warns their customers about how spicy their burritos are when you order a spicy one and most likely it was a new worker which was one of the reasons I probably had a sub-par, dry burrito. I decided to take on that offer today and brought my cousin along since their location this time was at Burlingame along Howard/Primrose and since it was on the way to my other cousin's house where we were heading to to begin with. We got 2 MILD Chicken Tikka Masala burritos this time. I decided to buy 2 Mango Lassi's as well since I already felt bad of me getting the burritos for free. The cashier offered saying it's okay, but I insisted in paying for them. Now I can say it definitely deserves the stars that people have been rating them worth for. Our burritos were very tasty and definitely MOIST, hot, and juicy this time unlike my previous one which was dry, cold, and very spicy making it unedible. For mild, it actually has a bit of a kick. I might push my luck and try a medium next time though. The mango lassi's this time didn't have any mint leaves which I was surprised, but definitely was a plus for me and still was very refreshing, creamy, smooth and tasty. My cousin wasn't a big fan of it seeing as he has quite a sweet tooth. It was sour to him due to the yogurt in it so I gladfully drank his, lol. Rani is a very serious owner of her business who definitely cares about her customers feedback being it good OR bad. I will definitely keep coming back for more. I'm going to try the deconstructed samosas next time since my friend highly recommends it. 4 stars from a very satisfied customer.", "author": "Sean E."}

A little constructive criticism: they need an assembly line process for this. pre-make the burritos and just hand them out as people pay. they have the burritos sitting there ready to be bought, but the cashiers are sooo slow. it shouldn't take so long, they are losing a lot of business.", "author": "Jay D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-06", "description": "Stopped by their truck at the Eat Real Festival in Jack London Sq. last weekend. I ordered the veggie samosas, one of my favorite Indian dishes, but found them to be disappointingly bland and crudely formed.. Way too much dough and not nearly enough spice. Really missed the cumin hit that I'm accustomed to. BUT...the sauces were FABULOUS! And what beautiful colors! I ladled on the white raita, a great green cilantro sauce, and best of all, a very bright red hot chile sauce. Man, was that good! I have not stopped thinking about it. It was really hot...burned my mouth, but I like it like that. I mopped up these excellent sauces with the potato-filled samosas and that more than made up for the bland doughiness of it all. Seems like the Chicken Tikka Burrito was the thing to order but I didn't know that. Anyway, I'm dying to find out what kind of peppers were used in their red hot sauce. That sauce alone made me a fan. Next time I'll try the burrito. I'm going to give them 4 stars based on their sauces alone.", "author": "Blue S."}
