I ordered a sandwich online via Yelp for takeout. I understand the estimate says 30-40 minutes. However, the place was dead when I walked in. A lunch rush came in right after me; I had ordered before every person in line even walked in the door and half of them got served before me. This is after a 20% tip and identifying myself at the register. A meter maid was circling my car like a vulture because it almost ran out of the 25 minutes I put on it waiting so long for a 6\" sub - no drink, no chips, no desserts - just a single regular size sub. The staff acted like I was an entitled white guy for wanting to be served in order and in a timely fashion for a simple order for which I tipped 20% and almost cost me the price of a parking ticket to boot.", "author": "Steve S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-12", "description": "Jamie W. and I don't make it to Noe Valley much. We love the neighborhood, but from where we are in SoMa, it always seems a tad more of a trek than our lazy derrieres are willing to handle although it's admittedly a simple J-ride away. That myopic attitude has been modified recently by this unassuming sandwich shop on the corner of 24th and Castro. Now sandwich shops are a dime a dozen, and I do go to Subway every now and then to get my BMT fix. However, a really well made sandwich is gold, especially in Jamie's book since he is a connoisseur of sorts. We finally gave it a try a couple of months ago late on a Saturday when we weren't feeling like a fine dining experience. Which is often, by the way. There are about a couple of dozen sandwiches on their chalkboard and then several options of toppings and such after that.\n\nI was facing that Starbucks conundrum of making six decisions in quick succession and hoping for the best. I did good as I ordered the $8.25 Mortadella with Provolone on Dutch Crunch. I got it with the works: mustard, plenty of mayo, shredded lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian herb sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1bLWinm). Now that was a sandwich. No art but so satisfying. Jamie went with the $8 Italiano with salami and ham on Dutch Crunch (photo: http://bit.ly/1zVjgDV). Same extras as me and just as tasty. They don't offer fries, but we really didn't need them. We entertained the possibility of a scoop of Mitchell's ice cream since they offer it, but sound judgment won us over after all. We returned just this past weekend, although truth be told, Jamie went on his own a couple of times in between without me.\n\nHe has become obsessed with the Large $11.25 Godfather, which offers the triple play of turkey, corned beef and pastrami, this time on a sourdough bun with the works including pepperoncinis (photo: http://bit.ly/1HbjvKV). I decided to try the $8 San Franciscan with roast beef and turkey on Dutch Crunch, again with the works (photo: http://bit.ly/1PfFWG2). I figured out it's the way they toast the bread that really makes it tasty as the rest of the ingredients are fairly standard-issue when I closely examined what I was chewing. They've really figured out something here that makes me think of this place in the same thought bubble as Lou's Cafe, The Yellow Submarine or Roxie Food Center. That's not a bad thought bubble to share if you ask me. And you did ask me, right?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...satisfying sandwiches lies in the execution with the bread perfectly toasted\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...it is a sandwich shop after all\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quick but amiable sandwich makers\nTOTAL - 4 stars...finally a food destination in Noe Valley we can rally behind without emptying out an ATM", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-21", "description": "1) My review would be higher if the sandwiches were consistent. Some days great, other days terrible. They do certain things well and others very badly. As a paying customer, one deserves to order two different sandwiches and have them be almost equal in quality.\n\n2) I never seem to get as much meat as they advertise in the pictures on their website. A common practice in food but it would be great if you were known as the place to order a meaty sub and always really drive this home. However, being the main sandwich shop in the area, I can see that foot traffic and convenience work well in their favor regardless of the portions.\n\n3) Please, please clean your seating area and floors more. Your shop could pull in more business in a demanding city if you had a higher level of standard. San Franciscans expect more and in order to survive the economy, this needs to be catered to (as most very successful and long lasting businesses have learned. This is truer specifically for this neighborhood. Move this to the Mission and I would say something different. Go a little bit further in your staff training and your expectations of cleanliness and compare your yearly profits.\n\nHowever, the service is kind and speedy, the options are diverse and classic, the ice cream is a nice addition, and the portions compared to prices are fair. I will be returning because what you do well, you do very well and your location cannot be beaten. Work on your shortcomings which are easy fixes and reap the rewards.", "author": "Brittany A."}

Then explained her rudeness to her boss by making up a story about me swearing at her on the phone, and I was very publicly accused by the manager who made a scene. No thanks, I didn't deserve that.\n\nEdit:\n1 - If your employee cuts me off every time I try to speak with a polite-sounding phrase, she is still repeatedly cutting me off and that is extremely rude. You just hear her saying 'please' repeatedly, and not her cutting me off, and think she's acting appropriately.\n2 - I was shocked that she had accused me of swearing and that was the first thing you opened with, which is why I was tense and serious. You're the one who opened with accusations, not me. I even thought there might have been truth to that and initially felt bad. But two people in the room confirmed I didn't, which made me realize how your employee was just giving you a reason to dismiss me.\n3 - After speaking to my roommates, I tried to contact you via email at your contact at your website, and got an email delivery failure. Not my fault you have no method of contact besides yelp. Just saw a new website went live with an actual functioning contact page, which you did not have at the time.\n4 - Falsely accusing me of swearing and having a store full of customers staring at me is making a scene. Period.\n5 - All I ask is for kindness and understanding when I'm trying to get order. I asked her to confirm with another employee and she said she couldn't. And then I immediately learn from you in the store that you were next to her the whole time. She could have easily resolved the issue by asking you whether policy changed, which is all I was asking on the phone. Again, I remind you that this same phone conversation happened a few months ago with a different employee and at the time you didn't have two sizes of sourdough.

I personally could not find a better place in the area that could deliver great tasting and large subs like Subs Inc.

I like how they toast all your subs and they come out hot. I don't think upgrading to large is that much worth it, because the subs are pretty big anyways.

The guy at the counter asked if I'd like a small or large and replied, \"small.\" The portions are good. I'll give them that. \n\nI took a spot close to the front of the shop next to the window and waited for my sandwich to come. When it was finally ready, a woman called out, \"tuna sandwich!\" Immediately I thought, \"uh oh!\" \n\nShe dropped it off on my table and I asked her, \"tuna melt, right?\" She wasn't too sure of herself either and said, \"yea.\" The sandwich that showed up was a tuna sub where the bread was toasted, similarly to what I'd get at a Subway. I took a bite just hoping, by surprise, that it tasted like what anybody would consider a tuna melt. NOPE!\n\nI took the sandwich back to the counter just to double-check with the guys who made it. They asked me if I had wanted a cold tuna sandwich instead. I said, \"well, all the tuna melts I've had at other places, the sandwich came off a grill and the tuna was actually sort of grilled or hot.\" One of the guys responded, \"We just put the bread in the toaster.\" I said, \"Okay. No problem.\" Then I took my sandwich and walked away back to my table.\n\nI am super disappointed, because I saw four stars for this spot before I showed up. That's super deceptive. I would not call it a \"tuna melt\" if it resembles nothing like a grilled tuna sandwich similarly to a grilled cheese in appearance and/or flavor\" \n\nWhat I got was a toasted tuna sub. Definitely not worth the approximate $8.50 that I had spent on it.", "author": "David W."}

I feel like finding a good sandwich in the city is difficult.  I can find plenty of spots that have all the right ingredients, but they are never made with \"love\"...well I found my new spot, cause not only is the staff friendly, but they put a little love into the food.  The bread is amazing, especially the dutch crunch.  I've never been one to order a meatball sandwich, but decided to try something different on my 3rd visit and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fantastic!  I have yet to be disappointed with a sandwich or the customer service.  Plus, I found out today you can add garlic to your sandwich.  What's that you say?  Garlic?  Yes folks, that's right, a bacon, avocado, turkey melt on dutch crunch, add garlic...I'm a happy woman!", "author": "Aimee S."}

After going by this place many times and seeing the great reviewes, I waited until I was good and hungry and finally made my way there.\n\nFirst thing that I noticed was that it was clear that the owner was behind the counter (always a plus).  I asked him what a newcomer should order and he suggested the Godfather.  Given my great love of the Godmother at Bay Cities Cafe in Santa Monica, I couldn't resist.\n\nThen, while waiting, two things happened that made me suspect the sandwich I was about to eat was going to be great.  First, after a little consideration, the owner mentioned that I might want to add garlic sauce and hot sauce to the sandwich and that they were both homemade.  Sold.  Second, every customer than came in after me was greeted by name and were obviously frequent customers.\n\nThen, my sandwich arrived.  A measure of a good sandwich is how well it stays together despite being covered in many sauces, sliding tomatoes, and shredded lettuce.  This sandwich held together and now holds a little piece of my heart.\n\nIncidentally, I was also blessed by some dinner theater while I was there.  One of the customers came in and had a 5 minute conversation with the owner about his disappointment that dutch crunch was the only bread available for a large sandwich that day.

But I've already signed your petition before, I'm too broke to donate money, and quite frankly, I'm fairly apathetic for someone who graduated with a Political Science degree.\n\nI was on my way to Subs, Inc., earlier this week when I got stuck at a red light with a Greenpeace dude.

Bought myself a rockin' turkey and avocado sandwich. Having just moved from the Castro, where I was surrounded by solid sub choices (Ike's, Posh Bagel, Delano's Deli), I'd like to think I have pretty high standards.

They got good customer service skills - right on!\n\n- The sandwich bread was really good.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- I have a thing about hot lettuce and hot mayo - EW! I'm old school in that I believe only meatball subs should be served hot, but that's me (old). So I asked the guy if I could get my salami sandwich cold. He said yes, but then stuck it in the oven anyway. Normally that kind of mistake would send me packing but I recognize that I might not have made it clear enough that I actually wanted my sandwich cold AND he offered to start over, so I decided to let it be.\n\n- Despite my desire to be zen about the hotness, I took the sub home a few blocks away and found what I suspected... wilted lettuce drown in a sea of melting mayo. The wilted lettuce was kinda my fault since I didn't ask for him to start it over, but the pool of mayo was uncalled for. Proportions are crucial to a sandwich and I'm telling you the amount of mayo they piled on was insane either hot or cold. There's no way anyone looking at me would think I need even a fraction of the amount they included. In fact, I don't look like I need a sandwich at all. Hmf.\n\n- Pricey. A \"regular\" sub tops out at over $7. I wouldn't mind if it didn't disappoint, but it did. Majorly. I might consider Subs Inc. for ice cream. As for sandwiches - pass.", "author": "Prattle P."}

Never a screw-up! \n\nThe mixed meat jobs are my favorites. The toasting of the sub in the small ovens is a new wrinkle that took some getting used to, but now I love it!  The garlic spread (you need to request it) is also a great, new addition. I already mention the great breads and ingredients, so now I'm finished. Try this place if you love sub sandwiches. \nLarry\nP.S. One hour free parking is available alongside Walgreen's across the street", "author": "laurence c."}

Best sub I've ever had.  Seemed to melt in my mouth and was bursting with flavor.   Will definitely come back.   My only gripe is that all their subs are toasted, even the veggie ones, and I like to save money by not toasting.  (If you heat the food, California sales tax kicks in, but if it's unheated and taken to go then usually no tax.)  But I'll pay the tax for these subs... yum.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Alas, there was nothing in our neighborhood that came close to making a great sandwich.  You can imagine my excitement when I saw the sign go up for Subs, Inc. -- I just knew it had hot subs written all over it.  And sure enough, as we found out on opening day, the sandwiches are all given their time in a little oven.  The actual execution is not quite up to Marina Subs or Toaster Oven, but it is still a much welcomed place.  The Poor Boy could use slightly more toasting and the Avocado and Cheese could use some more ingredients (see Marina Subs for guide).  The employees and owners are super nice and the prices right.
