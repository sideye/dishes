I opted for the Pappardelle Bolognese, and my man had the Lasagna (both fantastic). \n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous inside- perfect lighting and charming, classic Italian decor. A few large mirrors really open up the space, and I couldn't help but notice that they were all absolutely spotless despite the fact that we came in during the very last hour of service. \n\nThe owner obviously takes great pride in his establishment and making it the best it can be- and that is probably my favorite thing about Ristorante Parma. I loved the fact that it was the charming owner who seated us, and later discovering that his daughter was our lovely waitress/server. Family run establishments are the best, and this one stands out as my new favorite Italian restaurant in San Francisco. Being born and raised here in the city, I'm just sad that I didn't discover Ristorante Parma sooner. \n\nI'll definitely be back with friends and family- best dining experience I've had in a long time. \n\nThank you!! xx Pamela", "author": "Pamela .."}

On first sight it reminded us of our visit to the beautiful Tuscany last year - the decor is very tuscan- with the big bricks and medieval colors , even the wine glasses they used (not super fancy like other places but more in line with what we saw in Italy), the wine pours (very generous ) and the most imp trait - excellent house wine!\n\nWe ordered the eggplant and crostini , butternut squash ravioli, chicken in butter lime sauce with capers and everything was excellent! Loved the chicken secondi especially - it was served with polenta and veggies. The espresso and tiramisu (though it was a little different from the typical tiramisu available elsewhere - no cocoa on top) were a perfect way to end.\n\nLoved the restaurant - will return!

Even the bread with the garlic, olive oil and balsamic is amazing. \n\nWe always start out with a salad and our favorite is the hearts of romaine dish. The grilled pear gives it a burst of sweetness while the walnuts add the perfect crunch. My husband usually orders the pesto or the eggplant dish. And he really enjoys both dishes. I always get the dish with cream sauce, peas and prosciutto. It's so good. When we're not too stuffed, we order the tiramisu for dessert.

She was impatient, irritated, and unhelpful to any of our questions. It was odd because she was attentive to everyone around us, but lost her smile and friendly vibe when she greeted us, even when we JUST SAT DOWN! \n\n1. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, so we asked for a recommendation on something sweet and light. She named the sweetest one on the menu, followed by the snarky remark, \"You're basically drinking ALL sugar. If you want to drink all sugar, then I'd suggest that bottle.\" Then rolled her eyes impatiently. Uh...rude....why would you talk about the bottles on your menu like that or even throw attitude at a PAYING GUEST. \n\n2. She then let us sample it. I took a small sip, then waited a little for the taste buds to kick in. She impatiently waited for my response. After saying it was good (without giving her the go that I actually wanted it), she poured (impatiently dumped) a whole cup worth into my glass. Her letting us 'sample it' made us feel like we were already obligated to stick with that wine bottle. We didn't want to start a fuss, so we just kept that bottle. \n\n3. I wanted to order a creamy fettuccine pasta type, but wasn't familiar with the menu. I asked for another recommendation on something similar to that, and she responded, \"Okay, anything with the words CREAMY will have that sauce.\" Clearly I know that, but I was asking for a recommendation!! Why assume I would know what's good on the menu? I quickly showed her a picture I saw on yelp then went with that because she was clearly getting more irritated out of no where.\n\nAll in all, the pastas were good, but it wasn't worth the lack of respect or unbelievably rude service we received. Not only are you paying for the food, it's the ambiance, service, and overall environment as well. It wasn't as if we were indecisive, we just asked for recommendation for two things. The most basic question any server would be asked, yet we received dirt treatment. I would never come back for that sole reason. What's worst is that the server was clearly the owner's family or one of the daughter's of the owner. And after reading other reviews, it seems as though I'm not the only one who's had a terrible dining experience here based off that same server.", "author": "Miranda T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-28", "description": "(To read about their lasagna, skip to paragraph 4)\n\nI love food. I love it! So I'll start by saying that I don't mind waiting a reasonable amount of time for some quality fine dining, I even expect to have to wait.\n\nWaiting for over an hour for our appetizers however, seems excessive. Having to wait an ADDITIONAL hour for my entree is ridiculous. As I've stated, I can accept waiting for fine food. I however was not prepared to wait for milk to curdle into the ricotta for my lasagna. Now, this alone would make me upset, but I used to wait tables and I understand that some nights things just don't go right. I understand that it's not necessarily my server's fault. I can be forgiving when it's deserving. But when our waiter is unapologetic and downright rude, this dining \" experience\" has just become unacceptable. \n\nThe hallmark of good service is this: do my beverage glasses ever go empty? If so, for how long? Last night, every glass on the table went empty, even the water glasses, until we repeated asked for refills. At Parma it would seem that refilling drinks is not in the wait staff's job description, and they are too good for that kind of demeaning work. Now this was especially upsetting to me since my water and ice tea were my only means of sustenance for what seemed an eternity.\n\nNow, mind you, I wasn't being an ass. Parma is one of my in-laws' favorite Bay Area establishments. My mother in-law worked closely with one of the owner's daughters and they are considered friends of the family at Parma. I wouldn't embarrass my family by making a scene or by being rude, I just think that he standard of service from the Parma staff is going down the toilet. This suspicion is only confirmed by the other bad reviews of Parma starring the owner's other daughter. \n\nAll this aside, how was the food you ask? Good, but not worth the wait or the rude \"service\". I ordered the lasagna which is one of their signature dishes, and while it tasted authentic and fresh, it was just good, not mind blowing. It had a little too much acidity, and the ingredients were not well balanced in my opinion. The lasagna noodles were al dente which was different, not necessarily bad... just different. My wife had the lamb chops, they looked delicious, but I was fuming at that point and had no desire to taste them. My in-laws were seated behind me so I didn't see what they ordered, nor did I really care at that point. \n\nMy recommendation:\nDon't waste your time with Parma. Go to Il Fornio. Go to the Italian restaurant around the corner. Go anywhere else. If you have no choice but to dine at Parma, don't go there hungry. Don't go there expecting to be wowed by great service. In fact, don't go to Parma expecting much of anything and maybe, just maybe, you won't be let down.", "author": "jason l."}

Also moderately priced.\n\nEverything from the bread with the garlicky olive oil, to the salami/prosciutto/cheese plate, to the main courses were very tasty. \n\nLoving authentic Italian, I assumed this place served \"americanized\" pasta dishes. But I was pleasantly surprised. I asked if they could make their spaghetti alla carbonara with egg instead of cream sauce, and they said \"that's how we do it.\" It did have a little cream or butter added but tasted fantastic. \n\nThe three others I was with ordered pasta dishes as well and those were all really good too. \n\nWould definitely recommend this place for anyone craving Italian who happens to be in the neighborhood.", "author": "Brandon C."}

Parma's got you covered.\n\nSmall, cozy, and adorned with murals of Roman ruins (I mean, what else would you expect?), Parma is the place you bring your parents to and/or have a standing Saturday night dinner at when you're 65. But don't get me wrong, it's gooooood.\n\nManager is very friendly and charming in the brusque Italian sorta way- but perhaps not always the most honest when it comes to wait times.. So take it with a grain of salt ;) Once you do get seated though, service plays to your mood. Attentive and quick if that's what you're looking for, or more slow and dragged out if you're trying to have a vino-pasta-tiramisu sorta night. \n\nMeatballs and caprese are great to start with and definitely make sure you leave room for their spectacularly garlic oil and vinegar dipping sauce. Although you may leave smelling like garlic for days, it's 100% worth it.\n\nAll their pastas are delicious and homemade but the real winner of their mains is their veal piccata. Mamma mia! I'm not even a big fan of veal, but the tender meat paired with a deliciously lemony sauce and topped with capers makes for a winning meal. Highly highly recommend.\n\nAll in all, a great neighborhood spot, good food, and fun for a quick date or a more celebratory meal.

Cheese in entrees.\n\nSuggestion:  If the kids get unruly, slap them with bread.

However, this time my wife and I had our 7 year old granddaughter in tow for a tour of the Exploratorium by the Palace of Fine Arts.  So we decided to find a place in the neighborhood.\n\nYelp indicated there were many fine restaurants with a variety of cuisines around the Marina district.  Since we're partial to parmesan and needed to find a kid-friendly location, we chose Ristorante Parma.\n\n-   Menu:  Not as extensive as you find in our typical suburban Italian restaurant, but maybe there's something to be said for a more limited selection and doing it right.  Even with the number of choices cut down to size, I'm sure most people will find several good-sounding dishes.\n\n-   Wine List:  Similar to the food menu.  Smaller than usual, but with a sufficient number of reasonable alternatives in most categories.  However, my wife wanted a glass of chardonnay, but had to settle for the house wine.  Nothing off the wine list appeared available in a 6-8 ounce version.\n\n-   Food:  My wife and I started by sharing a Caesar Salad advertised for 2.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty, but the size was more Weight Watchers than Hungry Man.  For $14.50, it was puny..even in SF.  For an entr\u00e9e, I ordered my old standby...Eggplant Parmigiana.  It was certainly big for $13.95, but the cheese overwhelmed everything else. You could drown in it.  I like cheese, but if candy can give fits to a diabetic person, this dish would deliver a major dose of gas to the lactose-intolerant.  I almost had to cover my mouth and stand up just thinking about it.\n\nMy wife had one of her favorites, Chicken Marsala, and thought it was a reasonable rendition of that dish.  Our granddaughter, bless her simple tastes ( as of now ), was content to eat a bowl of pasta with butter.  They even made 2 glasses of chocolate milk for her which was not on the menu.\n\n-   Bread:  I really like bread.  Maybe too much.  But at least for an Italian restaurant, it's sort of a cultural thing so it deserves its own paragraph.  At Ristorante Parma, it was plain and ordinary.  Perhaps they feel the olive oil and small chunks of garlic would redeem the bread.  For me, it would make a great doorstop. I ate it because I was hungry.\n\n-   Price and Value:  Aside from the Caesar Salad, the rest of the meal was fairly priced.  Total before the tip ( including a Peroni beer for me ) was $77.\n\n-   Service:   We were the first patrons to arrive when the place opened at 5 PM and service was promptly paced.  Most of the meal was handled by a friendly young woman, but she disappeared before the entrees were delivered and a guy took her place.  I saw her again at the end.  He was a nice guy, but still?  She said her cousin arrived and she wanted to catch up with him.  Maybe that's SF?  Maybe just the price for a neighborhood feeling?  Maybe we should eat where my relatives work?\n\n-   Dining Area:  The room is narrow and deep with a series of tables for 2, 3 and 4 which are easily combined for larger groups.  It's low key, tasteful and clean ( where I looked ).  Even the bathroom ( space for 1 ) was okay.  You won't need gloves, at least early in the evening.\n\n-   Parking:  Good luck.  The immediate streets are a mess, but there were spaces a few blocks north toward the Marina.\n\nWould I go again?  Possibly if I lived nearby and developed into a regular.  But as an infrequent visitor to town, I'd check out the hundreds of other choices in search of a meal which begs me to ask for more.", "author": "Richard N."}

I came here for dinner with a group of five girls, in typical girl fashion we all showed up at different times. When four our of the five of us were there we decided to order some wine, the waiter had checked in and we asked for just a minute to decide on a bottle, ten minutes later he still hadn't come back to the table. He was sitting in the front of the restaurant on his phone -- there was only one other table in the restaurant. We finally said 'excuse me may we order wine' and he audibly sighed, walked over and said 'are you ready?!' It was really aggressive and it was clear he was annoyed with us, although, I'm not quite sure why as everyone at our table was very polite. His service did not get better through out the night, he was annoyed when we told him we could pour our own wine, annoyed when we said we didn't want salads to start, just over all very rude and irritable. Luckily there were two other servers who ended up taking over and it was a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe food itself was awesome, totally lived up to our expectations! It definitely did take a little while to get the food out even though it wasn't very busy but it was worth the wait. I got the lasagne and it was sooo good, HUGE portion, and just made perfectly.

My husband and I live less than a block away from here so we have been to Parma a good 15 or so times in the last year and a half.  A few people have referenced the older gentleman who seats people (the owner) - he always treated us pretty well.  \n\nWell, there's a new chick at the door who happens to be the owner's daughter.  I just had twins about 6 months ago, and one evening we went in to get a table and when I asked the wait time she looked at me and my babies and then said, \"it's an hour.  Sorry.\" And then walked away.  Lady...maybe I don't mind waiting an hour.  I thought maybe I was just being sensitive about the whole kid thing and it was all in my head.  \n\nA few weeks later, we went back with my in-laws and the babies and there were tons of tables open so they couldn't make up any excuses this time.  The entire time we were there, we were shuffled through and given rude looks.  I'm talking straight eye rolling.  Not only were my babies NOT crying or being bad, but other customers were coming up to see them and talk with us, so it didn't seem like we were bothering any of the their guests.  I thought this was a FAMILY run establishment??\n\nTonight, I went back with some friends (no babies) and we were treated so rudely by this same woman.  It's beyond me how she is in charge of this restaurant when her dad's not there.  When we gave her multiple credit cards to split the check with, she looked at us and said, \"I can only charge 2 cards, thank you.\" And then she chucked the cards and check back at us.  I mean, that's not a problem but why do you have to be so rude about it?   She then proceeded to stand at the back of the restaurant with her arms crossed and staring at us.  The place was basically empty, so it's not like we were taking up prime real estate.  \n\nThe food's fine, but definitely not worth being treated like dirt for.

The service was horrible. I think our waitress spoke to us a total of 3 times. She was not friendly nor helpful in any way. The pasta was just okay, nothing different then pasta you can make at home. The true winner on the menu is the lasagna. My bf ordered that and I have to say it was amazing, but everything else was just a let down.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-21", "description": "4.5 stars rounded up.\n\nEverything about Parma says Italia.  The inside is made to look like an old alleyway in Rome - rustic, romantic, and beautiful.  The servers have many, many regular customers and all know them by name.  The food comes in large portions obviously cooked by people know exactly what they're doing.\n\nSince Parma doesn't take reservations (open only for dinners and they're closed Sundays), we decided to head there right after work, around 6:30.  The restaurant was maybe 1/3 occupied, so we scored a nice table in the back.  Bread and a garlic-olive oil-balsamic vinegar bowl came out.  The concoction is VERY garlic-heavy and also VERY yummy.\n\nWe started off with the Gamberetti del Porto, which is essentially lightly-battered and pan-fried rock shrimp.  Think popcorn shrimp, but with a lighter, more delicious batter and more tender, juicy pieces of shrimp.  It came with a creamy garlic aioli dipping sauce, which was a good complement to the crunchy batter.  Boyfriend ordered the insalata mista, which was just basic mixed greens and garlic vinaigrette.  I would love to have the salad with maybe a few pieces of grilled shrimp, and that would be a great light lunch, as the dressing isn't your typical boring vinaigrette; garlic lovers would be pleased.\n\nI ordered the fettucine bolognese, which was some of the best restaurant-made meat sauce I've ever had.  The meat was not cooked to a shriveled mess, and it was not watery at all.  It tasted fresh, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  Boyfriend had the lasagna, which WAS AMAZING.  Wonderful combination of flavors, and it was a huge hefty portion.  And I don't even like lasagna!\n\nTiramisu ended my meal (of course, how can I NOT order tiramisu at an Italian restaurant?) - it was a good finish, not too sweet, airy and light.  Chocolate-loving Boyfriend ordered the chocolate lava cake, which I found entirely too sweet and too heavy (keep in mind that I don't really like chocolate).  But it's exactly what it sounds like - chocolate cake, with a molten chocolate center, and he loved it.\n\nI decided to round up to 5 stars because I already know that I would want to come back to try other things on their menu.  Even though the restaurant filled up and the noise level rose towards the end, it doesn't have the pretentious feel that Capannina has (even though I love their food as well).

But be aware.. this place is in the Marina district which means parking is scarce!! \n\nThis place is very cozy, a mom and pop place. \nArrived and was seated in about 10 mins. As a bunch of other reviews have already said, their garlic vinaigrette & olive oil dip was DELISH! I'm NOT a garlic person at all.. my friends who know me know that i don't eat garlic.. or onions for that matter. But i decided to give the dip a try since i love bread with vinaigrette. It was addicting! I kept wanting more, no seriously.. you gotta try for yourself!\n\nAppetizer: We ordered the bruschetta. Very simple dish.. toasted baguette, tomato and basil infused with olive oil, pinch of pepper, and diced up garlic. \n\nEntrees: ME- I ordered the Penne Romanoff (penne with sausage & mushroom in red tomato sauce). This was very flavorful, but very heavy and meaty. I'm a sucker for sausage and mushroom (just like the toppings I would order on my pizzas!) so I went with this classic dish. I was only able to finish half my dish.\nHIM - The bf ordered the Spaghetti Vongole (spaghetti with clams, mussels, and shrimp in a garlic tomato sauce). Honestly.. I liked his dish more than mines. But don't get me wrong! I enjoyed both pastas!! But if I had to pick, I would choose the seafood pasta. Very yummy.. the seafood wasn't over-powering, jumbo shrimps, garlic tomato sauce was perfect.

So, you should definitely go early (and I think they may take reservations for big parties as I saw a big table that looked quasi-reserved).  \n\nIt's a small, cute little place with reasonably priced entrees and yummy garlic and balsamic vinegar dipping sauce.  I was SO hungry and just chowed; I don't typically like bread much but that dipping sauce would probably make anything taste good.  For my entree, I got the (non P.C.) veal tortellini with pancetta cream sauce (nothing like a two-meat entree).  It was definitely tasty, though not out of this world.  My friends were happy with their dishes too - salmon and asparagus pasta and the fusilli with chicken.  The wine menu had a wide range of prices for cheap-os like me.  :-)\n\nThe service was mixed.  My friend and I were waiting for another friend, and she was a bit late looking for parking; I don't think the restaurant was particularly thrilled that we were waiting.

The place is pretty small and I was liking the decor and atmosphere. i was seated promptly and after ordering they brought out bread with a garlic/olive oil/balsamic dip that was freaking awesome. I've never had it with garlic and this was a great start. We had some fried rock shrimp as an appetizer and this really disappointed me. It was something like shrimp \"calamari\". the shrimp were small and the dish was not satisfying, nor did it live up to to my expectations. it was basically popcorn shrimp. \n\nThe pasta I had was a special, linguine with meatballs. (you'd expect spaghetti and meatballs to be a staple wouldnt you?) The portion was very generous, but not overwhelming. The red sauce was very flavorful, as were the 3 large meatballs. \n\nThis is a great place for a small group to have a long conversation Read: slow service, but is very welcoming, easy going, and a decent overall experience *aside from that shrimp*", "author": "James T."}

All in all food was decent, but certainly not as good as some Italian food I've had in North Beach. What was mostly disappointing was the service.

BEWARE.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Italian food just because it's SO HEAVY.  Pasta sauces and entrees become sickening after a while....\n\nBut holey bajeezes this place is great!!!!!  It's by far the best Italian food I've ever had in the city :D\n\nMy friend knows the owner, so we got VIP treatment when we arrived.  Angela, the owner's daughter, immediately came out to greet us and say hello.  She was uber friendly and goofy.  Just like family.\n\nFirst came the bruschetta.  Fresh tomatoes atop a buttery, lightly toasted, slice of baguette.  YUM!\n\nNext came the bread and balsamic vinegar with oil.  They dump a heapful of garlic to make it extra spicy.  The sour balsamic vinegar plus the spicy garlic really gave me dragon breath, but it was allll worth it... this is DELICIOUS!!  For 5 people, I think we had 4 refills of bread!!! :D\n\nNext came our appetizers.  My friends got the Caesar salad... which is DELICIOUS.  The dressing is home made and you can actually taste the anchovies.  My friend got extra dressing on the side and I could see that it was whipped and mixed to perfection.  They're not messing around!!!! this is the best Caesar dressing I've had yet.  Beats bottled crap 10x over!!  I got the tomato & basil with mozzarella.  I'm a huge fan of cheese and this mozzarella was fresh and stringy.  :)  \n\nNext came our main courses:  They ran out of the eggplant Parmesan, which I hear is the best dish in the restaurant... BOO FOR ME!  But I had the chicken and sun-dried tomato fusilli in a light cream sauce.  They weren't lying when they said light.  I can't tell you how many times I've had cream sauce in my pasta and it's completely drenched in  gooey cream.  The pasta was al dente, tossed in the light cream sauce (tasted milky versus fatty) and then put on the plate..  not too much, but just coated on the pasta.  fcking delicious... :)  I licked my plate clean.\n\nMy friends ordered the fettuccine and the lasagna.  Each deserves its own description:\n\nThe Fettuccine was hand pulled--you could taste the egg and the stringy texture that fettuccine is supposed to have.  The cream sauce was also very light for the pasta.  It definitely trumps all other fettuccine in the city.\n\nThe Lasagna was AMAZING.  Normally, when you order lasagna, they have a large dish of it in the back, they cut you a square, and then they microwave that shit and slap it on a plate.  HERE, they prep the ingredients beforehand and make it when you order it.  Then they bake it in the oven.  When it comes out to you, the tomato sauce has a crispy crust.... when you put your fork into it, it breaks exactly where you slice it.  Normally, when I cut my fork into lasagna, it pulls with it all its insides and the sauce, cheese, etc. (which is also usually watery), just spills all over the plate.  This doesn't.  This stays intact.  HINT:  Ask for extra meat sauce--it's delicious!!!   Did I mention it is made with real mozzarella and Parmesan cheese?  Leave the ricotta and weird stinky cheese out of it!!  (I love the stuff, but too much of it is always gooped in lasagna).\n\nP.S.  The Chianti is fantastic... It's not tart like the other wines, but smooth and easy to drink (uh oh!!)\n\nIn a nutshell--food made to order, al dente pasta in its true perfection, and worth a million trips over.  I'm taking the rest of my friends here for our next night out.  The Italian friends I was with were all raving about how the restaurant smelled like \"grandma's\" and how the food tasted so much like home-made.  Thank you Angela & crew... for the best meal I've had in a long time.\n\nP.P.S.  HELLO TO THE HOT BOYS AT THE NEXT TABLE.   CALL ME!!!!!!! :)", "author": "Steph M."}

Small, quaint, cozy, and beautifully decorated... not to mention the absolutely nommyful food.\n\nStarted out with bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and basil. It was seriously such an amazing combination; I'm surprised this is the first time I've seen a restaurant do it. The garlic and basil definitely gave it an extra kick.\n\nWe got the Fusilli con Pollo, Risotto, and Penne al Salmone and Asparagus. All were excellent; the flavors were all so well done and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The chicken in the fusilli was tender and juicy, the sundried tomatoes were the perfect flavor (more on the sweet side), and the cream sauce was done perfectly. The penne had a lighter taste and was complimented by the heavier flavor of the smoked salmon. Risotta was creamy and delicious.\n\nBottom line: Cute place to go with a small group of friends or with your date. Balanced and delicious flavors. Good sized portions.

The Boyfriend and the Sister and I were nearby jonesing for Italian food and picked Parma based on Yelp reviews. The inside is small and cozy and seats maybe around 45 people, plus or minus five. They don't take reservations, but we walked in on a Thursday night at around 6:30 and there were plenty of tables open. \n\nThe food is solid. The Boyfriend got the Veal Picatta, the Sister got the Fettuccini Bolognese and I got one of the specials - pumpkin ravioli. The veal was tender and well-seasoned, the fettuccini was perfectly cooked and the bolognese was meaty and hearty, just the way it should be. My pumpkin ravioli was delicious as well, but my only complaint is that it was too sweet. It was almost more of a dessert than a dinner. The pumpkin filling was rich and creamy so I could only eat a few pieces. \n\nThe portions are Italian-style, meaning large - I saw a lot of people taking leftovers home. \n\nThe dipping oil here, by the way, is REALLY garlicky! I loved it, but I still have the flavor in my mouth the morning after. \n\nFor the price, portions and palate-pleasing flavors, I give this place four stars. I'm looking forward to trying the tortellini with veal, prosciutto and peas and the Lasagna Bolognese. It looked so good!\n\nCheck here for the menu: http://www.themenupage.com/parmamenu.html", "author": "Christine P."}

Parma is a small, cute Italian restaurant that gives the impression of somewhere more expensive but is rather quite moderate in price; the entrees were around $12-16 and appetizers about $8-10. Of course, you can always rack up the bill with wine, but we'd gone for wine ahead of time like true champs. \n\nThe salads and appetizers are a small pre-meal size to leave room for pasta, so get a few if you plan to share within a group. The gnocci with red sauce and the eggplant lasagna were both delicious, and I loved the marinated mushroom appetizer. We left feeling just right - not overly full. \n\nThis is a nice place to have an early dinner - we were there around 5-6pm, and it looked like the room was really filling up when we left.

The food is very fresh, well prepared and the right quantity.\n\nRolled into Ristorante Parma around 9pm on a Monday night, so wasn't surprised to find it wasn't full. This is a good thing, because its really just a small, fairly narrow room. The waiter wasn't the greatest, completely forgetting to take our main course order, but this wasn't a problem as the owner swung by to check up on us. We were deep in conversation anyhow.\n\nOther reviews have mentioned the fresh bread with garlic and olive oil, which was very nice. We also ordered the Trio Misto, which is mozzarella, tomatoes and peppers. Also very nice.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Penne Romanoff, it was amazingly delicious. The portions were a regular size, so thankfully no waste. The vodka sauce mixed with sausages, mushrooms and tube pasta really was impressive.\n\nThey have a pretty decent wine list, with Italian and other wines. We just wanted drinks by the glass, so they offered us the varieties but no mention on the brand. I opted for the chianti, and my date got the pinot noir. Both were really nice, but I would have liked to choose the wine (and know the price-per-glass).\n\nThe food was amazing, the place had a good atmosphere.

The balance of flavors was nice. \n\nThe antipasto misto was standard salame and marinated fare out packages and jars. I thought the cantalope was pathetic given that we are in the middle of summer where beautiful vibrant melons are easily gotten if given the care.

No strong garlic, egg, cream, parmesan or pancetta flavors.\n\nThe Chicken Marsala was by far the most disapointing part of the meal. The chicken breasts were unseasoned and overcooked. I couldn't tell if they were fresh or frozen. The wine sauce was off the mark as well. It felt like they took shortcuts with thickeners and it ended up tasting processed. The mushrooms were presliced and prepared haphazardly. The potatoes that accompainied the dish  were pretty good but the sauteed spinach was embarrassingly bad. The menu advertised the entree as served with potatoes and vegetables of the day. Again if unsalted spinach is the vegetable of the day in the MIDDLE OF SUMMER I can only conclude that the owner is either lazy or doesn't care about trying to get his hands on the best product that he can. \n\nCheap product, lack of attention to detail and extremely dusty lint-filled walls shows me that the owner is content with mediocrity and I feel compelled to let people know.

Heck, I came here for dinner on Friday and, not only did I want to get a to-go order for a midnight snack, but I wanted to come back for dinner on Saturday  (I didn't do any of the above, but I wanted to ...) \n\nI ordered my favorite pasta dish of all-time - the Romanoff. If you like vodka sauce, you gotta try it. Of course, before eating my main course, I filled up on their incredible bread+garlic+balsamic+olive oil concoction and their paper-thin prosciutto wrapped canteloupe. I also fell in love with a new dish - their Spaghtti Carbonara is the BEST CARBONARA I've ever had!! Most carbonaras are too creamy and heavy, but this one was so light and tasty! \n\nWhen I return to Parma next Saturday, I'm going to have a lot of trouble deciding between the Romanoff and the Carbonara.

Its a cute restaurant on Steiner in the marina, the restaurant probably has about 10 tables all together so not really a huge place but service was good and atmosphere was cute and charming. Its definetely authentic italian food, we had the procuitto and melon as a appetizer- this was so good and fresh, prociutto was just the right amount of saltyness combined with the perfect ripened and sweet cantelope it was heavenly. came with three huge, thick slices of melon and prosciutto. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara and my BF ordered the  Prawn risotto with tomatoes and both were SO good. Came out pipping hot -my spaghetti had nice chewy little specs of carmelized panceetta and the pasta was perfectly cooked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-24", "description": "When I was 13, I went to Italy with my family, and ordered the same thing almost every night for two weeks. Spaghetti con pomodoro.  It was so good (and so distinct from America pasta sauce!) that I couldn't imagine wasting a meal on something else.  \n\nEver since, I've been looking for the same delicious, slightly sweet tomato sauce in the states, with no luck.  Until, that is, I stumbled upon Ristorante Parma with my parents who were visiting for the week.  We all had pasta dishes, so I can't vouch for anything else, but it was hands down the best Italian I've had in years.  I don't go out for Italian often, but when I do this is where I'll be heading.", "author": "Chelsea R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-08", "description": "Location can be a blessing or a curse.  For Parma, it's a little bit of both.  Nestled on Steiner just south of Isa and Bistro AIX, it's kinda like the red headed stepchild of the block.  I have passed by the place too many times to mention on my way to someplace else.  I must apologize to Parma for the egregious calumny.   My grandfathers should both rise from their graves and knock me into the middle of next week for walking past an Italian restaurant to dine at a whorish purveyor of small plates and a French inspired California  eatery.  I promise to say 100 Hail Marys as a penance.\n\nI finally walked into Parma for a Friday night meal.  First tip for visiting Parma: they don't take reservations, so get there early or be prepared to wait.  We got lucky and scored a table right away.  The interior is a little cheesy, but I enjoyed it.  They have gone for the \"crumbling ruins\" look that so many Italian restaurants espouse.  (Is there a chapter in restaurant design text books that dictates the interiors of Italian places must have either crumbling ruins or a fake clothes line?  I really want to know this.)  The space itself is very small and boxcarish, but Parma makes it work.  \n\nWe started with a Caesar salad for two.  This was the only part of my Parma experience that I did not enjoy.  It was all lettuce and dressing: no shaved Parmesan and no anchovies.  I need my anchovies!!!  After that, everything else was excellent.  Second tip when dining at Parma: avoid the dipping oil if you are on a date numbering in the single digits.  The garlic in the oil comes in staggering amounts.  This is fine if you are with a significant other or a very old and dear friend.  If you are on a first date and want the evening to continue...STAY AWAY.\n\nI had the gnocchi.  The portion was excellent as was the sauce.  I have written about the dangers of gnocchi in the past, and Parma understands what a gut buster this dish can be.  They keep the portion filling without being overwhelming.  I sampled my girlfriend's fettuccine bolognese.  The noodles were very, very good.  We finished off the meal with some Italian cheesecake.  Awesome!  Some of the best cheesecake I have had on the West Coast.  (It still is a mere shadow of my Nona's cheesecake, but it will suffice.)\n\nNext time you're walking down Steiner on the way to one of those other places, do yourself a favor and go to Parma instead.", "author": "Chris I."}

I'm skeptical about Italian restaurants that have stereotypically Italian decor-- the walls sponged to look old, the photos of Tuscany, the trailing ivy-- but this one happened to have an available table for two and we were starving, so we took a chance.  Good thing we did!  Service was quick and friendly.  The dining room was cozy on a cold and foggy night.  The food was divine.  \n\nI ordered the fettucine alla paplina, with peas and prosciutto in a cream sauce.  It was delicious-- the cream sauce was light, not too rich and didn't overwhelm the perfectly crisp and salty prosciutto and the tender peas.  My husband ordered the fusilli con pollo and remarked on the freshness of the pasta and wonderful flavor of the sauce.  We were both completely happy with our entrees.  I will say that I wish there was a better list of wines available by the glass here.  There were only a couple of options and the Pinot Grigio I reluctantly chose wasn't fantastic.

I had the lasagna bolognese (meat lasagna), and it was unquestionably the best lasagna I've ever had. Even half way through eating it, it was beautiful, with every layer still perfectly stacked on the plate, on my fork, and in my mouth. I was impressed by the visual of it, but don't worry, the thing you'll be most impressed with is are all the flavors. I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nBased on this meal alone, I think I can confidently say that Ristorante Parma is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nThe only fault I have with the place is that my water ran out and was not replaced.

Admittedly the seating area is a bit small and they don't take reservations so it could take over an hour to get a seat but it's absolutely worth the wait. But beware, the amount of garlic that you will consume here may kill you or at least any vampires you know, and maybe even a few friends. \n\nThe pros:\n\n1) Staff - I think it's family-owned. The daughters are the wait staff, the father walks around the restaurant and does the owner duties -- chatting with patrons, being social, being happy, being fun. The ladies do a wonderful job at making sure everything is as needed and they are on top of their game. If you need something, they get it for you, no questions asked.\n2) Atmosphere - Fantastic. The crowd must help the ambience but it's just a lively, cozy feel in there.\n3) Food - Delicioso...I cannot explain how delish it is. Everything was so good starting from the bread and their garlic oil dipping sauce to the entrees. We had a large party so we ordered quite a variety of things and everything was perfectly made and so flavorful -- no dish was lacking in rich flavor and texture (in case you want to know what we ordered, go to the bottom of my review -- I don't want to bore everyone else who doesn't care!)\n4) Prices - For the food you get, the atmosphere you're in, the staff, their prices are pretty good.\n\nThe cons:\n1) Parking - it is very, very difficult to find parking in that area. They do have a parking lot that charges a flat $10 fee nearby though if you're willing to cough it up. \n2) Wait - since they don't take reservations the wait can get long. But we arrived with a group of 8 and a baby @ 6pm and we just made it before it got super busy. They say that they get busy around 7-7:30 so if you can make it around 6, you'll be okay with the wait time.\n\nThis is definitely a must try!! I am coming back soon!\n\nWhat we ordered:\nBruschetta - very good. Grilled/baked to perfection with just the right amount of olive oil & tender tomatoes.\nLasagna - huge portions, very cheesy and saucy, just the way I like it.\nEggplant parmigiana (or something along those lines) - Not bad, resembled the lasagna in presentation but not something I'd probably get again only b/c I enjoy my meat.\nSpaghetti w/ Sausages - the sauce was amazing, lacked large chunks of sausage but had a good amount of ground sausage scattered around.\nSalmon & Asparagus Penne - sooo good. The cream sauce is to die for, the smoked salmon has just the right amount of saltiness to balance the creaminess, the pasta, and the tender asparagus stalks. Amazing!\nSeafood Spaghetti - very good. The sauce is fantastic, making the seafood taste divine. The clams and mussels were cooked to just the right level so they're not rubbery but not raw.\nChicken Corkscrew Pasta - pretty good, a darker sauce and a little saltier than the others but still very tasty and balanced.", "author": "Ellen C."}

The sauce was more like a marinara, the garlic tasted like it may have been partially from a jar and it was clearly over sauteed.\n\nCaesar Salad - the \"salad for 2\" consists of 2 small plates of caesar-dressed romaine.  No croutons.  No anchovies.  $14.95.  Ouch.  \n\nBottle of Sangiovese - was quite good though I don't recall the vintage.\n\n\nIf you can't distinguish b/w good and bland Italian food, you'll likely find this place acceptable however, if you have higher expectations, you'll be disappointed.", "author": "Jason K."}

However, my friend told me about this restaurant and I decided to give a try. Surprisingly, I can affirm that the best lasagna is here! Do not look for it any more because it's not going to happen. These are big words because I really don;'t even like lasagna. The sauce that comes with this dish at Parma really makes the lasagna literally melt in your mouth. They have a few other good items too, however, they do not get even close to the one I mentioned. The garlic pizza is a good option too and for dessert make sure to get the Tiramisu. It is their finest dessert. After my first experience I decided to try it again, I took with me a big group of picky eaters and they said the restaurant was good but not as good as I said it was going to be. I do not know whether it was me the one who was exaggerating or if it's them that whine about everything. During my second time I had the spinach salad and for main course the Gnochi. Both were superfresh and service was friendly and warm as usual. They saw we were starving and really tried to get us a table quickly (those are the things that matter!). It is a very good bet for a nice inexpensive dinner, other restaurants offer similar food quality but the prices are different.

There are plenty of fake Italian restaurants in the area, so it was slightly disappointing that the menu did not feature more challenging dishes: it's not as though authentic Italian is particularly weird - it's just that they use slightly different (tastier/less bland) ingredients and slightly different preparations from what has become the US standard.

Pretty small but still doesn't feel cramped.  I did go a little early on a Monday night so it was not very crowded.  I am giving four stars for the interior feel, food and location to my house.  \n\nI had the gnocchi with a tomato sauce.  This was the first time i have ever tried gnocchi so don't really have anything to compare it to, but i thought it was quite good.  I could not finish the serving (which is unlike me) because it was very filling.  My girlfriend went with the fettucini alfredo.  I gave it a little bite and thought it was great.  Next time i would most likely go for that dish since at home we don't eat creamy sauces very often.  \n\nMy dad picked a wine for us that was very good and our glasses never went empty with the waiter being attentive without being OVER attentive.  The service staff as a whole was not particularly friendly but in no way rude.    The dipping sauce for the break was excellent but as others have said very garlicky.  When we ordered dessert my dad wanted some coffee but for some reason they were completely out even though it was only 7:30pm.  \n\nThe \"ruins\" interior could have been cheesy but it wasn't.  Overall, I chose this place for its location and would go there again for some good filling Italian food.", "author": "Alex G."}

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the whole experience.\n\nThoughts:\n\n1. Carbonara is an inherently sinful dish.  This was some of the driest I've ever had, without that lusciously creamy, delicious, calorie-laden coating one expects.  I got the feeling they were trying to make a low calorie version, which just doesn't work.  Some things are meant to be guilty pleasures, and carbonara is one of them.\n\n2.  The walls were full of dust bunnies.  Look in some of the holes in the walls - holes right next to your face as you're eating -  and you will quite honestly see rather large clumps of dust.  The biggest I saw was about the size of my thumbnail.  Gross.\n\n3.  Hideous fake flowers?  In San Francisco?  Seriously?\n\n4.  The oil/balsamic/garlic dip for the bread at the beginning was really good.\n\nOverall, I was completely underwhelmed.

The Tortellini della Nonna is veal and cheese stuffed tortellini in a light cream sauce with pancetta. Totally rich and a bit of indulgence for me, but it was worth it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-30", "description": "Amazing experience here!! Arguably the best Italian spot I've tried in the city (so far).\n\nFirst of all, the owner/organizer is really a character, he definitely looks like one of these Italian guys from the 1960s you could have found in Southern Italy at the time. He is the right mix of being warn and direct you do really expect to find in Italians!\n\nMy friend and I were so happy with the food there. OK, we had to wait 40 mins to get a spot, but guys, it was Saturday night and we had no reservation. No worries anyway, we just had to move two doors  down Steiner St. and get a decent glass of wine at Nectar, which is a really classy wine bar, especially on Saturdays. \n\nOnce we got our table, we immediately ordered a Carpaccio and a bottle of their Chianti Classico by Antinori: I really loved the berries flavor in the wine, as well as its profoundness and corposity (is this the right word in English??). No surprise, given that was a DOCG wine, i.e. the highest rank you can have for wines in Italy - just consider we had two terrible wines for the same price (around $40) in other restaurants. \nThe Carpaccio was also really good, exactly the way you get it from your grandma in Tuscany, although maybe people abroad prepare it differently: capers, aurugula and lemon, great job! While eating our Antipasto, we couldn't avoid staring at the two ladies sitting next to us, who ordered some pasta which really looked amazing! They were also complainig claiming we were speaking too loud... maybe nex time they just want to stay home to avoid other customers chatting while having their food!\nAnyway, our expectations for Lasagne were really high!\n\nWe fortunately had some bread and our olive oil/vinaigrette dip, which was quite tasty - my friend was eating the whole onion/garlic part of it and loved it, although he afterwards kept complaining he had too much of a garlic smell in his breath...\n\nFortunately, Our Lasagna was much better than the most positive expectation we could have. The pasta was clearly handmade, the perfect balance between thick and fresh which really makes a Lasagna great. The meat sauce was also very good indeed (although maybe it should have been cooked a bit longer, just to avoid the crisp flavor you taste when it's too fresh). The upper surface was crispy and well done as you never find it around. Finally, the parmesan cheese they offer you is really fresh and tasty. \nWe also got an espresso, and the owner was kind enough to offer us some Cantuccini to finish our bottle of wine.  \n\nService was impeccable. Our waiter was very helpful indeed, he had helpful insights on the menu and we were really happy to be served in such a considerate way. Needless to say, he is an Italian guy. I have to admit, it's probably one of the first times I feel like they deserve the tip you give them when paying your bill!\n\nI do really look forward to being back at Ristorante Parma and trying some of their other Pastas next time, and possibly their Tiramisu too!", "author": "france d."}

However, this was a really bad experience.  My friend was visiting the bay area on business and wanted to meet me for dinner.  I found this place on Yelp and told her to meet me here.  By the time I had gotten to the restaurant she had already been there for 15 minutes and the service was off to a bad start.  She told me the staff was rude and unwelcoming and she had to stop someone to order a drink since no one had acknowledged her yet.  I hoped things would improve and thought maybe they just wanted to wait for the rest of the dinner party.  Not so much.  We sat there without drinks for about 10 minutes.  No one apologized or said they would be with us as quickly as they could.  It was really strange...the place was not that busy, so that was not the problem.  Everyone just seemed to have a general apathetic attitude regarding service.  When bread was finally brought to our table, the man who gave it to us did not smile, make eye contact, or even seem to notice we were sitting there.  We flagged down a server and finally ordered drinks and food.  When the food arrived, luckily, my friend was really pleased with the veal dish she ordered.  I would have felt terrible recommending this place had her meal been on par with the service.  I was underwhelmed with the gnocchi I ordered.  It tasted a lot like spaghetti-o's to me.  I actually like spaghetti-o's, but  would rather not pay $9.00 for them.  Oh, the bread with olive oil, balsamic, and garlic was good once we finally received it from the crabby man...2 stars for that alone.  I just don't have the heart to give a 1 star review.  I'm not sure that I would give this place another chance...it was too much work.", "author": "Beth J."}

Follow the advice of others here by going light on the garlic-parsley dipping sauce. It is incredible, but can be very overpowering and linger on into your dinner...and then breakfast.", "author": "Joe I."}

Being a resident of Chestnut street for over a year, I'm not hating - I'm just being honest.\n\nIt was not long ago that I discovered Cafe Parma and became a FAN.  From the very first time that I was waiting for my friends, when the waitress automatically brought me a glass of wine, without my asking....to each time I return and they smile saying - \"I know you!\" - without saying is a pleasant experience.\n\nThis restaurant is family owned, family run and has family food made to your desire...want it more spicy, less spicy? just let them know...the bread is brought out with a wonderful olive oil dip that is just delicious!  I literally could eat her everyday!!!  Good thing I'm a \"endurance athlete\" so I can!\n\nDefinitely give it a try...not the Marina vibe that you may be expecting, in fact  a very mellow, delicious place!", "author": "Anu G."}

The fusilli con pollo and the penne with smoked salmon and asparagus is what we get every time. Food is always great, never varys. The portions are just right and the bread (with it's great balsamic vinegar / oil / diced garlic) is terrific.  When we lived in the city we were here a few times a month, now that we moved, we try to get there once every other month. Best Italian food we have ever had! The wait at the door is worth this food, DO NOT go down the street to E Angelo, that place is gross and the waiters are slow and rude!", "author": "Elisa L."}

It has a charming interior and the Italian man who owns the place is always very welcoming, and makes me feel like I'm back in Italy. The wine is great -- the server will always recommend a great bottle (not top price). I had the most delicious pasta dish that had the perfect kick to it. It's good for groups of 4 or less, or even to grab some take out and enjoy at home in front of a movie. The owner will even chat with you while you wait. Oh, try not to sit too close to the door, cause when it's crowded, you'll feel like people are standing at your table (waiting for a table to open up), and when the door opens, you'll be chilled with a big gust of wind.", "author": "Janel A."}

The minestrone soup is also delicious along with everything else that I've tried.  Parma is a small restaurant with a cozy San Francisco feel. They don't take reservations or names at the door, but the owner has impeccable timing and has always seated us within the time we were quoted.  I frequently bring out of town guests to Parma, but it's definitely better suited for small parties.", "author": "Katherine D."}

The wait staff is very attentive and helpful, however, the food didn't live up to the reviews of other yelpers. I tried the gnocchi with red sauce and while it had a great pillowy texture, it tasted really floury and off. I tried the penne arrabiata and it was just alright. I expected more from this restaurant and I not sure I'll return.", "author": "Stephanie B."}
