At first glance at the menu, I was even questioning if it was really Italian (never seen sauerkraut on an  Italian menu!). My new/old lady friend chose it as she wanted somewhere quiet to talk. It was so quiet we could hear neighbour's hushed conversations; and they, ours! In fact we ended up chatting to a nice pair of elderly women who were having a convivial night out.\nThe history of the place is on the back of the menu so that's where one learns that this place has its roots on the Croatian peninsula, in land that is no longer Italian.\nThe menu reflects that, but does still have Italian flavours: gnocchi, for example, served in a cumin-laced sirlin sauce that was worth scraping off the plate with the crispy bread! I shared my friend's appetizer and she, mine: i had the cold sardines. Could have used a little more flavour but she enjoyed having mad the better choice.\nHaving overcome my scepticism about sauerkraut in Italian food, I went for the pork loin stuffed with it; very tasty with perfect consistency and a ggod blend of flavours. I also got a taste of the strudel (pasta, not pastry) as we shared dishes. Also highly recommended. Digging into a long lost past, i chose a glass of very  pleasant chianti and that reminds me of the only flaw I can find: the head waiter's English was a ltle tough to understand. And, if he didn't understand us, he just walked off!\nSomehow (perhaps at the urging of our new neighbours - from whom we learned there is no corkage fee, as  they left us some of their wine!) we found room to share the tiramisu; light and whelming with various, distinct tastes. I think this place might have been on the Chronicle's top  100 one; like the Cavalier, it deserves to be reinstated.", "author": "Michael A."}

My friend and I split the salmon, it was cooked fine but boring with a few steamed veggies on the plate. We had the 3 cheese ravioli with brown butter sauce - the ravioli were ok, butter sauce was good but there was a LOT of rough chopped fresh sage all over the pasta which was very bitter and inedible. I told the waiter and he graciously took it off the bill. Strudel was dreadful. The filling was over sweet with too much cinnamon and the dough was heavy - I couldn't eat it (rare for me).\n\nSeemed like either an uninspired or inexperienced chef was at the helm tonight. \n\nQuite disappointed.", "author": "Deborah N."}

I had called about an hour in advance and we were able to get a table at 8:30pm. When Uber dropped us off in a very residential neighborhood, I wasn't sure if we were in the right place. It took a moment to spot the restaurant. By the time we got to the restaurant, all of the other tables were finishing up. We were one of the last groups of the day.\n\nThere was only one server and he was busy calculating other people's checks, making coffee, and delivering dishes. It took a few minutes for us to get seated and quite a bit longer before he came to get our order. In the meantime, we read all about the history of the restaurant and Istria.\n\nWe ordered the braised veal shank and mushroom risotto. The veal looked beautiful and it was fall-off-the-bone tender. For some reason, it wasn't as tasty (flavorful) as I had imagined it would be. The risotto about 50% mushrooms, which was way more than I had expected. If you're a big mushroom fan, I'd recommend this dish.\n\nI like the old-school setting and the homey feeling. But really, it was a  3.5* experience.", "author": "Yi Z."}

You get 8 to an order and they're a pretty good siZe - nice for sharing. \n- shrimp & mussels risotto & I think there were some scallops in there . Perfectly cooked risotto !

Being part Italian, and growing up in an area where there was no shortage of outstanding Italian restaurants, this was very comparable to the quality of food I've grown up with. \n\nWhen you walk in here, you may get the feeling you are going to be taken care of- 'CAUSE YA WILL. It's funny, our party of five at roughly 4:30p was greeted with an \"Oh I'm sorry I don't think we can seat you tonight.\" We looked around... then to each other... and each of us gave the look like \"Are ya serious guy? There's no one in here!\". After walking into the back and checking his reservations, he assured us that he could get us seated with a short wait as a table had cancelled. After only 5mins we were seated. He was very apologetic. This was a running joke at the table for the next hour or so, but by the time we left, that joke was on us- THIS PLACE WAS SLAMMED! GET THE RESERVATION!\n\nOnce seated, Sam took care of us completely. Great guy. Always attentive and polite. We wanted an order of the stuffed squid as an appetizer but noticed an odd quantity for our party, he said don't worry, I'll take care of it. Sure enough, they brought out just the right amounts.\n\nThe food quality was great. My notable dishes were the Taierini con gamberetti e vongole and the Strudel con pasta fatta in casa. Much like most places around the bay area, of course you can't go wrong with any of the seafood options here. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente, sauces were very tasty.\n\nThe atmosphere here was another great attribute. Very small and quaint.

It had great reviews and it was close to our hotel.  We made a reservation online which was easy.   Since sitting it took 1hr and 15 minutes prior to receiving our meal.  I ordered the stuffed Lasagna, my wife the spaghetti and friend the filet mignon.  Slightly annoyed that the restaurant was understaffed and I could tell by the waiters attitude.  He seemed flustered and genuinely fake.  This was noted when a couple did not leave a tip and he slightly pouted when they left and ran outside to look at them.  After multiple water refills and a complimentary mushroom soup.  We received our food.  Food was great, but should have been since the food was $10 more than what yelp lists.  \n\nFinally at the end I asked the waiter kindly if he could split our check.  Mind you we only have three people and he only needed to remove my friends steak from our check.\" And the one of the last two tables in the restaurant (everyone had left). He irritatingly said \"you should have asked me before hand!??\" Pouted and walked away.  At that point I was mad and about to lash back.  But I kept it in.  It didn't help when he was giving us the angry look while looking at his POS machine.  He finally came back, I cooled off and I said thank you.  All he did was grimace.  \n\nI'm thoroughly disappointed by this experience.  It's unfortunate that the waiter could destroy the reputation of this restaurant because of his attitude.

The rabbit was served with a delicious rosemary polenta that we enjoyed. The steak was definitely the best dish of the night. However, there were also some dishes that were big misses too. The tomato soup was bland, the seafood risotto was tasteless & the seafood pasta was a huge disappointment. The pasta lacked taste & any type of sauce. We all shared many desserts and once again there were hits & misses. The Tarimsu was very good. Light & not to much rum flavor.

A wonderful meal and thoughtful birthday touches made my night even more special.  The first diners to arrive, we were a bit unsure of our choice, but not for long. Our Host could not have been more gracious,  making us feel welcome immediately and bringing us each a glass of champagne to start the celebration while we perused the menu. So many delicious choices! Although the menu is an omnivore's delight, I'm pescetarian, and ordered a delicious homemade ravioli filled with three cheeses, pine nuts, golden raisins, and freshly ground nutmeg. There were 2 choices for sauce, and I can't pass up browned butter and sage - so rich, but so yummy! My son had a perfectly cooked beef filet, and even *gasp!* ate most of the veggies served with it. We couldn't linger, as we had a show to catch, but our kind host quickly brought another surprise birthday treat to end our meal - and didn't delay us. Such gracious, thoughtful service seems to be disappearing in many places, but I suspect it will live on here for some time.

Sam, the chef and owner, was extremely pleasant and made us feel right at home. He immediately brought over 2 glasses of complimentary proseco to welcome us along with some hot bread. Started off with the mushroom soup and stuffed calamari in a marinara sauce with fresh basil.  The fresh marinara coupled with the basil made for a very refreshing taste. Now on the the main course...  I ordered the seafood stew which was filled with white fish, shrimp, calamari, scallops, clams, and mussels all in a nice nice brown sauce. Artecia had a mushroom risotto which she asked Sam to add scallops and extra garlic (as she put it... when you think it's too much add more). Both dishes had great presentation and came with an explosion of flavors to make for a happy pallet. Finished with an apple strudel and a scoop of ice cream (apples, raisins and nuts). The tiramisu was smooth, desiccant, an beautiful in the words of Artecia.  Overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend this place. It has a great atmosphere and food to match. Hope to cross paths with Sam and his amazing culinary creations in the near future!", "author": "R C."}

It is absolutely worth every 5 star rating. From the outside, you could easily pass it by. Inside is old school San Francisco, with amazing food.\n\nWe started with a salad and gnocchi - the salad was good... but the gnocchi? WOWZERS! imagine little balls of mashed potatoes, delicately fried & then plated in a beef gravy. Yeah - it's something dreams are made of.\n\nI ordered the proscuitto streudel with b\u00e9chamel - it was like nothing I've ever had. Served like a lasagna, just amazing. Hubby ordered the raviolis with 2 sauces - and again, amazing. Service was great, food was fantastic. Forget Bimbos, we will come back here often!\n\nI wish they had a liquor license, but their wine list was reasonable & the bottle we ordered delish.

If he were writing this review, he would give Albona five stars and maybe more.\n\nWe both found the asparagus soup was a very special dish. It was not cream based but still creamy in taste and texture.\n\nDH's lamb chops were thick and tasty. Easy to have a clean plate even with a generous serving.\n\nI did not want a large entree so opted for the pasta \"strudel\" which was quite cheesy but a bit too salty for my taste.\n\nTo end our pleasant meal we shared a delicious homemade apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Every bit as good as what my Bohemian MIL used to make.  DH had a complimentary dish of gelato (with a candle!) to recognize his birthday.  Nice touch.  Espresso was good.\n\nThe wine list was interesting.  A little hard to choose as we were not familiar with the Italian wines.  And to complicate things, several of the wines on the list were no longer available.\n\nWe dined on a Tuesday evening and when we arrived at 7:30 there were only a few other customers.  Several more parties arrived later.\n\nService was friendly and professional.  While overall we liked the ambiance of the restaurant, there were a few things that caused me to drop a star.  The wine menu was not up-to-date and had stains on it as did the main menu. Also one of the banquette benches was badly worn ... leather seat was torn and very ratty looking.  Fortunately we were not seated there as I would have been uncomfortable.", "author": "Elaine P."}

I was nervous about getting seated around 7pm on a Thursday night without a reservation, but the friendly host found a table for us. \n\nNote:  they STRONGLY recommend having a reservation.  The dining room is very small, so this recommendation makes sense.  \n\nThe menu is short, but throughout showcasing Istrian cuisine.  What exactly is that? Yeah, I had to look it up too.  Istria is near Croatia and shares cultural aspects from  Croatia, Slovenia and Italy.  \n\nNot only were we greeted by the friendly host and later our server, an actual chef came out to visit with us!  He was very welcoming and gladly answered any questions we had about the menu.  He actually talked me out of of getting a pasta dish and encouraged me to go for something more \"adventurous\".  I really enjoyed the personal perks of our dining experience.  \n\nWe started our meals with the Insalata mista and picia salads.  Both were excellent.  Although it may be too pungent for some, I specifically enjoyed the truffle vinaigrette in the picia salad.  \n\nFor my main entree I ordered the Polo impana con salsa de capori, a pan-seared breaded chicken dish.  It was excellent, but since it was fried, it was a tad bit oily.  The chicken was finished off with a light, tasty caper sauce. Mashed potatoes accompanied the chicken and were creamy perfection.  A small side of perfectly steamed broccoli florets accented the chicken and mashed potatoes.  \n\nMy dining partner ordered the Strudel con pasta fatta in casa.  This rich lasagna-like dish was excellent.  \n\nWe finished the meal with Bonet, a dark chocolate and amaretto flan.  It was outstanding!  \n\nThe portion sizes were quite generous and we both had doggy bags to take home.  \n\nThis is a very special place to share a intimate and unique meal tucked away in a quiet neighborhood street away from the hustle and bustle of North Beach.   I strongly recommend it!", "author": "Andrea H."}

Its brightly lit inside - I would suggest dimming the lights and putting candles at each table. \n\nThe menu was provided to us on legal-sized paper.  We had to ask for the wine list, it was another (slightly more wrinkled) piece of paper.  There were a handful of wines to choose from, but a very simple list overall. \n\nI ordered the \"Peto de Polo con salsa de rosmarin\".  It is essentially a roasted free-range chicken breast sitting in a sherry and rosemary sauce.  There are roasted potatoes, carrots and zucchinis surrounding the chicken in the sauce.  The quantity of sauce was plentiful - it was a bit of a bath.  I give the dish a B in terms of both flavor and plating. \n\nThe service was fairly good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nOn the plus side, street parking in the area is available for those willing to walk a couple blocks.  And all of their desserts are made in-house which is impressive for a small establishment.", "author": "Joel B."}

We ate here a few years ago and remembered liking it but haven't been back since.  Since we had last minute  guests visiting SF and they really wanted Italian food in North Beach, we thought we would take them to Albona.\n\nLucky for us, We were able to make reservations for 6 people at 6:30 on a Saturday last minute.  The venue is fairly small but cozy and had ambiance.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered \"grandmothers specialty\" pan fried gnocchi in brown sirloin sauc laced with cumin.  The flavors were so distinct and almost a Mediterranean flavor.  The gnocchi was tender and melted in your mouth.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the risotto with mushrooms and it was delightful.  Chunks of crimini and porcini mushrooms, perfectly cooked risotto and not too saucy.   My husband had the ravioli with three cheeses, pine nuts, and golden raisins in a fried sage and butter sauce.  The filling for the ravioli was so meaty I thought there was meat in it.  It tasted so good!\n\nFor dessert, I finished my meal with a 10 year Graham's tawny port.", "author": "Maria V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-07", "description": "Albona is a cute little mom and pop Italian Restaurant nestled in Nob Hill, away from the main drag. I had my doubts because most of the Italian joints in this neighborhood are extremely touristy and overhyped. While Albona was a cute, traditional place for dinner, it wasn't a destination and catered alot to the older crowd. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the 5 star reviews came from loyal neighborhood patrons, because the service was so wonderful. Perhaps if you are one of those Noe Valley Italian Restaurant 5-star reviewers, you may like this as well.\n\nIt was my anniversary, and the manager brought out complimentary champagne. He offered complimentary dessert also when I made the reservation over the phone (they're hard to get a hold of!), but dessert already came with my Travelzoo Voucher ($69 for 3-courses for 2 people - what a steal!). Surprisingly, there were no restrictions on the menu for which 3 courses to select. Typically, restaurants will limit you to the lower priced items and/or make you share dishes. Great deal but note: they include tax/gratuity on the full price of the meal. \n\nI was disappointed with the quality of the food overall, if I were to return it would merely be to rule out some potential dishes I didn't try. Some things I wish I had ordered instead were the mussels (appetizer), rabbit, any pasta, chocolate flan and panna cotta. \n\n* COMPLIMENTARY BREAD ROLLS (2 STARS):\nNo points docked here, I'll take free carbs any day! The rolls were however quite a disappointment, they felt warm but stale like they were store bought, a bit stale and reheated in the microwave. The hard butter tore this roll apart.\n\n* CALAMARI AL FORNO CON SALSA MARINARA (2 STARS) - $12: \nThree medium sized squid, stuffed with toasted bread crumbs, parsley, and garlic; roasted in marinara sauce. I squeezed the stuffing out, did not like the bread crumb heavy stuffing and the sauce tasted very... prego like. Overall I was very disappointed because I love squid!\n\n* CAPUZI GARBI CON PROSUTO E LUGANEGA (2.5 STARS) - $12: \nBraised sauerkraut with onions, apples and prosciutto with 3 halves of italian sausage. The waiter recommended against this because it has a strong pickled flavor, but I couldn't resist because I love sausage! I thought the sausage was OK, salty and dense - underwhelming for $12. I much prefer Rosamunde's ovepriced dogs.\n\n* COSTOLETTE DE ANIEL (4 STARS) - $30:\nRack of Lamb with Dijon mustard & herb crust served with a potato, eggplant and pesto napoleon. I enjoyed the rack of lamb, at a price point of $30 I would definitely get it again considering the famed Kokkari rack costs a whopping $42, although it is still not cheap. \n\n* INVOLTIN DE PORCO CON CAPUZI GARBI E PROSUTO (2 STARS) - $27:\nPork loin stuffed with sauerkraut, prosciutto, apples, and plums served with red cabbage saut\u00e9. The pork was a bit salty, dry... nothing about this was redeeming except it was a decently sized portion that could fill you up. \n\n* STRUDEL DE POMI (2 STARS) - $8:\nApple strudel with cinnamon, pine nuts, and golden raisins with vanilla ice cream (plus $3 = $11). This dessert was OK, but reminded me of the frozen desserts at Safeway that you bake at home, or a buffet. Supposedly these are all homemade desserts but I was quite unimpressed, perhaps it would have been better with a flaky butter crust instead?\n\n* TIRAMISU (2 STARS) - $8:\nThis tiramisu was soaked way too much in rum. Huge pet peeve of mine. The cake became grossly soggy and squishy, and there was not enough marscapone cream to balance it all out. I regretted ordering this and wished I had ordered the panna cotta and the dark chocolate flan instead.", "author": "Jess C."}

Service is great, food is unique and savory, atmosphere is very homey - You feel like you're eating in someone's home dining room, very intimate.\n\nCame on a slow sunday evening. The owner/head chef (of 18 years!) walked us through the menu and told us the specials before the main service started. I went with the stuffed pork loin (bomb) and my uncle had the veal shank.

For my belated birthday, he said, \"I found this restaurant not far from my house. I've never been there before. I wanted something that is not sushi.\" Hmmm.. Did he read my tumblr piece that amply named \"Sushi boat restaurant and men who loved sushi\"? Or did he read my inner monologue of \"I can't do sushi any more!\" when another friend who wanted to go for sushi last Friday suggested Ebisu and I had such a strong allergic reaction to it (Yes he and I went there 16 years ago) that I almost punched that other friend who had absolutely no idea why I was so upset. \n\nWell, Italian it is, except - it was not. It's Istrian, it's technically Croatian food. As I walked into the restaurant and I was thinking, hmmm.. a bit quiet, let's hope the food would be good. Well, the food was good, it was excellent. I went straight for sauerkraut and rabbit. Interesting execution on the sauerkraut which is wrapped in pancetta and served on the side is sausage. Very interesting. I trust Michael Bauer and he likes it here, eight years straight.\n\nAfterwards I did research and I found that it is the only Istrian restaurant in the west coast. I like one of a kind of things. I blindly trust my dining partner's taste. He's got fantastic taste, both in culinary and fashion. This came to be such an experience. - it's one of a kind restaurant. \n\nTried his lamb chop, it seemed fried, but very tender and tasty. I was busy telling stories and he was just smiling the whole time, laughing at my not funny jokes. I thought to myself, it must be something in the dishes because I'm really funny. You can tell when the restaurant knows its service because the wait staff came to check our progress and was staying in the background because I was on a roll telling not so funny stories (note to self: I will indeed keep my day job.) Then when we had absolutely no room for dessert, they brought out some mouse cake - dessert on the house they said. It was good but too much food, we took a bite and had to call it a night.  But how wonderful they gave us dessert on the house! \n\nWhile eating the rabbit, I kept on thinking, given that this was one half rabbit, where did the other half go? Since it was not deboned, did I just east the leg or did I eat the arm? \n\nI have been looking for good rabbit for a long time. I also will take every opportunity I can to get sauerkraut. In conclusion, this restaurant serves weird but fantastical dishes - it's a bit of Italian, a bit of eastern European and a bit of Austrian / German. It's sophisticated and unusual, add on good quality food and excellent service, it's a five, through and through.", "author": "Victoria E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-08", "description": "The. Best. Dining. Experience. EVER.  Unique.  Memorable.  Unforgettable.  Exceptional.  Simply remarkable and sensational on every level you could imagine.\n  \nLocated off the beaten path, Albona was recommended by a friend of a friend.  I knew I HAD to dine here before leaving San Francisco.  I called first to make reservations and was told they were 'full'.  Nothing available.  I explained to the courteous man on the phone that I was from Chicago, heard great things about their restaurant, and that I was only in town for 1 more day.  I left my phone # and asked to be called in the event a table was available.\n\nI received a call later from the Manager the same day stating he had a table for 2 available as he was informed I was from Chicago and that he was more than happy to accommodate me. The conversation alone left a fond impression on me.  I was ecstatic to say the least and had no expectations going in...I was told this was a restaurant to check out, but never imagined the treasure I was about to discover.  I thought this was Italian, when in fact this cuisine is a combination of Italy, Croatia & Slovania known as Istrian.  \n\nWe cabbed it to Albona and upon entering the unassuming building off a quiet side street, I was taken by the very intimate and charming room.  It was rather small, but very comfortable.  My friend & I were seated immediately.  The waiter was outstanding.  As I stared at the menu consisting of everything 'tempting', I wanted to know what their specialty was.  What is on or off the menu that I should try?  (I always ask for suggestions whenever I'm 'new' to a cuisine).\nHe offered wonderful recommendations, including various wines.  This waiter was charming, engaging...and my girlfriend & I were thoroughly enjoying the banter...and flirting..\n\nAppetizer:  Grandmother's homemade fried potato gnocchi in a brown meat sauce w/cumin. Calamari al forno (stuffed w/bread crumbs) in marinara.  Before receiving our app's, the manager came over to greet us, and poured our wine.  He was so friendly, we couldn't stop talking as he came to check on us often...we loved his attention..(he was really, really cute too...I could literally just talk about *him*, but...) onto the food.  The gnocchi was nothing like a traditional pasta gnocchi.  These were more like round morsels of fried dough.  Very much like pieces of panzerotti dough made with potatoes (that's exactly what this reminded me of).  In fact, I even mentioned this to Mike (Manager).  He smiled when I said that, but wasn't going to 'give away any secrets'.  They were divine as was the complimenting sauce.  The squid was delicious as well.  Tenderly filled sitting in a tasty tomato sauce.\n\nFor entree's I went with the signature, Strudel con pasta fatta in casa (homemade).  Friend had the risotto con funghi.  Both were Mike's recommendation.  The strudel was much like a 'rotolo'. Baked with layers of lappi cheese, b\u00e9chamel, prosciutto, & tomato cream sauce.  Amazingly good.  The risotto was cooked perfectly.  Every dish was outstanding.\n\nAfter indulging in deliciousness and a bottle of wine later, Mike came by to bring us complimentary dessert...he asked what we'd like to have.  I was stuffed at this point and couldn't eat another bite, but he insisted.  He came back with 3 different desserts!!! Tiramisu, Bonet & Gelato.  All heavenly (not to mention Mike..;)  It was probably around 10 or 11pm as he sat with us, bringing out more wine, aperitif's, etc...etc...and the restaurant was now empty.  He was closing up, but yet we stayed - he insisted.  We weren't complaining. And the night went on, and on, and on..till around 1am!....we exchanged emails (yes, that's all we exchanged...sadly..).  \n\nI will never forget Albona's or Mike.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect trip (if only he didn't already have a girlfriend ((who happened to stop in & sit with us also))....double *sigh*...).\nI love you San Francisco...", "author": "Nancy L."}

We had never been for Istrian food, and wanted something representative.  Sam was ready with recommendations to their top dishes.  And fear not vegetarians!  There are plenty of fine choices for you and Sam was very accommodating, even offering to put together a little two-dish sampler special for my wife.  \n\nI started with the gnocchi in sirloin sauce, \"grandma's specialty\"  It is not to be missed.  Light-as-a-cloud little dumplings in a hearty gravy with just a touch of cumin.  My wife tried some un-sauced parts of the gnocchi, and loved them.  Next time we will ask if they have a vegetarian alternative sauce for her.  But I will still get a second one for me with that awesome cumin sirloin sauce.  She had the peperonata and it was fresh, fragrant and very tasty.  \n\nFor our mains, she had a half order each of the penne and an off-the-menu vegetarian version of their mushroom risotto.  Both were excellent!  We would especially would recommend the risotto, it was just perfectly done.  I ordered the veal shank with polenta.  It was very nice too, beefy, succulent, comfort food.  \n\nDessert was the apple strudel, which was nice and tasty but came out too hot, like nuclear hot!  It took a long time to cool to an edible temperature.  We also ordered the panna cotta.  Rich, and creamy, it was our favorite of the two desserts.", "author": "Joe P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-23", "description": "Leave it to my erudite friends Jonathan and Syd to find the hidden culinary jewels in this city. After all, they were the ones who introduced me to the charming La Ciccia in outer Noe Valley a few years back, and we went to another out-of-the-way Italian restaurant halfway between North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf called Albona. Whereas La Ciccia is purely Sardinian, Albona is decidedly Istrian. Istrian? Yeah, I didn't know where Istria was either until I looked at their website afterward. It's a town in Croatia south of Trieste, which is on Italy's eastern border next to Slovenia. Confused? Me too, but the food is not confusing. It's quite stellar as a matter of fact - primarily northern Italian dishes with a definite Eastern European accent and a slight Mediterranean twang.\n\nIt's a tiny place but not terribly difficult to make a reservation. Despite its stellar Yelp ratings, Albona keeps an awfully low profile in a city full of obsessive foodies. They offer free valet parking which they tell you when they confirm your reservation. After working a decade under the tutelage of founder Bruno Viscovi, chef Samuel Hernandez took over the kitchen three years ago. Now I have no idea if the quality of the dishes wavered in the transition, but judging from what we ordered, I have to believe Bruno would be quite pleased. We started by sharing a couple of their appetizers. First up was the $9 Chifeleti de Mia Nona con Sugo de Carne al Cumin (Pan-fried Potato Gnocchi in Brown Sirloin Sauce with Cumin - see photo).  They bill it as \"grandmother's specialty\", and you could picture Bruno's grandma making the eight pillow-like gnocchi and sauteing them to a crispy brown.\n\nNext was the $12 Calamai al Forno con Salsa Marinara (Squid Stuffed with Toasted Bread Crumbs, Parsley, and Garlic Roasted in Marinara Sauce - see photo), which was surprisingly tender and hearty at the same time. Probably the most exquisite dish of the evening was the risotto - the $18 Risoto Vegetariano con Zaferan (Risotto Peas and Saffron Threads) - so melt-in-your-mouth delicious with just the right consistency and freshness (see photo). We then shared a pasta that sounded too tempting not to try - the $19 Strudel con Pasta Fatta en Casa, which were fresh pasta rolls stuffed with baked prosciutto and lappi cheese baked with toasted bread crumbs in a bechamel and tomato-cream sauce as a casserole (see photo). It was a bit like manicotti but much silkier in texture with a nice savory flavor to contrast with the dairy.\n\nOf course, we needed to try one of their entrees, and we landed on their $29 Stufato di Agnello (Lamb with Vegetables Served in a Broth), where the lamb took the form of riblets, loin and sausage, all perfectly tender, mixed with root vegetables and zucchini squash and all of it in a broth infused with mustard, horseradish, lemon zest, and fresh thyme (see photo). It was the kind of comfort food you would expect to find on my dream farm in the Tuscan countryside if I happened to be an extraordinarily talented cook. We didn't want the meal to end, so we had to try one of their specialty desserts. We decided on the $8 Crema de Gelato, a frozen triple-cream vanilla gelato mousse with brandied cherries (see photo).\n\nDecadent enough on its own, but Chef Hernandez was feeling generous and gave us the Strudel di Pomi as a bonus, a genuine apple strudel with cinnamon, pine nuts and golden raisins dusted with powdered sugar (see photo). Needless to say, we were sated and quite proud of our team approach in trying out a good sampling of their specialties. Albona has been around for 23 years, but amazingly, I never had the unique pleasure of a dining experience here before. It's probably because it sits on an otherwise residential street looking very nondescript. Now that I know it does exist, I will need to come back for more of Bruno's grandma's home-style dishes.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...home-style dishes mixing culinary delights from Italy, Austria, Croatia and other nearby countries that end in a vowel, impeccably presented\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...compact but low-key and comfortable on a less-than-busy Sunday evening\nSERVICE - 5 stars...first-class with personal attention from Chef Hernandez\nTOTAL - 5 stars...now I know where Albona is!", "author": "Ed U."}

Ate here on a Friday night before a comedy show around the corner and let our server know that we were going to a show around 7:30 and he thanked us for letting us know, and our meal was perfect timed for our show. We started with some wine - my glass of chianti was very pleasant. Started with the small salad, and it was refreshing and tasty - lightly dressed with some nice veggies mixed in. But my entree... holy mother of pasta. I got the  stuffed baked pasta (strudel) with prosciutto, cheese, bread crumbs and fresh julienned basil on top... It was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The sides of the dish were a bit crispy where it had been baked which gave it great texture and mouth feel, and soft and gooey in the middle. Perfectly portioned too - it was very hearty, but not too big, so after I wolfed it down, I wasn't feeling too full. Very cute interior and great service.\n\nCan't wait to come back here, as I had one of my favorite dishes ever.", "author": "Sarah B."}

It couldn't. We made friends while waiting to be seated and we were warmly welcomed by Sam when we were seated. He picked up on my husband's last name and we were quickly acquainted and it felt like he was a celebrity since the owner Bruno is Croatian and Italian, too. \n\nWe started with a lovely bottle of white wine from the Amalfi Coast, enjoyed velvety mushroom soup, the house gnocchi - which is nothing like the Italian potato dumplings, but still tasty in their own right. Then, we stuffed ourselves silly on the fantastic lamb chops and scrumptious mushroom risotto. \n\nWhen they offered the dessert menu we couldn't possibly eat anymore, but they brought us their strudel to make up for their tardiness bringing the check.

I was afraid that as walk-ins we were not going to be able to get a dinner table, and I would have been correct if not for a bizarre situation. We were second in line out of three 2 person groups. The first group was arguing with the maitre d about having made a reservation while the maitre d insisted they had not. The maitre d said they had a table available anyways, yet the couple decided to leave. We snagged the table. The wait for the couple after us: 45 minutes. They also decided to leave. \n\nI was a bit concerned about the service given the exchange we had just witnessed, but service was really friendly and informative throughout. Strangely though, there were definitely open tables that could have been put to better use, so perhaps they have to improve their logistics. \n\nThe Istrain food was definitely different from what you typically expect from Italian. The potato 'gnocchi' were more akin to a different variety of dumplings and the cumin beef sauce they were served in was definitely unique, yet very tasty. \n\nThe seafood risotto was not bad, though not particularly wow-inducing either. Their homemade ravioli was simple, yet good. The panna cotta was also pretty good. \n\nOverall, I had a positive dining experience. From what we tried, perhaps the prices were a tad on the expensive side, but nothing out of the ordinary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-22", "description": "Don't get confused with Yelp's category of \"Italian\" for this restaurant - this is an Istrian establishment. (\"Istria? What is that? Oh, it's in Croatia. Oh so is this Croatian? Or is this a mix of Italian and Croatian and a billion other things because apparently there's strudels and saeurkraut on the menu\" - thoughts that ran in my head as I read the menu) Either way, the food here is good. Really good. Creepily good. Fantastically majestically good. \n\nIt was my mother's birthday and I had a reservation at \"Perbacca\" for a while until I last minute decided that it wasn't going to be her style. After doing some yelp-soul-searching, I discovered upon Albona and made a quick reservation for the night. We were lucky to find a parking rather quickly and descended upon this restaurant quickly as it was freezing outside. \n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\nIt was a small, intimate restaurant; not overly fancy but not too casual. The atmosphere was...I would say \"'polite\" but can you describe a restaurant as polite? There was classical music playing softly in the background which my dad absolutely loved. We're all classical music junkies in our family and it is rare to find a restaurant to be playing that. \n\nWHAT WE ORDERED:\n\nseasonal soup of the day (mushroom): I'm not a fan of mushroom. Like I will throw up if I even smell it. So...I didn't touch this. However, my mother (an avid mushroom lover - yack!) raved over this. Apparently, this mushroom soup was the best she's ever tasted.\n\ncalamai al forno con salsa marinara: squid stuffed with white fish, toasted bread crumbs, parsley, and garlic; roasted in marinara sauce. My god. This stuff is amazing. I'm used to eating fried calamari with marinara sauce and scarfing it down like a lunatic. This squid was fresh, chewy, NOT fried, stuffed with a delicious goodness of fish that didn't taste like fishy fish, it tasted like oh-this-is-good-what-is-this-magic fish mixed with other magical ingredients. One of my favorite dishes of the night.\n\ncatch of the day (halibut): this was my mother's order. I'm not quite too fond of halibut so I only had a bite or two. It was refreshing, light, and really well prepared. The execution was impressive because I feel like fish can go so wrong (maybe I just have bad experiences with smelly fishy fish and overcooked salmon).\n\nStrudel con pasta fatta in casa: I ordered this based on the rave reviews on Yelp. I normally wouldn't order this - prosciutto and lappi cheese in a pasta roll? That sounded a little too much, too rich for me. However, I ventured out of my comfort zone to try it. The strudel was definitely delicious and tasty, however I found it to be slightly too salty for my taste. It overwhelmed my taste buds and it was much too rich for me to finish by myself. I ate like about half of it and then boxed it for home. \n\nCostolette de Aniel: this was my dad's order and it was hands down, no argument here, the best dish of the night. It was a Rack of Lamb with Dijon mustard & herb crust served with a potato, eggplant and pesto napoleon. The lamb was perfectly executed and the best lamb I have ever tasted in the history of ever. My dad agreed and oh, boy, he has eaten a LOT of lamb. The sauce was perfect - very tasty without being overly salty. And the potatoes...ohhhhh the potatoes...\n\nstrudel de pomi: I always look forward to dessert, me being the sweet tooth that I am. Looking at the menu, i was quite disappointed with the selection, seeing nothing that looked particularly intriguing. I checked handy dandy Yelp and found that most people ordered the apple strudel. So, the strudel we got! And oh the strudel we loved. It wasn't mind blowingly phenomenal but it was good. Really good. The strudel was sweet and tart at the same time, warm and comforting. The gelato on the side was a nice touch (though definitely not worth the extra $3!)\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience. The waiters were attentive and friendly, always making sure our water was filled even though we had the bottle on our table. The ambiance was cozy and intimate. The bill turned out to be $145 with tip, which isn't too bad really for a birthday dinner. However, it is pricey if you're just stopping by for a quick dinner. A well deserved five stars.

We shared the arugula salad to start - I'm obsessed with arugula (particularly when paired with apples or pears), so this was an easy choice.  This salad was fabulous - delicious dressing that was full of flavor, but not too heavy.  The proscuitto was very tasty as well.  We also split the gnocchi app - which was okay, but we weren't a big fan (it wasn't what you'd think of as typical gnocchi - the texture was more like a \"tater tot\" as my husband would describe it.

It was completely different from the usual calamari we've had many times before.  It tasted fresh and delish!  For entree DH had the Stinco de videl a la Triestina (veal shank with polenta) and I had the Strudel con pasta fatta in casa (cannelloni with prosciutto and white sauce).  Both were to die for!  The meat on the veal was falling off the bone and the cannelloni were delicious (but wish the serving was a bit larger).  \n\nWhile we were waiting for our meal to come out we noticed the owner/head chef greeting other guests and reciting the specials.

He also helped clear out our dishes.  When we told him it was our first time and that we really enjoyed our meal he told us he's buying us dessert...gasp!  OMG!  How can we say no to that?  \nFor dessert we had the Tiramisu (moist and delicious) and Bonet (dark chocolate amaretto flan) it was different from any flan i've had before.  It isn't anything like a creme brulee..it is denser, creamier and \"stick to your hips\" type of thing.  It was worth every calories we ingested!\n\nIt was a wonderful dining experience from the servers to the head chef.\n\nA definite must visit whenever we're in the city.", "author": "Cossette P."}

They accommodated our group of five quite well, but I think anything more than six would be pushing it.\n\nOn our second visit, we ordered a bottle of wine that they turned out to be out of--so our server came out with three similarly-priced alternatives and let us choose from among them. I think that was pretty cool. And we ended up with a really excellent wine, to boot.\n\nThis is now my go-to Nice Italian Restaurant in North Beach. A great place for a romantic date, or just to have a classy dinner with visitors from out of town.", "author": "Greg P."}

The atmosphere of this cozy place was so lovely, and there was excellent service! The food is absolutely to die for!! I was in a big group, and the service was very impressive. The specials were fantastic, and the wine was also delicious. Many people in my group ordered the homemade lasagna. They said it was the best lasagna they ever had!   My father had the three cheese ravioli, and it had very interesting spices, such as nutmeg. The potions of the dinners were also perfect!The desserts were also fantastic. Tiramisu is definitely a recommendation!! But, the flan was not the best.

What did attract me there the very first time was the description about its intimate and family like setting, which I feel always hearty and missing about my days back in Europe. In addition, I'm very curious about what Istrian is really about. \n\nAlbona meet and exceed all our imagination and expectation. We love every aspect of our dinning experience there. The environment is warm and cozy with soft music in the background. Service is stellar! The waiters are professional and friendly, very knowledgeable and make us feel comfortable and relaxed. Food is so fresh and delicious! And the portion is big! We tried the grandmother specialty of pan fried potato gnocchi, braised veal shank and Brodeto. We were so full that we didn't have more room for desert. \n\nIt was such a memorable and pleasant experience that brought us back again last Wednesday. This time we ordered the Brodeto again, and tried the specially braised rabbit. We also enjoyed the stuffed squid and grandmother's specialty for appetizer, and finished with Tiramisu, coffee and tea. Again, we were full to divine. \n\nWe can't wait to go back  and try out rest of the menu!", "author": "Christine W."}

It's a small restaurant, I recommend making reservations. It's a bit non-descript from the outside, and if you weren't looking for it, you could easily pass it by.\n\nParking in the North Beach area can be challenging. You can try your luck at street parking, just be sure to carefully read any restriction signs. I would just bite the bullet and pay for parking.

I liked that very much and was looking forward to a great meal.  \n\nThen the waiter who doubles as the host asked if we had reservations.  We did not.  There were only two occupied tables, but waiter/host guy stood silently for a full 30 seconds, keeping us in suspense as he looked at a piece of paper.  Finally, he said he could seat us, but he was concerned about all the 7:00 reservations.  \n\nHe then sat us directly next to one of only two occupied tables in the place.  And the tables are very close together.  Seated directly next to me, less than a foot from my elbow, was a very obnoxious man who spoke non-stop about himself and how he knew so much about Italy because he had been there so many times.  He criticized each dish, made vulgar remarks to his dining companion, and bloviated about his superiority, making ridiculous comments about Naples, which is nowhere near the source of this restaurant's cuisine.  Then he decided to talk (and talk and talk) about tennis.  I don't know how he managed to eat anything.\n\nOf course, it was not the fault of the restaurant that this man was a popinjay, but they must have noticed it by the time we walked in, and seating us right next to him, when all but one other table in the place was empty, was indeed their fault.\n\nMy friend and I shared the fried gnocchi appetizer.  Glorified tater tots.  I would have preferred plain gnocchi.  Then I had the veal shank and polenta, which was fine but nothing special.  The bread served with the meal looked like institutional rolls.\n\nMeanwhile, I tried to ignore Mr. Ego, but he spoke as if he wanted everyone in the room to benefit from his wonderful life.  Perhaps he was overcompensating for his comb-over and the age difference between him and his dining partner.\n\nThere was no way I was going to have dessert, as I wanted to get away from the braying mule as soon as possible.  I paid cash so we wouldn't be there another minute waiting for my credit card to be processed.\n\nFor such a small place, it would have been nice to have interacted with one waiter throughout the night and learned a bit about the place.  Instead, host guy took our order, someone else brought it out, a third person cleared the table and oddly rearranged and then re-rearranged everything on the table, another person filled the water, and a girl we had never seen tried to take our dessert order. \n\nAnd when we left at 7:30, there was only one additional table in the place that was occupied!  \n\nWhen we finally got outside, my friend and I busted up about the pompous boor at the next table and walked through North Beach.  Neither of us mentioned the food.\n\nBe aware that this place is right across the street from a large housing project.", "author": "Bay G."}

I bought a Bloomspot deal for a 4-course meal for two, and I finally had my chance when I made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday, but I found it to be... only ok.\n\nWe started with the pan fried gnocchi and stuffed calamari.  The pan fried gnocchi was buttery smooth and I liked the slight crunch on the outside.  I wasn't a fan of the brown butter spiced sauce that it came with, but I think that was a personal taste thing (read: I may not like cumin.. still trying to figure that out haha).  The stuffed calamari was good, and I liked the spiciness of the sauce. \n\nWe had the strudel for a pasta dish.  This was good (what baked pasta isn't??) but simple.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the meal were the entrees.  We got the rabbit and the filet mignon.  The rabbit was presented whole* (kinda creepy but also kinda cool haha).  This was by far the least appetizing because it was so incredibly dry and hard to eat with all the tiny bones left inside.  The cabbage jam type thing on top was sweet and delicious, but I really wished the rabbit weren't so dry.  The filet was ok, but it was stringy and could've been juicier.\n\nWe ended with the bonet (dark chocolate/amaretto flan) and the tiramisu.  The bonet was the best dish of the night -- really rich and good.  The tiramisu was ok, but probably closer to the bottom of my ranking of tiramisus I've had in my life.\n\nAs for everything else, the place was cozy/small -- definitely more for intimate occasions, and the service though nice was somewhat slow.\n\nEverything (except that one dessert) was lacking, so based on the food, I wouldn't be back.

He seemed genuinely interested in us and how we enjoyed the meal. \n\nOur server did an excellent job. He was attentive, knowledgeable, and very pleasant and friendly.\n\nWe had the scallops, gnocchi, and ravioli for to start. I had the veal shank and my cousin had the salmon special. Both entrees were exquisite. The veal shank melted in my mouth and was beautiful to look at. Served with warm risotto the dish was a large portion and as good as a piece of meat gets. \n\nThe scallops were very tender and delicious. The ravioli was definitely the best I've had- divine! \n\nFor dessert I had the tiramisu and it was amazing. So good. I could go on and on about how good Albona was. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir from Italy. The bottle was about $42 and was very tasty. Our server recommended it to us and was proud to serve us the wine. He even gave us each a free glass of the same wine once our bottle was gone! \n\nThe owner actually thanked us for buying the Bloomspot deal which I have never experienced before.

Came into the restaurant to check with the staff, it took about 5 minutes to get anyone's attention (a minor infraction) and this was with only one table in use.  But they said no issue stay parked.  Which was nice as i was ready to hunt down some parking while my family sat.\n\nWe were seated, TABLE #2, and it really took a while for the staff to get things together.  Ordering wine took a while and we had to ask twice for one of the beers, (okay again a minor infraction).  Wine list needs some work and could do with more wines within the $50-$100 range rather than at $50/$100.\n\nChef came out chatted about the specials and what he could create.  That was nice.\n\nWe ordered appetizers and the chef also sent out a complimentary salad.  Yet another nice jester.\n\n3 of 4 entrees came.  Now the snags get a tad above minor.  My entrees came - wrong order - lamb chops and not the veal shank.  We were questioned were we sure, we said we told our waitress twice and the wrong order had mustard which i don't eat.  No acknowledgment or apology, but i will say that's a minor infraction.  We saw her go back to her station look at the order she had written down and realise she had messed up.  As the others ate i waited, about 10 minutes, before another waiter came by to say my meal was on its way.  Yet another 10 minutes passed and my family were essentially done.  I had to go to the kitchen to find our waiter and ask he cancel my order and just bring the bill.  10 more minutes passed before this new waiter said he was bringing out the meal and it would be free.

We've been waiting 26 years to serve you.\" - Sam\n\nClearly, I have waited too damn long to eat here. Albona is one the best restaurants I have ever dined in. According to Yelp categories, this is an Italian restaurant. False. Albona is an Istrian restaurant, which technically makes it a Croatian restaurant. \u017divjeli!\n\nUnfortunately, Yelp doesn't have a \"Croatian\" category on their website. Luckily, their programming team has managed to add a \"Hipster\" category. It's good to know Yelp HQ has its priorities straight. I could care less about the country of Croatia, which has some of the finest beaches, women, and food in the world. As long as I can be categorized on Yelp, my inner hipster can rest easy at night.\n\nThe Djevojka took me here as part an \"All Things Croatian\" themed gift, which was pretty much a day jam filled with a Croatian breakfast, wine, beer, lunch, snacks, soccer jerseys, dinner, and of course, her. Yes, I'm spoiled.\n\nIn advance, she had made a reservation with Sam who happened to be our host for the evening. Sam is an amazing host. He leads us into the intimate dining room, seated us, greeted us, made food recommendations, organized the food delivery, introduced each dish, refilled our wine glasses, and pretty much did everything in his power to ensure our dinner experience was perfect. Well, he succeeded.\n\nLuckily, for Sam, the food just happens to amazing at Albona. The appetizers were delicious. The dungeness crab appetizer made my eyes roll to the back of my head. And the pan fried gnocchi appetizer was so good, I nearly made a mess in my pants.\n\nI settled down, took a deep breath, and managed to compose myself for the amazing entrees. The Djevojka ordered the stuffed pork loin. It was an explosion of flavors. I ordered the rabbit. Who needs listen to Sting and learn about tantric sex, when each bite of this dish is like a mini orgasm?\n\nFor dessert, the dark chocolate-Amaretto flan and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e were really good. So good, I was licking each dessert dish. The Djevojka shot me a look, but I think she was secretly pleased by uncouth, caveman-like actions. There's only one other time a gentleman such as myself acts like a caveman, and this is not the forum to discuss that. *Clears Throat*\n\nIn the end, Albona was an outstanding 4-star dining experience. But the extra star is for Sam, our \"star\" of the evening who went above and beyond to make our visit to Albona a memorable one. As it turns out, Sam is not just the host. He is also the owner and executive chef. His wife is the pastry chef. It truly is a small operation serving up big flavors. It just adds the intimate dining experience at Albona.\n\nI waited 26 years to eat at Albona. I waited too damn long.

Pasta had to be wrapped to go. The dessert was too much, but I couldn't have left without trying it. It was 100% worth it!\nIt's actually a hard-to-find place. i would never knew about this restaurant if not the Bloomspot. When we walked in, it was really busy, only 1 table empty - ours.

I went here for dinner using a Groupon deal, and the man who seated us and took our order was quite lovely about it. He offered us two appetizers instead of one to share or getting two soups & two salads (which is what the deal stated), so we got the mussels & potato gnocchi.

Also, the gnocchi comes in a sirloin sauce, which was also very delicious. \n\nWe then ordered the rack of lamb entree along with their special of the night which was  mortadella & Parmesan raviolis. Each dish was very flavorful and amazing, however we were SO full after the two huge appetizers that it was a little painful trying to eat everything in our main course. The food was all so good though that I forced myself to finish! \n\nOur Groupon deal also gave us a dessert to share, but the owner said we could each choose one dessert for ourselves. We were to the point of popping though, so we just got some coffee instead. He even offered to let us take desserts to go, which was so so sweet, but even thinking about food and/or dessert was too much to handle at that point. He was so sweet, funny and nice though, I was very happy that we had this lovely experience. \n\nOverall, amazing delicious experience in a laidback and intimate setting.

Both are moving to Miami next month, and this was a chance to talk about this exciting new chapter in their lives and to catch up since our last dinner together. I'm also hoping that after his move, Ben starts writing Yelp reviews again, regains his Elite Badge, and otherwise enhances the Magic City by his hard work and wicked smart personality. To get him started, Gayle and I presented him and Wifey a copy of Scarface (which includes a digital \"F Bomb\" counter).\n\nSince we're from the Midwest, all 4 of us arrived early for our 7:30 PM dinner date. Some good neighbourhood parking Karma and a keen eye for locating Albona's understated exterior also helped. Gayle and I also learned quickly that Ben is a \"regular\" here, or as he joked, it's one of the few situations where his association with a restaurant is a good thing. The practical upshot was that we were well taken care during the evening, starting with a glass of Prosecco when we first sat down. That high level of service continued through 2 appetizers, a couple bottles of excellent red wine, the main courses, dessert, and being greeted and thanked by the Chef at the end.  You would think that Ben and Amy were VIPs here, but I did make sure that we split the check even with all that charm, class, and wit that was flying around.\n\nThe dining room was well appointed, intimate, and was very conducive to the engaging and enjoyable 3 hour dinner conversation that ensued. Our lives intersect in various places (like St. Louis Park, MN) and it was fun to talk from various common frames of reference. The food was also fabulous, and when you combine that with the ambiance, the service, and the company, times like this make me wish I could throw in a 6th Star for Gestalt.", "author": "Eric B."}

I liked the mushroom soup a lot, even though I don't like mushrooms. The pear is drizzled in sweet sauce and paired with a sharp blue cheese, and I enjoyed that immensely.

I normally would have said something, but the owner was so delightful, I decided to let it pass (but it was a bit annoying). \n\nOther than the tip thing, my only complaint, and this is very minor (but it is the reason for the 4, not 5 star review) was the service.  The waiters all had a wonderful attitude/demeanor, but the actual \"service\" portion of the evening could be stepped up a notch i.e. training.  For example, the server mixed up our orders on both the appetizer and the main course (between just my husband and I).  When we were finished with our dinner, it took a long time for someone to come and ask us about dessert and each time a waiter walked by the table (including the time when they actually served our dessert), they just left our empty wine glass and a juice can, which we had neatly placed on the front of the table for pick up.  I feel bad even mentioning this, but there really is no excuse for not providing top notch service in such a small restaurant which was well staffed for the size of the restaurant (we were there on a Thurs).  \n\nThe service issue aside, this is currently my \"go-to\" Italian restaurant and I can't wait to try more of their food!", "author": "Jerolyn D."}

A bit too crunchy for my taste (but it was my friend's dish, so it wasn't my place to comment on it to the wait staff.)\n\nStrudel con pasta fatta in casa - fresh pasta roll filled with slices of prosciutto & Lappi cheese; baked in a casserole with toasted bread crumbs, b\u00e9chamel, & tomato-cream sauce - My wife ordered this, and I was able to get a small bite before she scarfed the rest of it down. This had some nice flavors and was very rich. It might be a bit too rich for me to have eaten it myself, but the bite was very enjoyable.\n\nRack of Lamb - This was pretty amazing.

The prosciutto arugula salad,  catch of the day, and Sam's marina sauce are must haves.  Highly recommend this restaurant to all my friends and anyone reading this review.  Would give it 10 stars if available.  Consider this a hidden gem in our neighborhood.", "author": "Mila P."}

The restaurant is in an easy location, close to the wharf and north beach, and the environment is relaxed and welcoming. Our waiter was friendly and very helpful in guiding us to the best menu choices. We started with the tomato soup -- delicious -- and warm fig salad, which was one of the best dishes of the night. I'll be going back just for the fig salad. Next, we had the lamb and stroganoff. The portions were perfect and the entrees were all very reasonably priced. We didn't leave anything on the plate. Dessert's also a must at this place. The chef's wife is a pastry chef and we had an awesome piece of chocolate cake. We'll definitely be going back again soon.

I looked on the website and the website didn't mention anything).\n\nSo we walk in, find out there is $95 pp four-course Valentine's Day Menu tonight.

I heartily recommend sharing your dishes with if that's at all palatable to you.\n\nAlbona takes pride in making Istrian food, which derives from Italy, Croatia, and Slovenia, and leads to robust variants of dishes we know elsewhere.

No rest for the weary; this was a tough table to get despite the call of Black Rock City and other sunny vacation spots.

We began laughing a bit as the meal progressed as the fullness of our growing stomachs tried to fight back against enjoying more of each superb combination of flavors. The braised veal, strudel pasta, and risotto with mushrooms still come to mind. Oh, and the penne a la arrabbiata was both spicy and fresh. \n\nBuses and taxis (and someday, the T line) are close by on Columbus Ave. Parking in this area of North Beach isn't easy, but not as tough as Grant Ave., for instance.

So one had the lamb stew; two of us the braised rabbit; and one had the veal shank. \n\nThe chef comes out to check on everything, and said if you don't like what you ordered, let him know, and he'll replace. Our friend didn't like his rabbit, so ordered the Adriatic fish stew instead. \n\nI had the rabbit too, and the chef asked me did I want something else. Rabbit has a tendency to be dry anyway, so I declined and just ate what I could. \n\nOn the tab, the chef made a point of not charging for one rabbit entree because he said he wanted us to come back in the future.

So he brought out a plate for me and my brother to try and it was awesome. The rabbit had a rich taste due to their ridiculously good sauce and the meat was very soft. I definitely recommend this dish if you feel like being adventurous. On top of this dish, the owner also gave us both a glass of sparkling Champaign! \n\nThe service was beyond my expectation, it was better than Gary Dankos and that is saying a lot since I love that place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-05", "description": "The first thing you'll notice when you walk into Albona is its \"unpretentious\" interior, which was undoubtedly romantic, cozy, and family-like. You'll be welcomed by the owner and former executive chef, Sam -- the one who \"treats you like family\" and \"welcomes you to his kitchen\" graciously as soon as you walk through the door. Before I delve into the specifics, I'll say that prior to using the Groupon deal we got, I heavily read reviews here on Yelp. As a 4.5 star rating with 450+ reviews, in addition to all the raving reviews about top-notch service and exquisite Istrian cuisine, I think I overall walked into Albona with pretty high expectations. \n\nWith that, as soon as we walked in, Sam welcomed us, immediately thanked us for reserving the night, and sat us at our table. While our Groupon was only good for two entrees, one appetizer, two champagnes, and a dessert, Sam graciously gave me (under 18) a complimentary apple cider and told us we could choose two appetizers, all with a smile on his face. Immediately I felt like we were being treated like kings. They gave us our menu, brought out absolutely delicious home-made rolls that were freshly baked, and gave us their recommendations -- \"no pasta,\" as Sam put it, \"today you try something new.\" Sounded good. \n\nWe ordered the panfried Gnocchi that everybody raved about on here (\"Grandma's specialty), in a sirloin sauce \"laced with cumin,\" and the calamari stuffed with white fish and marinara. The Gnocchi was delightful; it's not really a potato dumpling, but rather, a deep fried mashed potato ball with really a European take on curry sauce. It's almost the same thing as the fried potato balls you'd find at Gregoire... with curry. These were really good; order it because it's something different. The calamari was pretty good. I personally dislike the flavor of squid, but the marinara -- nice and acidic as it should be -- was absolutely delightful. I didn't care much for the filling inside, but the marinara made up for all of it. \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the chicken with white wine and capers with mashed potatoes and broccoli. For starters, on the menu it says that the chicken is \"pan fried,\" so I was surprised to see that when I got mine it was two large chicken breast cutlets with the white wine sauce on it. I was under the impression that the chicken would be cooked in the sauce, but hey, coming from a kid whose favorite food is tonkatsu, I was fine with a cutlet (although I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was a cutlet). To be honest, it was nothing to write home about. The chicken was done perfectly, it was crispy, the mashed potatoes were delightful, and the sauce -- while not in that much quantity -- was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, and not sure if it was worth the $25. The portion was massive. if you come to Albona, come with an empty stomach -- the portions here for the entrees are large and definitely \"perfect for sharing,\" as Sam explained. My mom ordered the veal, which could have had a little more salt (but as a Chinese American I typically like things on the saltier side), but was absolutely divine. My dad ordered the Adriatic Stew, which was good, but nothing that amazing. For dessert we got the strudel, which had an awesome apple filling, but the crust lacked the puffy puff-pastryness that you would expect a strudel to have. Don't pay the extra $3 for the ice cream too; it's really not worth it but it is a nice touch if it's included in a deal you have. In all honesty, the best way to explain the food -- at least from our experience -- at Albona is good. It's not amazing, it's not phenomenal, it's most certainly not bad, but it's good. Just good, and at times if you order the right thing, it's really good. But once again, just not amazing. \n\nThroughout the entire Saturday night I was there, the service -- as explained earlier -- was phenomenal in the beginning. But as the restaurant began to become more and more crowded, the signature service at Albona -- while still 100% better than average -- kind of disappeared into the night, and I most certainly never felt the \"family\" or \"long time friend\" feel that many on here raved about. All the waiters and waitresses -- along with Sam of course -- were kind, caring, and good at what they did, but I felt like we weren't treated as well as the reviews here talk about (even though, once again, the service is better than average.) \n\nThe jist: Don't walk in with too high expectations, come in with an empty stomach, don't be afraid to try something new, and most importantly, be ready for a night filled with a crap load of good food that fits harmoniously and angelically with good friends and family. That's really the best way to sum up Albona. Check it out. \n\nWhile this is at heart a 3.5, I'm just giving it a four because it's a modest family-run business, and the people there just give it the extra push.\n\nFood: 24 | Decor: 20 | Service: 24", "author": "Bryce F."}

My husband had the \"Arosto de coniglio,\" a braised rabbit dish.  It tasted like braised chicken, which is fine if it was a great braised chicken, but it was not worth $30 we paid for it.  The biggest disappoint was their dessert.  We had the \"Crema de gelato,\" which is supposed to be a gelato mousse.  I like gelato; I like mousse; I have to like this one!

We found plentiful street parking a block or two away.\n\nThey strangely called us and asked us to come a little earlier for our 8:15 reservation made on Urban Spoon, which can be an imposition for those of us coming up from the South Bay.  Nonetheless, traffic was light that Monday and we made it up about 45 minutes early ... it turned out that they were seating plenty of walk-in traffic around 8:15.\n\nBeing small ( they had two servers working that night ) the pacing was sometimes slow.  Service, however, was effusively friendly and personal.\n\nThey offer beer and wine by the glass or bottle.  A few Croatian wines on the list were offered by the bottle only the night we were there.\n\nThe menu is from Istria - a little section of Europe stuck between Slovenia, Italy and Croatia.  Tastes are heavily savory, with strong sweet and sour components.  Though a little saucy and heavy for our tastes, the food is well-prepared and complexly flavored.  The Chifeleti are extremely light balls of fried potato pasta, and probably one of the most interesting things on the menu.  The stuffed calamari appetizer was also very good in an excellent red sauce.   The pasta strudel dish, advertised as one of their specialties, was decent, but somewhat heavy, with familiar flavors.\n\nWe had a nicely done rack of lamb and an interesting half rabbit - both large entrees.  For dessert, the Bonet had strong carmelized flavors, and the Crema de Gelato was nice and light, almost like a semifreddo.\n\nOverall, the service, though slow at times, was some of the most effusively welcoming we've seen in the city.

Of the two, I think the flan (the one I picked) is the better option.\n\nWhat was a delight was that chef Sam recognized us from our multiple visits before and as usual was he extremely genial and funny self. We'll definitely be back again very soon.\n\nParking protip: even though there is free valet, we always find ample free parking on Bay street which is just one block over.", "author": "Mercutio k."}

I wished there were more options for vegetarians to choose from.  Their soup that night was not veggie friendly.  Also their salads were very limited if you didn't want any meats on them.  For for the main course I believe there were 2 items for me to choose from.  I shared a cheese ravioli with another girl.  It was overall pretty good.  I think my favorite part was the bread and butter.  Yum!  Also how sad at the same time.  LOL.  \n\nBut if you are a meat eatter, this place is pretty good.  My friend was very happy with his meal.

But let's be honest:  Chez Panisse has an epic reputation and the diner goes in with fantastic expectations;  Albona is about as unknown as its facade is unremarkable, and if I had any expectations at all, this close to the tomato-based spaghetti joints of North Beach, they weren't all that great.\n\nYet let's also note what other Yelpers have:  This place is as expensive as Chez Panisse and any other culinary temple of San Francisco, so those who have noted the expense aren't out of place;  entrees are in the mid to high twenties.\n\nThe food was very, very good.  It was closer in character to the tomato rich spaghetti dives nearby, than to Cotogna over in Jackson Square, which is a bit more modern in its take on Tuscany, and we left thinking as we did on leaving Cotogna, what a good meal we had.  I'm not having such moments as often as I'd like, given the expense of dining out.\n\nI'd ordered the braised sauerkraut with onions;  and the sardines with glazed onions, red wine vinegar, golden raisins and pine nuts (served chiled); and for an entree---being utterly uninspired by anything else (which at the moment all looks delicious) the \"Strudel con pasta fatta in casa\"  ($42. already, and that was just me, without the opening cocktail, and wine).    \n\nThe strudel is described as pasta rolls filled with prosciutto and lappi cheese, baked with a crumb crust, bechamel and tomato sauce.  I ordered it more out of curiosity but it was really quite the item.  Mild, rich without overdoing it;   Others had the fish stew, venison, and veal, which was labeled \"Stinco de videl a la Triestina\"   Strudel and stinco.  How can you go wrong?\n\nWe'd stumbled across this place while walking back from the Wharf a few months back and had wanted to go back.  The old post-1906 facade gives no hints, and only has a tiny window.  Inside it's a bit dark, and somewhat fussily comfortable, like a relative's house---gramps came over on the boat.  We were clearly the youngest people there---even with me and the partner having twenty years over our friends.  It was not painfully quiet---which I would hate.  People talked but didn't have to yell to be heard, so the ambience was nice.\n\nTo me the place seems a bit old fashioned in appearance and food, without being stale or held back by some dogma of the owner.   It's a lot better than most of the other places in North Beach, and different than Cotogna, different but good.\n\nI'd think this would be a great date place (unless your date has a thing for older people, you shouldn't have to worry about distractions) or for anniversaries.  But don't let the idea of special occasions hold you back. I'd go eat here anytime.\n\nAnd oh yes, the service was spot on, very friendly without trying to join your party.  Parking is an issue, but why are you driving in North Beach, anyway?  There are garages nearby, don't be so cheap, use one.", "author": "Paul T."}

I would say this is the kind of Italian food I would expect to get in a small town that does not have a vibrant restaurant scene, and that does not know mediocre from great Italian food, so anything goes. And at these prices, it's insane. The fig salad with brie was just OK.  My pasta was fine, but not great: slightly overcooked, without anything to distinguish it. I was at a large table, and only one person, who ordered the salmon, seemed to genuinely enjoy his food. $42/person, without alcohol, for something slightly beneath Italian comfort food.", "author": "Morris R."}

There is heavy influence from Italy which is why I assume it is listed here as Italian.  But even the Italian-style dishes have there own unique twist to them.  There also seems to be heavy influences from Austria/Germany (pork with sauerkraut, lamb stew and rabbit) as well as the Eastern Mediterranean (spices).\n\nI made the reservation a couple of weeks prior to our arrival and the person on the phone was very helpful.  He was very honest with me and told me that it would be difficult for them to seat us at peak time because of the small size of the restaurant.  I had a group of ten people.  We originally made a reservation for 8:00 P.M.  I later called and changed it to 5:00 P.M. which actually worked out better for them.\n\nWe arrived about 5 minutes early and were warmly greeted as they were finishing preparing the dining room for the evening.  We were asked to wait a few minutes while they completed setup.  This was only a couple of minutes.  I let them know that we had brought some special wines along to celebrate the evening.  Once they overheard that it was my 50th birthday the waiter told me that he was going to waive the corkage charge for us that evening.  I told him that wasn't necessary but he insisted.  At the end of the meal I offered our waiter some of the wine and he toasted with us.\n\nI had reviewed the menu online and had already decided what I was going to have.  I started with the grilled sardine appetizer which was served with sweet onions, pine nuts and golden raisins (almost like a marmalade).  These were delicious and just set the stage for a remarkably great meal.  My entree selection was the pork tenderloin stuffed with sauerkraut and prosciutto with a side of baked apples and plums and some sauteed red cabbage.  I finished with the apple strudel with cinnamon, pine nuts and golden raisins with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream.  They also brought me a panna cotta dessert for my birthday which I shared with the table.\n\nThis was one of the best meals that I have ever eaten.  Everyone in the party was very satisfied with their meals.  The service was impeccable.  The entire staff was very friendly and personable.  You could tell that they loved what they were doing and that their hearts were in the preparation of the food.  I don't think that I can possibly recommend this place high enough.  When in San Francisco I will definitely be back.", "author": "Karl M."}

The salad we shared was nothing more than lettuce with a few strips of prosciutto on it. Nothing special. My raviolis came with two types of sauces. One was butter and was very greasy the other was a dark meat sauce with meat chunks in it which overpowered the pasta. When I called to make reservations the person who answered was very friendly but when we arrived the guy at the door had a sour look on his face and was anything but friendly. When we asked to move because of the draft he seemed annoyed. The leather bench I sat on was torn. There were only 2 parties of 2, ourselves and then a a party of 4 came in. The place was not full so why the annoyance?  Our waiter was nice. The atmosphere was cozy but very dated. We had the pana cotta which was fine, my husband's  wine was fine. He liked his filet but the sides were nothing special. I think for the price they could update a few things. Your first impression of a place is how you are greeted when you walk in and so this left us both cold from the start. Too bad because we were so looking forward to loving this place.", "author": "Doreen B."}

Sam, the owner, greeted us and asked us if our visit was a special occasion. We informed him of our reception shopping and he excitedly said he would bring us a little of everything that night so we could begin our menu prep. It was the first time we had been there and we felt welcome and cared for. Not to mention the food was amazing! The whole night all we could say was yum. We left feeling confident we had found the right place for our reception. We settled on a price, created our menu including a wine selection and went on our way.\nOn the day of the reception Sam did not disappoint! He decorated the tables with flowers, printed out our menu for our 4 course luncheon and his staff was attentive and friendly. Throughout the lunch I looked around the room with each course and all of our guests kept commenting on how good the food was. We chose the arugula salad with apples and prosciutto, the gnocci (is to die for!), the pasta strudel and then for the 4th course our guests chose from either the salmon, veal or chicken with the brandied cherry sauce. I can't wait to take my hubby back. Just writing this review is making me hungry.\nOne note for you wedding planners, this is not a big venue! We had 25 people and the place could probably only seat a little more than that comfortably. But ask Sam anyway, he is more than helpful.", "author": "Rana B."}

I was going to give it a 4...but youll see why.\n\nfirst off, make a reservation. I dont know why you need to on a thursday night, but just make one. =) many people started coming in around 7pm.\n\nthis is a really small place. the ambiance and decor is really nice. its perfect for nice family gatherings (quiet) or for dates. =)\nservice was awesome and very attentive.\n\nok its food time!\nso i got a Strudel con pasta fatta in casa. this is a baked dish and comes with pasta rolls filled with thin slice of prosciutto & lappi cheese covered in bechamel & tomato-cream sauce. it said it has bread crumbs on it..but i didnt taste it. hahaha. the dish looked small, but it was quite filling. i got sick of it after the first half because i normally dont like or eat ham..and all the cheese was a bit overwhelming for me. the sauces and pasta itself were delicious! I felt like i could have make this dish..it wasnt anything special to me. My taste buds are a bit different, but I think the general public would love this dish.\n\nhalibut special: the halibut was tasty and cooked just right. it was absolutely amazing . i wish i got that instead of the baked dish. (and halibut is my favorite fish) I can still taste it in my mouth..deeelliicccious! it also comes with steamed veggies. \nWarning: if youre a big eater, i suggest you get something else..this was not enough for my friend.\n\nmushroom risotto was yummy, but i also got sick of it very quickly. my bf and i ended up finishing each other dishes in the end. I am a big fan of mushrooms and it was juicy and tasty! i could have eaten 1 lb of them or more. hahaha. the rice seemed not fully cooked to me..but im so use to asian rice.. it was kind of hard, but i had to chew it to get the full flavor of it.\n\nI dont quite agree with what everyone says. i have had better italian food before, I just wasnt satisfied with Albona. although, i did enjoy their fresh baked breads and their fresh butter!!!! i could have ate those and the mushrooms all night long. hahaha\n\none more thing to point out....as I was getting change, I was standing near the kitchen. and someone had ordered the biscotti and I saw the waiter take out a pretty, gold box and popped 3 biscottis on a dinky, beautiful plate and served it with elegance. I HATE RESTAURANTS WHO DO THAT. I know the biscottis were probably glorious, but the menu does say HOMEMADE DESSERTS.. not good to cheat your customers.\n\nWarning: if youre a big eater, this place WILL NOT fill you up. \n\n- a full strudel was 17 \n-a full mushroom risotto was 17\n- halibut special is probably around 20 something.\n( i paid 22 total including tip and tax)\n\ni believe our bill was around 86 dollars.", "author": "Jen T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "Late is better than never right? I'm so embarrassed, because this was from NYE dinner 2 years ago... Hah!\n\nAnyways, the place was a little difficult to find, mostly because we didn't know what to expect. Outwardly, it didn't look like much. There were small windows, and closed doors, and it honestly looked like it was closed. It didn't really look like any of the restaurants we had ever been to.\n\nThe interior was also equally very small, and although at the time I was uncomfortable and I thought \"oh, this restaurant must not be doing well\" at the beginning of my meal, by the time I left, I was extremely glad that I had reserved the spot. The restaurant has *very* limited seating. I don't think it can seat 100 people, even. Maybe 40 people. By the time we left, the restaurant was almost at maximum capacity, and bustling.\n\nWe were greeted by the owner and another waiter, who took my coat to the coatroom, a first for me. We got seated in a very cozy corner (later, we found out that the people who were supposed to sit after us was supposed to be his MOTHER). The menu for the night was a 6 course prix fixe affair, so it took a lot of the guess work out of ordering. However, our waiter, being the owner, was super knowledgeable about EVERYTHING in the menu, and even told us that he's been eating the food since he was very small, so it really reinforced our faith in the food.\n\nWe started off with some Prosecco. When we went to draw out our IDs, expecting him to check, he said that he would humor us in looking at them, because, as we saw later throughout the night, the clientele is mostly older people. The Processo: delicious. We went to our amuse bouche: three fried gorgonzola balls. And, as soon as we got them, the owner RAN over to us, and said \"EAT IN ONE BITE!\" and explained to us that because the middle is liquified, if you bit into it, the innards would gush out and spill over our black shirts. I think he ran over because boyfriend was going to stick his fork in it. It was pretty good, and went well with the Prosecco, as he had said. \n\nOur next course was a celeriac soup for him, and a salad for me. I guess I wasn't in the mood to really eat a salad; I ordered because I thought I needed to eat some vegetables. The soup was very good, though, and I thoroughly enjoyed the apples in my salad. I also found out that I'm not terribly fond of white truffle viniagrette. \n\nThe third course was a little disappointing, and Alex said that our waiter looked a little sad that I didn't finish mine. I would like to say: I don't like all seafood. I don't eat much seafood. When I eat sushi, I usually eat shrimp, eel, octopus, and salmon. That's it. With that said, I got a chilled crab cake, and he got scallops in a rose sauce. His was delicious, but I found out that night that I don't like scallops after all. I was... not impressed with my crab cake. It was too salty, and I had no idea what the clear gelatin surrounding it was. So, I was a little grossed out, and gave it to Alex to eat, who couldn't bring himself to finish it either. \n\nAt this time, we were getting full really fast. We notified Michael (the owner waiting on us), and he said that he would space us out slower. \n\nAnyways, we went on to our palette cleanser, which was a mandarine sorbet. So delicious! The owner said that when he was little, he thought it was awesome that restaurants gave two desserts: one before your entree, and one after. I wish I had more.\n\nBy that time, we had finished our Prosecco, and got some California white wine, which was so delicious.\n\nWe both got filet mignons. Cooked very well. I don't even know what to say about it. The peppercorns didn't bother me. They were very mild and soft! My mouth is juicing up at the memory of the meat, though. That was the second time I had filet mignon, and so far, it's the best I ever had. It was cooked (by default) to medium rare, and the owner had told us that the furthest they want to go is medium, because that would've ruined the cut of meat.\n\nOur last dishes: coffee and dessert. We got a nougat-vanilla ice cream, and a chocolate cream torte. They were both very, very good. The coffee was something that I really needed by that point, because I took some Sudafed at the beginning of the meal to help with my cough and headache. I don't even know what was my favorite, but they both complimented each other and the coffee very nicely. \n\nThus, dinner ended. We got the bill, which came out to be $235 after tip. Overall, the meal was excellent, and the service was wonderful. I want to come back and eat here again, maybe on Valentine's Day. \n\nI do recommend this place. It's on Francisco street between Taylor and Mason (I believe), and open from 5 to 11 PM. Free parking, too! Make sure you make a reservation! It's an overall fun restaurant to dine at, and a very friendly atmosphere.", "author": "Hayne P."}

This restaurant is Istrian, its cuisine is definitely influenced by the location of Albona, overlooking the Istrian peninsula bordered by Italy, Slovenia and Croatia.  But to be clear, the food was delicious, well prepared and our wait staff was attentive.\n\nAlbona is located in a neighborhood (and if you google the address, it will take you to the back door, not the front so be prepared for that).  It's a small place, or do we say intimate? But not uncomfortably so.  We started with the Chifeleti de la nona con sugo de carne al cumin ($9.00); which is Grandmother's Speciality, pan fried potato gnocchi in a brown sirloin sauce lace with cumin, delicious and something I've never had before.  We followed with Calamai al forno con salsa marinara ($12.00) a bit expensive for 6 pieces of Squid, stuffed with fish, toasted bread crumbs, parsley & garlic; roasted in marinara sauce, but cooked perfectly.  The squid was so tender.  For our second we had Strudel con pasta fatta in casa ($19.00) easily split between us; Fresh pasta rolls filled with slices of baked prosciutto & Lappi cheese; baked in a casserole with toasted breadcrumbs; b\u00e9chamel & tomato cream sauce...delish!  (and filling)...so it's a good thing we also split the final Involtin de porco con capuzi garbi e prosuto ($27.00) a beautiful dish of Pork Loin stuffed with braised sauerkraut, prosciutto, apple and plums - see not your typical Italian.  But then I like atypical food.  \n\nThe wine list is good with plenty of by the glass choices.  We brought in a bottle and bought two whites by the glass and they waived our corkage - always a nice courtesy.  Of course, we did taste our waiter some of our wine, so that always helps too.  \n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience.

After a long research on the internet I came across this place. Here is my review:\n\nI love the comfortable ambiance, the staff is very polite and the chef sometimes comes out of the kitchen to make sure everything is fine. I love that they have a few wines from the north east of Italy like the italian Pinot Noir (or Pinot Nero) which is much lighter than the Californian version. Perfect pair with chicken or even seafood. Try the scallops appetizer and don't miss the Panna Cotta for dessert, so far the best I've ever had!! Yummy! \n\nIf I lived in SF I'd be a regular!!", "author": "Val J."}

The chef graciously guided the four of us through the menu, and made sure we had the most delicious options at every turn.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the scallops (perfectly done and in an amazing sauce), the gnocchi (savory and delicious), the stuffed squid (good, but out-shined by the other dishes), and the sardines (which tasted very much like herring, but much less pungent).  The scallops and gnocchi were both very impressive. We paired this with a Croatian white wine the waiter was nice enough to open and let us taste before deciding to order. At this point, we were already so impressed by the service and the food we could have all walked away satisfied.\n\nBut when the main courses arrived, Albona elevated itself to something truly unique and unforgettable.  I had the rabbit, which was one of the most juicy and flavorful rabbit preparations I've ever had.  Everyone around the table had a taste, and everyone was blown away.  We also ordered the chicken - succulent, and juicy, and served with the most amazing cherries (left in cognac for 3 months!).  The pork with sauerkraut  was impressive, but the best dish by far was the lamb.  Lamb rib, loin, and sausage, each prepared with such care, the whole table was overwhelmed.  The loin in particular was as good as any steak I've ever had.\n\nAfter so much deliciousness, there was no way we wouldn't try the desserts.  We ordered two, but the chef insisted on bringing us four - and with good reason.  We ordered the tiramisu and the apple pie, which were both very good, but the dark-chocolate flan with cherries, and panna cotta he brought us were both absolutely out-of-this-world!  I'd recommend you stay light on the appetizers, and make sure to leave room for these two desserts.\n\nI simply cannot praise this restaurant enough.  Go.  Go now.  Bon appetit!", "author": "Josh L."}

The benefits of patronizing a family-run business came through from the moment we arrived. After giving our car to the free valet, the owner's nephew welcomed us in, joking warmly as we waited for our other guests to arrive.\n\nBruno the owner was there, making a point of stopping at each table and chatting freely with all his patrons, old school. The entire staff had a great attitude, from the servers to the bussers. \n\nSo they win on personality, but food? A hit there too. I started with the stuffed calamari which I definitely recommend. The sauce was so delicious my plate had nothing left when they took it away. For my main course I chose the lamb, again awesome. Given how wonderful my appetizer and entree were I had to spring for dessert and indeed the apple strudel was well worth the calories.\n\nAtmosphere-wise it's obviously not a trendy spot, but the perfect place for a dinner when the parents are in town.

We finally decided that this would be the perfect date night cure to a busy work week and catch up after busy travel schedules had kept us apart.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a reservation for 7pm on a Thursday. Upon arrival, we were sat promptly and given menus. No server announced themselves or came to tell us about the specials. Eventually, someone noticed our menu stack and came to take our order and bring our wine. \n\nThe first course was pan fried gnocchi in a sirloin sauce. To me, the potato tasted burnt. The sauce was very salty. Someone arrived with some bread. There was a really obnoxiously loud table of 8 behind us which made it hard to hear each other.\n\nBefore we'd made it to course #2, the waiter who had taken our order slammed headlong into the corner of our table next to my boyfriend, completely up-ending the flat top on a diagonal. The bottle of wine fell, spilled towards me, and began dumping onto me and the booth side I was sitting in. The table cloth was soaked in red wine and I was trying to save my new dress. The kind gentleman next to us was our savior here - he caught the wine bottle, helped us upright the table, and suggested we slide over to his table, as he and his wife were leaving for the theatre.\n\nThe server was less than helpful and certainly far from apologetic! I was dabbing my dress with water to try and get the red wine out - now at the theatre couple's table, still sitting in front of their old bread, water, and crumbs...and a second server brings course #2 and just plops it down in the middle of the mess! No cutlery, no water,no napkins, half our wine is in the booth next to me or on the floor. No apologies.\n\nNo offer to replace the wine. We did get new bread, napkins and water. We never got new bread plates. We're not the types to want white glove service and people dotting on us to catch out crumbs. We didn't make a fuss or make high demands and we were still hoping the food would be the thing to make the evening.\n\nCourse #2 was the pasta strudel, which had a nice combination of tomato, bechamel cream sauce, pasta, ham, but was a bit soupy - difficult to enjoy at this point.\n\nCourse #3 took a while to come. We ordered the $29 seafood stew special and it was completely disappointing. It came with mostly rings of calamari, 4 overcooked mussels, half a scallop (a total sliver that was not even shareable), a couple chunks of what they claimed was seabass but tasted like overcooked halibut. The sauce was really rich in a way that did not pair well with the seafood and it was so over-seasoned it tasted like someone had dumped a bouillon cube and a bunch of salt in some half-and-half and poured it over the seafood.\n\nAt the end, the waiter brought over an open bottle of wine and tried to offer to top us up...as if this would right the evening. No thanks.\n\nWe got tiramisu to go - because we just wanted to go home at this point, but we still had hopes that something would be good at a restaurant like Albona that has a surprising history of good reviews.\n\nI worked at a nice Italian place years ago and if something like this ever happened to a customer, we would have comped their whole meal. All-together, we still paid $80 for a partially comped stressful, unsatisfying meal with crass, cranky service. My boyfriend is such a sweetheart he still left a good tip on top of this. We ate a bite of the tiramisu when we got home. It was a small, dry sliver of cake: a sad, stale end to the evening.", "author": "Lindsay M."}

Altona was just down the street from out hotel and looked like the right kind of atmosphere.\n\nWe arrived and we're seated within minutes (on a Friday night, too) sin reservations.   The scent of fresh capers and deliciousness was just enough to get the nose interested,  but not overbearing.  I am relatively picky, and while the menu was different, it still offered several attractive options.  I settled, rather quickly, on the strudel con pasta.  My girlfriend immediately jumped at the salmon in garlic/caper/butter sauce.\n\nBoth meals were delicious!!! The salmon was cooked  quite well but the sauce was a bit overpowered with the caper flavor. The strudel con pasta was frickin' amazing.  The sauce was creamy but not thick and the pasta was tender; both in great combination with the prosciutto.\n\nThe waiter made good on his suggestion of a white wine to go with our meal.  The wine wist was small, but so is the establishment. The waiters were very pleasant but not overbearing and the manager was very kind.\n\nOne drawback was the noise.  One table, centered in the room, was a little on the boisterous side, which was not the fault of the restaurant, but hearing a lady who was probably about a .20% BAC started off as entertaining but quickly got annoying.\n\nAll in all,  a very pleasant experience at a nice little restaurant.  It's not my favorite ST restaurant but it's worthy of a visit for a (mostly) quiet, quaint dining experience.", "author": "Joe A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-11", "description": "My college friends and I took a trip up to San Francisco and me and another food freak in our group were tasked with finding a restaurant that would take a party of six on a Saturday with a day's notice.  After much scrambling on Yelp and Opentable, we booked the single available opening at Albona and hoped for the best.\n\nAll six of our party walked away from that meal fulfilled and happy.  I could not have asked for more from this restaurant in terms of warmth and authenticity and spectacular food.\n\nThe place is family-run and comfortably established, and the owner - a nephew or other close relative of the original owner - works the phone line, the host station, and the dining room with genuine affability and an obvious love of the restaurant.  I spoke with him on the phone about four times making various small changes to our reservation (parties of 5 - no 6 - no 5 - no 6 - are hard to manage) and by the time we met in person he treated me like a familiar, without a hint of annoyance.  Our waiter was similarly friendly and charming, as well as attentive and helpful.  The service was really wonderful.  Our waiter had clear favorites on the menu and led us in the right directions with our food.\n\nAnd sweet Saint Francis of Assisi, the food.  Albona is an Istrian restaurant, the only one I've been to or even heard of, and it's named for the original owner's hometown in Istria.  The cuisine is regional Italian, but with influences from Austrians, Hungarians, Greeks, you name it.  If I come across another Istrian restaurant, I'm going in, no questions asked.\n\nFirst off, the bread basket was great - the sourdough had a nice thick crust and the rolls were soft and ideal for sopping.  There was plenty of sopping when we'd cleared any hint of solid food off our two appetizer plates.  If you're going to listen to anything in this review, let it be this: \"chifeleti de mia nona con sugo de carne al cum\u00edn.\"  This was the original owner's grandmother's specialty - pan-fried potato gnocchi in a cumin-laced brown sirloin sauce.  It was insane.  The gnocchi was fried a just-crispy golden-brown on the outside and stayed impossibly fluffy and potatoey inside.  The sauce was deep and hearty with an aromatic trail of cumin.  Everyone wanted more, and everyone took bread to sauce to clean the plate.  We had a similar experience with the strudel con pasta fatta in casa, a fresh pasta roll stuffed with prosciutto and Lappi cheese, then baked in a casserole with toasted bread crumbs, b\u00e9chamel, and a tomato-cream sauce.  Does that sound decadent?  Because it was.  It was creamy and rich and over-the-top delicious.\n\nAfter those appetizers, you would think it all went downhill, but the entrees were excellent.  Being good friends and Asian and all, our group went semi-family style and everything was superb.  The winner among winners was the lombo de aniel ai feri - the grilled lamb noisette marinated in red wine, olive oil, vinegar, fresh herbs, and mint.  I've never had lamb so tender, and the generous forward application of fresh herbs was among the best I've ever encountered.  I was skeptical about the use of mint, but it was the icing on the cake - just a tiny hint that was noticeable but beautifully in tune.  The lamb was served with simple saut\u00e9ed vegetables and roasted potatoes which were homey and well-cooked.\n\nMy order was the brodeto de pesse a la Istriana, an Adriatic seafood stew with red wine and balsamic-tomato sauce, served over grilled polenta.  This was not as good as the meatier dishes, but it was still awesome, loaded with shrimp, mussels, and calamari, with earthy grilled polenta to soak up the sauce.\n\nOf the other entrees, I would recommend the arosto de coniglio, sugo in agrodolce con ginepro.  In English, this is braised rabbit with onions, juniper berries, honey, brown sugar, and balsamic, served with polenta.  The rabbit just fell off the bone, and the sauce was divine, with complex developed flavors.  The stinco de videl a la Triestina, a braised veal shank glazed with Burgundy wine and rosemary, was good, but it paled next to the braised rabbit.  If you need your chicken, the peto de polo a la Maraska was a decent sauteed bird breast in a fantastic brandied cherry sauce with whole cherries.  It also came with a gorgeous herb risotto.\n\nFor dessert, we split the panna cotta and a trio of chocolate, strawberry, and mandarin sorbet.  The panna cotta was simple and delicious, with a coulis of port wine and berries.  It was laden with vanilla bean and boasted a smooth thick texture.  The sorbets were all very light and feathery, almost icy but not unpleasantly so.  The desserts were more familiar than the savory fare, but we did well not to skip them.\n\nThe bill was worthy of a nice dinner out but even with wine, it was reasonable, especially given the A+ dining experience.  We were all full and happy when we boarded the trolley back to our hotel.  Albona is the sort of place you leave grinning.", "author": "Steph C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-22", "description": "I am the quintessential foodie.\nIt's not uncommon that there is a restaurant I haven't tried; there are only so many days in a week or year.  It is uncommon, however, that I have not heard about a good restaurant, though.\n\nAlbona Ristorante Istriano is tucked away on a residential street in the North Beach area of San Francisco.  During its business hours, if you didn't know about it, you would drive right by it without even noticing that it was opened for business.  In fact, you could walk right by it and still not know that behind these doors is what I now consider to be one of San Francisco's best dining experiences.\nFor a few years, I've always considered Acquerello to be San Francisco's best-kept secret - but it has now secured its place in the San Francisco dining scene.  My next mission is Albona.\n\nWe are very lucky in San Francisco to have some amazing food available within city limits.  But a recent trend I have noticed in San Francisco is that many of these finer dining establishments offers amazing appetizers and \"second\" entrees, but the main dish is almost consistently sub-par and lackluster compared to the previous courses.  Case in point - \"A16 in the Marina, \"Local\" in SOMA, and even \"DOSA\" in the Mission.\n\nI will say off the bat that Albona hit a homerun for each course.  Istrian cuisine, as it turns out, is simply good food that carries a strong Italian history with a flair not commonly found in Italian food.\n\nFirst, it's a small restaurant that exudes \"family-run operation\".  I imagine the uncle as the chef, the cousins working as servers, and the owner as the host.  While the owner, Michael Bruno, is the host (and server, as needed), I know not if everyone else in the restaurant is actually family.  What I do know is they all, from each individual server to busser, worked together as a family should where each individual had a vested interest in extending the utmost in service.  Watching their interaction with each table like a hawk in preparation for this review - I confirmed once again what I always believed to be true:  when you own a restaurant, you owe it to your business to BE THERE.\n\nIn Albona's case, Michael Bruno isn't just there; he brands that restaurant, and ensures that every representative of his establishment is an extension of himself, and his style.  This extends all the way to the  food.\n\nMy first experience with the owner was on the phone.  I called en route to the restaurant to ask if we'd be seated immediately if we came in ten minutes.  He checked, said yes - and we arrived right on time to see a line of people waiting in the small front area.  Due to having after-dinner plans, I started getting worried that we'd have to wait, but alas, he came to the front, checked that I was the one who called, and seated us immediately.  Gotta love a man who is true to his word.\n\nThe menu at Albona reads beautifully with Italian names, and English descriptions.  We selected two appetizers and two entrees, and we chose Prosecco as our imbibe of choice for this evening.  We told our server that we'd be sharing and they went the extra mile to split it for us in the kitchen.  It's these touches that catapult a good dining experience into an amazing one.\n\nFirst up was the gnocchi, pan-fried in butter and served amidst the most tantalizingly good brown sauce that has ever graced this tongue of mine.  Not only was the gnocchi interesting and more similar to croquette type texture, the sauce was deep in flavor, but most noticeable was the delicate but ever so noticeable use of cumin in what could have been a basic Italian dish.  One bite and inevitably, our eyes rolled to the back of our heads and we savored each piece.  For something  close to $8, it was a large portion that was split onto two plates - and quite filling.\n\nNext super-star delivered to our table was the stuffed calamari.\nOne order consisted for four nicely sized squid, stuffed silly with an amazing fish concoction consisting of red snapper, salmon, and other goodies.  Every single element of  this dish stood out and was delightful to my tastebuds.  But most stellar was the ever-so-basic but amazingly delicious red sauce that accompanied the perfectly cooked squid.  Consisting of the right amount of acidity, sweetness, and depth, it took every ounce of my being not to slurp the remainder off the plate.  Unlike the deep and heavy flavors of the buttery gnocchi, this dish was light and playful, but every bit as memorable.\n\nThe entrees were superb.  \n\nThe remainder of this review can be found at http://wp.me/pF4av-C - word limitation on Yelp prevents me from posting the whole thing!", "author": "Grace K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-19", "description": "Albona is a quiet, upscale restaurant tucked away in a dark residential neighborhood in North Beach. It's your typical restaurant that you would imagine for your grandparents' anniversary or for a business dinner to which you want to treat your most valuable 50-year-old clients. Frankly, it's for the older crowd (ages 50-99). There's a lack of excitement and that wow factor that only the older crowd would be satisfied with completely.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I thought it was a very good dinner. I enjoyed my braised veal shank with soft polenta very much -- it was as tender as an infant cow can be, and the polenta was great. Could it have been a bit tastier? Yeah, it definitely could have been a little sweeter and more flavorful. I tried a bit of the rabbit, which I thought was much tastier than my veal shank -- I probably should have gotten that.\n\nWe had a pretty good waiter -- recommended a great wine for us (the Montepulciano red wine) and checked up on us quite frequently. I was impressed with a busboy who helped us out by giving us a bowl of baking soda & club soda for a red wine accident.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my dinner, but I wasn't excited by it. There was nothing astounding -- it all just seemed very safe and boring, something that I think only those in my grandfather's age bracket can truly be satisfied with. I know it's fancy and upscale, but that should never be synonymous with \"boring\".\n\nIt's one of those restaurants where you have good food with good wine at good prices -- and then you leave and the entire experience just melts away into the darkest corners of your subconscious. If you ever hear the word \"Albona\" again, you think: \"Oh, I think I went there once. I remember it was good.\" But you never really remember the experience, you just remember that you may have thought it was good. \n\nIt's a restaurant for those of you who want a simple, elegant meal without all the fireworks and all the wow. And there's nothing wrong with that. You may even prefer that over all the white noise of hip and chic -- fusion this and neo-contemporary that. Then this restaurant is for you.\n\nIt's just not a restaurant that you scream at the top of your lungs for and definitely not a restaurant that you recommend to your out-of-towner friends who are dying to see what the SF food culture is all about. The reason is because there is a similar restaurant that exists in every city across America. When you take any out-of-town visitor to Albona, chances are they're saying: \"Oh there's this wonderful place in my city that's just like this!\" And they're probably right.", "author": "Roy C."}

We arrived for our 7:30 reservations on time, handed our keys to the free valet (what a godsend in SF!), but did not get seated until nearly 8.  While this usually annoys me greatly, they were apologetic and attentive, giving us complimentary wine while we waited.\n\nThe restaurant itself is small and cozy, giving the impression you're in someone's house.  While the booth seats were a bit too close, allowing you to hear other people's conversation and vice versa, I was mostly comfortable.\n\nBruno, as mentioned by other Yelpers, was a delight.  He came by and gave us detailed descriptions of the minestrone and fish (neither of which we ended up ordering).  We ordered the gnocchi (superb, tasted like it had a faint Indian influence, really interesting), and the braised sauerkraut.  Then I remembered I don't actually like sauerkraut.  But the sausage on top of it was good, and this was probably the best sauerkraut that I have had?\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the stuffed pork loin (excellent) and veal shank (also great, not as good as pork loin).  The pork loin came with a side of red cabbage, that tasted sauerkraut-ish, as in it was kind of sour.  I'm not sure I like this much sour/sweet in my food, but overall I was pretty pleased.\n\nWe passed on dessert, and Bruno called the valet to get our car ready, and then escorted us outside, asking us to please join them again.  I soo appreciated that.  Our car was ready and waiting for us as he opened the door.  For $83 (2 appetizers + 2 entrees + tip + valet tip), not too shabby.", "author": "Liz L."}

We've eaten at Albona several times in the past, and have never been disappointed by the quality of their food or the warm, gracious service of their entire staff.  Our experience this past weekend was no exception.\n\nSam, the executive Chef and owner has to be one of the most engaging, caring restaurant owners in The City.  Making a point to personally greet each guest, the dining experience at Albona is more akin to dining at a friend's home, than it is at a restaurant.  We have always been warmly welcomed, the menu and specials are carefully explained, and then Sam and the staff make sure that the service and dining experience is exemplary.  \n\nThe quality of the Italian/Croatian cuisine is exceptional, as is the presentation of each dish.  I won't go into the details of every dish ordered at our table for 7, however everyone was effusive with praise for the cuisine.  You will find plenty of restaurants that charge the same or more money for the privilege of dining, but you won't find better food or a more welcoming experience anywhere in the City!   \n\nDon't forget to order desert, either!

Location won't blow you away-- on a residential street, but their food and service certainly will. The servers really try to provide great service and I appreciate that. We ordered veal shank and the rack of lamb. The veal shank just melted in my mouth. I would certainly go and ask them to go light on the gravy the next time around. Now... the rack of lamb... oooh so good. I don't usually enjoy lamb, I find it gamy and the aftertaste sometimes too overwhelming. Albona's lamb was cooked to perfection and it was hardly gamy. The star of the dish had to be the puree/ the sauce. I wanted to take the puree from the lamb dish and pour it over my veal. I didn't, but I imagine it would have been scrumptious. We also ordered the crab salad as an appetizer and the tiramisu for dessert. Both were tasty. \n\nThe night was cold and they have a curtain that divides the restaurant from the entrance so if you get chilly easily, I would suggest asking for a table further in. I also suggest making reservations. It was a full house on a Sunday night at 8pm. \n\nStreet parking is possible, but valet is complimentary! (No valet on Sundays)", "author": "Rosa L."}

Daringly, 21 years ago Bruno Viscovi opened Albona, named for his home town on the culturally complex Istrian Peninsula and featuring the foods of that region located on the Northern Adriatic Sea near Trieste.\n\n           Viscovi was certainly taking a chance opening a restaurant across the street from some of the most dilapidated and crime ridden public housing in the city. (The projects have now been replaced by the spiffy subsidized housing of North Beach Place.) I visited this restaurant in the late 80s and was very impressed with the food and the intimacy of the space. Bruno came to your table and told you the tale of his family's history of food and how many of the recipes were drawn from Bruno's memory growing up in Albona. It was the restaurant's location, not the quality of the food that I worried about. They will never make it, I told myself after each satisfied visit. But the restaurant did make it, appearing regularly on the San Francisco Chronicle's list of 100 Best Bay Area Restaurants. \n \n          After twenty years of running this very successful restaurant, Bruno Viscovi retired. His nephew, Michael Bruno, who had worked every job in the restaurant but cook long before he began to shave, took over. Michael brought on as his partner Viscovi's chef, Samuel Hernandez who had worked at many famous local restaurants, including Bix in our neighborhood. It was the freedom of being Michael's partner that expanded Samuel's ideas. The recipes have stayed the same but the presentation has been brought to a new level.\n\n          In a way, Michael emulates his uncle as he talks to diners at each table, welcoming them. \"Unlike my uncle, I didn't grow up in Istria, so my stories are different,\" Michael said. \"Mine are of the history of the years I have worked and been around Albona.\"\n\n           Tasting the four different appetizers we ordered, the mushroom soup was the standout. It has a stock of chicken and prosciutto, reduced. Yellow onions and Yukon Gold potatoes are added to form this rich, creamy soup that surprisingly has no cream. If you are a mushroom lover, this is your dish. Michael tells me the most popular appetizer is a recipe from his grandmother, pan fried potato gnocchi, with a brown, cumin laced, sirloin sauce. When the dish arrived, the gnocchi were so brown, I thought the dish must be overcooked, but the crunchy outside split to reveal a soft potato inside. Michael said, \"My girlfriend calls these Pillows of Heaven\". Swirl them in the rich sirloin sauce and \nyou'll get her point.\n\n        One of the signature pasta dishes at Albona is the strudel con pasta fatta in casa. This creamy dish speaks of Bruno's search for the perfect ingredients to replicate his ancestors' recipes. After trying many cheeses, he found that a Finnish cheese called Lappi worked the best for melting.  In a 550 degree oven, the cheese never turns stringy or dry, creating a devine texture. The fresh pasta rolls are stuffed with Lappi and proscuitto and covered with a creamy, buttery tomato sauce. Toasted bread crumbs and b\u00e9chamel are added prior to baking. This incredible pasta dish can easily be shared, as it is a generous portion for a dish this intense.\n\n         One of my favorite dishes at this restaurant is the Fish of the Day. The evening we went, it was halibut. I was surprised at the generous portion of fish that almost filled the plate, a thick piece of fillet cooked to perfection, the outside golden brown, the inside moist and flavorful. It was served with a delicate white wine, shallot and butter sauce. I liked the small platter of steamed vegetables served separately. Usually unembellished vegetables like this are not particularly tasty, but these were the perfect compliment to this wonderfully prepared simple entree. \n\n        One of my hard and fast rules about a restaurant is, \"If the bread is no good, the food is not going to be good.\" Albona's dinner rolls pass my test. Made fresh daily by Chef Samuel's wife, Beatriz, they are among the best I have had in the City. Beatriz also makes the desserts. One of her specialties--from an old Istrian recipe-- is the apple strudel, served with vanilla ice cream. When it was brought to the table, its aroma arrived first. The dessert's apples and nuts are infused with sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest and rum, then tucked in a strudel,\n\n        Congratulations to Michael and Samuel (and Uncle Bruno) on the 21st anniversary at Albion. Thank you for having this unique, special restaurant in our neighborhood. Your little hideaway on Francisco Street may be easy to miss, but the locals who love great food aren't going to forget you.", "author": "Carol P."}

It was way more than enough food for all of us.\n\nHere is the quick breakdown:\nAppetizers:  scallops (the best appetizer of the night...so good...), gnocchi (I wanted more!), and calamari (delicious and slightly spicy)\n\nPasta (BTW, pretty big portions):  seafood risotto (decent) and seafood linguine (I enjoyed this more and there was a lot of seafood in it too)\n\nEntree:  rabbit (sweet and not tough) and rack of lamb (nice crust on the outside and tender meat)\n\nDessert:  dark chocolate flan (super rich in a good way) and gelato (more subtle, but tastes just right).

We were going to watch a show at Cobb's a little later in the evening.\n\nWe ordered the Minesetre stagionali ( soup of the day.) Today it was a cream of asparagus with tomato soup; but no cream was used, instead they used Yukon gold potatoes. The soup tasted light and very fresh. Delish! Then we ordered a yelp fav: Calamai al forno con salsa marinara (squid stuffed with toasted bread crumbs, parsley & garlic; roasted in an amazing, with just a hint of spiciness, marinara sauce.)  We took some of our fresh sourdough bread to scoop up the sauce, but had to restrain ourselves to save room for our entrees.\nI got the wild boar pappardelle. It was good and not too heavy. We had tried the same dish at Firenze by NIght also, which was also good, but a much more savory dish, more sauce heavy.  Tony got the Stinco de videl a la Tristina (AMAZING Braised veal shank with Burgndy wine and rosemary glaze with soft polenta). This was so delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful, the meat fell off the bone. Dessert: Crema de gelato (a light as air Triple cream gelato mousse topped with Maraska cherries in Brandy - the gelato was Espresso and Vanilla, it tasted like a tiramisu mouse. YUM)\n\nThe food was great. The service was great also. The owner Michael Bruno took the time to talk to each table, whether it be newbies like us, or to the regulars. The service is attentive and nice. There were 2 elderly lady-regulars celebrating a birthday. One of them ordered the lamb, and she didn't like that it was undercooked (medium rare). So MIchael took the dish back and had them re-cook it. When she got impatient, she told them that if it still wasn't ready that she didn't want it anymore. So Michael brought out a brand new lamb for her, and apologized that it time for them to cook a new one. All the while you can hear the servers say \"What can you do? You gotta keep the regulars happy.\" The regulars got risotto con funghi compliments of the chef, and an extra dessert with a candle (the panna cotta) in addition to their strudel because the candle would have melted in the hot strudel. You can't ask for better service than that.\n\nThis is a small intimate dinning room. The staff is friendly and attentive. The valet service is complimentary, and Michael knew which car belonged to us!

Not your conventional Italian with belligerently heavy pasta, endless canned tomato sauce and flavorless cheese. Istrian food is a fusion of Italian, Croatian and Austrian, even some Greek/Eastern Mediterranean elements.  Istria is on the sea and tucked in between all of those.  (Here's Albona today http://www.istra.com/rabac/eng/labin.asp).  The food reflects the region which is a cross-roads of all of these people and places.\n\nStart with the stuffed squid, then lamb noisettes and don't pass on the desserts, especially the (strudel de pomi) - home made apple strudle.  Everything on the menu is a home cooking recipe, the way grandma made. Not some corporate chef inspired fabrication. Now since we are nowhere near the fresh daily catch from the Adriatic Sea or delicious fruit and tasty meats from around the town of Albona, you have to accept what California grown ingredients can deliver. And that's not bad. \n\nReservations are a must. Books up fast. Small and cozy. Best suited for parties of 2-4, but I've had parties of as big as 13 there. Avoid bringing a large crowd because you'll overwhelm the kitchen and miss out. It's quality not quantity at Albona. It's always busy and the small staff can get busy fast. But, this is a family operation and Michael, that's there hands-on every day, is awesome and will make sure you have the best service. \n\nI love this place.\n\nA San Francisco classic.

Seeing a 4.5 star review on yelp set this place up for great expectations.  \n\nLet me start off by saying, we did have a very nice time.  The waiters were great and spent time telling us about their favorite wine pairings and attending to us nicely.  The atmosphere was cozy and relaxed.\n\nThe main disappointment must have been the veal that both boys ordered - it was a sadly presented sliver of meat that left much to be desired.  this was served with a side of sauteed mushrooms that also screamed for want of taste.\n\nOther dishes were decent: the 4 pieces of lamb chops were done just right with a nice stack of eggplant/potato acompaniment.  I wasn't in ecstasy over them though and I would have liked to be for $27.  The veal shank over polenta was probably the best dish on the table: a generous, tasty hunk of meat.\n\nFor starters, we tried both risottos: mushroom and prosciutto - both were good, but a little firmer than I like my risotto - both the half and full portions are good sizes, but then again, you're paying entree price for the full.  The soup of the day was a blended asparagus - this I enjoyed.  The fresh bread on the table was good and I liked the texture of the whipped butter - nice and light.  \n\nDessert was a major let down: the strudel de pomi was an unexciting slab of slightly dried out apples in a non-descript crust with a ball of ice cream for $10+. Boo.\n\nAnyway, with the $25 coupon, each of the 4 of us paid $50 for: wine, appetizer, entree, shared dessert and tax and tip.  Slightly overpriced in my opinion.  I would like to try the stuffed pork loin and linguini but I don't know if I really need to go back to this place with so many other places to try.

I read all those wonderful reviews in Yelp and elsewhere and we were really excited about this place. Until we got the appetizers that is ...  Maybe the good things first: Yes, the service is friendly, albeit maybe a little tiny bit unprofessional, but one could call that 'family style'. And yes, free valet parking is great in SF. \n\nWe had the 'Antipasto misto' which were ok, the 'Sardele in saor a la Veneziana' which were good (probably the best dish that night). We also had the 'Chifeleti de mia nona', those Gnocchi-style pan-fried things hailed by many reviewers here as if they were cooked in ambrosia. They are actually quite awful. They are pretty much eight deep-fried balls of mashed potatoes with a lot of sirloin sauce. It took four people to finish them all. Luckily the bottle of Montepulciano was great and pleased us enough to dissolve this disappointment quickly.\n\nThe main dishes were the 'Stinco de videl' (braised veal shank), the 'Peto de polo' (chicken breast), the 'Capriolo a la cacciatora' (venison), and the 'Brodeto de pesse' (Adriatic seafood stew). First, do not expect any vegetables, at most you get some thoroughly cooked ratatouille. Then, do not expect light or particularly fancy sauces: all were heavy, oily, brown sauces, even on the seafood stew was some sort of forest-mushroom sauce (it says red wine, balsamic-tomato sauce in the menu, which we could not identify on our dish). The sauces were so thick and plentiful that we had trouble identifying the venison as such. Additionally,  everything was very, very well cooked, if you know what I mean. After these disappointing entrees we felt we would rather have our espressi and gelati elsewhere and left without trying any deserts, something that rarely happens.\n\nI am not sure what had happened that night. All these praising reviewers here sound, like they had eaten in a different restaurant. Maybe we just do not appreciate Istrian cuisine enough, or the chef had a really bad day, or they just had accidentally purchased a 100 gallon tank of brown sauce base and have to cook it away until the end of the month ... I don't know, but we will not try this again any time soon. It is not bad food, just not good food either.

When I made the reservations the person on the phone did not seemed rushed or drowned out by background noise, which seems to be more and more common when calling restaurants these days--- the fact that he could actually hold a small conversation when telling me about their valentines dinner was a plus.\n\nThey have free valet which is nice (no parking to be found in the area), and the location itself is in a nice small neighborhood. Plus\n\nThe wait staff was all very courteous and nice, and our waiter (michael) did a great job recommending wine. We ordered the calamari stuffed with fish in marinara sauce appetizer, Rissoto con funghi and 3 cheese raviolis for dinner, and gelato and flan for dessert.\n\nThe calamari was out of this world, in my opinion. The squid itself had great texture comlimented by the ground up fish inside. The highlight however was the sauce--- I've never had a simple red sauce taste that good; I made sure to get extra bread just to make sure I could get it all off my plate. The girlfriend didn't seem to like the dish as much though, so YMMV?\n\nThe Risotto con funghi was good but not AMAZING. I'm not exactly sure but it seemed like all they used were normal button mushrooms--- I kind of expected some different types (maybe there were though? I'm no expert...).\n\nThe raviolis were amazing. I'd never had such a blend of flavors in a pasta dish--- the cheeses, nutmeg, raisins, pinenuts--- all were in perfect balance, taking the stage for a moment and then giving way to a new flavor. Fantastic. \n\nDesserts were equally amazing. The gelato was extremely creamy with VERY strong liquer soaked berrys on top. The flan was deliciously rich and left a great chocolate taste that lingered for an hour after the meal. They were even nice enough to comp the flan when they gave us the bill before accidently before realizing we had ordered 2 desserts. \n\nOverall, this is a great place to take someone for an upscale meal. The atmosphere is very comfortable and the food is phenomenal. Also, for the day of the event and what we got, prices were very reasonable. Great job, Albona.", "author": "T A."}

Like this, for instance.\n\nAlbona has always been my go-to place to take people for an amazingly impressive experience.  Fantastic food, excellent ambiance, tiny, intimate, romantic.  Plus, for....a year and half, I've been greeted by name every time I walked in the door.  If you didn't know me, you'd think I was someone important.  This past weekend, I needed a refresher in tiny, intimate and romantic, so it was time to go to Albona.  We were seated, and no sooner had the water been poured than we were given a round of proseco, \"compliments of the house.\"  Now, it had been....almost six months since I had last visited, so I was a bit surprised.  But proseco on a hot day in SF?  Can you say, perfect?  I knew you could!\n\nSeveral minutes afterward, Michael (more in just a second) wandered over, greeted wifey and I by name, and welcomed us back.  Michael then shared the big news: he had recently bought the restaurant from his uncle, Bruno (the founder).  As I told Michael (right that minute, because I am suave like that), that probably didn't increase his workload any, since he was already doing all the work as far as I could ever tell.  Laughs all around.  This is why you invite me to parties: charm, class, and wit.  Also, I usually buy.\n\nMichael walked us through the several changes he and his chef have made to the menu, and all were very positive.  I had the special, a Muscovy duck breast with a cherry glaze, which was excellent.  Wifey had the ravioli, which we couldn't ever remember having before, and was also wonderful.  For dessert, 20-year port and a fresh fruit compote.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: Albona continues to be the most impressive restaurant in SF that you aren't aware of.  On one hand, that suits me just fine, because it means I can continue to get same-week reservations for prime dining spots.  On the other hand, I want to see this place continue to prosper.  So take my advice (for once), and go there.  And tell Michael I sent you---I need more free drinks.", "author": "Ben P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-24", "description": "We must've came on an off night because the food was not as good as what the reviews would indicate.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly staff.  My first impression of the decor was that it was a bit outdated and plain.\n\nWe started off by ordering the soup of the day which was a creamy asparagus soup that is not made with cream.  The waiter told us the creamy texture of the soup was made from pureed potatoes.  There were a few chunks of asparagus and croutons.  The soup was quite unique and tasty.  Next was the arugula  salad with prosciutto.  This salad was actually my favorite dish.  The prosciutto had a nice color and texture to it.  It was kind of fresh yet dried.  Apparently, it had a white truffle vinaigrette in it, which was very good.  So, we're off to a good start.\n\nBut then it kind of fizzled a bit when the main course came around.  Our last two dishes were the penne and  arosto de coniglio aka rabbit.  My friend read in the Yelp reviews that the rabbit was good.  I figured if I was going to eat a cute cuddly little rabbit, it better taste good!  Sad to report that it was the contrary.  I'm sorry little rabbit.  The meat was too dry.  I'm not sure if that's the texture of rabbit meat since it's not something I usually eat, but it had the texture of an overcooked chicken breast.  The seasoning was a bit too sweet for my liking.  The rabbit was served with polenta which tasted and looks like grits to me.  As for the penne, eh, it's penne.  Nothing special.  \n\nLastly came the dessert.  This will either make or break the experience which it did neither.  We got the panna cotta and the tiramisu.  The tiramisu was pretty good, not spectacular, but good.  I didn't know much about the panna cotta since I've never really had it before, but it did not impress.  So, in that sense, the dessert didn't help the cause nor did it hurt it.\n\nOverall, I give this place 3 stars for the food, then add one star for the service, and take one star away for the price to taste ratio so we're back at 3.", "author": "David T."}

Still, if I'm hungry, and I'm sitting there with my menu closed like I'm ready to order, then please, come take my order and let's get this meal going.\n\nThe food was just okay. None of the entrees were interesting, delicious, or well-executed enough to bring us back for a return visit. More specifically, the meat part was usually fine -- well cooked and pretty tasty -- but then taken down a notch by the uninspired, bland side dishes that came with them, like totally tasteless polenta, and the kind of boring, lifeless steamed vegetables that make me think, no wonder Americans hate their veggies. Also, a couple of our dishes came in sauces that had already started to form a crusty layer on top by the time they arrived at the table... honestly, how hard can it be to time the entrees right when we were the first table to be served that evening?\n\nThis also feeds my pet-peeve with higher-end, \"authentic\" Italian restaurants... or I just don't understand them.

It was our first time at this restaurant -- we had tickets to a show in North Beach and picked Albona because it seemed like the only place in North Beach where Yelp reviewers hadn't resoundingly complained about the service and/or food. Albona has pretty consistently positive reviews, and I must say that I totally agree with everyone who raved about this place. \n\nTo start, I had the basic dinner salad (which was perfectly fine but not necessarily anything to write home about). My husband had the fig salad which he loved. I had a little taste and I agree, it was great. Only complaint about it is that it's pretty huge, so if you ate the whole thing, you might spoil your appetite for your entree. Which you really truly don't want to do... we both had the Strudel con pasta fatta in casa  and OMFG it was freaking AMAZING.

The ambiance of the restaurant was very inviting and the service was great from the very start.  It was elegant, but you almost felt as though you were in someone's home because there was a very personal touch to everything they did.\n\nIt was a pre-set menu with four courses that gave us multiple options for each course.  All the dishes were great, but a few stood out as truly amazing.  \n\nFirst off, the Ortolana, or grilled eggplant, was fantastic.  I was a little hesitant since I normally don't like eggplant, but I could have eaten two more of these appetizers by myself.  \n\nFor our entrees, we had the strudel con pasta fatta in casa and stinco de videl a la triestina (veal).  The strudel won the main course battle, but be forewarned, it is VERY RICH and filling.  We were already getting full by the time this dish came around and we were unable to finish it between the two of us.  The flavors from the strudel were great, but it was a little too much to have as your only dish.  I'd recommend sharing this dish with someone else who ordered something different.\n\nFor dessert, we had the crema de gelato and the bonet.  The bonet was good, but the gelato was amazing.  I mean, really, truly amazing.  We were both stuffed already but we somehow managed to finish it.  I don't know how to describe it any other way...you really just have to try it for yourself.\n\nOverall, this was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in recent memory.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and led to my table.  As my habitually late friends didn't get there for another 15 minutes, the wait staff went out of their way to make sure that I was comfortable (offered drinks, gave me a menu to peruse, etc.) while I awkwardly sat by myself at a five person table.  I must have looked like a total loser.  Awesome.\n\nOnce my friends got there, the waiter (who was also the same person who greeted me) told us their specials and got us started with some wine.  He was extremely knowledgeable and had a very cool, relatable personality.  \n\nWhen our food got there, it was soooooo good.  I ordered the pork loin which was fantastic.  My friend who ordered the rack of lamb special was totally in his happy place.  I took a bite (or two or three) of someone else's veal shank which was excellent as well.  To be honest, there wasn't anything that I tried that wasn't delicious.  \n\nTurns out our waiter/greeter is also the owner.

Last time I was here, he was just starting to transition in.

We ended up with:\n\n* Pan-fried gnocchi in brown sirloin sauce - the house specialty.  They melted in our mouths...so good.\n* Peperonata - a mixture of vegetables, capers, olives and raisins.  Definitely good and a little different, but not as memorable as the rest of what we ate.\n* Scallops - they were small and came 4 to an order.  I don't usually like scallops but liked these.\n* Fried sardines - one of my friends said they were the highlight of her night!\n\nAs for entrees, we had several home runs:\n\n* Strudel con pasta fatta in casa - the house specialty of a pasta roll filled with cheese and prosciutto with bread crumbs.  So tasty, so good.\n* Seafood linguini - this is one of the new dishes that Michael added and the dish I ordered.  Simply amazing.  It overflowed with seafood - clams, fish, shrimp, mussels... The sauce was a white wine, tomatoes, garlic and chili and was bit spicy but not overwhelming.  \n\nOther folks ordered the veal shank and seafood stew, but I didn't get a chance to try it since they were at the other end of the table (and I was so focused on my pasta dish!)\n\nWe ordered two desserts, which were fine but not necessarily highlights of the night.\n\nService was simply amazing.  They were attentive and helpful and continued to check in and answer questions about the food throughout the meal.\n\nWith roughly 1 appetizer and 1 entree per person, a couple of desserts and several bottles of wine the meal came to about $60 per person.

Next were the projects across the street. Well that explained the free valet, but sparked important convo and understanding of what was really happening. Over time as we got to know B and his wife (who randomly taught at the school behind dad's casa), it hit me that having his restaurant in a place with no foot traffic, not so desirable surroundings, and cheap rent represented so much more than a dining establishment trying to survive. Albona represented perseverance, cultural diversity, and community awareness in an area in which the city was attempting to hide the unpleasantries. Well Bruno didn't give a shit about unpleasantries and set up shop. Since eating here I never knock a spot based on location, nor do I judge food by the view....I leave that to those real estate folks.\n\nDinners at Albona tended to last at least 3 hours. Between Bruno and my dad it was really hard to get food on the table between their endless chatter. As they reminisced I actually learned a lot about where I come from through food, which is a huge part of why I heart food and travel today.  \n\nOh yeah, the food! Albona's cuisine fuses regional classics from Italy, Croatia and Istria with local Cali ingredients. This results in tasty concoctions I find nostalgic, while heavier than my mom's cooking. We used to fight over the  pan-seared gnocchi, while the melt in your mouth lasagna from homeade pasta, bechemel and prosciutto is responsible for the few extra pounds I gained around age 15 (sooo worth it). Although the menu may have changed, I bet Bruno is still the same crazy, fun, loud, cool man he was back in the day (along with his lovely wife).\n\nThanks Albona for the sweet and savory memories.", "author": "debbie h."}

I found this place on Yelp and all the times I've walked down Taylor, never knew it was here.  \n\nIntimate, warm, homey feeling as I stepped inside.  Wine was very reasonable.  We ordered a bottle of white for $26.  Not bad at all.  The service was awesome 5 stars for sure.  Everyone was super friendly.  I really felt like I was in my Italian Grandma's house eating homemade Italian food.  Too bad my grandmother wasn't a very good cook, nor are we Italian.\n\nWe all ordered something different.  I had the Sausage Rigatoni baked.  This dish was out of this world.  Super hot when it came out.  I could taste the quality and the flavors.  It was just so delicious.  Cheesy, juicy, saucey- Sooooo good.  Others in my group got the halibut (very good), the Risotto (OK but I'm not the biggest Risotto fan), and cheese ravioli (also very good).\n\nWe were so stuffed we couldn't bare to order dessert.\n\nThis place is great date place or/and a small group birthday dinner place.

But the minute we were greeted, I couldn't wait to taste their food. Their dishes are as good as their friendly service!  \n\nThe dishes are regional (from what I understand) italian flavors; very very \"non-standard american\" italian!  I ordered seafood stew as entree, and had calamari, gnochi and scallops as appetizers.  The flavor was light, and not heavy like a lot italian dishes tend to be.   Calamari was sooooo good!\n\nThe service was superb as well!  We order a bottle of wine, but when he uncorked the bottle, he thought the fragrance wasn't right, so he immediately opened up a second bottle for us right away.

I couldn't  have asked for a more enjoyable and tasteful evening. I started with the dungenous crab salad which was yummy! They were very accommodating in splitting this salad for my husband and I to share and they did so making each individual serving look beautiful -- not like they had just split one serving in half.  I had the braised veal shank as my entre -- highly recommend it!!  The meat was extremely tender and full of flavor...it just melted in my mouth.  My husband had the home made ravioli and loved it as well.  Even the dinner rolls were delightful...tasted like there was buttermilk in them...light, warm and great flavor.

Even given the tight space, the table are not crowded and the pace is as leisurely as you want to make it.\n\nThis is not what most people would consider \"eye-talian\" food. They do a couple standard red sauce dishes, but probably only to meet the expectations of dazed tourists who wander in and assume, given its North Beach-centric location that the food is your stereotypical Italian. Not so. \n\nMostly, this menu offers intriguing ingredients like raisins, saffron, and juniper berries. The Istiran region of Italy is more closely related to Vienna than to Palermo, and its ingredients prove this. \n\nThe service was charming - Bruno is not the only employee who really cares about diners. Everyone from our waiter to the valet parking dude were smiling, friendly and genuine. They love working here, and it's a pleasure to eat here.\n\nP.S. Without us even asking, they offered to split our appetizers for us -- and didn't charge us. Plus, if you order wine by the glass, they bring the bottle to your table and pour you a taste before pouring you a full glass. This ensures you'll never have to drink wine from the one bottle that's been open for days. Very cool.", "author": "Maureen G."}

The sardines are a special treat and the rabbit and the sea bass both done to perfection. The rabbit seemed to multiply the more I cut into it.\n\nYet what made our dining experience so special was the knowledge, enthusiasm and levity that is so rare in highly rated restaurants these days. Michael treated my request for a glass of house zin like I had ordered a magnum of Bordeaux and when it came to dessert...he talked us out of a more expensive glass of port to try Passito di Pantelleria, to share with our strudel and panna cotta. WOW is the understatement and I just received 4 bottles  from a vendor in SF to surprise my wife and dinner guests next Christmas.\n\nSo Michael, this is really a thank you to YOU for making a dinner into a memory neither of us will forget. You have to respect a restaurateur who, when he could not talk Linda into having fresh vanilla ice cream with her strudel, replies, \"great, now there is more for me.\"\n\nWe can't wait to return because in a City filled with great restaurants, this one also has a heart, a soul and a great sense of humor.", "author": "John B."}

My BF's father mentioned that he loved the veal dish, but he would go for the lamb dish instead.  Bruno must have overheard our conversation and he gave my BF's father the veal dish as a gift.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-16", "description": "It's a hidden gem from the busy fisherman's wharf, just a few blocks away and very close to the cable car stop. \n\nIt's been a place to earn Michelin recommendation for consecutive 3 years and received a score of 100 for its cleanness. It must not be easy and there are good reasons for all of these. \n\nImpressed by their menu written in Istrian and the cozy inside decorations, we decided to try their insalatina mista, Strudel con pasta fatta in casa and risoto de speck con zaferan. The salad was simple but you could tell the high quality of veggies used. My risoto was full of prosciutto and saffron flavor. I cooked ristoto and definitely appreciated the efforts and time making a good risoto. The pasta looked filling on the menu but it actually wasn't! It's light, tasteful and also very special. \n\nBased on the owner's recommendation, we ordered the a delectable gelato mousse and the panna cotta. Both were great!!! The panna cotta was very soft and full of Mascarpone cheese flavor. The gelato was similar to iced expresso coffee. It's hard to choose which one was our most favorite. \n\nThe service, including the waiter, owner, busboy was so friendly.

I had the veal shank and pollenta. It was a little salty and not very hot. I was unimpressed. I tried some of my husbands pork with saurkraut and that wa much better than what I was eating.

Therefore, this review doesn't mention authenticity or bringing me back to memories of summer Italian travels.  Instead, I'll talk about general flavors and presentation.  \n\nWe ordered only one appetizer, the peperonata (mix of veggies in olive oil).  While the flavors were good (not too salty, not overly seasoned), the small serving of veggies was definitely not worth $9.\n\nFor the main course, we had 4 different entrees: penne a la \"arrabbiata\", braised veal shank with soft polenta, stuffed pork loin, and the halibut special.  The meat in the dishes were overall well cooked and pretty flavorful.  I think the pork loin was a little bit dry, but the veal was tender and the halibut was moist.  Unfortunately, the sides and sauces were lacking.  On a few dishes, the sauces had formed a dry crust on top and you definately had to break through the dried top layer of the soft bland polenta.  The penne was just barely warm on top and couldn't melt the pre-grated parmasean that was sprinkled on top.  The veggie side that came with the halibut was also kind of odd... just steamed and arranged on a little plate (literally, some in rows). \n\nService, though polite, was slow and incorrectly timed (as demonstrated by the dry sauces/polenta and luke-warm penne).  This could have been excused if we'd been eating during a busy time, but we were there for the 1st seating (5pm) and only two other tables had customers.", "author": "Iris Y."}

Right away they took our coats and gave us a nice welcome.\nThe food on the other hand was not up to the $400. (6 in party). We don't mind paying good money for a nice meal, but was disappointing.\nStuffed pork tenderloin (highly recommended by waiter) was dry,tasteless and appeared to be precooked and reheated. Lamb loin was also seemed to be precooked and overly spiced for our tast, both these dishes could be cooked to order in the time it took to be served.\nThe fish stew was good, but the was filled with (cheaper) calimari ($29).\nAfter reading reviews on Yelp, I'm assuming we came on a night that the chef was off!\nIt's a good thing we spent the rest of the evening at BeachBlanketBabalon!\nTo be fair $400 included 2 $40 bottles of wine and 3 deserts, but we only had salad and entree courses.\nOn a Saturday night I would expect better!", "author": "Chris P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-29", "description": "Fantastico. I came here with my girlfriend and her cousin while she was in town. We had two appetizers, two glasses of wine, main courses, two desserts, as well as a bottle of sparkling wine. It came to $150. Add a tip, and it came to $190 for three people for a three course meal with wines. \n\nThe decor is nice, the restaurant is a little small although I did not feel intruded upon by other diners at any time. The menu is small, and apparently varies somewhat frequently. It was a very pleasant experience, with frequent attention but never overbearing, although it did take the waiter quite a while to ask how our meals were after receiving the dishes(luckily for him they were great).\n\nI would definitely come here again for a special occasion. I don't think I'd come alone. Overall, one of the best restaurants I've eaten at, and I would expect the minor faults to be acceptable at this price range. \n\nNow, for the menu items we had:\n\nAppetizers: \n\n-Sardele in saor a la Veneziana - fillets of fried sardines with glazed onions. Very good and light, with a fresh seafood taste. Sweet onions and raisins offset the vinegar marinade nicely. The fish itself was a little dry.\n\n-Tomatoes in reduced balsamic - An offf-menu special that was basically beefsteak tomato slices in a reduced balsamic sauce, which was slightly sweet. Nice and refreshing, and was nice beside the sardines. A little simple, but delightful.\n\nMain Courses (which I sampled):\n\nCostolette de aniel - Mustard and herb crusted lamb, with potato and eggplant and pesto napoleon. The lamb was perfectly cooked, with the crust adding good crunch against the soft meat. There was a bit more fat on the lamb than I find ideal, leaving me with a forkful of fat no matter how I sliced it in the end. Despite being simple in appearance, the potato and eggplant side had all the flavor of lovingly roasted home cooked vegetables. This was my entree. \n\nPaired with:  Petite Sirah - EOS '06 Reserve - (Paso Robles, CA). I'm afraid I'm not a wine connoisseur, but this was a nice dry red wine, with some berry flavor I think, and it complimented the meal nicely. \n\nPenne a la \"arrabbiata\" - Tomatoes in spicy garlic butter and basil sauce over penne. I only had a small sample of this dish. The penne was dangerously close to being undercooked, and the sauce was a bit strong. To be fair, I was tasting it after the fatty lamb, so I probably got an unpleasant blast of acid flavor comparatively. My girlfriend, who had the dish, enjoyed it.\n\nPeto de polo a la Maraska - chicken breast in brandied Marasaka cherry sauce served with herb risotto. Again, I only had a mouthful of this dish. The chicken was moist, cooked perfectly, and the sauce had nice sweetness. The risotto was cooked perfectly, and to quote Iron Chef, \"It's like someone opened my mouth and stuffed a fistful of herbs in it.\" A burst of surprising flavor, along with a perfect texture. \n\nDessert: \n\nBonet - Amaretto flan. A delicious flan. Nothing else need be said.\n\nCrema de gelato - Triple cream gelato mousse with Marasaka cherries. I had this, despite the fact I know I don't like gelato or mousse. The cherries were delicious, and the gelato was good as well, with a nice coffee flavor. \n\nWine: MOSCATO d'ASTI - (Piemonte) - Michele Chiarlo, Nivole '06. A nice sparkling moscato wine, light and citrusy. Went well against the sweet chocolate desserts.", "author": "Paul H."}

He welcomed us despite our casual clothing when we spontaneously decided to check out Albona after a day spent wandering around SF. Unfortunately, some of the servers have attitude that detracts from the tone he sets.\n\nFood is interesting, Northern Italian fare, but is loaded with salt. The texture of their signature gnocchi is the best we've had, but the last time we went, we had a veal shank that must have come from an aging cow.

We chose to celebrate my birthday here Friday evening (all the way from San Diego) based on Yelp and TripAdvisor reviews.  What a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived.  We were immediately served 2 glasses of champagne with a Happy Birthday greeting.  The restaurant is small, cozy and romantic and we had fabulous service the whole evening.  Sam, the owner, came out to our table and offered to help us choose a white wine, since they have some very unusual varieties that we are not familar with.  He opened one from Slovenia (my Grandfather's birthplace) for us to try, which we didn't care for...no problem, he opened another from Croatia that we really enjoyed.  We started with a wonderful appetizer to share and they served incredible rolls that I swear are homemade.  My husband had chicken in the yummiest sauce I've ever tasted.  I ordered the fish of the day, a halibut that melted in your mouth.  They offered us the dessert menu, but we declined.  A few minutes later, they served us a complimentary gelato with a birthday candle.  Throughout the evening, you could see Sam all over the dining room, greeting people, helping with food service, refilling wine glasses.  We were so well taken care of, without the service being obtrusive.  Our only regret is that we didn't eat here the 1st night so we could have gone back a second time.  They were very busy and all of the tables were full, so definitely make a reservation.  We can't wait to go back to San Francisco so we can make another visit to this wonderful restaurant.", "author": "Linda G."}

I went with a party of 6 and we made a reservation ahead of time which I recommend because it is a small restaurant. We all like to share food so we ordered several dishes and ate family style. We had two salads: one with arugala, apples, prosciutto in a white truffle vinaigrette. This one was good but the truffle oil was a little overpowering for my taste. The second one had figs and fontina cheese. This one was so delicious. We ordered the pan fried gnocchi appetizer which everyone seemed to really like. We had mushroom risotto which was prepared perfectly. We had the strudel pasta rolled with prosciutto in a tomato cream sauce. We had the ravioli stuffed with raisins, pinenuts, cheese and nutmeg. This was one of my favorite things. I could have eaten a whole plate to myself easily. We also oreder a rabbit dish. I couldnt bring myself to try the rabbit but I tried the sauce it was cooked in and it was yummy. Everyone else really like this dish. We also had the salmon special which was good. I read the reviews on yelp before we went and saw that a few people said the tirimisu was dry. We ordered it and it was not dry at all. It was actually some of the best I have had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-11", "description": "Five stars easy! I would never expect to find such a unique restaurant, especially in the redundant North Beach neighborhood.  Although this place has an Italian flair, do not be mistaken, it's actually Istrian!  It's heavily influenced by the Italy because of the large population of Italians there, but it's located in Croatia.  As a result, the cuisine is like nothing else around.  I would describe it as a mix of Italian, German and Eastern European cooking.  I got the grilled eggplant with melted cheese and it was soooo rich and delicious.  For my entree, I got the pork loin and the combination of flavors from the meat, sauerkraut and cooked fruits was lovely.  My only complaint was that the meat was a little dry.  If I get to go again I will try either one of the seafood or red meat dishes.  The sauteed red cabbage that came with my entree tasted more like beets, so if you don't like beets, beware. For dessert, I had the chocolate torte, which was creamy and chocolaty, as promised.  \n\nAlbona is a family owned restaurant and they don't just own it, they run it too.  Bruno, the head honcho, entertains the guests, fills your water glass, and develops a relationship with every table.  The main server is his nephew who is also friendly, funny and welcoming.  \n\nThis restaurant is not large or modern.  It's cozy and has a European country feel, which makes for a rather relaxed feel.  Even though you will not feel the slightest bit of pretension or fancy-shmancy stress, I wouldn't come here in sneakers and a sweat-shirt.

The food was excellent and interesting, and the wine went down easy. I left beaming.\n\nAs for the second outing, a Wednesday night: There are a few things I demand in a restaurant, and steamy, hot food is one of them. Kudos for the warm bread rolls, though I would have preferred something crustier. The potato gnocchi in a brown gravy flavored with bits of beef were served almost too quickly, and merely warm, but not piping, a real shame since these conditions made the potato croquettes seems gummy and overly salted. It made me believe that the unusual dumplings had been quickly reheated on the stove and whisked to the table.Not to be finicky, but I would have rather waited the extra 5 minutes for food hot enough to convince me some Nonna had shaped them just for me.\n\nSalt was an issue, it turns out. The beef shank over soft polenta was good, though I again wished the meat had been hotter. The polenta was hot and delicious, though halfway through my meal the predominant taste in my mouth was salt. Thankfully the red wine cut through some of the sodium-- had it really been this saliferous before? Suddenly I didn't feel it was worth the $75 for two price tag anymore.\n\nI'll try Albona one more time, but it'll have to be a night when Bruno's around. He may just well be the restaurant's secret ingredient, the one without which Albona would just be another over-esteemed North Beach dining room.", "author": "Jessica D."}

The people before us didn't want to leave. yak yak yak. Humans like to talk. The wait staff was cool and asked if we wanted a glass a wine while we waited. We ordered a bottle because we weren't driving, and we like to drink wine.\nThe wait person had an Italian accent and was very nice. Italians in Italy are pretty cold, especially in Rome, so we were happy that our server was so cool, kind and happy. But its not really about the service when I go out, it's the food. My wife and I had two different pasta dishes and they were good, not fantastic out of this world good but good. I had the three cheese ravioli and my wife had a lasagna dish, it was better than mine.\nWe also shared two appetizers which were also good, not great. The asparagus with kalamata olives and shaved parmesan was one and the pan-fried potato gnocchi in brown sirloin sauce. I was hoping the pan-fried potato gnocchi was going to blow may taste buds away into another world but it didn't happen.\nI don't know if I need to come back here but I think I will give it another try in search of pasta nirvana.

We started with the gnocchi, which were more like tater tots -- light and airy, with a crisp exterior. Great texture and flavor. Shane had pork (with Bacon? I can't remember-- we were there in May) which he thoroughly enjoyed, and I had the rabbit with juniper berries, which was tender AND chewy, sweet and savory, complex and earthy. It had good sauce! The juniper was a perfect accompaniment. I might say this was the best main dish I've ever enjoyed, and I've been around.

My reservation was at 8:30 & didn't get seating until after 9 pm. There was no hostess. The waiter kept forgetting my name and my party & asked 3 different times what was our party's name was under. The waiter offered free soup to other tables that were waiting long, but not ours. Took over 45 mins for us to get our entrees and we ONLY ordered entrees. Our waiter NEVER checked up on us. Our bread basket, butter, and water were empty and we had to asked for more. ADDITIONALLY, they got my order wrong & had to wait another 20 mins for my entree to come out. I will, forever, never go back to restaurant. They deserve a negative star. The food doesn't make up for the service. For such a classy restaurant, I expected MUCH more especially since it has 4+ stars on Yelp. This, by far, is one of my worst life time experiences at a nice restaurant. I recommend going to Acquerello, Spork, Commis, Chez Panisse, Wood Tavern, EOS, Cassis or Roy's. These restaurants are consistent with their service.", "author": "Shelley L."}

We live in Marin and regularly make the trek to the city when friends come to town to enjoy the food and feeling of the restaurant.  The restaurant is small and because of that people who want distance from other diners may not enjoy Albona as much as we do.  \n\nThis time I enjoyed the ravoli.  I tend to get something different every time.  Last time I got the Gnocchi and loved it.  Their braised veal shank is excellent.  We took some friends a couple of weeks ago and their 7 year old ate his \"first rabbit\" and loved it.  \n\nThe wines are reasonable.", "author": "Bryce L."}

Small intimate setting in a low key location.  \n\nMy husband and i were staying in the city for a little get-a-way and wanted a good night of good food.  We found this on yelp and decided to try it out.  I love italian food and this place did not disappoint. The bread basket came with 2 kinds of bread.  A sourdough and a soft roll(my personal favorite) that are great on there own but even better for soaking up all of the delicious sauces from the various dishes. We ordered the pan fried gnocchi.  Amazing!  Then for the dinner we both ordered the strudel con pasta fatta in casa, a fresh pasta roll stuffed with prosciutto and cheeses, then baked in a casserole that's breaded and topped with tomatoes. Served in a creamy tomato sauce.     \nI love to cook and i wish I had the recipes for both dishes.  A little note, this is not a \"hat wearing\" kind of restaurant.  We felt a little under dressed in our hats, jeans and converse. The very nice host offered to take our coats and hats for us was our first clue.", "author": "Lisa D."}

Why that when you can have something interesting, Istrian, and new?! I've been a handful of times, and my most recent trip the other weekend was by far the best. New owner Michael Bruno, taking over from his Uncle, continues to set the bar high for his unique cuisine, terrific personal service, and warm atmosphere. Growing up and now working in an independent family business, I enjoy supporting the same elsewhere. It's a wonderful place to bring a date with its small, intimate setting and the valet parking is a nice touch.

Los Altos, CA insincere guy I had to write a review.  I was just there with my husband two Saturdays ago and I have to tell you this guy doesn't even know what he is talking about.  I have been going here for the past 10 years and I have NEVER had a problem.  This is a very mellow restaurant that makes the dining experience super cozy.  It is true that you see a lot of older, mature diners but that should be a good sign, right?  It means that the flavor of the food is consistent and doesn't change.  The only problem I have is that I'm so full when I leave.  This last time we went, we had the asparagus soup was very light and flavorful.  The Insalatina mista was simple but tasty.   We then had the Granzo a la tartara freddo - my husband's weakness. I then had the Strudel con pasta fatta in casa and it was out of this world.  IT WAS AMAZING!  Every time I tell people what I had at Albona, I actually smile just reminiscing the incredible delicious taste it left in my mouth ; ), that's when you know it's good.   My husband had the Linguine con granzo e pesse, salsa de pomodoro fresco e aio and he really liked it.  But again, our love was for the strudel.  We tried 3 different desserts, the crema de gelato, the raspberry sorbet and the Panna cotta.  I recommend the crema de gelato to those who like espresso and because the cherries soaked in brandy are delish.  The Panna Cotta is enough reason to want to come just for that.  Our server who's name is Jesus was very pleasant and attentive to our needs.  One of the owners made a point to come and speak to us to make ensure that everything was good.  We got to talk to the other owner, who is the Chef and his wife and both are very down to earth.  As you can see by the majority of the reviews given to this restaurant, this guy Robert T doesn't know what he's talking about.  He is a rude, condescending, ignorant man!  If you have never been here, you should try it out.  If your previous experience wasn't deserving of a 5 star, I would recommend trying it again.

Tried Harris, Ruth Chris, The House, Gary Danko etc... nothing for my time slot. So finally I get reservations here at Albona. Valentines Day saved. Their prix fixe menu was pretty good. The entrees' looked really good on the menu and wished we could've ordered more than one item. The wifey chose the Mushroom soup, The eggplant appetizer and for the main course she had the Ravioli in white sauce. I had the prosciutto mixed greens, Stuffed Calamari and the braised Veal. The wait staff and the valet folks were extra nice. Pretty pleased so far then they started us off with a fried Gnocchi which was a nice touch with some bread. I almost sent it back to say we didn't order this, but my devilish side said hell eat it, it's here already. The salad was ok but I loved the mushroom soup and my braised veal with rosemary served with polenta. The polenta was alright, if I were to combine this great veal with some creamy mash and sauteed' broccolini it would have really made this dish great. It just lacked greens but the Veal was the high light for me. Wife didn't have enough room for the ravioli. We capped off the evening with some dessert as she had the Chocolate Flan and I had the Gelato and both were excellent they even brought out some champagne infused chocolate truffles that resembled either giant dried prunes or rocks you'd throw into a lake. Looks are deceiving, they were quite good. These guys really emphasized service but our food came out a little slow but hey it was valentine's day and I get it...it's about building the romance and ambiance so they hit a triple at that at bat.

I brought a couple of friends with me and we sat in the center of the restaurant.  Overall, the ambiance is quite nice, not too noisy, not too quiet, but well balanced.  It's a pretty small restaurant, so it's easy to feel cozy and removed from the busier parts of North Beach/Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nHaving recently eaten at Chinoise on Main in Los Angeles, where the famous Wolfgang Puck (it's his second LA restaurant after Spago) dropped by our table to thank us for eating at his restaurant (I was shocked to meet him for the first time since I assumed he was too busy, and famous, to greet fellow patrons eating there), you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to have Sammy, the owner of Albona, drop by our table to greet us!  We told him our engagement was the reason for celebration and he immediately provided us with complimentary champagne for me and my guests.  Sammy also took the time to explain to us the menu and his opinions on the different dishes.  I think we ended up ordering over a dozen or so dishes (apps, entrees, dessets) for five people and I have to say that I was impressed with the food there.  If you're willing to try new and different dishes, I think you will be pleased to find that there are several options to enjoy creative dishes.    Here are a several I tried:\n\n1.  Chifeleti - Delicious and unique.  If you haven't tried pan-friend potato gnocchi, you should try this homemade dish that's made from scratch. \n2.  Insalata di Asparaghi - I'm not a huge salad fan, but I enjoyed this dish.  It's fairly simple and straightforward.\n3.  Lamb Chops - Delicious.  I like my meats cooked rare in general, but had this dish cooked medium-rare and the flavor was quite nice.  The napoleon was excellent and complimented the dish well.\n4.

We searched for an Italian restaurant in North Beach to be near a show we were going to later.  I just wish we could have spent longer there.  I had a fig salad with goat cheese and walnuts in a red wine reduction dressing that was wonderful...never tasted anything like it.  My husband had their tomato soup which he said was the best he had ever had.  We were sitting next to this older couple and the gentleman kept talking about how he'd been coming to this restaurant for years and how everything on the menu was wonderful and he knew the family that runs it.  He ordered us a small portion of the strudel which was to die for!  I had the veal shank with polenta which was great.  My husband had their rib eye which literally melted in his mouth.  They are also known for their rabbit dish which I would get if I ever get the opportunity to go again.  It's a very small cozy place; great service.  Don't miss it!", "author": "Dianne C."}

My husband is a 'foodie' and we both loved Albona - as did our family and friends. \n\nThe food is exquisite, and a bargain for the quality and satisfaction. The small space (it's easy to pass by) is intimate and chic, and simple. A few steps up to the tiny bathroom reminds you you're in the city in an old place - valet parking is a godsend. Staff are responsive, kept our glasses topped off, were knowledgeable, and never pushy. Mike is a delight, and gives great advice when asked. (These are his family recipes, and he knows them well.) \n\nThe food reminds us of our trip to Europe/Slovenia - where the influence of Italy, Austria and Slavic traditions make what we call fusion here. We particularly loved the reduction sauces, and how each dish was unique and savory. We've gone twice, with over a dozen dishes tried, and recommend the Alamos Malbec 2007 - a fabulous red at a great price. \n\nThis place is a treasure. If your hungry group can't decide where to go, try this - it satisfies the Italian urge, the Austrian/German urge, and the gourmand will leave thinking you've chosen brilliantly.

My entree was the prosciutto strudel pasta, and it was BY FAR the most delicious entree I've ever ordered any Italian restaurant in the city.

Looking for a great Italian restaurant, I referred to my favorite site, YELP! The owner, Michael Bruno, was able to seat the 3 of us even though we did not have a reservation (we arrived before 6pm). We dined in a very intimate atmosphere and were treated royally. We started our meal with Michael's grandmothers' speciality: pan fried potato gnocchi in brown sirloin sauce. Divine! We cleaned the plate of remaining sauce with our bread! My husband, Brad, savored the braised rabbit with polenta. All he could say was \"wonderful\"! My son, Dane, had the Adriatic stew of fish. The sauce was delicate enabling the uniqueness of each fish flavor on the palate. Awesome! I had the pasta strudel that was rich and creamy. I cleaned my plate! We ordered a bottle of wine from Croatia which was heavenly. The wine was so versatile that it accompanied all of our dishes well.

I came here about a year ago with my honey and another couple.  At the time, I was vegan - not because I don't love butter and cheese, but because I thought it might help me with some health issues.  The other couple chose the restaurant and made the reservations.  I looked at their menu online and saw that they didn't have any vegan dishes.  Knowing that they were excited about the place and not wanting to be rude, I ate dinner beforehand and was just planning on tagging along.  The owner came over to our table to take our orders.  When he got to me, I said - oh I'm not eating.  He asked why and I told him that I was vegan and had already eaten.  He looked at me, completely seriously not even joking, and said - well then why are you here then?  That turned out to be only the beginning of unbelievable rudeness all night.

Once seated, I felt very claustrophobic, since the table next to us were only a few inches away...there was not a lot of privacy.  Waiters were friendly, but service was a little slow.  While waiting for my food, I noticed that there were only 2 waiters and 1 waiter assistance doing everything at the restaurant... so they do work hard.  I ordered the seafood stew, which was good, came with a big bowl of seafood, little bit of sauce and polenta.  The portions were a good size.

The crowd here is a mix of a few tourists who happen to find it and locals who know a very good thing. While the food is Istrian (a peninsula SE of Venice and Trieste), you will recognize the ingredients and savor them in new and wonderful combinations. Rabbit, chicken, pork, always fresh fish and shellfish (mussels marinara in season), and pastas such as you don't find anywhere else (a savory strudel!). They make their rolls from scratch and serve them warm. The desserts here are wonderful and varied - do save room - fresh sorbets and gelati, a chocolate flan-like creation....Basically anything the chef or your server recommends will be wonderful.

Who would have thought German and Italian worked so well together? Except the Japanese I guess...anyways...the point is it was delicious. It was a perfect setting, really intimate like a New York ground level restaurant. Michael the owner was a very pleasant, attractive  host who I'd imagine gets more than his fair share of giggly girl tables, although he doesn't look like he's getting much sleep.
