The food is good and the servers are friendly too. \n\nI ordered the Sisigsilog, which look to me like ground & shredded chicken. It was a little bit salty, but I liked how it was presented on a hot plate. The lemon went well with the dish and wasn't too overpowering. The meal came with some garlic rice and a fried egg. That garlic rice is the bomb!\n\nI also tried the Shangsilog, which comes with some Lumpia (egg rolls). It's good...wouldn't say it's the best though. I'd recommend this dish if you're indecisive though because the flavors aren't too complex.\n\nSince it's a pretty small place, it's easy to miss it. I think there's a minimum of $15 before being able to use a credit card. I wish the portions were bigger, but the price is inexpensive...so I can't complain.", "author": "Victor L."}

Reasonably priced for an SF spot, but while the food was okay it didn't stand out. The logsilog was good but unremarkable. The lumpia in the shangsilog was disappointing since they were so small and light on filling. I was expecting more of the satisfyingly meaty ones I was used to from my Filipino friend's family gatherings, nearly double the size of the ones I got here. The garlic rice was nice and hearty though. The ube macapuno pie lacked texture and flavor on the other hand, probably would not try dessert here again. \n\nOverall a good spot to get a solid but basic plate of food. Doesn't really qualify for the criteria that I look for in a restaurant though, offering things that I would be unable to replicate at home.", "author": "Edward R."}

The place is tiny, has great prices for being in San Francisco, has a variety of tasty looking food...what more could you want? \n\nThe good stuff:\n\nDaily special (pork belly) - I didn't really know what I wanted but the server mentioned the daily special and it sounded like something I'd enjoy. It was fried pork belly with a side of their rice topped with a fried egg. It was simply great to have a hearty meal after a full day of traveling. It's what I'd imagine true, authentic Filipino food to prepared and served like. \n\nThe pork belly was delicious (along with the sweet sauce they serve with it). My only gripe was that it was a little more fatty than I'd like...and yes, I know pork belly is typically fatty. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed everything.", "author": "Eddie K."}

San Francisco is a foodie heaven and there were so many spots I wanted to try. Thank goodness I walked up on Jones St to this little treasure.\n\nIt's a tiny sliver of a spot but they do have a walk-up window. There's about 12 seats inside but they serve things up quick. A menu full of various silogs and a few other Filipino specials and apps. I went with the Sisigsilog which seems to be pretty common for first timers here. Chicken cooked in a lemony, garlicky, soy sauce, and jalape\u00f1o concoction (could use more heat if you asked me but you can add to it). YUM. All of the silogs come with garlic rice and an egg. And if you're a weirdo like me who doesn't like runny yolks (hush), they'll cook it a bit harder for you.\n\nIt's comforting and finger licking delicious. I also tried the buko pie which I ate so fast I wondered if I actually ordered it. \n\nI had to visit again as my Last Supper in SF and had the sisigsilog again but added on a side of the milk fish. The milk fish was OK to me but still tasty, just small. I do like that they let you add on another protein for only 3.99. On that note, the pricing is such a relief in the sometimes very overpriced SF. Great value for what you get.\n\nBonus?? They're opened til 3am on the weekends.

I was wrong.\n\nI initially planned to get ramen that night, but once I got to the ramen place and saw the line was almost 1/2 a block long, plan B kicked in 'cause ain't nobody got time for that!  Reee-diculous.\n\nI got to Tselogs and the first thing I noticed was that it was really SMALL.  You have your tables to the left and your cooking/prepping space in direct view on the right.  There's about 12 seats in the restaurant so definitely be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors!  I chose to sit on the right, so I could watch the meals being prepared and because I like to have more table space when I'm eating.\n\nThe cashier/busser/server, all-around awesome guy explained the menu to me and he could probably tell I couldn't decide what to get because he quickly followed-up with explaining the \"combo\" where I could pick TWO items.  I settled on the tapsilog & sisigsilog combo.\n\nEach dish is usually paired with garlic fried rice with egg on top & some veggies.  The tapsilog - a sweet braised beef - was very tasty, but the real winner here was the sisigsilog.  It came out sizzling hot on a cast iron skillet with a lemon on top.  I took one bite & wow... Mind blown! The lemon was just the perfect touch.  The server recommended putting the itlog (egg) on top of the chicken, mixing it around the skillet, & then finishing it off with the lemon juice.  Freakin' amazing.  Why have I never had this dish?!?  So crazy.  I think the one thing they could improve on is their garlic fried rice.  It's good, but could be elevated SO much more. \n\nOverall though, the service was quick (it really needs to be in a restaurant this small to turn tables faster).  The server was very friendly and although he was busy, he still engaged me in some small talk which I appreciate.  \n\nI'm a fan Tselogs! I'll be back next time I'm in SF!", "author": "Maria P."}

I prefer the noodle dish instead but can never go wrong with soup either. The first dish I got the first time was the palabok which was so yummy! I love glass noodles in general but their sauce and topping made it a dish I'd order again. The second time I went I got the bihon which had a good broth.\n\nBoth times I went, my friends got the chicken sisig.\nIt had a great aroma with garlic and had a ton of flavor packed in that little skillet. Portion wise you made be surprised so you may want a side dish with it.\n\nCustomer service is also very friendly and attentive.\n\nBeware that it is a small place. It's more of a get it to go spot if you have more than 2 people eating.

I am a Filipino American who grew up with Filipino food and everyone knows that Mom's cooking was always the best and not comparable to others. I was skeptic about the suggestion but it was the closest eatery around. \n\nUpon walking in I saw a window you can order from? Kinda neat if you want it to go  or if there is no room inside. When I arrived the canteen was packed. A small whole in the wall located in the Tenderloin area. Luckily 2 people left and there was space front and center of the chefs.\n\nReading through the menu, I see Tocino which is bacon-pork belly formed in cubes   and marinated in wine, sugar, anatto, and water. Fried and crispy on ends. I haven't ate in a while so yes I'll take that. Typically served with garlic fried rice and a over easy egg. My homies ordered the Chicken Sisig- boiling, grilling chicken, chopped onions, and chili pepppers. It is considered a Filipino delicacy.\n\nWait time was 20mins, plenty of time to see what's for dessert? I have to say when our meals came out, I was uber happy. Just like how I cook it at home, the Tocino it is; but the Sisig was delicious. Flavorful and mouthwatering.\n\nWhat I was bumb'd out about was they ran out of Buko pie!

This one located in the tenderloin, serves only about 15-20 people at a time because just like SF, there's no space at all. Due to the limited space, be ready to wait. Fortunately, the staff does a good job of managing seats so you'll be seated within 15-20 minutes depending on party size. \n\nEats: sisigsilog combo with lechon kawali 10/10 $16\n-the lechon (roasted pork belly) is an off the menu item FYI. When served came with about 8-10 pieces. Each piece was 70% fat to 30% meat but that is exactly what you look for in a serving of lechon. Each bite was succulent and rich in delicious grease. What did somewhat lack was the crunch factor of the skin. It had more of a gelatinous texture to it. \n\n-sisig\nThe sisig differs here than anywhere that I've had it as this is not traditional sisig. Traditional sisig usually consists of pork cheek, pork brains, pork ear and other fun parts of the pig. I guess to make it more appealing to the American public, they opted to use chicken instead. Fortunately the tselogs take on sisig is as delicious and possibly even better than most sisig dishes out there. When served it comes out on a sizzling stone skillet. The aroma that the sisig gives always makes me salivate. Each bite is salty and acidic. The blend of lemon, vinegar and soy sauce are flavors prominent within the sisig. What is somewhat missing in the tselogs version of the sisig is the spice of ginger and Chiles. I do love the tselogs version of the sisig as it gives the restaurant it's own flare to it and it appeals to both sisig lovers and those who have never tried sisig before. \n\nWhat I love about tselogs is the consistency in all their dishes. Whether it's this location or the one in Daly City, the food is consistently delicious from when it first reaches my table to when I knock out in my car from having a food coma. When enjoying any sorts of food, you want to have consistent flavors and here at Tselogs they serve that up and then some.", "author": "James L."}

The place is very tiny. As soon as you step inside you're literally in the heart of everything - the take-out counter, the dining area, the kitchen and just a few steps, the restroom.  One side is a small counter and we were literally facing the kitchen where you see the cooks/staff take food out of the fridge, cook and prepare your meal. I don't remember how many people this side sits... six, maybe eight?  The wooden chairs have no backs and the seats aren't wide so, um, just take caution and take note if dining in. Behind us, well, I couldn't tell if this is another place to sit and eat because the long counter is even smaller but it may fit their tiny plates. No one sat on this side while we were there so I'm not sure. There were bar chairs.\n \nWe were given a menu. The silog choices were simple and served with garlic fried rice and one egg.  Everything looks so yummy! I was also eyeing other specials they have including palabok, arroz caldo and pancit bihon among others. And, yes, this tiny eatery also serves homemade desserts! I can't remember the choices but the halo-halo pie caught my eye. This was my first time here and it took me a while to decide but finally went with tocilog (tocino meat) while hubby ordered his favorite, longsilog (longanisa). The plates the dishes were served on were small and the serving size seemed fit for a child but to my surprise my meal was filling and was just the right serving for me. It was tasty and delicious. The gals working there were nice... they didn't interact much with the patrons except to take your order and serve your food.  Oh well...\n \nThis restaurant is really the definition of a 'hole in the wall'.  Everything may be small but the flavorful meals packs on a big punch.

His recommendation was the spiced beef or the off-menu pork belly. \nI went for the arroz caldo and sisigsilog - both of which were great. The arroz was my favourite - if I'd chosen again I would have ordered a large arroz, added an egg and stuck to that. \nWe ordered an egg pie for dessert - and this is the only reason it doesn't get a 5*. It was tasty, however didn't taste the freshest - the pastry itself was a little stale tasting - I guess it was from yesterday.

So I told my two favorite guys I was with, \"Come with me, let's try this place!\" We luckily found parking in this bustling area about two blocks away on a busy Saturday night. \n\nHere are all the Yesses. Yes, it's a small hole-in-the-wall spot. Yes, it's hard to find parking, though we lucked out (meant to be!). Yes, it's not in the greatest area, in the Tenderloin (though I wasn't in danger or scared, you just have to be alert). But even after all this, I say Yes, yes, YES, absolutely you must GO! Don't think about it, debate it, or doubt it. JUST GO, BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD! \n\nGOOD TO KNOW - There is a To-Go window! So you can call ahead & happily take your order with you. But we chose to dine there because there was no wait. But after a few minutes, there was a line out the door seven people deep!\n\nUpon walking in, if I had to guess, I would say about a dozen people fit in there. Barstool sitting against counters. Fully open kitchen diner-style. CLEAN, FRIENDLY, PERSONABLE, & DOWN-HOME FILIPINO COOKING! Just glancing at the menu made me happy. See pic for menu.\n\nA shout out to PATRICK, our server and MATT, our cook, who took care of us this night. \n\n** IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SIZZLING CHICKEN SISIG HERE! $9.99. This is what my brother ordered & I wanted to steal it because, after all, I am the older sister! He was generous & gave me some bites. :) Admittedly, I have never had sisig in my life & if I did, I just don't remember. (I know, I know, don't judge.) BUT THIS CHICKEN SISIG IS EVERYTHING! Marinated chicken grilled & served sizzling In a pan, with other ingredients on a separate plate for mixing - the garlic fried rice & egg. YOU MUST ORDER THIS. TRUST ME! I'm definitely getting this next time, and even one to-go! The flavors are undeniable the grilled, marinated chicken goodness is still haunting me & luring me back. All this FORKALICIOUS 5-STAR GOODNESS for only $9.99.\n\n** TAPSILOG (beef tapa) $9.99, was my choice, complete w/ garlic rice & fried egg. Very good & I do recommend! I enjoyed every bite of this and I would get this again. Though the chicken sisig is still the better-looking boyfriend. ;) \n\n** TOCILOG, marinated pork, the hubster's choice, was very good. He loved it so much, I looked over & it had already disappeared! Haha! $8.99.\n\nAt this price range for Filipino food in SF, I really don't think it gets better than this. So go, go, and free yourself to enjoy this goodness and fall in love like I did. \n\nI think it's time for another date with Tselogs soon...", "author": "Cristina A."}

After a couple of initial failed attempts around the time when they had just opened, I finally managed to try them for dinner a couple of days ago. \n\nTselogs is a very small place with a row of 10-12 counter seats to your right, so even with a small number of people inside it looks very crowded. Earlier you had to go in and place your to-go orders. This made the place even more full with people hanging around the entrance for their orders. Now they have opened up a small window outside where you can place and pickup to-go orders making the process a lot smoother.\n\nMenu is your standard protein + silog (fried egg and rice). I decided to get the Chicken Sisig Silog ($9.99) to-go. If I remember correctly I could pay by card and the order was ready in 10-12 minutes so pretty smooth.\n\nI got a decent sized container with all correct components, fried egg, garlic rice and chicken sisig. Unfortunately everything was subpar. The fried egg was so overdone that the outer ring was almost burnt. The garlic rice was hard and over steamed. The chicken sisig was overly greasy and was topped with crispy bacon bits. The crispy bacon bits were really hard which made the chicken sisig crunchy. I didn't like this at all.\n\nPrice wise they were a little less when compared to Senor Sisig food truck but the quality of the food was not even close. The only thing that it has got going for itself is that it is open real late on the weekends, which gets me to stop by once in a while.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Ever since I've had Papa Urb's sisig, I've been searching for a Filipino restaurant locally that can make it just as good. Unfortunately, Tselogs didn't live up to that expectation. However, they do provide a nice sizzling sisig-silog skillet!\n\nI came here on a Monday evening before attending my first Yelp event. When I walked in, I was greeted right away by one of the cooks. He gave me the menu and explained the items and the process. You pick one entr\u00e9e and are able to add the \"silog\" portion which is a scoop of garlic rice topped with an egg. Since I was craving sisig, I decided to order the sisig-silog. As I mentioned before, this place is super tiny! There are no \"tables\" here per say. It's set up like a bar where you sit at the counter. It's not an ideal setup for a large group but a nice place to stop by for a quick dinner.\n\nMy food arrived and it was a sight for sore eyes! That skillet was sizzling up a storm! The smell radiated the little room and my mouth started watering. Per other Yelper's suggestions, I mashed the egg into the rice and mixed that into the sisig. My expectations were super high, especially after watching the grand sizzling entrance of my entr\u00e9e. Although it was an eye catcher, the flavors just weren't up to par. It was definitely lacking something, but I couldn't quite figure out just what. I usually like my sisig with green onions, Sriracha sauce, and cream. I don't know if that is the Americanized way of eating it, but that's what I was looking for.  It had a decent flavor to it and the meat was hot and tender but it could have used more seasoning.\n\nThe portion size was just enough to fill you up. No leftovers, but it did the job. The cook checked in on me and refilled my water cup without me having to ask. He gave me a punch card that would allow me to gain a free entr\u00e9e after so many visits. I was full after eating my sisig, but I really wanted to try the Halo Halo pie because I just love Halo Halo.

We were greeted and seated immediately, and served my bf and I two empty cups with a long bottle of water to start. The long table we sat at that watched the cooks reminded me of a ramen bar-it's really cute! \nWe ordered Shanghai Lumpia, Longsilog ( a sweet pork sausage with rice and egg), Sisigsilog (bits of chicken and scallions stir fried together with rice and eggs), and Filipino Spaghetti. \n\nThe shanghai Lumpia was a perfect starters appetizer of simple deep fried eggs rolls filled with meat and vegetables with a side of sweet and sour dipping sauce. I could tell they added a hint of banana ketchup to their sauce. Definitely a must try for people that are new to Filipino food! Very popular Filipino finger food.\n\nThe Longsilog plate consisted of 3 sweet sausages- 2 of them were the regular red ones and the 3rd one was the darker garlic ones because they ran out of the original ones toward the end of the night. The garlic one was much better than the sweet red ones in my opinion, so that was an unexpected liking in the end.\nThe sisigsilog was pretty tasty as well. They served it on a hot skillet with a side of lemon. The cook was nice enough to give my bf the helpful tip to mix his sunny side egg with the Sisig followed by a squeeze of lemon for the best consistency. Great tip! I've never eaten my Sisig that way, and i also never usually eat chicken Sisig (I always did pork, liver, ear, etc the freaky authentic way if I ever did with just lemon on it) but i loved the way it tasted regardless.\n\nNow the best part was their Filipino Spaghetti. Served with spaghetti noodles, marinara, and cheese like most Italian spaghettis, Filipino spaghetti is much sweeter with added ground beef, hot dogs, sugar, and buttery noodles. It may sound strange at first but it is a MUST TRY (It is soo good- my friends that have never eaten Filipino food are always a fan). \n\nOverall, the portion sizes were pretty decent considering you spend $10-15 a plate. The customer service was great - the cook that helped us was a pretty nice guy! He was very attentive and helpful giving us a nice tips here and there to make our stay just as enjoyable as the taste of our food. Our wait time was minimal around 5-10 mins to get our food and they always checked up on us to make sure we were happy!

The \"garlic\" rice was also lacking in garlic.\n\nPlates average between $9 and $12 which isn't bad for the amount of food you get. In addition to silog, they also had a few other noodle options (with and without soup) and a generous list of desserts.\n\nVery small location - not good for big groups. Seating reminded me of sitting at a sushi bar. Located in a sorta sketchy area, esp if you're walking up from Market.\n\nHuge props to the guy who plates the food.

The sisigsilog is very different compared to sisig at home in LA, it's more on the vinegar side.

It's my first time trying Pares and my first time even hearing about it.  It's beef that has a sweet Unami flavor to it, not like tocino where it's just sweet.

I don't remember how many lumpia the dish came with, but I would say around 10. They are bite sized and easy to eat. It comes with a red sauce that initially looks spicy, but is in fact, a bit tangy. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the sisigsilog. It had a heart next to it, so I assume it is somebody's favorite. The overall dish was pretty good, but I felt the chicken to be VERY oily and quite salty. Again, I'm not sure if this is what the dish should be like, but the flavor was a bit too much for me.

And based on the name of the place, I quickly concluded it was a Filipino joint. I peeked into this tiny place and see people eating in there. And not just Filipinos, mind you. But I see also non-Filipinos! I mean, c'mon, Filipino food, as beloved as it is within the Filipino community, hasn't had the same mainstream acceptance as say, Thai & even Vietnamese cuisine. So to see non-Filipinos in there suggested to me that this place was worth checking out, if they are able to draw people who might not have a Pinoy palate.\n\nAs I enter with my companion, I see non-Filipinos wolfing down sisig. Okay, you know that's gotta be good, considering that I myself don't even eat sisig normally.\n\nI ordered the bangsilog (milkfish), some lumpia, and washed it down with a slice of Filipino egg pie.

They get the whole comfort food concept down, first and foremost with the cozy and intimate space inside. It's nothing \"fancy,\" the cooks don't put on a show or do any other corny thing, but there's something so warming about watching your dishes come to life in front of you.  We came in at around 11 and had the place to ourselves, which made the homely experience that much more pleasant.\n\nWe ordered the palabok, chicken sisig silog, and the special lechon.  My favorite was the sisig - who cares if it didn't have peppers?  Flavors were rich, the chicken was equal parts tender and crispy from the sizzling plate, and mixing in the egg on top put it over the top.  I've never had palabok before, and after trying it I'm not sure I could eat an entire order, but I loved the acidity that cut through the dominant shrimp flavor in the sauce.  Lechon is lechon is heaven and a heart attack in the wings.  Plus, the garlic rice that came with the sisig and lechon was top notch and later cleared a path in front of me while walking in Union Square (kidding).\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but don't let that discourage you in any way.  If these dishes are representative of what Tselogs offers on the whole, you're in for a treat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-13", "description": "As a former Bay Area resident I've heard about the famous Tselogs in Daly City and had it on my list of restaurants to try. I regretted that I never got the opportunity to try it before I left. Several months before my most recent visit to SF in March 2016 I read an article about another Tselogs opening up in SF, situating itself in the space formerly occupied by Kare-Ken. The stars aligned this time and I was able to convince the No1DP to eat here for late breakfast.\n\nCONCEPT: Filipino breakfast is collectively referred to in the native tongue as -silog. It consists of a meat, garlic fried rice (sinangag) and egg (itlog). It is most emphatically NOT a healthy breakfast and actually tastes best after a night of drinking. When I'm home for the weekend I can be waken up early by the smell of the garlic fried rice or if I'm asked to cooked the rice or egg for the -silog breakfast.\n\nVENUE: The setting looked exactly the same as Kare-Ken: it's a TINY place somewhere in the Tenderloin. No1DP wouldn't feel too comfortable if I were to walk alone at night for a to-go dinner run. The place could probably seat 10 people max on the counters and twice that if they used the other side but that would be approaching being too crowded to the point of intruding other people's personal space. There's an open kitchen but even then that's tiny. It works when your brand calls for a small menu.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow but this is to be expected on a Saturday morning. Turns out she was also doing double-duty serving out to-go orders.\n\nWhile I was looking the menu I noticed that even being situated in SF the price of a -silog dish was less than $10. I was pleasantly surprised given that I expected SF prices to be high considering location but costs are similar to a -silog plate back in SD cities with a noticeable Filipino population. I'm glad that there are actually cheap yet GOOD options for dinner in the city.\n\n- No1DP got the embutidosilog ($7.99). He got it because a lot of the meats were too heavy for him to eat as the first meal of the day and the description said \"meatloaf\". Turned out that said meat contained pork, which is a meat he typically avoids but he was able to still eat most of his dish. I don't like embutido all that much.\n\n- I had my share of tapsilog, tosilog, longsilog, bangusilog and chicksilog from Filipino restaurants so I had their famous sizzling chicken sisigsilog ($8.99). Normal sisig is made with pork and the chicken variation was created as a healthier alternative. The sisig comes in its own cast-iron pan and is served sizzling. I could hear the chicken still being cooked as it was served. Some pieces of chicken were soft and tender and others that were exposed to the bottom of the pan were crispy. The lemon wedge makes a difference as it takes away from some of that fried aftertaste. Eggs were on the runny side (I usually like them less runny) and the No1DP and I observed that the rice cooled down rather quickly. Garlic fried rice is meant to be consumed hot.\n\nAs they were cooking I observed that the corned beef they use for their cornsilog was from the same company that my family buys when we make corned beef at home. Note that the corned beef is sourced from Australia and comes in a circular can, not the crappy American corned beef that comes in a square can. Though I can cook cornsilog, Filipino restaurants in SD do not serve cornsilog and I would like an option should I feel too lazy to cook.\n\nI'm glad that I was able to cross off another restaurant off my ever-growing list of restaurants to try in the Bay Area. On my next visit I definitely would like to try their variation of one of the traditional -silog dishes.", "author": "Isabella B."}

Limited seating, so coming early. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nSISIGSILOG (9/10)- sizzling sisig servied with garlic steamed rice, fried egg and some cucuber slices.  - It's everything you hoped it would be. Crispy, fatty and meaty all at the same time. Would have liked less salt in this and a little more balance in skin/fat to meat ratio. Other than that, this was ah-maz-zing. \n\nPARESILOG (5/10) - beef cubes infused with whole star anise pieces, served with the same sides as above. The sauce and flavors in the paresilog were tasty, but meat quality need to step up its game. Meat pieces were large, but meat quality needed improvement. Freshness wasn't quite there. Meat was chewy and dry and didn't taste like much without the sauce. \n\nBROTH: 9/10 - clear chicken broth for $1. Tasty, just want a touch more chicken essence in there. Perhaps a cup or two of less water will do the trick. \n\nOverall: \n\nFood: 7/10 -  from the average of the reviews above\n\nService: 5/5, friendly staff, informative on providing advice on the menu, even gave us small samples of meat to try before ordering. A homeless lady walked in and the servers diplomatically took care of her and ensuring the patrons were not interrupted. \n\nAtmosphere: 4/5 Cozy seating, open kitchen (I love watching food being cooked), ventilation system just needs to be turned up a notch as we left smelling like sizzling sisig from hair to shoes. \n\nEat here.", "author": "Janice K."}

We got Sisiglsilog (Chicken Silog), Arroz Caldo Pares (Porridge w/ Beef), Palabok (Noodles) aannnnnd Lumpia!  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Sisigsilog, which was a good size portion with chicken, garlic rice cucumbers and tomatoes.  It was consumed really fast.  Nothing was left.  The porridge I ordered was piping hot and it was eaten slowly.  To make up the discrepancy between my order and his, we ordered Lumpia.  But I blinked and the Lumpia was gone.  I saved the Palabok for lunch tomorrow.  Really most of the food was so good.  Five Stars.  \n\nOverall, I knocked off a star partially because this place is TINY!  Like really this is place is literally a hole in the wall.  It doesn't kill the ambiance though because the employees are charming and attentive and there's a nice vibe.  Although, I did get seated right next to the speakers, which I wasn't in love with, but I just \"lucked out\" in getting the one seat I'd dislike.  \n\nI think I mostly knocked off a star because I wasn't in love with the Palabok, but all restaurants make their Palabok differently. Usually despite this, Palabok remains my favorite Filipino food, but I wasn't feeling the same happiness I usually feel when eating Palabok from this place. But everything else was so good, so my opinion remains unchanged that the food is still five stars!  \n\nMy recommendation would be, don't get the Palabok, get everything else.  Also!  We found out after we ordered, but supposedly, you can combine the silog options for the types of meat (like half and half I assume).

The chicken came in a sizzling plate and on the side they had garlic rice, a lemon slice, and an egg fried sunny side up. (I tossed the egg into the sizzling plate to cook it more because I prefer my eggs over hard.) \n\nI would recommend you taste the chicken before adding juice from the lemon slice onto the chicken because the chicken is already seasoned with vinegar. So when I straight up added the lemon juice without tasting, my plate ended up tasting too sour. The chicken, egg, and garlic rice come together beautifully. The only drawback was that the chicken was extremely oily.\n\nThe lumpia (like an eggroll) was also delicious. They serve 12 pieces when you order the appetizer so I'd recommend you get it to share if you plan on ordering lumpia.

I am upset I haven't introduced this to my taste buds to this till this year but alas, I'll be back to the Tenderloin just for Tselogs!\n\nWe tried... \n- The Sisig ($10): I have nothing to compare this to but as my first time trying this dish, I found myself reaching for it throughout the night. This dish comes with garlic rice and an egg, with a side of chicken in a tiny pan. The chicken is shredded in form and coated in seasoning and some sort of creaminess to it. Spritzing lemon onto the chicken also makes you reach for the dish more as it can get a little too flavorful. \n- The Pork Belly Special ($12): This dish is one of my all time favorites among food in SF! I am a huge fan of pork belly and I let myself indulge when I ordered the special. Sitting at the long table facing the bumpin' chefs, I saw them deep fry these suckers and pull them out steaming hot to cut an entire strip per plate. The portions are large and the chunks of pork are huge as well! I honestly was in love with the crispy outside and the tender meat inside! I usually also try to avoid eating pure fat but was unable to escape the appeal of the pork belly here. It's incredible and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. \n\nFYI - \n- Seating is limited here with around 12-15ish seats across 2 long tables\n- Ask what the special is! I did, tried it, and was in love with the fried pork belly\n- The carry out counter is essentially a window at the front of the store and is great!

You can even mix everything together and add some banana ketchup. By the way, the banana ketchup is worth a try! It's ketchup made completely with banana instead of tomato. The only thing I would love is if the rice were a little bit more cooked through with a stronger garlic taste, and the meat included some more veggies.\n\nI've also had the bihon (rice vermicelli noodles with meat/veggies) and lumpia. Both were good choices as well. \n\nMost dishes are around $8.99. The portions are perfect for a meal, but not large enough for leftovers. Service is pretty quick, and they accept credit cards.

It's clean and cozy, and I can sit at the counter reading, watching the cooks, and listening to the light chatter in Tagalog among patrons and servers and owners. Friendly people of all colors flow in for elegant, homey meals on the cheap, eating in or taking out. It's got the best kind of neighborhood vibe -- though I live in the Mission, I come over here and feel the love and comfort food lift up the neighborhood. And that's not always easy to do in the Tenderloin. \n\nIf you're new to Filipino \"silog,\" a silog is a meal that includes a protein, garlic rice, and a gooey, fried egg. Tselogs serves several different kinds, from fish to chicken to sausage, prepared with Filipino flavors. Sisig-style (chopped up pork or other meat cooked on a very hot cast-iron pan) is the most popular and most loved (ask Anthony Bourdain).\n\nThis place is a tiny shotgun-style diner with updated blond wood trim, tucked away in a dive-y area north of Market, though the restaurant inside doesn't feel dive-y at all. Sitting inside, I feel like I'm in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, or tucked away somewhere in a Manila enclave, or in some quiet tiny gem in a big Asian city. \n\nToday the special was chicken adobosilog, but I always get my favorite, the chicken sisigsilog, because I love sisig, and the fact that it's chicken makes it feel a little healthier than the original pork version. You'll still feel heavier after eating it though, but the garlic rice mixed with the yolk-y egg, and the crispy bits of chicken from the bottom of the sizzling single-serve cast-iron pan -- worth it. When you get the sisig, wait a few minutes so that the pan can create the crispy charred bits of chicken on the bottom, then mix it around, drop your egg on top of your perfect garlic rice dome, smoosh it down, and then scoop the chicken bits on top. (Alternately, you can drop the egg on top of the sisig/protein and then mix that with the rice.) It's as satisfying as the crispy rice bits at the bottom of the stone bowl in dolsot bibimbap.\n\nI just wish they had Turon for dessert! That and mango shakes. This is friendly, affordable Filipino comfort food at its best.", "author": "Robin L."}

First, the owners and chefs clearly have a system that enables to produce the same quality and expectations for each of their menu items. Their menu is limited so they can try and do the best for each dish. The presentation is excellent and all the components match and complement but also show Filipino inspiration and tradition (garlic rice and egg!). Just a little critique: the lechon kawali can have crispier skin but the meat was not overcooked and was still very tender and moist. The lumpia shanghai needed a little more kick such as perhaps shrimp or salt and the wrapper wasn't as crunchy as it could be but again I could see how careful they were not to overcook it so clearly care is given. I wasn't too keen on the chicken sisig since I'm more used to pork sisig and it had an almost adobo taste to it. However I noticed many of the Indian patrons loved the chicken sisig so I get it. The buko pie needed more sugar as some people don't eat it with ice cream. Overall a very pleasant experience.", "author": "Mr W."}

He took the time to answer our questions and when he didn't know himself, he asked the chef. He was forth coming with the suggestions and let us try somethings before we made up our minds. Heck even after we ordered he brought some stuff out to say hey try this. We didn't look special but he made me feel like I was. You get garlic fried rice and a fried egg sunny side up. The flavours are there. It's no Michelin star, you get what you paid for and then some. I thought it was value for money. I had Carl's Jnr for about 9 bucks and would have loved tobhave gone here instead if they were open at 2am but it is what it is.", "author": "Franky M."}

As other people have previously mentioned, it's a hole in the wall -- and that's pretty cool. Makes you feel super cool when you stumble upon it. I guess you can call it a hidden gem in the Tenderloin. The only seating they have there are the seats that line up along the counter, and another row of seats that run parallel but face the wall.\n\nOne star off because the workers weren't that friendly. Maybe they were having an off day, who knows. My friend complained that they kept staring at her, which made her feel very uncomfortable. \n\nAnother star off because of the food. Some of my favorite Filipino foods are tocino and lumpia. So naturally, I ordered the tocilog and a plate of lumpia to share with my friends. The meat for the tocino was sweet (as it should be), but lacked flavor. The meat was also a little too tough, so that was weird to me. The lumpia tasted alright, but I've had better lumpia from other places. \n\nMy friend thought his longsilog tasted decent. I didn't try his plate. On the other hand, I tried my other friend's plate. She got the chicken sisigsilog. She thought it was a little too salty for, but I disagree. I thought it was a perfect balance of flavor and saltiness. I also was amazed at how it was served on a sizzling plate- I haven't seen that before. Therefore, if you do plan on coming here, I recommend the chicken sisigsilog!", "author": "Rachel M."}

The original had the most creamiest, delicious sizzling sisig!! I've also tried the temporary location which is at a bar, and that place made the sisig with too much onion and was not even served on a sizzling platter, which is kind of the point of ordering sizzling sisig. I thought all locations would be the same as the original, but they aren't. Not too sure if I'd even spend the time and money at the newest location at Colma because of expected disappointment after trying out these other locations. Has the management  or ingredients changed? Regardless, it's just become more of a disappointment.

The professional thing to have done was immediately ask if I wanted a new plate rather than blaming me for being sat next to the door. \n\nTip: if there's any bugs on a customers food, don't blame them.

You guys have to stop by and check it out. The only thing I would say about this place is that it needs more chairs lol. Kinda tight space but the food is so worth the wait!", "author": "Margarita V."}

So excited to try Filipino eatery anywhere!\nOrdered lunpia Shanghai,tocilog, tapsilog, lechon kawali, and arroz caldo. Each item is an insult to classic favorite Filipino cuisines. If only we weren't hungry I would asked my family to get up and leave. Still pay for the food but leave it barely eaten. You call it tocino? Grounded??!!Tapa? Cut in cubes???!! Lechon kawali? Bland and greasy? Arroz caldo supposedly ... But got a chicken... Okay okay this one even though it's not fresh and was pre-cooked it was tasty with a dose of msg. Even lets say other items had msg it's an insult to the purpose of adding msg. The Shanghai tasted so bad a like rotten pork we all had tummy ache afterward. \nAnd what's with the gloves??? What is the purpose of wearing the gloves when you are touching EVERYTHING. REALLY EVERYTHING???? \nI guess diners have no choice when they want some Filipino foods when they can't either cook or or don't have time to cook. It seems everything in this eatery are pre-cooked nothing fresh. Also using the rags to clean up for  EVERYTHING.... EVERYTHING ???!!!\nOkay... I will be nice and say Staffs were nice though. But I came to eat good quality food which is lacking not for the staff.", "author": "E S."}

So much tselog options, LOVE it.\n\nMy BF ordered the hot dogsilog, and he liked it.\n\nI ordered the combo chicken sisigsilog plus cornbisilog, it was good but the sauce caught me a little off guard. I can't quite put my finger ok it, but it had a strange after taste for me. Cornbisilog was yummy. Garlic rice was on POINT. \n\nBoth our eggs were slightly overcooked.\n\nWhat was noteworthy was the palabok. So delicious. Sauce was good. They use the very thin palabok noodles. Glad we ordered this to try, cause it was probably our favorite order.", "author": "Melissa O."}
