We got the geoduck, salted cod and the three main entrees: pork belly, duck confit, and sable fish with mussels.\n\nIt's not like the dishes were bad: they were good, but not great. The flavors all belonged together and it was certainly a gastronomic experience but I felt like my excitement for every dish was diminished when I saw how saw the portions were... They were really really small. Also, the pork belly and duck confit wasn't as soft and  tender as I would've liked it. And the portions were so small that I couldn't even get an opinion on the other plates. Thank God for the chips (we even had to get a second bowl because we were still hungry). \n\nI would say the redeeming factor would be the desserts at the end, the brunt honey ice cream and the corn ice cream with blueberries. We eavesdropped and heard that apparently, Commonwealth has its own beehive?!\n\nAll in all, the nice word would be good, the not-so-nice word would be bland, especially for a $200 meal (including tip).

The waiter was patient enough to entertain our questions and bring out the bottle for photos... we also got a few extra glasses ;) They're very generous with their pours overall, so make sure you plan accordingly (bring a heavyweight / DD / uber, please!)\n\nI always feel like it's a little bit of a spoiler to read about the food at fine dining restaurants. You're going in for an experience, for your taste buds, you feel? That being said, I will say that their horseradish cream was life-changing-ly good.

This was my second time to Commonwealth, but it had been over a year and I was excited to go back (my original feeling was: very solid, maybe a little over worked with foams, gels, etc). TLDR: this is still my impression. \n\nYou have two options prefixe or a la carte. It was a bit of a tough decision since of course there were a couple dishes on the prefixe and a la carte I wanted. The waiter was very sweet and said any of the a la carte options can also be tacked onto the pre fixe menu. However, when push came to shove my love of sharing and trying all things prevailed and we went with the a la carte menu. Why get duplicates of 5 things when you can order 10 unique items?! No brainer. \n\nAnyway, had a lovely meal, service was stellar and I just love the space and ambiance in general. I'm not going to go majorly into the food as 1) this review is a little over due so my memory is slightly failing me, and 2) the menu rotates so frequently I am not sure it would do any good. \n\nOverall my feelings with Commonwealth are that they produce some beautiful plates. Flavor wise, we definitely tended toward the simpler, cleaner dishes, but that being said absolutely nothing was bad. \n\nGreat wine list (of course we got the Kermit Gamay which I somehow managed to have 3 times during my birthday week). \n\nDefinitely worth a stop, I'm just not sure it is worth two.", "author": "Adele T."}

I was told that they do seatings for large groups at 5:30 and 8:30 so I took the later time slot. Our group all showed up early and we weren't seated until past 9pm, which wasn't great but it's such a small restaurant, it's understandable. \n\nWe had the 4 course tasting menu and ordered two bottles of wine. We started with two amuse bouche courses, one was a fish and the other a vegetable. The fish was super salty, which I'm super sensitive to. The salt overwhelmed the fish and I couldn't taste the natural sweetness of the fish at all. I asked the waiter to ask the chef to go less on the salt. \n\nThe first course was a lightly torched/smoked trout and I also found it really salty. Once again, when the fish is so salty, it's very one note. I did like the textural differences between the fish and the other elements of the fish. \n\nThe second course was a peach salad. That was probably my favorite course of the night. It wasn't overly salted and the blend of the sweet of the peaches and the pepperiness of the salad mix really hit the spot. \n\nThe main course was soud vide beef with a bowl of rice and mushrooms on the side. The cut of beef wasn't great because there were some parts that were super sinewy and hard to chew. The meat wasn't properly butchered or something. The accompaniments of the dish were good but couldn't make up for the chewiness of the protein. \n\nThe dessert was an ice cream with meringue and chocolate and crispy rice bark of some sort. It was a bit overly sweet but otherwise very good. Our waiter also brought out some caramels and fruit jellies at the end of the meal. \n\nAll in all, I wasn't impressed. Our tables weren't even. The food and the ambiance just isn't what I would expect from a top restaurant even though they have some interesting flavor combinations.", "author": "Alice W."}

They had the wrong phone number and the wrong date written down. We became a tad bit stressed thinking we wouldn't be able to have the birthday dinner we planned, but they pulled some strings and were able to seat us at the time we planned, with the extended tasting menu. \n\nQuick tip: If you're going for the prix fixe, GO FOR THE EXTENDED! If you have the time and don't mind dishing up a couple extra 10's, definitely do the extended. Regular is 7 course to extended being 13 courses, I believe. If you want the extended, you have to ask during the reservation making stage. You can't request it upon seating.\n\nOnce we were seated, everything was smooth sailing. They brought out their amazing seaweed salted potato chips and two glasses of bubblies (couldn't tell if this was for the mixup, the birthday, or what). Each course of the extended tasting was so delicious, but some of our favorites were: barley & pork belly and the wagyu beef with japanese-styled mushroom porridge/risotto. Obviously we're big carnivores. Their dessert was fabulous too - burnt honey ice cream with meringue, home-made dark chocolate, and seared marshmallow cream. \n\nThe extended tasting is technically 13 courses, but ends up being about 16-17 with all the amuse-bouche, in-betweens and palate cleansers. They called it a 'culinary experience,' and it certainly feels cheap calling it anything but that. It was a great, 3 hour experience :) \n\nBonus is that there is a parking lot attached, downside is Commonwealth charges $5 (but that's chump change compared to the $10/15 minutes lots in SF!)", "author": "Christine Y."}

Luckily, they have their own parking lot, which is nice, that accommodates 8-10 cars. The restaurant isn't as big as I thought it would be but it also isn't tiny. Ambiance is cozy and intimate and the decorations are very cute. I didn't, however, like how the tables were so close to each other. I could literally hear the conversation of the couple next to us and when our server was taking their orders/plates, her butt was all over our table. Not cool. Speaking of our server though, she was friendly and nice and the service she provided was good. No complaints. \n\nFood-wise, my boyfriend and I opted for their a la carte menu for $85 per person. I, initially, wanted to try the sea urchin but they didn't have any more left. =( So I ended up getting the scallop instead, then potato dumplings and young hen while my bf had the scallop as well, black trumpet mushrooms and monkfish. The entrees were okay in my opinion. Good and refreshing but nothing really stood out to me. I did like the seaweed potato chips and its dip though and also the amuse-bouche. Ahh, the wasabi in it was pretty good. For dessert, we shared an order of the burnt honey ice cream and OMG, that one took the cake.

At first glance, it's easy to miss the entrance because it is tucked on the side by the parking lot. The moment you come in, you'll see a well decorated and cozy restaurant with dim lights. One thing I didn't like as much is that the tables were so close to each other. So close that I can clearly hear what the people next to us were talking about.\n\nTheir menu consists of tasting menu and a la carte menu, both decently priced. We both decided to go with the a la carte menu. They first handed us a seaweed potato chips while we wait for our food and an amuse-bouche right after (I totally forgot what it was but it was refreshing). My girlfriend had the scallops, potato dumplings, and young hen. As for me, I had the scallops as well, black trumpet mushrooms, and monkfish. The food was really good but nothing memorable or that stood out, EXCEPT FOR THE DESSERT! The burnt honey ice cream. It is one of the best desserts I've ever had.

Their sign is in the direction of the parking lot as well as their entrance. The place itself is fairly small and reservations are highly recommended. Making reservation was super easy on opentable and they called me a few days before to confirm it. You can either order their tasting menu or a la carte. I got their tasting menu and when the first couple of dishes came out I was pretty worried that it wasn't going to be enough food. Each plate was fairly small, but was very unique in their own flavors. I wished the portion was just a bit bigger so I could've enjoyed it longer. Surprisingly it was just enough food for me to feel comfortable and not overly stuffed. One of the most unique dish for me was probably the celery sorbet. It was super refreshing and the verjus soda gave it a nice tangy kick. \n\nWhat I don't like is the tables are really close to each other and you can hear the other tables conversation. The party next to us made some snide comments when we were talking pictures of each dishes and it kind of ruined the vibe. The pace of when each dish came out wasn't consistent either, but it did help the food settle in and it may be why it was just enough food for me. \n\nI do recommend coming here at least once.

Do not make the naive error of coming here hungry - these are really small portions with an emphasis on style and californication. \n\nYou have the optionality to choose either a tasting menu or a'la carte. Tasting menu has pescatarian or vegetarian options as well. Tasting alone is $85 and with wine pairing $140. We both teetotaled. \n\nI opted for pescatarian menu, my companion opted for regular tasting menu.\n\nI ordered roasted carrots off the a la carte menu as a \"starter\" and then during the meal to replace a dish I didn't favor.

The tasting menu is $85 for six courses without wine pairing and $140 includes wine pairing. As for the courses, the portion is on the smaller side.

Servers were very knowledgeable about the menu and what dishes were shareable and not.  The sommalier made a great recommendation when we described our tastes in white wine.  Didn't feel rushed during service and we didn't wait for dishes too long; the only time we were rushed was at the very end, when we were asked to go to the bar after our meal since they had another reservation waiting to be seated (haven't had this happen in a while). \n\nFood: they offer a la carte or tasting menu (in which the entire table must participate in); our group decided to go for the a la carte since there were certain dishes we wanted to try.  They usually recommend three dishes, as portion sizes are small.  The menu is divided by hot appetizers, cold appetizers, and \"entrees\" but you can choose any combo (one person in my group did 2 cold apps and an entree).  Note that it is a bit difficult to share dishes since the portions are that small; it probably would only work for two people.\n  \n-- Charred stonefruit, buttermilk sorbet, celtuce, avocado, sake lees, togarashi, mizuna ($15)- a really great, light start to the meal.  The buttermilk sorbet is one of my favorites; it almost tastes like a thicker version of a plain froyo.  Not sure of the other components on the dish; it made it seem a bit busy and kinda hard to get the perfect bite, but it was still tasty once you managed to get everything on your fork.  \n\n-- Chanterelle mushroom, white miso custard, ramps, peas, nori paper, fermented fiddleheads, brown butter ($19) - this hot appetizer was one that was deemed shareable by the waiter but I ordered this on my own.  Mushrooms were cooked well and had a great earthy flavor, complemented by the brown butter.  Thankfully the custard wasn't too heavy.  I was worried that the ramps, peas, fiddleheads and nori would make the dish seem busy, but they all added a nice refreshing quality to the dish.  Highly recommend.\n\n-- Young hen, sunflower seed porridge, haricots verts, lemon jam, charred onion, basil ($21) - yay chicken cooked well and still being juicy!  Skin was nice and crispy too so it added a good crunch to the bite.  The seed porridge had an interesting chewy texture to it (vs regular mushy porridge) and surprisingly had a little kick to it.  \n\n-- Salted date ice cream, pumpkin seed croquant, black sesame caramel (not sure of price) - recommended by the waiter and one of the highlights of our meal.  Tasted almost like a salted caramel ice cream, except lighter in flavor and feeling in your stomach.  My favorite part was the black sesame caramel, which complemented the salt and sweet date ice cream with a tad of bitterness that I love black sesame for.  Highly recommend!!\n\nAll together, the food and bottle of white wine came out to slightly less than $100 per person.  \n\nReally enjoyed the meal, which was well composed (maybe a bit too tweezer-fied for my liking but not ridiculously so).

After spending 113 per person including 3 entr\u00e9es each plus splitting a bottle of wine among 4 people, I was still hungry. \n\nI hate to be so plebeian about this. I realize quantity is not as important as quality. However occasionally I get the impression that quantity is being reduced specifically for the purpose of creating a scarcity / value association. \"This food is so incredibly high quality and rare,\" they seem to be implying, \"That we are only giving you three bites per plate.\" And that is literally about what you get. I can almost hear the owner thinking, \"Starred restaurants often have small portions. We should do that.\"\n\nTheir main courses are about $20 each, and they immediately recommend at least 3 per person. But after that, if you had any kind of appetite to begin with it will not be satisfied at the conclusion of the meal.\n\nIs the food good? Is it tasty? Without a doubt! The flavors and creative combinations are sublime. The ingredients are wonderful. If not, this would not have even rated 4*. The quality saves it from the annoyance I felt at the incredibly small portions and high prices.\n\nIf there's one area where they shine the most, it's presentation. The presentation is perfect. It's creative, elegant, and artistic. Each dish is inspiring and inspired.\n\nThe wines are undoubtedly excellent here as well, though we didn't find one we were crazy about. Their som (or resident non-som wine person, not sure) was friendly and helpful, but ultimately we just didn't find something that matched our taste exactly so we just accepted the recommendation. Unfortunately you cannot try wine in bottles that are not open, so you make your best guess and live with the results. For us it wasn't what we wanted actually, but we felt subtly pressured to accept it.\n\nThe lighting is low. It makes for an aesthetically pleasing and rich experience, but it's almost a bit TOO low. No one in my group of four could read the menus and we were holding the table candles up close, squinting, and struggling. This may not be obvious from the photos I posted... but that's because I had to edit the balance on the photos and lighten them up considerably so the food / restaurant would be visible at all.\n\nThe noticeably small portions and noticeably low light make me feel like this place tries a bit too hard to be taken seriously.

I know beef belly is fatty, but we ended up leaving large chunks of just fat sitting on our plate.\n\nPalate cleanser: Celery Sorbet\nDelightfully light and refreshing, no complaints about this one\n\nFinal dessert: a date ice cream covered in fudge and different crunchy nut type elements\nThis was delicious on its own and I appreciate the different textures of the dish, but I wish the desserts weren't just sorbet followed by ice cream, especially since SF is on the colder side right now. Sorbet and ice cream fall kind of in a similar food family to me, so it would have been nice if it were paired with a slightly different dessert/element.\n\nAs a last little goodbye, they sent out this jelly gummy thing and a crunchy chewy bar.  The jelly thing was awesome, but we really didn't like the crunchy chewy bar.  It was really sticky and got stuck to our teeth. Though a bit extreme, my husband said he hated it and didn't even finish it.  It's a shame because overall, the meal was delicious, and that last little bit left us on a bad note. \n\nOverall, I actually thought the portion sizes were perfect and the food was spectacular.

What I love about the tasting menu is that you can choose either a meat or pescatarian option right off the menu, or request for a full vegetarian option. \n\nService: 5/5.

Looked at it retrospectively (based on the a la carte dishes), I felt nothing but regretful. \n\nDish 1 - shaved zucchini with puffed grains. This was probably the prettiest zucchini I have ever seen in my life - like three flowers sitting quietly in front of me. The grain flavor combined itself perfectly well with the freshness of zucchini slices. Marvelous!\n\nDish 2 - young hen. Lightly roasted yet perfectly seasoned, not dry at all compared with many of the other chicken breasts I have tried elsewhere. The skin was not crispy as I imagined, yet I did enjoyed the somewhat chewy texture.\n\nDish 3 - strawberry ice cream. Another impressive art on the night. The frozen strawberry balanced well with the sweetness of white chocolate. \n\nI also enjoyed my small bite at the beginning (clam) and in the end (matcha marshmallow).

The ambiance was very relaxing which was complimented by the well mannered and educated staff.\n\nWe each had the tasting menu which was nothing short of amazing. My father who is not into any pretentious scene in the least felt comfortable with the food that was unfamiliar to him, and despite the smaller portions he is unaccustomed to; he kept commenting on how satisfied and full he was well after we left.\n\nIn simplest of terms, we walked away with the appreciation that we had chosen Commonwealth for dinner that evening and that we were in agreeance that we would; one return and two recommend to friends.\n\nI personally will be back to try out some of the a la carte dishes. \nChef Jason Fox's tasting menu was beyond words; especially for the reasonable price point given it has a Michelin Star and the evident quality of fresh ingredients. I look forward in seeing what up the upcoming seasons brings to the menu. \n\nEverything tasted amazing from start to finish.

Kitchen is open, and music is tastefully matched to the decor and mood of the room.\n\nFood...oh the food...while ingredient quality is high, and execution is generally on-point, it's as if the chefs lack courage.

Went for the tasting menu and not the standalone dishes. squid noodles, spring peas, chicken skin, radish, finger lime, mint and pea consomme was so beautiful. Not much flavor, but so visually beautiful. The crispy oysters, creamed nettles, sorrel, coastal succulents, frozen horseradish mousse was absolutely delicious AFTER removing the creamed nettles that actually took away than added to the dish. After it was removed, the dish was so light, flavorful and delicious. The artichokes, burnt lemon, brioche, black truffle, shaved parmesan, wild greens was surprising in that it was cold and not warm. Another beautiful dish, but confusing. The lamb cheeks, spring alliums, purple barley, barbecued date butter, wild fennel, green garlic jus was beautiful and delicious minus the date butter which made the dish distastefully sweet. The celery sorbet was ambitious in al the wrong ways, and raised the question of whether anyone in the kitchen tasted it before it was served. The worst part of the entire meal. The burnt honey ice cream, matcha meringue, chocolate tuile was prepared for my friend and I went with a cheese dessert offering that was perhaps a bit strong or pungent for some but great for me.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

The amberjack dish was a bit unique in that it included black sesame and some type of gelatin for texture contrast, as well as micro-herbs from their rooftop garden (obviously). The morels were tasty, probably the most savory mushrooms I've had besides truffles. The gem lettuce was probably my favorite appetizer.\n\nOur mains were the sablefish, pork belly, and hen. The sablefish was poached perfectly and served in a creamy sauce, along with squid ink crackers. The pork belly was cooked well also, though it came in a \"blood pudding\" sauce whose color was a little off putting. The hen was my favorite dish.

Loved the variety in the courses and the food was so well presented and prepared. I got the tasting menu with the wine pairing and wouldn't have done it any other way. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Chips with vinegar mousse dip on the house - a perfect snack! Although it made me feel sad that I only ate a few...\n2. Calamari with activated charcoal aioli - I am not usually one for aioli (I hate mayo), but this was soooo tasty, and totally blew my expectations out of the water for any food with charcoal in it.\n3. Egg tofu and clams - Refreshing and tasty. And paired with the best sake I've ever had.\n4. Smoked trout - The smell of this alone was enough to make me happy. The smoky flavor hit my nostrils before the dish was on the table.\n5. Chicken liver mousse tart - Incredibly rich with a hint of fruitiness from the grape gelee. So interesting that it was paired with a dessert wine. \n6. Hazelnut milk custard with kohlrabi - This one was super unusual, with the milk custard and the ginger making it a salad unlike any I've ever had before. The mixture of textures was a little odd, but flavor is great.\n7. Braised beef belly - Rich and tender, complemented perfectly by the potato pave and horseradish cream. This course felt a little too rich for the tasting menu (I could have actually done with a smaller meat course at this point, especially after that super lush chicken liver mousse tart).\n8. Celery sorbet - A million times better than you'd imagine.\n9. Salted date ice cream - A decadent way to end the meal. The black sesame was a brilliant addition.\n\nSmall additional note to say that the service was also fantastic. They took time to tell us stories about each wine pairing and course (in addition to just saying what it was). \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Commonwealth (esp. the tasting menu).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-27", "description": "Commonwealth was a one time visit from me... Visiting SF for the first time and of course had to try at least 1 Michelin rated restaurant during my visit here. I was able to book a reservation for a party of 4 a week ago so decided to come here (might have been an indication that it's not that great when you can make a reservation 1 week ahead... should normally be packed). \n\nThe entrance to Commonwealth is kind of hard to find/the restaurant does not have a very visible sign (or no sign at all from what I remember). They do have a small parking lot in front (like 6 car parking lot), or you would have to find street parking. My friend and I came 30 min earlier than the rest of our party so we sat at the bar to take a look at the drink menu. Commonwealth does not have a liquor license so its only wine/spirits. They had one \"cocktail\" that sounded pretty interesting that was made with sake and liquid nitrogen but we refrained from ordering anything until our party arrived.\n\nWe got promptly seated when the rest of our party came. The one thing I did not really appreciate at this restaurant was that the manager (did not catch her name but you can definitely tell shes in charge), was very curt throughout the whole time I was there. Whether it was to ask her a question about what my current course was, or just a general favor she had on a very unwelcoming demeanor and had the look of \"why don't you know this.\" The rest of the waiters were also not that friendly but definitely nicer than the manager.\n\nWe opted to try the tasting menu because for the A La Carte Menu the waiter recommended that you order 3 dishes because they are on the smaller side. Most of the items on the A La Carte side are $20ish... That means just ordering 3 small dishes will be $60+tip/tax. Might as well get the 7 course tasting menu for $85+tip/tax. ALSO, I know this was a tasting menu so of course the dishes are small but everything here was extra small in my opinion... So eat beforehand if you're trying the tasting menu. They were accommodating in terms of being able to switch one of the courses out for my friend. She really dislikes scallops and loves uni so she was able to switch out her 2nd course with the Sea Urchin A La Carte Dish. We started off with some sort of octopus dish (complimentary) that was tasty but I can't remember what it was made out of. After this dish our meal proceeded as follows (I'm sure the tasting menu is seasonal so this was the menu in September 2017): Crispy Okra, Scallops, Cherry Tomatoes, Charred Stonefruit Salad, Duck, Celery Sorbet, and Salted Date Ice-Cream. Out of everything on the tasting menu I enjoyed the Crispy Okra and Duck the best. Almost all of the dishes here tasted \"interesting.\" Everything was served with unusual flavors/toppings/sauces. Things you would never expect to eat together. Celery Sorbet?? ANDDDDD Commonwealth does not server liquor. Just spirits/sake/wine. FYI for the people who wanted to enjoy a cocktail at this restaurant. You can't.\n\nOverall, one of my least enjoyed Michelin restaurants. The price you pay for what you get is just not worth it and there was not one item that I loved that I would go back and re-order. The service as I mentioned before also added to the subpar experience. Spend your money elsewhere.", "author": "Yoona K."}

We went fir my birthday and dropped 500 dollars for dinner on the tasting menu and their most expensive wine. That was close to a week take home fir my partner who teaches. We were then told the table was needed. Weird: we wanted to do the extended tasting menu - which would have taken longer - but they wouldn't do pescaterean. We complained and gave them s chance to make amends but they doubled down - they claimed they offered us a drink at the bar / which I never heard nor did my partner.\n\nIt's too bad because the rest of the servers were relatively good. I say relatively because they didn't immediately know the source for their octopus. It matters fir many reasons including health since the larger ones are very high in mercury snd , for others, because importing them leaves a big carbon footprint. Also, the server who booted us out, didn't push us to the 150 wine but also suggested two others at 60ish that we also might have liked, he thought, given our flavor profile.\n\nThe food itself is generally very fresh and very imaginative. I especially liked the sea urchin, which is hard to get. It's very modernist and generally very clean - the chips instead of bread obviously not so much. Portions are small so if you isn't buy part of the Facebook or amazon iPo then you'd think this is pretty pricey. \n\nThe dining room is clean and a nice blank slate for the food. The tables are also generally well spaced compared to tighter places like Frances and SPQR\n\nThe acoustics are also decent but probably sub par if you have trouble with ambient noise.\n\nIt's a nice touch that they have a parking lot reasonably priced. \n\nAll in all, if you want modernist good but better service, then you'd be better off at contrada, with Denise formerly of SPQR, or Contigo in noe valley, or Cala in Civic Center, or Foreign Cinema nearby. This seems like another of the long list of once good snd service driven restaurants that have tumbled: SPQR with total kitchen and staff turnover, Mourad with its once charming Azizza still shuttered, and Aster that noe died only tasting menus and also lost its best servers.\n\nTo be fair, when I give a bad review, I always check with the restaurant.

I went to Commonwealth 2 weeks ago and after visiting a few other restaurants I decided I should really share my experience so perhaps some of you will decide not to give this restaurant a chance because they don't deserve it at all.\n\nI was quite excited about my visit since the reviews on yelp seems quite well except a small percentage of terrible reviews.Well I should have read them before I visited! Commonwealth is a ONE STAR MICHELIN restaurant. What does it mean?It means the food aren't cheap, but you can expect a fine dining experience with quality food, great service, and nice ambience. \n\nNow what's wrong with my experience?  (food) \n\nMy friend and I ordered the 6 courses tasting menu ($85), and my friend got a glass of very watery pink soda (forgot what it's called) and I had a glass of wine. After tax and tip our bill was around $260. We don't believe the price is justifiable based on the food and the service.\n\nI would't say every courses we had was bad. That'd just be totally biased. I did like our 2nd course which was a sheet of scallop. The presentation for most of the dishes were small but I appreciated the fact that the 3rd course was a small bowl porridge with three small cubes of shrimp so we didn't have to go home feeling hungry!!! \n\nThe 4th course is cilantro sorbet with a few pieces of charred stoned pear. I'm not a big fan of cilantro sorbet and I didn't think they really went well together. \n\nThe 5th course is duck meat. It's the most disappointing course because not only it's overdone and not seasoning correctly so it has a strange smell that I don't even know how to describe. I can only tell you the Cantonese restaurant across from the street probably knows better how to prepare duck. \n\nThe desert is sesame ice cream on top of a bed of crusted nuts. It's actually not bad, just not something too special. It's easy to prepare in advance and requires no baking time. \n\nYou might think \"okay maybe you're just too picky so when others have so many good things to say about this restaurant, your'e just being a hater!\"\n\nNow what's wrong with my experience?  (service) \n\nHere comes the TWO MAJOR reasons why I urge you never visit this place. 1. They serve food in broken, chipped dishes. COME ON! You're a Michelin 1 star restaurant. This is simply not supposed to happen to any restaurant. No to mention if you want your customer to spend $130 at your restaurant. This complaint was mentioned in previous reviews from others and apparently the restaurant thinks there's no need to at least make sure the dishes are not broken before they bring it out. I don't care if you're a fancy restaurant or not, It should be a very basic common sense that you just don't serve food in broken chipped dishes to your customers because it really just tells us that you don't give a dime about how we feel!!!\n\nThe 2nd reason why I'd never go back nor I'd recommend anyone to go is because our waitress was extremely cold and indifference. She's a tall caucasian lady with blond hair in her mid or late 30s. She didn't ask us once how we liked our food or if we need anything else, nor did she smile at us once (at first I thought she was just having a bad day then I can accept that as an excuse until I realized she was smiling at other customers from other tables). When I told her we noticed our dishes are chipped (3rd course) and we'd prefer the restaurant staff paid attention to this later, she simply said \"OK\" (without smile or a simple \"I'm sorry\"). I didn't want her to feel we're rude customers so even when I brought this request up, I was smiling and being polite.  Of course she didn't care so we ended up having two more broken dishes coming later. \n\nI believe her unprofessional service really jeopardized our experience. After all, we visit a Michelin-starred restaurant hoping to have a satisfying dining experience not just for food, but also a warm, friendly service. I do not believe Commonwealth deserves a star at all based on my experience. \n\nFinal thought: I asked a  friends who had a good experience at Commonwealth, she said the service she received was good (wish the service could be more consistent) and also she didn't go for tasting menu. I was thinking if I only spent $ 50 dollars instead of $130 I'd probably be less upset. So if you must visit this restaurant even after you read my terrible experience, at least skip the tasting menu.", "author": "El L."}

I didn't get the pairing but my friend did. The food was good but I didn't love every dish, split right down the middle. Rating torn between a 3 and a 4 star. Because presentation was beautiful, service was off the charts great. Our table was always clean and water was always filled. But only one dish I think was simply amazing. \n\n*Homemade Chips - It was great start to our meal. Very light and crispy. \n*Hawaiian Hamachi Crudo - Fresh and love all the flavor. One bite. \n*Smoked trout and its roe, preserved bergamot, marble potato, dill, chilled pea soup - You can  taste its a smoked trout. I did enjoy all the flavors but my friend did not. He believe the smoked taste is way too strong, too strong to taste the fish. \n\n*SCALLOP - asparagus, shiso, bird's eye chili, lime confit, ginger and citrus dashi\n- the highlight of all the dishes. this was one amazing dish. the technique to make it like it shape and presented was mind blowing. very light in flavor but just enough to taste the scallop. \n\n*Squid noodles - cucumber, basil seed, nasturtium oil, horseradish cream. - Love the texture of the squid. Cooked perfect. Love the basil seed added. \n*Crushed fava bean, cauliflower, shaved turnip, sumac, caramelized yogurt, radish green ice - My least favorite dish. Way too cold because of the ice. Did not like the flavors and texture of this dish at all. \n*Lamb shoulder grilled over redwood, spring garlic, beets, walnut butter, mint, seaweed - It was a good piece of meat but I do not like lamb. But I never ask if I can change it because I'm still finding that one restaurant to prove to me that lamb is yummy. The sauce was great but I only took a bite and gave the rest to my friend. \n*Celery sorbet, verjus soda - I know this is stupid but way too much celery. Way too short for my taste for a sorbet. \n-Salted date ice cream, pumpkin seed croquant, black sesame caramel - This was very good. the pumpkin see croquant was amazing. Love the flavors and the crunch to each bite. Not too sweet too.\n\nI do want to give it another try.", "author": "Sandy B."}

It was suggested to my husband and I on a tour we took to Sonoma and Napa Valley. We decide to come here for my birthday dinner. It's a small restaurant but the staff is really nice. Our waiters name was Stefanie and she was very helpful and nice. \n\nNow about the food... the food that we ordered was ok. I liked two dishes but didn't care for two dishes. Also, I think this restaurant is a little over priced per dish for the size of the dish. It's kind of like tapas but most tapas aren't $15-$20 per dish. \n\nThey start by bringing you house made seaweed chips with a vinegar foam dip. These chips were good and good with the dip. At first the dip was interesting and different but then I got use to it. It reminded me of a Salt & Vinegar Chip with the dip. For our meals we ordered the Young Hen, Root Vegetables, Truffle Dumplings, and Pork Belly. My favorite dishes were the Young Hen and the Dumplings. The Young Hen was served with a sauce, sliced carrots, pearl onions, sprouted grain, and a really good sauce. It was seasoned well and the hen was nice and tender. I really liked this dish. The Dumplings were also very good. It had Bok Choy, garlic black pearls and a mushroom broth. Awesome! The flavor this dish had was just very good. My least favorite was Root Vegetables and the Pork Belly. I love vegetables and was excited about this dish but I honestly did not like the flavor profile of this dish. The yogurt that is included in this dish is overpowering and super tart. Not a good balance in my opinion. It did have a red sweet sauce but like I said the yogurt flavor was a little over powering. I like yogurt but it was like they didn't do anything to it. It was just plain yogurt. Yuck! I like flavored yogurts. The Pork Belly pairings that create the flavor profile was good but I personally don't like Pork Belly. My husband wanted this dish. I just don't like that Pork Belly has so much fat and so little meat, so I only took one bite of this and didn't eat anymore. I guess the Pork Belly is more of a personal preference rather than a real dislike as far as taste or flavor profile. \n\nLike I said our waiter was really nice and because it was my birthday she brought my husband and I house made Marshmallows & Caramel Bites. These were pretty good and I honestly don't like straight caramel. It has be be with chocolate for me to eat but these were good. Thanks Stefanie!! \n\nOverall, I don't think I would come back to Commonwealth just because the food just wasn't what I personally liked and the size of the dishes don't match the prices. I honestly got full off of the chips and I'm glad I did because had I not I might have been really hungry. The staff was great it was just the menu & flavor profile itself that was a little off to me. Even the desserts were like .. what?! Just not my cup of tea, and I'm a huge foodie. This is the first time I haven't really liked a restaurant based off of flavor profile and price. I also get really upset when restaurants don't have good desserts or weird desserts. This is always a bummer for me.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

This is by far probably the nicest building in a quarter to half mile radius (being in Mission district). \n\nFood 3.5/5\nThe presentation of the dishes were all excellent. However I only really enjoyed two dishes out of the five dishes I ate.\n- Shaved Zucchini and Swordfish were my two favorite dishes where I felt the taste of everything really was delicious and came together as a whole.\n- Smoked Chanterelles was delicious. The mushrooms were cooked very well and had a lot of flavor to it when you eat it with a bit of everything in a single bite. What I enjoyed most about this dish was the black mole and the huitlacoche custard. There was so much flavor in both those components it really went well with the mushrooms.\n- Sea Urchin was good but not excellent. Felt like there could have been more flavor to it but I just felt like I was just eating a salad with like two roes of sea urchin. Kind of tasted like a very plain deconstructed salad but without lettuce.\n- Shrimp mousse was an okay dish for me. The mousse tasted extremely shrimpy. I cannot really remember anything about this dish that stood out to me at all.\n\nService 5/5\nComing into this restaurant we were greeted and seated right away since we had a reservation and were the first people in. Once my girlfriend and I would finish our plate, they would immediately come and clear our table and prepare it for the next plates to come.

The street is dirty and dingy, the exterior of the building derelict, a burned out theater is on the corner, and the people hanging around the area give one pause.  You have to look for a door to enter, which happens to be on the side of a small parking lot. \n\nThe inside is small, cramped, contemporary, and crowded with tables that resemble a diner.  By 5:45pm, every table was filled and in order to get up, the person at the neighboring table needs to move too.  \n\nBut as soon as the servers greet you, there is no denying that this will be a first rate dining adventure.  Sweet potato chips are on the table to nibble while perusing the menu. It has two columns, a prix fixe six course extravaganze at $80 per person on the left, or a la carte on the right offering eleven mouth watering options with prices in the $18-$20 per dish range. What we appreciated about Commonwealth is that substitutions are allowed on the prix fixe from the right hand column at no additional charge. Sparkling or still water is offered and the servers are knowledgeable, expertly-trained, and excellent at explaining every ingredient in every dish. Each plate is tiny with only a few exquisite bites, many dishes served on handmade pottery.  Corkage is $25. The food is so delicious that it is dreamy.  On our visit, we were titillated with an amuse bouche followed by courses of oyster, crab, seaweed & fois gras brioche, sea urchin, root vegetables, duck breast, sablefish with abalone, celery sorbet, date ice cream, caramel and marshmallow candies. The savory and the sweet were perfectly created and presented. Three hours were spent salivating over this spectacular meal.\n\nOne thing that we all truly appreciated is that Commonwealth donates a percentage to a charity. I hope they will one day choose Be the Star You Are!\u00ae to empower women, families, and youth. www.BetheStarYouAre.org . ALWAYS a plus to give back to the community through contributions. \n\nWhen we left, we didn't care about the location or the d\u00e9cor, all we could utter is that Commonwealth gave us one of the best birthday meals any of us had ever experienced.

Talk about a foodie's dream - every dish my friend and I had were like works of art and with good lighting, I couldn't have picked out a more picturesque situation.  That being said, let's get back to why I'm giving it 3 stars.\n\nCommonwealth has been on my radar for a long time, and for various reasons, it's just taken me that long to stop by here. My friend I had decided to finally commit to it and eat an early dinner here during the week.  We decided to forgo the pre-fix option and went a la carte instead.  The delicious chips that were brought to the table was a great way to start (and let's face it, everyone likes chips in any form).  After perusing over the menu, here's what we went with:\n\nAppetizer/Starter:\n- Grilled carrots, white sesame, sprouting lentils, flax cracker, sorrel sorbet\n- Gulf shrimp, coconut milk, tapioca, avocado, & wheatgrass broth\n\nI should start off by saying that the dishes throughout our entire meal aren't shareable.  Think elf-sized food portions.  I had the gulf shrimp dish and found it interesting.  The tapioca addition was a little strange, but I certainly ate all of it. My friend didn't love the flax cracker and found it to be a weird texture and consistency.\n\nSecond Course:\n- Smoked mussels, broccoli, hazelnuts, fermented ramps, horseradish cream\n- Asparagus, nori, charred leek relish, togarashi, meyer lemon, egg yolk jam & breadcrumbs\n\nI had the asparagus, and when they say asparagus, they mean four thin stalks bound together by some seaweed.  Literally.  The egg yolk jam and breadcrumbs were definitely delicious, and I really loved the creamy texture and sweet/sour taste of the meyer lemon.\n\nMain Course:\n- Pork belly, peruvian potato, red cabbage, kale, anchovy & fresh wasabi\n- Young hen, ramps, turnips, nettles, puffed rice, saffron, razor clam jus\n\nI had the young hen dish and despite it being a little underseasoned, it was super tender and juicy, and I loved the puffed rice that came with it for texture. The bright yellow saffron & razor clam jus was good; it was so yellow that you could easily confuse it for egg yolk.  Like everything else, not a big portion of food, but certainly tasty.\n\nDessert: Rosewater ice cream with strawberries, pistachios\n\nHonestly, the dessert was the best thing we had all night. Our server recommended this to us and we both licked the plate clean.  The fresh strawberries and the rosewater ice cream was absolutely a dynamic duo of a combination.  \n\nService wise, our server was pleasant and gave us a good sense of the a la carte menu.  The initial dish seemed to come out pretty slowly, but the rest of the meal seemed to go be paced really well.  With how small the portions are relative to the price that we paid, I have a hard time wanting to come back here. While nothing we had was offensive or not well prepared, the dishes were just sort of OK.  I'm glad we checked out Commonwealth, but outside of the dessert we had, everything else was just sort of meh.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Gentrification at its finest.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I came here to celebrate our recent engagement. The hostess gave us a choice to dine at a regular table or at the bar by the kitchen where we can watch the chefs in action. Of course we chose the bar because it adds to the dining experience! We were offered complimentary celebratory champagne which was a very sweet gesture from our server! We also ordered a bottle of the Pineau D'Aunis Ros\u00e9 from Loire Valley, France which tasted crisp and refreshing.\n\nDecisions are too hard, so we immediately agreed on the 6 course tasting menu. It was really dark in the restaurant, which made it difficult to visually appreciate our dishes. Luckily, I took pictures and it wasn't until I looked at the pictures on my phone the next day, I realized how beautiful and colorful the dishes were! \n\nMy favorites were:\n\nPoached oysters, potatoes cooked in clay, kombu, spinach, squid ink meringue - This dish was amazing because it had so many textural elements to it in every bite! It felt like a party in my mouth.\n\nSesame and nori coated avocado, charred romaine, popcorn, togarashi, yuzu kosho milk - Perfectly ripened avocado with crunchy nori, creamy sauce and popcorn?! Delicious and creative!\n\nCelery Sorbet with verjus soda - I'm not a big fan of celery, but this sorbet surprised me! It acted as a palate cleanser; the fizzy soda tingled and cleaned up my taste buds and prepped it for the finale...dessert!!!\n\nBeer Meringue, chocolate ganache, pretzel crumble, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream - Another dish exploding in textural and flavorful surprises! The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream was light and creamy, chocolate ganache was rich and bittersweet, beer meringue airy and chewy, pretzel crumble was crunchy and crumbly! All these elements bonded together into perfection. I was impressed.\n\nThe only downside is, I wish our bottle of ros\u00e9 was kept in a bucket of ice because it started to taste warm around the 4th course. Overall, the service was wonderful and it was amazing to watch the chefs work together in such sync and harmony without having to speak to one another. It's as if they can read each other's minds.

Came here on a Tuesday evening with three other people, and didn't really know what to expect. The restaurant is very unassuming from the outside, but when you step in you are transported to this chic, modern, cavernous space. The vaulted ceiling and disco ball is one of the more prominent features of the space, and the rest is pretty minimalistic. While I'm not a big fan of tasting menus (typically not enough food for too high of a price), we took one look at the tasting menu and all decided to go to for it. Not only did every dish sound exciting and delicious, but I found the price $80 to be very reasonable given the amount and quality of food we were given).\n\nTheir beer and wine list isn't super extensive, but very well-curated. Our server was able to give very good recommendations based on our preferences as well as what we were eating. The first thing that comes out is a bowl of homemade potato chips with nori on it, with this insanely cool vinegar foam dip. We knew we were in for a treat. Every single dish that arrived at our table was unique, beautifully plated, and equally as delicious. The portion sizes were on the small size, but by no means the one-bite dish that you sometimes get with a tasting menu. \n\nI'm not sure I can pick out a favorite dish, BUT the group of us was blown away by the dungeness crab dish which came with these insane foie gras stuffed brioche balls. Another dish that really stood out to be was the poached oyster dish - the combination of flavors (green tea, lemon, apple, wasabi) was a culinary experience on its own. Normally dessert is my least favorite course, but the celery sorbet with soda verjus was one of the coolest things I've ever tried. Who would have guessed that celery sorbet could be so tasty?! The salted date ice cream with black sesame caramel was also a huge hit. \n\nBasically we spent the entire meal ooh and ahhing over everything we ate. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to those wanting to experience a tasting menu-type meal without the formal atmosphere or high price point.

Hubby didn't like the seafood choices but they did let him sub the oysters for the pork belly from the a la carte menu. \n\nThey have a small parking lot right next to the restaurant but we didn't know about it. Parking is $5 in their lot. You enter thru the side door via the parking lot.  Wait staff was OK. Not terribly friendly. Do not think I saw our waitress smile at all. The entire waitstaff was female when we were there. \n\nThe memorable small plates were the bread rolls, salad which was plated off to one side.  We all commented about the asymmetric effect as if they gave you only a 1/2 plate of food or left something out. The salad was delish.  The celery sorbet was different. I wouldn'tt order it for dessert but it was unusual.  The crab was bland and the oysters didn't taste that good.  \n\nI think they meant to char the lettuce on one dish but the lettuce tips and what looked like black burnt nuts?

I asked for her opinion on 2 separate occasions (one about wine and one about a starter) and she straight up just said we had to try the two dishes that just happened to be the most expensive on the list. Ugh. I've done sales lady, I know it drives up your tip. But whatever. The only friendly face we saw all night was one of the servers who poured our waters.

Seriously, the furikake on there is BOMB. \n\nNext, the Uni starter. So bland... how do you make uni gross? There are these weird tapioca textured balls on top of essentially a cracker. There are maybe.... 3 pieces of uni (also kind of old because it was SUPER fishy and not sweet at all) And in the mess there are some chunks of bread and grilled watermelon and a mess of flavors that sound good but taste gosh darn awful together.

My previous trip to Europe was to hit at least one Michelin rated restaurant in each country and it has been our objective as of late.\n\nThat being said, there is still the question of cost and since I'm still a little green at spending $1,000 on a tasting menu (I would rather choose to apply that $1k to a new camera lens, for example) seeking out more affordable options becomes a priority as well.\n\nCommonwealth is located on the dirtier street in the Mission but don't let the trash and inhabitants deter you.  Behind the opaque glass windows, lies a veritable space that is welcome and warm.  Add in their palpable tasting menu and the experience will leave you skipping out in joy.  Remember that scene from the Pixar's animation, Ratatouille?  The scene where the rats are experimenting with cheese and the melding of flavors?  Every plate here is a fusion of everything.  Sample each piece by itself and there is nothing.  Take a small bite of everything that will fit on your fork and it was a kaleidoscope of flavors.\n\nOur tasting menu:\n\n-Geoduck clams, fermented turnip, almond, coastal succulents, chilled buttermilk soup\nI'm not a big fan of clams but since I was a child, use to accompany the family on annual clamming season digging up these big suckers.  Geoduck clam necks can extend easily past 6 feet and the limit was only 3 per person.  They are also much more tender than the Horseneck clams, which were more plentiful.  So while I grew up digging for them, I was not a big fan of their necks unless it was battered and fried.  That being said, their collaboration with the freshness of the clam and the roasted crunch of the almond nuts elevated the flavor of one bite.  \n\n-Seared diver scallop, white miso, corn, tarragon, fennel, rooftop herbs\nBeautifully tender and soft.  I don't know how they are able to keep it so intact.\n\n-Charred stonefruit, summer squash, sunflower pesto, nasturtium sorbet\nA combination I would have never thought up, amazingly fresh and lively.\n\n-Grilled beef, charred little gems, romesco, black olive, charred alliums, meyer lemon\nSomething classic but very good.  \n\n-Celery sorbet, verjus soda \nThe perfect palate cleanser yet fresh and vibrant.\n\n-Salted date ice cream, pumpkin seed croquant, black sesame caramel\nBlack sesame seed seems to be the roasted seed of the moment but I love the earthy and nutty aspect it gives not only to savory items but desserts as well.\n\nEverything was amazing, right down to the service and seating.  The wait staff here quick to ascertain and respond to requests and the interior, simple and comfortable, like the kitchen table of a small inn in Strasbourg.\n\nThank you for a fabulous evening!  I look forward to the next seasonal menu  :)", "author": "Miika M."}

And that could be a problem for me because I'm generally meat-focused. But tonight with the tasting menu I was as happy as a pig in a truffle patch. \n\nAll the things that blew me away were vegetable-focused: okra tempura first course, charred cucumber third course, and especially the celery sorbet palate refresher. When then the meat finally arrived (a perfectly grilled specimen of lamb) I was a little disappointed at its one-dimensional nature. Then when they served up a little gummy dessert at the very end (after the official dessert) made from tomato water, that was like that final flick from Ronda Rousey that makes the recipient wave the white flag. Except, unlike her opponents, I can't wait for a return match.\n\ni HIGHLY recommend you request the seat or seats immediately adjacent to the kitchen at the bar, and watch the precision and the detail play out before you. Only negative to this spot is that it's too dark to see your beautifully plated food, so you'll have to watch the magic come together in the kitchen.\n\nI will second those who say this is an astonishing value in addition to the quality and sheer inventiveness (gelled sake spheres! freeze dried squid ink! both making an appearance in my oyster dish) and scratch my head at those who complain there's not enough food. I left more than satisfied, and I've got a big appetite. \n\nAn easy five stars.", "author": "Otis M."}

I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the food. The presentation is beautiful, but there was no wow factor to the food. The portions were also extremely small, which wouldn't have bothered me as much if the food was delicious, but every bite was disappointing. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and made a few recommendations, but she was a little snooty and wasn't the friendliest waitress. We ordered 5 dishes, which we shared amongst 3 people, but we were still hungry afterwards. \n\nAlbacore crudo- there was nothing really memorable about the dish and portions were super small. \n\nSea urchin- the uni tasted fresh, but the herbs, wasabi sauce, and whatever else was in the dish didn't add anything to elevate the dish. \n\nSeared squid- this was probably the best dish we had, but still didn't do anything to impress us. I was really disappointed that it only came with 2 small pieces of squid. The flavor was good though.\n\nYoung hen- this dish felt like it was missing something. I think the hen needed more flavor. \n\nSablefish- The fish was seared perfectly, but the flavor was a little lacking. \n\nWe ended up going to a taqueria down the street after we left, which ironically had better food and was packed with people. \n\nOverall a very disappointing experience that cost us around $200. I will not be coming back or recommending this restaurant to anyone.", "author": "Mai Y."}

Service was good (team style where anyone who is available serves you) but the woman who took our drink order could not hear me well so I had to scream a bit more than I'd like in a restaurant. \n\nI admire the philanthropic concept of the restaurant - $10 from each tasting menu order is donated to a local charity - but the disclaimer on the tasting menu is slightly unclear and was not clearly explained to us. \"Participation is required by the entire table.\" Does that mean if one person has the tasting menu, everyone at the table must participate? Does it mean at least one person at the table must have the tasting menu? Or is it one of the many other ways that can be interpreted? Maybe my boyfriend and I are just dense, but after asking our server, we were unclear on the policy. Luckily we both wanted the tasting menu. \n\nIt started with house chips dusted in nori and served with a whipped vinegar. This was absolutely delicious and lightly crispy (like kettle chips) and I could eat a whole bowl of it while watching a football game. Classy, right?\n\nThere was also a foamy bowl of something fancy and refreshing - sorry, Yelp, I forgot what was in it. :( but that was quite interesting. \n\nOnto the six courses:\n\ncrispy okra, trout roe, corn pudding, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, piment d'espelette, garden basils - lightly crispy and a nice balance in flavors. Okra still slightly slimy but there's no getting around that. 4/5\n\npoached oysters, potatoes cooked in clay, kombu, spinach, squid ink meringue - oysters perfectly poached and the squid ink meringue was very interesting and tasted like chocolate, somehow. Maybe a product of \"eating with your eyes\"?  My one complaint about this dish was that the potatoes' skin was shriveled and hardened in its cooking process such that I took a wrong angled bite and it sort of painfully lodged in between two of my molars. 4/5\n\nfresh and pickled cucumber, burnt avocado, whipped buttermilk, dill, elderflower vinegar - this was my boyfriend's favorite, but he likes sour things. The pickles were of varying degrees of acidity, balanced nicely with the rich avocado and the buttermilk. The char on the avocado wasn't really necessarily, as it gave the dish a smokiness that tasted like a barbecue that had been left burning too long. 4/5\n\ngrilled lamb, plum, black garlic, turnip, shiso, lemongrass, nori crisp - I didn't care for the seasoning on this at all (sweet and bitter) and scraped off all of the sauce. The lamb itself was not super tender but cooked medium to medium rare. The turnip was just barely cooked and not pleasant. 3/5\n\ncelery sorbet, verjus soda - \n\nbeer meringue, chocolate ganache, pretzel crumble, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream\n\nAll of the dishes were beautifully plated and each element of each dish seemed to be thoughtfully put together. There was just enough food to fill us, but no dish (besides the house chips) really left us wanting more.", "author": "Christina G."}

Honestly, we had seen it one night we were coming back from another restaurant and we definitely thought it would be an interesting dinner location for us. \n\nThere are two menus to change from.  One a la carte and the other was the tasting menu. I gave the boyfriend a choice of which one to get and he decided on the a la carte. Definitely a great choice, but the tasting menu looked amazing too.\n\nI started with the foie gras and he the stone fruit dish. The foie gras was nice and fatty which it should be but there definitely wasn't enough cracker to foie gras. To finish we used the chips they start your night off with. The stone fruit appetizer was on the tasting menu and was super interesting. There was grilled stone fruit with this delicious herb-y sorbet. \n\nFor our second course he got an interesting tempura mushroom dish and I got smoked mussels with mushroom veloute. Definitely enjoyed the mushroom veloute with my dish since it was creamy and so smooth. The mussels and the squash blossom on my dish was also amazing. \n\nAs our last savory course we got the hen and pork belly. The pork belly was so awesome. Definitely my favorite dish of the night. His hen was okay but definitely not as good as mine. \n\nWe finished our night off with some chocolate ganache which was okay but not amazing. \n\nDefinitely the highlight drink wise was my Yellow Cup no 5. It was like a boozy sorbet. Love!! \n\nOverall, we both had an amazing time here and will be back! \n\nPro tip: get a reservation and definitely try the boozy sorbet like drink.", "author": "Nina Y."}

They had the availability and secured my reservation.  \n\nThe manager handling large party reservations claimed to have called me on my cell phone and work line to secure a credit card information. I never received any calls on my cell phone or my office line, let alone any voicemails. \n\nThey asked for the best numbers to contact me at and I verified both lines and times to be contacted. Since I gave this information to them at their request, I expected calls back. Needless to say, I didn't receive any calls or voicemails. \n\nNow, I left voicemails with all my contact information since then with no calls back and was not going to leave credit card info in a voicemail. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks later with no luck in contacting them, getting a call back or giving my credit card info. Now I contacted them via email to increase our reservation. They couldn't which was understandable. They then asked for a credit card which I asked them to call me for the details. They then asked me to call them. Which I did and received nothing but voicemail. \n\nSince I could not get a hold of them I sent the manager Xelina my credit card information via email. Not ideal but I had no choice given the difficulty in connecting with Xelina.  \n\nOf course they ran it and it was declined. I work for a large company and my purchase card was maxed. Since this was done outside of my working hours I thought I would be ok in providing another card this morning. I provided another card, however low and behold Xelina cancelled my 13 person reservation for my team that evening. I did not find out about this cancellation until I tried to provide another card in the morning. The response to providing another card over email was that my reservation has been cancelled and given to another party. \n\nThe only reason was that I did not provide a credit card in time to hold the reservation despite all my voicemails , my calls  and no calls back etc.  \n\nThere was no understanding, no communication, no coordination from Xelina. Xelina claimed to have explained the credit card policy in her first email however scrolling back it was never mentioned. Then as I tried to get my reservation back she stated that they needed a card 7 days prior to the event. My event was scheduled for May 10. At the time I was 2 weeks away from the date and didn't understand why my reservation was dropped. Not to mention I was only told it was dropped after contacting them! They should have told me this was what they were going to do prior to taking action and prior to allowing me the time to respond with another corporate card given that she was well aware of my work on hours as I listed them at 3 different points in our email exchange. Then when speaking with Xelina over the phone she said that 1. The credit card policy was stated in the first email, which it was not and 2. That they needed a card upon booking. It seems as though the timing of when the card was needed kept changing to justify the fact that my reservation was completely dropped. \n\nMany restaurants provide credit card authorization forms, or just simply call their customers back. When mentioning the difficulty in connecting with Xelina, she claimed there were attempted calls etc. I also mentioned other solutions that she could have tried to get the information she needed. The response was that I should have let her know sooner and then she would work with me. It is not my job to provide suggestions as to how a restaurant manager should manage the process of booking a reservation, this is the restaurants responsibility.\n\nNow I understand how the restaurant business works as my husband is an executive chef and am appalled at the lack of customer service and the quick resolution to just cancel a party prior to any clear communication. Again, I have also made many many many dinner reservations for my company and team, and this by far has been the worst experience I have had.\n\nNeedless to say this feedback will be shared within my company's community. \n\nSuch a shame that a restaurant with great food has such limited customer service. \n\nGiven this experience, it's hard to say that I will try scheduling another dinner here.", "author": "Alyssa G."}

In fact, the Mission seems to harbor many of these hidden culinary gems hidden in plain sight. We are truly lucky to be living in this neighborhood - so many secrets here. I digress though.\n\nThe restaurant itself is cozy, with an open kitchen and frosted windows to block the outside world. The frosted windows are most likely to block the possible un-pleasantries of Mission Street such as a hobo relieving himself just as you receive your main course. I'm all for the social support the city provides, but we all have our limits. :)\n\nAnyhow - onto the food!\n\nMy date and I decided on the a la carte menu so we could try seven unique dishes instead of sharing the same tasting menu plates. \n\nListed in order of favorites.\n\n1) Uni, butternut squash, puffed barley, black walnut, squash consomme.\nAmazing. Even my date who doesn't usually like Uni loved it. There was a sweetness from the butternut squash and squash consomme that paired very well with the uni. Along with some crunch from the puffed barley and walnut - you got nuttiness ending with the creaminess of the Uni. I think they also shaved some Yuzu skin all over the dish which just added another level of amazing.\n\n2) Potato, bone marrow, cabbage, black garlic, preserved lemon aioli, Cabbage glass.\nWow. Technically and artistically amazing. There was a sheet of cabbage glass laid on top. Think a thin sheet of translucent paper that has a strong essence of cabbage. Wtf. There was also what seemed like pickled sweet cabbage, which you mixed with the bone marrow sauce, black garlic, aioli, and smoked potato. Combined - such a symphony of flavors.\n\n3) Young hen, parsnip, white chocolate, grapefruit, almond and chicken skin crumble.\nSuper interesting dish. They took a piece of young hen and crisped up the skin. Another piece of hen was sous vide'd. White chocolate shavings all over including what seemed like a sauce that had some white chocolate, almond, and chicken skin. Just an amazing dish. The white chocolate worked so well with the hen. \n\n4) Pickled Mackerel, egg noodle, sweet potato fritter, charred turnip, salsify, trout roe.\nOne of the most beautiful dishes of the night - There was dashi broth turned into agar jelly scattered with beautiful pieces of mackerel. Add in a sweet potato fritter topped with trout roe. Just an amazing art piece and perfect if you love the essence of seafood.\n\n5) Sablefish, ember roasted chile, fennel, olive, puffed rice crackers, black lime.\nA solid dish with some bite - the chile really added a nice kick to this dish. Just hot enough to make you sweat but not so much that your taste buds were singed. I definitely loved the play between the sablefish and the sauce. \n\n6) The complimentary homemade seaweed potato chips with malt vinegar foam.\nI really loved this - the malt vinegar foam totally coated the chips and upon contact with your tongue, the micro air bubbles spread across everywhere, lending an interesting complex flavor.\n\n6) Sesame and nori avocado, popcorn, charred romaine, togarashi, yuzu kosho milk.\nI heard so much about this dish but wasn't wowed by it. To me it just tasted like a salty avocado wrapped in seaweed. I would have hoped for more crunchiness as the avocado was very ripe - a texture differential would have been nice here. \n\nService was very attentive and the waiters were very knowledgeable about every component on each dish.\n\nI would totally come back again to try any new seasonal items on the menu.", "author": "Henry W."}

There's an awesome hidden message there that resonates well with the restaurant being located in the mission.\n\n[Experience-specific complaints that probably won't apply to other diners that I want to call out that caused the experience to be 3/5 stars]\nWhile I enjoyed the ambiance in the beginning of my meal, two extremely rude, drunk, loud, and racist diners were seated next to us, effectively denting the amazing experience my taste buds were having. One looked like a straight douchebag out of a movie, wearing a pinstriped suit and an ego way too big for his ugly personality. His dining companion, an Asian woman, openly and loudly started criticizing the dating habits of Asian women who date people of other races. Given that I am also an Asian woman and I was seated with a Caucasian dining companion probably a couple inches away from her table, I could hear everything she said and since I made eye contact with her while she was saying it, she was encompassing me into this conversation I didn't want to be a part of. She was speaking in a very rude volume that was meant for me and my companion to hear, and also for the rest of the tiny restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable, but didn't want the passive-aggressive commentary to ruin my night. Looking back, I wished I had brought this instance up to the hostess or dining staff who were also within hearing distance of this very racist conversation. I was disappointed that the restaurant didn't speak up to ask the party of racist 2 to lower their voices. A very sad setback to the amazing hidden roof message in the restaurant.\n\nTo the hostess, I discretely asked in the beginning of the meal if she could maybe include a candle for the desert since it was my dining partner's birthday. She forgot. It was a pretty important request that I think a restaurant of Michelin-star quality should have the ability to remember.\n\n[Tasting Menu]\nThe duck was spectacular - definitely the highlight of the tasting menu. I also enjoyed the celery sorbet as a pallet cleanser before the desert. I was not a fan of the oysters even though I normally enjoy them on the half shell. Plating of the salad made it feel like I wasn't eating salad - It was a really fresh spin on salad! \n\n[D\u00e9cor]\n6/5. Extra credit for the d\u00e9cor. Look at the ceiling!\n\n[Service]\n3/5. Great explanations of each dish as well as spacing. Notch down for the hostess and the tolerance for the intolerant diners next to me.", "author": "Alice Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-12", "description": "Short version: very accommodating for special diets; excellent, creative cuisine. \n\nLong version: \nThe food is excellent--5 stars if just that.  The chef is paying close attention to the balance of flavors and textures in every single dish (and we had the tasting menu, plus one dish, so a lot of dishes).  Always sweet/salty/savory and soft/crunchy were represented.  Every dish made us say \"interesting!\" \"clever!\" \"delicious!\"  One very memorable dish was scallop which had essentially been turned into a \"pasta\" sheet shape. Very tasty and very interesting prep. Iron chef-worthy. \n\nAlso 5 stars on food for CREATIVITY and accommodation for special diets.  When we reserved, we wrote down 1 person in our party as lactose intolerant.  A lot of chefs won't bother to make any or much change in their plans, and I think a chef who does, and does it well, proves (s)he is a good, creative cook.  1) our waitress acknowledged our note about special diet and 2) asked if we were ready for her to go over the menu and tell us what changes could be made.  Great!  3) She knew EXACTLY what had dairy and what type of dairy.  Most servers usually don't. 4) she knew what the changes would be and was specific (\"on this we'd substitute the x for y\".  5) The substitutions did not make me feel like I was missing something.  Ok, my husband's dessert had black sesame ice cream topping with salted caramel in it, which I tasted, and boy was it good.  But my non-dairy dessert had fabulous flavors as well. 6)There were creamy items on the regular menu which were not dairy-based.  This included a palate cleanser of celery sorbet with ver jus, a miso custard made with soy milk, and the appetizer's frothy dip.  The folks next to us had an aversion to garlic and onion, and I saw them accommodate them very nicely too, totally replacing at least one item on the tasting menu with another that was not anywhere on the menu. \n\nService: very good.  They actually take away dirty silverware after each course and replace for the next course, which I appreciate.  So many restaurants seem averse to the idea of washing more forks.  Our table was also cleared of crumbs several times, and the water stayed full. One of the waitstaff, though courteous, had a few missteps, but overall it was professional and the mistakes not large. \n\nAmbiance: dressy/casual.  Consider that if you take BART here (which we did) you walk three blocks through some gritty SF areas.  16th ST is not the cleanest station, and it pretty much smells the same for the whole 3 blocks.  So the dress here is mostly jeans with nice shoes and tops.  It's white tables inside and boarded up buildings as your view across the street. I see another reviewer said the dishes were chipped.  I noted this as well, but also there is a nice variety of dishware in the Japanese aesthetic of matching dish to food.  Bathrooms get a B+.  They were pretty clean.  Buts, as seems to be the trend, they chose a \"candlelight\" ambiance for the bathrooms, and I'm not a fan.  You can't see the drips on the toilet seat in this lighting, nor your face in the mirror in case you wanted to freshen anything.  Politics: they displayed some messages about Trump, and while I'm not a fan of Trump, the \"F\" word on the ceiling is not what I want to look at as I sip my wine. \n\nSince the negatives were really minor, and the food excellent and the service very good/excellent, I would certainly return and recommend to others.", "author": "s t."}

The couple next to us were lovely and enhanced our enjoyment of the meal. \n\nWe selected the tasting menu and each ordered a glass of wine.

Each dish was described as it was placed in front of us and they answered any questions as we went along.  \n\nThe food was so delicious.  Each bite was exciting and enjoyable.  I had a hard time picking a favorite course.  We went in February 2017 so the menu included: beef tartare, oysters, crab, root vegetable salad, duck, celery sorbet, date ice cream, & honey caramels & poppyseed marshmallows. The presentation is beautifully done as well. Each table starts with homemade potato chips and a malt vinegar dipping foam. I was skeptical, but they were tasty- I was so sad when they were gone.\n\nI love that a portion of each tasting menu price is given to a charity each night.

The liver was extremely fatty, and it was well paired with the nuttiness of the oatmeal and the citrus flavors from the produce.\n\nCrispy Hen: hefty. The dish was perhaps the largest of the three that we ordered. The flavor was pretty standard.\n\nSeared and Pickled Black Trumpets: decadent. By far the best dish of the night, the black trumpets were extremely flavorful, and the flavor of the mushrooms were cleanly brought out by the golden rice that was mixed in to it.\n\nThe dessert was wonderful too, but the menu isn't featured online!

First off I want to say the ambiance at Commonwealth is wonderful and the staff is extremely helpful and nice.  However, the reason I'm only giving two stars is because of the food quality and food quantity.  The portion size at Commonwealth is ridiculously small.  After the waiter told us that 6 a la carte plates would be plenty for us to share, we figured 5 would be okay.  Little did we know that one plate of food at Commonwealth is literally just three bites.  In addition to the portion size being small, I felt the price of each plate was too steep for the underwhelming amount of food received.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-12", "description": "Went in with high hopes for Commonwealth, and was overall disappointed. Had the five course tasting menu which consisted of smoked trout, scallop, a salad, squash blossom, lamb, and a date dessert. \n\nThe trout was one of the two best dishes that we were served and was executed very well, but nothing too creative or original that I haven't had before. The scallop seemed to encapsulate what seemed to be the issue with most of the meal. The technique was very impressive, and the presentation was beautiful, but in the end, it didn't add anything in flavor and in fact, likely detracted. Instead of having a beautiful tasty scallop, we were served a ribbon of scallop that ate like a noodle and tasted like squid. The salad was just a straight miss for me and for the other diners I was with. The lamb had excellent flavors and was well done. However, the lamb I was served had to be 60% fat. If you're going to serve 3oz of lamb, please take the time to make sure that the pieces are the best you can put together. This course had the potential to be fantastic and was done in by carelessness. The highlight of the lamb dish was absolutely the walnut butter that complemented the meat and sauce beautifully. As a palate cleanser, we were served a celery sorbet, which is as bad as it sounds. I took one bite and immediately regretted it. \n\nThe desert was interesting and I enjoyed it. The seeds really gave it a nice nutty component and nice texture. Finally we were presented some after meal sweet bites. There was a chocolate bite which was fantastic and a lemongrass marshmallow. Yet another dish that left me asking \"why?\". I'm not sure who thought lemongrass was a good flavor for a marshmallow, especially paired with chocolate as a sweet course, but it wasn't.\n\nThe other big issue here was the pace of service. Course were coming out on average once every 30 minutes and our 5 course meal took 3 hours which was entirely too long. \n\nOverall, Commonwealth displayed some really impressive technique and produced some beautiful plates, but the flavors were not there. The theme of the meal from the bizarre flavor combinations, to the brutalized scallop was, sometimes more is less.", "author": "dan c."}

As those of us born within 10 days either side of Chrismakuh know, all birthday celebrations are postponed until at least January 5th.  I did my usual obsessive search through new places I've noted vs. tried and true special occasion spots.  This year I chose Commonwealth - a combination of the food reviews and the  fact that I love their donation of $10 for each prix fixe dinner eaten.  When we snaked a parking space right on Mission at 6 ish (meters don't need to be fed) only a block away, it felt destined.\n\nHad a little trouble finding the entrance (not under the address number on Mission, but on the side facing their parking lot), but once we were in, the whole outdoor scene was out of sight and out of mind.  Xelina (the manager/sommelier??) came over and introduced herself.  Nice touch, since I'd emailed in advance asking if they'd waive the rule about requiring the whole table to order if you want the prix fixe.  I'd mentioned in passing that I was my birthday dinner, not looking for any perks, and I appreciated that they subtly acknowledged it without doing something mortifying like singing.\n\nMy husband decided to live dangerously and we both ordered the prix fixe with wine pairing.  I never could figure out what the arrangement was with servers, since at one point or another during the evening we'd been served by pretty much every server.  I normally worry when this happens, because who do you go to if you have a problem, but we never had one, so it was fine.  I guess that's my way of saying the service was good - there when you need them, not when you don't, informative, yet not giving me a lecture.  I did have one question that went unanswered regarding the beef, which I'll note later.\n\nFrst, they brought out these totally addictive homemade potato chips seasoned with nori and a malt vinegar \"foam\" that were totally addictive. Then we started with two Amuse Bouche, scallop tartar (2.5*), demitasse of parsnip soup with vadouvan (3^) lovely creamy texture, a bit too sweet for me.  \n\nThe first course, perfectly poached oysters with finger lime (normally love this, but didn't detect it) Asian pear, and horseradish.  (4.5- this was my favorite.)  I had a hard time picking up most of the items in the description (the aforementioned lime, Asian pear, sorrel) and just barely got the horseradish.  So they just barely make it on truth in advertising, but no matter, it tasted wonderful.  I would have liked a little more.\n\nI was so looking forward to #2.  ( 4 )Some years ago we went to 5th Floor for my birthday dinner, and I was so looking forward to their uni flan and they were out of it, so when I saw \"dungeness crab, sea urchin, buddha's hand kosho, sea grape, shellfish custard\"  I thought my karma was turning. This would have been a 5 star item - the texture of the custard was smooth and creamy, good sized portions of very fresh crab and briny, just from the sea uni, but oddly there was a very pungent hot spicy component to the custard, not announced in the lengthy description, that overpowered the fresh seafood.  So close to wonderful, but...\n\n#3Fromage Blanc, pomegranate, walnut, chicories, persimmon leather. (3.5*) I truly liked this although I'm beginning to get a little irritated with how they call out every single ingredient.  It makes me think they will be there in some more starring role.  In this case, this was a tasty, palate cleaning salad.  The fromage blanc which was made to sound like the star, was a welcome and smooth, though minor, component of the dish.\n\n#4American Wagyu beef grilled with onions, kale, jus.(3.5*) I loved the rich flavors and silken textures here, but I have to confess (though by no means a wagyu expert) the meat was not what I expected.  I didn't seem to have the high fat content I expected and the melting mouthfeel I thought it would. Also had a slight hint of that livery flavor that sometimes comes with venison or other game meats.  That's when I asked about the cut.  The guy who served that dish said he wasn't sure what it was called, but said it was from \"the lower back\"  pointing to his kidney area.  I didn't bother to follow up further.\n\n#6 Beer Meringue, chocolate ganache, pretzel crumble, creme fraich ice cream (3*) Well first, I confess, I'm not much of a sweets person, but this was sooooooooo sweet.  The largest element was a square milk chocolate ganache that dominated everything.  The ice cream was very good, but not assertive to battle with that ganache.\n\n#Celery sorbet (3.5*)  Very confusing, but innovative.

We both ended up doing the vegetarian tasting menu. I was a bit nervous as I read so many reviews saying portions were ridiculously small. By the end of the meal we could not have eaten another bite. Some of the dishes were very filling and some were very light but it worked. I could see if you ordered ala carte and picked some of the lighter/smaller dishes you could feel hungry but if you do the tasting menu it should be fine. \n\nWe started with a carrot dish with some tofu paste and sunflower seed butter which was fantastic and very filling! One of our favorite dishes!! They followed with a very well portioned and filling saut\u00e9ed pumpkin dish with brussel sprouts etc... I am not a fan of pumpkin or brussel sprouts but this was great! The sauce was divine. Then it followed with a parsnip and vanilla cream tart. This was very rich and much better than I thought! However, it was a very small portion which worked really well in the tasting menu due to it's richness. Then followed a hazelnut milk custard with apples and kohlrabi w/mustard leaves and ginger ice. I really liked the custard and the different textures of the apple and Kohlrabi with the custard but the greens and ginger ice, though good, seemed to not really go with the dish. Again, this was a very light portion. This followed with a smoked chanterelles with both crispy and pureed potatoes with a black truffle sauce. It was delicious. The palette cleanser of the celery sorbet was a pretty large portion and not our favorite. The salted date ice cream with the black sesame caramel was really good. They ended it with a strange grapefruit infused marshmallow and a tiny cookie. \n\nMost of the food was really good. The chef is really adept with textures but the ginger ice with the mustard just did not work well. \n\nThe wine pairing was a bit off. The sommelier was very entertaining and told stories about each pour but offered me something else in case I did not like some of them which was appreciated as one I really disliked one. They had no reds just white wines and they included sherry and saki with some of the courses. I would say that was the least successful part of the meal. It's worth a try but we are not sure if we would spend $300 again for two and this was with just one wine pairing. We are grateful we both did not pay for it!!", "author": "Diana S."}

We arrived early and parked on the street, but sadly found out they had their own parking area. Bummer!\n\nThe tasting menu looked intricate, however, we opted to go for a la carte with the exception of having one of the tasting menu as our entree. We ordered:\n\n- Sea urchin, cauliflower, seaweed brioche, tapioca, ginger, kimchee, coastal succulents was divine. This by far was my favorite dish of the night!\n\n- Beef tartare, salted blackberries, elderflower capers, chervil, kefir, pumpernickel tuile  was ridiculously tasty.\n\n- Charred squid, pork belly, soft boiled egg, hay smoked potatoes, pickled onions, fine herbs. The tentacle of the squid was a little too chewy for my taste.\n\n- Sardines, honey melon, pickled cucumbers and zucchini. Sightly salty sardines, yet it was subtle due to the honey melon and the sweet sauce. Outstanding presentation.\n\n- Tea smoked duck with figs, herbs, and shallots from the tasting menu was disappointing. Very tough to chew on and the taste was bland. \n\n- Cods, liver mousse, turnips, parsley, and dashi broth was an interesting texture and very well put together. A balance of hearty food. \n\nWe were too full to get dessert, but I'll be sure to give it a try the next time I visit. \n\nI am thrilled to find this gem located in the Mission. Small, tidy, and unique. Service was attentive but lacking a smile on their face. All in all, give this place a try and enjoy!", "author": "Owie N."}

Thank god we had 4 bottles of wine to keep the dinner interesting.\n\nThe only thing ok was the scallop and the wagyu steak (2 slices of steak and a crap load of garnish....).\n\nI don't recommend this place and I don't plan to come back.

Well, two years later I finally had dinner here and I am kicking myself for not coming here earlier. This place does have a ridiculous amount of mixed reviews though which is slightly off putting so I'm glad I'm one of the diners that loved it! I loved it so much I recommended my cousin's boyfriend to make reservations at this place for their two year anniversary and they had a great time!\n\nMade slightly last minute reservations for the first seating on Sunday night and was there for a couple of hours. Mmm, love me a long dinner. \n\nHighlights: THEY HAVE EVERY KIND OF TASTING MENU! I love love love tasting menus but rarely get them because of the dreaded no substitution footnote most menus have but not only do they have regular tasting menus, they also have a pescetarian and a vegetarian one! What! NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY WILL ALSO LET YOU SUBSTITUTE ANY DISH YOU WANT WITH ONE FROM THEIR A LA CARTE MENU!!! Ridiculous. Can this place get any better?! I substituted the duck with their ever popular uni and it was amazing and I do not even like uni. \n\nThis is also one of the few places I've seen with a tasting menu for less than $100 and on top of that they also donate $10 to charity! Can this place do any wrong?! Nothing like helping yuppie scum feel better about dropping $$$ on a meal. I'm kidding. I'm just quoting some guy trying to sell his art down on Union Square who was all FUCK YOU YUPPIE SCUM to everyone who ignored him. Anyways, back to the tasting menu...six courses with an amuse bouche. I got the wine pairing and it was perfect to share with my boyfriend. He also got the wizards sleeve cocktail which was frozen with liquid nitrogen and had cocoa nibs mixed in and you eat it with a spoon.

Commonwealth just does not know how to cook venison.  The venison we had was undercooked and overly chewy. \n\nThe other disappointment was minor.  I had the wine pairing, and, as always with New American pairing, white wine was over represented.  I don't like white wine, so I will not emphasize this.\n\nWhile the venison can be improved by proper cooking techniques, and cooking to medium, the celery sorbet was also a disappointment.  It was in a sparkling sauce of some sort.  The sorbet itself was too sour to eat, but mixed with the sparkling sauce did make it edible.\n\nHits however were the salmon roe, sea urchin, abalone, as well as the Porcini Churro, with chocolate branches, and the complementary chocolate bonbons with kiwi strawberry candies.\n\nService was attentive, though the smaller dishes could have come out at a quicker pace.\n\nThey do have to work on that venison.  Perhaps grilled in strips or seared, but chewy and undercooked is not the way to go.", "author": "J H."}

Second time, work offsite, ordered the tasting menu, a couple overlaps with time before but varied and incredible. There were little touches to both visits that made this place stand out beyond the food.\n\nSo, I thought third time would be a guarantee for another perfect meal, so decided to come here for the special tasting menu on New Year's eve. I don't know if it was a new menu or new items they were trying out, but they tasted very bland and not complex like the times before.\n\n2 amuse bouche - 1st was a small piece of smoked fish, yummy, 2nd was truffle soup sip, also yummy.\n\n1st course - spot prawn crudo. Interesting texture, but very underseasoned and did not stand out.\n\n2nd course - dungeoness crab, sea urchine, rice porridge and thai spices. Texture was off, everything was soft and mushy with no relief from wet, moist texture.\n\n3rd course - beet and buckwheat agnolotti, black truffel, sorrel, charred onion broth. This was the most interesting course, had a variety of textures and tastes within it, which I mostly enjoyed. The shaved truffle overwhelmed the dish though, and we just had an amuse bouche with strong truffle flavor. I don't care how fancy it is, two strong truffle dishes in one sitting is too much.\n\n4th course - grilled beef, kohlrabi, brussels sprouts, chrysanthemum, XO sauce - this was the best. The beef was perfect, warm red throughout. Delicious\n\n5th course - coconut sorbet, lime granita, chili meringue - I was hoping for their celery sorbet because that was fantastic, but this was not pleasing to palette.\n\n6th course - honey cardamom mousse, almond nougat, coffee ice cream, chocolate soil - I don't like coffee so I was SOL with this dish. chocolate soil was okay though\n\nextra dessert - 3 chocolate-like treats each. I don't like marshmallow or peanut butter, which was 2/3 treats (I understand this is just my taste, not factored into review).\n\nAnd unlike the previous two times, the waitstaff was cold. Different wait persons were bringing our meals/wine all night, we got poured the wrong wine at one time, they kept pouring sparkling water in my still water glass, though clarifying I had still at least 3 times. The last two times I came to commonwealth, we would get extra wine here or there if we really liked it, but this was very in and out with dropping dishes and wine, no personal touch.\n\nThe real reason it has 2 stars though - for the two of us, the total with tip came to $430. $215 each is a ridiculous amount of money for anything less than top 10 food or service. Unfortunately I think my 3rd trip will be my last time bringing people here, too many other good restaurants in San Francisco to give this place another try.", "author": "Sarah B."}

I've walked by Commonwealth quite a few times but never noticed an entrance for the place, which can be found tucked away around the corner. Walking through the door of Commonwealth made me feel like an \"in the know\" VIP. Always a good feeling.\n\nThe inside of Commonwealth is light and spacious, the space itself is fairly small though. I didn't particularly like the seating arrangements as I felt that our table was too close to our neighbors. Maybe I'm part paranoid of eavesdropping neighbors and part guilty of being one but I found it to be too close for comfort to part take in conversation.\n\nThe hostess was warm and friendly but unfortunately, our waitress was a little lukewarm to us. I had a feeling she didn't care for us too much.. maybe because we looked younger than the rest of the crowd? Not sure. But I can't help that, I blame my Asian genes.\n\nOnto the most important part of the experience, the food. The food deserves 4 stars but the lukewarm service garnered only a 3 star Yelp review.\n\nWe started out with the complimentary homemade chips with nori powder-- which I just couldn't get enough of. It was served with some sort of foamy dip that I didn't quite get or cared for. I was happy munching the chips on its own.\n\nWe decided to share the small plates and started with the shishito peppers, goat cheese mousse, rose crispy rabbit rillettes, brik pastry, peach mostarda.\nI wasn't exactly a fan of the rabbit rillettes but I loved the shishito peppers. It was an interesting mix with the goat cheese.\n\nFor entrees, we had the halibut poached in coconut milk, potato, little gems, padron peppers, rose geranium grilled beef heart, sprouting broccoli, daikon radish, ramps, black garlic, kimchee. The halibut is so good and so soft that it reminded us of the texture of crab.\n\nEverything was delicious, but I especially loved the halibut and the beef hearts. The halibut was surprising very well portioned. I was impressed that I walked out feeling very satisfied with no late night in-and-out run needed.\n\nI would love to come back to Commonwealth and try their tasting menu but what I'd love more is to receive warmer service from the servers.", "author": "Tiffany U."}

Not only was the vegetarian tasting menu relatively affordable ($84 for 7 courses // + 1 bonus), the ambiance was laid back and the decor was super tasteful, and the wait staff was truly phenomenal.

With short notice we made a reservation for 9:15 pm on Saturday (it was that or 5:15 pm).  We arrived about an hour early intending to have a drink or two at the bar before being seated.  Upon walking in the door we saw that there was no seating available at the bar and so figured we'd go to another cocktail lounge in the area to before our reservation.  The hostess caught us as we were walking out the door and asked if she could offer any assistance.  We explained the situation to her, and she responded that they could seat us right now if we'd like.  That was agreeable with us and so we were seated.  \n\nWe had looked over the menu before arriving and had decided we were going to go with the tasting menu.  On a side note, part way though dinner a new table sat next to us and proceeded to create their own tasting menu by selecting different items off the menu and having the kitchen split them up.   This was accommodated without issue from the restaurant.  (big plus in our book)\n  To begin, kitchen sent out a bowl of house made potato chips dusted with seaweed powder.  The chips were delicious, very fresh and lightly salted.  The seaweed powder added a nice savoriness.  Next up was the amuse-bouche which was a single muscle poached in a broth. It was a nice and pleasant way to start into dinner.  The main courses of dinner as as follows with the wine pairing beneath. \n\n*brandade, coastal succulents, meyer lemon, wild flowers, chilled pea soup\nTREIXADURA ,  Vi\u00f1a Mein  ,  Ribeiro ,  '12  Galicia, Spain\n^First course was nice, the chilled pea soup was very flavorful. \n\n*scallop, hearts of palm, popcorn puree, pea greens, yuzu kosho milk\nCHARDONNAY  ,  Copain ,  Tous Ensembles  ,  '12  Anderson Valley, Ca\n^My favorite course of the evening, quite possibly the most succulent buttery perfectly cooked scallop I have ever eaten. \n\n*stonefruit, cucumber, chrysanthemum, nasturtium, puffed rice, almond & sake lees\nGR\u00dcNER VELTLINER  ,  Johann Donabaum  , '12  Wachau, Austria\n^Another winner.  The combination of perfectly ripe peaches and plums, the contrast of the crisp puffed rice and rich almonds. \n\n*sweetbreads poached in beeswax, corn pudding, black truffle, honey\nSANGIOVESE ,  Il Borghetto  ,  Montigiano  ,  '10  Tuscany, Italy\nI'm not a huge sweetbreads fan, this was just okay.  \n \n*celery sorbet, verjus soda\n^Wow...this sorbet captured the essence of celery.  It was beautiful, clean and perfectly balanced. \n\n*beer meringue, chocolate ganache, pretzel crumble, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream\nBRACHETTO  ,  Malabaila di Canale  ,  Birb\u00e9t  ,  Piedmont, Italy\n^A nice finish to the evening, the meringue, ganache and pretzel all worked really well together (Almost tasting \"smores\" like). The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, was good though I would of liked a little more \"tang\" to it.  It was mostly just smooth and creamy.  This wine was by far the standout of the evening, slightly sweet with hints of strawberry, a beautiful contrast to the rest of the course. \n\nIn the end this was a nice meal, not the best I have ever had, but solid.  Some of the courses could of been a little stronger, similarly the most of the wines in the pairing were very \"soft\", in some ways that lets the food shine through, but in others they were so soft that I didn't feel they added anything to the course.    Service was excellent though, as was the ambiance.  It's a great spot for a romantic dinner. \n\nWe also very much appreciate that Commonwealth donates $10 from each menu to Breakthrough SF.

I started off this meal with a glass of Cava - it was perfect, not too dry and not too sweet.  The menu has been mentioned by many others so I won't repeat it here but I will say it is heavy on really fresh vegetables and their desserts really shine.  Given that my friend is pretty much a carnivore, I was pleased to know that she enjoyed this meal.\n\nThere seems to be a trend lately of restaurants offering tasting menus with anywhere from 5 courses to 20+.  However, I'm discovering that a greater number of courses does not necessarily equate with satiety.  Upon first glance I thought that would be an issue here as well, but that simply was not the case.  I was completely satisfied.  The carrot and radish salad, venison (with a delicious sauce) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=wXF5clKIOIJKMVo45y_-1g), blood orange sorbet with Chantilly cream and the peanut butter semifreddo with salted caramel sauce were the dishes that stood out to me, but I did enjoy all the dishes.\n\nService was attentive and unobtrusive.  Each dish arrived with an explanation of the components.   Napkins were folded whenever a diner left the table.  Water glasses were replenished without asking.  Much care was taken with every detail, with the food and the service.   The best parts of formal dining were present, but in a less formal setting - the best of both worlds!\n\nIn terms of the setting, tables are placed rather closely to one another.  A small number of seats are available at the bar, overlooking the kitchen.  It can get fairly noisy inside but isn't wasn't so loud that diners needed to shout to be heard.  The ambiance is definitely upscale hipster, but patrons young and old(er) were present on my visit.  A huge plus is that they donate a portion of their sales to charity.", "author": "Melissa L."}

Pricing is reasonable at $80 + $50 for a 6 courses + pairing. \nWe were kind of concerned at first because it requires the participation of the whole table, and there were several items in the tasting menu my wife wasn't very fond of - while in the meantime the dishes I was attracted to were not available a la carte. \nBut they were really open to substitutions in the tasting menu.\n\n\nI enjoyed every dishes, but some were more memorable than others: \n- the mise en bouche - a soft taco which a gazillion of elements I didn't all catch - was forgettable: the taco itself had an overwhelming taste from the flour used.\n- the poached oyster was amazing: it tasted like a fresh one, and even my wife who doesn't usually like oyster enjoyed it. \n- the abalone was a disappointment: the dish itself was good, but we could barely taste the abalone\n- the truffle artichoke was my favorite. \n- the venaison was well cooked, tender. Presentation could have been slightly better with the sauce in a sauciere, but it was a solid dish. My wife got the hen, pretty good too but maybe less spectacular. \n- the celery ice cream was a perfect bridge between the entree and the dessert. Our less brave friends chose a blood orange sorbet instead, but I will definitely vouch for the celery- if you like celery of course. \n- the dessert was a big success - except for me. I am not a big chocolate fan, so the soft meringue, chocolate cake and coconut ice cream fell a bit flat to me. It was good of course, but not overly original. I think it was advertised to be a \"beer meringue\", but didn't taste like beer at all.  \n- the sweets at the end were ok. The marshmallows were of no use, but the kind of nougatine was pretty good. \n\nPairing was interesting and pretty generous. Lot of new world wines. The price was reasonable. \n \nService was pretty good. There was a long wait before the venison, but they apologized and we were having a good time so we didn't mind.\n\nOverall, we liked Commonwealth. It's a 3.5 stars to me, which I eventually rounded up because the price was right.", "author": "Lionel F."}

The first three courses were light and refreshing so you won't be too stuffed comes the meat course. \n\nCommonwealth also is very flexible with their menu.  If you see sth you like in the a la carte you can substitute with the dish in the tasting menu or add on.

The entrance is on the side with a little low-key sign, pretty easy to miss. We didn't drive, but there's a parking lot next to it--but it was already packed even before the restaurant opens, so don't count on it...?\n\nWe all ordered tasting menu, but the a la carte all look amazing too. Commonwealth is flexible so you can ask them to change some dishes in the tasting menu if you don't like certain things. The \"replacement\" is as good as the intended dish! \n\nFor drinks, we ordered house-made soda and a cocktail. Both drinks are amazing! The cocktail is very cool, made with liquid nitrogen, unfortunately I didn't ordered it so I don't remember the name of it :P The seaweed chips with foamy vinegar is pretty cool.  \n\nThe food is indeed different from what I usually have. Full with unique flavors--to be honest, some are hard to pin down if I like them or not, but definitely not hate! Usually the flavor are on the sour, refreshing and lighter side. A lot of things are very creative and unheard of! A lot of greens, raw, flowers, and grassy tastes. Nothing heavy. \n\nThe plating is a piece of art! Indeed something you instagram on! ;) Our main dish(?) is a perfectly seared, big, juicy scallop with popcorn flavor sauce. Also the sweetbread--we didn't know it is a culinary term! We thought it is literally \"sweet bread\", especially it is cooked in beewax, sounds like a delicious dessert or pastry, right? We googled it on the table, of course, and also found out sweetmeat means candy. The celery sorbet is definitely the highlight! The dessert is delicious too.\n\nThe portion are small, but we actually get full in the end. (For girls, anyways) \n\nTook a bit longer, especially in the end--I think it is better if they can be consistent a little for each dish's waiting time. Bring good company so you can share the surprises and admire the beautiful plate of food! :D\nOverall a good meal with many surprises!", "author": "Ya K."}

I was expecting the food to be all looks but not much taste, but it was not the case! I really enjoyed the artful presentation and the subtle but complex flavors, and kept looking forward to the next course. I even left with a pretty full stomach.\n\nCelery root soup with apples and horseradish - Yum!! Creamy and the celery flavor wasn't too strong. Apple bits were really tangy and the horseradish added slight spicyness. Served in a small cute mug.\n\nPoached oysters, asian pear, horseradish, sorrel, finger lime - Light, citrusy, and refreshing. The foamy balls of horseradish were neat. I didn't eat the sorrel after noticing it tasted like tree leaves (I don't understand herbs sometimes).\n\nDungeness crab, sea urchin, buddha's hand kosho, sea grape, shellfish custard - A really light, flavorful & interesting soup that I wish I could have had more of. After a traumatic uni experience a month ago, I was apprehensive about having it again, but it was good! (and not fishy.)\n\nFromage blanc, pomegranate, walnut, chicories, persimmon leather - A salad that I wasn't too fond of...besides the pomegranate and chewy persimmon leather, it was mostly bitter, and the licorice flavor was very strong. And the walnut powder was weird.\n\nAmerican wagyu beef, grilled onions, kale, parsnip, black truffle jus - It was nice to finally have a warm, 'umami' dish! The previous appetizers succeeded in making me really hungry. The black truffle jus was amazing...I was going to eat the rest with a spoon, but I didn't have one. =(\n\nCelery sorbet - Really cool and a good palate cleanser but it tasted literally like pure, concentrated celery juice.\n\nBeer meringue, chocolate ganache, pretzel crumble, creme fraiche ice cream - OMG this dessert was pure heaven and so texture-ful...you need some. \"Pretzel crumble\" sounded questionable, but it's actually just like brown sugar crumble, except with pretzel bits in it so it adds a tiny bit of saltiness. LOVED THIS DESSERT! I also loved the sparkling red dessert wine it was paired with (Brachetto).\n\nThe restaurant is a lot smaller than I expected (but has a tasteful, modern interior), and lighting is pretty dim.

Their mission is to provide inventive high-end cuisine at a much lower price than you'd expect while still siphoning off a percentage of every mail for local charities/non-profits.  \n\nWith respect to their mission, I would say they largely succeed.  Each dish there is a small feat in complex molecular gastronomy, like a piece of artwork in your mouth.  The inventions are not for the faint of heart, they demand attention and engagement with each bite.  \n\nService is quite good and the ambience warm with soft light painting a small open main room.  Overall, they do quite a good job and take pride in what they offer with pretension.\n\nIf this is your type of food, then you'll be really pleased.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-26", "description": "I was so impressed by Commonwealth, and yet for some reason I'm not super jazzed to potentially go back....which is why this is a four and not a five star review.\n\nMy friend and I had dinner here two weekends ago and opted for the tasting menu.  We started the meal with a \"free\" serving of nori chips with a vinegar mousse (they call it a foam, but it's more substantial), which I absolutely loved - what a fun play on British \"chips!\"  I would recommend eating them quickly, as the mousse deteriorates over the course of the meal....  On our tasting menu, we had some type of starter that involved fish roe, a beet salad with thinly sliced beef (I think), an amazing beef main course, a celery sorbet, and a beer meringue dessert.  I'm forgetting at least one course and failing to describe the others adequately...I wish I had saved the menu.\n\nAnyway, I loved every course.  I mean, really, it was all excellent.  And we both agreed that this is pretty rare for a tasting menu - there's generally one or two things that don't float your boat.  I was particularly impressed by the meats - everything was incredibly tender and well-cooked. This place is definitely super foodie, but they don't seem to sacrifice the basics and mask them with fancy add-ons.  I also LOVED the palate-cleansing sorbet and the dessert.  The celery sorbet is served with a verjus soda, giving it a bubbly, tangy quality.  SO MUCH BETTER than a traditional citrus palate cleanser.  The dessert was INSANELY good.  It didn't actually sound very appealing to me - I thought it was going to be super heavy (beer meringue, chocolate ganache, pretzel crumble, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream), but it wasn't.  Instead, it tasted exactly like a deconstructed, gourmet s'more.  I was practically licking the plate.\n\nSo why do I not feel enthused about potentially coming back here in the future?  Although we had an 8pm dinner reservation on a Friday, and the restaurant appeared to be totally booked up until around 10pm, the restaurant was half empty.  It was also dark and everyone that was working was sort of somber.  So, the whole place felt very low energy.  Adding to that feeling was the extremely slow pacing of the dishes.  We were there for over 2 hours and sat around for at least 20 minutes between courses - so it was a fairly exhausting dinner.  \n\nIf they could maybe brighten it up / lighten the mood, I think I'd be more inclined to go back, as the food truly is tremendous.", "author": "Tay H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-29", "description": "Commonwealth is one of those restaurants where you have high expectations just from the mere fact that it was a semi-finalist for a James Beard award. You expect the space to be sleek and modern, the food to be miniature pieces of art, and your taste buds to be satisfied. I'm beginning to think that I'm not a fan of progressive American cuisine. Some of the food here was reminiscent of WD~50 in New York. The use of molecular gastronomy and innovative cooking styles showcased the techniques, but not the food. Plating made the food look nice and pretty, but that's it.  Yes, I was impressed by the aesthetics, but why can't I also enjoy the flavors?\n\nWe opted for dining a la carte because the items on the tasting menu were slightly smaller than the a la carte and two of the six courses were dessert. The only thing that I wanted to try on the tasting menu was the foie gras, but unfortunately the chef couldn't accommodate our request to try it a la carte. Dinner started off with kombu dusted potato chips with a side malt vinegar espuma. It was less foamy and more of a thick emulsion. For appetizers, we started with the arancini and the sea urchin. The arancini were good, but I could hardly taste the truffle cheese. The sea urchin was the best dish I had all night. The ginger, kimchee, tapioca, and cauliflower all highlighted the sea urchin. It tasted fresh and I liked the crunch from the seaweed brioche underneath. \n\nFor entrees, we had the beef cheeks and the pork loin and belly. The dish had no sauce, and made even more disappointing by the meager portions. The cheeks themselves were cooked well, but it didn't taste cohesive with anything else on the plate. I could also probably find the same beef cheeks at any decent Chinese restaurant. The most interesting thing on the plate was the salsify cromesquis, which were tiny croquettes filled with sauce. Maybe the sauce was intended for the rest of the plate, but there were only two and they ended up exploding in my mouth. The pork loin and belly was sauced well, but I didn't enjoy the dry loin or the fatty belly. Again, there was nothing special about the protein, with the rest of the dish being slightly better than what came with the beef cheeks.\n\nOur meal came out to be a little over $50 for two people, which isn't too bad, but considering the amount of food we were served, I would not have been happy had I been hungry beforehand. With our meal being a la carte, our meal was also one of the fastest I've ever had - I think we finished in around half an hour.

Tucked in the iffy Mission District (although locals consider this a cool neighborhood, I thought it was a bit sketchy) Commonwealth has a parking lot for guests ($5 but it's hard to park in this area) and it's a calming gray storefront, compared to the colorful tagging found in much of this neighborhood.\n\nMy husband and I chose to do the summer tasting menu and the server was nice enough to let us swap out a couple things that weren't there, but we really wanted to try them from the regular menu. I thought this was great. Most tasting menus are very strict and I was glad that I got my first taste of geo duck and sea urchin into this meal!\n\nThe amuse bouche was a tasty little mussel with bone marrow powder in a bite-sized cracker, resembling a mussel shell. Super cool and delicious.\n\nThe first course was an albacore tuna dish with fresh melon. Together, so lovely and refreshing. The plate was fresh and very tasty. There ware also pieces of lardo curled on the plate, which when all combined really kicked up the flavor of the tuna. Loved it!\n\nOur second course were the scallops, served with a popcorn puree (literally tasted like butter, mmmmmmm) and yuzo foam. Also quite a light and refreshing dish. Off to a good start!\n\nOur third course was where we switched out the radish salad for geo duck and uni. From witnessing the radish salad, I think we made a good choice. The sea urchin was hearty portion, delicate and flavorful. The geo duck, I just loved. The texture was fresh and chewy and of a delectable clam. YUM!\n\nOur next dish was the lamb sweetbread and my least favorite. Slightly greasy, I prefer my sweetbreads a tiny bit crunchy and less soft. If you like lamb, it definitely had the strong gamey flavor of lamb.\n\nThe first dessert was a palate cleanser of grape sorbet with a lemon poppyseed meringue. It was pleasant.\n\nThe second dessert was insanely awesome and I'm not much of a dessert eater. It was a chocolate genache with a peanut butter mousse and frozen popcorn (think frozen butter). Heavenly, but rich...definitely filled up any remaining room I had left in my tummy.\n\nThis place is very good and fairly priced.

The protein course was a bland and unimaginative slice of pork shoulder presented to me on a silly granite cube. My wife and I chose the accompanying wine pairings which brought our total bill for two with gratuity to over $300.

In fact, I avoid the Mission like the pest (apart from Foreign Cinema)... too much gentrification, too many new boutique-style restaurants that don't hold.\n\nHaving said that, friends recommended the place.\nIn my opinion, the best way to experience Commonwealth and the thought behind this concept, is to get the Taster Menu. The wine-pairing is wonderful and works well with the food. It reminds me of a few places in London and Berlin that I've visited.\nThe sommelier was very generous with the wine, which is always appreciated.\n\nAnd, as a nice bonus, they donate a good amount of money to local charities, so your food is also doing some good.", "author": "Joe G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-30", "description": "Commonwealth is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. This restaurant really pushes the envelope in creating beautiful, artful yet tasty plates. I really like their progressive approach to American cuisine - they use a layered approach to its ingredients and preparation, where there is usually no focal ingredient to the dish and all the ingredients in a particular dish have different modes of preparation. As a result, each dish is composed almost like artwork as each additional layer of food is delicately applied to the plate.. \n\nThey offer a la carte menu (prices between $11 and $18) or a tasting menu ($75), which I think is reasonable pricing for a restaurant of this caliber. In addition, Commonwealth contributes back to the local community through charitable donations whenever a diner chooses the tasting menu: $10 of the $75 is donated to a local charity. Commonwealth has a large bar seating area where they take walk-ins in case you are not able to secure a reservation.", "author": "Kai C."}

We arrived 15 minutes early and sure enough, were told our table would be ready AT 8p.\n\nOnce we were seated we were a server immediately came over, introduced herself and told us about the menu. We weren't sure if we were going to do A La Carte, or the 6 course meal with wine pairing and she suggested to do the 6 courses and wine pairing. We didn't feel like it was so she could receive a larger tip, only because she wanted us to enjoy the evening and the food, so we went with that.\n\nWe were happy with our service and overall the meal and the wine pairings. We were far from blown away, but the experience was amazing. The owner was the one serving the wine to us (we found that out later by our server) and each course was paired very well with the wine. The atmosphere was very nice. The tables are a little close together and it's a pretty small restaurant, but we didn't feel crowded. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend checking this place out. If you can afford to do the 6 courses and wine pairing, do it, if you're just looking for a great meal and a great experience, go A La Carte.", "author": "Vina T."}

You learn something new everyday!) \n\nThe menu isn't extensive but it's thoughtful enough to accommodate both vegetarians and meat eaters. I was excited to see Idiazabal cheese on one of the salads so I had to get that. The asian pear, chicories and cured ham salad were dotted with little purses of cheese which had the consistency of smooth cream. It was delish! My BFF enjoyed his shaved carrot and radishes salad with quinoa and ash coated goat cheese. This was presented beautifully on a (granite?) slab. \n\nThe scallop crudo was very fresh with grapefruit segments and celery root sauce. Tiny portion so I wouldn't advise to share.\n\nMy grilled lamb cheeks were cooked to perfection.  It was adorned with cauliflower, douglas fir and almond crumble which somehow went together. But I was annoyed about the DEHYDRATED chanterelles on top.  How can you ruin such a wonderful fungi! (okay, so maybe I am a foodie after all, I just defended mushrooms!)\n\nThe chicken quenelles were just plain weird. They basically took poached chicken, PUREED it, blended this with egg and vanilla cream (thank you Sara for the explanation) But next time I want to eat baby food, I'll make it at home, thank you. \n\nThe prices are reasonable for the \"molecular gastronomy\" you get, but these with 3 drinks, our meal still hit the triple digits and frankly, that's not very affordable especially if the portions are SMALL. \n\nOn a side note, our server was knowledgeable and gracious (she offered to give us another dish in exchange for the chicken one) but at this point, all we wanted to do was get out of there and go to NOPA to satiate our hungry tummies. Yeah I said it, shamelessly plugging NOPA right here on Commonwealth's page!", "author": "Janice C."}

Having said that, my friend and I were actually disappointed because none of the dishes were amazing and we felt that the wow factor was missing from the entire meal.  \n\nWe ordered 5 dishes between the two of us, plus a dessert.  We chose:\n\n- green strawberries, fennel, goat cheese, bee and fennel pollen, mizuna, black radish  13\n- charred scallop ceviche, carrot-soy panna cotta, yuzu, crispy onion rings, mint  15\n-asparagus and sunflower seed risotto, shiitakes, preserved lemon, chicken skin crisp 14\n- tea smoked duck, sprouted wheatberries, burnt tangerine, crispy duck tongues  16\n- braised short rib, ramps, raw and cooked lettuces, cauliflower, kimchee, walnut jus  15\n\nAgain, while everything was complex in its construction, and it was definitely very thoughtfully assembled, we felt that there was something missing in almost all of them to bring the tastes together.  In fact, we both thought some of the dishes were a bit bland! (and neither of us are big on salt).  The kimchee on the short rib was probably the highlight from a taste standpoint.   \n\nI contrast this experience to Sons and Daughters, or Atelier Crenn, where the creativity leads to some amazing combinations, and you finish the meal really excited about some of the dishes you've just experienced. \n\nTo end our meal, we ordered the strawberries with pistachio ice cream for dessert, and a couple of glasses of wine each, for a total of about $65 apiece before tip.   \n\nMaybe it was just an off night and the salt shaker went missing.", "author": "Vivian W."}

And boy was I impressed...\n\nWe opted for the $75 tasting menu ($120 with wine pairings but we all had busy work days the next day and weren't feeling in the mood to be hungover so we just ordered a glass of wine each) and tried 6 different courses to get the full experience. I highly recommend choosing this option so you can really see the unique and intricate details in the dishes the chef clearly loves. The portion sizes are just right without making you feel bloated or leaving you feeling empty and ripped off. I remember absolutely loving the lamb and asian pear courses! Also, the desserts were outstanding! \n\nThe ingredients are high quality and seasonal with an emphasis on vegetables. Normally, that would entice me to run in the opposite direction but I'm pleased to say that the vegetables were actually delicious and definitely added to the uniqueness of each item. \n\nThe ambiance is understated classy with dim lighting and an open kitchen.

We got our reservation for a group of 4, a month in advance. \n\nI arrived a bit early, and sat at the bar for a drink. I think I would've liked the bar dining experience here. The bartender is pretty friendly, and you can look into the kitchen. \n\nWe could take our table when we were ready, no need to wait for the entire party, which I really liked! \n\nDrinks- beer and wine only. We ordered a glass each, but I think going with a bottle would've been a better bet. Though everyone ordered something different so it might be hard to pair it. \n\nAppetizers- we ordered the much talked about sea urchin to share. I must say, there's a lot of different tastes wrapped into this one dish. It's a tiny dish, so I recommend ordering 1 for 2 people or 1 for 1. \n\nEntrees- I'm a light eater (very light according to the server who kept wanting us to order more). We each got 2 dishes per person, I really don't recommend three. I ate the chanterelle mushrooms, parsley and whey bread, fermented turnips, cured egg yolk  first. I really liked this. I've never seen a egg like that, it was like a jelly. And the bread was green! For my 2nd dish, I got the Butternut Squash dish (I can't find this on the online menu so can't provide the exact dish). I think the only thing I really liked in the second one was the butternut squash (so I remember it), the rest of it was okay. My friend who got the hen felt the same way, he said it was \"common place\", not unique. \n\nService- host and bartender aside, the service was bad. I HATE servers that order-shame you. Our server kept making a face, since he didn't think we were ordering enough. I wanted to have one dish and then dessert, and he was like oh trust me, you need two dishes. And then I said no, I'm good, and he said it again, that you will need more. So I ordered two, and half way through 2, I was wayy too full. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy dish #2, and I had no room for dessert. I can't believe he was suggesting 3 dishes per person when we first sat down. Also, he wasn't okay with us ordering more later if we have room for more. And he shook his head when we spilt the bill between couple of cards. Like c'mon! The machine can do with one card what it can do with more. \n\nI understand that it's a \"fancy\" restaurant, but this is why some of the other places like State Bird are doing so much better, the service at these other places is phenomenal. Even if the food is mediocre, the service is what makes the place. My minus two points is for the service.", "author": "Anoo L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-14", "description": "FOAM PARTY ANYONE?\n\nCommonwealth seems to take foaming to a whole different level, they put foam on almost everything! They must make it by the tons, enough to throw a foam party after-hours. And, if I didn't know any better, I would have thought that Top Chef's villainous Marcel Vigneron was Chef/Owner of Commonwealth. All you Top Chef Fans should know what I'm talking about...\n\nOn Sunday, 9.5.10, my friend and I were promptly seated for our 5:30 PM reservations.\n \nFOOD:\nCommonwealth offers a $60 Chef's Tasting Menu; $10 is donated to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (full participation needed by entire party). \n\nWe opted to order from the a la carte menu (2-3 dishes are recommended per person).\n\n*Complimentary Housemade Chips w/ Vinegar Foam: GOOD! The chips were light and very crisp (think Kettle Chips). It was lightly dusted w/ nori which added a salty and slightly smokey flavor. The accompanying foam vinegar was tangy, sweet, and sour which helped balanced some of the oiliness from the chips.  \n\n*Crispy Pig Ears ($6): YUM! The freshly fried CPE were warm, salty, savory, and very crunchy. I thought it would have had a chewy texture from the cartilage, but most of the pieces didn't. If you like chicharrones, you will enjoy the CPE. It was a bit rich for me, so I used the vinegar foam from the chips to balance out the flavors.\n\n*Compressed Watermelon Salad ($11): GOOD! This is the perfect summer salad; the tri-color watermelons were sweet and juicy, the wild greens were crisp and peppery, and the nori candy crisp added a sweet crunch and nutty flavor. However, I wasn't very fond of all the arugula used b/c it had a strong peppery flavor which overpowered the watermelons. There was also an accompanying foam which was very bland and tasted like beaten egg whites.\n\n*Corn Custard w/ Sea Urchin ($15):  Just OK! Although the dish is a good concept, it wasn't executed properly.  The highlight of the dish was definitely the fresh sea urchin which was thick and rich w/ a slight brininess. However, I expected the custard to be velvety and smooth; instead it had the texture of a semi-firm tofu. There were way too many corn kernels that were clumped together and the chorizo was burnt to a crisp and didn't add much flavor to it. The lobster emulsion was a bland and again tasteless foam was added.\n\n*Marrow Stuffed Squid ($13): GOOD! The squid was perfectly grilled and tender. The black garlic and cilantro added a nice salty garlicky kick w/ a pop of freshness. However, the term \"marrow stuffed\" is a bit misleading b/c the squid was filled w/ a pork sausage mixture w/ very little marrow in it. Although, the pork was well-seasoned, the saltiness subdued any remnants of bone marrow.\n\n*Butter Poached Black Cod ($14): YUMMY! I rarely order cooked fish at restaurants b/c most places tend to overcook it. However, based on all the good reviews, I knew I had to try the black cod. The flesh of the cod was very soft and delicate and flaked off w/ the gently swipe of my fork. The skin was light and crisp which added a nice texture contrast. The lemon confit complemented the cod by adding a nice citrus punch. But, I wasn't a fan of the cauliflower b/c although it was crispy, it was burnt to a black char. Yet again, bland foam topped the cod.\n\n*Cinnamon Mille Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache and Burnt Honey Ice Cream ($8):  DELISH! A nice take on a deconstructed smores! The Cinnamon Mille Feuille was like a crisp, buttery and flakey piece of phyllo dough, the marshmallow was warm, soft, and ooey goeey w/ a touch of earthy spice from the cardamom, the ganache like the center of a rich decadent truffle, and the burnt honey ice cream was rich, creamy, and sweet (similar to a light caramel). Together, it was perfect combo of various flavors, textures, and temperatures.\n\nSERIVICE:\nVery friendly and down-to-earth. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, took our orders promptly, and checked on us several times to make sure everything was ok. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nDisplaying a funky mural of Hunt's Quality Donuts, you wouldn't think Commonwealth would be a contemporary establishment. For those who have been to Bar Tartine, the ambiance and d\u00e9cor of Commonwealth is very reminiscent of its clean and sleekness; light oak tables, white brick walls, honeycomb paintings, and bar seating.\n\nThere's table seating for about 35 which is cramped and seating at the bar for 10 which is even tighter. \n\nPARKING:\nCommonwealth has their own private lot which has 8 spaces, however, it's $5 for parking. I personally rather pay the $5 then have to circle around and around looking for street parking.\n\nOverall, I can't see eye-to-eye with the 5 Star reviews. Many of the dishes are a great concept in theory, but don't meet the mark in terms of the flavors and textures combos (esp the FOAM), so 3 Stars for the food. An extra Star goes to Commonwealth's charitable efforts!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

At $60 for 6 courses and another $30 for wine, I was all over it. On top of that they donate $10 from the menu to the SF Food Bank. Each month they will try and choose another charity to donate to. That's highly respectable.  \n\nAfter sitting down you are set up with a bowl of homemade chips and a vinegar foam/espuma and complimentary still or sparkling water.

I loved the crispyness of the potato chips, but the malt vinegar dressing was too overpowering and I didn't think they really needed to have it.\n-Apple, Lard, Chicory, Beer and Cheddar Cream, Rosemary Cracker, Pickled Mustard Seed ($12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#_-tU4lxPZ0U3WVWXJGXnFA): Just ok. There wasn't much lard present, whcih is why we ordered the dish to begin with, and I didn't think the components worked that well together. The rosemary crackers really threw me off. Skip!\n-Sea Urchin, Trout Roe, Potato, Gem Lettuce, Lime Cream, Pickled Wasabi Leaf (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#JZeG0RbNhMSN7oKt08vWuQ, $16): Delicious! Also on the 2013 7x7 list, deservedly. The sea urchin was super fresh, and went well with all the other ingredients. Highly recommended!\n-Beets in Different Textures, Fromage Blanc, Pumpernickel, Sorrel, Smokey Hay Oil (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#2gAgAqpi4bfsITlwg3AI_Q, $13): I enjoyed this dish, but the beets weren't quite as tender as I'd like. \n-Pumpkin, Slow Cooked Egg, Crispy Kale, Quinoa, Brown Butter, Walnut Miso (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#Po8AQpc91CdB0ZhOqdirBw, $14): Just ok. The miso flavor overpowered everything else, and I thought the texture of the quinoa and slow cooked egg clashed. Not my favorite dish.\n-Grilled Lamb Breast, Dates, Chard, Pine Nut Panna Cotta, Cauliflower (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#1dOJUC3vIVe0oWfUW3RY4w, $16): SOOOO good- a must order! The lamb breast was amazingly tender and the pine nut panna cotta was wonderful. \n-Corned Beef Tongue, Brussel Sprouts, White Bean, Rye Cracker, Quail Egg, Scallop Emulsion (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#7Qi1XwgMdVE0sffrW_gmhQ, $14): Just ok. The beef tongue had a very mild flavor, and nothing on this plate really stood out.\n-Ginger Cake, Pumpkin Custard, Candied Pecans, Blueberry Sauce, Frozen Maple Syrup Mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/commonwealth-san-francisco?select=tg4apzr7daR4gbX7K3D_CA#ufccOI-TvIR3LSYB905haA): Good, but not spectacular. However, this was the only dessert that looked good to me from the menu.\n\nThe pace of dinner could have gone a little faster, but we didn't request our server to speed things up, so can't complain too much. However, the one big negative about dining at Commonwealth is that you will walk out smelling like food! The kitchen is completely open, and you can see what the chefs are doing if you have the right seat. The other negative is the tight seating- you can hear every word your dining neighbors are saying, despite your hardest efforts to try and tune them out. Thankfully, since the restaurant wasn't very full on a Monday night, we were lucky enough to have the tables next to us empty for most of our meal. Monday night is definitely the time to try and eat at Commonwealth, since they are booked solid most other nights when I've looked. Overall, I would recommend dining a la carte at Commonwealth so that you get to try more dishes, but make sure you wear clothes that don't need to be dry-cleaned! Parking can be difficult in this area (meters are now enforced M-Sun), but there should be ample spaces M-W nights. Just be careful walking around by yourself, especially if you're a woman!", "author": "Amy D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-02", "description": "I think my bottom line for this place may be 'less is more.' Now caveat is that this place is known more for their tasting menu and I was not in the mood for a lot of seafood so I ordered a la carte, so if I do make it back to try the tasting menu again my opinion may change.\n\nThe overall impression of all my dishes is that the individual pieces were well cooked, but I didn't feel that they came together well. \n\nIn comparing appetizers: the first dish was wild clams with seaweed, lime, and turnip. The clams were well cooked and refreshing but the combination cut away the original taste of the clam without adding much more in other flavors. The uni was well done, the popcorn was a surprise but in a good way.\n\nSecond dishes: I was looking forward to the charred cabbage but the sauce was extra creamy and made the dish heavier than I would have liked. Again I didn't get a sense of cohesion to the dish. The jerusalem artichoke as individual pieces was delicious (well cooked artichoke, delectable potatoes, and pickled onions but the truffle taste did not come through as much in the froth and was overpowering the subtle tastes of the remainder of the dish.\n\nEntrees: I was also of mixed opinion of the grilled pork. The pork was well-cooked, tender and juicy. It went well with the persimmon leather. However, the combination with maple syrup, rutabaga, and chicories made certain bites too bitter and sour and occasionally gave a ... for lack of a better way to describe it, potpourri taste.\n\nNow on the other hand, the duck breast was absolutely delicious to the last morsel. It was tender, juicy, well-seasoned, and the combination with celery root, kale, and gold rice was perfect. The dried autumn leaves added some texture, didn't necessarily make the dish but it didn't matter because I would order this again three times over.\n\nDesert: the brown butter cake with pears and ice cream was delicious, had the feel of bread pudding with great accents from the pear and a side of crunchy sweetness. \n\nOverall, a couple of great dishes but my taste buds were a bit overwhelmed by the multiple layers and I was looking more for a cohesion or theme the many of the dishes. Certainly inventive and unique, but not quite suited to my palate, Aside from the food, the decor was great. The inside glowed and was a pleasant surprise on a cold winter night.", "author": "Xtina W."}

Also the front door is nondescript, I was pretty close to just parking in front of it since I thought it was somewhere else.", "author": "Brian L."}

Bomb.\n\nI started with the grilled chicken dish which, surprisingly, came out as little meatballs.  Totally had the smokiness of the grill, but in bite-sized portions.  It whet my appetite for more.  And I couldn't wait to get to the entree.\n\nThe pork belly, as it always does at restaurants, immediately jumped out at me.  All of the little accompaniments with the dish delivered a surprise in every bite, and I loved it - picked mustard seeds, to boot.  \n\nWho doesn't love figs?  If you don't, you're an alien.  Fresh figs are the answer to every question in life, and not, \"Go to the mattresses.\"  I'll give you a dollar if you send me a compliment and tell me the original movie that line was from and the more recent flick that talked about it.  Anyway, we chose the fig leaf ice cream/fresh fig dessert- so delish in the fact that it wasn't overly sweet and the ice cream was obviously freshly prepared.  Lovely dish that complimented the meal fabulously.\n\nAnd on top of all of that, I enjoyed a nice Gamay that paired well with everything.   I'll totally be back for the $65 tasting menu/$105 with wine pairings.\n\nHINTS:\n- They have a parking lot, right alongside the building, but it's $5 to self-park and gets added to your bill (which is actually kinda nice).\n- A group of more than six would overpower the ambiance of this place.\n- The entrance is the door off of Mission along the parking lot side, and not actually ON Mission.\n- They recommend 3-4 dishes per person.

This is only restaurant I've been to that rivals Aziza's balance of craft, heart, and special energy.\n\nI grew up with a mom who would slice me 'Asian Pear' for dessert (we called them Korean Apple Pears, or Pe). Commonwealth's 'Asian Pear Salad' salad elevated this fruit to such a level that I felt a rush of emotions - especially joy - simply eating it. \n\nAs a vegetarian for over a decade, and having been to Millennium and Greens multiple times over the years, I can say that this is the best all-vegetarian menu (albeit tasting) I've had in this city.  Maybe it's just the menu they have right now - if so, Go.\n\nStandouts (if you're not doing the tasting menu, which you should):\nasian pear, sunflower seed granola, fermented apple, fromage blanc, honey\njerusalem artichoke, potato, charred and pickled onions, black truffle froth\nchanterelle mushroom, tapioca porridge, gem lettuce, ginger, cured egg yolk\n\nPlus, they donate $10 to the SF Food Bank for every tasting menu.

I'm there!  \n\nRESERVATIONS:\nMy friend made reservations for the two of us via opentable.com for Sunday, September 5 at 5:30pm.  Make sure you make reservations because walk-ins sit at the bar.  If you want a particular time, book as early as you can.  We booked almost a week beforehand and there was only early or late times available.\n\nMENU TIPS:\n*Dish sizes are small to medium\n*They recommend 2-3 dishes per person\n*Menu is divided by protein \n\nFOOD:\n*Complimentary still or sparkling water\n*Complimentary housemade potato chips with a vinegar sauce\n*$60 for tasting menu - the entire table has to participate though\n\n*Crispy Pig Ears, Carrot, Radish, Chili ($6) - Not bad.  I'll admit that I was a bit sketchy when my friend ordered pig ears, but it was deep fried and tasted like pork rinds.\n\n*Compressed Watermelon, Tofu, Nori, cucumber, Wild greens, Togarashi ($11) - The salad was okay.  Red and yellow pieces of watermelon are used as the base and wild greens and slices of cucumber placed on top.  Sprinkled on top is a hard sugar like nori component.  I'm not sure where the tofu was in this dish, but an odd, almost tangy white sauce/foam is placed around the dish.\n\n*Marrow stuffed squid, Tamarind Pork, Shelling Beans, Black Garlic, Cilantro ($13) - This was the dish I was looking forward to and although it was good, I felt that it didn't meet my expectations.  Two pieces of squid was stuffed with a tamarind pork and bone marrow mix and placed on top of shelling beans.  The marrow was not noticeable to me and I found the tamarind pork overwhelmed the entire dish, as that all you really tasted.\n\n*Young Hen and Spot Prawn, Spinach, Artichoke, Chocolate Almond Emulsion ($16) - YUM, the hen was AMAZING!!!  I've never had hen this tender!!  The spot prawns were a pass though, they were a bit on the soft and mushy side.  The spinach and artichoke was a nice compliment on the dish, but I wasn't a fan of the chocolate emulsion sauce. \n\n*Cinnamon mille-feuille, Cardamom Marshmellow, Chocolate Ganache, Burnt Honey Ice Cream ($8) -  YUM, a must order!  The lady at the table next to us called it a deconstructed s'more which I guess that's basically what it was with a side of honey ice cream.  The honey ice cream and the cinnamon mille-feuille were amazing and the two items of the dish that was a must try.  The chocolate ganache was good, but the marshmellow sprinkled with cardamom was the least enjoying part of the dish, as I'm not a fan of many spices.\n\nSERVICE:\nGood, our waitress was nice, helpful and explained the menu very well.  Our plates were taken away as soon as we were done to make room for the next dish.\n\nPARKING:\nA small, 9 car lot is located adjacent to Commonwealth meant for their customers only, however there are signs that there is a $5 fee to use their lot.  Since Commonwealth is located in the Mission, parking is a bit difficult and you're just paying for convenience.", "author": "Nicole S."}

We received two amuse before the menu started as well as some nibbles. We were stuffed by the end. \n\nThe staff were very friendly and even subbed one tasting menu item for us. That is super accommodating. They also brought our toddler a palate cleanser and dessert even though she was (obviously) not having the tasting menu. There's no kids' menu but they offered to alter menu items to make them work for our toddler (she loved the pork cheeks)! \n\n\u00c0 la carte is also available and also has delectable goodies.

All dishes of mine were beautiful, interesting and delicious.  My partner had 3 vegetarian dishes (carrots, garlic soup and asparagus), and he enjoyed them very much except asparagus which was not special.  Price was reasonable. The portion of each dish was quite small, which we like.  Dessert dishes were fantastic too.\n\nHostesses, servers, everyone was friendly, and our server was knowledgeable about food they serve and wine on the list.  His recommendation for wine and dessert wine were great.\n\nOnly negative experiences we had were that glasses of Champaign were flat and that we were about to be overcharged $80+.  A $20 glass of Champaign didn't have bubbles in it.  Either a bartender or our server could have noticed before we pointed out.  After we mentioned, they smoothly exchanged to the new ones, and they tasted good.  That was the beginning of the meal.

The difference is that it tastes better and is more \"normal\" than Atelier Crenn, at 1/4 the cost. We opted out of the $75 tasting menu and went a la carte to share 9 dishes between 3 people, and were comfortably full.

The only dish that needed a tweak was the celery root sorbet. Definitely tasty but the portion was probably 5 times larger than it should have been. Granted, I should have had the self-control to just stop eating but as my friends can attest to, if there's still delicious food left on the table, it is very difficult for me to not devour every last crumb, or in this case, drop.

I thought the malt sauce was very good, but it completely overpowered the seaweed dust on the chips\n\n2) Amuse: was an oyster, it was fantastic and got me very excited for the meal\n\n3) Smoked rainbow trout, trout roe, sea beans, horseradish-buttermilk snow: In all fairness I am not a smoked trout fan. The dish was ok in my opinion, the smokey flavor was overpowering the rest of the dish, but besides the smoked trout I liked the other components of the dish.\n\n4) Asparagus and eggs, sea urchin, egg mousse, herring roe, seaweed brioche: This dish was the highlight of the meal and the only dish I have continued to think about and would want again. I wanted to lick my bowl, the egg mousse was great. The texture of the sea urchin and brioche worked well together.\n\n5) Artichokes, candied citron, black olive, hazelnut pesto, goat's milk gel: This is where the meal started turning downhill for me. However, this was one of my mothers' favorite dishes. It was also a bit large in my opinion for a tasting menu. \n\n6) Lamb smoked over eucalyptus, fermented carrot, kale, yogurt: I love lamb and was underwhelmed by this dish. The eucalyptus flavor was quite strong. Perhaps it is that smoked issue again! The fermented carrot was not tasting at all to me. The kale also disappointed me, I love kale and cook it all the time, this one seemed sad, unseasoned and bland. \n\n7) Blood orange sorbet, tonka bean soda: Nice and refreshing after the strong eucalyptus flavor or fermented carrot from the dish before. \n\n8) Peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, frozen popcorn: Going into the meal this is probably the dish I was the most excited about. But again I left underwhelmed. It isn't bad, just not amazing. It is a really heavy dish and just a lot of chocolate. It was also hard to cut through to eat and you kind of made a scene trying to break into it with your fork. \n\nAs I said before it was a fun experience, but for the cost the food wasn't that memorable. The only dish I would want to come back and eat again was the sea urchin.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Still, it's nice that they have a $5 lot as a parking option. \n\nI had done the tasting menu before, but since we had 4 people, we decided to go with one of everything on the a la carte menu, so it was like a big tasting menu.  \n\n1. House made potato chips with nori and aioli: this was on the house, and they were a little too oily for me\n2. Fresh and pickled cucumbers with house whipped buttermilk, dill, and burnt avocado. The avocado was not ripe at all, which was disappointing, but the pickles were very refreshing\n3. Albacore crudo: I liked this a lot. The crudo was not too acidic, and it had lots of texture with coconut pearls and fermented carrot. I could have done without the crispy rice noodles, but they made for a nice presentation and some crunch\n4. Sea urchin: 4 pieces served with a beautifully green haricot vert veloute.  The fresh wasabi and horseradish tofu definitely gave it a kick, which was interesting\n5. Hay roasted carrots: with a hint of curry from the vadouvan. Curry carrots have been on a lot of menus lately, but their salted date ice cream coated in black and white sesame seeds definitely set the dish apart from the rest. Plus, I liked the nettles, which are hard to come by\n6. King trumpets: with a slow cooked egg, brown butter foam, and buckwheat crumble. I usually love anything with a runny egg and mushrooms.  There was a little too much foam for me, but this made a  nice, heartier vegetarian dish\n7. Fried anchovies: curled up with cured egg yolk, a baby tomato, and a bit of charred romaine. The fermented ramp aioli was a little strong for me, but the anchovy was less fishy than I expected\n8. Popcorn dumplings: soft, light dumplings and actual popcorn made for an interesting dish. The smoked corn silk broth was really good, but the dumplings were just ok \n9. Seared squid: the squid was stuffed, and it had a nice charred flavor on it. The squid ink kind of masked the shisito pepper relish, though\n10. Sablefish: I really liked this dish.  The sauce on it was so flavorful, and the fish was super tender.  The sunflower seeds added some crunch to it, and the honey poached radish added some spice and sweetness.  This was my favorite of the night. \n11. Young hen: very tender, and I loved the pea puree and onion jus.  There were a lot of grains on this dish, and I was happy to see fiddlehead ferns \n12. Smoked pork cheeks: flavorful, with an interesting peach mole, which had the traditional spice and seed flavor, but it was milder.\n13. Strawberries: fresh and pickled strawberries with fennel ice cream and pistachio flakes. I think I would have preferred a fennel sorbet since the rest of the ingredients are so much lighter?\n14. Beer meringue: the beer meringue part wasn't really a stand out, but the salted pretzel crumble was awesome with the creme fraiche ice cream. It also came with a square of chocolate ganache, which was a little out of place\n\nEach dish was complex with interesting ingredients that you wouldn't think would work, and yet they pull it off. My main complaint would be the portion sizes, but then again they're not really intended to be shared family style.  I like that they don't do the usual dishes that are overdone on so many other menus around SF.\n\nIn the end, with two bottles of red wine (a French pinot and another Italian red), the total came to $92 per person before tip, which was pretty cheap for what we got.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

Oats were kinda dry hard to chew, but that was the worst part of the entire meal.  I think they should have used something more crispy and light (like the toasted quinoa that came with the beet salad). Oyster with potatoes- think creamy goodness. Asparagus salad with trout roe was stunningly beautiful. Celery sorbet was so crisp and tangy. Chocolate ganache was a perfect close to the dinner. \nI will definitely come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-06", "description": "Commonwealth is a very intriguing restaurant on Mission Street.  It clearly represents the vanguard for gentrification, charging $80 for a six course tasting menu and a further $50 for wine accompaniment.  Molecular gastronomy is the order of the day, complete with smoking CO2 and plenty of foam.\n\nThe food is really quite good, although the courses all had a vague apple theme running through them, despite the fact that apples really aren't in season.  The first two dishes of oysters with yuzu and abalone shavings with mushrooms and peas (and the obligatory apple) were very good.  Artichokes on bread were well prepared, but not very memorable.  Likewise, the venison with tangerine and sweet potato were all perfectly prepared, but didn't really come together, even with the wine.  Fortunately, there were only two tiny pieces of meat, so no big deal.  Celery sorbet with acidified pear juice and the final porcini churro(!) with chocolate and pine mousse and cinnamon substitute (tonka bean) were both delicious in unexpected ways.  And surprisingly reminiscent of an apple.  \n\nOk, so I wasn't blown away by the food - it should still have been a 4 star experience.  However, the wine pours were extremely ungenerous and the food portions were minuscule.  I don't expect to leave restaurants like this feeling full.  I do expect to leave feeling like I won't need to eat again before I get to the house.  The service was to a generally high standard (with the notable exception of the wine pourer, who was more abstemious than a Scottish widow), but that didn't make me feel any less hungry at the end.  If you're the chef at this restaurant, trying to figure out how to address the many reviews that rave about the food, but complain about the portions, I have a suggestion: how about some Tartine bread?  Sure it will mess with the flavors a little, but it's a cheap way to correct all those 3 and 4 star reviews...\n\nUntil then, my verdict: for less money, go to Al's place and get similarly tasty and inventive food that's a little less molecular in size and preparation.", "author": "Roy A."}

We try to come here as often as we can, and their tasting menu never fails to disappoint. The food is pure artistry -- gastronomy without pretension. The chef is an expert at putting complex, unlikely flavors together in a complementary yet distinct way. You can clearly taste the freshness and pure essence of every ingredient. Every herb and grain *sings* and the textures are so interesting and pleasing on the palate.  \n\nFor me, the true measure of a restaurant is whether its main protein course delivers. So many upscale restaurants fail in this respect -- their starters and first courses are delicious, then the protein comes out and it's dry or undercooked or chewy or whatnot. This is NEVER the case at Commonwealth. Their protein dishes are consistently wonderful -- meltingly tender, flavorful, and moist.  We dine out a lot and visit the \"hot\" restaurants to stay up-to-speed, and we have yet to meet another restaurant in SF that can do proteins as reliably as Commonwealth. \n\nPrices are just as reasonable as they were when they first opened, and I love that they donate $10 from every tasting menu to charity! That's 13% -- beyond generous. We also love Commonwealth because the people are warm and welcoming and knowledgable. They provide very personalized service and take notes about your preferences for future visits. But most of all, the food simply cannot be beat. Whether it's a low-key dinner for two or a business dinner or a festive meal with friends, Commonwealth is our go-to place and we never get tired of coming here!!

You know right away looking at salmon crudo in a bath green tea, with ashed veggies, that this is a menu you would rarely try at home, and that's what makes it magic.   Each course was fabulous - the best scallop ever in a popcorn puree, and some kind of Japanese milk foam...damn it was good.  The wine parings were divers and well matched, ranging from vinos that stayed ot the side and complemented the more savory dishes (lightly batterfried sweetbreads? Amazing), to bolder wines that blended in with the particular course. \n\nColor us impressed, and Liz was delighted. Color me also with a thinner wallet @ almost $280 with tip, but ya know what? Sometimes, you need to splurge once in a great while and especially when it's worth it.

Probably because my boyfriend and I were still hungry after spending over $100 on the food (I'm not including wine here).\n\nThe food was very pretty. Covered in flowers and foam and leaves and all sorts of other lovelyness. But it wasn't spectacular for the most part. And I want things to be yummy more than I want them to be pretty. \n\nThe chips they give you in lieu of bread were good with the malt vinegar foam. But without the foam they taste pretty fishy (I believe they were dusted with seaweed or something like that). \n\nWe got beef tartare to start. I love beef tartare! It came plated in a dark bowl, so you couldn't really see what you were eating and it was awkward to serve. It had berries and flowers in it with these funky pumpernickel chips. The chips were not good. The beef tartar was probably the worst expensive beef tartare I've had in the city yet. And there was so little of it that my boyfriend, peering into the dark bowl, actually asked, \"where's the beef at?\"\n\nThen we had an artichoke plate and a chanterelle mushroom plate which we shared. We both loved the artichokes. They had some sort of creamy mouse that was quite lovely. The mushrooms were just not that flavorful and there were 4 mushrooms on the plate, surrounded by a forest of foams, mouses and this spongy green bread that didn't taste like much of anything at all. Beautiful, but not delicious. \n\nAt this point we had to start laughing about it. We waited anxiously for the pork shoulder main course, which we both chose, wondering if there was any chance that our bellies would be filled. Unfortunately, the portion size was very tiny. There was no starch on the plate. I guess I'm a traditionalist, but in my mind main course = protein + starch + greens/veggies. It felt unfinished. However it was very tasty, marvelously tender and covered in more flowers and artful flourishes. \n\nFinally, the ambiance. We kept wondering if the building had been an old clothing store or some other unglamorous item converted to a restaurant. We just so happened to be sitting next to the \"window\" which was frosted glass covered with graffiti. My boyfriend had a view of me, graffiti hovering over my head and right next to my shoulder the door's handicap open button. It wasn't warm or inviting.\n\nI wouldn't go back. There are too many amazing places in this city to give that one another chance.

I don't mind paying $5 for parking in the Mission at all, but there should be notification of a parking charge prior to the final bill.  Maybe the parking charge wouldn't even bother me if the meal was good, but it wasn't, so it feels like salt in the wound of a mediocre meal.....", "author": "Rosalyn C."}

The front of the restaurant is very unassuming and easy to miss.  The entrance is located on the side of the building off a small parking lot.  The parking lot holds 8 cars and is $5.\n\nI have to note that we had a lot of special dietary/ allergy restrictions and the restaurant did a great job of accommodating that but my guess is this messed up the course flow a bit for some of the menu.\n\nPotato chips w/ malt vinegar mouse - good potatoe chips.   \nSweet and sour eggplant - 4 stars -  nicely crisp pastry.  Sour flavor was good complement to the eggplant filling. \n\nSalmon Crudo, watermelon, celery, horseradish, tomato and green tea broth - 4 stars - the salmon was amazing and well paired with the watermelon,  the horseradish was subtle but balanced the dish perfectly.\nScallop, hearts of Palm, popcorn pur\u00e9e, pea greens, yuzu kosho milk - 4.5 stars - this dish was very good light dish.  The scallop was very well cooked,  I really enjoyed the popcorn pur\u00e9e.\nStone fruit, cucumber, nasturtium, almond milk, sake lees, puffed rice - 2 stars - The rest of my table raved about this dish! This dish my palate did not enjoy. I found the combination overwelming.  I assume my palate may not be sophisticated enough to enjoy this flavor, texture, spice combination. \nHake - 3 stars - fish was cooked well but flavors were mild compared to the rest of the courses.\nNote - others had pork and/or sweetbread main course.  The one'a who had pork said it was their favorite dish! The sweetbread got average reviews from those that had it.\nCelery sorbet with verjus soda - 4 stars - I did not fully enjoy the celery sorbet by itself however withe the verjus I thought it was excellent!\nBeer meringue, chocolate, pretzel crumble and creme  fraiche ice cream - 4 stars - very rich, smooth and delicious dessert!  \n\nThey gave us two post dessert bites.  Sorry I do not know what they were.  I can only say our entire table did not like either and we wish we did not leave dinner with that as our last taste:-(\n\nI noticed a portion of the menu seemed to carry undertones of flavors you find in cuisine in India.

Some of my pals didn't care for the food enough for a return trip, some found the vibe to be slightly less ambient than they'd anticipated, etc... But on the opposite end of the spectrum, I've had friends and colleagues rave about how much fun they've had here as well, and the common theme each time was that they enjoyed their evening sitting at the bar. I think we're onto something, cap'n! And with that kind of a lead up, you can probably guess where I found myself a few nights ago during my maiden voyage to Prospect's little sibling in the Mission.\n\nBased on the fact that Commonwealth was nominated for a James Beard award for Best New Restaurant this year, it's clear they've captured the attention of a few vocal foodies around the nation. And if I can guess what it was that helped them to stand apart from the tens of thousands of new eateries that popped up this year, I'd say it's their prowess in molecular gastronomy to create some truly remarkable fare with the help of using liquid nitrogen.\n\nSitting at the bar, you get to see this delicious science experiment at work first hand. It's hard not to be intrigued watching the process of their frozen popcorn or peanut butter semifreddo being made from scratch, and their frozen alcoholic selections are inspiring as well. It's the kind of show that could keep you entertained at the bar for hours, and it's an experience you just don't get dining at a two-top on the far end of the room. Aside from the niche antics in the kitchen, like most restaurants in the Bay Area, they source local, sustainable and organic ingredients whenever possible, have some pretty inventive a la carte menu items, and they also do a $65 six-course tasting menu with 10 of those dollars going towards different charities located around San Francisco. Splurging on piquant sustenance with a side of good karma is always a worthy food pairing.  \n\nIt does get busy, so your best bet is to come early, or stop in for a nightcap. If you're rolling during prime time hours, you'll have a hard time trying to secure your place. But... you should already know that, friendo.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

Commonwealth offers a tasting menu or a la carte.  But because everything looked interesting, and I admit, a bit horizon-expanding for me (sea urchin with \"coastal succulents\"), we took the plunge and tried it all.  You can't go wrong with any of the dishes here, but for me the squid and pork belly, and butter poached sturgeon were standouts.  The staff is friendly and incredibly knowledgable about the food.  The restaurant is understated and simple, much like the small, easy-to-miss wood sign marking the entry.  \n\nAs the plates kept arriving, I guess I got overly excited, and knocked over my wine. Bruised pride and wet menu notwithstanding, this was another memorable foodie experience is this amazing city. Come here with friends or for a date night.

Even the homemade chips are a play off of \"salt and vinegar chips,\" instead with seaweed and vinegar (foam) chips.\n\nWe started off the night by sharing a lumberjack. Although mislabeled as an aperitif, this sweet drink was surprisingly delicious.  The lumberjack is made frozen by liquid nitrogen and so you end up with an oh-so-smooth apple cider slushie with pomegranate seeds. We thought this would probably be better as a dessert given its fruity sweetness (and that you eat it with a spoon)\n\nWe then had the grass shrimp which at $6 was probably the best deal of the night. This dish is of tiny whole shrimp (shell, legs, head, etc) that are fried (but not crusted) and served with a garlic aioli. The end result is surprisingly succulent, juicy little shrimp with a perfect crunch given to them by the shell. Overall just incredible, and we loved the use of a probably underutilized protein source.\n\nThe asparagus salad was just okay unfortunately. It was quite a minimal salad with asparagus, greens, and avocado. The salad's claim to fame seems to be the sprinkled dehydrated olive with sugar. Although we admit this was a interesting part of the dish, overall it felt the salad was lacking the acidity often found in a dressing.\n\nThe uni & egg custard was artfully done with some of the most delicious uni we've had. It was a delicate dish; well balanced with little mushrooms and perfectly seasoned.\n\nThe sturgeon with ham hock was one of our favorite dishes of the night. The components of this dish just worked well together- the firm meatiness of the sturgeon with the salty tender ham hock, the balance of the brussels sprout leaves and the creamy cauliflower puree. Incredibly impressive although a relatively small portion. \n\nOur final dish of the night was the pork jowls which were the most disappointing. Even though we can deal with the fat content of pork belly, this dish was about 70% inedible- that's how fatty it was. This is especially upsetting when you just get three little pieces of meat. Overall, we would suggest skipping this one. It was a little sad considering that all the other components of the dish - asian pear, smoked cheese, thin and lacy toasts, and barley tasted fantastic together. It just missed badly on the protein.\n\nThe best seats in the house are also at the far end of the bar where you have a open view of the whole kitchen. It was really fun watching everyone prepare all the intricate dishes. Overall, we thought this place served beautiful, thoughtful food. Not everything was a hit, but we think that is just happens when you take risks with your food. As we use 2 stars as our average restaurant rating, our 4 star rating showed we quite enjoyed this place but that with its solid missed dishes and high prices, we weren't ready to give it a 5.", "author": "Amy D."}

Beginning first with the best 'salt and vinegar' chips I can imagine alongside a slushy-style cocktail that was playful yet spirit forward before transitioning to plates walking a fine line between modernist and classical, esoteric and accessible perhaps the most impressive aspect of the meal was just how well each plate bridged to the next, a symphony of textures and flavors touching every part of the palate - creamy uni balanced by brine, rich morels finding harmony with bitter black walnuts and nettles, and snappy squid and fatty pork belly melded by smoke and vinegar...each standing on their own but building on a theme that kept my attention from beginning to end, a task rarely achieved and all the more impressive as it arose outside the framework of a traditional tasting menu.", "author": "Michael U."}

Yowza!\n\nThe first dish came out with three separate areas of food and I thought perhaps it was the first three dishes on the same plate. But, alas...it wasn't. The root vegetable terrine was a piece of art as well as delicious. Also on this plate were crispy maitake mushrooms -- perhaps the only flaw in an otherwise perfect array of veggie dishes. The mushrooms needed a sauce...a little zing.\n\nThe second dish included Jerusalem artichoke; the exterior was delicately fried and the inside had been scooped out.\n\nDish #3 was a salad but perhaps the best salad I've ever had.

Definitely not enough acidity for a salad to counteract the cream and sweet nectarines. I didn't have the urchin, but my dining partner said it was mediocre (soggy fritters). \n\nEntrees: We had the sole which was ok but a little fishy and served with pesto rice that was slightly overcooked.

Our favorites of the night was the tomato salad, we swore it was the most amazing mozzarella we ever had, and they just melted in your mouth.  The scallops are perfectly seasoned and cooked. The albacore crudo was really yummo. And did I mention they had this peanut butter semifreddo that just made me fly up to heaven!! \n\nThe service was really impeccable. The staff was attentive, cool, and really knew their food. \n\nThe place is small and intimate.

Come to think about it,  that element is called....um.....PERSONALITY!\n\nThe ambiance is so similar to many spots in the Mish--that cozy, minimalist, clean lines, exposed pipes, white walls, kind of feel.

Could our waitress show any less interest in us?  So ambivalent.  No menu recommendations, no opinions, no personality.   Even at the end of the night, no offer of coffee or tea.  Just the check.

There is small lot next to restaurant and I recommend parking there. the neighborhood is a little more complicated and if you are dressed up, you probably want to as close as possible to the restaurant.\n\nBeautiful open kitchen where you can peek-in and see the staff working hard together and making artistic dishes.\n\n\n$75 6 course tasting menu\n*smoked avocado, trout roe, puffed grains, black mole, bean and lime broth (3.5 of 5)- Beautiful plating and many colors. Looked so beautiful and tasted very fresh and well balanced. The seafood was fresh, the puffed grains gave it an unexpected crunch, and the beans gave it a soft but fluffy texture. This was a fun dish to see and taste.\n*asparagus and eggs, sea urchin, egg mousse, herring roe, seaweed brioche (3.5 of 5)- Was expecting more from this dish. Again, beautiful plating, sea urchin was super fresh, but it wasn't a wow. The egg mousse was beautiful, but it actually was a little overpowering. The seafood brioche was an excellent idea, but other than being a great bottom layer holding up the sea urchin, I didn't really taste the seafood part. I like the texture it paired with the sea urchin, but I couldn't really taste any seafood. \n*green strawberries, bee and fennel pollens, goat cheese, mizuna, black radish (2 of 5)- I wish I swapped out this dish, because it was a little boring for me. The choice of salad pieces were good, but the flavors were very mellow. Even the goat cheese was mellow for me. \n*sweetbreads, fava bean and nettle porridge, ramps, pickled mustard seed (3 of 5)- Beautiful dish, but again it was a little boring for me. The sweetbreads sat ontop of a nice helpful scoop of fava bean and nettle porridge. Perfectly cooked and showered with mustard seed. Lots of texture, but taste was mellow.\n*celery sorbet, verjus soda (2 of 5) - Beautiful sorbet, unfortunately, celery and sorbet doesn't really work with my happy palate. This maybe too weird for me. It was done really well, but just weird. \n*peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, frozen popcorn(4 of 5)-Beautiful dessert. I am most surprised and still can't figure out what's up with the frozen popcorn. I imaging frozen hard piece of popcorn, instead, it looked like popcorn, but the texture was little creamballs. I am so confused. This was a beautiful dish, unfortunately, I am not a big peanut butter fan.\n\n*charred scallop ceviche, carrot-soy panna cotta, yuzu, crispy onion rings, mint 15 (4 of 5) - Swapped this with the first dish. Visible pleasing to the eye. Lots of little details on the dish and really had to take time to analyze it. Most interesting wasn't the scallop, but the carrot-soy panna cotta, that looked and tasted like a carrot, but had the texture of pudding. It was funny because it was a deconstructed and reconstructed carrot. Overall, this dish was pretty and well balanced.\n*squid and pork belly, soft boiled egg, hay smoked potatoes, pickled onions, fine herbs 15(4 of 5) - Added-on and not part of the tasting menu. Beautiful pieces. Squid was moist and cooked perfectly. Pork belly had melt in your mouth goodness. The pieces of the dishes didn't clash with each other, but neither did it wow in combination. \n*Wizard's Sleeve sake, earl grey, cocoa nib, lime & liquid nitrogen 13(3 of 5) - Was a fancy slushie. It looked like a scoop of slushie and tasted sweet and light. But it quickly melted and I was left with sweet sake. \n\nOverall, this place was very nice and demonstrated beautiful cooking techniques. Service was outstanding. However, some dish combinations weren't that pleasing. I would go back, but I might skip the tasting menu for $75. Their a la carte menu is around $15-$20/dish and I think I might like that more. I didn't really like that some of the tasting items were not on their regular menu, but I guess I will just have to live with it. Also, I might ask to sit at the bar facing the kitchen. I think I might appreciate the dishes more if I was able to watch the staff make and put together these complex dishes.", "author": "Janice T."}

Not because of fabulous memories, moral support in times of hurt, or having a second wardrobe. \n\nWhy? When choosing from an a la carte menu we can sample almost everything! Also, having friends with good taste is a blessing.\n\nWhen a few friends and I met for dinner at Commonwealth, most of the menu was primed to be plundered by my personal culinary team.\n\nWe all ordered the Narwahl, a liquid nitrogen adult version of an Icee, with filtered sake, melon, lime and an aperitif fortified with Armagnac. Resounding awes all around.\n\nThe aforementioned a la carte menu features innovative dishes listed in a traditional order (starters, vegetables, fish and meat), and lends itself perfectly to friendly style sharing. We asked to keep the menus with us so we could read along with the food and not risk being illiterate when eating these complex dishes.\n\nThe complimentary nori potato chips with malt vinegar foam was subject to an onslaught of greedy fingers.  The foam wasn't too alien or 'out there', though were very strong.\n\nThe highlights of our communal meal:\n\ngarden tomatoes and basil, black olive crumble, smoked bread, and idiazabal cheese-this was a my favorite appetizer; the garden produce perfectly paired with the smokey and smooth flavors of the bread and cheese.\n\nfluke crudo with peach, rose gelee, jicama, and douglas fir tips: the most beautiful of the dishes, and probably my favorite. Perfectly diced and juicy peach paired with the crunchy jicima-there's never been a more successful pair since peaches and cream. Actually, the fluke added a creamyish flavor, so this is the perfect dish!\n\nmarrow stuffed squid, tamarind pork, shelling beans, and black garlic: another favorite dish that left me speechless.\n\nOne dessert we had was a deconstructed s'more: okay, this might have been my favorite dessert ever. Cinnamon-dusted mille-feuille, cardamon marshmellows, chocolate ganache, and the amazing burnt-honey ice cream that even rivals Bi-Rites. \n\nNearly everything about our experience here was flawless.

So in a sense, it's like tapas-style but the portions are a little bit smaller\n-There is parking (!!!!) that they'll charge $5 to your bill for but it sure as hell beats finding parking on Mission Street\n-This place is definitely one of those gastronomy places which means there was quite a bit of creativity, which was awesome. \n\nOkay now to the review. I came here with a group of 4 so the waitress suggested that we ordered 3 plates each since the dishes are pretty small. We decided to order the entire menu (and a few items off the tasting menu) since that came out to roughly 3 plates/person. The great thing about ordering the entire menu is that you get to try EVERYTHING. The bad thing is that you get to try everything, which means this review is of EVERY dish. While there were a few dishes that were total hits, there were also quite a few misses. This is something that I think would have been easily avoided if you didn't order the entire menu (duh). Hence, my 3-star review because I have to rate it on everything I tried.\n\nHere were some of the big hits for me:\n-The crudo - it was off the tasting menu and it was DELICIOUS.\n-Cedar grilled mussels, pork belly, broccoli bread pudding, celery root, saffron, cured egg - This dish was WOW! The broccoli bread pudding?? Looks like a freakin' piece of foam but when you taste everything together, it's like magic in your mouth. Also really loved the creativity of this dish\n-The pork belly was SO fatty and juicy. Yum yum. If you're into that, then you'll definitely love this\n-peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, frozen popcorn - The semifreddo was so full of peanut flavor and it was great. The ganache frozen popcorn was one of those gastronomy moments that I still don't know how I feel about the execution. Very creative but I'm still on the fence about how I feel about the popcorn. You should just try it though\n\nThe rest of the menu to me was kind of meh. It wasn't terrible but it didn't stand out to me either. It was just okay. Since we ate about 13 dishes, we had more \"okay\" dishes than \"WOW\" dishes. \n\nSo, if you DECIDE to do the whole menu, just know that obviously not everything will be amazing but it will still be solid.", "author": "Diana Y."}

I also did the wine pairing and I think it was the best pairing I have ever had.\n\nThe highlight for me was a trout dish with horseradish snow.  Weirdly cold and bursting in your mouth.  So good and fun.  The other interesting part was a palette cleanser that was a celery sorbet.  Again, odd but good and served its purpose.  Oh I almost forgot, they let me substitute the sweetbreads for the monk fish.  I did try a bite of the sweetbreads (for the first time) and it was tasty.

But no, I got whatever I ordered which turned out to be Fresh Radish from their rooftop garden topped with soil.  Yes, it was soil, but it was good, but its soil. Moving on, the rest of the dishes were not as traumatizing as the radish dish, but in the words of my wise boyfriend during dinner: \"it feels like I'm just chewing different ingredients for different dishes\".

The homemade chips they serve instead of bread are out of this world. The asparagus with slow cooked egg was incredible. \n\nCons:\nThe menu is limited and the portions are small. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person which ends up being quite expensive. Most of the dishes we ate just weren't very good. The pork jowl tasted like undercooked hunks of fat. The fromage blanc was mostly chicory leaves, and there was hardly any seasoning so the dominant flavor was bitter.

Finally settling in at a table at a very reasonable 7:45 PM (the reservation was made well in advance, something made me feel that Commonwealth was trying just  a little  too hard. I think it started around the time that the malt vinegar foam hit the table (to accompany the house made chips) of which I ate exactly 3. One first to get a taste for it, one chip by itself to figure out what the chip tasted like, and one again to really focus on the malt vinegar foam. \n\nTo me, one of the dangers of the molecular gastronomy movement is  that some things really click and others aren't really adding much to the meal. I'm sure that the microgreens that accompanied my sardines (well they actually used mackerel that night) were very carefully selected for flavor, mouthfeel, etc, but I didn't find it added much to the dish. The slight lemon flavor on the branzino however was a nice touch. I also ordered the spring peas because I was very interested with how they would prepare the yuba as I've never really been able to do much with yuba in my own kitchen. I also found here that it wasn't too exciting and found this dish ultimately lacking much flavor or appeal. \n\nFor dessert I shared  the peanut butter semifreddo with chocolate ganache. This dish reminded me of a grown up version of a snickers ice cream bar as it combined the classic bff flavors of chocolate, peanut (butter), and caramel. The frozen popcorn provided a nice salty flavor to add the grown up flair. Call me a little kid, but I think I'd prefer the classic Snickers Ice Cream bar. \n\nThe dishes look gorgeous, and the menu although small offers a range of options you wouldn't find elsewhere. Commonwealth offers a dining experience that stands out amongst the other Mission area eateries. Nothing struck me as particularly memorable or rave worthy.", "author": "Stephen S."}

Wine pairing only extra $30--would've loved to be able to do that \n- Foie gras bon bons: omg yes highlight of the meal. Most artistic, spectacular, inventive, and delicious concept come to life. I can barely ever pass up foie and have had a good amount lately, but this is the tops. LOVED it. Chocolately outside and rich and creamy inside almost impersonating peanut butter. \n- Peanut butter semifreddo dessert: crisp chocolate shell, peanut butter mousse, and cracker base with a line of perfect caramel on the plate. Worth breaking my non sweets streak for.\n- Root salad: gorgeous and multi-faceted. The part I enjoyed the most was the vegetable dust which was ground up veggie scraps processed in such a way looked like crushed Oreo specs but more flavor. The waiter described the complex multiple step creation process and all I could think was who thinks of doing all that? Completely paid off \n- Hen: succulent pieces of meat but likes the medley on plate between leaves and petals and pistachios and the tasty jus, they all came together to elevate the dish. \n- Potato chips: loved the thin crisp potato chips being put on the table to start, as they were delicious and set the right whimsical mood for the meal. Only complaint is wish the seaweed flavor was stronger, as I was intrigued by it but was absent to me.\n- Atmosphere: refined, immaculate, comfortable, and casual \n- Service: our waiter explained dishes and wine expertly in great detail\n- Reservation confirmation process: when they called confirm, in their message they told to call only if plans change which I appreciate. I don't like having to call back to confirm reservation I have made.\n\nMidlights:\n- Farm egg raviolo: always love a runny egg and was fine and rich with the uni broth, but overall was the plate that didn't do that much for me. This response is probably because of my disinterest in uni and caviar which were featured supporting stars here, so fans of these may love this dish.\n\nLowlights:\n- Parking: there is a lot beside it, but it's extremely small (maybe can fit 5-7 cars) so was full even for a 5:30pm weekday reservation. They don't have a valet so have to rely on street parking.\n- Tables for 2 placement: they are in a line on the back wall very close together\n\nEnjoyed this reasonably priced foodie treat and would love to come back.", "author": "Eve K."}

The delicate spherical cheese and the crunchy olives were perfect compliments to the heirloom tomatoes.\n \n** Potato Gnocchi, Corn, Maitake Mushrooms, Sage, Parmesan Reggiano and Truffle Oil - Perfectly cooked gnocchi. Anything with truffle oil is automatically amazing.\n\n* Corn Custard, Sea Urchin, Chorizo, Lobster Emulsion and Jalapeno - Unique texture of the corn custard, very much like silky tofu.\n\n* Butter Poached Black Cod, Cauliflower, Dashi and Sea Beans - Soft and flaky black cod with a delicious crispy skin.\n\n* Young Hen and Spot Prawn, Spinach, Artichoke and Chocolate-Almond Emulsion - Very tender hen and tasty prawn with a yummy sauce.\n\n** White Russian: Coffee Ice Cream, Vodka Gel\u00e9e, Raw Milk Mousse, and G\u00e9noise Cake - Fantastic, and a must if you're a fan of coffee.\n\n** Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, and Burnt Honey Ice Cream - This was AMAZING!

Our server warned us that their portions were small so get 6 dishes between the two of us to share.  Since we also bought in a homemade cake, we thought we would get 5 dishes to see how it goes.  Oh boy, the dishes were REALLY small.  While it's not really a big surprised for this type of fine dining restaurants, we definitely thought it's smaller than the usual fine dining options in the city.  While the taste of each dish was complex, the ingredients used didn't really stand out.  One of our dishes was a scallop dish served along with a mix of grains in a beets sauce.  The scallop was so small to a point that we didn't realize it was the scallop dish and let alone the taste of scallop was overpowered by all the sides.  We also had the black cod that was overly salty and I had to split it out.  I later told the server about it but she didn't do anything about it.

Luckily things started off well with the kombu dusted potato chips which were an amazing starter!\n\nI was dining with Chad S. who got the Narwhal - a funky drunk that's part slushie but includes Floc de Gascogne, sake, ambrosia melon and lime. It had quite a little kick and was a really unique flavor that was quite tasty!\n\nSince Mister Bill suggested the Crispy Pig Ears we got those too which were like pork rinds but upscale.\n\nI tasted some of Chad's Summer Squash Soup which was chilled and full of flavor and totally refreshing.  I had the Garden Tomatoes and Basil which was delish.  The tomatoes were bursting with flavor and the  idiazabal cheese globules were awesome - I hadn't had that type of cheese before and love it.\n\nFor my main I had the Young Hen & Spot Prawn which was pretty good.  I have to say I like the hen much more than the prawns.  It did remind me of eating crawdads Cajun style in the South and I even sucked the head and inauspiciously as possible since the space is a bit more fancy than most crawfish boils I'd been to in Alabama and Louisiana.\n\nFor dessert I had the White Russian which had coffee ice cream, vodka gelee, raw milk mousse and genoise cake. It was pretty awesome even though of course it's not quite like the drink, but I didn't expect it to.\n\nI'd love to come back and try the tasting menu some time, since many of the items on that piqued my interest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-30", "description": "I don't rate a restaurant one star lightly, but after eating here twice I believe this restaurant is a case of the emperor wearing no clothes. The kitchen has no idea what it's doing, and is hiding behind esoteric ingredients and sophisticated presentation.\n\nThe spring peas and fromage blanc course was an illustration of a chef who is in over his head. The spring peas themselves were lovely and fresh, but their delicate flavor is completely overwhelmed by the other ingredients.  This was not an error in execution, but was a flawed dish by design.\n\nThe pork shoulder was prepared sous vide. Sous vide may be all the rage these days, but in this case it was the worst possible method of preparation.  Sous vide is wonderful for drawing out the moisture and fat in lean cuts of meat that can otherwise be dry or dull flavored. With the pork shoulder, this method of cooking turned the entire cut into a fatty, gristly mess.\n\nIt seems some ingredients are selected because they are unusual, not because they taste good.  It's hard to imagine anyone actually enjoying the taste of the beef heart, for example. I have nothing against beef heart -- in fact, there are a couple of Mexican joints in the neighborhood that serve up a delicious rendition of it -- but this one is dry, heavy, and rank tasting. The green garlic broth in the egg dish is another example -- while it might be interesting to look at, few people with functioning taste buds would enjoy eating it.\n\nAll in all, we had 10 dishes that ranged from mediocre to inedible. We didn't stay for dessert so I can't comment on whether the pastry program is as clueless as the main kitchen.", "author": "David C."}

Very much looking forward to the experience, I was sure to make reservations in advance.  They have an adjoining parking lot, so there was no need to park blocks away.  Just make sure to give yourself a bit of time, as the lot can get full.\n\nEven with the many enticing choices for that evening, we decided on the tasting menu, to which we added the sea urchin entree.  Unexpectedly, this was way more food than we needed, but it was all delicious nonetheless.  Call it a mistake on the part of someone who doesn't experience tasting menus that often.  The meal was paced out over approximately 2 hours.  Other diners seated next to us who didn't choose the tasting menu finished dining in about 1 hour or so.  With the slower pace of our meal, I could feel the effects of ordering the extra entree taking a toll on me.  That and the 2 desserts as the finale.  I can't remember the desserts exactly, but I know one was a granita.  The other was reminiscent of a cold, full-sized snickers bar.  I guess that was their take on the classic candy bar.  That one definitely did me in.  \n\nI was one of those annoying diners, who took pictures of every single dish I was served.  But, several folks at other tables that evening were doing the same thing, so I'm sure this restaurant is quite used to such behavior.  Service was pleasant and attentive.  They also patiently answered any questions I had about the menu or dishes presented.   \n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable dining experience.  \nThe atmosphere was somewhat casual, and with tables close to each other, the noise level can be up and down, depending on the crowd.  \nThe price of $65 per person is very reasonable considering the quality of the food, presentation, and service.

Eh.\n\nOn the table: House cooked potato chips with a malt vinegar foam. I read about this. It was alright. I wasn't impressed. The foam was too vinegary.\n\nWine: Riesling. Eva Fricke's Lorche. Absolutely delightful. Great start.\n\nAla carte. Six dishes total, three dishes per person. The menu is organized into \"proteins.\" Is that arrogant? I don't know.\n\nMy dishes:\n-\"Slow-cooked\" farm egg with quinoa, black garlic, sprouted broccoli, carrots, and red lettuce.\n-Sea-urchin on top of tempura something.\n-Pork jowl \n\nThe egg when popped is just like any other dish you have egg yolk all over. Is it me or is it my undeveloped palate that could not appreciate this dish like it was supposed to? I don't know, however, I felt healthy just eating it, so it wasn't bad. It just did not \"wow\" me. I like to be \"wowed.\"\n\nThe sea urchin dish was interesting; interesting in that I've never had those combinations before so I have still yet to say if I REALLY liked it or not. What I liked about it was the sea-urchin.YUMM. I love sea-urchin to DEATH so I could eat with a hamster and I'd be good(Just kidding to all the animal protection people). The combo of it all was good, I liked the crispiness of the tempura with the saltiness of the sea-urchin. \n\nThe pork jowl. It was a fatty pork. Does that turn you off? Well it's the ONLY reason why I ordered it. How can you turn down fatty pork?? I could NOT and can NOT call myself a Filipina-American if I did NOT like FATTY PORK!!!! I declare that NOW. I am NOT ashamed to like fatty pork!! That stuff is DELICIOUS!!!!\n\nThe dish itself, I ate it so slowly, I didn't want my romantic experience with my fatty pork jowl to end. I was courting it, cutting tiny pieces of it and savoring that flavor in my mouth. I really wanted to cry, scream with delight and MOAN with pleasure. I loved it. \n\nWe skipped dessert to head over to Bi-Rite Creamery a few blocks away.  \n\nThe experience was memorable. Am I coming back? Yes, but not to order an organic egg I can fry myself at home. \n\nThe ambience: Classy and modern. As my friend Olive says, \"Class in the middle of gritty.\" Love it.

The concept of the restaurant is unique (Commonwealth - for the good of the people...and they in fact donate $ from each tasting menu to charity).\n\nPrices are good with everything costing $15 or less per dish if you do go with the a la carte option. However, you will probably have to get two dishes per person if you do a la carte since the dishes are small and meant to be shared.\n\nThe tasting menu is $60, and although it looked outstanding (with 6 different dishes), I was a little disappointed to see that everything on the tasting menu was actually not available on the a la carte menu.\n\nNext time, will definitely opt for the tasting menu since it makes each dish average out to only $10 each and they actually donate $10 from each tasting menu to a local non-profit.\n\nAmbiance is nice and cozy, pretty small but large enough for a great date or small group outing.

Our server was knowledgeable and made some pretty great suggestions, both for wine and for food.  Per her recommendation, we had 6 dishes between two people, which is a good-sized dinner.  Then we got two desserts (WE HAD TO).\n\nAnyway, high/lowlights:\n\nSlow-cooked egg - The plating reminded me of an enchanted forest meadow.  The green mint bread pudding looked like moss, and the snap peas provided the foliage, and the translucent egg, with its runny yolk was....uh...the polluted stream running through the landscape? Really though, all that was missing was a fairy and this could've been FernGully.  The taste of this dish was...interesting.  I won't say it's my favorite combination of flavors, but it's for sure some of the more memorable.\n\nSea urchin - I honestly don't remember what else was in the dish besides the sea urchin, I think something with wasabi, and some sort of cracker.  All that is besides the point, though, because this is THE BEST UNI I have ever had.  Buttery and just...incredible.\n\nBeef heart - This was reallllly tasty.  I love the texture of it, and it paired really well with the ramps and the cauliflower foam.\n\nPeanut butter semifreddo - This isn't quite what I had imagined in my head.  It was basically a candy bar with mousse in the middle and a chocolate shell, and the mousse inside wasn't really frozen or even semi-frozen.  So you can say the semifreddo left me a little cold (or not cold enough, I suppose).\n\nOverall I think this place has a lot going for it.  Good food, good wine, good vibes.  It's not pretentious at all, and the wait staff are really friendly.  I will for sure Come-and-yelp-again, amiright?! (STILL NO.)", "author": "jon y."}

Fresh and tasty, the chef complements garden tomatoes with basil, black olive crumble, smoked bread, and idiazabal cheese from the Basque region of Spain. The \"compressed watermelon\" accompanied by tofu, nori, cucumber, wild greens, and togarashi (a Japanese 7-spice blend that typically includes red chile flakes, dried orange peel, white sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, nori flakes, poppy seeds and ginger) was so good it disappeared faster than lightning. The soft, light potato gnocchi was accompanied by fresh sweet corn, rich maitake mushrooms, sage, and parmesan reggiano--just delicious\n\nIn addition to the a la carte menu, the tasting menu priced at $60 for six courses (wine pairing only $30 additional) is a fantastic bargain.  It provides a low-pressure way to try some really exciting new foods.  What's more, since the restaurant donates $10 from each tasting menu served to a local food-oriented charity, diners can feel good about eating well.\n\nService is attentive and knowledgeable.  The waiter easily fielded questions about the intricate preparations of many of the dishes, and dishes arrived at a pace that was neither too fast, nor too slow.  \n\nThe wine list is small, but reasonably priced with ample selections both by the glass and by the bottle.  Corkage is a reasonable (for SF) $15.\n\nWith innovative preparation, beautiful presentation, and delicious creations, Commonwealth is a standout.

I know that's a bold statement, but this place has been an absolute darling for the past two years! From the intimate vibe, to the constantly updated wine list, to the creative seasonal menus, you can tell that Jason Fox is tremendously thoughtful about his dishes and craft. \n\nTips and observations:\n- Reservations are helpful, but not necessary - I've been here ~6 times and each time snagged two spots at the bar within 10 minutes.\n- Atmosphere is dim, warm, and at a perfect decibel of muted conversation.\n- Open kitchen behind the bar.\n- Dinner begins with a delicious bowl of nori-dusted potato chips with malt vinegar foam. It takes superhuman restraint to decline a second (or third) helping when offered.\n- Bartenders are extremely helpful with wine-by-the glass selection, and will pour you tastings before you commit.\n- If you want something off the tasting menu a la carte, they'll usually ask the chef and accommodate.\n- You will have consumed an entire nasturtium plant by the end of dinner.\n- Great for vegetarians - surprisingly, I often end up enjoying the veggie options on the menu most.\n- Can't go wrong with ANY dish on the menu. Fo' real.\n- You'll need to order 5-7 dishes between two people to actually fill up. \n- Perfect for a date, nice dinner with parents, or group of 4.\n\nNow go cancel your other reservations and check out Commonwealth.", "author": "Nancy Y."}

Making it worse was a Cabernet Sauvignon that completely overpowered what little flavor the venison offered.\n\nThe foie gras was very good; though it's really hard to prepare foie gras badly.

I enjoyed the ambiance, trendy, cozy, hip and fun without too much of a formal -- this is an expensive restaurant type deal.  I thought that the staff was wonderful, friendly and warm without being too overbearing.  Here when you need them, or have questions. \n\nThat night they offered two options on the tasting menu and we ordered one of each. 2 months later nothing stands out too much to me except for the Uni they served that night.  I have never had Uni, I am not an adventurous eater and so I was scared silly to even try it.  But it was very good, Uni was said to taste like the Sea but to me it just tasted really good.  The mister agrees with me and from his experiences this was probably the best that he has had.  The wagyu beef was also very very good, melt in your mouth and chewy. \n   \nThey served two dessert dishes and though I am most fond of desserts was a little much.  Would much rather have preferred another savory dish.  We left still a little hungry, and for the price (however much it was, which I am guessing a decent amount) could have been better.

The pork-belly and lamb cheeks were really good, and the veggies and sides complimented them. The wines, by report, were excellent and included less-common varieties (malbec?)\n\nThe portions are small by Denny's standards, but they are quite good for normal humans eating reasonably. They give the full flavor and allow one to share with companions, but do not tempt one into eating so much that nothing is memorable.\n\nThe staff on on it: they attend quickly and know about the food and the wines. The building is a cinder-block box, however inside it is well laid-out, subtly decorated, and nice. The only problem is the cycle of the motion-activated light in the parking lot distracted from dinner.\n\nWe both chose an appetizer, an entree, and dessert, along with wine for one of us.

A fancy, special-occasion dinner (our anniversary, as it happens) that focused on good food and service, not gilt decor and fluff.\n\nCommonwealth is memorable.", "author": "Richard H."}

The puffed rice was an ingenious addition to provide good contrasting crunch to the dish.\n* Sweetbreads poached in beeswax - this was the most underwhelming dish.  It was solid but did not push the boundaries in terms of taste creativity.  Not sure how one can poach anything in beeswax?\n* Celery sorbet - this was great and a nice finishing touch!  Kind of wish the menu ended here...\n* Chocolate ganache with beer meringue - this became the 2nd dessert course and at this point, I was all sweeted out.  Great dessert though.\n* Courtesy plate of truffle chocolates and toasted honey bites\n\nAll in all, there were some spectacular dishes (the amuse bouche and salmon crudo top of mind) and some solid dishes. But what I really loved was how this was an eating adventure throughout the evening.  I did not give the restaurant 5 stars since I felt that the tasting menu leaned towards very sweet flavors, whether in the salmon crudo (watermelon), stonefruit salad, 2 dessert courses and then the chocolates at the end.  I wish the sweetness was more balanced out with more savory or acidic notes through my entire dinner. \n\nI would come here again, a really fun experience in a great ambiance setting.", "author": "Van Anh N."}

This restaurant not only deserves a five but a six.  \n\nI was with a group and everyone kept spotting a delectable item on the tasting menu.  The only caveat was that everyone had to order the tasting menu.  For me it was a no brainer--I wanted to taste everything on the tasting menu.  \n\nRarely have I seen in a San Francisco restaurant was nearly flawless service--orchestrated service--which I like and greatly appreciate.  Bringing out all dishes at one time is a thrill for me.\n\nThe tasting menu offered a lot of flavours and at $65 is a bargain--I have had many a tasting menu for considerably more but less satisfying.  The black truffle amuse bouche was the entry I needed for this meal--earthy, a hint of sweet but ultimately it was a savory soup, the radish salad was perfectly balanced--delightful textures, crunch and hit on savory-sweet was apparent but not overly so and the two cheeses give depth but does not deter from the entire plate.\n\nI did enjoy the Foie Gras--soon to be not found in California--rich, fresh, beautifully plated and brave.  A dinner mate said that the Foie Gras seems to be so controversial but compared with industrial agricultural that other meat products could be banned.  The Venison-and I am least likely to order Venison if I was ordering a la carte--was fresh and perfectly prepared--medium and the maple syrup paired well with the ever present Cardamom.  Chef must have known I was going to be there--a haunting and gorgeous note--the Kale was perfect and sweet potato mousse delicate and a delightful background flavour profile.  \n\nThe blood orange Sorbet was unlike any Sorbet I have tasted before--evenness in terms of sweetness--flavour packed and delightful.  \n\nWhen I first saw the tasting menu I saw the dessert and was not moved--perhaps a bit unexcited--that is until it was served.  The peanut butter semifreddo was beautiful and simple and not overwhelming.  The frozen popcorn looked like cheese at first but a bit on fork gave a packed and pronounced note of salty-sweet popcorn goodness.  I took the fork and got a bit of frozen popcorn a lightly added to peanut butter semifreddo and was transported.  Convincing and transformative.\n\nA beautiful meal, a great experience.

You can skip the oysters and the matsutake mushrooms.\n\nNow, about the service:  We had a Monday reservation for four at 8:30 pm.  We weren't seated until 9:15.  The hostess kept coming by to apologize and said they wanted to do something nice for us, but I'm not sure what that ever was.\n\nWe ordered a cocktail and a bottle of wine while we waited at the bar.  We got the cocktail, but never got the bottle of wine.  20 minutes later we were seated and still no wine (we even mentioned that we ordered a bottle at the bar and did not get it).  Finally when they came to take our order, we reordered the bottle of wine.  Seriously, over an hour at a restaurant and NO DRINKS???\n\nAs you can imagine, it was a long night.  We had three courses (apps, mains, desserts) and we weren't out of there until 12:15.  If you're doing the math, that's nearly a 4 hour dinner (including the wait).

Commonwealth have a good location on mission. The place is beautiful and their upstairs garden is awesome. We were given the choice of water or sparkling water. So compliment to what we ordered, they gave the chips with vinegar foam. Interesting flavor, but I am not a fan of the vinegar foam. To start off, they also gave us a taster of their cured salmon. It is tasty, although my piece still had a little bit of sinew.\n We ordered the asian pear salad, wild clams, uni crudo, chanterelle mushrooms, salt cod fritters, duck breast, and the pork. The flavor in the pear salad is spectacular, herbaceous and the pears I assume are slightly marinated to taste more peary. The clams were very clammy. I'm still not sure if I liked it or not, but the concept of the dish is to taste like the sea. The uni crudo is very good though. Very fresh and colorful. The combination of the kale with the seaweed is like umami taking place.  The chanterelle mushrooms, however, was a disappointment. Sour, and the mushrooms needed to be cooked in a hotter pan for more flavor and browning. The salt cod is good. The mussel saffron sauce is key to the dish, but the fritters were also tasty,probably one of the best fritters I've tasted so far.\nThe pork dish is fantastic. I highly recommend it. Very good balance in flavor and the pickles are outstanding. The duck dish was a little bit too pretentious. There were many elements on the dish, making it hard to eat the duck. The rice is unnecessary in my opinion. I would like more celery root. The duck itself is cooked perfectly however. \nJason Fox also hooked us up with lamb dish that was on their tasting prefix. Flavor of the lamb is good, not overpowered. I liked the smoked pumpkin. The mole needed a bit of tweaking. I felt that it needed more spice and needed to be reduced a little longer for a stronger taste to compliment the lamb. It also needed more chocolate to it. \nAfter our meal, he also hooked us up with the celery sorbet with the house fermented grape wine. I forgot what they called it. That celery sorbet is awesome. Really refreshing and changed my perception of celery. We ordered their beer meringue dessert made with ninkasi stout. Very good. At the end, we got our bill and also hooked us up with the peanut butter truffles and marshmallows. Overall the experience is amazing. I would definitely come back, not only as a customer, but also a freelancing chef. All the dishes are very very very artistic.", "author": "Kevin L."}

One a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I'm giving this place the motherfucking milky way! \n\nAs you can probably tell from my previous review, I loved this place to begin with, so you can imagine that for a low key elopement, I could think of no better place to patronize for my wedding dinner with my husband. I mentioned in our reservation that we were eloping, and they really pulled out all the stops for us. As soon as we rolled up in our big yellow checker cab, some of the staff lined up outside the restaurant to greet us and told us how genuinely excited they were to have us dine with them that night. As per usual, the food and wine knocked our socks off. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings in addition to a few more dishes in addition to a bottle of champagne that we later found was a gift to us from the restaurant. \n\nSo to Will, Xelina, and the rest of the incredible staff, thank you from the bottom of my heart for an absolutely memorable night. I might have been a little too tipsy to have fully expressed my gratitude the night of, but it meant the world to me to be able to celebrate this special day with you.", "author": "Clarissa S."}

None of the courses were memorable.  The restaurant is very dark, which is too bad, because, the presentation of each dish was beautiful.  The courses all seemed too busy, i.e., too many components that did not necessarily go together.  Many modernist techniques were used, but they didn't seem to really contribute taste-wise to the dishes.  Most importantly most courses were on the bland side.  It was almost impossible to discern most of the components of the dishes as the flavors were so underwhelming.  The venison served was very tasty, but tough and chewy.  Bottom line:  beautiful food, but the taste is not there.", "author": "Chris F."}

This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in the City.\nThe tasting menu experience is honestly so sublime that we had to start making Commonwealth our last dinner destination when we visit because after we have dine here all other food experiences pale in comparison.\nOur fantastic meal started off with chips with vinegar mousse and glasses of bubbly. This was closely followed by a  yummy clam amuse bouche and then a little cup of warm mushroom consomme tinged with the flavor of dark chocolate. Mmmmmm.\nThe first dish was a lovely salmon crudo in green tea broth. Aside from being delicious, the food at Commonwealth is like eating edible art-so beautiful.\nNext, the scallop dish was phenomenal and my favorite! It goes without saying that the scallop was perfectly cooked and the whimsical  popcorn puree was so good.\nThis dish was followed by the refreshing stonefruit dotted with bright splashes of colorful nasturtium flowers. I wish I knew how the kitchen geniuses do it but they put together the most unexpected ingredients on the plate and when combined make magic in your mouth!!!\nAfter the salad, the kitchen sent us out a delicious treat consisting of zucchini done three ways that tasted like a little bit of summer.\nAs we like to try as much as possible when we have the opportunity to visit Commonwealth the kitchen was gracious enough to let me try the wonderful pork dish and D had the amazing sweetbreads.\nI must say that this is one of the few restaurants at which we have NEVER felt rushed. The amazing staff is always attentive and gives us the opportunity to truly enjoy our dining experience and each other. Few restaurants are capable of this and we appreciate it greatly.\nI think I am out of words to describe how wonderful the celery sorbet with verjus soda is. I will just say every spoonful was savored to the fullest possible extent. \nFinally, the desserts were great. D stuck with the tasting menu's beer meringue but I was able to substitute the decadent pot de creme- and oh dear god was it delicious.\nWe came to the conclusion after dinner that Commonwealth is so damn good-- and we could not think of another way to describe it- but  that it really puts us into another state of consciousness.\nThank you for the delightful evening!", "author": "Christina R."}

And most of Mission St.'s usual patrons could not afford this minimalist, expensive foodie spot. \n\nI went in anyway on the promise of good food. When I saw the menu, I thought I could get away with one or two of their $15-$20 dishes. Each plate is TINY. Not the case. You must order 3-4 and with alcohol that adds up. The food was decent, but greasy and heavy. We ordered the curros, soft-shell crab (which doesn't need to be deep-fried as they do..it is delicious broiled as well), halibut (in heavy cream sauce), and a veggie dish, which was the best we had. \n\nI left the restaurant with the taste of grease in my mouth and a hole in my pocket. People who chose the chef's sampling menu looked like they were enjoying it. I just wasn't prepared to shell out the $ 65/person. I thought I was going to a restaurant on Mission St after all.

As you sit in the quiet and warm decor behind glazed windows, you forget that you are sitting squarely on noisy and vibrant Mission Street.\n\nThe seating here is a bit tight, so it is impossible to not pick up on your neighbor's conversation. The staff tries to recommend the tasting menus of 6-courses, but as a vegetarian, I chose a la carte. I ordered a salad of sorts, with mushrooms and a glaze of cheese melted on top. However, there was a problem.\n\nWriggling in the leaves was a tiny, green caterpillar. \n\nI am not a diner to cause a scene. I noticed the bug as soon as my waitress handed me the plate and I let her know. She apologized profusely and offered to get me a replacement. Now, I tried to look on the bright side of this situation: I was being given fresh ingredients, greens that  were probably grown without pesticides, so I wasn't freaking out. I gladly ate the replacement dish that was brought to me a few minutes later. I even proceeded to order dessert and shared it with my friend.\n\nYet, when the bill came, I saw that we were being charged for everything. The wine, the appetizers, my meal, the dessert. I am not one who is looking for handouts, but I would think that a restaurant of this caliber would have attempted to correct their wrongs by offering some sort of compensation. In fact, our waitress really didn't acknowledge the incident after it initially occurred-- there wasn't a repeat apology! \n\nI was honestly surprised and taken aback. As good as the food was, I really expected this situation to be handled differently, especially as I (or any customer) could have easily created a scene and blown it out of proportion. For that, I don't think I will be returning to Commonwealth, and I am sharing this story with anyone who asks my opinion.", "author": "Bryan B."}

The food was very interesting, and it felt similar to, but also a notch better than Red Medicine in LA. The style of food was a bit too precious for me, and with both Commonwealth and Red Medicine (except maybe the porridge), I never got a spoonful of food that was just viscerally satisfying. Our halibut was cooked perfectly and the spring peas were good, but the peas felt like they were trying to do something that Ubuntu would execute. The Cobra Kai aperitif was pretty interesting and delicious. I don't think I'm in a hurry to go back, but it was a neat experience.\n\nAs much as I imagine SFers are in love with Alice Waters and what she stands for, this feels very much the opposite.  Sure, they use seasonal ingredients, but the style of cooking seems to focus a bit more on style, visual appeal, and texture.  I feel like this is the type of restaurant that would be 5stars for some, and just be totally lost on others.", "author": "Andrew T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-06", "description": "I was really excited about trying Commonwealth - there's been so much buzz.  I'd been saving it up for months for a special occasion.  So when my friend was visiting SF from the east coast, I thought it would be a perfect opportunity.  We had a reservation for 9 pm for four people on a Friday night.  Given that this place is apparently very popular, I would recommend making a reservation.  Sadly, we ended up being disappointed with our experience.  \n\nI must admit - it was a bad idea to begin drinking champagne in the park at 2 pm.  And it was also a bad idea to go to Latin America Club for a blackout margarita prior to going to dinner.  However, no matter my level of drunkenness - I am POSITIVE that the food, drink, and experience we had at Commonwealth were nowhere near worth what we paid.  \n\nWe decided to just share a few small plates - which were REALLY SMALL folks - like tiny portions.  And we ended up ordering two bottles of the house wine over the course of the meal.  The only memorable dish was sea urchin covered in a chimichurri sauce, but again - the portion size was very small.  The pork loin dish was just average.  Malt chips were decent, at least had good flavor.  The kicker - these three tiny plates and two bottles of wine cost us a whopping $160.  Yep, that's right.  House red and white wines and appetizers, $160.  I knew this place was spendy, but call me crazy - that seems a little ridiculous!  When we left, I did not feel fulfilled.\n\nService was good once we finally got some attention - took awhile for someone to greet us and speak to us once we were seated.   Also, the seating area is pretty cramped.  You end up nearly sitting in your neighbor's lap.  That said, I must apologize to our next door table neighbors, who had to put up with our inappropriate noise level and topics of conversation on what was clearly their date night.  \n\nSo in summary, if you want to check out this buzz worthy spot and shell out for your food, go for it.  It's creative, innovative, \"interesting\"...but I would pass - there are lots of other great restaurants in San Francisco where you can get better value and better food for your money.  I most likely will not revisit Commonwealth.", "author": "Jenna C."}

What does \"commonweath\" mean?\n\ncommonwealth\n* An independent country or community, esp. a democratic republic\n* An aggregate or grouping of countries or other bodies\n* A community or organization of shared interests in a nonpolitical field\n- the Christian commonwealth, - the commonwealth of letters\n* A self-governing unit voluntarily grouped with the US, such as Puerto Rico\n* A formal title of some of the states of the US, esp.

The British monarch is the symbolic head of the Commonwealth\n* The general good\n\nI am going to assume they chose the name Commonwealth based on the general good. I understand they use the term \"progressive American\"  to describe the restaurant based on philanthropic goals of donation of $10 towards charity for every tasting menu ordered. This is very honorable in consideration and alone, worthy of another visit but somewhat hands-off in philanthropic ideals for San Francisco values, especially for the Mission.\n\nI came with a friend and we had the five course vegetarian tasting menu. Each course was a small serving of something amazing. I left very full.\n\nWe started with the homemade potato chips with nori seaweed served with a scary, salt & vinegar gelatinous foam (looks and feels like a male/sexy explosion in a cup). I could not handle the foam texture but my dining partner enjoyed it. \n\nFirst course was a mushroom soup with a relish topping. It was very tasty and had a beautiful smoky balance with good textures and flavors. Normally I am not big on smoky taste but I really enjoyed this. It was not too heavy as it seems most mushroom based soups are.  \n\nSecond course was smoked turnips with porcini mushrooms, snap peas and some other veggies under a cheese veil in a bed of creamy cheese sauce and covered in puffed puffed amaranth. This had a nice salty yet creamy flavor, felt very heavy but in a good way.\n\nThird course was fresh spring peas, yuba noodles, black trumpet crackling (textured like chicharr\u00f3n), silken tofu, coconut milk foam with thai spices. This course was a nice contrast to the other courses with the subtle Thai flavors and very light.\n\nFourth course was a cold squash & spring pea soup topped with thin slices of zucchini with a fried zucchini flower. I loved this course, they worked well together in flavor, temperature and in texture. Very fresh tasting.\n\nThe aperitif was a apricot sorbet in a bed of sparkling fruit juice- I was not a big fan of this. Very sweet, almost painfully so.\n\nFifth course was tonka bean frozen yogurt , with fresh strawberries and rhubarb anise strudel. I have no idea what a tonka bean is, but apparently it has little or no flavor. The frozen yogurt was nitrogen frozen so it basically shattered over the warm strudel and I really liked this texture combo. Also the strudel was pretty amazing on its own. This course was not in the normal tasting menu but they served us an extra on the house :)\n\nSixth course was peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, frozen popcorn, caramel in a bar. Basically its an upscale candy bar with this weird popcorn that sort of turned into a popcorn cream. I can't say this was my favorite either, it was good but the chocolate was extremely rich and I had serious problems eating this because the chocolate ganache was in a sort of cookie base and I could not for the life of me cut the bar, my cookie was too thick.

You should probably know that if one person wants to order it, the entire table has to as well. Welp, here we go.\n\nWe started off with an amuse bouche of seaweed and mushroom, but it wasn't quite finished in one bite. Nothing memorable.

Nice and fresh, small portion.\n\nFollowing the abalone salad was the Jerusalem artichoke with red quinoa, quail egg, hay, and chickweed. Loved the texture of it all, and was it the artichoke that was fried?

Quail shaped into perfect medallions with skin still on (how?) with vanilla foam went surprisingly well.  All the wine pairings complimented the dishes very well and came with some great background from the sommelier.  She even gave us a very large pour so we would have some extra to accompany the sea urchin course we added.\n\nWe ended our meal with a palate cleansing green apple sorbet and then a dessert of peanut butter semifreddo and chocolate ganache, which was basically a high end chocolate bar which was seriously delicious.  Even my gf who usually has little room for dessert finished hers.\n\nThe service was attentive, informative, and most importantly - the opposite of stuffy.\n\nIn terms of the creativity and interesting food, I would put Commonwealth up there with the likes of Coi, if you keep in mind Commonwealth is probably a fraction of the price.  The difference being you can goto Commonwealth in a t-shirt and jeans and skip some of the stuffiness if you wish.  I would put Commonwealth in the same vein as Sons & Daughters, which is another one of our favorites in the city.", "author": "Chris T."}

Every dish was ingredient-focused, playful, and utterly delicious.\n\nWe lucked out last minute when a coworker couldn't make their Friday night reservation. Wanting to try as many things as possible, but within our unprepared appetites, we opted to order a la carte.  The Summer Squash soup with vadouvan and squash blossoms was cool, vibrant, and could easily have been all mine if Jesse hadn't fought me spoonful by spoonful.  The mild curry flavor dressed up soup that was bright green in color and flavor.\n\nThe Tomatoes were a mystery until i discovered exactly what the smoked bread tasted like.  Wafer thin slices of crunchy bread had all the richness and subtle smokiness of a better beef jerky.  The highlight of the dish was balls of Idiazabal cheese.  This smoked sheep cheese is usually hard.  Commonwealth stretched it like Mozzarella, making soft, tender mouthfuls of sharp cheese.\n\nOctopus had a tender bite, and was also smokily charred.  The serving was also surprisingly filling given the price.  \n\nWe only ordered the Semifreddo because the chatty, middle-aged man at the next table--dining with his mom and most of the way through his wine pairing--was profusely thanking our waitress for suggesting it.  Like a chocolate bar, it was a crunchy cookie, topped with smooth peanut butter ice cream, and wrapped in thin chocolate.  This is the candy bar that beat up Snickers and put its shoe print on Snickers' butt.  And it's served with frozen popcorn.  Salty, buttery, strangely reminiscent of fresh, fluffy popcorn, and completely fun to eat.\n\nThe entire meal made me want to go home and start experimenting.  6 dishes, 3 glasses of wine for 105 before tax and tip.", "author": "Laura S."}

No \n\nTalk about a disappointment! I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally my friends who are visiting from LA were able to get a reservation. Okay, Commonwealth, I want to see what you are made of. \n\nFriday after work, this was my meal is take my mind off a long week at work. What did I get, FISHY FISH. \n\nWell, thanks, I didn't sign up for bad fish, and really, if you don't know the 101 of how to prepare raw fish, then you shouldn't offer it or even highlight it on a tasting menu. I mean, if I want bad fish, I would pay $5 for bad sashimi at a sushi restaurant. \n\nThe amuse bouche is a slice of red snapper served in a clay bowl. When the bowl was place in front of me, the whiff of fish smell made me almost gag. Given that I am kindna picky about my fish, and only would eat at a few sushi places. I wanted to point out that any liquid under raw fish will instantly fouled the fish, and serving it in such large bowl instead of a plate also trap that foul smell. As I held my nose, and ate the fish, it was neither cut correctly (chewy) or tasty (bland due to lack of freshness and garnish). \n\nThe tuna tartar with ikura and a hydrogen freeze horse radish cream cover, interesting presentation. The fish is okay, too much ikura made it too salty and fishy. \n\nCold spring squash soup with thinly sliced squash, and one fried squash flower is the best dish of the night. The batter is a bit too thick, so I bite into a bit too much grease. \n\nThe main meat dish is pork with something, not too memorable. \n\nDessert is a chocolate covered peanut butter bar, fancy but too sweet and only have one texture, thick. I almost hack the plate in half. \n\nWine pairing was great. \n\nThe value is not bad considering with pairing, it came out to be about $120 per person. \n\nMoral of the story, there is a reason why the Japanese sushi chef had to be apprentice for at least 3 years before messing with the fish! Don't try too hard that you forgot the essence of a good meal is the taste, not presentation and how many tricks you used. \n\nMaybe I didn't order the right thing, but I don't have enough courage to wait another eternity for a chance of getting bad food.", "author": "Alice C."}

I mean come on, where else can you go for a 6 course tasting menu for $65???\n\nOur meal came with an amuse bouche, which was basically a fritter, filled with a chowder sauce and paired with a clam. It was tasty, but was slightly overpowered by a smokey bacon flavor.\n\nThe 1st course was one of our favorites. Textures of potato, which included caviar, purple potatoes, fresh herbs, and creme fraiche. There was a nice balance of textures, savoriness, and brightness from the herbs.\n\nThe 2nd course was the pan seared foie gras with rhubarb compote on brioche, accompanied  with a simple salad with pickled onion. It was well executed and a nice change from the sometimes overly sweet items that are paired with foie gras. \n\nThe 3rd course was the Jerusalem artichoke salad with onions cooked with hay (which from our point of view, did not really bring much to the table), quinoa, and quail egg. Beautiful presentation, and we were over all satisfied with the salad, especially with the tasty fried artichokes.\n\n4th course was venison with kale, turnip and a maple syrup sauce. It was pretty well balanced but the venison was slightly tough to cut, which probably was due to being slightly underdone. \n\nThe two desserts which were the blood orange sorbet with chantily cream and peanut butter semifreddo with chocolate ganache and freeze dried popcorn were an excellent way to end the meal. The sorbet being a nice palate cleanser, and the the semifreddo being whimsy and tasty at the same time. Complimentary truffles at the end of the night were the icing on the cake.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful and we especially like how all of the servers (including the host) shared responsibilities of taking care of the tables. The ambiance of the restaurant is intimate but still lively, with a minimalist interior. \n\nIn the end, we were pleased with our experience at Commonwealth and having shared our special night there.

Instead, I was underwhelmed. The homemade lemonade was decent but rather tart. The kale appetizer was very creative yet bitter and salty. The sturgeon looked very nice and was very tender but it lacked taste and the breaded covering didn't do much for it. The breaded cod fish, on the other hand, was excellent and so was the sauce that came with it.\n\nYou can easily rack up a huge bill since you really need one appetizer and two main dishes per person (not to mention alcohol). \n\nI realize that my taste buds are a subjective measure and so take this rating with a grain of salt (pun intended).

In fact, I considered giving the place just two-stars -- when a place charges over $100 per person--   I expect more. However, there were a few positives...  and we had a great time despite the restaurant's shortcomings. So, grade inflation: three stars.\n\nI cannot review the restaurant, just our meal.\n\nTo start with the positives: the uni and trout roe composition that opened my meal was phenomenal. That dish was everything the restaurant promises to be: the highlight of the night and something truly memorable among the thousands of bites of food I've put in my mouth over the last several months.  In addition, the service was good (if unspectacular) and the  wine -- a Friulian white-- was fantastic.  \n\nHowever, the rest of the night did not live up to that opening salvo. The second 'warm' course  (yellow foot chantarelles with shitake dumplings) was competent but unexciting. The third, 'hot' courses were bizarrely insipid. I ordered a pork jowls and found three smallish pieces of insipid pork spread across a large plate. My girlfriend ordered 'Hen poached in almond milk', which somehow sounded good on the menu, but which basically tasted like boiled chicken. My father ordered a piece of Hake about the size of a largish sardine. The portions were ridiculously small. We all went home slightly hungry.\n\nIn short, the food was a serious let down and that is clearly what this place is all about.  The decor, as well, does not shout 'high end', although it is comfortable enough. However, the company, which is clearly the most important thing in any meal, was great.

Commonwealth offers small plates in two forms: a tasting menu (preselected 8-course menu, also available with wine pairings) or a la carte. Between my boyfriend and I we chose 5 dishes from the a la carte menu: the sea urchin, beef tartare, squid and pork belly, petrale sole, and the young hen.\n\n-Sea urchin, corn and tapioca fritter, coastal succulents, cucumber, tomato water granita ($16). Didn't know what to expect before ordering this, but this was one of my favorite dishes we ordered. The slew of different textures and temperatures threw me off at first with the ice cold tomato water granita, chilled cucumber, and warm sea urchin and fritter, but the crispness of the granita and cucumber were an excellent pairing with the lightly crisp fritter and soft sea urchin.\n\n-Beef tartare, salted blackberries, elderflower capers, chervil, kefir, pumpernickel tuile ($16). This restaurant was spot on with their attention to detail. I've never had elderflower capers in a dish- not that it added much flavor, but it was certainly a nice touch. The small amount of sauces provided for this dish made it stand out from your typical beef tartare, but after being blown away by the flavors of the sea urchin, the beef tartare's taste wasn't as full. Overall, good.\n\n-Squid and pork belly, soft boiled egg, hay smoked potatoes, pickled onions, fine herbs ($15). OUR FAVORITE. This dish was absolutely amazing. Both cooked and served warm, the squid and pork belly were seasoned perfectly. Since I've only had pork belly prepared in Asian restaurants, I didn't know pork belly could be seasoned any other way. The squid was tender, as well. The surprise of the dish was the hay smoked potatoes- they were a bit salty, but worked with the dish since the pickled onions weren't as pickled as I expected. And finally, the dollop of aioli or some similar sauce, really set off the flavors in this dish. Five stars for this dish- DELISH.\n\n-Petrale sole, steamed in a fig leaf, beans, zucchini, faro verde, basil, pine nut cream ($16) and young hen, burnt eggplant, tomato, carolina gold rice, smoked chile sauce ($14). As our waitress pointed out, the items increase in temperature as you go further down. They served them in the same order in which they are listed on the menu, which meant the sole and hen were last. The sole was great, with a strong pesto taste covering the beans. The zucchini was crispy, reminding me of a tempura-fried vegetable. Again, a fabulous combination of tastes that seamlessly fused together. The dish didn't feel heavy, which was a wonderful end to our meal. Conversely, I was a little disappointed with the hen. The hen itself was fine (cooked with a very slight breadcrumb-like crust), but the cold gelatin-like scoop of who-knows-what did my palate so wrong. It threw the dish off completely for me and made me miss the taste of the sole.\n\nWe did not indulge in dessert, but it looked great from what we saw at the table next to us. I also remember the woman next to us telling her date \"This is the best dessert I've ever had.\" So have at it if you're still hungry! We left comfortably full and experienced flavor combinations we've never explored before.

All of the food was really beautiful looking, but some of it didn't live up to its beautiful presentation. Foie gras was good, but not the best I've ever had (I think it was a little overcooked since it had a little bit of that grainy, liver texture). Sweetbreads were okay. Radish and carrot salad was simple, but very tasty. Blood orange sorbet was wonderful, and the peanut butter semifreddo was much better than I thought it was going to be since I'm not usually a fan of super sweet desserts nor am I a fan of popcorn, but the dessert was not too sweet, and the popcorn did not stick to my teeth (which is what I hate about popcorn).\n\nDecor is nice, but it had one of my major pet peeves: close together tables! When I am enjoying a nice meal, I don't want my table to be right next to the other table. Getting out of a booth seat is extremely awkward since you have to squeeze in between your table and your neighbor's table.", "author": "Wendy S."}

They tend to fall apart so that you end up tasting one thing at a time. The only stand-out was the squid. \nToo many staff for the small restaurant, and at the end you walk out with a price tag close to $100/person. \nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend this place because you pay too much for a wannabe fancy plate - it doesn't live up to the price.", "author": "R K."}

We very rarely drop $100 on dinner for two, but it was definitely a treat. Yes, the portions are small. I contend that small portions keep the magic happening dish after dish. \n\nNotes: just a couple blocks from BART.\n\nWe opted out of the tasting menu, since we were more intrigued by the A la carte items (and know that I live for dessert). \n\nHere's a summary of what we enjoyed: \n\nDINNER\n\nhomemade meyer lemon soda - PERFECT. would totally recommend. not too sweet, perfectly refreshing, delicious. got a note of fennel (which i usually hate) but it was divine.\n\nshaved radish and carrots, goat cheese, etc - super light, fresh, and perfect as a starter.\n\nslow cooked egg, mint bread pudding, mushroom - beautiful plating, interesting flavors, notable notes were the mushroom. I would not call the green fluff \"mint bread pudding' but whatever floats your boat!\n\npork shoulder- so flavorful, so good. can't even remember other components of dish.  this pork was moist, perfectly cooked, and a great bite. \n\ntrout, hollandaise, ferns - my favorite dish. the trout was SO CRISPY. ferns were whimsical and delicious (had never had them).\n\nDESSERT:\n\nstrawberries, basil, macadamia nuts, buckwheat cake, tonga bean ice cream - the ice cream was the best part of this - so amazing. everything was light and tasty, which exception of choice of buckwheat... I didn't hate it, but it was definitely a strange choice for the cake. it was dry-ish.\n\npeanut butter semifreddo, gross \"frozen popcorn\", WAY salty caramel - my boyfriend adored the semifreddo (I'm not a fan of rich chocolate/pb desserts), but all the other components were awful. The \"frozen popcorn\" was not popcorn but a pile of maltodextrin or some other gastronomical creation and not palatable. I adore salted caramel, but this caramel was SO salty.\n \nyogurt mousse, pistachio crumble, and hibiscus rubbish - the mousse and crumble were like sex in my mouth - amazing! the hibiscus gelee tasted like I was  wasting my time. \n\nThe stars of dessert were all stars, but the accompaniments were rubbish.\n\nDinner was lovely, service was lovely, and I would recommend for a culinary adventure.", "author": "Andrea B."}

I've eaten it, made it, worked it, done the restaurant thing, front and back - I've made this kind of food and waxed poetic tableside too -  I'm a believer through and through. \n\nBut the food has to be delicious. No amount of graceful language, technical plating (or intentional absence of it), ambition, 'pushing bounderies' or neighborhood agenda can substitute for deliciousness. One or two things tasted quite good but the majority of the meal was not delicious. I'm writing this without the menu in front of me. I realize how much we eat words just as we do food when dining out. I also admit I'm rating this place along the scale of fine-dining where your expectations are essentially limitless.\n\namuse #1: raw fish, underseasoned, with raw radish in a pool of citrus syrup. A cold, unpalatable way to start and a complete miss for me. Mouth not amused.\n\namuse #2: veloute of root vegetable with vanilla and hazelnut. Warm, creamy and flavorful, this was like a savory latte. A standard amuse but successful because it works most of the time: creamy soup opens you up for more. I enjoyed this.\n\n1. crab with coconut milk and lime: sweet, clean, juicy fresh crab meat. This was my favorite course by far. Simple and clean flavors that tasted great together. \n\n2. sea urchin and caviar: with excruciatingly piled but essentially non-contributory garnishes of puzzling and suspect motive. Another complete miss for me. I'm happy with an uni and an ikura squatting together cheerfully on a tiny plate, so maybe this dish was over my head. But I was confused. What is supposed to be happening here?\n\n3. slow-cooked egg with pumpkin raviolies and mushroom broth: I get why a soft egg is like a required course in the study of tasting menus.  It's a seriously challenging and versatile ingredient. In many ways a miss here tells the whole story. One stroke with my spoon and I had soupy yolk and pearly, nearly raw egg white slipping about, admixing with pale bland broth. Then the essentially flavorless raviolies with pasta that did not taste fresh. You know fresh pasta when you taste it. God it's so good. Not here. And then, an albeit beautiful but raw shave of white mushroom floating like a styrofoam raft in still jacuzzi water.  Perhaps I've been palate-cleansed by east coast aggressiveness with seasoning, which is very likely - but this didn't taste like anything to me and the components did not mate.\n\n4. turbot with black truffles, brussel sprout leaves and a celery root puree. The fish was perfectly cooked, tender and delicate, fragrantly paired with woody truffles. Truffles usually help a dish. Like salt or parmesan upon the otherwise flavorless. The brussel sprout and celery root combination is a dependable base for a dish. You could put most protein on it and be okay. So this was a relative success.\n\n5. citrus palate cleanser: lemon curd with little green tea merengues and thin sections of persimmon. I loved the lemon curd, it was tangy and refreshing. I also liked the green tea merengues. I love persimmons but here they were like plastic. The question though, is why put these three foods together? Each with such assertive, well-defined textures:  I've been thinking about this for a day now. Trying to get to the heart of it. It's not that a dish has to be like a matching outfit. In fact you want something unexpected and unique to pull it altogether. Vanilla and hazelnut added to a root vegetable veloute, that was delicious. This dish however is like one of those outfits where you wear all the season's 'hottest trends' all at once with no regard to the texture or style of the fabric you're wearing. Perhaps 'In fashion' but trying too hard and missing the point.  \n\n6. chocolate ganache cake with ice cream and caramel: the ganache portion was silky, delicious chocolate success. the cake part may be a new trend in bitter burnt cake flavor that I haven't picked up on yet but I kind of scraped off the ganache portion and ate that, leaving the cake part alone because it was unpleasant. Oh well. \n\nI had a wonderful time at dinner and both my companions loved their meal. It was a nice experience to be utterly spoiled like this, but the food wasn't delicious to me even though I really wanted it to be.", "author": "Sharon W."}

The squid and pork belly -- I'm not usually a fan of fatty meat, but this was so flavorful and aromatic that it was the best part of the dish.  The pork shoulder were tenderloin slices that were cooked just right, with accompanying sweet turnips.  The duck was also quite good (can't remember much about it other than it was a sizeable portion because by that time, I was meated out).  The peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, carmel, and frozen popcorn was a bit disappointing - sort of like a glorified twix bar.

Over the months I had been patiently waiting to lock down a reservation and finally after a bit of wait, I had my first meal here this past week. When I sat down afterward to write my review, however, I found myself discussing not just the meal, but also the progressive evolution in dining and how it resonates with the second decade of this millennium we're entering. As a result, it was an exceedingly long post. So, in an effort to make it less overwhelming, I decided to split my original post in two. In this post, I will provide my review of the restaurant and the second post will be focused on the evolution of dining and techniques.\n\nExecutive Chef, Jason Fox and Chef de Cuisine, Ian Muntzert, are two of the four working partners at Commonwealth. These two Bar Tartine alums have put together a polished and solid menu, so solid that within less than a year of opening, it has taken on a pacesetting status above restaurants in its category. After dining here and deciphering its quality, flavors, techniques and cost, I understand the hype and much of it is due to Fox's gastronomy experimental bent showcasing his edge and originality. Every single dish I had here at Commonwealth was intriguing. It is very rare that I am dazzled or even be exposed to anything unique when it comes to food I've had over a million times, yet Fox and Muntzert managed to break that.\n\nUpon entrance, the first thing thatstruck me was how small the space was. With tables that seats no more than a party of 4 and the bar counter that could possibly snuggle about 10 diners facing the open kitchen, this place gets cramped. The sophisticated, clean and minimalist decor evokes a casual and intimate atmosphere. Another thing that struck me after reviewing the Tasting and A la carte menu were the low the price points per dish. $60 for tasting ($10 is donated to a local charity) and the A la carte dishes ranges from $6 - $15. We decided to skip the tasting and ordered the a la carte and try some of Fox's signature dishes.\n\nThey started us off with the complimentary chips with the right amount of salt and malt vinegar in the dip.\n\nFirst up: Porcini churros, thyme, huckleberry jam\n\nCame with three somewhat curled pieces of fried dough, light and airy complimented with the huckleberry jam. This reminded me of funnel cakes, but lighter and less bold in taste.\n\nFoie Gras covered in chocolate quince with vanilla simple syrup and foie gras powder\n\n***Note: this is not on the menu***\nThey were out of the Slow Cooked Farm Egg that evening (one of\ntheir signature dishes) so I was quite bummed, but luckily Fox sent\nus the foie gras from the tasting menu.\n\nThis was the perfect compromise dish. It was a ball of dark chocolate that melted away in seconds with the buttery salted taste of foie gras. The marriage of the dark chocolate and salted foie gras is absolutely fantastic, it was smooth and creamy in texture, and very rich in depth. Per the Sommelier's suggestion, this dish was paired with 1998 Domaine Fontanel Rivesaltes Ambre. The wine itself is complex, sweet with caramelized golden flavor with essence of dried fruit and light spice, it was the perfect pairing as it helps cut the fat of foie gras.\n\nSea urchin, sweet potato tempura, chrysanthemum leaf, shiso, scallion, yuzu kosho\n\nThese exquisite sweet bulbs....\n\nFull article at http://triplexbexx.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/commonwealth-evolution-of-dining-part-1/", "author": "Rebecca L."}

The interior is rustic and clean, the service is hand-and-foot attentive, and the food is so obviously well thought out.  They love using flavored foams, which are the beautiful shiny bubbles that are a pretty addition to your dish. You can choose a small plate from each section, so about 3-4 total, which is usually enough for one person. I really enjoyed the nori chips with malt vinegar foam, which they give you when you arrive.  \n\nWe ordered the chicken tsukune, which are small, seasoned chicken meatballs, and they were hugely flavorful and one of my favorite dishes.  The eggplant in various forms was very bland, and really tasted like.. nothing, so I would not recommend that.  The sea urchin with kimchee, tapioca, and seaweed brioche was my second favorite, and the tapioca was almost like caviar because of the texture and the rich sea urchin taste on top.  The slow cooked egg with padron peppers and pickled chanterelles were all very delicate flavors that went together well.  The scallops with squid cracker (black shrimp chip) and yuzu emulsion were tender and heavenly.  Last but not least, we had the peanut butter semifreddo, which is a peanut butter icecream mixed with whipped cream and placed inside a paper thin dark chocolate shell and had a crust on the bottom, making it the smoothest, most badass icecream bar in America.  Thank you, Commonwealth, I'll be back!", "author": "Terry K."}

Every dish on the table had at least some \"holy cow\" component where it was difficult to wrap your head about how the preparation was done.\n\nThe meal started out on a high note. A bright, fruity cava and amuse started us off on a sweet note, with plenty of fruit and light flavors. The albacore crudo was gorgeously presented on a slate rock, with surprising hazelnut crumbs nestled in the folded albacore. \n\nThe summer melon was the hit of the evening for us. The melon was incredibly prepared, with slivers of jalapeno providing a subtle peppery heat and tiny, normally humble, cucumber slices bearing a myriad of flavor. The oyster plate up next was scrumptious, with tiny \"grains\" of bacon sneaking onto every fork-full. \n\nBut then dinner took a sour turn. The sweetbreads were a critical miss on the menu, memorable mostly in how it fell so far short of the rest of the menu. The sorbet was delicious, but unpaired and unworthy of taking up a previous spot on the tasting menu. \n\nThe dessert - a peanut butter semifreddo - was a wonderful way to end the evening, particularly when paired with a fortified and aged grenache blanc. Without the dessert, I would have been disappointed.\n\nOne interesting observation I had was how...empty the kitchen was. Only a few people were running around the mostly open back area when we departed at 7:30. I'm not sure what it means, but the contrast with the standing-room-only kitchen at Coi made an impression\n\nUltimately, I'm glad I came here. However, although I received a unique technical experience, I felt a bit shortchanged on the culinary experience. 3.5 stars.", "author": "Gregory S."}

I had the chicory mousse for dessert, which was especially interesting because up until that point I had only been very vaguely aware that chicory was a thing. Like, I'm pretty sure I had heard the word before, but that would have been the extent of my knowledge. If you had pressed me, I probably would have told you it was some kind of aromatic shrub used in scented candles and perfumes. If I was feeling particularly full of BS, I probably would have thrown something in about how it was highly poisonous when ingested in even small amounts.\n\nTurns out it's a woody, perennial herbaceous plant usually with bright blue flowers--rarely white or pink--cultivated for salad leaves, chicons, or for roots, which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive. It also makes for a really interesting and tasty mousse at Commonwealth. Who'da thunk?\n\nOther things!\n\nOK, so you might have gotten from the above that I enjoyed the food. I did! But if I were only rating the food, I think I'd probably only give Commonwealth 4 stars. So why did I go with 5? Well! Let me tell you!\n\n1) Reservations: SUPER SIMPLE! The night before, I got a reservation for two at 6pm. Contrast this to other trendy places in the city where you can't even pull that sort of thing off if you plan it a month in advance.\n\n2) Ambiance: SUPER GREAT! Lively but not loud. Small but not cramped. Classy but unpretentious. Just really clean and straightforward.\n\n3) Service: SUPER AWESOME! Our server was awesome and informative and had good opinions on things. She also had a really sweet tattoo on her arm. +1 for sweet tats!\n\nAnd honestly, given the quality of the service and food, it was very reasonably priced.\n\nThis sort of stuff adds up. I've been to a few other places in the city that might have comparably good food, but actual experience is kind of a headache (because it's too busy or too loud or too whatever), to the extent that I don't expect I'll ever make it to them again.

There were some things on the a la carte list calling my name though, so I opted out (next time!). Our super nice server recommended getting 2-3 dishes per person, so after much hemming and hawing, I settled on these:\n\n-Arancini with truffle cheese and lettuce cream: Good, but pretty standard arancini. Where was the truffle taste?\n\n-Pumpkin salad with asian pear, chicory, idiazabal cheese, almond tuile, cocoa nib: Surprisingly bland, considering the ingredients :(\n\n-Butter poached hen, savoy cabbage, black trumpets, rutabaga, vanilla: Winner winner chicken dinner! This dish was certainly on par with the caliber of cooking I expected from Commonwealth.  \n\n-Dessert: Can't remember what it was called, but it looked a whole lot better than it tasted.\n\nIn addition to a carrot dish with sprouting broccoli, yuba, puffed buckwheat, coconut milk, and thai spices and an exciting sorbet that were on the menu, the folks in the kitchen were sweet to whip up a super tasty vegan \"ragu\" to accommodate my man's meatless/dairyless dietary restrictions.

Three months ago, I took my wife and 13 year old son to Commonwealth for his birthday dinner-  we ordered the tasting menu..  My son is interested in cooking and has been playing around with the so-called \"molecular gastronomy\" techniques that he has seen on the TV cooking shows.   Okay we are over indulgent parents, but this is what my son, who aspires to be a chef (at least for now,) is really interested in.  He was unbelievably excited in the way that a parent wants to see their kid excited and curious and open to new experiences.  It was a super big deal-  we've never taken my son out  to eat at anywhere with close to this level of refinement and quality.\n\nLove was just not in the house that evening.  Three big issues:\n\n1)  in the 4th  course my son found WRITHING WORMS in his fish  The fish had been \"cooked\" sous vide, but apparently not enough to kill the (many) parasites.  At first we thought my son was mistaken when he said he found worms, but the fish was absolutely TEAMING with them.  My wife and I had finished ours. Yuck.\n2)  The dishes we ate ranged from good to some just eh to a few not good. \n3)  This is just a matter of palette, but while everything was incredibly beautiful, and displayed obvious off the hook creativity and refined and honed technique, nothing we ate was amazing and flavors seemed muted.  Again a matter of preference but NOTHING was drop dead delicious.  (service though was very top notch)\n\nMy son was a trooper, willing to proceed with the  \"replacement\" course and then onto another but about 20 mins later, he felt sick to his stomach and went to the bathroom and vomited. He was quite ill either from the food or maybe just the thought of the food, but we were done for the evening.\n\nWe left immediately.   The restaurant was gracious, insisting on picking up the (considerable) check.  We left a suitably generous tip for the nice servers who obviously were not to blame.  Friends in the business have told us that worms are present in a lot of fish.  That said....\n\n....months later my son won't go near fish.  I think that the restaurant obviously focuses on brilliant technique applied to the exotic and sophisticated choices.  I believe that they are very serious and proud of their craft..  Somehow though, they seem to have lost focus on the basics:  making really good, delicious food that is acceptable to eat. Pretty basic stuff.\n\nWhy am I writing this months later? A friend was just speaking of f the place and I was reminded of that evening.   Ultimately  what really bothered me:  Commonwealth never contacted us afterward to see how my son, who was served wormy fish and vomited in their restroom,  was faring.  They had our phone info. The likely type of worms present could have been a pretty major issue mandating medical treatment- like having you pet de-wormed.  Shame on Commonwealth.\n\nAnd a shame I'll never eat here againe-  too far out of the acceptable area.", "author": "Zachary F."}

It wasn't a matter of having too high of an expectation. I was actually cautious about trying Commonwealth having read that it's been compared to Manresa and Coi; haven't been to Coi, but am not a fan of Manresa. It was really a case of reasonable expectation not met.\n\nI was glad that the dishes were more real than Manresa's. We went with the a la carte options..maybe the foamy, progressive style is reserved for the tasting menu. At first we ordered 4 dishes, but the waitress warned us that it may not be enough, so we added 1 more. They recommend each person to order 3 dishes if you go a la carte, but we learned that the portion size is really not all that small.\n\nChickpea panisse came in 5 large sticks. They had a smooth, almost custard-like interior and slick, crispy crust..not oily at all. Gnocchi were light and soft, and there's more than enough to share for 2 people. Sea urchin and sweet potato tempura didn't come across as an integrated dish. Later I learned that it was yuzu kosho (a fermented pickle comprising the rind of the aromatic yuzu fruit, salt, and either red or green chilies) that made the sea urchin spicy, and I wasn't crazy about that. I like my sea urchin fresh. For entrees we got duck breast and lamb breast, and both were disappointing. The duck breast was chewy, and the lamb breast consisted mostly of fat. \n\nWe shared frozen coconut mousse, and were glad we decided to order dessert.

B&B is warm, cozy and inviting, but styled perfectly for its Pacific Heights location. Both very pleasing.\n\nService at both is friendly, accommodating, very well-informed and crisp. B&B service is perfect and invisible. Commonwealth service is perfect and a little more earnest: our server seemed to know every detail about the food, wine and decor, and he was anxious to share.\n\nFood was the defining difference. The menu at B&B is less avant garde. No foams, gelees or exotic Asian ingredients. The presentation is more straightforward. But every element in every dish was perfectly selected, cooked and seasoned.\n\nAt Commonwealth, while it was a wonderful dinner, the corn in my slow-cooked egg and corn salad was starchy and flavorless. I can get sweet, tasty corn at Safeway, three for a buck. The salad could have been magical. Instead it was just really good. The sea urchin appetizer was quite perfect, and the hen was perfectly roasted, but both lacked salt and pepper. They get the big things right, but miss simple details.\n\nI will return and hope for perfection the second time around.", "author": "David G."}

Woohoo!\n\n\nSAVORY = Almost awesome. \n\nRunning theme of the night seemed to be that everything I would not have ordered ended up better than what I would have with limited selections. \n\nComplementary chips = Not all that. Tasted like Lay's chips with a cool sauce. Wish I wasn't so hungry, would've eaten less of it. \n\nSmoked Mussels =  Would not normally get this, but it turned out to be one of the best dishes of the night. Good mix with cannellini beans and excellent with the deep fried and super crispy chicken skin. Awesome. \n\nPork Belly = Good, but not the best dish of the night. Crispy outside, soft and juicy fattiness without feeling too fatty. Pears were crispy and juicy and perfect, shaped in spheres. \n\nLamb's Tongue = Had eyed this on the menu, but it turned out not to be as good as I had hoped. I love tongue, but this was prepped like unsauced lengua that was put in a terrine like shape and crisped on the outside. Could have used some liquid. \n\nButter Poached Hen = One of the top 2 dishes of the night. The hen was soft (white meat portion at that) and juicy and buttery. What's not to like? \n\n\nDESSERTS. Satisfactory, but not awesome. \n\nCarrot sorbet = Unsweetened sorbet, so it tasted very strongly of carrot. Sweetness came from the rest of the dish, especially from the ultra sweet dates, which was the best part of the dish. It's pretty good without the sorbet, but the coolness rounds it out. \n\nPeanut Butter Semifreddo = Wife loved it. Tasted like a fancy Snickers ice cream bar. She would order it again. \n\nChikory Cream, Bananas and Brulee = Enjoyed it, although wouldn't order again. The chickory was the best party. Would have liked the bananas to have been cooked.\n\nVERDICT = Will come back again, especially if we can't find parking around the block.", "author": "David G."}

Don't ask. Just do. And scoop up as much of that huckleberry jam as possible.\n\n- Kabocha pumpkin, kale, coconut milk, peanut. Alone? Perhaps not so epic. Together? Epic.\n\n- Ocean trout crudo. Beautiful looking. Beautiful tasting.\n\n- Duck confit crepe with a mini salad of persimmon, walnut and pomegranate. Blow my mind why don't you. Best dish of the night.\n\n(note: culinary bliss achieved. the rest is just pure gravy.)\n\n- Grilled lamb cheeks, oh so subtly accented with sweet carrots and cauliflower. Ah, just like the best DJs, mind blown again! Best. Lamb. Ever. Let it melt in your mouth. Let it!\n\n - Finale: the cinnamon mille-feuille (cake) with house marshmallow and honey ice cream that the San Francisco Chronicle's Michael Bauer mentioned in his review. I will now mention it. Forever.\n\nLibations: A red Zweigelt wine from Austria. Reasonable priced. Recommended by our waitress. Splendid.\n\nSpace. As gorgeous as the food. Unpretentious. Confident. Bustling. Accessible.

However, at one point when I mentioned I was not that happy with a wine pairing (as we were having the tasting menu with matched wines) but I still liked the dish it self, the sugary \"oh thank you\" response was a put-off.\n\nNear the end our meal (just dessert left to come), a friend who had flown in from out of town came to join us, he sat beside me at the communal bench at the edges, and the staff immediately came over and said he can't sit there \"because\". We had already asked if we could move to an unoccupied larger table and was told no. They took him to a place at the bar. I complained to who seemed to be the evening service manager and she said we could move to the empty table after all, which was too little too late.\n\nWe had already witnessed earlier in the night, the same manager being attentive to an older gentleman sitting beside us, who complained about his main, so it was comped for him and he also was given a free dessert. It was shocking to see such disparity in treatment, obviously it was done as the older gentleman is some radio personality and we are \"nobody special\" in their books.\n\nWe live in Russian Hill and dine out often there and in other areas, and this is the first time in SF we have experienced such unaccommodating treatment. This includes walking into both Bar Tartine and Chotto with no reservations and getting seated.\n\nNow, on to the food:\n- fois gras bon bons. All we could taste was the chocolate and apple\n- salad of radish \"in many forms\", which turns out to mean either shaved or pickled\n- asparagus with custard and sea urchin, which is incredibly tasty but had the aforementioned poor wine paring\n- young hen, which is still \"chicken\" and at least tasted not dry, but it is not on the regular menu, so why am I eating it with the tasting menu?\n- blood orange sorbet with fennel foam, lovely amuse but no wine with it!\n- some kind of chocolate ganache and peanut butter that was far too sweet\n\nI will not be returning there!", "author": "Heather P."}

The Gnocchi came stinking to high-heaven in truffle oil...always a good thing.  The perfectly cooked egg gave the dish that wonderful richness that I always enjoy.  \n\nBoth the seafood courses I had were wonderful - the sea urchin and scallops. The sea urchin got a bit lost if you had it with too much sweet potato, so I suggest cutting back on a bit of the potato that is given.  Scallops were wonderful and went perfect with the Chenin Blanc I was having.  \n\nDesert was one of the best I've had in a long time - lemon sponge cake with thyme ice cream.  This is one of those deserts for those who like savory.  They did not hold back on the thyme and I praised them for doing so.  I ended up going out on a limb and having a red blemish ale, slightly sour, to pair with this - ended up being a very good call and a perfect night cap to the meal. \n\nService was excellent and all the wines I had were tasty.   Overall felt it was a very good value. \n\nAnd now the lows:\nBoth our meat courses were the lows of the evening.  Not sure what happened.  We got the duck and lamb.  In both, the first sign of my displeasure was that my knife was not sharp enough for both meats.  Both meats should be very tender, so it was frustrating to have difficulty cutting them.  The duck didn't look overcooked, but it certainly didn't have a medium rare mouth feel and didn't melt in your mouth.  The lamb was also pretty tough and one of our pieces had lots of tendon.  To both dishes credit, all the accompaniments were excellent.", "author": "Josh M."}

Watching the dance that goes on in the tiny kitchen and the preparation was impressive! decor was hip/happening. Beautiful plating. Great prices for what they were putting out (lots of work went into every dish)\n\nstarted with chips with seaweed (lightly sprinkled on top) with malt vinegar mousse\n\nWe pretty much ordered what Vivian W ordered on 5/20/13, except we ordered the Pork Jowl and 3 desserts. \nI felt the best dish out of my 3 was the green strawberries salad. Initially I was scared the pollen would put me into an allergic reaction b/c i am allergic to lots of things, but then I figured that this would be immunotherapy. It tasted like a light indian spice... and it was a nice fennel and strawberry salad.\n\nThe \"risotto\" with sunflower seeds and asparagus was just too green and healthy. It could have used some bacon or some meat. I couldn't eat more than half and that was only to be polite b/c i can tell it took a lot of work and it was healthy for me...\n\nThe pork jowl - I haven't never ordered this before, perhaps they should ask the customer to make sure they know what they are ordering or perhaps they didn't want to insult people... but it is basically fat. Really well spiced fat, but really, i can't eat 3 cubes of fat. I ate all the edges but there was no meat there. =( I like meat.\n\nmy husband felt his best of 3 was the scallop ceviche, and he did like the short ribs (but who can go wrong with short ribs, right?)\nThe middle dish - peas was light but minimal flavor (he thought. I liked it much better than my sunflower seed \"risotto\" but only had 2 spoonfuls). The tapioca is what called to us but it was flavorless and didn't even add texture. perhaps the tapioca should have been more prepared \"al dente.\"\n\nthe desserts were GREAT!!! probably the best part and the only part I would return for. started with a free (yay!) celery sorbet with vegetable? jus.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-13", "description": "I applaud Commonwealth for offering progressive food at an affordable price, as well as donating a portion of their tasting menu to local non-profits. The dishes were well composed and creative, displaying a wide range of flavors and talent. Unfortunately, everything was *so* balanced that the essence of each dish was lost. There was so much going on that nothing really stood out. The dishes needed more focus and punch.\n\nPorcini Churros with Huckleberry Jam - These tasted much better than they looked (let's not discuss what they resembled). The flavor of the mushroom wasn't very prominent, but I enjoyed the warm bready/doughy churro with the tart huckleberry jam. \n\nGrilled Chicken Livers - This was my first experience with grilled chicken liver...the texture is much more stringy and definitely not as elegant as foie gras (duck liver). The flavor of the chicken liver was too strong and mineral-like when eaten on its own. However, it tasted a lot better when combined with the brown rice & black pepper crackers along with the pickled onions and herbs. \n\nSlow-cooked Farm Egg, Matsutake Mushrooms, Barley - More about experiencing the textures, as the flavors were quite subtle. I liked how the soft, creamy egg coated the salty mushrooms and the chewy barley...all washed down with a smooth dashi broth. \n\nKabocha Pumpkin, Black Kale, Yuba, Coconut Milk - A more refined version of pumpkin curry. The balls of pumpkin and strands of yuba were nicely cooked and coated with a slightly sweet and creamy curry foam. \n\nSweet Potato Tempura with Sea Urchin - Being obsessed with sea urchin, I was most looking forward to this dish. However, it ended up just being ok. The sea urchin wasn't that high quality, and I thought it should've been better incorporated into the dish instead of just laying next to the tempura. The spicy yuzu sauce had a nice kick though. \n\nSierra Mackerel on the Plancha, Smoked Potatoes - Least interesting dish of the evening. The fish was meaty and cooked well, but needed more seasoning and acidity...making it bland and boring. \n\nCinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, Burnt Honey Ice Cream - Very creative with a multitude of different flavors and textures. It was exciting and fun to eat each component separately and in different combinations. I really liked the cardamom marshmallow and the sweet burnt honey ice cream, especially with the candied cocoa nibs.\n\nThis was one of the rare meals where I didn't really have a favorite dish of the evening. The food was pretty good overall, but there was nothing that I loved. My dinner felt a little flat and left something to be desired. The tables are also really close together, and the space feels cramped. On the other hand, the service was great with knowledgeable and friendly waiters, and nothing on the menu was more than $15.\n\nTo sum it up, I wouldn't mind eating at Commonwealth again, but I also wouldn't miss it if I didn't either.\n\n***For pics of each dish, go to my blog link under my profile.***", "author": "Karin V."}

All three restaurants focus on eating local and fresh, and showcase a lot of creativity and versatility in the chef's cooking. What SF foodie doesn't enjoy a local farm fresh egg or some Santa Barbara uni? \n\nOpted in for the a la carte menu, four of us shared every single dish on the menu minus the meat portion (none of us are huge carnivores.) It was a great way to be able to try everything without suffering too much in the wallet or pant size. \n\n-chips and foamy dip: my dad commented that he likes La Mar's chips better. It's so comparing apples to oranges, but I kinda get what he is saying. I didn't think the free chips and dip added much to the meal other than filling us up. The potato chips just resembled what you'd get from a vending machine. \n\n-starters: Chickpea panisse definitely reminded me of the chickpea fritters from Frances (I liked Frances' better, sorry!). The texture is creamy and the sauce interestingly reminded me of Chinese bean sauce. Grilled chicken tsukune was surprisingly flavorful and tender. \n\n-salads: Asparagus was so fresh, so light, so juicy, and so good that it made everything else on the plate seemed superfluous. Radishes had great flavors and the plate is as pretty as the asparagus dish. It's like looking at an abstract painting---everything looks chaotic and yet harmonic at the same time, and the colors are so vibrant! \n\n-gnocchi: definitely can't go wrong with the gnocchi. My parents who don't venture out much in terms of trying new food finally recognized something that they are eating and happily enjoyed them. \n\n-farm fresh egg with quinoa. So subtle and so delicious. Definitely had the right texture and flavor working together. \n\n-marinated mackerel. Good flavors and the yogurt worked well with the cold fish. \n\n-sea urchin with sweet potato tempura. normally I love sea urchin, but I thought the sweet potato overpowered the delicate uni. You can't taste the subtle sweetness of uni which was a disappointment to me. \n\n-Charred octopus. I usually like the texture of octopus a lot but this dish was slightly too rubbery for me. The flavors could be a little more bold too. Black rice cracker was pretty awesome though, and I love the color it adds to the dish. \n\n-Scallops were nicely cooked and the coconut milk flavor was subtle but a great enhancer to the dish. \n\nWe didn't order dessert because we were all full, but they brought us the peanut butter semifreddo on the house because it was my mom's birthday. Very nice gesture. It was pretty good but nothing I'd go back to Commonwealth for. \n\nContrary to the delicate sizes of most dishes here, Four Barrel drip coffee came in a large mug. A nice way to finish the meal. \n\nPrice is so reasonable! For this caliber of food and the amount of work that goes into each dish (how many man hours does it take to plate one dish that has at least like 10 components??), our bill only ended up being $130 before tips for four people. \n\nLast thoughts: Commonwealth is great if you want to be wowed by the chef's playfulness and creativity and presentation is key to you. Not the best choice if you just want something homey. And definitely confusing if you bring people like my parents here who are more into traditional cooking and didn't recognize most of the ingredients they were tasting.", "author": "Candice B."}

I get \"new\" American, I get foams and I get innovation... but I did not find any of the flavor profiles or combinations served to be particularly interesting, let alone good.  \n\nWe wanted to order one a la carte meal and one tasting menu but were told we could not.  Okay...? We didn't care about the pacing (we explained this), we just wanted to taste as many different dishes as possible.  We have a baby and rarely get out to eat these days.  But whatever.  With that option off the table, we ended up doing a la carte.  \n\nI ordered the chicken livers, the beets and I don't even remember the last dish.  The chicken livers were well cooked, but screamed for more contrast.  The tiny shaving of onion did nothing to offset the richness of the livers.  The beets were lieterally like every other beet preparation I have tried but for the fact that they were served on a rock.  That is not innovative.  That is pointless.  If the chef is going for some aesthetic, make sure it makes sense.  Beets on a rock just lost me.  \n\nMy husband had the urchin dish and pork belldish.

The food here was the most lackluster and anti-climactic food I've had in a while; possibly because I've always heard good things about Commonwealth, but I really didn't see what the big deal was. And I've definitely had much much better food elsewhere.\n\nEach of the dishes we had were over-thought, complicated, overloaded with ingredients.... just too much going on sometimes. I feel like the effort was concentrated on the visual aesthetic of the plate, as opposed to the flavor. Yes, photos of their food are amazing, but it looks better than it tastes. This place has amazing potential, if they just simplify; they should take the same stance on their food as their minimal decor. \n\nThe Chicken Tsukune basically tasted like frozen Safeway meatballs on a stick. Although my friend argued they tasted like Pavilions brand. The Farm Egg dish was interesting and creative, but again too many things going on on the plate that I couldn't appreciate the beautiful egg that was the star of the show. We also got the squid dish, which was served on a bed of sauteed greens; spinach, I think. But it actually tasted like a bed of salt with a side of squid. Unbelievably salty... almost inedible. And lastly we got the Young Hen; again, completely anticlimactic. It was the blandest piece of chicken you have ever tasted. It was moist, however, and perfectly cooked, but absolutely zero flavor. To top it off, more than one dish on our table that night had the same cilantro/basil pesto sauce. \n\nThe thing I must give them credit for is the fact that their ingredients were top-notch; everything was amazingly fresh. Too bad they just didn't get seasoned or paired together properly. Our waiter was also very attentive so the service deserves a lot of praise - if it wasn't for the front of house, I don't know if this place could carry itself on food alone.", "author": "Tara H."}

The problem is there isn't anywhere to stand or have a drink in the mean time because all of the bar seating is used for dinner, also.  I did like the reasonable prices and the wine list was long and everything was under $60 or so.  It's nice to be able to have a selection of $40 wines.\n\nI don't remember the last time a place really wowed me and with Commonwealth on Michael Bauer's top 100, this wasn't it.  A couple of the dishes were delicious, but we didn't get the cool slate serving slabs that we saw in the pictures.\n\nMy razor clams were chewy and not cooked as well as I've had them before.  Really the problem for me was my 'main course' the hanger steak.  Hanger steak is such a great cut of meat, served very rare and tender; mine seemed like it had been cooked hours ago and looked like a pot roast.  \n\nI wouldn't go back, I wouldn't recommend it, it was much overrated and not worth the time or money.", "author": "Jared H."}

Yes, some may describe is a bland.  This is not about bold, bright, flamboyant or hearty flavors.  It's a quiet game of textures and temperatures.  You have to pay attention.  \n\nThe service is casual.  Though the food is sophisticated, this is not a formal dining experience.  However, the hosts, the bartender, and the servers were very friendly and attentive.  They were accommodating, there when we needed them, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nShocker when the bill came-- it was way lower than I would have imagined!

The servers are lovely, the sparkly water (on tap) flowed freely all night, and our wine glasses were always filled (we brought our own-- 2 bottle limit, $15 corkage).\n\nCommonwealth is not comfort food.  Its complicated food.  Complex food.  Mostly delicious food.  And I feel like I'm especially qualified to write this review because we ordered the entire menu (there were 4 of us and its totally worth it).  The standouts for us were the lamb cheeks, the scallops crudo, and the pear salad.  We thought the chicken quenelles in a vanilla-y sauce were a miss (no sweet with my savory, thanks).\n\nEven when a dish wasn't amazingly lick your plate yummy, it was still interesting.  I may not adore the taste of sea urchin, but it was fun to experience it in all its oceany goodness.  Top-notch ingredients are featured prominently and in some cases nakedly, so you can really taste them (the chicken livers also fell in this category).  Everything is executed and presented exquisitely and the dishes are as pretty to look at as they are fun to eat.\n\n\nI think I was most impressed with the pacing of the meal-- sometimes when you order so many dishes, they come out all at once and without much thought  but not here-- we got 3 dishes at a time, which were carefully timed and presented.  It really made the difference and again, was why we spent 3.5 hours at our table.\n\nOut the door for about $60 a person (again, we had the whole menu and 2 desserts (+1 on the house :)).

Except the whole table had to order it and we wanted to try everything so we all choose 3 course and dessert to try most of the dishes.\n\nFirst dishes were fresh and light. My fav. course was Morel Mushroom. It was creamy and fresh.\n\nhen the second dishes were a bit heavy. I ordered the soft shell crab and super delicious and fresh. My favorite was the grilled squid but I don't love cilantro.\n\nMain course was young hen for me. It was moist and delicious! I tried the lamb and pork. Both were delicious as well.\n\nDessert, we tried them all! I loved the lemon cake with ice cream. The peanut butter chocolate was sweet and the frozen popcorn was a bit weird. The frozen yogurt was oddly flavored... apricot sorbet with soda way yummy. The last was a cheese dish which was not bad but I wouldn't have gotten it.\n\nOverall we took 3 hours.. We did take FOREVER to decide but it was quality time well spent with the ladies. In my opinion if you are into deep flavor and big portions, it might not be your restaurant.

Not in the sense that I don't eat anything (au contraire), but in the sense that I've eaten so much that it takes a lot to impress me. And Commonwealth did just that.\n\nAfter reading an article in 7x7 about this \"forward-thinking\" restaurant, their \"risk-taking\" chef Jason Fox, and his \"envelop-pushing\" dishes, my gastronomic curiosity was piqued. These are adjectives I like associated with my food!\n\nThe a la carte menu is split up into small snacks, soup & salads, seafood, meats, and desserts with about 3-4 choices in each category. With the most expensive dish being $16 and the small portions, I was able to order a lot of items without doing too much damage to my wallet or waistline.\n\nEvery bite was impeccable--from the way everything was seasoned to the innovative and unconventional flavour combinations and even the textures. Every dish was perfectly balanced. What an incredible meal from start to finish!\n\n*PORCINI CHURROS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=qWdUBb7di_1FOlY8hi0yTA): Nothing like the cinnamon sugar-coated churros I know and love, these are the grown-up gourmet savoury version. Crispy on the outside, moist, fluffy, and eggy on the inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=6xYpUyuUr4hVFKZ5mwp7hQ) with a nice umami flavour from the porcini powder. The huckleberry jam made this a sweet & salty treat and added a nice hint of acid too. My mom doesn't like deep-fried foods but even she was raving about these.\n*GRILLED CHICKEN LIVERS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=epDnnAzYCV9Opf1tDMpB9A): Perfectly cooked with an amazing liver-y flavour. Some marjoram added a lovely herbaceous note and pickled onions provided acidity to balance out the richness of the liver.\n*POTATO GNOCCHI (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=jouRqvMn68vrbhAx0DA2xQ): Incredible truffle and parmigiano flavours. Loved the contrast between the soft gnocchi and crunchy sweet corn. So, so good!\n*CORN CUSTARD WITH SEA URCHIN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=mCfy7rxppTjJ-avGuazQrQ): A Japanese classic with a Tex-Mex twist! This corn-flavoured chawanmushi packed some heat from the jalapenos and the uni was so fresh and absolutely delish. Crunchy sweet corn niblets provided a nice textural contrast to the silky smooth custard. I didn't like the chorizo though since it clashed with the uni.\n*MARROW STUFFED SQUID (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=m5yClXSnciLBLpm8FFIKvQ): The squid had a lovely smoky aroma and was stuffed with flavourful tamarind ground pork (for a hint of acid) and small chunks of bone marrow for added richness (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=L1xIJv9q0jCM41xh3z2s3Q). Even the shelling beans were great!\n*GRILLED LAMB CHEEKS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=V_BW7mxubg2OQBLbh--uzw): Fall-apart tender lamb! Douglas fir added a pine-y aroma and the hazelnut was an unexpected and marvellous pairing. My mouth was never bored with all the different textures from the cauliflower, pearl onion, lamb, chanterelles, and toasted hazelnut.\n*HEN & SPOT PRAWNS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=zfIJwH_7KTAiXnt4OWtnkg): The hen was tender, juicy, and moist. The head-on prawns tasted fresh but were slightly mushy. My favourite part was sucking all the juices out of the heads! The chocolate almond emulsion was just so-so but was certainly interesting.\n*PORK 3 WAYS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=WH8Wuq1z4WBiIj7M-eNryg): The pork (crispy deep-fried pork, loin, shoulder) was just ok but I loved the accompaniments. The amazing onion puree was creamy and so flavourful, the simple syrup-braised turnip added sweetness to the pork, and the mustard seeds popped in my mouth like caviar!\n*RIESLING (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=-CxxPTVPDtjioJd5ZrHpcw): An amazing sweet dessert wine balanced with the perfect amount of acidity. Slightly effervescent too!\n*FROZEN MATCHA MERINGUE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=wWX_9fRsOAQMYSVVGG-eFg): I liked the crunchy roasted pistachio and the szechuan peppers in the strawberry consomm\u00e9, but the matcha flavour could've been more intense in the airy meringue.\n*CINNAMON MILLE-FEUILLE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QxsgelKVnEdd-PQ2efI8A?select=RzN6dKXvo_6vy8WNS-Q1lQ): A grown-up s'more!

Opening seaweed-powder-sprinkled potato chips with some vinegar \"mousse\" was a clever idea, but since the mousse is cold, it's sort of unpleasant and bland, and nowhere near as delicious as good old salt-n-vinegar chips. Intriguingly-named \"compressed watermelon\" salad was just some cubes of watermelon and salady stuff; with another flavorless foam (maybe tofu flavored? who knows), and a salad of warm peppers was also swimming in some sort of creamy white foam, which is actually kind of grody.\n\nMarrow-stuffed squid were intriguing but dry, the two small splotches of sauce on the plate nearly flavorless. I think it was halibut that was soaked in rich coconut milk, and you can't really go wrong there, but it wasn't exactly thrilling. I will say the gnocchi were a gnocch-out (ha! sorry) especially since I don't usually like italian-style sloppy potato blops in thick gloppy sauce. These were compact little savory dumplings, kept mostly dry in a mixture of corn and mushrooms, a hearty fall dish with rich umami flavors. But, jeez, potatoes corn and mushrooms aren't exactly hard-to-find ingredients. \n\nThe space is standard ikea-modern with cute touches like old-school light bulbs (some of which have plants growing in them) and everybody we interacted with was nice.

It really bugged me the entire meal. Why plate a $14 entree like its a $25 entree? Just give me more food! I don't want tasteless foam or potato chips, just add an extra piece of squash or two on my ridiculously huge white plate. And the soup bowls almost made me laugh out loud. They look they are spilling at any given moment... so awkward.\n\nAlso, the finer points of the menu were somehow lost. The chilled soup was too sweet and too strong. The chocolate-almond emulsion with my young hen was just weak gravy. \n\nThe high points: the gnocchi was cheesy and hearty and the desserts met our expectations. The white russian dessert with the vodka gelee was really interesting.\n\nOverall, really not satisfying for a meal we ended up spending three digits for anyway. I'd rather go with a slightly higher price point and leave with a full stomach or happy taste buds. Nothing we ate was something we would crave or go back for.", "author": "Merrill S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-07", "description": "I would give Commonwealth 10 Stars if I could. This restaurant blows all other out of the water. I have not been able to stop raving about this place since the first time I ate here back in January 2013. That meal definitely placed in the top 5 meals of my life. Came here a second time just a few weeks ago, and I was really excited but also really afraid that it would not live up to how I remembered it. But Commonwealth solidified it's place in my heart as my favorite restaurant. It now owns the top two meals I've ever had in my life.  \n\nThe first time we ate here in Jan 2013, we ordered individual plates, foregoing the tasting menu. we sat at the counter in front of the kitchen which was extremely fascinating. I remember each dish was served perfectly - good timing, right temperature, nicely plated - and each dish surpassed the previous dish in terms of amazingness. With each dish I thought WOW this has to be the best thing I've ever eaten. And then the next dish would come out and blow me away all over again. We had anOctopus salad, beets served three ways, a lamb dish, corned beef tongue (which was a play on a corned beef sandwich complete with boiled cabbage and pumpernickel toasts), and most memorable of all was the sweet pumpkin served over red quinoa with walnut miso, crispy kale, and seriously the most perfectly poached egg I have ever had. \n\nThis time around, we decided to try the tasting menu. The menu consisted of poached oysters with Asian pear, seafood custard with dungeness crab and uni, a salad of chicories with fromage blanc, pomegranate, walnut, and persimmon leather,  American wagyu beef in black truffle jus, and for dessert, a beer meringue with chocolate ganache and creme fraiche ice cream. \nJust as before the meal started out with me thinking wow, this is amazing, then proceeded to continually blow my mind. I was very wary of the oysters because I love raw oysters, but generally hate cooked oysters. These oysters were perfectly poached so that they were still soft and creamy and the Asian pear complemented it beautifully. The custard had a great seafood flavor and wonderfully rich, creamy texture. I didn't know what to expect and this dish was a nice surprise. The American wagyu beef displaced the beef tournedos from Chez Panisse as the best beef I've ever tasted. I wanted to drink the remaining truffle jus off the plate. And the chocolate ganache and beer meringue dessert.... OMG I wish it would never end. Fantastic meal. \n\nThat being said, I know Commonwealth is not for everyone, as evident by the couple that sat next to us and barely touched their first two dishes and made a point to show their obvious distaste. This restaurant is not for stuffing yourself since the portions are small. If you're expecting a baconatoresque flavor explosion in your mouth, then go elsewhere. Their dishes are beautiful, simple, and yet so complex with clean and subtly elegant flavors. The dishes are definitely pushing the envelope and opening new doors in San Franciscan cuisine. If you're a food science fan like myself, you'll definitely enjoy their use of more avant garde cooking techniques.", "author": "Katherine T."}

Interestingly, so many of the staff from Bar Tartine moved with Chef Fox some diners might assume that Commonwealth is just Bar Tartine at a new location.  They would be wrong.  Chef Fox offers upscale food.\n\nInnovative flourishes have sneaked onto the menu.  Hints of molecular gastronomy and plays on temperature peek out.  The malt vinegar espuma with the potato chips creates a striking contrast between a soft foamy texture and the sour twang of the malt vinegar.  We also had an aperitif using nitrogen to create a smooth, ice-cream-like texture.  And the chilled summer squash soup pairs nicely with a hot, freshly fried blossom.\n\nAll of the food is solid, well executed.  One of the dishes that made the transition from Bar Tartine to Commonwealth includes the corn custard with sea urchin. So delicious!  The wine pairing was also enjoyable and fairly reasonable considering the upscale nature of the food presentation. \n\nWhile the food may be quite different from Bar Tartine, the service remains impeccable.  Professional, formal dining service but with an ease and familiarity that puts diners at in just the mood  so quickly that they may not notice how great the service is.

Everyone is lovely, the restaurant looks terrific and all my foodie friends think it's divine.  \n\nPoppy apparently possesses a plebeian palate because she thought just about every dish was pretentiously sub par. \n\nHousemade chips with a dip made out of malt vinegar and gelatin, sounded intriguing and tasted a little weird...and I generally like weird flavored chips like worchester and roast chicken...\n\n\nThe compressed watermelon salad excited me upon first viewing, there were these white semi spheres which I thought were fresh mozarella...my dinner partner was excited because he thought they were eggs...we were both wrong...it was foam made out of tofu and something else..perhaps soy milk?  There was also something very crunchy hiding under the salad which freaked me out, thinking I was eating ground glass but turned out to be a salty sugar glass with seaweed bits in it.\n\nGnocchi was ridiculously tasty, a perfect combo of truffle oil, mushrooms and cheese.  easily the best thing I ate all night.\n\nCorn custard was generally flavorless except for the plethora of red jalepeno slices.  A generous piece of sea urchin tasted like it had been marinating in a whale's large intestine for weeks and the lobster emulsion (what's with all the foam this place serves) was extremely salty.  I really and truly always eat everything.  I had a horrible dinner at Fifth Floor's bar and kept eating hoping it would get better.  This is one item that I seriously considered not finishing. \n\nHangar steak was fine, nothing special other than being remarkably small, although for 15 dollars I think it's not worth complaining too much about.\n\nDessert was relatively tasty BUT Poppy still feels the need to lodge a complaint here.  It was sold as a mille feuille.  Literally that is \"thousand leaf\" and generally in dessert terms its layers of something... This was a square of something marshmallowy, a cinnamon sprinkled square of filo, a generous square of chocolatey ganache and another square of filo.  None of these squares were even close to being stacked on each other and although very tasty (especially the ice cream on the side) it's just not cool with me when you misname something on a menu.  I felt cheated because I got something (no matter how tasty) that wasn't what I expected.\n\n I might give them another try in a year or so but I'd have to carefully peruse the menu and I certainly wouldn't want to be paying the tab.", "author": "Poppy C."}

After all, it IS *the* restaurant that became the talk of town ever since it opened in the foodie mecca that is the Mission, a restaurant co-owned by two individuals with excellent pedigree: Chef Jason Fox, formerly of Bar Tartine (which I am a huge fan of) and Anthony Myint, of Mission Street Food.\n\nOne rather disturbing thought appeared - if this restaurant is appreciated by all of the SF foodies and I find some of the creative dishes rather off, would it imply that, by the power of deduction, I am not sophisticated enough to be an SF foodie? \n\nDisturbing thought aside, here's my take of the experience.  \n\nThe service was excellent (within minutes we were presented with the delicious housemade chips with light frothy malt vinegar mousse as a dipping sauce) and I love, love, love the minimalist space.  One glance at the menu and I was impressed, $60 for a tasting menu in the land of triple-digit tasting menus? Not bad not bad.\n\nI understand the creativity that they want to infuse every dish with, I get it.  I'm all for creative dishes and I've had my fair share of what I like to call the 'WTF combo' - outrageous-sounding combo such as Momofuku Ko's shaved foie with lychee liqueur jelly, or more recently, wd~50's aerated foie with pickled beets and mashed plum.   Unfortunately it was the case of the Commonwealth's dishes sounding much better on paper and looking much better on the plate than they really taste in my mouth.\n\nI was not a big fan of the summer squash chilled soup with tempura-fried blossom, albeit being split in two by our considerate server.  The blossom tasted like nothing but fried tempura batter and the chilled soup was bland.  We were hoping that our next dish was better. \n\nIt was not.  The scallops crudo with olive oil and citrus juice was also a mistake on my part - I am not a big fan of scallops, let alone raw one.  Mea culpa. \n\nThe coconut halibut was a tad better - the halibut was flaky and the coconut sauce had a thicker curry consistency.  I'm not a big fan of the side salad that came with it. Again, the presentation was pretty - big, round plate with only a third of the space occupied, on the side, therefore leaving a big empty space in the middle.  \n\nGood thing the last two protein dishes were not bad: the pork and the lamb cheek.  Both were tender and well-cooked, but probably not enough to make me want to come back to Commonwealth (despite the private lot, which is uber-rare in San Francisco, let alone the MIssion!)\n\nAnd as for the dessert, we picked the one that everybody has been raving about: the mille feuille, cardamom marshmallow, chocolate ganache and burnt honey ice-cream.  Only two out of the four were acceptable tasting.  The burnt honey ice-cream was great and so was the wafer-thin mille feuille, but I have never tasted a cardamom marshmallow before and would not see myself craving for it in the future either.  And the chocolate ganache was just... well.... chocolatey. \n\nMaybe I really am not yet part of the rarified few that are sophisticated enough to appreciate dishes of this kind and to call themselves true SF Foodies. \n\nNext stop: In-N-Out", "author": "Ange L."}

Though the food was beautiful styled, it just wasn't tasty!  \n\nThe meal started out on a few promising notes.  The free potato chips with a malted vinegar foam delivered when you sit down were a highlight.   The pig ears were crunchy and fine.  The compressed watermelon salad and squash soup got a positive review from our friends. The fluke crudo looked pretty with a few slivers of fish and peaches but lacked flavor (not to mention was insanely overpriced for the amount of food on the plate).   The gnocchi was flavorful enough, though a little on the soft side.\n\nThe meat dishes were completely disappointing.  The hen and shrimp dish that others have remarked was the very tender came out as hard, little, flavorless medallions.  The 2 shrimp on the dish were throw-aways---nothing special that i couldn't have boiled up at home.  The goat cooked in hay, which the table got 2 of, was very tough and again lacked flavor.  The halibut went over ok--milky and soft-- but again wasn't anything to write home about.  \n\nThe desserts--the white russian and the green tea merangue--were just passable--nothing you'd ever crave. \n\nIn my book, if the food doesn't taste good, it doesn't matter that the tiny cubes of food look lovely.

I am not an enthusiast of molecular gastronomy type stuff but I appreciate good eats. This place was kind of a mixed bag, imo. \n\nA friend and I went here for dinner last night to celebrate the sale of my condo and we both opted to go a la care since the tasting menu sounded underwhelming to both of us.

I thought it needed to be cooked longer to allow the flavors to meld more when it broke. As it was, it was pretty watery and didn't have much flavor. The mint bread pudding was very distinctive and unusual. The mushroom crackers reminded me of pork rinds. \n\nThe oysters were the most interesting. I've never tasted anything quite like this dish.\n\nThe lamb's tongue didn't do much for me. Really gamey and rich.

Great space that you'd never have known was a taqueria.\n\nThe complimentary, homemade chips were yums; just the right amount of salt with a fluffy vinegar dipping sauce.\n\nSpeaking of fluffy, a good bit of our food, starting with the chips n' dip, was really airy and light. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it was strangely cohesive throughout our dishes: porcini churros, duck confit crepe, and the pork dish with mustard greens. All these dishes were really good, but their airy qualities started to bug me a little. Whether it was total coincidence or bad choices on my part, I'm not sure. Tasty bottle of pinot washed it all down.\n\nI loved the s'more-like dessert: cinnamon mille-feuille (puff pastry and cream) with cardamom marshmallow, rich chocolate ganache, and burnt-honey ice cream. Though it was also on the airy side (owing to the puff pastry, probs), the ganache gave it more substance (delicious, delicious substance), I thought.\n\nNote that if you want to do the tasting menu, everyone in your party has to do it, too.

I went there for a soft opening and I came away impressed and happy. \n\nCommonwealth had several challenges, foremost being location. Mission Street has occupants, many of whom will never step foot in Commonwealth. However, instead of building some fortified, douchtastic rooftop bar-dool, the restaurant owners acknowledged their surroundings. The parking lot isn't a chain-link, barbed wire fortress; the walls of the restaurant are frosted glass so you can see the movement of the street. Part of the ceiling has been left open for a view of the eaves. And of course, the famous donut sign that was discovered on the exterior has been left, as a nod to the restaurant's past when the building sold a dozen donuts for a dollar. \n\nIn effect, Commonwealth is embracing the history of Mission street and yet, moving it to something different. Why can't we have fine dining here? good for them.\n\nWhat's good? the gnocchi. I would like a swimming pool of this stuff. warm with truffle oil, mushrooms and fresh corn. I split a bowl but next time- one for myself. Also: the compressed watermelon with wild greens that taste like summer and nori created in a way that I can't describe. Like chips, but sorry, you'll just have to order it. words fail me here.\n\nAlso- the *squash soup* green, unapologetically green, full flavored, cold soup with fried blossoms like tempura. \n\nfluke crudo- I liked this, but I think it was the wrong fish for  the accompanying gel and tarragon. Or maybe the wrong temperature? Maybe I'm just not familiar with fluke.\n\nhanger steak- very good, but served with wheatgrass juice/sauce which completely overpowered the steak for me.  I don't think wheatgrass should be used in cooking. The flavor is just too strong and bitter and causes too many people to gag.

It was a cold, blustery rainy day in late October and the weather had been chilly all week.  The soup selection was a chilled soup perfect for an indian summer evening.   One of our party ordered it and it was the best thing of the evening.  To continue with  the unseasonable  menu was a scallop crudo with grapefruit.  We wisely didn't order it, but talked with an adjacent table at the restaurant that confirmed that the dish was just not right for a cold late fall meal.\nThe sea urchin dish was similarly a bit better for a summer day, though quite tasty if you like urchin.\n\nWe also had the matsutake salad with a slow cooked egg.  The dish was underseasoned and at the end of the dish there was just gross liquid leftover.   \n\nThe chicken liver had mixed reviews.  Some people really liked and I didn't.  It was very livery.    \n\nWe also had a carrot and radish salad and also the pear salad.  These were fine and enjoyable.\n\nFor entrees we had a specially made vegetarian ragout that was pretty good.  The mackerel was good, but not great.  The lamb cheek was good too.  The chicken quenelles had an unpleasantly soft consistency, but the puree underneath was delicious.  The pork 3-ways was good but not great.  \n\nThe deserts were not good.

It was a Basque cheese that had a nice rustic flavor to it, very powerful for such a thin slice but it didn't overtake the whole dish.

We tried to convince the waiter to alter the dessert, putting the chocolate ganache with the tonka bean frozen yogurt and strawberries. Yeah, that didn't go over very well.

The atmosphere and service were friendly and casual but did not match the food experience for me.  I wanted to linger over all the flavors and take my time.

I've never done that before, so I felt pretty cool as we told the waitress, \"we'll take one of everything.\"  The prices were very reasonable, so doing the full sweep didn't hurt the wallet too much.  That said, the portions were a bit conservative and despite having ordered the whole menu plus dessert, I was still a little hungry at the end. \n\nThe food was delicious, though.  My favorites were the truffled gnocchi, the trout crudo and the squid and pork belly.  I got to try a few things that I'd never had before, like the sea urchin and beef tongue; both of which were good.  However, I think my favorite item of the night was the beverage I got called The Gozer.  I loved the idea of it right off the bat b/c the name brought Ghostbusters to mind.  I can't recall the specific ingredients, but it was basically a champagne cocktail treated with liquid nitrogen and garnished with pomegranate seeds.  You eat it with a spoon. \n\nWe had a reservation and waited about 20 minutes for our table.  I didn't much mind b/c i was engrossed in good conversation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-14", "description": "Dinner here was simply marvellous: it is perhaps among the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco. The restaurant is only five days old, yet it already seems to be hitting its stride as its kitchen sends out confident, innovative, yet reasonably priced masterpieces.\n\nAfter meekly asking the hostess this Friday night if there might be a table available for two without a reservation, she promptly and generously seated us at the bar. Unlike many other restaurants that feature bar seating, the countertops at Commonwealth are wide and comfortable -- there was to be no awkward contortions to get at our food. The bar stools are also quite pleasant to sit in.\n\nThe menu is small, but very creative. The food is clearly based on New American classics, but showcases a heavy dose of molecular gastronomy and Japanese ingredients. After ordering a starter of the tomato salad, we were given Commonwealth's equivalent of the bread course: house made potato chips with seaweed flakes. Neither salty nor heavy, these were the perfect palate warmer without sitting too heavily in my stomach.\n\nThe tomato salad was genius. Full of heirloom tomatoes, five different kinds of basil, black olive crumble, smoked bread, some sea salt, and a deliciously light and creamy Idiazabal cheese, all of the flavours came together to produce a near orgasmic bite. The salad was also served on a piece of slate, which added a very unique visual dynamic to the food. \n\nWe both ordered the guinea hen with spot prawn as our main dish. Featuring spinach, artichoke, and a chocolate-amond emulsion, it was spot-on, delicious, and hearty. Plus, unlike many high-end restaurants here in San Francisco, the portion was actually hearty!\n\nDessert was out of this world. A cinnamon mille-feuille with a fresh, homemade cardamon marshmallow and burnt honey ice cream. The combination of the slight chewiness of the marshmallow with the savouriness of the ice cream was positively orgasmic! And, as a bonus, our bar seats had a great view of the kitchen, and we could watch the sous-chef preparing the marshmallow. \n\nI cannot recommend Commonwealth strongly enough. Run, do not walk, over to Mission Street now!", "author": "P Z."}

Very relaxed yet attentive.\n\nThe wines are incredibly reasonably priced. \n\nThey have their own parking space next to the establishment!\n\nThe desserts are wonderful\n\nThe cons:\n\nThe food while creative, was not impressive. \n\nThe marrow stuffed squid could've been SO much better had the squid been fried for a crispy shell. There was no texture. It was like biting into a soft squid stuffed with marrow. Ya, I know. To make matters worse, it was sitting on a bed of beans! BEANS! Soft, on soft, on soft. Even a bowl of soup has texture. Where's the texture!\n\nWe ordered 7 plates, and the only thing more memorable than the desserts was the watermelon salad. The cubes of vacuumed sealed melons exploded with flavor!\n\nFor 7 plates 2 coffees and a bottle of wine, plus tax and tip the bill came to be $190 for two.  I don't think watermelon and 2 desserts quite justify that price tag. \n\nI would love to come back and give Commonwealth another shot one day. But there are way too many other fantastic restaurants beckoning my call. \n\nFor that amount of money, the food should stand out more. \n\nCommonwealth, you tried to impress but failed short.\n\nI may be back once you've refined your menu.

The thyme/huckleberry jam with it was super bold and a little goes a long way.  Otherwise it would almost overpower the flavor of the churro.\n\nAsian pear salad with idiazabal cheese, ham, pomegranates, and some other stuff.  Very, very good.  Pear slices so thin, you can see through them.  An unassuming blob of cheese that hits your taste buds with such boldness.  Salty bits of ham.  Fresh crunch of pomegranate seeds.

The chef flipped out some of my faves - abalone (my dinner partner enjoyed this), sea urchin with custard, and s'mores. Also note, the restaurant was very accommodating in letting me switch out the meat options for seafood or veggie. \n\nContinuing with the \"common\" theme, the atmosphere is very communal. So be prepared to be possibly self-disclosing with dining neighbors, seating is tight.

Also - the food is truly innovative; it's not \"Figs on a plate.\"\n\nPlates are small (like Coi or the Laundry) and we had 3 main/appetizery things each.  There is a tasting menu which looked nice but we went a la carte.  \n\nhttp://www.commonwealthsf.com/menus#a-la-carte\n\nAs a starch, instead of bread was a dish of potato chips served with a malt vinegar foam.  I love the taste of malt vinegar and this was a simply epic for me; it wasn't over sharp like vinegar can be. \n\nI started the the slow cooked farm egg.  I think the egg was cooked sous vide, it was custardy and delicious; and paired really well with the mushrooms and barley on the plate.\n\nNext for me was the Squid and pork belly.  Both proteins were delicious and worked very well with the egg salad, but what elevated the whole dish was the vinaigrette and the herbs within; this added a twist of flavor that I really enjoyed.\n\nFinally the Pork with mustard greens.  I think the port was cooked sous-vide; which scares me after my Orson experience (although I think that was a temp oven), but this was done right; the meat was flavorful, and had been given a good searing on the outside.  The turnips, mustard and juniper flavors all just hung together perfectly.\n\nI have to say with the vinegar mousse, vinaigrette, and the turnips (maybe pickled a little?) the way these guys work with the acid vinegar flavor seems to be just sublime; they understand it well.\n\nDessert was also an amazing combination of flavors including a wonderful yuzu flavor.  I tasted all my wifes dishes to (including the lamb cheeks, which were out of this world).\n\nService was also really good; we arrived early, stole a parking spot and the hostess graciously allowed us to leave the car in their lot while we went for cocktails elsewhere.  I couldn't fault the service through the meal.\n\nIf you like to watch the kitchen, there are two bar seats that are right next to the kitchen.  I'm going to make a bid to sit there next time we go (because there will be a next time).  Commonwealth is fabulous.

It's such a specific texture, and repeated so frequently, that it casts a shadow on the food.  It's pleasant at first - it makes a lovely first bite, but it builds up over time on the palate.  In the quince sorbet it was totally unwelcome; instead of refreshing and palate-cleansing, it ended up feeling sticky and heavy.\n\nI also wish they'd change their menu more often - we went in September and then again in late December, and I was disappointed that the dessert on the chef's tasting menu hadn't changed.", "author": "Lulu L."}

I would have rated it 5 stars, except there were two negatives - one slight and one rather problematic. \n\nWe ordered the Porchini flour churros and beet salad appetizers to start. Fantastic. I'd get the churros again. Light and delicate but earthy, with a winey sweet berry glassy sauce that mixed well with the foresty effect savory pastry.\n\nFor second, we had the chicken livers with crisps and compote, and the gnocchi on bitter greens. The gnocchi was perfect - like eating a little cloud of soft potato and sharp parmasen. But the chicken liver was under seasoned and done as if your Mom was going to make you eat it because it was good for you. Hey, maybe this is how some like their chicken livers? The crisps and compote accompanying the chicken livers *almost* saves the dish. Almost.\n\nFor entres, we went light and had the grilled mackerel and the sea urchin with sweet potatoes. Both fantastic. I'd go for the sea urchin again in a flash. It's like uni without the japanese. \n\nFinally, we had the deconstructed cinnamon s'more with cinnamon mille feuille, chocolate ganache square, and cardamon crisped marshmallow. -1 for cliche, but +11 for tastiness. I really don't care if it wasn't perfectly unique.\n\nSo, what was the rather fatal flaw in all this? Although we were seated immediately without a reservation, we did have to sit next to the windows. If it had been a warm (or even average) night, this probably wouldn't have been a problem. But it was a COLD night, and the wall of windows seemed to radiate the chill as if we were sitting near an open freezer door. No getting around it - very uncomfortable.", "author": "sam t."}

Commonwealth uses pristine ingredients in innovative ways. It's adventurous dining for those who appreciate the experience of food as well as the flavors. I'll definitely be going back. Beyond the food, there are lots of benefits - nice counter seating area, their own parking lot, and lovely social atmosphere. \n\nWe tasted about half of the menu:\n--The tomato starter. Best I've had this season. The cheese it came with was the most delicate perfect little globe I'd ever seen. Not revolutionary though.\n--The egg custard uni dish. A highlight for me. I could have eaten two of these myself, but I'm an uni lover.\n--The coconut halibut. Amazing... infused with delicate lemongrass flavor and I loved the greens and fennel fronds on the side. The sweet grape accent didn't work for me though. \n--Stuffed squid. Also very good.\n--Goat dish. My favorite part of this dish was the fresh garbanzos!\n--White Russian Dessert. Yes please!!! I dreamt about this. Little cubes of Vodka Jello topped with coffee ice cream and meringue. Heaven. \n--A bottle of Anderson Valley Handley Geweirtz... dry not sweet and really nice with all the food\n\nThey rec 3 - 4 dishes per person because portions are small (more tastes than entrees). If I were a bigger eater I definitely would have needed at least one more thing. Full tab for all was $75/person with tip. For the quality of food and fact we had both a bottle of wine and a glass of cava each, I thought this was totally reasonable.\n\nThe only caveats I have: \n-Don't go if you want a private conversation. The tables are packed in tight and the two top next to us thought it would be fun to survey us on their topics of conversation throughout the night. \n-There were odd moments in service. Friendly in general, but we had to ask for the complimentary potato chips when we spotted them on another table instead of them being brought out. I also had my sparkling water refilled with flat when it was half full, and they had an odd tendency to place the candle in dangerous spots or wait for us to pick it up and move it before they set plates down, both of which (the candle and the plates) were hot, but we weren't warned.", "author": "Shoshana D."}

So many flavors - you just don't know where to start...\n\nStarted off with the Chef's Tasting Menu - $60 & $90 with wine pairing\n\n1. Foie gras bon bon - apple, vanilla, shaved crostini, Szechuan peppercorn paired with Grenache Blanc - Fontanel - '99 Rivesaltes\n\n- The wine paired well with the bon bon, but by itself it's too sweet with a caramel like whiff coming at you.  The chocolate seemed to overpower the foie gras.  Great presentation, but a thin layer of chocolate would do better for my taste buds.\n\n2. Radishes in various forms, goat's milk butter, mache, sunflower seeds paired with a Sauvignon Rose - Xavier - '09 Loire Valley\n\n- Served on a slate (very creative - future idea in mind =D) - Pardon my memory - but I believe this was a crisp wine - complimented the salad quite well - a good simple salad\n\n3. Asparagus custard, sea urchin, beech mushroom, chorizo, jalapeno paired with a Chenin Blanc - Charles Bove - '08 Vouvray\n\n- The Chenin Blanc became my favorite of the night along with this dish.  It was an explosion of flavors...one minute you taste asparagus, the next the jalapeno kicks in and then there was the taste of uni...I couldn't taste the chorizo so much, but this was just heavenly. \n\n4. Lamb Sweetbreads, fava beands, ramps, daikon, mustard caviar paired with Lacrima Di Morrow D'Alba - Luciano Landi - '08 Marche\n\n- Sweetbreads or ris per wikipedia are culinary names for the thymus (throat, gullet, or neck sweetbread) or the pancreas (heart, stomach, or belly sweetbread) especially of the calf (ris de veau) and lamb.  Still want to eat?? Why don't mind if I do!  This dish was just right...not too light and not too heavy.  The paired wine did justice for this plate.  \n\n5. Blood orange sorbet, fennel soda\n\n- This would have been a perfect ending to the meal.  It refreshed the palate and provided a calming effect from the previous plates.\n\n6. Peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, frozen popcorn paired with a Tawny Port - Quinta de la Rosa - Douro, Portugal\n\n- I could have done without this, but it was still a nice dessert.  Frozen popcorn looked and tasted like popcorn without the popcorn texture.  Peanut butter and chocolate ganache reminded me of a snickers bar with a rich velvety texture.  It was good, but not a dessert I would order a la carte and it made the dinner feel heavy after being lifted by the blood orange sorbet.\n\n\n**I do wish that there was some meat in the tasting menu...felt a bit lacking in that area, but overall a great meal that left me satisfied and not too overly full.  I can say that it was a bit hard to breath in my dress...it was a relief to go home and unzip =P.  This is a small establishment and the tables are really close together, which I did not like so much...The more seats you turnover, means more profit, but when I have to scoot my purse over because it's touching the next person or turn sideways or move the table to get up...it's telling you that there should be more room.\n\n**Also, they have their own parking!

Love the funky decor (i.e. industrial meets disco ball)!!  \n\nThe food is fun and the use of liquid nitrogen is always a good twist!  We had the Pre Fixe with the wine pairings which was reasonably priced.  Portions were great sized, we left full but not overly stuffed!!  Each course had something unique to make it memorable including the tartare with the creme fraiche shell (AMAZING!!).  The place is lively with a hip audience, but not snooty or obnoxious.  A little loud at times, but never to the point where you are annoyed. \n\nTo top it off they donate $10 for every pre fixe to a local charity/community program  which not only makes it good food, but a good cause!!!", "author": "Jessica P."}

Is it some epic escapist urge that is making the masses look towards more and more innovative gastronomical chef-d'oeuvres? (rhetorical question)\n\nYes. The public wants escape! They want mystery and magic and molecular gastronomy! They want froth.....And froth is certeintly on the menu at the very uncommon Commonwealth (brought to you by the creators of Mission Street Food).\n\nNow in a gorgeously retrofitted space on Mission and 18th on whose facade an original 1920's mural has been uncovered, the Mission Street Food collective has devised an elaborate menu of small plates and seasonal fare.\n\nSo what is coming out of the kitchen? Liquid nitrogen aperitifs of Floc de Gascone, ambrosia lemon, sake and lime (making a rose colored slushy that is impeccably smooth for its lack of ice crystals), compressed watermelon salad (sweeter than your average watermelon salad because all the water from the watermelon has been compressed creating sugary saturated morels - of course!) and Fluke Crudo with rose gelle, jicama and douglas fir tips...among many other intriguing dishes.\n\nAn open kitchen and a skylight give the space some expansiveness...shall we even say invoking a very New York air of refinement...(although the skylight looks in on views of the building's own wooden roof where a mirror'd disco ball has been strategially hung from the rafters!)\n\nStill, with the looming SF Food Wars, the competition between New York and San Francisco to see whose cuisine reigns supreme is getting hotter (tickets literally flew like hotcakes!)

We were lucky to snag a walk in table after about a 20 minute wait. We sat at the bar that gives you a perfect view of the kitchen and preparation. That was such a treat, and it was the calmest kitchen I've seen. We didn't do the tasting menu and ordered a soup, a delicious salad, two entrees and 2 desserts. Usually desserts are not our thing, but we watched so many being prepped that we had to try them.\n\nI had the sea urchin with the scrambled egg. Delicious but very rich, so dessert really was not necessary. Husband had the pork tenderloin, also very good.\n\nLemon cake with thyme ice cream...surprising our favorite thing of the night.\n\nAttentive wait staff, and the chef from Mission Chinese brought the chef at Commonwealth some tasty treats.

Awesome!!! Eating out with my gluten free friend and pescatarian husband never has been so easy. THANK YOU SO MUCH for accommodating the restrictions. Really, it made the meal so much better. They switched out dishes and ingredients if necessary and they weren't served anything less elegant or tasty as the two regular eaters. \n\n\nMy favorite thing -- the sweetbreads. Delicate.

Worth trying the young hen (don't worry it's sans bone) and the  halibut in coconut broth. While the peppers with goat cheese was just alright, the gnocchi was FANTASTIC! The potions are small, so plan on getting and sharing a few dishes to be full.\n\nCrowd was definitely happening, not a free seat in the place. And this was at nearly 9pm on a Tuesday.

I liked, not loved, 3 of the total tastings of which one was the replacement dish.  The Sommelier was thankfully good with the wine pairing which was the only reason I wasn't as bothered about having such a tasteless meal.  Service was mostly good.

The place wasn't open yet so we waited outside for about 2 seconds and then were ushered to our seats promptly at 5:30.   I'm not kidding but within a blink of an eye, the place was already packed to the brim with folks.  Reservations highly recommended!\n\nI had already read the Michael Bauer review before I got here so I knew exactly what to expect and wow, they did not disappoint!  They start you off with complimentary chips that they make in-house.  Good flavors and not too salty.  Though labeled as an American restaurant, the food here is not your average American food restaurant so don't go in expecting staples like steak and pasta prepared typically.  The food combinations here will definitely surprise you so keep that in mind.   The a la carte portions are small it's recommended that you order at least 2 dishes off their menu.  \n\nWe all ended up trying something different and sharing bites - my favorites were the porcini churro, the squid and pork belly, and those tasty lamb cheeks!  For dessert, the olive oil cake was a standout - so moist and savory but so simple.  \n\nIf I could sum up my eating experience here, I would describe it as  complex but still simple.  The flavors are simple to pick apart and never overpowering but somehow they manage to make you think about the way the opposing foods bring out the best of each other.  It's magic is what it is!  It should be noted that the menu is seasonal and changes every time (so it will probably be different at the time you read this) but guarantees you're always getting things fresh and in season (and therefore it'll be tasty).\n\nAs for the other little details, the service was well paced for being such a packed restaurant.  The ambiance here is elegant and unique but still casual which is very fitting of the food that is served here.  Overall, a food joint well worth it if you know what you're getting into or you like surprises.", "author": "Jean A."}

The first time was at WD50 in NYC which sucked. Commonwealth was much better but still there is something missing, that something is flavor.\n\nWe tried the tasting menu. The first thing was foie gras bon bons. Basically chocolate covered foie gras. I LUUUV foie gras but in this case the chocolate overpowered the foie gras. My co-dinners agreed, it would have been much better without the chocolate (or maybe with 1/10 the chocolate). I'm sure it's hard to make them but in the end they have to taste good.\n\nThere was a chawanmushi clone, that was probably the best dish but still not better than most normal chawanmushi dishes. The last course was a like a frozen snickers bar. The cool part was frozen popcorn which was an interesting twist but overall I'd rather have had some Humphrey Slocum ice cream.\n\nStill, it wasn't bad like WD50 was. The portions were small which IMO was perfect and everything tasted okay. I don't think I'll ever go back but I can recommend at least giving it a try for the experience.", "author": "Gregg T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-10", "description": "It's great when a new restaurant finds its focus and blossoms into something special.  That seems to be the case with Commonwealth, which I previously thought was a bit gimmicky and overwrought:\n\nThe chicken tsukune, far from asian confusion cooking, is a pretty solid izakaya-style dish.  There's tart umeboshi (pickled plum) and a sushi rice cracker with delicately seasoned meatballs grilled on what looks and smells like a little binchotan grill in the back.  It rivals most of the izakaya food I've had in the Bay Area for sheer quality and goodness.\n\nThere's a radish salad \"in various forms\" (sliced, pickled, etc) with mache, and it's just a very delicately seasoned and immaculately put together bit of greens.  I have to say the \"goat's milk butter\" wasn't very flavorful or compelling, but it hardly detracts.\n\nUni -- the foie gras of the sea minus the cruelty -- is a genius dish.  It's a perfect and light sweet potato tempura, and these bits of insanely fresh sea urchin seasoned with \"yuzu kosho,\" a special kind of Japanese pepper that blends chilis with yuzu zest.  What makes this dish great is that it's not a \"fusion\" dish at all but just a very straightforward application of subtle Japanese flavors, and executed perfectly.  Definitely one of the best uni dishes I've ever had.\n\nThe duck breast is relatively weak by comparison although it's a nice dish overall.  There's this cannoli of cauliflower mousse, some turnips, and globs of congealed blood orange, and some odd greens.  It feels a bit all over the place, and a little out of season although I'm sure it's all farm fresh.  \n\nBut most importantly, the duck breast is not quite right for me:  the fat is rather thick and rubbery and not rendered out, and if you look at the pieces, the ends are overdone compared to the middle.  Normally this would be a minor fault except the meat portion is very small, so I'd expect two perfectly executed pieces of duck.  Having said that the seasoning and flavor is spot on; it really is delicious.\n\nDessert was peanut semifreddo in ganache with frozen popcorn and caramel.  I have to say -- and this isn't really a bad thing -- the whole affair is a dead ringer for those frozen Snicker's bars I used to eat as a kid.  You know, the ones in the ice cream case in the convenience store that have like, 1200 calories per serving, but are crazy addictive.  It's quite good, and I like the nostalgia.  The frozen popcorn is a brilliant touch, it's buttery and ephemeral.\n\nOverall Commonwealth is becoming one of my favorite restaurants.  What's great about the concept is the feeling you can sort of order at random from the menu and get a bunch of pleasant but very sophisticated surprises.  And the food is definitely true to authentic cultural roots instead of just being flashy or showy, certainly more so than when I first went.  I very much hope this progression continues because there's a lot of goodness here.", "author": "J W."}

Mad points for the staff.  \n\nSave potatoes and do not serve the chips.  or make it tastier.  the sauce served w/it looks like lard and didnt have any special taste.  side of mayo would've been better.

The hostess seemed unconcerned and preoccupied with her cell phone (didn't even try to grab us a seat at the bar.)

Pours were a little light but 9 courses later I was drunk so maybe they knew what they were doing. Our somm kicked ass, she was young with dark hair and I think some tats/piercings but this may just be my imagination because we were having dinner in the mission. Either way she crushed and the pairings were good. The wines were esoteric and off the beat and path but I think this is them being cost conscious. I think that they did a great job. P.s. The foam and chips they server are great and fish should typically be served medium to medium rare and if this is not how you want it cooked you should specify this before you order. Please don't blame the restaurant because you are stupid (this is in response to a review I read before dinning here) Good time! Thanks!", "author": "Andy C."}

But, they're kind of holding themselves back - hopefully they can make a few minor adjustments.\n\nFirst, they have a parking lot - in the Mission of all places. Yay! It's got a neat side entrance that allows for more seats. Conversely, this also makes it wickedly cold when the door opens and a blast of SF fog rolls into the quaint dining room. \n\nThe host is a gem and very attentive. She checked us in and then took a drink order because our table wasn't quite ready. Nice touch.\n\nFood was a little to heavy on the foams (trying to pass them off as mousse) on almost every plate. The complimentary potato chips were poorly executed and should be skipped. The malt foam (mousse) served on the side didn't help. Mostly everything else tasted great with complex ingredients, textures and flavors. Things to not miss: gnocchi, pressed watermelon, tomato salad, some deconstructed s'more. \n\nThe portions were a little small for the prices. Perhaps the portions would be larger if they chose laser printing for their menus and business cards opposed to costly letterpress. \n\nDid I mention the parking lot?", "author": "Green Devil W."}

Not one dish had a delectable flavor that great food has; when you can't wait to take another bite. \n\nOne positive is the wine list.

Given that the place has been open just a few weeks, the service is remarkable: sweet, enthusiastic, and attentive.   The food was at best incredible and at worst very good.  \n\nGarden tomatoes and basil with black olive crumble, smoked bread,  \nidiazabel cheese was great.  Perfectly fresh and tasty tomatoes were well complemented by the cheese and novel olive crumble, which added texture. \n\nAlso great was gnocchi with corn, mushrooms, sage, parmesan, and  truffled oil.  The gnocchi were light, the corn sweet, and the truffled oil lent a nice accent.   In fact, I could easily eat vegetarian here as these plates were the highlights of my meal.  \n\nMarrow stuffed squid with tamarind pork, shelling beans, black garlic, and  cilantro was very nice although the pork added less to the plate than you might think.\n\nHanger steak with summer allums, enoki mushrooms, a crushed fingerling potato and wheat grass was nice but a bit over-salted.   Also, the crushed potato was a bit dense.  Yet the steak was tasty and as I said above the least of the dishes here are very good.  \n\nOverall the food is stylish, well presented, and has a bit of edge to it.  My server was sweet and enthusiastic (and with good reason).  And the size of each dish is somewhat between small plates and an entree allowing you to sample.

Regardless of the quality of food, a reservation should not be expected to wait as long as we did. We ended up leaving.

This is a 3.5 star review.\n\nDetails: These guys are really doing cool stuff in the kitchen. The menu screams modern, seasonal, and sophisticated. The kind of cooking you see at the other top-drawer places in town, but at half the price. Every plate is striving to mix textures, flavors, temperatures, etc. and some are more successful than others. Some dishes just seem like they threw together whatever they found at the market and they're hoping it all works.\n\nWe shared 8 plates between 2 of us. The menu changes all the time. (We would have probably preferred the tasting menu, but that night the tasting menu had a couple of things I don't care for.)\n\nArtichokes/Goat Cheese: Good. Strange. The sweet notes of the Kumquat didn't belong in this dish. We were scratching our heads on this one.\n\nPickled Herring: Really good -- evoked strong memories of pickled herring but much much better.\n\nRoot veg w/ brussels sprout: Very tasty, but a wee bit overseasoned.\n\nHalibut: Nicely cooked. Served on a \"blackened\" rapini which was way too bitter\n\nOxtail terrine: Over the top rich and tasty. Slam-dunk on that one.\n\nMushrooms w potato: wonderful. Meaty. Kinda skimpy on the mushrooms themselves.\n\nDessert 1: Peanut butter semifreddo: Perfectly delicious.\nDessert 2: GInger mousse w/ Lemon sorbet: 6 stars. Over the moon good. One of the best desserts I've ever eaten. Each component wasn't great - almost too strong, but  together they were incredible.\n\nService: Fine, but not up to the food. A little smug. Only one herbal tea on offer? And it's a weird Chrysanthemum thing with no teabag or strainer? When the waiter sees it untouched, he doesn't ask \"may I bring you something else?\"\n\nValue: Obviously massive.

We're both petite and the portions ended up being perfect.  We started with the beet salad, and the scallops.  I thought the dehydrated olives were very interesting in the beet salad.  And the scallops were delicious.  Everything worked well with each other.  Then we had the mackerel and the pork loin.  Once again, they were both very tasty.  The portion sizes were a bit larger once you move down the menu.  My only gripe was that the pork was pretty tough.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-01", "description": "Let me preface this by saying that I am a fan when it comes to the \"modernist\" cuisine movement (or whatever you want to call it), molecular gastronomy, and specifically the renaissance we're experiencing here in the SF Bay Area with a lot of chefs really pushing the boundaries and reshaping what California cuisine can be. Recent meals at Coi here in SF and Wd~50 in New York got me thinking about my meal at Commonwealth from earlier this summer (and how I've yet to get it a Yelp review). It definitely deserves the attention it's gotten thus far, but in retrospect, it's far from perfect. \n\nThe pros:\n- You really can't argue with the price point here, specifically for the 6 course tasting menu (which is what we did). Chef Jason Fox packs in a lot of technique and experimentation for $65 (with $10 going to charity), and we most definitely were full when we left. Other SF/Bay Area restaurants doing a similar thing are exponentially more expensive. I think a place like Commonwealth is playing a vital role in expanding the audience for progressive cuisine, and I applaud them for not jacking up the price yet.\n- There was a tangible energy pulsating throughout the restaurant when my wife and I were there. It was packed, lots of chatter, people seemed excited to be there and be a part of the Commonwealth experience. \n- The kombu dusted potato chips with a side of malt vinegar foam that they bring to the table to start your meal were absolutely delicious. They should have bags of these for sale!\n- Really beautiful interior design, nice high, almost loft-like ceilings. I found myself drifting off in admiration a few times throughout the meal.\n- Competent (but not mindblowing) service. \n\nThe cons:\n- Seemed like it didn't matter that we had a reservation, because we still had to wait 20 minutes after our reservation time to get seated. We already had a late reservation as it is (9 or 9:30pm, can't recall), so it made a difference. \n- Friends of the front of house very clearly showed up without a reservation and got seated before us and another couple. Granted, I've been on the opposite end of that situation before so I'm not complaining really, just merely acknowledging it happened. \n- Even though we went in the summer, it was uncomfortably stuffy and warm inside the restaurant. And it only got warmer with the wine drinking.\n\nThe food:\n- Most importantly, I think my biggest issue was with the food. I loved all of the creative techniques involved, the presentation, etc., but there wasn't really one stand out dish that made me a believer. There were a lot of cool elements in each one, but they never really came together in a cohesive way. \n- For example, the sockeye salmon tartare was incased in a frozen horseradish casing that you had to break into to get to the rest of the dish. Very creative, and it was fun busting open the casing, but the overall flavor of the dish was just... odd. The frozen horseradish killed the tongue and you weren't really able to taste the subtitles of the tartare at all. \n- An extension of the previous point, generally speaking, the dishes just have too much going on. One of the dishes we were looking forward to the most was the corn custard, but looking back on it, it also had... sea urchin... and beech mushroom... and... chorizo... and... jalapeno.  It ended up being a head scratcher. \n- Too many cold dishes. The frozen horseradish was followed by a chilled summer squash soup, which was followed by the corn custard. The fourth dish, the veal cheeks, ended up being the best one because I think it our tastebuds were just ready for some hot food at that point. Dish #5 was an apricot sorbet, and dish #6 was the peanut butter semifreddo with... frozen popcorn. Some more variation with temperatures would have made the experience more well-rounded, and who knows, maybe this isn't always the case with all of their tasting menus. \n- Speaking of cold... we were encouraged to try the nightly cocktail with liquid nitrogen. We had brought a bottle of wine with us as well, but I liked that idea so we went for it. Interesting textures, but it was pretty over the top on the sweetness and I wouldn't order it again based on that one. \n\nAt a similar price point for their tasting menu, Commis in Oakland runs circles around Commonwealth -- at least as of right now. It's an interesting and fair counterpoint -- Commis' food has heft, has soul, and still has tons of creative, progressive technique. Their service is a different level as well, the kind that makes you feel like a king. Going into my meal at Commonwealth, I really wanted to love it. Ultimately though, I feel like it's a place that's still in the process of finding it's point of view. If I could give 2 and a half stars I would -- but 2 is too low, and 3 overall is for the potential. One thing is for certain -- Commonwealth has a ton of promise. I'm looking forward to returning at some point, to see how things have evolved and hopefully, improved.", "author": "George C."}

My husband and I are both vegetarian, so we ordered every vegetarian thing they serve, but nothing else. The chickpea panisse was really nice, reminiscent of something I had at Frances a few months ago. The asian pear salad was also so fresh, with a nice dressing, (we ordered it without the ham). The baby beets were perfectly cooked, and the gnocchi were really nice, rich and truffly, but not over the top. The pumpkin was fantastic with the yuba. For dessert we got the Etude, which is cheese with some sweet and savory sides, and a glass of the grenache dessert wine. I was not really in the mood for cheese, but I must say it was deliciously smooth and a nice ending to the meal. \n\nIn summary, the food was fantastic. We also got some wine - the roche was great. The service was also impeccable - our waitress really knew the wines and gave smashing descriptions that were spot on. She also was attentive to just the right degree. \n\nThe only reason why I knock them a star is due to ambiance. The tables are SO close together in there - we were a foot and a half away from the tables on either side of us. Sometimes this isn't a huge deal - just talk quietly and mind your own business. But my problem was that the people next to us ordered the tasting menu, which included a few pungent seafood dishes. Every time they got served, I had to smell their food, and it kinda grossed me out. In my opinion, if I have to smell the person's food next to me, then the tables are too close together. However, I know the place is really small, so perhaps they have no other option here. Either way, worth a try for a nice romantic meal!", "author": "Lili L."}

The food also brings food lovers together and it adds to the specialness of the experience as we actually had great conversations with fellow diners around us. My friend and I had a hard time deciding whether to go with the tasting menu or ordering a la carte. Finally, the table next to us convinced us to get the tasting menu and that was a great decision. For the first course, we had caviar with greens. It was like a beautiful art piece and I almost didn't want to eat it. The taste was as great as the look - very delicate and subtle. The second course was fioe gras coated in honey oatmeal. The serving size was pretty generous and the taste was out of this world. The came the carrots and radish spring salad, which was another looking. The main dish was rabbit. Next was a sorbet. The grand finale was a peanut butter chocolate bar with popcorn cream. I am not a big fan of peanut butter, but I adore this dish. All 6 courses for only $65! When I was eating, the words I heard most were \"Wow\" \"Yum\" \"On My God\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-07", "description": "Commonwealth bills itself as \"A progressive American restaurant in San Francisco's Mission district.\" And progressive it is, especially if you get the $60 tasting menu since they give $10 to charity.  They also mean the food is progressive; so though the dishes are thoroughly modern, many evoke familiar feelings.\n\nHousemade potato chips come lightly showered in konbu powder accompanied by a ramekin of malt vinegar foam.  Salt and vinegar chips seem to make more sense when the vinegar isn't a powder.  Seaweed chips?  Why didn't I think of that?  I knew that deep-fried or toasted nori is delicious.\n\nCompressed watermelon chunks looked like dice of heirloom tomatoes under fresh greens and mint leaves.  Very refreshing if a little harsh, and the spots of tofu foam around the perimeter contributed little to the dish.\n\nCrispy Pig Ears.  They're pig ears and they're fried til crisp like chicharrones and served on some pickled daikon and carrot stolen from a banh mi.  Look for these on a bar menu near you soon.\n\nThe corn custard with sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion and jalape\u00f1o was a nod to the Japanese steamed egg custard dish chawan-mushi.  The silky custard had a light sweetness of corn and concealed tiny but intense crumbles of chorizo.  What better on which to place a lobe of briny sea urchin?  A lobster broth would make the dish damp, so the foam added the right amount of flavor without water-logging the custard.  Thin slices of pickled red jalape\u00f1o offset the rich and sweet flavors.  All in all, a masterful and balanced dish executed perfectly.\n\nSquid stuffed with marrow and tamarind pork was another great dish.  I am not sure what the inspiration for this dish is, but it was executed flawlessly.  Tender squid, even the tentacles, is stuffed with a soft but meaty filling of marrow and perhaps finely minced pork.  This spends a short time picking up a little sear on a robata grill and then sits atop a small bed of beans and a pair of sauces - one brown redolent of Indian tamarind chutney, and one as brightly flavored of cilantro as it is brightly green in color.\n\nThe butter-poached black cod and the lamb tongue reveal the kitchen's predilection for burnt flavors.  The proteins themselves were once again perfectly cooked but the accompaniments did lean toward a sort of over-toasted taste profile.\n\nDesserts include a deconstructed (and reconstructed) White Russian which suffered from an overabundance of crunchy whole coffee beans and something advertised as a cinnamon mille feuille.  The beans provided too much of a textural contrast with the smooth ice cream.  Perhaps they would have worked better if they were cracked.  The mille feuille was not really a mille feuille - instead it was a small rectangle of cardamom cake next to some marshmallow-like thing, dark chocolate mousse and a scoop of intensely flavored honey ice cream (delicious!).  Looks to me like a deconstructed smore fashioned of excellent ingredients.\n\nAll in all, the food was very good to excellent.  The white walled room is spare and would feel kind of sterile if not for the convivial crowd and smiling but professional staff.  The restrooms are not quite as nice as the rest of the place, and some might find it odd to have the Nine Yuan Shuai* watch you take a leak.\n\nI'm not going to rush back, but I don't think that's the point of a restaurant like this.  I am eager to see what they will do in a few months when the seasonal ingredients change.\n\n* Yuan Shuai was a rank within China's People's Liberation Army equivalent to Marshal.  There were originally 10 of them, but Lin Biao was temporarily removed from the record in starting 1971 after a failed attempt at a coup.

The servers were extremely attentive, accommodating, and pleasant. They put up with two of my friends asking for special alterations to dishes on the menu with absolutely no attitude whatsoever. Every time they brought our food out, it arrived all at once (which is awesome, because then no one feels obligated to wait or guilty for starting without others), and all dishes were announced to us. It made the whole experience very magical. Maybe it's just me, because I rarely go to nice places, but I thought it was worth it just for the service alone. In a city where everyone gives you attitude behind the counter, even a small amount of good customer service goes a long way.\n\nThen the food arrived - oh, the food.

The portion for this dish was notably smaller, especially since it's placed askew on such a large plate; the only I thing I would have preferred was to have something other than the beans as the mushy texture was too close to the squid/marrow and something a bit crunchier, like asparagus or squash, would have given it a nice contrast).\n\n- Young hen and spot prawn with spinach, artichoke and chocolate-almond emulsion - 4.5* (wow, the medallions of hen were so tender it blew me away.  The prawns, once you remove the heads, are really quite small so the dish looks to be a lot bigger than it really is).\n\nWhile the portions were on the smaller side, that was fine because for a change, that gave us room to try desserts.  We chose:\n\n- Cinnamon mille-feuille, cardamom marshmallow, burnt honey ice cream - 5* (I don't have a sweet tooth but this was one of the best desserts I've had in recent memory.  The burnt honey ice cream is literally made from caramelizing the honey and using liquid nitrogen (our server checked with the chef on this).  It was so good on its own but when you have it with the mille-feuille (complete the flaky phyllo dough and dense chocolate) and contrasted with the marshmallow), it was like a fancy smore!\n\n- White Russian dessert with vodka gelee, raw milk mousse, genoise (Italian sponge) cake and coffee ice cream) - 4* (on its own, this would have been a top dessert but it had the misfortune of being tasted right after the mille-feuille.  Love the explosions of vodka when the gelee bursts in your mouth.  So creative!\n\nHad a nice $40 bottle of their cabernet franc that worked well, especially with the heavier dishes.  This is definitely a place I would be excited to return to ... especially because the tasting menu had dishes not offered a la carte (foie gras, abalone, chilled squash soup, hangar steak).  \n\nOh, and loved the window in the ceiling through which you can see exposed wooden beans and a disco ball.  Nice touch!\n\nDefinitely one of my new favorites.", "author": "F. P."}

It was all insanely delicious with just the right portion size. For dessert, we did the cheese plate and the mille feuille. The mille feuille was the star of the night, with a beautifully deconstructed presentation and wonderful flavors. In addition to that, we had three drinks (the fancy-pants liquid nitrogen cocktail, a beer, and wine).\n\nWhile the service was a tad overattentive for my tastes, I don't think that's something worth dinging them for.\n\nThe other reviews about portion size really throw me. Our server told us upfront that they recommended 3-4 dishes per person. We did about that and were stuffed, all for a bit over $100 (pretip). Do not come to a place like this if you want to feel full. It's better to leave satisfied, not engorged. Besides, if you want to get overly full and do it for cheap, there are about nine thousand other places to eat around here. Likewise, understand this is not an everyday dinner and adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\nPlus their seaweed \"potato\" chips with the vinegar cream were off the chain. My only regret is that I eschew non-fishy meats and so cannot indulge in the tasting menu.", "author": "Jess F."}

Had the rabbit sausage (delicious, and excellently paired with a jam I forget of what), a squashy thing (very light and subtle tastes, great for summer), Halibut in coconut milk (delicious, with Elderflowers, what a rare treat), and Pork belly (my least favorite dish of the meal, not quite as ready to dissolve on your fork/tongue as I like it, but solid). I also tried some Uni (great combination of tastes), Beef (with a delicious by almost unrecognizable play on Kimchee), and carrots with an amazing green pesto-like substance. The absolute highlight however was the first amuse-geule: Salmon tartare under a dome of horseradish ice-cream. Not only was it delicious, the presentation was second to none. That actually generally held true: the presentation of the dishes is excellent. Just for the record, second amuse-geule was rhubarb-strawberry-some-other-berry-or-maybe-tomato-which-technically-is-also-a-berry gazpacho with (hazel?)nut powder. That gazpacho went particularly well with a chardonnay my wife had. Nicely balanced the wine with lots of acid. No time for dessert, unfortunately.\n\nI honestly was very surprised to find food that good here. The place doesn't look particularly impressive, and the atmosphere inside isn't high-class. It's nosier than in most restaurants that serve food of this quality. Our server made no mistakes, and they did their best (and succeeded) to accomodate our particular concerns (one lactose intolerance and some timing issues).\n\nI recommend it to anyone. I will go back, and I will probably do the tasting menu. Their a la carte dishes are all smaller, and they recommend having at least two, probably three of them (they don't distinguish between appetizers and mains, I think two are fine for the not too hungry). I felt their prices are fairly modest for what you get. It is a great date spot, unpretentious on decor and ambiance but impressive on substance. Ok. A great first or second date spot, not really for the cuddle in the booth and look you deep in the eye over a candle kind of date -- it is too noisy for that.", "author": "Martin W."}

They're known  for their tasting menu, so that's what we wanted to do. However in our party of 4 we had two omnis and two vegans, which will usually kaibosh any attempt at a tasting menu anywhere other than Millennium. Not so at Commonwealth. They do an omni, vegetarian, and pescatarian tasting menu every night, and will happily accommodate vegans, as well as any other dietary restrictions you might have, without fuss. For just this, I love them. \nIncredible food.  Really, incredible food. It was beautiful, and it was tasty. Also, unlike some other reviewers, I left incredibly full (I managed to finish dessert, but only just). \nWonderful service. The service was very professional, but still laid back enough that you don't feel uncomfortable wearing your jeans or laughing raucously at something that your dining companion may have said. The sommelier knew her business, though I wasn't sold on all of the pairings. \nReasonably priced. The tasting menu was $75. $115 with matching wines. For the quality of the food, and the service, that really is well priced for SF. \nAmbience. I really liked the internal lighting, and the dining space. In general everyone seemed to be having a great time, including the staff, and the restaurant had a good vibe to it. \n\nThe not perfect: \nDrafty. We were seated along the same wall as the entry door. Every time someone opened it (which was often, as the place was packed) I froze... admittedly it was a really cold night in SF, but it was annoying and impacted my experience. \nLighting. Also a function of where we were seated. There is a street light right outside the front window that turns itself on and off every 15 minutes or so. It's really annoying. Not the restaurant's fault of course, but it was distracting. \nParking. They have parking, but the lot is tiny, so you're probably going to have to drive around in circles for 20mins before you find a park. Whatever, this is SF. This is no biggie and is probably more annoying only because they have that parking lot, so you'll find yourself cursing everyone who managed to get a spot in it before you. \n\nSo, my tip - ask for a table on the back side of the restaurant under the row of lights and away from the door.  Get the tasting menu. You'll have great food and leave without prompting a call from your bank manager.", "author": "Samantha W."}

Let's face it, there are some crap snooty restaurants in the city and the last thing I want to experience when shelving out money to dine out is poor service. Amazing food should not makeup for where service is lacking. Commonwealth has by far, the best service I have ever encountered while dining out here in San Francisco. Everything can be commended from the attentiveness to detail by all of the waitstaff (from folding our napkins everytime one of us went to the restroom to replacing silverware with each course) to the teamwork in the timing and delivery of the courses. Not only was our server so knowlegeable about the ingredients used in our dishes, but was also not a prick about educating a naturally curious soul such as me. I could tell that when he talked about the food, there was heartfelt passion behind what he was saying; all I could do was to listen, absorb and appreciate.

Upon arrival, the wait staff were not warm. our server never smiled or had warth to her and rushed us throughout the meal. Plates were wisked away quickly and new plates and utensils were loudly banged on our table. It made for an unpleasant experience, especially since we had not seen our friends in a while and the woman was recovering from cancer. At one point, one of our dishes was taken away before we were finished.! When I made a mention, the waitress did not even apologize and came back and almost threw a plate down with 1 or 2 extra food items. The waitress really soured our experience because there was no smile, no warmth, and a rude demeanor.  The food was not as good as I had hoped and the portions are very small. You need at least 3 items to feel mildly full. It was certainly creative with the mix of typical items, variety on menu and presentation, but it lacked flavor and texture in some areas. I ordered the nectarine salad, the hen with burnt eggplant and tomatoes and the Molasses cake with plums and ginger. The nectarine salad was good. The hen was prepared well, but a bit salty. the burnt eggplant sauce was a grey burnt streak that tasted more like burnt bread than eggplant. Plus, it would have been better if it was more purple. The jello tomato was tasteless. The molasses cake was dry and the freeze-dried ice-cream, sauce and plums did not moisten it. I can better at home. Commonwealth does have a creative menu and nice presentation, but all of the sauces and ultr-cuisinarted items take away from the true flavor and texture. It is an interesting experience, but they need to work on the wait staff and some of the sauces. Thanks.", "author": "Vanessa B."}

Besides the dessert, which was easily the best dish of the night, nothing really wow'd us. The taste of each dish was extremely subtle or possibly in another word, bland. The combinations are all certainly interesting and the presentation and atmosphere of the restaurant are great, but I just did not feel that the food was worth the price. The tasting menu when we went was not appetizing to us in the least but we were told it was what they were known for so we wanted to do one of each. Well nope, they won't let you do that, it's everyone at the table does the tasting menu or no one does. That wasn't deal breaker for my husband and I, but the table of four next to us seemed to have a harder time as a few wanted to do the tasting menu and a few did not. It could potentially make it awkward if you are with a larger group to decide. I really don't think any of the dishes, other than the dessert were truly memorable. When the bill came, it was actually more than we paid at another popular foodie restaurant and we were both still hungry. We ordered three dishes each and two desserts and we joked about ordering a third dessert. Maybe the rotating menu this time around wasn't spectacular, I am not sure, but I would not come back here again.", "author": "Kat H."}

What could have been a disastrous evening was immediately and skillfully rectified by an attentive service staff.

To compensate, we all received a free round of drinks while we waited and the full round of appetizers once we arrived at our table (all of which were delicious).  After that, the evening was pleasantly uneventful.  The restaurant is small but inviting.  The ambiance is lively but not overbearing.  The food is creative but satisfyingly so.

Unfortunately, the concept is unsustainable because of the expensive ingredients and labor-intensive culinary presentation - but worth a trip before they close or revamp their menu.\n\nAgain with the Shishito peppers that seem to be everywhere.   One in nine are super hot.   Chicken livers were just that, nothing to note.   The gnocchi, however, was worthy of being served at Quince.   The stuffed squid was very unusual and reminded me of the homemade sausages from Buy Rite.   The sea urchin was served in a bowl of lobster foam.   The delicate halibut was poached in a coconut milk sauce and the pork presented three ways (a la Michael Mina).   Every dish was superbly presented but with more plate than food.

We had the tasting menu (they even have a pescatarian one!) and it was superb. Every course had interesting textures, flavors, and scents. I was so pleased because I read so many of these yelp reviews with people complaining about the portions being too small or the food being bland or the service being poor. REALLY people??? Not to be a total elitist, but you go here to try something innovative and different, and yes you will need to order 3 dishes each so it will be more pricey and unusual than California Pizza Kitchen or Chili's, but that does NOT merit a bad yelp review!! I actually almost cancelled my reservation after reading all of these terrible reviews because I was so worried about spending too much $ for nothing. I'm so glad I kept the res and went!

We had the tasting menu and wine pairing for a total of $95pp. The food was very good and the portion sizes were quite large - larger than necessary, actually. I didn't love the wines on their own, but thought they paired wonderfully with the food.  My only complaint was that in the first two courses there was one flavor that overpowered the dish: radishes in the abalone salad and leeks in the crab/uni soup.  I had to do some picking to be able to find all the flavors in those two, but away from the strong elements they were great.  And the sunchokes and venison courses were perfect.  I was basically too full to eat the PB semifreddo, but it was tasty - not too sweet.  Though the faux popcorn was strangely yucky.\nWe sat at the bar and were served by Sarah, who was awesome - so friendly and helpful.  We REALLY enjoyed spending a couple hours with her.  \nBottom line I think the value of the tasting menu is exceptional.  Saison in particular should be worried.  And probably Sons&Daughters too.\nI'm not sure Commonwealth lives up to all the hype it has received on a national level (or their PR is fantastic!), but it's a great go-to spot for a large, excellent, well-priced, prix-fix meal without any stuffiness.", "author": "Ellen H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-18", "description": "Had a 5:30PM dinner reservation on a Sunday night with my family of 4, two adults and two kids, late August. There is a parking lot right next to the restaurant that probably fit about 10 cars. The sign says to pay $5 for parking to the hostess at Commonwealth but they never asked us for payment.  \n\nThe place is not very big with nice minimilist/modern decor. There are about 10 or so tables and a counter for bar seating. The experience dropped dramatically when I walked in and saw a bunch of flies buzzing around. Much more than what I expect from a restaurant, let alone a fine dining one such as this. Since we're there for the first seating of the night, I expected the staff to take of things like this but it didn't look it. At one point during dinner, there were like 6+ flies near the window. This couple sitting right by the window had to ask to be moved to the bar complaining that the flies were dropping into their food. Not what you want to hear from people dining at your restaurant. \n\nThe food had good flavor. Presentation was nice with large plate but small portion. I suppose that's the trend for this type of dining experience. Some of the folks dining that night order the tasting menu. We just ordered a la carte....since it was our first time and we had kids. When we placed our order for the main course, the waitress had to remind us that since their portions were small, most patrons order 2 - 3 dishes per person. Wow! even at that price? So we ended up ordering two appetizers to share. One was a chilled soup and a plate of grilled sardines. They were good...enough for a bite or two per person. \n\nFor the main course, we each ordered something different. My children had the crispy young hen and the scallops. My husband had the pork chop and I had the charred octopus. When the scallops arrived, the plate had a total of two scallops. When he saw this, my son promptly said, \"is this it?\"...which I thought was amusing that he's so honest. He promptly ate everything on his plate, except the yuzu kosho emulsion. He wasn't too found of the foam. \n\nIt was a good experience; although I probably won't visit the next time I'm in town. A bit over priced for my taste. If anyone ever is in Southern California, I would recommend the Sunday supper at Lucques. Same price as the 3-course a la carte at Commonwealth, bigger portion but same great taste.", "author": "Heather M."}

We sat at the bar and had good service from the bartender.  Not very long into our visit, a woman with glasses and curly hair (the manager, perhaps?) gave us our check without us asking for it. But given that this is a large metropolitan area, I didn't think that a restaurant with a bar would be asking us to leave at 11:40 pm, especially since there were other patrons who came in after us who didn't seem to be getting the cold shoulder.  They weren't given their checks or any cross looks.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the woman surfaced again; this time, to make it known to us that she \"was all set\".  She took my friend's empty wine glass away and looked at us as though we had been the only ones in the restaurant for some time and were holding her up from home.  My friend told her not to worry, that we would be leaving soon.  I still had a couple of sips of my overly priced wine left and continued to talk to my friend after having our conversation interrupted for the third time.  \n\nAt this point, the manager replied, \"I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"  Shocked, as we had neither started a bar fight or even reacted appropriately to the rude woman who ordered us out, we left.  Now, I've worked in the food service industry and I understand that when you have a bad day it's hard to be friendly.  But we were perfectly nice to the waitstaff and quietly enjoyed the wine we paid for when asked to.  If you're having a bad day, that's YOUR issue, not the customer's fault.  \n\nDon't patronize this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-11-13", "description": "Complete disappointment. Wow. I have been so excited about coming here for so long- since I received an email from Myint back in the spring asking for people to invest in his idea of a restaurant based off of Mission Street Foods- delicious, creative food at a decent price, with part of the proceeds going towards food banks. It is the antithesis of that concept, minus the \"creative\" part, I guess. I am sad that I gave them $50 as an investment in their restaurant to sit on for 6 months- esp. as Im a grad student and not a wealthy hipster. \n\nI went here with my boyfriend and parents on Thursday night, after being scared away by the huge line at Gracias Madre (we were looking for something more relaxed and casual initially). There was no wait at all at Commonwealth and I had wanted to go here for so long- I even skipped going here on my birthday because the owners had asked the investors to wait a month after their opening before using the money- all the reviews of the heirloom tomato salad, gnocchi, and mielle-fieulle had had me drooling for months. It is so hard to find good food as a vegetarian, and those options were so enticing!\n\nWe sat down in our cramped corner booth (it was hard to get out between us and the other table with less than a foot gap between the two, and the waitress could barely hand us our plates/refill water) and looked at the menu- but it had changed! At first I was sad because I had missed out on the salad and gnocchi, but then I thought, \"of course they would change their menu, I'm excited to see what new things they have thought of\". But no. Ok, so I don't eat seafood or meat. But the vegetarian \"options\" were a joke. And \"we now sort our menu by protein content\"- WTF? This allows us to know nothing about portion size. The sparkling water was nice, I will give them that. We didn't order any other beverages. The waitress did not understand what \"vegetarian\" meant- she seemed to think we ate fish but not dairy/eggs. I tried to explain that we were not vegan, but this concept was even more foreign to her, so we ended up frustrated- I mean, we just don't eat anything that bleeds, really. Why is that hard to understand? \n\nSo, food:\n\n*Chips/vinegar whip: WTF NO. Foam is BAD. Bread, please. My mom might have been happier (\"the sparkling water was filling?\")\n\n*Porcini mushroom churros with huckleberry sauce: first, I'm not a huge fan of fried things, and this was FRIED. Fine. I got over that, but then the mushrooms were nowhere to be found- there was this ephemeral pasty stuff inside that I can only assume had been mushroom before it had been sonicated to death. It was extremely unique in its physical properties though- melted in your mouth as there was nothing but fried friedness.\n\n*Slow cooked farm egg: I was excited because egg+barley = healthy and protein. Yay. But no- there was SO much you could do with this dish and they killed it. It was interesting looking, but the egg was cooked so long that it fell apart, it was closer to foam than to, well, egg. The barley was fine but it is hard to screw up barley, but the mushrooms were so tough they were almost inedible despite being relatively finely sliced and cooked. The decorative edible flowers were ridiculous. The worst part was that it tasted like nothing but barley- and barley doesn't taste bad- but salt? pepper? sage? spice? something? No. Bland weird shit that mostly was just barley. Not worth my time or money. I can do that at home. For $.50. And add salt.\n\n*Kabocha pumpkin: my boyfriend had this and I tasted it, was easily the only good thing on the table. Like a light Thai curry, tasty of course, but again not worth the money- go to a good thai restaurant instead.\n\n*Shaved carrots and radishes: my mother had this and I tasted it as well, it was probably the better salad/appetizer thing on the menu, the goat cheese was tasty (the \"ash\" part eludes me), was an interesting salad but again not worth $8, much less $12.\n\n*Scallops: my mom ordered this and I think almost up and left the table it was so weird and unappetizing.\n\n*Asian pear salad: dad had this and it was \"ok\" but I think the pomegranate seeds threw the taste off quite a bit for him\n\n*Chicken quenelles: dad had this and I heard nothing, which is not a good sign.\n\n*Cinnamon mille-fieulle: the only possibly worthy dish of the night. Only in its unique-ness and the fact that it is really freaking hard to screw up chocolate-based anything. The clove taste (from where I do not know) was wonderful. My mom refused to try it on the basis that the rest of the food had been so horrendous, she did not want to experience how badly the chefs could mess up a chocolate dessert.\n\nMy parents and I aren't that old or bland- early 50's and early 20's, respectively, and we all love food and spices and creativity. So we aren't just meat&potatoes people. But we have standards. If someone else is paying, and you don't like food, fine, go here. Otherwise, RUN to Gracias Madre. Or even Taq.

I don't say this lightly and I understand that many who go to Commonwealth would think me to have an unrefined pallet.

Philanthropic business model. \n\nOn a quiet Thursday night, the fabulous Connie C. and I were catching up and enjoyed a progressive dinner at the philanthropic Commonwealth. The d\u00e9cor is clean and minimialistic - white washed walls, light oak wooden tables and Edison bulbs hung overhead. \n\nWe started off with the complimentary Housemade Chips with Nori and Malt Vinegar Mousse. A play on fish and chips, they were one addicting little salty snack. We finished the entire bowl despite all the dishes we also had at the table.\n\nWe shared a number of the exciting, innovative offerings on the menu and dessert menu:\nGarden Tomatoes and Basil, Black Olive Crumble, Smoked Bread and Idiazabal Cheese. \nPotato Gnocchi, Corn, Maitake Mushrooms, Sage, Parmesan Reggiano and Truffle Oil\nCorn Custard, Sea Urchin, Chorizo, Lobster Emulsion and Jalapeno\nButter Poached Black Cod, Cauliflower, Dashi and Sea Beans\nYoung Hen and Spot Prawn, Spinach, Artichoke and Chocolate-Almond Emulsion\nWhite Russian: Coffee Ice Cream, Vodka Gel\u00e9e, Raw Milk Mousse, and G\u00e9noise Cake \nCinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, and Burnt Honey Ice Cream\n\nThe tomatoes were light and sweet and I especially like the Idiazabal cheese, a soft sheep milk cheese with mild flavors. The potato gnocchi was my favorite of the night. Light and pillowy, they melted like butter in my mouth. The fresh corn added a nice textural contrast to the dish. The steamed corn custard was silky, so silky I thought it could have been tofu or steamed egg. I couldn't quite make the connection between the raw sea urchin and the steamed egg custard. It seemed a bit random to me. \n\nWe then moved onto the butter poached cod topped with a piece of crispy skin. It was cooked perfectly though I wish there was still a little more contrast in texture. The hen was tender and moist while the prawn is cooked again to perfection, not a second more. They sprinkled grains of salt over the dish, which made the dish a little oversalted, and we both actually bit into grains of salt.\n\nWe both loved, loved, loved the Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, and Burnt Honey Ice Cream. It was a deconstructed and reinterpreted s'more. The bitter chocolate ganache was thick and creamy. The marshmallow had the fluffiest texture and hints of cardamom (ginger) flavors. Connie convinced the table next to us and the table next to them to both order this dessert.\n\nThe White Russian was a coffee ice cream with vodka gel\u00e9e and raw milk mousse atop a g\u00e9noise cake. The coffee ice cream is very good and they were smal bits of toffee and coffee beans sprinkled over the dessert.\n\nAll that helps Commonwealth to donate parts of its proceeds to a monthly unique charity.

There are only a few occasions when Calvin would have to find a restaurant and book a table all on his own. One of which is my birthday and this year for the restaurant he chose Commonwealth. \n\nOn the day of my birthday he told me that the restaurant we were going to is at 18th and Mission and he hoped that I haven't eaten there yet. I asked him to keep it a surprise, but I was racking my brain after he told me the cross streets.. We headed to the location and found parking down the street. (Please note that Commonwealth has their own very small parking lot that is connected to their building, so check there first before looking for street parking.) We walked up and when I saw the name I exclaimed \"BABE! GOOD JOB!!\" as I had very well heard of this restaurant and actually bookmarked it! \n\nWe walked in and were seated immediately. The interior is simple, but beautiful. Big old fashioned light bulbs hung from the ceiling with soft low lighting. Small, unique artwork on the wall. Nice wooden tables and wooden accents throughout the restaurant. But my favorite part of the entire restaurant, the BIG OPEN KITCHEN! If you are seated along the back wall, you can get a good view of the kitchen and the action. Or if you don't mind sitting at the bar, you can get a front row seat to the action! \n\nNow to the food... \n\nWe were looking over the menu and I must have made a comment about sharing our main course and the server mentioned that the menu isn't grouped by size or course, but rather by category (veggies, seafood, meat). That was good to know, because otherwise we wouldn't have ordered enough. She suggested that we order 5-6 plates if we were going to share everything. So we went with: \n\n~ Summer squash chilled soup with fried squash blossoms, shaved salad - I usually don't like chilled soup, but this soup was flavorful, yet gentle. The stuffed and fried squash blossoms were a great accompaniment. \n~Potato gnocchi, corn, maitake mushrooms, sage, parmesan reggiano, truffle oil - This was superb! The flavors and textures were absolutely perfect. Calvin and I were clinking forks a lot with this dish. \n~Corn custard, sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion, jalapeno - AMAZING. Absolutely amazing. I could eat this in a larger portion with a side of rice. Yeah, I know. How asian of me. But seriously, this dish was amazing... The chorizo gave this dish a nice salty and smoky twist to something so softly sweet. \n~Marrow stuffed squid, tamarind pork, shelling beans, black garlic, cilantro - Yes you read that right. MARROW STUFFED SQUID. When I started to cut the squid, there was a little hole in it and the juices from the marrow came squirting out. So awesome! \n~Hanger steak, summer alliums, enoki mushrooms, crushed fingerling, wheat grass - This dish was the least favorite, but still good. I felt that the steak was way too chewy, but the mushrooms and fingerlings were really good. \n\nFor dessert we had the cinnamon mille-feuille. It was definitely good, but I wouldn't order it again... \n\nThe entire experience was fantastic and the prices are so reasonable. I would easily pay a lot more for the dinner that we had. The quality is amazing and the creativity of the menu was executed beautifully. This is definitely one of the BEST NEW RESTAURANTS in all of SF. We can't wait to go back. Going to wait a little bit for the menu to change with the season, but we will definitely be back!!!\n\nBy the way, if you are reading this, awesome folks of Commonwealth, Calvin and I loved your flatware! We loved it so much that we have been searching everywhere trying to buy it. Well, we finally found it, but we need a restaurant license to purchase it. Sooooo... If you want to sell us 40 pieces (8 settings), we'd be forever thankful! Just sayin'...", "author": "Jen D."}

I was pleased with my dining experience but there are a couple things that fell short for me.  \n\nAtmosphere: They have a super cool interior, with soft lighting, metal and wood elements, and some kind of plants that hang in glass balls.  It's a good look.\n\nFood: They're all up on the molecular gastronomy (foams, liquid nitrogen, etc) which is fine and well executed here.  My food was good but it was too rich.  I don't mind rich food, but what I do mind is decadence for the sake of decadence.  There was simply too much cream, too much fat, too much salt.  Was it good?  Yeah, it was ok.  Did it make me feel disgusting afterwards?  Yes, yes it did.  Just for the sake of example the tasting menu started with some delicious potato chips (obviously oily), then moved onto salmon tartare with frozen horseradish.  Sounds refreshing right?  It would be except that the horseradish is mixed into some kind of cream/mayo mixture and then frozen.  It does not have a clean mouthfeel at all.  The squash soup that I had tasted like it was made with half-and-half.  Again, was it good?  Yes.  Was it overwhelmingly rich?  Yes.  The same can be said for the veal cheeks.  The bottom line is that while the food is good it's not that impressive.  Anything tastes good when it is absolutely loaded with fat and salt.  Given the kitchen's mastery of molecular gastronomy I truly believe that they could deliver better dishes.\n  \nService: The service was great.  I had several questions about the wine (there were some varietals on their tasting menu that I was not familiar with) and I got an education from our server.  Excellent job.\n\nBottom line: This place is definitely worth checking out, but it may not be worth coming back to.", "author": "Steve B."}

There were plenty of other exciting choices available.  \nVeg terrine and Jerusalem artichokes to start - the terrine was a clever way to present the root veggies.  Very artistic.  The heady horseradish sauce served with it made the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the beets and parsnips.  Tempura fried trumpet mushrooms were a delicious part of the dish.  We equally enjoyed the artichokes with the many components of taste and texture.\nSea urchin custard and lambs tongue came next for us.  While delicious, the chawanmushi style custard is better executed at Nojo.  Lambs tongue was out of this world.  We could and should have stopped here and ordered dessert but nooo,  we just had to try the Sole.  Glad we did.  Crunchy fried tender chunks that were melt in the mouth.\nSplit the chicory mousse with bruleed bananas.  Loved the airy lightness of the mousse - very delicately flavored.  \nThat was it.

Once you crack open the dome then you'll see the salmon under, it was a good mix or else just eating the salmon and roe eggs would of been a bit too salty.  Salad was a bit blend.  Egg custard with uni had a lot of water under as you were eating it, this is suppose to be like chawan mushi and so much liquid is not suppose to be underneath if cooked right.  soft shell crab was fried just perfect and the sauce to compliment was good.  veal cheeks were marvelous as it just melts in your mouth, I think it was prepared in a water bath and tasted great.  \n\nOverall I would give the food a 3 star because I can see the chef is really trying, it had great presentation but taste just didn't give me that wow factor I was looking for.

But commonwealth is actually kind of good.  It hurts to admit it... but it's true.  Walking in on a Wed evening with no reservations, but in the company of the lovely M, we were seated at the bar almost immediately.  The place has that slick Euromodernist look that these kinds of places do adore.  Really, it has the feeling of a slightly less trashy version of the place shown in Soul Kitchen.  I think that's what they were going for.  I constantly kept expecting a knife wielding chef to come after me for my mistreatment of his soup.  \n\nWith this in mind, I did not order soup.  Instead, for the main course, we got the Flank Steak  and the Compressed Watermelon with tofu.  Now, I know Tofu, and what came with the watermelon was no tofu.  It looked and acted like globs of slightly congealed soy milk and I did not have it.  The rest of the dish, fortunately, was quite delicious.  The watermelon and other sort of melon was very juicy and salty and flavorful and the grass it was surrounded by provided a nice contrast.  The Flank Steak came next.  Now, cows are pretty large animals, right?  They've got massive flank.  The dish, on the other hand, had the opposite of massive flank, which is to say... four tiny pieces of medium rare steak surrounded by incredibly tasty onions and a perfectly cooked potato with the tastiest crispy skin ever... if only there was more meat.  For desert, we split the Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, which was a Deconstructed marshmallow worthy of Derrida himself.  Yum.  \n\nSo, considering the small portions, elaborately structured dishes, and decor, you'd expect this place would cost us at least 30 a person.  WRONG.

I was so excited to try this place, based on all the rave reviews, and based on my love of Tartine.  We had:  nori chips with a foam malt vinegar (everyone gets this), shishito peppers with goat cheese and rose petals,  chilled squash soup, corn custard with uni, squid with marrow and tamarind, and young hen with spot prawns, and for dessert we tried the white russian coffee ice cream with vodka gelatin.\nI liked the chips with the foamy vinegar, which was creamy and tart, but melted into its liquid form after a few minutes.  But that was fine.\nThe shishito peppers were spicy - which i liked.  woman next to us felt they were too hot and asked for a glass of milk.  I talked to the waitress about the difference between shishito and padron peppers - how every now and then you get a hot padron but mostly they're mild - and she said that in just the space of a week the peppers had all turned fiery hot - but there was no disclaimer on the menu. Our waitress did forewarn us, but we like spicy food, and they went well with the creamy goat cheese, and the rose petals (which were scarce, so i only actually got a taste of rose, my BF didn't).  \nThe soup was creamy and light, and refreshing on this hot night, but apart from a few slices of squash, tasted only of salty mint - if you got a bite with squash, or arugula, then it was good, both for the texture and a slight taste difference.  the squash blossoms were fine tho a tad greasy - maybe they had sat a few minutes too long after frying.  the blossoms came atop a salsa verde - best part of the dish. i couldn't taste the vadouvan at all.\nI was most excited to try the corn custard with uni, lobster emulsion, chorizo, and jalapeno.  The custard portion was ok, with nice little bites of corn, and the whole pieces of uni - were rich and gamy, like what I expect from uni, but the lobster emulsion was all but undetectable - I got of whiff of lobster on my first bite, but that was it. There was no evidence at all of chorizo.  The whole thing was a creamy kind of comfort food dish, kind of like a congee, but once the custard melted it was kind of soupy.  There were little bites of something chewy, which we assumed were lobster, but they were kind of flavorless - just texture.  There were slices of red onion or shallot, which also gave some texture, but overall, the flavors were muddled and the dish was mostly very mild, flavorless, which was astounding to me with the list of ingredients.  Not objectionable, but not at all what we expected.  \nWe then waited a good 20 minutes for our young hen and squid dishes.  The squid was delicious - the only stand-out of the night, and it was really, really good.  A nice smokiness, perfectly tender, and the marrow inside was flavorful (tho oddly chunky rather than smooth, but not a bad thing), and perfectly offset by the tamarind smear on the plate.  A really well conceived and executed dish - what I expected from the whole meal - and was so startled by because it was the first time during the meal that I was wowed.   The only clunker in the dish were the shelling beans, which had no place in the dish and added nothing .\nThe hen was completely flavorless.  Nicely cooked tender slices of flavorless fowl, over a flavorless \"chocolate-almond emulsion\" - not a hint of these - or any other - flavors in the sauce.  The spot prawns were good and smokey, and were very tasty, but there was such a contrast between them and the hen that they didn't seem to belong on the same plate.  The spinach gave a bit of flavor, but the few bites of artichoke added nothing and didn't seem to belong in the dish. Hen and artichoke - usually a great pairing!  I wouldn't have ordered this dish myself -the BF did, as he doesn't like fish very much, and the menu is seafood slanted, but even so - it was a huge disappointment.\nDessert:  the coffee ice cream was good and flavorful, with a nice white chocolate cream, and some type of cake underneath it, can't remember what now, but the vodka jelly thing was a distraction. There were whole very crunchy coffee beans strewed about, which added good texture and a deep flavor, but they were so hard as to cause fear of cracking a tooth. I usually don't even get dessert, but we were still hungry!\nI had a nice Rose colored Pinot Grigio from Santa Barbara, which I really enjoyed.\nI had such high hopes, and now I don't ever feel the need to go back.  And again, I'm truly baffled by the rave reviews here.   Comparisons to Commis, which I loved, are without merit, because although the prices at Commonwealth are more reasonable, the flavors are just not there.", "author": "maria a."}

As the host shared with me and my eating companion, it is the heart of the restaurant.  $10 from each tasting menu is donated to a non-profit, community based organization.  The night we were there, the beneficiary was the People's Grocery in Oakland.   \n\nThe tasting menu and wine pairing was an amazing experience...and that's exactly what it was...an experience.  Don't hesitate to start off the evening with the Gozer, an unexpectedly, delightful frozen before dinner treat.  Here is what we had...I might not remember everything considering that I was quite tipsy from the wine pairing by the time dessert arrived:\n\n* Citrus sorbet with Strauss yogurt with hints of sage, truffle, and nuts - Light and savory at the same time, beautiful presentation \n* Trout crudo as an amuse buche - Artfully designed with different textures coming together in my mouth\n* Foie gras bon bons, vanilla-infused apples - WOW...At first it was confounding and strange and then it was delicious and I couldn't wait for the next bite...The different components all coming together perfectly...A unique welcome to a dinner experience yet to come.  After this, my curiosity was piqued and I couldn't wait to see what else was coming. \n* Mixed chicory greens with winter root vegetables prepared different ways, light and refreshing \n* Risotto with uni and dungeness crab - Creamy and filling, foam  reminiscent of the sea\n* Grilled octopus with sea beans and fingerling potatoes - I've always been curious about sea beans and this was a great way to eat it, with the most tender and perfectly seasoned octopus\n* Sweetbread with celery root veloute (I think it was celery root) - My first time eating sweetbread which is veal gland.  Buttery and smooth, each bite melted in my mouth.  I'll eat it again. \n* Blood orange sorbet with fennel soda - Ahhh...a nice palate cleanser to prepare for dessert.\n* Chocolate covered, peanut butter semifreddo, brittles, and  frozen popcorn - Delicious, I'm sure, but here is where I am totally disappointed in myself...and embarrassed too.  I was so tipsy from the million glasses of wine I felt compelled to drink and savor, that by the time dessert rolled around, I wasn't able to finish it.  However, the bites that I did have brought the whole dinner experience full circle (see foie gras bons bons).  It was brilliant.  I've never had a dinner experience quite like it.  \n\nWith that, I encourage everyone to try the Chef's Tasting Menu that I think truly highlights the Chef's talents.  It was absolutely amazing.\n\nTIP:  If you're a light drinker, split the wine pairing with your dinner companion.  You don't want to be tipsy for dessert.  As for me, I will have to go back, sit at the bar, and order dessert.", "author": "Amihan C."}

Ever.  Worldwide.  We were out spontaneously with good friends and we were trying to find a yummy place where the four of us could sit for a couple of hours and catch up, enjoy some good wine and yummy food.  The place we had in mind did not work out and we passed by Commonwealth and we thought - that looks like a nice place and of course looking it up on Yelp...the reviews encouraged us to give it a try.  1 tasting in and we were so glad we did!  They had no tables available, but there was some fabulous bar seating with a full view of the kitchen.  I think for my chef of a husband, this was the prime seat in the house!  The innovative and delectable stuff they create here - I can't even explain it, but everything will melt in your mouth and you will love it.  I am not adventurous enough to eat urchin and our lovely server didn't even give me a chance to say as much.  As she introduced the chef's menu and the a la carte menu, she let us know right away that if we wanted to partake of the Chef's Menu but needed to replace an item, we could.  So instead of the Urchin for me, I had the amazing burrata.  \n\nWe were with friends who just had their first visit to the French Laundry a few weeks ago.  Here is their conclusion after having dinner at Commonwealth, \"We never have to go back to the French Laundry.\"  \n\nLovely service.  They don't rush you, they make you feel welcome.\n\nSimple, modern, inviting  atmosphere.\n\nI can't wait to return and bring my parents.  And then, the next visit, other foodie friends.\n\nMy ONLY request - Commonwealth, are you listening?!!  :-)  - the amuse bouche you served us last night...the white dome you created with liquid nitrogen with the delectable salmon tartare...please please don't remove from the menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-13", "description": "Very disappointed in Commonwealth.  My friend and I did the tasking menu with wine pairing--at $115 per person.  The oyster  course was replaced with a muscle course, though very good, we were anticipating the oysters.  I have grown up eating abalone but I couldn't even find the abalone in the second course--it was all mushrooms, the asian pear salad with the highlight of the meal--excellent and interesting.  The lamb course was nothing but a small hunk of fat, I maybe had two bites of actual lamb.  The three bites of pumpkin that accompanied the the lamb was okay, but nothing to write home about.  when the server cleared my plate I graciously commented about the fatty lamb and said i was very surprised the kitchen would serve up such a poor and tiny piece of meat and she said she would let the kitchen know.  The celery sorbet was interesting, buy by no means should celery ever be the centerpiece of a dessert....ever!  The next dessert, was a chocolate ganache and pretzel meringue combination that was just okay and  completely uninspiring.  It felt like they were more interested in presentation and pushing the boundaries of culinary combinations--which I appreciate and respect--but they fell far short on most of the dishes.  The wine pairings were hit and miss with the standout being the last pairing, a sparkling red Brachetto.  At the end of the meal we each ordered a glass of the Branchetto and were served what looked like half a glass (same size at the tasting pour).  We had assumed it was a complementary pour, especially after the bad lamb, but sure enough we were charged $12/glass!  So, after spending over well over $300 for a dinner for two, with a $100 spent on wine alone, we left without even the slightest buzz, completely unsatisfied, still hungry and wondering what all the fuss is about.  Aside from the fact that noting was really done to compensate for the poor lamb, the servers were all quite friendly and engaging.  However, at those prices, there are dozens of other restaurants in the city where one can have a truly excellent and innovative meal and not feel they were ripped off.  Thankfully my dinner companion was excellent company, but I'd recommend you do yourself a favor and spend your pennies elsewhere.", "author": "Erika O."}

Our waitress had even reassured us that there would be far more than enough. However, by the time our entr\u00e9es appeared, we knew the portion sizes would just be enough for one of us. If we knew that we would be getting these tasting portions as entrees, we would have ordered accordingly.  Each dish had at most 2 bites for each of us. Size matters when the half bite is barely enough to carry the burst of flavors.  To be fair, the taste of every dish was extraordinary and had live up to my expectation flavor-wise.  Their gnocchi and marrow stuffed squid dishes were probably unmatched by others in the city. The only dish that needed more work was the fluke crudo with diced fruit bits; it only barely passed the flavor test with very very mild flavors.  All in all, I would come back for the food.

They had their doors unlocked, and people were there (we didn't pick them as 'staff', just folks at the bar) and we were told \"we're not officially open yet\"... okay... well... do you want us to walk around a bit - in the GHETTO AREA OF THE MISSION until you're open or could we maybe pay you to have a glass of wine?? Shoot, we're hungry and thirsty and we're happy to pay to drink wine while we wait.\n\nAnyway... We were seated... ELBOW TO ELBOW with the folks next to us, who we didn't know, but nearly ended up sitting ON. Every time the server would check in with the tables on our sides, we got rear ends in our faces. Which, since we don't know the server, wasn't really appetizing, even if you're into that sort of thing. My non-restaurateur advice is - take out a table or two and open 30 minutes earlier!! It got loud in there once the place filled up, and we literally bashed elbows a few times with our (patient, lovely, foodie) seat-mates.\n\nThe food, for the small to medium plate range, was quite good overall. The housemade chips with a malt vinegar mousse (foamed vinegar mayo?) are tasty and the apps of gnocchi and pumpkin and kale were quite satisfying. Earthy, tangy, harvest-time-ish and the gnocchi were light and fluffy.\n\nThe 'fish' courses of squid + pork belly (I know, not a fish! but with a fish!) and the sweet potato tempura with urchin were ... just good. The urchin had a lot going on with the plate - very sharp flavors contrasting to sublime ones. The squid SMELLED fishy. Not in an appetizing way. Our neighbor (I thought rightly, too) commented that it was like the restaurant was trying to put 'umami' into each dish. \n\nWhich brings us the the pork shoulder. I LOVE MEAT. Sweets and I both BBQ, make our own smoked meats, jerky and etc. Animals are treated with respect in our house as they make their postmortem way to our plates and dishes. This pork shoulder lacked FLAVOR. At first it was hinting of smoke, but then... nothing! No sauce, no glaze, no salt, no nothing! I had to eat it with the beans (that Sweets said tasted canned!) to get a good mojo going in my mouth. It tasted like they tried to \"asian-fy\" pork and forgot the molasses or brown sugar and put in some random flavor instead. Not cool!\n\nDessert was the peanut butter semifreddo - which was good. Solid, neat execution and tasty. But it came with 'frozen popcorn'... which to my tongue, finger, spoon and nose appeared to be frozen whipped cream or butter with salt in it. Um... what!? While it mashed down and complimented the semifreddo, you're serving me butter with salt on a plate. Come on, folks... \n\nServers seemed ok. Busy for midweek. But... they really do get right in your face when they check in on you. I mean, I guess it's hard not to in a cramped place, but... overall it was pretty underwhelming.

The proportion is not big, but for gnocchi, its a bit much for me.\n\nThe scallop was very nice. I liked all the flavors except for the lettuce type used. It was too bitter with the sweet coconut sauce.\n\nMy partner in crime got the sea urchin. He felt he could taste more of the fried batter then the actual sea urchin.\n\nThe lamb shoulder wasn't terribly interesting only because he didn't liked poached meats.\n\nREMEMBER TO BRING YOUR OWN WINE BOTTLE.\n\nThey have great wine selections but corkage here is 15 dollars and you can bring 2 bottles :-)\n\nI'm glad to have tried this place and now its checked off my list.", "author": "Kalifornia S."}

And I have to admit that their cooking IS \nsophisticated, they DO use fresh and special ingredients and they do their best to pair them to create new and elaborated tastes... \n\nThere is a lot of French and other cuisine influence there and they openly say it. \n\nThe problem is that if in France you have a tree course meal and you feel just right at the end it does not happen at Commonwealth. Its portions are not well balanced and they are more tapas to me than regular portions. It also looks like they try a lot, it is not just simple and delicious as VERY GOOD food should be... \n\nWe had the scallops crudo( tastes OK but portion is mainly a snack), Asian pear salad (good), lamb cheeks (OK but I won't go back for them) and another two dishes I forgot the names. We liked the sabayon and the Japanese style desert - it was the best part of it. \nAs for the coffee, cups were unexpectedly huge, it was the most generous serving we saw that evening... \nAnd, if you factor in the portion sizes, this is an expensive restaurant - nothing wrong with it, but you need to be aware.", "author": "VIORICA C."}

We started with the chickpea panisse, that was really our least favorite of everything we tried, but they made up for it with the asparagus & the radish salad.  Each was seasoned perfectly, fresh, and well dressed.  The asparagus had dehydrated black olives on the plate which added a nice complexity to the dish.

We didn't think the peach sorbet and basil granitas had a lot of flavor, but it did cleanse our palates between the sweetbreads and dessert.

A restaurant make?  No, yet a pleasure to feel that all too common stress removed? YES.\nOnce I walked in I was struck by the warmth and I dont mean from the design/decor but rather from the team that work there.  This warmth is felt throughout the entire meal and that is rare.  Some call me way too sensitive to the welcome and all the parts of service and Ill take that and yet if you are too, youll love the intention they put on it.\nThe decor is a bit of a miss and the way they tried to have an open kitchen felt off too.  Id add some color as less is more does not mean nothing and id close the kitchen opening as we want to see in but we dont want to see everything with no chance of missing anything.\nThe food:  I liked it.  I didnt love it but Id say that they do what they do well and they experiment pretty well too.  Even where they miss on the experiment, there is still flavor so you get some sort of dynamic rather then a true miss that just leaves you with palate confusion.  I also appreciated the playfulness in the food ....i think that it works in the mission to be playful like that as the area is about risk, youth and creativity.\nLastly, I liked the people we encountered and since restos are a lot about theatre, that is a good thing.\nthree stars for food and one for vibe, service and ethic.", "author": "Kate S."}

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and chatted cordially with our server as we devoured oddities like duck tongue and lamb cheeks. Both of these dishes, as well as the other dishes we had, were superb and beautifully prepared. In addition to animal face, we also had a mushroom dish, squid and pork belly, and the mackerel, which had actually been changed to sardines for the evening. My boyfriend remarked, \"so this is what sardines are supposed to taste like.\" We had a bottle of really good Spanish wine from their excellent wine list to wash it all down with and also noticed that the corkage fee is only $15, which I think is a pretty sweet price.

The pork shoulder my boyfriend had was delicious, but I was too involved with my lamb breast to fully pay attention.  Yes, it's a little fatty, but as with any piece of meat, that is where all the flavor is.  It was the most perfect lamb breast I've ever had.

We elected to get the Chef's tasting menu and we're excited to start off the night with such a yummy alternative to bread and butter. The first course was a succulent dish of scallops. The scallop was sweet and melted in your mouth, accommodated by a zesty lemon and cut by a creamy avocado puree. Add a finishing touch of tarragon crumble for bite and boy was it good! The next dish, buttered prawns, was my favorite. The cauliflower sauce was so savory and mixed really nicely with the hibiscus addition. The next dish, my least favorite, was a combo of differently prepared beet dishes. I can always appreciate a good beet salad but this was sub par for the price and was underwhelming based on the last two dishes. Sweetbreads were yummy but the thick pieces of pear seemed to take center making the dish feel pieced together. The dessert was good but felt astray from the maturity the previous dishes exhibited.\n\nAll in all, the food was fresh and exotic. The wine pairings could have been a little more in sync with the food but they were still excellent in flavor. The staff could use some improvement. Our server seemed more interested in chatting with their friends at the bar then taking care of us.

They are knowledgeable about what they are serving but not arrogant or too over-suggestive. On mothers day they could have packed the place, but instead layered the reservations so as not to overload the place.\n\nAs for the food, we shared 4 plates and two deserts. The presentation was outstanding, but the 3 of the 4 main plates were a bit under seasoned and lacked a bit in flavor. Perhaps my expectations were too high, and the presentation really set a big stage. Chickpea Panisse to me is a classic dish, and although it was done perfectly, I was expecting something more creative with the flavor. Spring peas was the best dish: subtle, creative texture party with the silken tofu and yoba. Grilled squid and hamhock no I don't recommend it. Perhaps we had such an early seating they didn't have enough time to develop the flavor on this. Lamb shoulder was under seasoned, and not slow cooked enough and therefore not as tender as I would like. Again this may be due to our early seating.

How nice it was to not have to hassle parking, especially with an empty stomach.  We pulled up and parked in Commonwealth's parking lot.  Awesome.  Nothing more annoying than driving around for 45 minutes looking for a spot.\n\nWe didn't have a reservation but were happy to hear from the hostess (who took our jackets upon entering)  that we could sit at the bar, and boy am I glad we did.\n\nMoments after being seated we were greeted by our amazing waitress Lauren.  She explained the way the restaurant works since we were first timers, filled our water glasses and dropped their delicious homemade potato chips in front of us.  No having to ask for anything.... just the way I like it.\n\nShe knew the ins and outs of the menu making it very easy to decide on what we wanted.  She also knew her wines which was great.  I never know which wine goes with what, she made it so easy.  \n\nI had the Gnocchi which was cooked to perfection.  The Scallops were probably the best I have ever had, also cooked to perfection.  My brother had the Kabocha Pumpkin (which I had to try... delicious) and the Pork Shoulder which he raved about the whole way home.  \n\nThe Peanut Butter Semifreddo was a perfect way to finish the meal.  All of the deserts coming out looked great.  I wanted to try them all.\n\nSitting at the bar is a lot of fun for 2-3 people, any more than that and I would say be sure to have a reservation.  Commonwealth will definitely be a place I take my out of town guests to.  Parking, great atmosphere, fantastic help, delicious food, and reasonably priced... what more could you ask for?

For our mains, we had the lamb and the branzino. Both were very good but we both had to say that we loved our starters more.

There were four of us and we basically ordered everything on the ala carte menu.  Started off with an apple salad and a beet salad.  Both really nicely done, light and the flavor combo was very interesting, in a good way.  Second course, was the mushrooms with Douglas fir custard...kind of woodsy, smelled like Christmas but didn't taste like it.  Then Pork belly, sans squid, good with just a hint of spice (a little over cooked but the plate was cleared so it obviously didn't bother us).  Then we had the hen, cooked to perfection with more wonderful flavor combos.  Lastly the pumpkin and kale dish.  So good, I hate Kale but had no problem finishing the last piece.  We ordered one of each for desert as well.  The best is the peanut butter chocolate semifrado with frozen popcorn.  WOW, a party in your mouth!\nOverall, we each had 2-3 glasses of wine with our meal, plus all listed above, with a nice tip dinner was about $85 each.  Not bad for the flavor journey we had.  Can't wait to come back and do the full tasting menu.\nPros: Location, mirror ball in the ceiling, parking lot attached, chips instead of bread, staff was AMAZING.

Like it was reminiscent of the real thing. Smitty got \"an assortment of radishes\" which she said tasted\"like radishes\" HA! The gnocchi was a revelation however.I think it had to be some of the best gnocchi i have ever had, and i almost always order it wherever i go if its on the menu. My steak was chewy and hard to cut.I dont mind it being small and dainty but i would like it to be tender. The flavor of it was okay but i have braces and chewing each piece for 10 minutes wasnt my idea of fun. They dont have cocktails so you are stuck with wine and beer. We had a peanut butter semifreddo which also was delicious and came with frozen popcorn which was something that did cause me to sit and think about how its made and was much more successful than the mousse at the beginning.I think honestly that food is subjective so perhaps many others will love this restaurant.I just was left with a feeling that i was gonna get a happy ending but all i got was an actual massage.", "author": "Jim M."}

For $100 a tasting menu on par with any of the michelin stared places in the city and an expert wine pairing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-25", "description": "Firstly, I should say that I am not a fan of molecular gastronomy, and I think that it's silly and pretentious. I can sort of see why other people may enjoy having food that has been broken down into the elements it contains, then reconstituted back into something that resembles the original food, but I myself don't see the appeal. I most enjoy food that is prepared as simply as possible, in order to taste as good as it possibly can. And although Commonwealth is not truly a molecular gastronomy restaurant, it uses some of the techniques in its dishes, and another thing that's common with a molecular gastronomy place is its portions are miniscule. And when I say \"miniscule\", I do not just mean \"small\". Yes, they're artfully arranged on the plate, and they use ingredients and cooking techniques that are unusual and sometimes interesting. But I think those prices can only be justified if, when you have exactly 3 bites on the plate, each bite just blows you out of the water, but that's not the case at Commonwealth. All of the dishes we had there were pretty good, a couple were really good (I liked the oysters and the slow cooked egg), the rest were ok, but I didn't particularly like them. The dessert we had (peanut butter chocolate semifreddo) tastes exactly like the little PB chocolate waffle bites I get from Trader Joes and keep in the freezer, no kidding. \nService is mostly thoughtful and timely, although my experience was somewhat soured when one of the girls wiping the table between courses spilled some pulverized reconstituted powdered something-or-other ON MY DRESS, then mumbled \"oh, sorry, I just totally spilled that all over you\", and walked away. So have a nice life, Commonwealth, but we won't be seeing each other again.", "author": "Sushi M."}

I've heard a lot about Jason Fox and was already biased toward a 4-5 star rating.  Alas, I was to be disappointed.  Objectively, the restaurant is in an emerging location of the Mission...  (Should have invested in some property on this street!).  The interior is ok and one can tell that money was saved here, but the place was packed with mid 20's-30's crowd.  All hipsters and surprising good looking girls that you'd only expect to find in West LA (yes... married, but not blind).  The price is outrageously reasonable for what the restaurant is attempting to deliver.  There is a bit of molecular gastronomy and seasonal veggies.  The service is friendly and food comes out quickly.  However what is lacking is flavor.  None of my courses impressed.  While I find this place more interesting than Frances in terms of the vibe, location and people, the food is just as flat as Frances.  I think at this price point, I would direct people to Sons and Daughters.  Maybe I am getting too jaded in my old age.  I'd come back here and sit at the bar perhaps and eat an entree but it's not where I would send people to have a memorable meal.  I am sure my review would have more generous if this restaurant was not already so hyped....  Still, it's still has to be a 3 star restaurant for me.  Good prices/value/cool spot despite the average food.", "author": "Laurence H."}

And, wow, were we glad we did. We got the fixed price tasting menu with wine pairing, and spent the next two hours in culinary bliss. There were interesting things in the menu that had I been ordering a la carte I never would have ordered, like the sea urchin in a Japanese inspired corn soup with American Southwestern flavors. Not in a million years would I have expected to like this, but it was divine! I ate a salmon sashimi dish with roe and horseradish cream, again, not something I would have expected to love, but it was fantastic. They froze the horseradish cream in a dome over the salmon, roe, and miner's lettuce (a wild foraged herb), and balanced the temperatures, flavors, and texture so perfectly, I would not have changed a thing. My winemaker friend, being the expert wine palate, praised their wine selections and pairings, saying only that he would have liked to have paid more to have a slightly more expensive level of pairings, but that the wines they did pair were good and kept the prices reasonable. And the dessert. Oh my, the dessert. It was a peanut butter semifreddo on a chocolate cookie crust, covered in a perfect shell of chocolate, and a stripe of caramel sauce. I ate mine and half of my friend's. It was the best dessert I've ever had. Mostly because it is everything I love in a dessert, peanut butter, ice cream, cookie and chocolate, but I will say that their balance, execution, and presentation were perfect. And I won't forget how good the service was, either. The team on the floor worked together seamlessly, and were personable without being intrusive. Just the right amount of attentiveness. I will be going back again and spreading the word, not that Commonwealth has been at a loss for customers!", "author": "Colleen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-07", "description": "Did the tasting menu with my wife last night, and had one of the best dining experiences I have had in some time.  Julia was our server and I would certainly recommend her and will ask for her when I return.  I get very emotional in restaurants, as I have worked in them all of my professional life.  Sometimes this emotion is negative, like when I run into reconstituted tofu or anything by Rocco Dispirito, and sometimes it is intensely positive, like drinking a Grof Degenfeld Tokaji with Rogue River Blue Cheese.  Commonwealth was certainly the latter.  \n\nLet me start with the prices.  They are unbelievable!  6-course tasting menu that is really 8 courses for $65?  Unreal.  I did read a couple of reviews from some folks complaining about price and portion size, and to you jokers let me say:  there is a restaurant called Claim Jumper that you are really going to like.\n\nThe key to any restaurant is people who care intensely about what they are doing acting with intentionality.  This was clear in every aspect of my experience last night.  It was not perfect, which I will get into below, but the people there were excited about what they were doing and it showed.\n\nWe started with the 'Lumberjack' which was their dry-ice formed cocktail.  This really set the stage with nice contrasts of sweet and winter spice, and pillowy ice crystals formed from the ultra-cold preparation contrasting with the pop and crunch of pomegranate kernels.  Someone had obviously spent some time thinking about this drink.\n\nThe tasting menu greeted us with a couple of amuses, which were quite good but I won't detail here, because I really want to get into the Foie Gras Bon Bons.  This dish was a foie mousse as the center of chocolate bon bons with cooked quince and cracked Szechuan pepper.  It was served with a fortified Grenache Blanc from Domaine Fontanel.  I like to taste components first, but in this case I put one of each component on my fork and let the flavors do their thing.  The layers of flavor were intense, with the strong chocolate eventually giving way to the rich foie, and the wine pairing was as good as I have had in the last year.  My only complaint was that I wasn't getting enough foie flavor, so I then cut one of the bon bons open and ate half of it with the other components.  the exposed foie mousse changed an excellent dish into a transcendent one and I literally had tears in my eyes (told you I get emotional).\n\nWhile the foie is what I will be talking about for years to come, the rest of the menu was outstanding as well.  The Jerusalem Artichoke is not to be missed, and was my second favorite item of the night.  The scallop dish was competent, but fell short of the high standard that had been set before it.  The quail dish was quite good, but the chicories were over-salted, and the quail was under-salted.  I ate them together and then everything tasted great.  The peanut butter semifreddo may be the most underrated item on the menu (judging from the yelp reveiws).  I thought it was quite good, but when I put the frozen popcorn on top of it and ate everything together, it went to another level entirely.\n\nI was as impressed by the wine list as I was by the menu.  I can truly say that I have never seen such a short list be so incredibly compelling.  I do this for a living and I only recognized about 50% of the list, and like the restaurant it was all reasonably priced and competently explained.  The wine steward, Xelina, who I think is also the general manager, did an outstanding job giving info on the wine.  We indicated early on that we were interested in some back and forth about wine, and she did not disappoint.  She also gave a ton of credit to the Somm, Sarah, who apparently is the bartender as well.  I agree with Xelina--Sarah should be very proud of what she has done.  \n\nCommonwealth is not perfect, but it is close.  It is full of people who love what they are doing and their craft shows.  In my opinion this restaurant is on the verge of even more attention than they have already received--get in while you still can.", "author": "Adam L."}

Rabbit was cooked to perfection and wine pairing was the perfect accompaniment to the meal. They have their own parking lot which is always a plus in the city. The vibe is classy and hipster at the same time. The servers were very friendly, knowledgeable, and really provided excellent service. If you're paying $100 per person for their tasting menu, I expect nothing but perfection. Indeed perfection was what we got. Our anniversary could not have gone any better thanks to our delicious meal and wine. We started off with an amuse- bouche followed by a wonderfully, well-put-together salad, then caviar, then proceeded with the rabbit, got mouthful orgasms from their oat-crusted foie gras, then topped it off with a cherry sorbet and semifreddo--all paired with a glass of different wines. I can honestly say that this is one of the best places I've eat at here at home and I'd love to go back to try something else on their menu.

Honestly, my friend and I walked some distance to find and try this restaurant. What a disappointment.  First of all, the prices appear to be reasonable, but!  the portions are actually tapas sized, which makes them rather pricey per bite.  To make matters worse, these morsels are served on plates that are like turkey platters.  Perhaps I was too preoccupied with not having anything fall off the overcrowded little table.... but nothing I ate caught my attention as anything special.  The free homemade potato chips that are served while you wait for your order are tasty. After that, it was downhill.... something akin to a luge run.

Food was great, though perhaps a little on the light side. Started with Porcini churros, which were better than I expected. I had a tomato salad and my date had the gnocchi. They were both delicious, esp the gnocchi. Then I had the halibut and my date had the chicken & prawns. Both dishes were prepared perfectly. Then I had the 'white russian' dessert which had coffee ice cream, vodka gelee and genoise cake (with cocoa nibs?) and my date had the deconstructed smores. Both were yummy and we left placated, though it took dessert to barely fill me up. All in all, I would go back, with friends and other people I wanted to impress.

Goat roasted in hay?  Lamb tongue?  I commend them for veering from the same old. I also admire the charitable efforts.  However, this was truly one of the worst meals I have had in San Francisco in years.\n**Service:  Friendly but incredibly slow.  We waited an eternity for wine, ordering, our food.  She literally forgot our wine order and came back to ask us what we wanted again.\n**Food:  The food was average at best.  The stuffed peppers were decent, the gnocchi was pleasant and the rest was not great but not terrible.  There was no flavor profile that was memorable or would make me want to necessarily come back but up until the entrees, I wasn't terribly unhappy.  Then we got the entrees: black cod with some kind of chocolate/almond foam and Young Hen with Spotted Prawns.  The cod was literally inedible.  It was the most vile tasting thing ever. It was simultaneously bitter and sour and the texture was very glutenous. I was actually shocked a restaurant would put out something that tasted like that.  I can't speak to the hen because I literally didn't want to put one more bite in my mouth after that but my tablemates did not enjoy the hen either.\nThey were very kind and took the cod off the bill but any restaurant that could let something that tastes like that out the door has some serious work to do.\nI hope they improve their game and it is very early, so hopefully they will.", "author": "Elisa L."}

We were off to a good start with the seaweed sprinkled potato chips that were provided in lieu of bread.  (The gooey vinegar dip we could do without though.)  Our orders came 2 at a time to accommodate the narrow table.  Scallop crudo was good but I did not understand the idea behind the tiny rock sugars sprinkled on top of the scallops so I simply brushed them off.  The sea urchin custard was delicious with a generous portion of the yellow goo :-).  The pork belly and baby squid as well as the sweetbread (that was on the tasting menu only but our server was able to serve it to us as an a .a carte dish) were also quite scrumptious.  The squash blossom with the soup and the lamb cheeks were beyond our expectations.  The only unhappy dish for us was the macha meringue dessert with it's odd consistency.  The only explanation we can think of is that it's a molecular experimentation gone south.  Overall, a great place to go and we're looking forward to visiting again, maybe next month when they change their menu items.", "author": "Yvette F."}

Businesses have learned that the rent is cheaper and rich hipsters like expensive grunge. I came hear instead of going to Mission Chinese Food, which was closed. Commonwealth is small, like many other Mission digs, but seats many people in a not-too-squished way. My hubbie and I opted to sit at the bar, which I totally recommend. We were able to watch the kitchen antics perfectly, and it felt like more of a show in artistic and scientific creation than a dining experience. The prices were low compared to what I'd expected for the ambiance, but we tend toward ordering fewer items than most people so that we can eat out more often. That said, we tried the gnocchi, which was amazing, and the compressed watermelon and tofu mousse-thing, which was not. Other dishes that we saw being prepared, such as the caprese salad-thing were crazy gorgeous, and worth ordering I bet. I tend not to order foods that I think I could make at home, but some of these dishes (even with simple ingredients) were so beautiful that it seemed worth the experience.

I have to say, that while the food was quite tasty it wasn't as mind-blowing as I thought it would be based on the reviews. The gnocchi was quite good, but overall the portion sizes were very small and I'm a petite person that really appreciates smaller portions. I think there is a bit of a communication issue with the way the menu appears and what is ultimately delivered. I think they could be more explicit in saying all their dishes are basically tapas portion sizes. My fiance and I usually order one dessert and split it, but seeing as how the portion sizes were so small and I was still hungry, we decided to get two desserts, which was a good call because they were also smaller in size. The service was very friendly and professional, no complaints there. Our server suggested a nice bottle of wine which we really liked. I do appreciate the socially conscious nature of the business, especially that they donate some of the proceeds to charity.

A bowl of home made potato chips is a surprise substitute for bread. Porcini churros, scallop crudo and all vegetable dishes are mouth watering.Can't wait to be back especially now that I know there is a parking lot available to restaurant guests.", "author": "Anna R."}

Yes, service is flawless and every course we had was delightful!  From the crispy pig's ears, to the desserts (loved the \"white russian\", even w/out the vodka gelee addition).  Hen and prawn - sweet/savory hen, but the prawn was a bit \"mealy\".  Fluke crudo - delicate and just divine.  Gnocchi was a big hit - so light and fluffy - truffles were the perfect addition.  And I could eat every day the stuffed squid with marrow!!  The only problem we ALL had was that when we left, our clothes were permeated with the scent of food - no ventilation what so ever in the restaurant!!   Sad, but true.....though will not us from returning (jeans it will be)", "author": "Barbara C."}

The waitress even brushed the crumbs off the table after each serving (the slob that I am).  The food was really yummy.  We had mackerel, kabocha pumpkin, and beet root with homemade goat cheese.  Every bite was delicious.  We only have two complaints.  The portions are a bit on the small end.  In a way, we get it.  Each bite is to be explored and savored.  That's a good thing.  Nevertheless, I could've used a few more bites.  Second, and this is the more significant of the complaints, the space was cold.  It's about 50 degrees in San Francisco this evening, and there were very, very few people who did not remove their jackets and hats in the space.  Had it been warmer, I think it would've received a 5-stars from me.  I am definitely a fan, but I probably won't be rushing back until the Spring.", "author": "chad H."}

While not a bad concept, few seem to be successful in producing a great dining experience. Some like Saison and Commis pull it off beautifully, while others like Sons & Daughters make you feel like kids just received their inheritance and decided it would be cool to open a restaurant to impress their friends. Commonwealth unfortunately falls into the latter category. The setting is retro diner and very stark and cold ( my dining companion wore her coat throughout our meal), situated in the middle of a neighborhood that makes you worry about the likelihood of finding your car sitting atop of blocks without wheels after you return from dinner. Thankfully, they have a private lot for parking. The staff is very friendly and appears well informed, but unfortunately, they can not make up for the internal and external surroundings and poor execution of the food. While I appreciate the creative approach to the food, it appears that the kitchen staff does not understand how to put flavors together in an appealing way, and should concentrate on basic cooking technique. An example would be that my guests lamb had decent (though unremarkable) flavor, but was overcooked and dry. The pork belly in my dish of Squid and pork belly was also overcooked which is not easy to do with a protein that is so high in fat. It would seem that the chef is so intent on achieving carmelization of the meat that they have forgotten that the moisture content is equally important. Near the end of our me we did have an interesting conversation with the couple seated next to us when they politely asked for recommendations for dessert. As it turns outline myself they too eat in many places in the city and where disappointed in the food and could not understand what appeal this restaurant has to offer. Perhaps Commonwealth should consider the fact that there are likely many similar conversations that take place when you sit strangers 18\" apart from each other. The staff at Commonwealth were very gracious to us, but unfortunately the experience at Commonwealth is far to common these days with new \"hip\" restaurants in the city.", "author": "Ralph K."}
