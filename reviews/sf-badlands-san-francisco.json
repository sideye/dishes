We took a seat at the bar and the bartender, David, handsome and smiling from ear-to-ear asked what he could get us. We told him we wanted a GREAT margarita and that's exactly what he prepared for us. Since it was a 2 for 1 price, we ordered another round, and this is going to be hard to believe, but David prepared an even better margarita! Needless to say we left Badlands feeling content and happy. A great margarita is hard to find at a great price.", "author": "Clare H."}

It was in a pocket outside of the bag (the guy who saw my iphone x didn't see this phone because he didn't check that pocket). Put the pieces together guys! On the other hand, this place could also be filled with regular pickpocketers who just steal iphones on the daily.\n\nTheir drinks suck.

I don't yell at you as my customers so don't yell at me!\" In a dumbfounded awe I started at him thinking is this really happening? Did he just get mad because I asked him for a beer? I paid cover to get in and not 5 minutes into the venue I'm being attacked. I then responded saying I'm not sure what to do if you're not serving me after 5 minutes of being the only person at the bar waiting that's not my fault. He then responded with \"Well why would I serve you if you don't TIP?!\" \n\nOK first off tip isn't mandatory that's why it's called a tip. Secondly I ALWAYS tip for good service as a professional dog groomer I LIVE off tips and understand these people do too. And once again this was my FIRST time at the bar getting my FIRST DRINK. \n\nSo I then proceeded with telling him I haven't even ordered a drink it's my first time up here.  He then said \"Well none of your friends tipped so I can assume the same from you from the people you hang with\" ARE YOU SH*TTING ME?! What gives you the right to talk to anyone like that, especially a patron. I then told him that you can't judge me based on other people's actions. He then apologized and asked what I wanted. But I'm still literally in shock from what just occurred..I politely ordered my Corona and left a tip. I had half a mind not to but in my better judgement to not prove him right (despite his obviously offensive and rude service) I left $1 for my $4 corona.\n\nI then left and spoke to the doorman asking for the manager and instead he talked to me.

Two of the bartenders descended on me and started shouting angrily and pointing in my face telling me to leave.  When I tried to ask them why they just kept shouting \"NO!  NO!  You need to leave!!\"  \nIt was such an angry reaction.  They then told the two bouncers to have me dragged out and they called the police. \nY'all.. I was just dancing for 30 seconds without a shirt on. \nI can't tell you how much a slap in the face it was to be in a queer bar, literally have shirtless men dancing unmolested next to me, and yet to be treated with such outrage and disdain for doing the same exact thing.\n\nI've taken my shirt off a couple times at other clubs in the Castro but the bartenders and patrons did not so much as bat an eye.  I felt welcome and comfortable.  \nBadlands just helped remind me that women are not equal.", "author": "Chelsea D."}

This is where you want to go.\n\nMy wife's sister came to SF on a surprise visit and this is what we chose on a random Thursday. Yeah yeah, it's a gay bar in the gay district of town. If you can't get over that, then this isn't the place for you. It's cash only and the music was hit or miss, but here's a few things this club had in spades:\n\n- The bartenders at this place are on a mission to get you wasted, and I mean shitfaced (are we allowed to say that?). I ordered a vodka tonic and instead received a cup of vodka with 3 ice cubes, a splash of tonic and a tiny lime wedge. Shots are cheap. Dirt cheap. I think we had a few shots of whiskey and tequila, but I can't be sure anymore. \n- Since it's primarily a gay bar, your woman is free to completely skank out without fear of creepers. On the other hand, be prepared for some wholly inappropriate looks, grabs, and other shenanigans especially once the booze has been flowing for a while... and I mean, for you, as the male.\n- All in all it's got a safe vibe and the Castro neighborhood is great for things to do afterwards, be it more drinks, food, or if you and your woman want to have some fun at home (there's a sex shop around the corner).\n\nMy wife and I were literally rolling around in the street later that night and had to climb into our Uber. Not sure when her sister got home but she apparently met a straight guy and got lucky. My wife and I woke up naked and we had trashed the bedroom. \n\nI only remember fragments of that episode, but it must've been awesome. \n\nTake your women to this place and experience it at least once. There's something about how the guys stare at you like a piece of meat that drives women crazy. I basically got my clothes torn off the second we got home.", "author": "Byron E."}

But, as an owner, if you are aware that your customers are not high class and you serve them cheap booze, then you must pay even more attention to at least safety of your patrons. However, the security is non-existent there. \nI wonder why no one sued the whole place yet for such negligence.", "author": "Dimi N."}

All this time, I'd been trying so hard to veer off the beaten path, that I forgot about the existence of the beaten path itself.  \n\nGo figure.\n\nAnywho, my friend was desperately wanting to take away my Badlands virginity, but with our nightclubbin' days steadily fading into the past, neither of us were in the mood to be out dancing 'til 2am.  While Badlands may be first-and-foremost a dancing spot, we discovered that it also has a killer happy hour.  Just come early, skip the lines and cover, sit back, relax, and enjoy the dirt-cheap 2-for-1 drink special -- so much better than the typical, overheated Badlands experience.  (The drinks pack a wallop, too.)\n\nThe vibe is quintessential Castro.  Gaga, Britney, and Kylie on endless repeat?  Check.  Bartenders with hefty doses of sass and bitchiness?  Double-check.  \n\nThe clientele is an interesting mix.  It's mostly locals, but confused tourists and the occasional homeless dude or tweaker wanders in too.  (There's a bouncer, but he doesn't actually do anything that resembles checking IDs or weeding out riffraff.  I think he's just for show, since he comes inside to have drinks every 15 minutes or so.)\n\nAlso -- right before we left, I overheard a geriatric dude (with a walker!) offering a bartender $100 to go home with him.   The bartender said no.  \n\nBetter luck next time, I guess....", "author": "David G."}

On Friday it was super busy and I was warned to keep my purse zipped up and beware of thieves. There was a $3 cover charge and the establishment accepts cash only. The dance floor reeked of B.O and sweat and was ridiculously packed. The bartender poured shots of tequila when fireball was ordered and mixed up a different cocktail than the blueberry Cosmo that was asked for. Bathrooms were disgusting and had sketchy activities taking place for people to look in on through the glass window on the door.

Close your eyes and imagine a gay bar and this place is what you see.\n\nThis is an idyllic wonderland of all ages, genders, ethnicities, tropes:  if you're into it, you'll find it here.  Muscular Vietnamese jocks?  Check.  Mustachioed Italian leather daddies?  Check.  Tattooed Chicana dykes?  Check.  Puerto Rican cha-chas? Check.\n\n$3 Cover and $4 Lagunitas IPAs on a weekend night?  Whoa.  \n\nSome of my fellow Yelpers grouse about the music, but in keeping with the \"something for everyone\" vibe of the place, playing to the least common denominator is to be expected.   I for one am getting pretty tired of DJ personality cults playing their Balinese inspired zydeco dubstep, so I think it's great to find a place that will play Madonna, Kylie Manogue and C&C Music Factory without even the slightest hint of irony.  \n\nMagical moment came when they played Capital Cites Safe and Sound and the entire place erupted in joy.  An odd choice for a dance club, right?  But then, consider the lyrics:\n\n\nI could lift you up\nI could show you what you wanna see\nAnd take you where you wanna be\nYou could be my luck\nEven if the sky is falling down\nI know that we'll be safe and sound\nWe're safe and sound!\n\nSums up how one feels when in Badlands perfectly.

I was with my boyfriend and we ordered two BOTTLED beer from the bartender. I pay and step away. He keeps staring at us.... finally he works up the courage to ask if we were new.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-21", "description": "Visiting San Francisco for four days during this summer with my boyfriend, I had to do my own pilgrimage at SF's Gay neighborhood : El Castro.\n\nYay, It's so clich\u00e9 but a Gay boy needs his fun and San Francisco is a great excuse for going out every night.\n\nAfter walking randomly to several places and reading numerous reviews on Yelp, I decided to try Badlands on Friday. No cover.\nAnd let me tell you, you Gay guys from SF have a good place there. \nWent back on Saturday, this time there's a 6$ cover. It was already packed around 10:30 on both nights with people from all age, gender, and social classes. That's a good point and It gives energy to the party.\n\nImportant detail that is so vital to me : They have a coat-check. It's only 2$ and the guy working there is friendly and smiling. I'm so glad they have one because let's be real, It's cold in San Francisco and bar/clubs with no coat-checks force me to get there without any coat and I get sick the next day. Take that into account L.A ! Not everybody likes to be wearing only a T-shirt at night when It's only 60 degrees outside to go to a club...\n\nBut back to Badlands :\n\nThis place is big, It's composed of 3 spaces : \n1-A bar area where they serve good drinks (8$ for a Vodka/Redbull)\n2- A place with a few chairs and tables where you can sit and chat.\n3-And finally a small dance-floor. \nThey have 3 restrooms which is a lot for one bar. One of them is close to the dance-floor and is totally in the dark. \nDid not try this one, this would be an open invitation if you know what I mean...\n\nThe setting has nothing special, just your typical Gay bar with bright lights.\nThere are TVs everywhere playing music videos of the songs that the Dj is spinning. The music is top 40's + Classics like Whitney Houston, Earth Wind & Fire, Michael Jackson with some Rihanna, Ke$ha (They seems to love her which is fine to me as I don't hear much of her songs in other clubs) and Britney. \nI like clubs using videos, I think It brings energy and people tend to move their body more in those places. I love dancing to Top 40's songs and seeing other people reacting to the video or even reacting it. It's a good feeling that creates conversations and get people to dance with each other. \nWhat do you want more from a Gay club ?\n\nOh and no go-go boys there. \nThat's kind of a good thing to me as It sometimes takes away the attention from what I think is the most important in clubbing : dancing and meeting new people. The crowd is diverse, all ethnicities and nationalities, some friendly girls but Badlands is not invaded by straight dudes or bachelorettes, the worst enemies of a good gay scene. \n\nJust a note for my party boys, I have to admit that the competition can become tough when It comes to find a good-looking masculine top in there, not many of them and a lot of starving bottoms. \nSo put your freakum dress on Honey, you have to fight to get a good one there !\n\nWish there was some Drag Show at Badlands when I was there. It would have made this place almost perfect.\n\nHere is the small detail I don't like about this place and that I still don't get : No mirrors at all. \nYes, no glass, no mirror, no place to look at a stranger's reflection, checking you're still looking good...\nGirl, this is not OK. \nThis might sound a bit over the top but I still don't get why there's no mirror at Badlands. And please don't tell me It's because It's a \"non-ego\" bar. \nThis is a Gay bar, drama and ego keep it alive !\n\nI'll bring my own when coming back there for sure. \nThose were good times at Badlands.", "author": "Marc S."}

(Yes, I know I'm a bad person for NOT going to Castro, but I finally made it out there!)\n\nFirst all, my friend mentioned that happy hour was the entire day up until around dinner time, since that's when the dance floor opens up. Walking into the bar/club around 5 PM, it wasn't busy at all, just a few people here and there, enjoying themselves with their happy hour drink.\n\nI'm usually bad at what kind of drinks to order, since I'm not a big drinker, but I do have a few safety drinks, in case of these times. Lucky for me, I saw my drink posted on the paper flyer that was plastered all over the back wall, the infamous Lemon Drop. My friend failed to mentioned to me that happy hour here means that it's buy one get one free drinks.\n\nA bit strong for my taste, but then again, I kind of lost that strongness after half of the first cup. Not a bad place to chill out after a class, after a long day's of work, or starting to get that buzz going on. Kind of want to see how the place is at night, with the dance floor open.\n\nMusic selection was mostly pop, a combination of both old and new. I did know a few songs here and there, and was surprised to see music videos of songs that I do know, thanks to the radio. (Just a random FYI, I'm more into K-Pop, if you don't know that already, so I'm REALLY out of the loop when it comes to American pop).", "author": "Tom T."}

We used Yelp to help us find a fun club to dance at during our last night here in San Fran. I was a little afraid at first because the reviews weren't that great and people were complaining about phones and money being stolen right out of their wallets and pockets! \n\nWhen we got there, there was a $3 cover. They also gave you a warning paper about the thieves that roam the club. Now onto the place, holy crap is it busy. You can barely move or dance. It doesn't help that it's not too too big inside either. The overcrowdedness almost made me rate the club only three stars, however, the drinks, bartenders and music swayed me. Drinks were reasonable. I paid around $6 for a long island. Music was awesome! Old and new school pop. And the bartenders were the friendliest I've ever experienced ANYWHERE. Considering the place is crazy, I expected them to be at wits end. Nope, they kept their cool. \n\nI would love to come back during my next Trip to San Fran, but maybe on a different night when it's not as crazy.", "author": "Aj S."}

I had arrived early enough in the evening that I didn't get a piece of tree, reminding me to keep an eye out for thieves, but I'm somewhat of a regular at Badlands, so I have only myself to blame for not being more cognizant of my surroundings. I had been consuming judgment impairing liquids, and I'd bet that's the objective of most Badlands customers.

Once the night picked up though, it was fun to be in that area. They have the music videos of the songs playing while the song is which was nice. There are also two dancers dancing while the club is really alive and I found myself to enjoy what I was looking at.

Yes, there was no space to dance and it smelled like a locker room. I guess that might turn on some guys but not me.... In some ways there was no point to be here. Instantly a club turned into a mere bar with frolicking sardines that were wriggling around to the sounds of Lady Madonna or was it Gagadonna? Anyway, the drinks here are cheap but according to the Targetera they use cheap liquor :( Not good!\n\nI found out they call this place Sadlands.... because,\"you go to the club on your own, and you leave on your own, and you go home and you cry and you want to die...(The Smiths). At least that is one account from a local friend called Balle.

The music was somewhat better than in WeHo! Another plus - they allow ins and outs! I actually did enjoy myself but once again we came here to DANCE!\n\nMy question to you boys out there is: Does it seem to you that the Castro is not as WOW as you would think?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-21", "description": "This is still my favorite dance bar in San Francisco. The music IS  reliable with vocals rather than that techno crap that drones on at so many gay events in The City or the rap you often have to endure at straight clubs. There are monitors around the dance floor and a video d.j. mixes the vids. I am not an alcohol drinker so can't say much about the drinks. My biggest complaint about Badlands is the same complaint I have had about other gay bars. All of us have our straight women that we love but is it really necessary to bring them to the gay club? It seems to me that a lot of young gay men are terrified of other gay men and it looks like they bring their girls to protect them? I don't pretend to understand the need of some gay men to bring straight women to a gay bar. It FEELS like they are \"slumming,\" -a \"zoo\" mentality. The girls giggle & squeal at the gay men that were in the bathroom when they went to use it. OMG! Squeal. Giggle. It is really annoying. IF you are a gay man that insists on bringing straight women to a gay bar, I would just like to suggest some etiquette for you to convey to her. These apply to any gay dance bar, not just Badlands:\n\n1. Tell your straight bff to leave her coat at home, in the car or CHECK IT! Do NOT put your coats in the middle of the dance floor. Do not dance in a group around a pile of coats!! \n\n2. Do not bring a purse to a gay bar! Leave your purse, backpack, luggage or whatever it is that you are carrying, at home or leave it in the car. Someone trying to dance with a big purse under their arm just looks stupid!! (AND then you won't be whining about your cell phone getting stolen out of your purse! BTW, leave your cell in the car or at home too. You don't need it in a gay bar! You only need an ID and cash.)\n\n3. Do not take your drinks onto the dance floor! Yes, you may see gay men bringing their drinks onto the dance floor but they really shouldn't either! Drink the drinks while your chatting with friends. There are little ledges & tables on which you can leave your drinks while dancing. You do not need those drinks with you on the dance floor! If you have a drink in your hand, are you really \"dancing\" anyway? (Some gay men are highly skilled at drinking on the dance floor but they have been practicing for years. YOU should not do it!!! You will spill it all over the floor and others near you!!)\n\n4. Do not line dance, square dance, swing dance, ballroom dance or any other kind of dancing that entails holding your partners hand & swinging them around the dance floor, knocking over all the other dancers. This is considered sloppy and rude behavior! Contain yourself in your personal space on the dance floor and avoid throwing yourself into other dancers. \n\n5. No \"parking\" on the dance floor. You are taking up space from those that actually want to dance. \n\n6. Don't dance in group circles. It's really obnoxious. \n\n7. IF you are a straight women & bring your straight bf to the gay bar, you are responsible for him & his behavior!  PLEASE do not feel you have to prove to everyone that your bf is straight by sticking your tongue down his throat. If you want to make out with your straight bf, go to a straight bar or get a room. Look around- Do you see gay men making out on the dance bar? Probably not. So why would you think we all want to watch two straight people making out- AND PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, if you MUST have some tongue, at least get off the dance floor!!! \n\n8. No slow dancing in a gay dance club. Yuck. No \"break dancing!\" No dancing that entails laying down on the floor. Save all of that for the straight bar, please. \n\n9. We know how much straight women love coming to gay bars. There is a reason for this- they are GAY bars!! Hello? IF you are a straight woman that likes coming to gay bars, please don't come back by yourself with your straight boyfriend, regardless of how \"liberal\" he is or a group of your straight women friends! You should consider it a privilege that your \"gay\" brought you to the gay bar in the first place. You shouldn't think that it is now okay for you to bring all your straight friends to goggle the \"gays.\" We are not there for your amusement. A gay bar should not feel like a zoo. Gay bars are not a place for you to \"slum.\"  There is nothing that ruins a gay bar faster than a lot of straight people! If you love hanging out with straight people, go to the straight bar where you can dance in a group around a pile of coats and purses and spill your drinks all over the dance floor. \n\n10. Lastly, straight women should not dance like they are a stripper on a pole trying to seduce someone with their hotness. Remember, this is a gay bar! Nobody is interested in how your breasts heave and your ass twerks.  Only gay men can get away with those moves in a gay bar because they look \"cute\" doing it. Straight women just look desperate. If you need a meat rack atmosphere, go to a straight dance club where all those \"sexy\" moves will be appreciated!!", "author": "S. R."}

It's cheap and that's all that matters if you're just warming up for the night. It can get a bit crowded around the bar, but that's typical.\n\nThere's a dance floor in the back, but the music didn't sound that fabulous the Friday night I was there. Not sure if it was the DJ's fault or just the standard.\n\nThere is a creepy dark bathroom that's the alternative to the bathroom with 1 toilet and 1 urinal. Both are disgusting, but if you should choose, I say always go into the one that has lights.\n\nI would probably come back here just for the cheap drinks. Not exactly the hot spot after happy hour.", "author": "Shawn B."}

Drinks aren't too expensive and are strong to my liking. I like how they have a good selection to choose from.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-06", "description": "Oh gosh, what can you say about Badlands...\n\nIt's perhaps one of the most popular bars in the Castro area, at least with my friends, but there's only one real reason -- the booze.  They have a heavy hand here, and their 2-4-1 deal (now it's buy 1, get one for $1?) is renowned for getting the job done.  Still, it's not the \"prettiest\" place.  Nor is it the cleanest.  It has the aura of a gay bar that needs a facelift, but you quickly forget that as you watch the music videos which are bound to be on one of their dozen and a half television monitors.\n\nSome tips:\n\nTIP:  Though happy hour happens every day and usually goes until 8 or 8:30pm, it is subject to change depending on how thick the crowd is -- it may end up lasting later, but it'll never end early.\n\nTIP:  Your bartender of choice should be Alex.  He is an Asian guy that's usually at the closest station to the entrance.  He and the entire staff are really pretty good at making quality cocktails (e.g., you'll get drunk), but he is unique in that he will likely remember you and your drink even after weeks of not visiting.\n\nTIP:  Different days have different crowds.  The most popular day for a gathering of 20-30-40 yro locals would be Thursday.  In fact, you probably can't show up on a Thursday without knowing someone that's already there.  Stay through Happy Hour, then go take a dinner break, and there's a second rush around 10pm.  It'll be packed until 12/1am.  Fridays and Saturdays tend to be a different story; still heavily gay (grin), but the bridge and tunnel folks, as well as a lot of straight women, tend to come on these days.\n\nOverall, I give this place a 3.75 out of 5.  I suggest to the owner that he take a week or two and give this place a mean scrub down and facelift.", "author": "Bryan H."}

I've been here twice now and both times I have had a wonderful time.\n\nCover is always $3 and you always need to bring cash for you alcoholic needs since it's a cash only bar. Usually I pay about $7 for a mixed drink which is really not bad at all. Often they have specials going on too which are always yummy and cheap.\n\nLast weekend, I decided to bring my boyfriend and he had an amazing time. He was really unsure about going at first, but several shots later he was fist pumping like crazy on the dance floor. He even made friends with several gays from Europe when he was using the bathroom while I got hit on by a lovely lesbian outside waiting for him. Loveeee it!\n\nThe vibe here is so great, everyone is really friendly without crossing any boundaries. Every time I come here, I meet new people and dance until I'm literally about to pass out.  \n\nThe only downside is that the dance floor is quite limited. I definitely accidentally bump into people a lot as I'm grinding on my gays or my boyfriend. \n\nOther than that though, the bartenders are great, the people are great, and 90% of the time I enjoy the music they play.

I was dancing on the dance floor and a belligerent drunk man began getting aggressive with me.  I hate confrontation so I walked away; however, I didn't want to stop dancing just because of one idiot. Since I was there alone from out of town.  I'm not quite the city slicker so I asked the bar tenders to keep an eye on that guy and of course please watch my back.  Well they grabbed that guy and threw him out so fast.

One thing I gotta admit: though I went here knowing good and well that my chances of meeting a decent straight man would be about 10x worse than they already are at any other club, it still broke my heart a little to watch the look-alike of a past crush of mine make out with a guy he had just met.

We were here to celebrate my GF's bday last week  (No, she isn't a lezzy, just love the crowd and atmosphere at gay bars)\n\nWhat I love about going to gay bars is the drinks are CHEAP and STRONG and Badlands is  one of them. I purchased a vodka and monster drink and a vodka cranberry and only paid $10! What I also like about Badlands is they play good music! Towards the end, though, they were playing all Mariah, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears and Madonna all night, back to back. Gay guys love high maintenance bitches!\n\nWhat I don't like about Badlands is it's hot as hell. You can't quickly go outside the bar for fresh air because it's so damn crowded, so you just end up peeling layers of your clothing, like what most people do. Don't be alarmed when the guy next to you is shirtless here...it's normal to dance practically naked here. You also see a lot of PDA's here, so if you're a prude, this place isn't for you. Lastly, they have a cover charge. Granted it's only $2-3, but it's still a cover charge and I HATE paying to go in to any places!

There are displays, and silver walls and disco lights, the works. It's way too small for the amount of people they let in. It is also a bit awkwardly designed, it feels like a labyrinth to get to the dance floor when drunk...even though it's an uber small space...\n\nAmbiance: This is why it gets another point deduction. If you want to hang out with tweaking, thieving, 19 year old tourists, this is the place to go. Sometimes, when I'm hear, I feel like people are drone zombies.\n\nService: This place has a long standing history of racial profiling and discriminatory practices against people of color. It was published in the papers a few years back that the owner would ask the bouncers to prevent as many latino and black people from entering as possible. And while they have supposedly \"ameliorated\" the situation, it's the same owner and I refuse to a be a patron to someone who at some point held that perspective.\n\nFood/Drink: They actually make pretty ok drinks and they're cheap.

In this case, by \"pretty\" I mean \"desperate.\"\n\nI think if I were the type of boy who liked to go cruising and pick up tricks at the club, this would probably be my spot. It's definitely the youngest crowd I've experienced in castro and houses a fair amount of attractive boys (albeit less attractive than they think they are), but the music is shitty, the drinks are okay, and it's usually so packed that you can't move, talk to your friends, or play solitaire on your blackberry.

Not to mention the bombass Madonna (dancing to Holiday on Labor Day was the best part), Mary J, Whitney and other beats playing that get people to the floor?\n\nWe were in our own worlds on the dance floor (and the only two women) but never did we feel like we'd have to fear some homie coming and starting to grind from behind nor a lack of eye candy who could really da-da-dance.  My friend recognized a man with glowsticks and conga looking glowers in his own world (that she had seen two years ago), so we were shameless and stared at his own state of being so lost (or is it found?) in himself.  Granted we had peeps making out in front of us, but hey, it's love and it's all good.

It lives up to the name Badlands in that it's not very good??! The music is very repetitive. There rarely is an active DJ, most likely its just someone or more precisely anyone, who is playing the exact same songs in the same order. And for whatever reason many of the songs are from 2011 or 2012. If you go there often enough you just know by memory what song is going to play next. The bar attracts some diversity but is mostly filled with the exact same people night after night. Often times in the exact same places too! There's nothing wrong with that but just be prepared. The dance floor opens around 7 but everyone crowds in the front rooms until about 9:30 or 10. It looks very busy but, its not. Its just a lot of people, who are all the same people from the previous night mind you, in a small space since the place is really not that big. Meanwhile, the dance floor and back bar area are virtually empty aside from just a few people willing to dance.\n\nAnother bad thing about Badlands is that it looks very outdated to me and the lack of cleanliness in the restrooms. The one large mens restroom has sewer problems or something and occasionally smells horrible. Inside and out in the club since they always have the doors left wide open. Also I dislike that they do not ventilate the club or have air conditioning. All they use are 3 or 4 fans around the dance floor. And they look like they have not been cleaned in years when you look closely at them. And that coat check room or closet is ridiculous looking. And I should mention that the entire layout of the club is not very good. There is a lot of wasted space. \n\nI also recall seeing they still had holiday wreaths hanging up in February of this past year. That, along with the other things I mentioned, says to me that the owner or the manager or whoever does not really care about any of this. They probably think people are just always lined up and are willing to pay to go there anyway, so it doesn't matter. I really don't know why people go there. Let alone why someone would wait in line and then pay to go there is just beyond me. Its not worth it. But, that being said, if you are a visitor to the city or have never been to gay dance bar in your life, then you might like it.", "author": "L. A."}

It was like going to a girly sleep over with a bunch of tranny and slutty gay men. It was fantastic. Madonna, Britney, Lady Gaga, Cyndi Lauper, etc. I read a review below that you can dance like no one's watching at Badlands and it's true. Just move and sing your heart out.\n\nUnfortunately, our time at Badlands had to come to an early end. Some creepy guy in the corner had the rape twinkle in his eye and his eye happened to be on my straight male friend. Creeper finally stepped over to our group, pulled him aside and offered him a drink. My friend politely declined. Unfortunately drunk creeps don't understand the words \"no thanks\" and he started yelling absurd rape threats. \"If you don't sit down and have a beer with me, my friend over there and I are going to hold you down and rape you\".\n\nFinally I came over to intervene. Creeper did not like that.  He called me every name in the book... spiting and slobering all over us while doing so. In the end, drunk creeper won.

While each bar in The Castro has its own niche, Badlands seems to cater to it all as the sole venue in the area for anyone looking to dance to your typical gay-scene mash-ups with a mixture of all types of music from all decades set to a pulsing bass line.\n\nWhat makes it all the more entertaining is the stiff drinks, hot and trashy boys and the cute bar staff. I love Ian, but he only works weekends so I don't get to see his lovely face as often as I might like to because this place gets packed Thurs-Sat and can sometimes be too overwhelming to deal with all of the self-important Castro Queens. Wow, hey run-on sentence! Anyway, I digress...\n\nBadlands is a great place to come with friends, although I've never had the courage to fly in without a wingman. There is a semi-sectioned off room to the left that always seems seedy and extremely cruisey to me (gays, you know what I mean). It is however a good spot to people watch and take a break from dancing when the occasional bad song comes on.\n\nThere isn't usually a cover and I think the most I have ever seen (during special days like Pink Party or Castro Street Fair) is about $5, but normally just $2 on the weekends. Also, it's $2 per item checked, and although most people hang their coats on the railings of the dance floor I've never felt super secure about that - so you can be your own judge.\n\nOverall, I would say I hit up Badlands at least twice a week (even during finals) and can't seem to muster up one terrible memory!

For a while my typical night out would involve an early start at Bar, followed by some dancing/drinking at Badlands, followed by some pigging out at a local diner or pizza parlor... I have very mixed feelings about the place... I used to like it quite a bit, in part because of the preppy/clean-cut crowd (by SF standards) and dance floor, but it either deteriorated or I got tired of it. Granted, the dancing can be fun, but the dance floor often gets way too crowded for it to be really enjoyable, and the music can be hit or miss (top 40 hits usually, with music videos played on TV screens around the dance floor: after a few songs, Christina, Britney and Jennifer get a little tiresome...). The drinks aren't bad and are pretty cheap I suppose (but there's also a small cover to get in).  \n\nFor a while there was a campaign to boycott the place because of its racist/sexist door policy, by which girls and non-white guys were given a hard time at the door... I'm not sure how it all got resolved, but I think the owner realized that that was not cool and I believe anyone gets in easily now. \n\nLet me close the review by recalling a few memorable experiences...\n\n- I once got crushed under a 300lb girl I was dancing with, when she accidentally fell over me (or did I fall over her and crush her?... I can't remember... but a fall occurred and someone got crushed... fun times...)\n- Some guy once threatened to hit me in the head if I didn't stop flirting with his boyfriend (ok... guilty as charged, though I didn't know they were together... but seriously, threatening someone at a gay bar is so ghetto!)\n- I once walked onto two guys having oral sex in the bathroom, and not even in a stall... and if you've seen the bathroom at Badlands, you know that there's not room to hide: they had to be doing it for everyone to watch... gross, and ghetto!\n\nUPDATE (07/01/07): I went back on a Sunday night and had a great time. The place is not nearly as crowded on Sundays (though still quite happening), and there is no cover. Cheap (but somewhat crappy) drink specials too: $4.50 cosmo... I had a good time, so I feel like I need to bump it 1 star up.", "author": "David S."}

Badlands itself is a great place for drinking and dancing, and I've always known the staff to be professional and friendly.

I can usually avoid (or enjoy, depending on how drunk I am) the rampant crotch grabbing and sweaty bodies enough to partake in some ass-shaking of my own. \n\nSo as much as I'd like to slam Badlands for the large number of obnoxious men that crowd it on a nightly basis, I really can't blame it for drawing a crowd.  Also, I'm just as obnoxious as any of them, so fuck it.  I've danced to Prince, M.I.A., the Scissor Sisters, Kylie Minogue, and countless other awesome dance floor gems here.

Where's the keg? And thus... a lush was born. \n\nAnd when a lush finds herself in the Castro already having eaten lunch and post-lunch coffee, what else is left but to booze it up?

It's Badlands' version of VIP, I guess.\n\nOther than Lime, the bartenders at Badlands are the nicest and most liberal when it comes to cocktail mixing. The majority of them are easy on the eyes without the arrogance (unlike the overly made-up Ken dolls you find at Jet).\n\nI enjoy having the many video screens around me on the (quite possibly largest in Castro) dancefloor, as it adds to the element of being on display.

Yes, during the week, Sadlands is barely tolerable at best.  During the weekend, its lame, filled to the brim with Castro Clones (40+ in Aberzombie) and a bevy of the newly baptized.\n\nSo in light of this, you have to give happy hour 4 stars, and the rest of the time 1 star, bringing the place's overall rating to 2.5, but I'd like to err on the side of lameness, ergo 2 stars.\n\nBut, let's fully describe your Sadlands experience.\n\nPicture it: A bar, with pancrete walls on the outside, and an awning announcing the fact that you have arrived at the center of an obnoxious universe.  The windows are plastered with 8.5 x 11 signs advertising the bars drink specials, much akin to a wall in a Chinese food restaurant.  And the amount of glue applied to this effervescent scattering of flyers has rendered the windows looking as if they've been attacked by fat renderings from a slab of bacon.\n\nIf you make it past the powertripping doormen (\"You can drop the attitude, you only work at a shop you know\"--Edina Monsoon) you'll arrive in early 90's stainless steel bizarreness.  The walls are dark gray with that kind of stairway steel stuff drilled on.  The layout itself is strange as well.  During Happy Hour, they keep the patrons corralled in the front of the bar.\n\nThis brings us to the bar staff.  I think the real reason the back is closed during happy hour is that the staff is unable to handle multiple requests for cocktails (I mean, come on!  How hard could it possibly be?  We're not dealing with minutae of million dollar deals--it was 3 cosmos, one Bailey's and a Widmer!).  \n\nNot only does the staff move like snails in a race, but they're rude--to a point.

The dance floor is completely laughable but I give them props for actually having one (i.e the bar on Castro) but when it is full, there is absolutely no point in going in there cause you're just walking into an instant paralysis moment.\n\nThe good thing about this place is that it plays top 40 and I love that the staff is cute and on most occasions, pretty helpful too...they've found my lost wallet at least twice, and they work pretty hard (Something I noticed when I was struggling to move on a Saturday night), I also seem to get hit on the most here...I love that.

Some of the negative reviews read like they went to church and got a wafer made out of feces instead of their communion. Lighten up, people... it's a BAR. Like so much of the Castro, you take the good with the bad, and unless you're planning to open a bar yourself, you settle for what gives you that medicine in a relatively fun and tasty package. For my Friday 2-for-1 happy hour fix, this place is still the Castro ticket.\n\nIt's good for cheap drinks, cheap peeps, and uninspired, catchy music. It's the Cafe when you're too old to go to the Cafe. The crowd can definitely get bitchy and rude, and the music can definitely get, well, \"formulaic\" is the nicest word I can really come up with. (But then again, sometimes I don't really want my bar music to \"challenge\" me.)And, the place has some of the nicest staff around (Gabe, Ian, Francis and Charlie leap to mind)... and some of the bitchiest too (I'll leave that one alone). \n\nWhile I know having a favorite Castro bar is like preaching religion for many of us, c'mon, let's give em a little bit of a break here.

As much as I love 80's music, you can't really dance to it.\n\nThe bar: It's also inconsistant, sometimes I'll get a really good bartender and sometimes I'll get a really bad one.  One time we ordered 3 drinks and my friend paid but all he had was enough money for $1 tip.  The bartender then proceeded to comment on it as she said to my friend \"Great thanks you're such a baller *thumbs up*\"  I threw her a couple of other dollars to shut her up but still she could have kept the comments to herself.  The drinks are not too bad though.\n\nThe dance floor: WAAAYYY too small and crowded.  This place was designed really poorly.  2/3 of the place is all standing area and 1/3 is the dance floor, constructed into a weird \"swimming pool\" circle with basically barriers around it and there is a limited amount of ways into and off the dance floor.  ALSO I REALLY hate it when people are just standing around.  If you want to stand around, stand in the standing area, not on the dance floor, you're taking up too much precious room.\n\nThe People: Its also a mixed bag, sometimes I see the weirded tweekers here.  One guy was just dancing by himself with a whistle in his mouth and looked like he was on speed or something.  And since everyone is trying to cram into the dance floor, people are not very mindful of others (especially when drunk) and just seem to charge around everywhere.\n\nOverall, Badlands is not my first choice of places to go to.  I've been to the Sacramento location and was shocked to see how different their badlands is than ours.  I had a much more better experience at the Sac location.\n\nThe cover is not too expensive so its def a plus.

I am going to write a review just to make the average go up. \n\nFirst of all, you should follow the rules of going out before you go to this bar, just like any other bar. \n\n1- Don't go out on weekends. Just don't. You will run into a lot of stupid bridge and tunnel folk who think drinking until they puke is a great time. Plus, it is over crowded and you can't have a good time if your not able to move your arms away from your body. \n\n2- Happy Hour is the best hour. 2-for-1! I mean, come on. That is the best deal in the whole city. You get to order a mixed drink (not just well crap) and you get the second one for free. I haven't found a happy hour that is better. \n\n3- If there is a cover, Don't go in. That is for any club. I am not about covers. Even though BL has a cover, it is only one certain nights. And you don't want to be in the club those nights because everyone else is in there being over charged for drinks. So just wait until a day when there isn't a cover and meet a nice local guy who has his life together. Not some 20 something, just out of college trying to cope with the real world. \n\n4- Go to your local bar. I lived in the neighborhood and worked down the street from BL so this was my local bar. Once you get to know the bartenders, and the regulars then you get that feeling like on the show \"Cheers\" when you walk in and every one yells out, \"Norm.\"\n\nOh, and beware of those stupid boys who always complain about how superficial and young the boys are in the Castro. These people are the biggest hypocrite because even thought they give that whole spill about \"Castro is hell\" they go to it almost every night. \n\nBLs is a great place. I like it.

All gorgeous, friendly and amazing in their own way!!\n\n...there are plenty of urinals bit only 2 toilets which is a bad point!

But for a newbie from out of town for a week, I thought it was a fun bar where I met some pretty interesting people.\n\nThe drinks were good, the music was great, and the people were nice. It was a bit overcrowded for me whereas there was no real place to escape people. I'm used to crowded clubs, but I'm also used to having hiding spots that provide a little comfort from the burden of a sardine can. The bathroom situation seemed odd too....maybe I was confused, but I only saw one bathroom with one toilet and one urinal? Seemed a little strange.\n\nOverall, I had a great time and I'm glad I went. But now that I've read all these Yelp reviews, I look forward to trying out different/better places when I visit SF again!", "author": "Jeffrey H."}

I wanted to make his visit really fun, and of course, for an out of the closet Texan, a visit to the Castro is de rigueur. My friend and I used to go clubbing every weekend back in the day, and I asked for recommendations for a fun dance club.  Everyone said \"Badlands, duh.\"\n\nDuh is right, this place was a blast.  First off, the doorperson was very friendly.  Then we go in and it's two for one drinks, and the drinks were not horribly watered down (but this may have something to do with the fact that I am a former waitress and thus awesome tipper).  I told the bartender my best friend from h.s. was visiting and was there any possible way the DJ would be willing to play the song we used to dance to every weekend back in the day (not saying the song's name as it will date me and a lady never tells her age!).  The bartender was really nice and said the DJ normally does not take requests but if I write it down and leave a tip he would see what he could do.  So I did and lo and behold, about 45 minutes later, the song was played.  So awesome, it was like I was instantly 16 again!  Then, get this, half an hour later, the bartender tracked me down on the dance floor to check and see if the DJ had played my song. WOW.\n\nThe music was perfect dance music: Gaga, Britney, Madonna, etc.  We had so much fun, I can't wait til he comes to visit again because we will definitely go back.\n\nSo to sum up: extremely friendly staff, fellow club goers were very friendly, and having a coat-check was really helpful, just an all around great experience.\n\nOh and on our way out, we passed the DJ booth where a sign prominently read something along the lines of \"don't even think of requesting a song.\"  Which makes their willingness to play our song even nicer.  Really appreciated it.", "author": "Jamie C."}

They got rid of the two pool tables and the 4 pinball machines, and replaced the backwoods, license plates all-over-the-wall theme with a modern (small) dance club, sporting several LCD monitors.  VJ plays tunes for the patrons.  This is not a good bar for friends to get together to chat, because it gets very loud and crowded, but it is a fun place to drink and dance.\n\nBadlands has a very popular Sunday afternoon, they have $2 beers and 2 for one cocktails (all drinks, not just well drinks).  Badlands has a fun upbeat atmosphere and gets very busy on weekends.\n\nThe negative:  Wear your rain slicker on busy night!  All along the ceiling (just above the seating against walls) they have these large ventilation ducts.  When the place gets busy, (and it does) because they don't have very good ventilation, the condensation produced by all of the breath and sweat of the patrons gathers on the duct and drips continually onto whomever is sitting underneath.  It's really nasty.  I'm very surprised they haven't done anything to fix the problem.  It's pretty much continuous, so once you're tired of it, you get up and stand.", "author": "Mike R."}

I love the 2-for-1 drink specials they have until 8:30.  Normally my friend and I will chill there until they start doing the stamps (9 or 9:30) and then head off to some of the other bars where there is no cover.  I'm not overly fond of the music, but sometimes they do play some of my favorites (something you'd hear on XM 81 BPM).  I have noticed that the place is less crowded on Fridays; from what I gather, a lot of the Asian guys go to Dragon after the 2-for-1 drink special ends.  On Saturdays, the place is completely packed.  I don't go there to dance, and I wouldn't recommend you do either unless you can do so feeling like your packed in a sardine can.\n\nI just recently went here for New Year's and the place was packed.  The line out the door was literally all the way up to Edge.  I had a good time, but like I said it was extremely packed.  The bartenders are generally great and a couple of them remember my usual drink.\n\nI think the place really is touch-and-go, and that you really won't be able to tell if you like it or not unless you go yourself.  Just try to get in early so you don't have to pay the cover (which normally is only $2-$3).", "author": "Brent A."}

We went in costume on Halloween for the happy hour portion of the night and the most popular costume in the Castro was SWAT Team gear and traveling in giant militias via Muni bus! That still didn't deter us even though we felt like we were heading into Iraq.\n\nInside we met a young lost boy who instantly wanted to let me know he's not gay, he's just new here in town and feels comfortable there and he doesn't know many people. Yeah yeah whatever.... save it! He seemed entranced with our costumes and since he clinged to my gay friend like a lost puppy needing a father figure, I pawned him off .  We later found out he was a former ice head and was in the military so that explained a lot. \n\nGoing to the bathroom was like going into battle. In the dark bar I could pass for a guy in drag or a maybe a really good post surgery tranny but in the bathroom lights, it's clear that I never had and never will have a penis.\n\nI go into the unisex bathroom and see someone pissing at the urinal and it's the guy with bare ass chaps we were admiring earlier at the bar. He turns around and just kinda smiles and heads out. There is someone in the stall and I notice his little eyeball looking at me through the crack so I look away. I look over again, see his eyeball and look away. Totally Seinfeld experience. I realize hes not coming out, hes standing, and there is no piss sound so he's probably in there with someone else and the sight of a girl is the last thing he wants to see.\n\nI leave and go to the second unisex bathroom and this guy kinda rushes in front of me in the hallway and gets into the single stall before me. Once again I have to watch another guy use the urinal and look at me like I's an alien and as I'm waiting I realize this guy in the stall is taking forever too. He finally emerges with this ashamed look on his face and the whole bathroom fills with the stench of the gigantic DUMP he took right before I have to go in and take a wee.  Thanks buddy!\n\nThe dance floor was fun to watch and I met some cool people and we had some great laughs. The drinks were pretty stiff too, which is always a plus.

Yes there are questionable activities going on with some of the patrons in this bar, yes the music can become mind numbing, yes it gets crowded and hot, and YES some of the bartenders are green behind the gills.  However, I would say that everyone has to try Badlands at least once to form their own opinion, and this is mine.\n\nHitting the Castro without hitting Badlands is like watching the God Father parts 1 and 3 without watching 2.  Typically I'll begin or end end my nights here and I always have a blast.  It can become a little overcrowded, and forget about dancing on the floor when the \"flavor of the week\" song starts spinning.\n\nUpon entering Badlands you will find two table tops to your right with accompanying stools.  The bar takes up the entire west wall and extends through both rooms.  Off to your left, you'll find an area with two table tops at which you can stand at and benches for you to sit (although the occasional drunk girl will be dancing upon them).  Here too you will find an ATM.  There are three restrooms, one containing nothing but urinals and the other two are of mixed use.  At the entrance of the lower mixed use restroom is where you'll find the coat check.  The dance floor is often packed and at times can become very hot.  Not to worry, just use the guys shirt next to you as a rag.  :OP\n\nA little tid bit of information...Badlands was not the first video bar on the west coast.  Apparently The Midnight Sun was.  And if you take a gander upwards in the restroom where the urinals are, you'll find the ceiling covered in license plates as this was the decor of the entire bar in Badlands past.\n\nOverall, I always have a great time here.  The bartenders are wonderful (especially Charlie at the very front Thursdays through Sundays) and the music tends to get me to tap my feet.

My mom even liked it.\n\n3) The drinks are decent...or amazing if you get Charlie..who totally is the sweetest bartender ever.\n\nHowever...it has its flaws. The place is packed like drag queens at a free wig giveaway on any 'on' night....and the music is either really awesome or strange and lackluster...depending on when you hit it. Also, standing in a hideous line to get in while its freezing cold outside really sucks..but this could happen anywhere.\n\nMy suggestion is to go on an 'off' night (Thursday and Sunday are my favorites) and party like a rockstar with your closest pals. Badlands is my Castro staple when I want to go frolic and remember that I like boys, for sure.\n\nIts a cute place to take gay bar virgins, too. I've popped many a marycherry with it.

You can't beat the 2 for 1 drinks that last till 8pm.  It is a place where you could cruise alone or hang out with your friends.  \n\nClients ages range from mid/late 20s to early 50's.  Mostly Caucasian (60 - 70%),  Asians (20 - 25%) , Latinos (5 - 10%), African American (less than 2%) and there are always straight ladies who like to hang out with their darling gay friends.\n \nThere are plenty of video screens throughout the bar playing music video to keep you occupied if you were alone.  It could get very crowded during HH on Fridays but it gets worse on Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nThe line to get in starts around 10pm on Fri and Sat and it gets longer after 11pm.  It could take up to 20 - 30mins to get in if arrived late.  I usually avoid to go there on both nights because it is jam packed inside and indeed the dance floor is too small for the dancing crowd.\n\nBut if you wanted to go to somewhere that is cruisy and want to find a trick, you do have a good chance there.   As the night goes on, lonely people want to pair up and leave to do their things.  Of course, a lot of them already drunk so they are not as picky. \n\nThis rules always applied to gay bars everywhere :-)\n\nHave fun!", "author": "SFGAM d."}

I also know this place has gotten a lot of crap in the past for racism issues, etc. Just thought I'd get that out there before praising it.\n\nBadlands, though it can be overwhelmingly crowded at times, is the highlight of my weekend evening trips to the Castro. The mood is a great hybrid of celebratory and slightly belligerent. This is probably because the crowd is primarily a bunch of fresh hotties under 35. I'd say on average there is about 1 fag hag to 8 gay men. \n\nThe dance floor is intimate but roomy, music selection is phenomenal, almost everyone is friendly. If you know someone who works there (which is really easy to come by, considering so many employees love to befriend customers) you can get their \"special\" drinks. (Hint: Cheap) They also have \"special\" nights. Check them out. \n\nI know it's gotten a lot of crap for being a meatmarket and loud and obnoxious, but if that's what you're looking for, it's the best place to go.

If you do end up dancing with a gay guy, he will be dancing with you doggy style, so they don't have to see your face or chest to remind them that, oh right, she's a girl.  So the music they play is a lot of pop, European pop mostly, like Kylie Minogue or Mel C from the Spice girls.  They have daily drink specials, and the bartenders are super sweet.  Very attentive and over heard me mentioning the special, and boom, made it for me hella quick.  A lot of guys sit around in the front to just chat.  And that was where I got yelled at by one of my people telling me that I dress like a nun and he needs to buy me some Versace.  Nice, I think, haha.

I have been to Badlands a few times in the past year and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  I have noticed a considerable improvement to this club from the staff to the drinks.  Also, I see a more diverse crowd attending now.  One of the things I have really grown to love is the Happy Hour two for one special.  Granted this could get you in trouble the next day when you wake up for work.  Overall, my perceptions of the club have changed dramatically and I see myself going back there more and more.\n\nBad Bad Bad News for this twink image driven club in the heart of the Castro.  This club could be shut down and I would not lose any sleep over it.  The staff are selectuvely hired because they have the perfect bodies.  You are not taken seriously at this club unless YOU have a perfect body layered with muscles, blue eyes and blonde hair.  Or as the owner once put it, \"there is a club in the mission for  'those kind of people'.  \n\nAside from that the club is way over crowded, the drinks are weak and the dance floor is too small.  Overall it is a club that is extremely difficult to enjoy yourself unless you are considered the stereo typical perfect man.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

While I have had fun at The Q, Toad Hall, and Trigger maybe one night, Badlands is consistent.  The videos make it more interesting than other bars along with the poppy music that is played.  Bartenders are the nicest around and can always be counted on to create a strong concoction that does the trick.  The downsides of this bar are the older creepy men who don't have a problem being \"touchy\" which goes on at every gay bar, and the crowds.  I do not recommend going there on Friday or Saturday night as it is impossible to move or get anything accomplished not to mention the cover charge.  Best nights to go are Sunday and Wednesday, but really any week night is a blast.", "author": "John H."}

We were just getting our groove on when two gay guys walk up to us and point at me.  \"You are hot...but he (the bf) is REALLY hot\" and he proceeds to start petting him on the head!  I felt the urge to lash out at this guy in the bf's arm so I pulled him closer, saying coyly \"no, you're hot and he's hot\".  The petter said, \"no, he's old and has to wear diapers\".

When it all comes down to it the people here know how to dance and drink like there is no fucking tomorrow! The bartenders love me cause my stage name or at least one of them is Hot Chocolate and since the women that flee straight bars flock to this place because of the jock factor they have no idea that my black ass is there for the same reason. I just love dancing all night and my LBGT friends act as my body guards to make sure that I don't end up on milk carton since big daddies and bears love me and try to creep my way on the dance floor like Patrick Swayze to baby in Dirty Dancing when they're in the water, but I am not the one honey let me tell you. Hey what can I say this place is the shit and it all hits the fan when ever I start kissing some gal on the dance floor but hey what can I say Iet women make the first move cause I'm a gentleman. I'm there to dance the night away. I get hugs all day at the Dyke march supporting my home skillettes cause I have that little brother appeal. I'm also the only straight guy in my house of five and have two Moms that I love that own the place I live in and love me like a son, who got married at Dolores park. Which makes yours truly an honorary lesbian by default in a mans body. Hetro clubs are boring cause nobody dances anymore. You haven't lived until you've danced at Badlands all night and look like you don't wanna hook up with anyone. Any straight male in his right mind with any sense of style would be up in there getting his groove on since music and good times with good friends is for everyone. My six sisters and mom would be proud and jealous of my good taste in places to dance as this one is at the top of my list. Sexual orientation and discrimination is a concept for knuckle draggers so if this doesn't resonate well with the culturally inept, tuff titties I'm not there for you I'm there to enjoy my life how ever I please.

That having been said, the music is a mixed bag. One night it was awful teenage female teenyboppers one after another: hilary, ashlee, lindsay, xtina, britney, then a britney megamix. I wanted to vomit and seriously beat someone upside the head. Otherwise, I've never had any problems getting in, and have had no discrimination problems at Badlands. Better music than the Cafe, and at least the videos give you something to watch if you're trying to avoid eye contact! :)", "author": "Hao L."}

Others tend to make rather weak drinks, it seems, because they're afraid of being fired summarily. Almost all of them, are very, very nice and have interesting, multidimensional personalities. Almost all treat me very, very nicely in a totally genuine way. In fact, on average, they are way nicer than the staff of many of the local bars- and not just to customers they know. \n\nAs many note, yes, the music is a bit inconsistent, but I'd maintain that this keeps things a bit more interesting. Yes, some artists and titles get overplayed but, hey, Badlands has plenty of 20-something gay men who, when they go home, are going to play the same Madonna titles over and over and over again (like my roomie) and this appeals to them. \nI prefer Badlands on the less crowded nights (i.e., anything but Friday and Saturday) since it does get way too crowded for my taste. On Friday and Sat nights, people tend to get sloppy/drunk and way too rude- often knocking into others without apology. Also, groups, in an attempt to wend their way through the crowd will often hold hands in sequence and force their way through the crowd. Bottom line, on these nights, I wind up wearing my own or someone else's drink way too often. \nSometimes, too, there seem to be too many \"outsiders\" - for example, cadres of very loud, straight women or groups of \"not-fully-comfortable\" straight people. Like many SF venues, the space is not large enough to accommodate too much of this without significant impact. \nTherefore, I tend to enjoy the other nights- particularly Thursdays and Sundays. \nSome criticise the layout of the bar but, short of building up or out, there's not much that could be done better. I even like the fact that many of the well-placed video displays are the retro CRT types. \nAh, and last- but not least- the barbacks and doormen. Like the bartenders, they're totally sweet upstanding (and hard working) guys. \n\nOh yes, one more thing, kudos to Badlands for banning a well-known troublemaker who was always causing strife with others.\n\nGotta add this- at times I'm not too comfortable with the apparent owner.  He seems to have the staff totally under his thumb- often capriciously so.  Also, I'm not sure why, on at least two occasions, he's made a point of buying drinks for everone around but me.  The last time was when there were just two customers in the bar!  Very embarrasing.\n\nAnd so, I guess I'll conclude two things.  Firstly, I should probably get out and about more.  Secondly, San Francisco should be able to do better.\n\nGuys- make a visit to Chicago!  Check out Side Track, Roscoe's, FireFly, The Closet, Jackhammer, etc...", "author": "Anthony G."}

Badlands. now look it up in the dictionary. bad-lands. hence why its bad music, bad drinks, bad homos, a place for a bad bad night. i dont reccomend comming. though its understandable if i see u there since its probably ur friends who made u go. the only reason this place is so packed is because of the S-E-X which sells. hang around after 2 when it closes for the sidewalk sale. self explanatory.", "author": "Derrick n."}
