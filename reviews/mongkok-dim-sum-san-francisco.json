My go-to is actually the box of black bean spareribs over rice, as it comes with heapfuls of cabbage if you're here early enough (they may run out of that delicious cabbage if you show up too late). I always get it with soy sauce. It's filling and costs only $5.50 (with tax). You can also get a box of chicken feet for $5.50. Sure the spareribs and the chicken feet are fatty but that's my preference.\n\nThe dumplings are nice and glutinous although quite salty/full of MSG. I tend to prefer the cheung fan over the dumplings and also the lo mai gai (comes in small and large).\n\nNot that this really factors into my ratings, but the people who work here are always quite pleasant!

Or kaka. Or poopoo... you get the idea.\n\nI don't have a very distinguished palate when it comes to dimsum; I can usually only tell whether it's \"good\" or \"bad\"; \"oily\" or \"not oily\"; \"flavorful\" or \"plain\" and so forth. Most of these dim sum bakery types that I've been to in the Richmond/Sunset area have actually been pretty damn good, except for the fact that they all seem to make one critical mistake: the dimsum is never hot because the bakeries always leave their freaking doors open when it's freezing out.\n\nHere's a few scenarios to illustrate my point.\n\n1. I eat in at a bakery-type dimsum place with a few friends, but I'm always first in line because I speak some sort of Chinese. I wait patiently while my friends grab their food and join me at the table, but by the time they sit down, my dimsum is already cold.\n\n2. I eat in at a bakery-type dimsum place with a few friends, and I'm first in line again. This time I sit down with my food on the table, and start scarfing them mofos down while they're still hot. My friends eventually get to the table and see that I'm already half done, bitch at me for being a douche and not waiting to eat together, and then my food turns cold while I'm being bitched at.\n\n3. Learning from my past lessons, I tell my friends that we should this time get the food to go and eat at a friend's house. We bring the food back to his place after about 10-15 mins, the food is already cold.\nAddendum: we nuke our cold siu mai in the microwave, but they don't taste the same as they do when they're comng out piping hot from the steamers.\n\nLong story short, the dim sum here is pretty standard and they have all the usual offerings, (except coffee. i didn't see them sell coffee here.) including paigu by the bucket, but the food is ruined due to a poorly-thought out marketing technique which invites more customers but ruins the integrity of the food.

Unfortunately I wish I hadn't gotten it & just gone another ? years missing it.  The Chinese doughnut was cold & bitter which made me suspect it was spoiled.  It was very disappointing.

I stopped by Mongkok for some har gow, spareribs in black bean sauce over rice, and congee.  The total was $7.90 and I had enough food for two meals.  They're generous, and the dumplings are larger than average, so even though the prices seem average, it's actually a good deal.  Dumplings are 3 for $1.60.\n\n* Har gow - Decent, a little salty.  They use big shrimp.  \n* Congee - They only have one kind and one size (huge).  It's pork with preserved egg.  There isn't much egg or pork.  Bland.  They don't add scallions.  You can buy a fried donut though.  Good Luck Dim Sum still has the best congee for a dim sum take out place in SF.\n* Pork spareribs over rice - I thought that the sparerib flavor and juice would have seeped into the long grain rice but that didn't happen. The rice was mushy and oversteamed.  They added boiled cabbage and drizzled the rice with soy sauce.  The ribs were good, a little fatty but that's to be expected.  Overall, it was just okay. \n\nThe menu is in Chinese, so you either have to point to what you want or know what it's called.  They have a massive inventory of items - dumplings, lots of man tou (steamed buns), rice noodles with different fillings, Chinese tamales, egg rolls, sesame balls, baked sausage buns, grass jelly, turnip (or it could be taro) cake, egg custard tarts (including a white kind), chicken feet, sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf and more.

The baked hot dog was nothing special and I feel like there was too much bread and not enough meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-30", "description": "There are several options one can partake in with regards to Cantonese style dim sum. \n\nFirst, there's the fancy sit down restaurant where you get charged per person for a pot of tea (with complementary hot water refills), with or without the push cart experience by naggy pushy at times clueless older ladies at some places (which make you wonder if some of them work on commi$$ion in addition to the child labor hourly rate$ they are getting from the A$IAN Cheapne$$ restaurant owner$). Depending on the location, quality, and prestige of this type of restaurant, this will be the more pricer option.\n\nThe second one is of course the el cheapo nitty gritty frozen and microwaveable variety, available at your finest Asian supermarket (Amoy and Doll brands come to mind with a myriad of other selections only for the bold & the brave). Great for post Asian clubbing munchie stoners (that is if you're not too stoned to operate a microwave). This one is I suppose the only \"24 hour\" solution (unlike in Taipei where there ARE 24 hour dim sum restaurants, none of them I hear are any good or authentic, but available nonetheless and better than the frozen crap we have).\n\nThe third one is somewhere in between, and for SF city proper, that is the smaller Chinatown like shops that make and steam/fry/bake/cook their own dim sum in house and sell them to-go only. It's not restaurant quality, but sure beats being a stoner munchie or a munchie stoner resorting to TV dinner style snacking. Luckily you can find these kinds of shops in the Richmond and of course scattered places across the Sunset.\n\nAnd Mongkok Dim Sum on Noriega, at least based on my last take-out experience with them years ago, has proven to be a reliable and very affordable means.of dimming the sum.\n\nMy memory is mostly failing on me, but I've stuck with the basics and the classics from MDS (from shrimp dumplings, shiu mai, chicken feet/phoenix claws, fried daikon cake, chive dumplings, rice noodle rolls with beef, various dim sum desserts etc), and they've come through for me and my stomach a lot more than flakey friends or unreliable family members.\n\nAgain decent, great value, a tad bit unrefined and perhaps a wee bit Americanized, but not uber restaurant pimp class.\n\nCome early well before the lunch crowds and the vicious meter maids hit, coz that double parking fine to run inside MDS buying to go might end up costing as much as a lunch at Koi Palace with crab XLB.\n\nAnd now for the completely useless and unrelated part of the review.\n\nThe name Mongkok derives from an area in Hong Kong, pronounced Wong Gok (used to be called Argyle in English, then reverted back to Mongkok after British rule ended in 97), that very loosely translates to \"very busy and packed point\". It is THE most happening place to be for youngsters, hipsters, and maybe their version of Yelpers & Facebookers. Lots of cool shops for the ladies, guys, ranging from pop culture, fashion, electronic gadgets, running shoes, snacks, desserts, restaurants, CD and media stores, arcade malls that might house some counterfeit bootleg DVD-rs of movies and video games, trinkets and the ilk. \n\nSome areas of Mongkok used to be shall we say, rather rough and tough. The scene of a lot of after hours gang related activity, where competing gangs may occassionally bust out a lead pipe or a knife and do some live man to man butchery. And of course the red light districts (although I'm told many have cleaned up as a result of government crackdowns, but that is still around to some extent or moved to the outer edges) where many a local man roam the grounds in search of love for rent amongst locals, Chinese from China, Russians, SE Asians and whatever exotic breeds float their boats. Part of the crime of course run by the gangs.\n\nSo yes, Mongkok has been fondly referred to as \"Mein Cock\" amongst the luxurious pleasure seekers of the night. And no they are not looking to dim sum, but to dim dong. No wonder Ed M commented with a \"tee hee\" on the name in his review.\n\nexample of usage between two pleasure seeking bromantic comrades:\n\nHong Konger dude #1: \"Hey dude, what shall we do tonight?\"\nHong Konger dude #2: \"How about we go poke some balls?\" (snooker that is)\nHong Konger dude #1: \"My girlfriend is playing mah jong tonight all night. How about we go to Mein Cock!\"\nHong Konger dude #2: \"Awwww yeah baby! Sounds good! Let's do that after poking balls. I'm getting the extra topping of 5 star ice fire BJ treatment!\" (alternating between mouthfuls of hot tea and ice water)\nHong Konger dude #1: \"Yes let's make this a Poking night!

I've actually never had a siu mai from any restaurant that was good, only because they either undercook it, overcook it, or jell it in fat. This place tends to had a lot of fat that comes free with your siu mai. Some love it, I tend not to.\n\nOverall, this place is decent, the prices are decent, and the service is just decent.

I could definitely see issues with this place if you dont speak Cantonese here.  \n\nAlso, a couple years back someone spread a dirty rumor that one of the owners of this place had contracted SARS.  That was funny, since it actually hurt their business until people forgot about it.  Mean though; they must have pissed someone off really bad...", "author": "Jeff H."}

I wasn't disappointed either, it was tasty and super cheap which makes it a winner in my book. It wasn't the best quality dim sum I've ever had, but for the price I'm sold. I also liked the staff and appreciated their humoring my pronunciation.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I have been to many Chinese bakeries in my lifetime, and I know what to expect and not to expect. Things not to expect: great service and decorative atmosphere. What I do expect is for the food items be cheap and delicious. The dim sum items were really good here. The siu mais particularly were really good and are huge. The baos were pretty good too. The amount of money that cost to fill me up here was way less than if I were to go to Micky Ds.", "author": "Hilland C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-11-26", "description": "There are far better and cleaner dim sum places in the city.  This is one of those inexpensive dim sum places where you order at the counter which makes it ok for an impulse quickie dim sum run, but it's ultimately dissatisfying because it's either too greasy or too dried out.  They do, however, have these interesting egg white egg tarts that I haven't found elsewhere.", "author": "Raz R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-10", "description": "This place was recommended to me by a co-worker of mine.  Their foods is in big portions.  They have two sizes of their cha-siu bows.  The large ones are enough for me for a lunch, and they also make small ones, just as stuffed with the meat.  They're not skimpy on that, that's for sure.  All their dim-sum dumplings are great.  Yes, they have HUGE siu mai dumplings.  They more than most dim sum houses have.  What's my favorite is the naw-mei faan.  Which in English is called Glutinous Rice, or simply Sticky Fried Rice.  That too is a couple of meals in itself.  I like it here, and they're not so rude.  I know what I want, I may not be able to say it in Chinese, as my Chinese is very slim to none...But I know what specific things are because I grew up eating my favorites.  And if you're lucky enough you can get front door parking.  Otherwise, you may need to park up the street in the residential areas.  It's worth a check if you like variety.", "author": "Cheryl N."}
