{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-23", "description": "Primavera was a prima facie case of very disappointed bundled in chilaquiles form. Each triangle of corn totopos, holding a TOTOlly sad POSition in the ranks of the honorable Californian chilaquiles - in form, texture and taste.  \n\nThe expectation was here:\n\n(you unfortunately can't see how high the mark is because the Yelp word parameters will not allow it to appear)\n\nThe execution was here:\n\n(you unfortunately can't see a mark because it's miscroscopic and not visible to the naked human eye)\n\n'What happened?' may be the response of the slew of elite 5 star reviews and ultra positive feedback - 'Maybe you tried the stand on a bad day?' 'Did you have a little too much taquila to recall the quile-chile?' Why, no, that would've made it all the more tasty.  I digress... back to the meat and potatoes. Or to the beans and totopos. \n\n(1) Texture - The texture was so off balance, each totopos soggy, with no slight crunch coming through - no strength to endure the mole that was left on it for too long before the handover from pan to table. And the less than ideal texture was a theme that resonated across the plate - the beans tasting as if they were refried beans right out of a can. I yearned for the slight crunch of the chilaquiles against the salsa/mole, and for grandma's stewed beans cooked with the rustic homemade feel.  All of those components were missing. \n\n(2) Flavor - the chilaquiles certainly got me to question the OR in flavOR.  This wasn't the flavor profile I was expecting. It was something else - or nothing. A bland form of salsa/mole. I was missing the expected flavor burst so characteristic of Mexican mole. Where did the CHILE in the CHILEquiles go? The ancho, pasilla, mulato and chipotle? Where was the crushed black pepper, the achiote, cumin, cloves, anise, tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, sesame seeds, and herbs?  Where did the flavor go? \n\n(3) Portion - I get it - there's high rent in SF to account for. But isn't it already accounted for in the extra SF vendor fee that is imposed? In addition to the general issues with texture and taste, I was further disappointed by the amount - or lack of amount - of substance and food delivered. I could count 4 pieces (note, not slices) of square and triangular avocados on my plate. With an amount of totopos less than 10.  Maybe the beans are purposefully mashed to prevent one from noticing the 15-20 beans that would've been on the plate but for the mashing to disguise?\n\n(4) Overall performance and delivery - Bursting with desire to try the chilequiles, and filled with anticipation backed by raving reviews, I waited around 25 minutes in line and another 6-8 minutes thereafter for the chilaquiles to be prepared. 30 plus minutes of my life I will never get back. Please do not make the same mistake as me. Or do, but do so knowing that this is not that SoCal San Diegan variant of chilequiles, but a foreign, neutral variant. \n\nAs a recourse I thought... maybe I should try another dish? Maybe I should try the fish taco that came highly recommended by the Primavera rep? But from the soggy tortilla to the overly battered and oily fish to the totally lacking flavors and salsa, this only reconfirmed my earlier findings. I tried so much to like this place that is highly regarded by many.  But I guess this is one of those times the old adage is true - I would not jump off a bridge if others were to. \n\nPrimavera, Ima so disappointed and vera much wish I could post a more hopeful and positive review.  Please hear my plea to do justice to the noble and delicious chilaquiles dish that brings honor to California and its resident Californians.", "author": "Vivienne K."}

Come instead for amazing Mexican food served by super friendly people (tucked away at the back of the market). Expect a small, rotating menu of tamales, tortillas, chilaquiles, and more.\n\nThe only thing I disagree with other reviewers on is that the chilaquiles are the best thing on the menu; to me, it's the tamales. Easily the best tamales I've had, and worthy of the visit to the Ferry Building on a Saturday.\n\nThe chilaquiles are certainly delicious. How could they not be? They're tortilla chips covered in fresh cotija cheese and salsa, with sides of buttery scrambled eggs and super flavorful beans. And maybe they are the best chilaquiles I've had, and it's just that I don't get the fuss over chilaquiles in general.\n\nThe tamales are served piping hot, and come with the same deliciously flavorful side of beans (and I'm not usually all that into beans) as well as an equally surprisingly delicious side salad with various kinds of pickled veggies. The corn outside was perfectly steamed and comforting. Yum!\n\nAnd what's inside the tamales and tacos seems to be on constant rotation, so always something new to try (I had pork tamales, and saw chicken tamales on the menu on another visit -- the same one when I mistakenly opted not to get the tamales).", "author": "Sravanthi K."}

I'll admit, I was pretty skeptical about their food because their prices are pretty high compared to other Mexican food joints, but they definitely give you your money's worth in portion size and best of all, their food is really good!! \n\nMy first two visits with them had me try their famous Tamales and Chile Relleno respectively. \n\nTamale Plate w/ Butternut Squash & Monterey Cheese and Maurilias Pork. --  http://bit.ly/19SBhnA\nOh man, these tamales!!  So good!  And they frequently change every week so you'll always be bound to try something different.  Both of these were loaded and came with a plate full of extra veggies and beans.  My favorite of the two was definitely the Butternut Squash with Monterey Cheese.  The pic itself doesn't do it justice, but when I cut into the Tamale, I got a nice amount of gooey melted cheese stretching out.  Definitely good stuff and you can't go wrong with ordering this.\n\nChile Relleno en Nogada --  http://bit.ly/KTKvXy\nBeef and pork picadillo relleno with Sourcream walnut sauce and pomegranite\nThere was a lot going on with this plate.  Very creative with the pomegranite seeds as it added some acidity to the richness of the beef and pork filled Relleno.  This isn't regularly on the menu, but if it does appear again, I wouldn't mind ordering this again too.\n\nSo after two visits to Primavera, now I realize what I've been missing out on because I used to always pass by their tent at the Farmers Market but after having their Tamales and Chile Relleno, I can't resist stopping by to take a look at their menu which constantly changes.  Their food is high quality and so far everything I've had has been really good!

I ordered the Tamale Plate ($9.50) consisting of two pork tamales, refried black beans and pickled vegetables. Service at this early hour took no more than two minutes. A small vat of red salsa sits atop the order pick-up table.\n\nHow was it? The entire dish was fantastic. Everything goes well together. However, the salsa was very mild so I hope they entertain the idea of having mild and hot salsas in the future. \n\nTips/Thoughts:\n\n-There is limited table seating in this area of the Ferry Building.

The sauce was ok. The main positive was that the chips were PERFECT chilaquiles chips. They were crunchy enough to hold up to being drowned in sauce. The huge chunks of avocado was a nice addition. The eggs really kind of got me down though. I'm not an expert in the chilaquiles field, but my local spot serves their eggs over easy and there is something magnificent to breaking the yolk on the chips. The taste is outstanding. And this is now my preference. The scrambled eggs Primavera dished up were disappointing.

Since Jamie W. and I had an hour before the book signing, we waited in line at the Primavera stand for one of their fabled Mexican breakfasts. There were four desirable selections on the framed menu, and I went with the $9.50 Chilaquiles \"El Cardenal\", which was a paper plate of chilaquiles with tomato and chipotle in adobe sauce accompanied by scrambled eggs, onions, crema, and refried beans (see photo). \n\nIt was a tad pricey for what you get, but the combination of flavors burst in my mouth with every bite, especially the spicy kick of the chipotle.

I have Yelp to thank for even beginning to be able to find it.  And for enlightening me to the existence of the Embarcadero farmers' market in the first place.  I am a thankful tourist - thankful that I didn't end up at Fisherman's Wharf being sorry I ate at one of the crappy seafood restaurants, toured Alcatraz for $25, and/or stuffed my face with Ghirardelli chocolate whilst touring Ripley's Believe-it-or-not museum.\n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is that my experience at Primavera was the opposite of those things.  I had the tamale plate - one of each of the pork green chile and the beef with tomato salsa, plus black beans.  My boyfriend ordered something which I have forgotten the name of, but it was like two crispy giant tortilla chips stuffed with ricotta cheese and some other stuff... but mostly ricotta cheese.\n\n5 stars for my tamales.  3 for his tortilla thingy.  While both of them were mouth-meltingly good on the first few bites, my meal stood up to the test of time, and the test of 'oh my god I'm so full is it worth the stomachache to finish this?'.  Those tamales were complex and spicy and full of surprises at every bite.  The black beans - and I'm not even generally too crazy about black beans - were the best black beans I'd ever had.  I licked the plate clean of them.\n\nMy boyfriend's dish, however, just got very ricotta-cheesey the more of it I ate, and it definitely needed salsa to spice it up.\n\nBut our drinks!  Strawberry lemonade and pineapple-cucumber limeade, both ladled out of giant jars and clearly homemade.  The lemonade had nice crunchy seeds at the bottom that I gobbled up when I finished the drink.  In a uniquely Californian way, everything tasted like you were sipping the juice directly out of a fruit still swinging from the tree.\n\nAnd to the man who serenaded the group of kids by our table with an extended version of 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm', complete with realistic animal noises - thank you.

I just vacuumed up an entire plate of chilaquiles, topped off by a satisfying buddha-belly pat. The salsa-drenched tortillas were the perfect level of crisp, and balanced out the soft textures of the eggs, avocado, really fresh sour cream, and refried beans. Other reviews are right, the eggs aren't anything special; I also prefer the black beans that come with the tamale dish to these refried beans. But the whole plate comes together really really nicely, and I'm glad I was constrained to whatever was on my plate because I would not be able to stop if an entire platter was in front of me.\nAlso, drinks do not come with the meal. I must have just lucked out last time!", "author": "Michelle Y."}

I missed it last saturday and spent all week waiting until this saturday, planning my meal based off of reviews here. I'm a vegetarian, and a brunch lover and mexican food aficianado, so I was really emotionally invested in this experience. It was hard to find as it was lunch time and it was all the way in the back of the farmers market near the water. There were masses of people there and no way of discerning where the ordering line ended and the pick up line began. I just looked at the menu and  jumped in near the register. I couldn't decide between the chilequile and the tamale dish so I got one tamale ala cart. The chilequile dish was $9.50 and the tamale was $5 and I couldn't decide between the pineapple cucumber or strawberry limonade juice so I got them both for $7.50. I was so excited, and the long queue of people was validation so I couldn't imagine the impending let down after a week of build up.\n\nThe only thing on my order of any worth was the pineapple cucumber which earned this review one star, the other star was for using organic ingredients. It was sweet but not overly so and refreshing, perfect for the warm sunny weather. The strawberry limonade was very tart at the top and got sweeter towards the bottom, it was weird.  I was looking forward to this chilequile dish so I took one of the soggy but firm tortilla chip and I was already hating the texture and dipped it into the black beans (their refried pinto beans are NOT vegetarian) and was taken aback by the saltiness. I thought wow i'm going to be bloated from the fluid retention and sent into a hypertensive state. I was hoping it would get better but the second bite was less satisfying than the first. Then it hit me... It tastes exactly like soggy CHEESY DORRITOS with beans and eggs... gross. I couldn't believe I spent over $20 bucks for this. I took off a star for the saltiness of this food.\n\n I took off another when I went to taste the potato and swiss chard tamale and saw meat in it, they messsed up my order. They were apologetic but Instead of giving me a new tamale and they threw the entire plate away. I admonished the guy on being wasteful. They gave me a new plate right away. I should have opted then for the greasy chile relleno so that I could have tasted all of their lackluster offerings. I couldn't finish the chilequile plate, the swiss chard tamale wasn't any better, it lacked depth of flavor, had very little chard in it, it tasted like a mexican take on a  samosa but without the spices and crunchy textures of an indian one. The person next to me also had a plate full of that wet dorrito flavored tortilla chips that went uneaten. Don't waste your time here. If you still decide to go, think of soggy cheesy dorritos when you bite down and think of me saying I told ya so. BTW search for dorritos in other reviews. I'm not the only person who thought it tastes like processed junk food.", "author": "Onika C."}

This is easily the best Mexican breakfast I've ever had this side of the border. The tortillas used for the chips are thick, hearty, and rustic, and each bite unleashes an explosion of corn and peppery undertones that I've never experienced elsewhere. Then there's the aroma. Oh, the aroma. The chips have a subtle, loamy bouquet that reminds me of an earthen oven or wood chips from a smoker. Or maybe it's the sauce I'm smelling. Either way, I'm telling you, you gotta try it.\n\nAlthough the eggs and beans are the real meat of this dish, it's the seasoning and condiments that make it so extraordinary. For starters, Primavera uses Guajillo chiles in the salsa, which I rarely find in the States and I think adds much subtler, and richer, taste than jalape\u00f1os.

Despite the simple list of ingredients (tortilla chips, eggs, salsa, eggs, avocado, beans), it's not cheap, at nearly $10. But oh man, it's delicious. The tortilla chips are smothered in a spicy red sauce, yet manage to retain their crunch. The eggs are excellently scrambled, just cooked so that they're still soft. What you really want to do is eat everything in one bite, so scoop some beans and eggs onto a tortilla chip and enjoy. My one complaint is that I wish they gave a bit more eggs/bean and a little less chips for an improved ratio.", "author": "Ada T."}

The sauce was excellent too, and so was the rest of the plate: rice, beans, avocados and amazingly soft and fresh-tasting scrambled eggs. Really this is one of the better plates of chilaquiles I have ever had, and with their well-known hangover curing properties I could only look at my plate and wonder in vain, \"Where were you the day after Thanksgiving?\" The tamales on the other hand were a little dry and the masa fell apart too easily.

On most Saturday mornings I am able to resist the giant line of patrons waiting for Primavera's Mexican delights in order to wait in the giant line of people who feel it is perfectly acceptable to eat a herbbed pork sandwich at 9:00 am (my kind of people).  However on this particular Saturday morning I could smell the delicious aroma of battered fried fish from stands away and came to realize that Primavera was offering fish tacos!\n\n\"Screw you pork sandwich\" I thought to myself - I later apologized to Roli Roti in my head like a cheating husband to a devoted wife.  Anyway, I stood in line drooling over the promise of fish tacos in the morning, paid the nice lady and waited for my name to be called.  When I saw the plate of two heaping fish tacos I knew I was going to be happy.  Sure enough Primavera delivered and exceeded all of my fish taco expectations.  Perhaps the best part of these tacos is that the tortilla is so strong and pliable.  No wimpy thin tortillas that break in the center leaving the contents of your taco on the plate, these tortillas really stand up to the vast amounts of fish squeezed into the filling.  \n\nI can't say that I am leaving my porchetta sandwich for good, we have too much of a history to throw it all away.

Yes, believe it or not, I walk right past the Roli-roti porchetta line and head straight here. You have to keep walking past the ferry building on the right and past all the other vendors like Roli-roti and the Hog Island Oyster booth, come near the water and snake left a little bit.  Look for the line.  The star item on their menu is the chilaquiles.  Yes, when I first came, I thought $9.50 was insane for a plate of eggs that you get on a paper plate and have to eat while standing up or on a log.  \n\nBut then I had my first bite.  Wow, maybe it's the farm fresh eggs, maybe it's the fresh avocados and sour cream, maybe it's the thick, coated chips to eat your eggs on or the decadent refried beans, but I personally think it's the crack they must put in these eggs that make them so good!  You put some egg, some refried beans, some avocado and some salsa on these super thick chips and shove it in your mouth.  After a bit or two your plate starts looking like a mess but you won't care, you'll scrape the plate clean.\n\nWhen the husband and I used to come, we used to get other plates, like the tamales but trust me, they don't compare.  Then we tried getting two plates of chilaquiles but that was alot so now we compromise on sharing a plate of the eggs and a an agua fresca and trying something else at the market.  Make sure you get there early.  I've been a few times by noon or 1pm or so and they are out of the chilaquiles.  Also, a slight negative is that they let you put on the salsa to your own liking but they've engineered it with a shallow wooden spoon and a tall container so that you can only get like a tsp of salsa per scoop.  I personally am not fazed so I'll stand there and take 10 scoops while people wait but just wanted to warn the faint of heart.  Trust me, the salsa is worth it.

The black beans are to die for (and might kill you, methinks the secret is lard). Fish tacos are worth getting up early for.

They presented us with what looked liked a half eaten tamale (mind you, tamales already aren't too big to begin with) a tablespoon of beans and 1/2 cup of some type of slaw.... To boot, the tamale was cold.... all this my friends for over 9 dollars.. to me , this is one of those places where you don't have true ethic food going on.. you have perhaps some person who thinks they know good food.. if this person worked with Mexican Cuisine, it sure doesn't show... The food was all sub-par and so not worth the money. Again, we have now tried this place a few times and it's just not up to snuff...

The hubster and I were spending a weekend in SF to celebrate our anniversary (4 years of wedded bliss and 9 years total togetherness!)  and I really wanted to check out the farmers market at the ferry building.  Food stand after stand had us oohhing and ahhhing after all the baked goods, veggies and fruits.  Then my hubster saw this stand with an incredibly long line and saw that people were coming away with these fantastic looking plates of mexican food.  We kept walking to see if there was anything else that we wanted to eat, but once the hubster saw that mexican plate, he was adamant that we have our own mexican plate.  So we stood in line, which wasn't so bad, maybe 10 minutes.  Menu is very limited, so we went with the tamale plate which consisted of 2 tamales, side salad and side of beans.  They had a pork tamale with green chile sauce and a tamale with summer squash and cheese.  We opted to have one of each tamale for our plate.  Got our plate within a few minutes of ordering and found the quickest bench we could find so we could get our grub on.  That first bite was just awesome (my mouth is watering right now as I type this).  I first tried the summer squash and cheese tamale and was so impressed with how tasty it was.  I must say that I'm a masa lover.  I could care less about the filling because I'm just looking to savor the flavor of the masa.  The masa on these tamales was awesome.  I don't know how else to describe it.  The pork tamale was great too, but I'm not a fan of spicy foods and that green chile sauce was just a little hot for me to eat, but the hubster dug it.  The salad was just plain cabbage with a litlte dressing on it and it was nice to have since it cut the richness of the tamales.

The eggs were amazing, soft and melted in my mouth. I would definitely go again and try more items on the menu if I was in the ferry building on Saturday morning.", "author": "Will S."}
