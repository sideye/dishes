I was able to try many dishes as we were a large group that they accommodated - the yellow curry with beef and white rice, larb -tofu and chicken, a coconut soup (can't remember the name but it was unreal!!!

I'm a Thai food addict. You can find me in a Thai restaurant at least once a week. That's probably how I ended up in this place, right? Yes! I was past due to try a new spot, and so glad this was the one. Plus, I love giving exposure to spots in my neighborhood, as it's not one where many people actually make an effort to drive here for unless it's worth it.\n\nThe food here is cooked to perfection, the vibe (especially for a tiny little Thai place) was welcoming, the service was quick/efficient/friendly (think of basically any synonym to these words and they fit the bill). Now, on to the food itself- and trust me, there was a lot of it. For the appetizer I ordered the \"Spicy Eggplant Tofu\" (sauteed eggplant,tofu, bell pepper, onion, fresh chili and basil in garlic soy bean sauce). This thing is mouth watering! It's an entree dish, but I highly recommend it as an appetizer (though you really can't go wrong with the Satay Chicken. The peanut sauce is fantastic). For the entree I ordered the Red Curry (chicken with green bean, zucchini, bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil). Man! What makes this place so great is how much food they give compared to their price. I would consider this spot one of the cheaper options, yet the food is easily comparable to more high end Thai restaurants. Sorry for the side note, the Red Curry is such a solid option. The third dish was the Pad See Ew (stir fried flat rice noodles with garlic, egg, carrot and broccoli) and usually I have that with my Red Curry (it's such a perfect blend of perfection!). \n\nFinal verdict: Outer Sunset is a district where you really have to make an effort to explore before finding that hidden gem. There's little foot traffic, and it's up to us to help with the exposure of small little spots on Yelp. This place nails a trifecta in terms of food, service and ambiance.

It's a small restaurant, but it's the ambiance is relaxing and the decor is beautiful. Who would have ever guessed all of this was hiding behind the tacky red awning and run down store front that appeared outside! \n\nI started off with a Thai iced tea. It came in the cutest mason jar glass. Super unique. There are quite a few options on the menu and our waiter could tell I was overwhelmed and stepped in to help without hesitation. He have us great suggestions and even helped us save some money!! We got the Panang Curry, our waiters suggestion, and it  was DELICIOUS. Not too spicy but just the right amount of zing! Mix it with a little fried rice and it's a match made in heaven. And when it does get a little to hot to handle, a sip of their mouth watering Thai ice tea makes everything better.  \n\nThank you for a great dinner, great service, and an overall great night.

Not that I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants but this is the best one that I've been to. My husband and I have been going here even when we were still dating. The place is pretty small but I can say that the quality of the food is still excellent. I think that it underwent new ownership since we first ate here in 2010 but they just made everything better. It feels more intimate and relaxing than before. Everything is just so flavorful and they make really good Pad Thai and Panang Curry. Those are our \"must-have\" dishes when we go there but there are other dishes that are also good. Ahhh, thinking about it makes me want to go there right now.

I also thought that the service was decent, although the waiter was a bit shy, she was definitely very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, despite all of these good qualities, I found the food to be rather disappointing. The pad thai had an overpowering taste of tomato sauce, my boyfriend found an eyelash/eyebrow hair in his prawns, the prawns didn't taste very fresh, and the portions are small. So although I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, I will most likely not be coming back.", "author": "Cindy L."}

It is a small, intimate restaurant located just a couple blocks from the Ocean way out in the sunset district. It's very convenient to Golden Gate park. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming. The service is over the top kind and attentive. The food - just plain delicious. Many people consider Thai to be \"too spicy\" but this place is a good example of well-balanced flavor profiles prepared to your spiciness preference. They have many of the standard Thai dishes but also some real stand-outs such as \"cottage duck\", a preparation that reminded me of Peking duck. The Thai beef salad was amazingly good with a bright, vinegar-based sauce. The crispy chicken with noodles was also delicious - my kids loved that dish. For dessert - coconut creme brulee - outrageously good.\n\nHighly recommended. There is some reference here on Yelp that this place is closed and that is inaccurate.", "author": "Clay K."}

Noodles were cooked to perfection. There were two very small shrimp, one fish ball, and about a palm-full of ground chicken. It filled me up and was very flavorful but could use some more ingredients.\n2/5 Service: There was only one woman working alone at 6:30 on a saturday night. Not enough service staff. But I almost feel bad giving such a low rating because she was very VERY nice and was trying her hardest (despite there only being 8 tables in the place). From order to check processing it was a 55 minute experience. Fine that I wasn't in a hurry but I can usually be in and out in half hour for a simple dinner like that. \n5/5 Ambiance: Very cute place. Small, quaint, clean, and pleasant.

What would normally make for uncomfortable dining, is actually a welcome respite from the cold and fog that lurks outside.  At a maximum seating capacity of 18, it's a small restaurant.  Take a minute or two to peek at their carefully designed website; it's not only useful for their menu, but also very informative on Thai cuisine.\n\nSince Thai is few and far between in this area, this place is excellent for those in the neighborhood.

When we arrived at this little hole in the wall, I knew it wasn't going to be a good experience.  There was only one waitress, and she looked really frazzled.  It took her several minutes to clean a table for us, and then after we were seated, it took her about 10 minutes for her to come back and give us some menus.  We literally had to flag her down just to give her our order.  Then, two of the dishes we wanted to order were no longer available.  What?? It was like an hour until close.  You really don't have spring rolls anymore? I give the place one star for the food.  It was pretty darn good and the sauces were really flavorful.  I really wanted to like this place, but the slow and spotty service is enough to keep me away.", "author": "Julie P."}

After my first visit at Thai Cottage restaurant, I can't help going back to taste more different dishes.  In the recent 2 weeks, I visited four times there. So far my favorites are Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup, Tom Yum Noodle soup and Duck Fried Rice. I personally think those dishes are must try if you visit Thai Cottage in first time. The portion of dishes is good as well with the price. Actually, this restaurant is not too big and fancy, but it is comfortable to have a dinner date.

They were both good, even though the portions were fairly small. However, the reason why I gave it a three is because the two times I was there, they screwed up on my change. In the first occasion, the waitress short changed me. The second time, the waiter overcharged me. Though the food tasted good, but the waiters need to be more professional.", "author": "Bon T."}

It was 9:50 when we found Thai Cottage open, and went in.  After explaining our situation, Sabrina, the proprietor, said that even though she had closed the kitchen, she would never send away hungry people, and prepared us wonderful noodles and soup to take home.  We have gone to eat there many times since and have eaten many of the menu items.  Every one has been a  winner (Tiger Cried salad!).  The restaurant is small, well-decorated with a cheerful electric fire on cold nights.  Sabrina recently hired a very nice server who knows the menu,  We had two apps, 1 soup, 2 beers,  4 mains and 2 desserts for 4 people most recently, and the most expensive item was $8.00.  The total bill was $60.00.  And the food was, as usual, exquisite.  The dessert we wanted was not on the menu, it was something we asked for, and it came beautifully garnished with fresh herbs and a strawberry coulis.\n\nThai Cottage is aptly named, because it's a cozy place with a warm and accommodating proprietor who works hard to make one feel welcome and well-fed. We urge you to give it a try.", "author": "Diane S."}

The atmosphere is nice, a definite first date scene. The service, very well set up, the server is there to see if you are comfortable and all is well, but not overbearing. The wine selection, Sabrina has impressed me with every bottle she has chosen for my party each time, with full satisfaction of her choice. The food OMG - I've been to the Thai Cottage several times and each time, i have been well satisfied with each dish I taste. The Pumpkin Curry is by far my favorite. But then again there are a lot of dishes I'm still looking forward to try. Going back this week - can't wait. Major thumbs up for Sabrina and her husband - you rock,", "author": "Yolanda G."}

We live in the area and we are so delighted that we found this amazing thai food restaurant. Service was lovely, not too quick, just right time to cook food from scratch. Very clean, lovely atmosphere and wonderful service. I think it would suit groups of 5 and under and a lovely place to take your date.

The menu is surprisingly extensive.  I knew these people took their cuisine seriously though when I first tried the salmon and was pleasantly surprised by a nice cut of fish, perfectly prepared, crispy on the edges.  Many of the selections are quite authentic and probaby appeal most to the seasoned Thai palat.  I'm so glad that Thai Cottage has persevered for so long out here on the coast, especially considering it has often been empty or nearly so when I have eaten there.", "author": "Laura C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-07", "description": "The worst thing about this place is the promptness of the service, or lack thereof.  My daughters and I had dinner there on a Friday night; it  wasn't terribly busy, and there's only one server for the tiny restaurant.  We were seated right away, but then had to wait awhile before we got menus.  Then waited some more before our order was taken.  My daughters' Thai iced tea came out pretty quickly, but then I had to send it back because my younger daughter found some crud dangling at the end of the straw.  Food finally came out, but then my water didn't come out until after I had already started eating.  (By contrast, I saw another couple who received their water right away, so was it me?)  Then we had to wait some more just to get our food boxed up and for our check.   I am not an unreasonable person: I know that there was only one server, but not every table was full, and the restaurant was tiny.  The amount of time that we had to wait and wait was unexcusable in my book. Even my older daughter remarked as soon as we left, \"That place didn't have very good service.\"  We didn't even stay for dessert even though we love Thai desserts because we were tired of waiting!\n\nThe food is OK, have definitely had better at Marnee or even King of Thai, but it's fine at Thai Cottage, on the whole.  My daughters had the Gai Pad Gra Prow (Chicken with Basil), and I had a dish of prawns and scallops with a touch of curry sauce.  The sauce was tasty, but my scallops were overcooked and rubbery.", "author": "Sun L."}
