We both agreed that there was not any dish that we really loved. Everything was ok, with the croquetas being the best of the bunch. \n\nThe restaurant was packed and loud, because all diners are yelling in order to be heard.

Came here with my bf on a Tuesday night for a late dinner.\n\nVenue / Service: well-lit interior and plenty of space to walk around/ sit down.  They also have outdoor seating with canopies.  Definitely didn't have a feeling of being cramped or in tight spaces, though it might have also been because we came in during a quiet time (8:30/9pm weekday). Service was pretty good- they came by frequently to check in and make sure we were done with dishes before they served the next one, waters were filled, etc.\n\nJam\u00f3n Serrano (Monte Nevado, Aged 15-20 Months, Rioja)($16) - lightly salted and still very savory!  My bf and I love jamon though this was a rather large portion of jamon; just enough bread to accompany the jamon too.\n\nWood Oven Roasted Monterey Sardine and Avocado Toast (Pickled Onions, Smoked Salt)($3.50 per toast) - huge fan of sardines and this was a pretty good toast.  Surprised that they were able to get the sardine less salty by pairing it with avocado and onions and thankfully the toast wasn't too thick.\n\nCroqueta de Jam\u00f3n Serrano (Crisp and Creamy Fritter of Spanish Serrano Ham)($3.50 per piece) - hard to go wrong with a croquette; this one was deliciously cheesy and not too much breading on the outside.  Lot of ham chunks inside too so you can really taste it!\n\nLittle Gem Salad (Roasted Beets, Garlic Chips, Mint, Sherry Mustard Vinagreta)($13) - recommended by our waitress out of the salads selection.  The mint and vinaigrette really made this salad, adding a lightness that was much needed in an otherwise somewhat-heavy meal.   \n\nSquid-Ink Seafood Paella (??) - Tuesday nights are paella night and so we ordered the special paella.  Yay for the plentiful seafood on the paella- they also included small bits of cod which I particularly liked.  Was kinda bummed that they didn't include the soccarat at the bottom of the paella, since I personally LOVE the crispy rice that you would normally find at the bottom of a paella.  The paellas are MASSIVE btw; I bet 3 people would be satisfied assuming they ordered tapas as well- we barely finished half of it.\n\nButterscotch Flan (Fresh Strawberries, Dark Chocolate-Sea Salt Cookie)($9) - loved the flan and a great way to end the meal!  Not too creamy/ heavy, and the caramel was salted a bit to cut the sweetness.\n\nLittle bit on the expensive side overall, but we were pretty satisfied with the quality of food- I'd place it as one of the top tapas places I've been to in SF so far.  Might not frequent it much as I would like to since it is a bit far for me to get to, but I would gladly put it on the top of the list in terms of places to try good tapas.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The overall interior of the restaurant is very comfortable and warm, but also very spacious for a SF restaurant. We sat in the outdoor segment where it was well heated and well-lit (5/5). \n\nFood: I believe most of the menu are smaller sized tapas, though some dishes may be more filling than others such as the short-ribs. What I love about the food is that the ingredients are kept simple to only compliment the dish as opposed to restaurants that use many ingredients to try to create something sophisticated. (5/5)\n\nFor example, the short ribs had roasted almond and cauliflower that perfectly balanced the meaty taste all while adding a crunchy texture. The meatballs were very fresh, juicy, but not too overpowering. We also tried the coca flatbread, which was interesting because of the broccoli rabes, but it was pretty good as it added texture. The only dishes I wasn't really impressed by were the ones with sardines in them, but maybe I'm not just a fan of sardines to begin with. However, I can say that they paired the dish well to minimize the fishy taste. As for drinks, the sparkling sangria is nice and minty and has some pomegranate at the bottom.", "author": "Angus L."}

Or, how about a squid dish that was overwhelmed by chorizo? Or, how about 2 meatballs that were just uninspiring?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-18", "description": "I've always shyed away from tapas, since it usually entails copious amounts of decision-making for each small plate, which then rack up a daunting bill and may still leave you hungry. However I found myself quite fond of Contigo with its Tuesday special tasting menu ft. a giant pan of paella at $40/person.... First world problems solved.\n\nThe unique Spanish/Catalan flavors, combined with the fresh and sustainable sourcing in Californian spirit, in a cozy rustic space create a memorable dining adventure. I especially appreciated how all the dishes were carefully prepared with marked attention to detail in composition and quality. \n\nDespite its favorable Michelin rating, the service and atmosphere were gracious and not the least bit pretentious. One could describe it as homecooked Barcelona fine cuisine, though the Yelp brand of Spanish tapas bar speaks to its classiness. \n\n(+) Wood Oven Roasted Monterey Sardine and Avocado Toast, Pickled Onions, Smoked Salt ($3): Lol, of course there has to be avo toast in an SF restaurant. As denizens accustomed to chunky avocado toast, Contigo's version is a bit of a tease with its thin bread and light smear of avocado, used primarily to add a creamy dimension to contrast the savory sardine and sour pickled onions. The sardines are a feat in themselves, not fishy at all and not overpowered by salt or smokiness.\n\n(++) Croqueta de Jam\u00f3n Serrano ($3.50): Mmm, a crispy panko-like exterior surrounding a lusciously creamy filling, interspersed with Spanish ham. It's hard to appreciate the artisan jambon on its own the way you can focus on charcuterie board cuts, but the croquet as a whole is comfort-food tasty. Caution that the inside is really hot when it arrives, so you may want to take your sweet time on cross section pictures and such.\n\n(++) Hand Picked Dungeness Crab Salad, Chicories, Clementines, Avocado, Fennel, Lime Vinagreta ($16): Arguably among the most interesting salads I've had; it utilized the bitterness of chicory and made it very palatable by placing it in stark contrast to tangy clementines and lime vinaigrette, the earthiness of fennel, and the creaminess of pulled crab and avocado. \n\n(++) Smashed Pumpkin Tosta, Wild Mushrooms, Idiaz\u00e1bal, Baby Mustard Greens, Pepitas ($14) Although the trendiness of pumpkin is restricted to PSL season, I enjoyed the winter veggies take on toast. I think I would have liked more variety in the tasting menu than two toasts; nonetheless this turned out an excellent combination of familiar pumpkin with hearty mushrooms and rich smokey idiazabal. The hard cheese shavings are similar to Italian parmigiano reggiano, except it's made from sheep and has more zing.\n\n(+++) Seafood Paella of Jumbo Gulf Shrimp, California Rock Cod, Monterey Squid, Clams, Baby Artichokes, Saffron, Alioli: I was actually starting to get full before we even got to the paella, and then the huge pan arrived, occupying most of the table space. The paella is deliciously al dente like risotto, sauteed with a mix of saffron and tomato-based aioli. The seafood was also very generous, and the jumbo gulf shrimp were jumbo indeed. The shrimp was possibly my favorite item of the night--juicy, meaty, and a hint of peppery. Also, bonus points to the aesthetics. While paella is usually a hodgepodge, Contigo added flairs of microgreens, an artsy swirl of white sauce, and a fancy charred lemon.\n\nOverall, I think Contigo excels the most in balance; it boldly experiments with contrasting flavors which turn out surprisingly delicious. Prices are also very reasonable considering the large portions. (It's the first time in awhile we couldn't finish our food!)\n\nNote: prices listed are referenced from the regular menu. I'm not sure how they portion out the tasting menu for different numbers of people. If I were to go by myself, I wonder if I would get the same amount of food :3\n\nContigo is situated in the relatively quiet neighborhood of Noe Valley, where the small cluster of stores and restaurants is reminiscent of a quaint downtown of a smaller town--an alcove in SF where you can breathe and relax for a peaceful dinner (and find parking.)", "author": "Edna C."}

Contigo is a Spanish Tapas restaurant serving farm to table dishes family style. Since they serve seasonal foods, their menu changes quite often.\n\nMy husband came on a Sunday night for date night and since I'm not familiar with Spanish cuisine, we opted for the Tapas Tasting Menu (chef's selection of 7 of their best dishes served family style) for $48/person. It does not include dessert though...The portions are generous so you will get very full!\n\nBoquerones (White Anchovies), Avocado, Lemon Zest, Espelette on Toast - I love how flavorful the tomato spread was! But our bread was so soggy and I think because there has been an avocado shortage in California, ours didn't come with avocado...\n\nCroqueta de Jam\u00f3n Serrano - Crisp and Creamy Fritter of Spanish Serrano Ham - Crispy on the outside, creamy with ham on the inside. Delicious!\n\nOxtail Hamburguesita, Salsa Secreta, Pickled Onions, chips - the bun was cold and all I could taste on the chips were the red seasoning (paprika?) and it was too overwhelming. The oxtail was moist and flavorful though.\n\nSeared Ca\u00f1a de Cabra Goat Cheese, Chicories, Persimmons, Pomegranates, Hazelnuts - the seared goat cheese was sooo good! Persimmons were sweet and both cheese, persimmon and pomegranate flavors intensified each other.\n\nSeared McFarland Springs Trout - Brown Butter Squash Pur\u00e9e, Romanos, Meyer Lemon Mojo - Very moist and flaky fish, brown butter squash pur\u00e9e was very sweet and creamy paired very well together with the trout.\n\nMonterey chipirones (Squid) a la Plancha, Arroz Negro, Chorizo, Ink, Artichokes, Alioli - Maybe I'm not used to Spanish grains but the black grains was very hard and chewy. Overall flavor of the dish was good.\n\nAlb\u00f3ndigas - Pork, Lamb and Jam\u00f3n Meatballs, Tomato Sherry Sauce - felt like this dish was a bit out of place because it felt more like an appetizer!

Asking for some advice from our waiter, here's what we enjoyed:\n\nTapas\n1) Boquerones (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4VhP4B71bHzq4Y5NFaaOgw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - white anchovies, avocado, lemon zest, espellete on toast.

Not overly fishy, the avocado spread tamed the seafood flavor here.\n\nRaciones frias\n2) Melon con jamon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KUtemOeLxn1ugHIhyjll3g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Jamon Serrano, melon, mint, black pepper syrup, roasted pistachios.  Call it a Spanish take on prosciutto and cantaloupe, let's confirm, yes, it works.\n\nRaciones caliente\n3) Samfaina (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SFY3Kh7X8mzBxE8ZfMcp9A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Catalan summer vegetables ratatouille  roasted in wood oven with farm egg.  My favorite of the small dishes, country style heartiness.\n\n4) Monterey chipirones (squid) a la plancha (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jOsONF9AEut8PiUqVIWN1w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - shelling beans, Nardello peppers, chorizo, aioli.  Reminds me more of roasted octopus, but it is squid.\n\n5) Lamb rib chops (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gH4YpwMdMaRpP4ficNwqbg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)- piracicaba, smoked potatoes, cumin yogurt, preserved lemon charmoula. Just as lamb should taste, without a trace of gaminess.\n\n6) Albondigas (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0sGfy3nUsmZSn-8v4y5JJw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - pork, lamb, and jamon meatballs, tomato sherry sauce.  Give me a bowl of rice or a plate of noodles!  This would disappear with every last drop of the sauce.\n\nOur waiter was attentive in removing and bringing plates as well as refilling water and drink glasses as needed.  It was a very relaxed environment since we came before dark.  However, you'll need to order more if you are hungry or have a hearty appetite.  My friend somewhat joked about having a bowl of Thai noodle soup to finish the evening, so we compromised and went to Mitchell's for some ice cream for dessert.\nNice neighborhood spot and away from the heavy foot traffic 24th Street corridor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-02", "description": "Contigo was a fantastic tapas/Spanish restaurant in the heart of Noe Valley. I came for dinner in a group of three on a Friday night, and I found that the food and service here were both excellent, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was so welcoming and modern. \n\nAfter ordering a bottle of Bobol red wine to share, we were started off with bread and olive oil for the table. Our first dish to share was the seared goat cheese salad, which came with chicories, persimmons, apples, pomegranate, hazelnut, and a toasted crouton. This dish was absolutely delicious and perhaps one of my favorites that we tried--the salad was so lightly but perfectly dressed in a slightly acidic vinaigrette, and everything paired so well together--the freshness of the vegetables/fruit, the creaminess of the cheese, and the crunchiness of the crouton.\n\nNext, we had the oxtail hamburguesita, which was a hamburger \"patty\" made of strips of pulled, braised oxtail served with pickled onions in a bun. This dish was great, as the beef was so tender, but perhaps a tiny bit underseasoned. We also had the jamon crouquetas (fried fritter with serrano ham), which was nice and creamy, but not as hearty/savory as the name suggests. \n\nWe continued our meal with the smashed pumpkin tosta, which was basically pureed pumpkin on toast (with some other ingredients) and the espinacas con garbonzos (spinach and chickpea stew with moorish spices). Both of these dishes were decent with very clean flavors, but nothing all that mind-blowing. Finally, we finished with the squid a la plancha (also one of my favorites of the night), which was grilled calamari over roasted Brussels sprouts--the squid and the sprouts were unbelievably flavorful, and the dish also had a very nice texture to it. We also had the albondigas (the pork/lamb/jamon meatballs), which were so juicy and tender, but the tomato sauce that the meatballs were drenched it wasn't particularly flavorful and left something to be desired.\n\nOverall, Contigo offered some excellent food with clean flavors (definitely nothing too salty here, as I sometimes find in some tapas restaurants) and extremely friendly service.

Even Japanese izakayas here refer to themselves as tapas spots to cash in on the small plate trend. Like a lot of people around here, I was drawn to Contigo when I watched the three foodie guests rave about it on \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" a couple of years ago. Funny thing is that Jamie W. and I ended up visiting several other tapas joints in the city in the meantime - Beso, Canela, Bocadillos, Coqueta - before finding an excuse to meet up here with our friend Maggie in Noe Valley. We entered to see the wood-burning oven in full roar, and fortunately it was just starting to fill since the space is pretty compact.\n\nWe were a bit hesitant to be seated in the back patio since it was a particularly chilly evening, but they amped up the heat lamp in preparation for our arrival. It just felt comfortable back there next to the chopped wood and watching the more high-maintenance diners insist on being reseated indoors. Jamie and I both ordered the $11 Sparkling Sangria, which was a refreshing starter with cava, blood orange, lillet and rosemary (photo: http://bit.ly/1Y1fb8z), while Maggie had a $12 glass of the 2015 Ostatu Tempranillo/Garnacha, a crispy ros\u00e9 ideal for what we were about to eat (photo: http://bit.ly/1SGINo1). We started with the $15 Seared Ca\u00f1a de Cabra Goat Cheese over a bed of arugula and radicchio with citrus, hazelnuts and PX vinagreta (photo: http://bit.ly/1QKt84O).\n\nIt was lovely and easy to share with the cheese reflecting the perfect soft consistency with a nice crust from the grill. Next came a trio of small bites on a serving paddle, the delicious Smoked Salmon Montadito with yogurt, truffle honey on toast, quimet and quimet style ($4 each, photo: http://bit.ly/1TDKyVm). Another trio came in quick succession, the Boquerones, Spanish white anchovies on toast with a spread of avocado and a splash of Meyer lemon ($2.50 each, photo: http://bit.ly/23gYkA3). The freshness of the fish made this my favorite of the two true tapas of the evening. We then graduated to the raciones calientes with the spectacular $15 Asparagus a la Plancha (photo: http://bit.ly/24tw2Vn).\n\nThe impeccably fresh asparagus were flash-fried on a grill and served with an olive oil-fried farm egg, mojama (salt-cured tuna), and piment\u00f3n almonds. The succulent $18 Local Dungeness Crab was a seasonal dish prepared simply by roasting it in the oven and seasoning it with black pepper, paprika, garlic and butter (photo: http://bit.ly/1pW9c9f). It came with an Asian-inspired hot chile sauce as well as some rustic bread for wiping up what was left of the sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1QKt0T4). But wait, there was more. Next came the $13 trio of Alb\u00f3ngidas, hearty meatballs made of pork, lamb and jam\u00f3n swimming in a piquant tomato sherry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1NeZbQ1). It really made me wish we made room for more of the jam\u00f3n.\n\nThe $10 Patatas Bravas are probably the most common dish to be seen on a tapas table, or at least we order them as a must. These are no exceptions with the crispy-soft fried texture perfect and the accompanying aioli and salsa brava generous for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/1W0Fjm6). This could be my favorite rendition of this Spanish standby. Finally came our hot ticket item, the $25 Lamb Rib Chops with broccoli, smoked potatoes, cumin yogurt, and preserved lemon charmoula (photo: http://bit.ly/1Y1eY5n). Even though it was logistically difficult to split two chops for three, the effort was worth it for the juicy tenderness of the lamb. You would think at this point that we were done, but no, since the guy on \"Check, Please!\" raved about the churros, well...\n\nFor $9, we managed to snag four of the legendary Churros, sugary doughnut pipes quite hot to the touch, while indulging in the Chocolate Caliente, a cup of thick Barcelona-style TCHO chocolate sprinkled with sea salt (photo: http://bit.ly/1Y1f1y2). Decadent richness with or without the churros which were a tad too sweet for my taste. Maggie had the wherewithal to order the $8 Brokaw Ranch Clementine Sorbete, a refreshing end to the meal with the snap of the sweet lemon shortbread (photo: http://bit.ly/1QKtEjp). All the while, the service was accommodating without being intrusive, and even as the patio started to crowd with equally enthusiastic diners, it never felt rushed or deafening. I think Contigo may very well reign supreme in the competitive tapas market.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...impreccably prepared from small plates to main dishes with a thick hot chocolate for the ages\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...compact space but comfortable in the back patio where conversations can be held without fuss\nSERVICE - 5 stars...you can tell when long-time staffers serve you\nTOTAL - 5 stars...definitely my favorite tapas spot in the city bar none", "author": "Ed U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-17", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nGood food? Yes, but it was definitely not what I expected from a Spanish restaurant.\n\nContigo has a Catalan-inspired menu in that you'll find a lot of Mediterranean flavors in their dishes (I.E. \"Moorish spices,\" couscous, chickpeas). I was craving Spanish comfort food/tapas and had a hearty meal. But were my cravings satisfied? No.\n\nI don't just eat Spanish food because I'm craving gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas, or even manchego/jamon serrano. I ain't no basic bitch! I love Spanish cuisine for the flavors; some pimenton, some garlic, some saffron, some good olive oil. Contigo just caught me off guard because they highlight the Mediterranean and it just wasn't what I was looking for. It was comparable to eating at a Moroccan restaurant, tbh.\n\nThat said, I'm not docking off stars because the restaurant is \"Not Spanish\"; it totally is Spanish. After all, the Moors occupied Spain for hundreds of years and even dominated up to 70% of the country at one point in time. 3 stars is more of a reflection of how I felt about my meal; it just fell short.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Hot DATE: Not the best bacon wrapped dates I've had, so I was pretty underwhelmed. I could skip this.\n-CROQUETA de Jam\u00f3n Serrano: Also not the best croquettes I've had. These were the consistency of the hash browns at McDonalds, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I expected something more refined.\n-Salt Cured Spanish ANCHOVY MONTADITO: I'm one of those people who really likes anchovies, so this was a guilty pleasure of mine. I liked the house made mat\u00f3 cheese (whey cheese of ricotta consistency). Black pepper was a little overpowering though. I'm in no position to offer menu changes but tomato would've been a great combo w/ the mat\u00f3 and anchovy.\n-ALBONDIGAS: Very Mediterranean tasting. The sauce was good and reminded me of shakshuka with hints of harissa (or at least the ingredients of harissa aka bell peppers, paprika, etc.). The meatballs themselves left something to be desired though because I couldn't really detect the different meats\n-ESPINACAS CON GARBANZOS: Super flavorful and maybe my favorite thing that we ordered, but again this was a more Mediterranean dish. It tasted like an amped up hummus. Technically this dish is more from Andalucia/Sevilla than Catalonia, but whatever it's good! ;)\n-COLIFLOR- Kind of limp and not crispy :( I still ate it all because I needed some vegetable and the cauliflower was nicely seasoned.\n-JAMON SERRANO & MANCHEGO pasamontes: We ordered this as more of an afterthought for familiarity. Served with rustic country bread, membrillo, and hazelnuts, I'm glad we got this.\n\nI actually came here for the tripe with chorizo and chickpeas (which I'm assuming is their take on menudo gitano?), but they weren't serving it. Callos is one of my favorite Spanish dishes ever, but I guess this was just not my night :(\n\nOther notes:\n-I really liked the staff. Both people helping us were pretty cool and our waiter was very funny.\n-Completely farm to table menu, awesome\n-No pitchers of sangria; sparkling sangria is $11/glass and very pretty w/ pomegranate seeds\n-Wines are all from Spain. $11-15 for a 5oz pour, $60 and up for a bottle, half bottles also available", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

I recall the night before at a party, a nice woman and I met for the first time and we bonded over our travels and food. She raved about this restaurant and that's how Yvonne and I ended up at Contigo, a Michelin recommended restaurant in the sleepy part of Noe. That evening the street parking was aplenty and it felt a nice relief to be able to park and walk straight into the restaurant, which was crowded.\n\nFor women who are watching their waistline, this is an excellent restaurant with a lot of one bite options I think tapas should all look like this. These little one bites are delightful and quite complicated to assemble. Definitely do the quail eggs and Spanish white anchovies, What a delightful sight. Almost too pretty to eat.\n\nFor the shared plates, the tripe reminds me a lot of the Italian version at Cockscomb in SoMA and the traditional German Swabian dishes found in Stuttgart. I liked it quite a lot, for all those nice flavors evoked my memories of last year dining at Cockscomb and getting all excited about their menu, and my past travels to one of my favorite regions in Germany. The Monterrey squid was a nice plate of fresh tender squids with good veggies around it. Makes me want to give that dish a swirl at home. So healthy and fun to eat. Oxtail mini burgers were very hearty and the buns were exceptional, so for someone who does not want to do carbs, please just simply give in and take a bite at that damn heavenly thing already. \n\nThere are a tasting menu on the offering. For an average American male I think that's the way to go, for two petite Asian women, that would eat up our entire weekend's calories. So we did not go for that option.\n\nThe decaf is lovely at the end of the meal, especially if you go with their house dessert choice of flour less cake.\n\nI know very little about Spanish food. But this is for sure one of the nicer ones out there, the attention to the detail was clearly present. The things that shined the most are their one bite tapas. I still think about the quail egg and spanish fish toasts.\n\nI'm a terrible party goer, the woman I met at the party handed me her card, she is also an accomplished musician. I had promised to get in touch after the party to catch up. But... I think I left her card at the party and I'm too embarrassed to ask the host what her contact info is. I couldn't remember her name or her band name, but I did remember going to her favorite Spanish spot in town immediately after the party. So I guess in the grand scheme of things, I did have my priorities straight.", "author": "Victoria E."}

We were hungry so the starch settled our stomach as well\n\nNext was the smoked trout salad.  Very refreshing and tasty.  Smoked trout was salty as you would expect so we asked for some bread.

Really good. \n\n5th course grilled squid with squid ink rice.  The squid was perfected charred.  Hubby loves the rice.  \n\n6th course - halibut wrapped in a leaf.  I almost asked not to serve this one as I have never been a halibut fan.  Not enough flavor not soft enough.    Boy was I happy to keep this dish. Was delicious and the lentil was very flavorful and a perfect compliment. Definitely getting this again\n\nLast course - albondigas.  Pork and lamb meatball.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-12", "description": "TLDR - cozy ambience and yummy tapas! opt for the tasting menu if you don't know what to get, but make sure you get the croquetas and squid!\n\nI'm not sure why, but for some reason, I really love tapas. I don't know if it's the tiny portions and me liking tiny things or if it's the shared plates and me liking to try a little bit of a lot of dishes, but a tapas restaurant is pretty much always a good choice for me, so I ended up picking Contigo to have my birthday dinner with friends. Not sure if reservations are usually needed/recommended since we came for an early dinner, but they take them so might as well make one in case.\n\nThe restaurant is modern and trendy but still has a cozy, intimate atmosphere. There's normal seating and bar seating inside, but my friends and I chose to sit on the patio out back. Limited seating out there though!\n\nThe menu has a good selection of tapas ranging from single bites to small plates to larger \"entree\" plates as well as beer and wine. I had done my Yelp research beforehand so I knew what I wanted, but since most of those dishes ended up being on the tasting menu for the night, we ended up just going with that. \n\nService was great! Our waiter was super friendly, energetic and very attentive. Food came out at a good pace, but each dish came out one at a time and I wish they had brought out multiple at once, but only more so for pictures than anything else.. (yes, guilty as charged)\n\nFood overall was pretty good. The tapas I loved and would recommend ended up being the ones that Yelp had recommended and that I had wanted to get in the first place: CROQUETAS, MONTEREY XIPIRONS (squid) and ALBONDIGAS (meatballs). The HALIBUT was pretty good too. The rest were mostly pretty forgettable - still really good but not special enough for me to want to order them again. If you're indecisive and/or unsure of what to order, then the tasting menu is definitely a good option! Otherwise, just skip the tasting menu and order what you actually want to try. There are definitely things on the menu I wish I had gotten instead of some things in the tasting. \n\nOur TASTING MENU ($46/person) consisted of:\n\n-GULF SHRIMP (off menu) - 3/5\nDidn't really leave an impression on me, neither good nor bad. Just normal shrimp. \n\n-CROQUETA DE JAMON SERRANO (normally $3.50 each) - 5/5\n[crisp and creamy fritter of spanish serrano ham]\nPerfectly fried! Crispy on the outside without being greasy, and creamy and savory on the inside without being too cheesy. Nice contrast of textures.\n\n-WARM DELICATA SQUASH SALAD (normally $14) - 3/5\n[chanterelles, pomegranate, fennel, frisee, shaved idiazabal]\nNothing memorable. The squash was cooked well but there was nothing special about the flavors or the salad in general. Not really worth getting.\n\n-SAMFAINA (normally $15) - 3.5/5\n[catalan autumn vegetable ratatouille, topped with farm egg]\nI love runny, undercooked eggs! Aside from that, the ratatouille was made well - veggies were tender and not too salty - but didn't really stand out much.\n\n-MONTEREY XIPIRONS (SQUID) A LA PLANXA (normally $16) - 5/5\n[arros negre, chorizo, ink, baby artichokes, allioli, guindilla chile]\nYUM. Superrr tender squid! Plump and full of flavor. I've never had squid ink before and thought it would have a more distinctive/unique taste, but while savory and tasty, the rice/ink was more normal than I expected. Also supposed to be a little spicy but I didn't feel any of the chile/heat. Definitely recommend!!\n\n-OLIVE OIL FRIED ALASKAN HALIBUT (normally $27) - 4/5\n[\"gazpacho salad\" of tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, croutons, basil allioli]\nBeautifully plated! Halibut was incredibly moist and flaky and, like the croquetas, perfectly crispy on the outside. The basil allioli was deeeeelicious!\n\n-ALBONDIGAS (normally $13) - 4/5\n[pork, lamb and jamon meatballs in tomato sherry sauce]\nMeaty, tender and juicy. Well-cooked, but I didn't find the flavor of the meatballs or the tomato sauce to be special or unique. Still really tasty though so I'd probably order it again.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The octopus pinchos came out super well because the octupus was cooked to perfect. Not rubbery at all and the right amount of seasoning with the pepper as well combined made for the perfect bite. The asparagus came out cooked right with the asaparagus bitterness nowhere to be found. The albondigas (meatballs) were tender and had the right lamb/pork/jamon mix in it. The tomato sherry sauce was also great on it. The patatas bravas were fried to the right crisp and the salsa brava was to die for. Finally, the churro con chocolate was the creme de la creme with the right amount of fullness and richness to the chocolate.

It was noisy in the dining area, but not overly loud.  Tables are placed close to one another.\n\nParking was relatively easy as we found several parking spots within one block of the restaurant.  Reservations are a must for large parties.  I would say this restaurant is geared towards adults looking for a fun and lively night out.  While we were there our table was the only one with children.", "author": "Melissa L."}

As an elite yelper to tell their followers and fellow yelpers it sucks to write one of these one star reviews on a restaurant you would give five stars to. For the 9 yrs of observing restaurants it's rare to experience an evening like this. I love eating here and tasting their delicious tapas and sipping on wine. However, it is quite a major disappointment when people at the bar seats become neglected. Only fed free water and never come back to take an order or to check up on them. After waiting for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone, even the host (who isn't doing her job and blabbing with people instead of \"hosting\"), it was a walk-out... an evening of finish the free water, idling wondering wth is going on, and walk out the door with an empty stomach. That's a bummer!!! The other people sitting to the right of the bar seats section had empty dishes around them as if nobody has bothered to swing by to pick them up and ask them for anything else. Don't forget this part of the restaurant... It's the front of the house sitting in front of the chefs, it should get a lot of attention.

Very friendly waiter, gave us some great suggestions and since this is our first time here we decided to do the tapas sampling which cost about 46 per person. \n\nStarted off with the famous oven roasted sardines, very good, goes well with the brad. Then came the arugula salad with goat cheese, I think it was a ok but all my friends loved it. Third course was the croquetas filled with ham and cheese, I think this is a must try dish on menu, very very tasty. Fourth course was the prawns with squid ink rice, another must try on the menu. We all loved it. Fifth course came the roasted asparagus, again I think it was just a okay. Sixth course was the meatball, very rich in flavor and we all loved it. Seventh and final dish was the salmon, it was just a okay. \n\nCame dessert time we ordered the signature chocolate sauce with churros, strawberry sorbet and flan, all very delicious. Great coffee as well. \n\nGreat service, great staff and great atmosphere. We will be back again!", "author": "William C."}

I've been blessed to find awesome authentic tapas spots in the DMV area, so I had some expectations for this Michelin mentioned place. \n\nWhat I ordered: \nThe beet salad - this wasn't too bad. The beets were sweet, but the dressing was too much. \n\nJamon Iberico, Sarr\u00f3 de cabra - I'm partial to goat cheese, but the jamon was more like a jerky - did not expect that. Anyways, what a weird combo right? But I chose them to enjoy separately, not together. And besides, the charcuterie options was lacking. Then again, this is not what I came here for. \n\nTapas -\n1) anchovy gilda - delicious bite. Ugh, I had 2 of these\n2) sardine and avocado toast - another delicious 2-biter. Also had 2 of these. The avocado mellowed out the sardine. That shouldn't have surprised me but it did. \n3) anchovy montadito - this was also very yummy. Both anchovy bites were not at all fishy. Bravo. \n\nPricing- \nThe tapas were decently priced for the taste and quality, I would definitely just go here for these. Maybe it was the company I went with that I felt items were slightly more expensive (by $0.50 for the tapas alone haha). \n\nAtmosphere- \nThey have a well-lit outside seating area in the back with heating lamps. The inside dining area is more dimly lit and can get loud. I think next time I'd sit at the bar.  The service was ok. I wish the servers were more interactive haha. \n\nOverall- this place could definitely be better - have more charcuterie options (get better jamon iberico). Come to experience the tapas.

I chose Contigo and I don't regret any second of it! \n\nI have heard great things about Contigo and was so excited to dine there. However, I was a bit sceptical because being that I've been to Spain and have tried their amazing cuisine, I was worried that this place wouldn't be as \"authentic.\" I'm very happy to say that I was wrong! Every bite that my party and I took kept on getting better and better with every dish that would arrive at our table. \n\nA few things to note: Although I looked on Open table and did not see an available table for 4 for the time that we needed, I was able to call the restaurant and they had a table for us. This happens a lot in SF so don't be afraid to call the restaurant if Open Table isn't giving you a table. Also, I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu. Although it seems as though you will get a large variety of food, it actually made sense to order a few things off the menu and create your own \"tasting menu.\" \n\nFood: You MUST get both of their anchovy tapas. The avocado one is to die for and my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review. The signature tomato toast tapa reminded me of Spain and dining at a small cafe eating this toast while sipping my sangria. The salmon, I would pass on that as it wasn't anything special. I don't eat meat, so I can't vouch for their duck and meatballs, but the rest of my party absolutely loved it. Same goes with the calamari, although I don't eat it (and wish that I did because the dish's presentation was to die for), everyone else at my party said it's their favorite meal! Make sure to leave room for dessert. Their warm churros and chocolate... speechless! \n\nAll in all, this place is a MUST go if you're visiting SF or are an SF local. The service was outstanding, the food was mouth watering and I loved the ambience.

The small plates are meant to be shared, the soft lighting and wood invite relaxation, and our amicable waiter had the easygoing manner of the Spanish. \n\nThere's not much going on in this little stretch of neighborhood other than the neighborhood bar next door. Which unfortunately means there's not much to do while you're waiting (unless you're smart and make a reservation in advance, which I highly recommend if you want an actual table or patio seat!) other than catch a basketball game and play some pool in The Peaks Bar. \n\nStool seats at the sturdy wooden counter opened first, so that's where we two ended up sitting after a 15 minute wait. Not bad considering we came on a whim! Way before our waiter even came I was already hard at work with my iPhone, snapping pictures of EVERYTHING because the whole setup is so picturesque. The stiff linen napkins, blooming red tulips... You can bet when I discovered the outdoor patio and the charming bathroom that I wished I had taken my phone with me on the short journey. The bathroom isn't one of those sterile, polished places - it feels more like a country cottage with its nature-y paint and wooden pallets under the toilet and sink. Contigo is the kind of place where everything has its place, from the decorative mortar and pestle pieces to the defined role of each cook. There's even someone solely dedicated to wiping completed plates clean before setting them out for the waiters (you can tell I took major advantage of the people watching). \n\nOkay, onto the meat of the matter:\n- Croquetas: we chose two crispy Jam\u00f3n Serrano croquetas that immediately jump-started our meal. It's pricy, at $3.50 for one meatball sized croquette, but the creamy-crispy combo is something you really need to try. If ham is not your thing, get a different filling! \n- Papas Braves: no bravery necessary for this saucy dish! Jokes and poor pronunciation aside, these are a Spanish favorite (also called papas bravas). Crispy-skinned potatoes for dipping in both aioli and tangy tomato salsa brava. Think  homefries, but better.\n- Tripe with Chorizo and Chickpeas: I didn't know what to expect, even after seeing it in front of me. But the sauce is a party on your tongue. The tripe makes for an interesting slippery texture (like glass noodles) and you never really know what you've scooped out of the stew until it's in your mouth.\n- Sauteed Greens Catalan style: this is not the way to go if you want bang for your buck. The greens seemed to be large leaves of spinach (or a relative) topped with pine nuts and raisins, with flavor assistance from garlic and lemon. Nothing special, would probably order a salad to get my greens next time.\n- Albondigas: these are also supposedly another Spanish classic, but the gaminess of the lamb was very much present. Texture-wise, I loved how crumbly yet juicy they were, but I think this could have been better.\n\nThe dishes here can be hit or miss, and I think as long as you like the ingredients going into the dish, you're safe. It's up to you to take the $12 bite-sized chance. After seeing the check I think Contigo is worth checking out once or twice for the ambiance, but I'll have to see some menu revamp before coming back.", "author": "Helen S."}

I've been to all. Where they good? YES. \"Best\" in SF? HELL NO. All were overpriced and none were authentic nor mom & pop owned. IMO, ethnic food should be cheap (especially Asian and Mexican) and natives should be present in the restaurant.\n\nContigo has been on my mental list for a while and when 7x7 named them as \"Best Spanish\" it peaked my interest even more for some odd reason. Even though 7x7 has failed me countless times, what does this Asian girl know about Spanish food?

The duck breast was rendered just enough leaving the skin super crisp and the meat (medium rare) succulently tender.

My dinner companion (who is not easily impressed) was also a fan of everything we ordered. \n\nAnd just in case I wasn't clear, let me impress upon you for the umpteenth time the deliciousness that was the super thick TCHO hot chocolate with churros.

Definitely a place I need to try. \n\nCame here on a Wednesday night with a friend without a reservation and we were seated immediately. We had a bit of a hard time deciphering the menu because it was in Spanish, but we still managed to order some food. \n\nWe ordered the sardine and avocado toast, the croquetas, the squid dish, the crispy potatoes, and churros with TCHO chocolate for dessert. Also, strawberry sangria for me, and a glass of ros\u00e9 for my friend. \n\nThe sardine and avocado toast was good. And as much as I enjoy seafood, it was still a little fishy for my taste. But sardines, so I guess I can't complain. \n\nThe croquetas were okay. Crispy on the outside, warm and cheesy on the inside.\n\nThe squid dish was pretty good. The squid was super tender and not chewy at all. However, it was on a bed of some sort of grain, but it was too spicy for my friend and I to enjoy. \n\nI was a little disappointed with the crispy potatoes. They were crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. They were perfect! Except there were two different sauces on top of them, which I thought took away from the flavor of the potatoes, instead of enhancing it. I would have been much happier if the potatoes were served with a side of ranch, but I guess that would make the dish more American than Spanish. \n\nThe churros with the chocolate dipping sauce was my favorite dish. The chocolate was very rich without being too sweet. They dust the churros with sea salt, which brought out the flavor of the chocolate even more. However, my friend thought the churros were a little too salty. :(\n\nThe strawberry sangria was really pretty to look at, but it only had a hint of strawberry to it. I was expecting more of a strawberry flavor for how thick it seemed. \n\nDecent food for a steep price. Probably will not come back. :(", "author": "Vivian L."}

Believe me when I say they are all worth it. I could eat these all day. The croquetas taste very authentic and the cojonudos really are \"amazeballs.\" Not to mention they're really cute. \n\nFrom the raciones we ordered the tripe with chickpeas, mussels, and albondigas. The tripe was super flavorful, so if you like tripe/stew, try this! The mussels had good flavor, but were definitely not as fresh as I would have liked. The albondigas were good too, but I don't see why everyone seems to think they are amazing.\n\nThe table next to us ordered the lamb rib chops. I wish we had ordered this instead!

Everything at Contigo had great execution, but after my dining experience at Coqueta, I realized Contigo was just OK (food-wise).\n\nMy friends and I came here on a Sunday night as part of our monthly food outing. Parking was actually not too bad, surprisingly. We were seated in the outdoor patio with the heated lamps. However, the heated lamps got pretty hot because it was heating our backs the whole time... Anyways, the four of us decided to share family style so we could try a little bit of everything. \n\nWood Oven Roasted Local Sardine and Avocado Toast: Really liked the texture of the toast as it added a crunch with the sardine. \n\nCoca (Flatbread) of Wild Nettles: I really liked this dish because it wasn't too cheesy nor too oily/greasy. I really liked how the crust was crispy. Felt pretty healthy just eating that.\n\nPatates Braves: I thought this dish was just OK. The potatoes were crispy and fried. However, there was a very good portion of potatoes.\n\nCharred Asparagus: Pretty interesting since it was served with egg and ham. But overall, the taste was just OK. Nothing too special.\n\nSeared Local Black Cod: One of my favorite dishes of the night. The black cod was soft and moist. \n\nMonterey Xipirons (squid) a la Planxa: Squid was pretty chewy and wasn't overcooked. I liked how it was presented over squid ink rice and chorizo. One of my other favorite dishes of the night\n\nAlbondigas: Contained pork and lamb in tomato sauce. I wasn't too big of a fan of the albondigas here.. Didn't really like the taste nor the texture.\n\nTCHO Hot Chocolate with Churros: Churros were the perfect portion size for dessert. The TCHO hot chocolate was really rich and chocolately, but complemented the churros well. However, after having almost the same dessert at Coqueta, I definitely prefer Coqueta's version of the churros with hot chocolate and mixed berries powder.", "author": "Philana C."}

I'm kind of sad having to write this review! Service as always was great for the most part (our main server was kind but seemed very disinterested in us, but that could just be a bad day! But the other servers and hostess were so helpful and friendly) and they even accommodated our friend who has a severe seafood allergy and needs to ensure meat and seafood are prepared on different grills/pans. They were great about that.\n\nHighlights: the pear and jamon salad and the tomato/olive oil/sea salt crusty bread (can't remember the name!) and the lamb rib chops. And the Mexican hot chocolate with churros dessert was half good (see below) as the hot chocolate was dark, rich, creamy and amazing! The croquetas were nice.\n\nDownsides: the dishes came out randomly  and we waited a long time for the lamb at the end and for our dessert. There was no \"flow\" to the pacing of the meal. The delicata squash salad recommended by our server was delicious but only had about 3 small bits of squash in the entire salad. It could use more.  We had a chorizo flatbread type dish that was \"meh\" so we didn't eat most of it (they kindly took this off our bill without us asking them to since they saw we didn't like it, so that was very classy and kind!) The patatas bravas tasted burnt. The albondigas were good but honestly I remember being blown away by them before so I was kind of sad! And the fried eggplant was so bland, I had to ask for salt which I never do. The Churro and hot chocolate dessert was half good (see above) but the churros were overcooked.\n\nThis was really disappointing as we've had amazing meals here but food quality seems to have slipped.

Despite the cozy cava name,, the answer is definitely NO.  Chairs, tables not comfortable, but most importantly one dish after another was bland, uninteresting, flavorless. Avoid the \"white gaspacho.\"  Oily, flavorless, supposedly with hazelnuts but maybe 2 at most. The croqueta was good- but was so small, we thought it a joke. I know this was a 'tapas' course, but really, less than one bite. Spinach and chick pea stew had no flavor except burned spinach.  Needed spices desperately  And it was $15 for a shallow dish!  The exotic sounding cana de cabra goat cheese has a flavorful thin slice of goat cheese, but really! $16 for a thin slab over some undressed arugula, not worth it. Albondigas consisted of 3 ample meatballs that despite the 3 meat description had less flavor than canned meatballs and was $13.

Asian's dim sum kind of where you order these small dishes to try, except this is the Spanish edition. \n\nIt was a cloudy Friday evening. We walked in and I was blown away by the decors. The lights were dimly lit, but dim enough that you can see everything clearly. There was a brick oven, which I never saw in person before. Everything on display looked mouth watering.

The food was sensational, the wine bottles were tantalizing, the dessert was enticing, the ambiance was intimate and the service was outstanding. \n\nContigo boasts a modern, intimate and cozy vibe that makes it the ideal spot for date nights and chummy dinners. The location right off 24th street in charming Noe Valley doesn't hurt either. \n\nYou simply have to order the chef's tasting menu of 7 courses for $42. It's such a freaking steal and you get the satisfaction of trying all the highlights on the menu. \n\nHere were our 7 courses: \n1. Ham croqueta: cheesy and crispy fried deliciousness. One of the better croquetas I've had in tapas restaurants.\n2. Sardine and avocado toast with pickled onions and smoked salt: Although I was a bit hesitant about sardines, this was quite possibly my favorite of the night. It was literally bursting with flavor at every bite and the texture combination of the soft avocados on top of the smooth sardine on top of the crispy toast... dear god. \n3. Arros negre (squid ink rice with squid): This was the unanimous table favorite as the squid was so plump and oozing with flavor and the rice was perfectly soaked in yummy squid ink. I'd say this was a close second to the sardine and avocado toast for me. \n4. Pork and lamb meatballs in tomato sauce: So well cooked, meaty and tender.\n5. A salad dish that I can't remember: Nothing noteworthy to write home about. It was just a salad.\n6. Patates braves: So crispy and fried to perfection. One of the best patates braves I've had!\n7. Brussel sprouts with jamon serrano, parsnip, capers and cava butter: So freaking flavorful and yummy! I could eat them all day in the wonderful sauce that the sprouts were covered in.\n8. Trout wrapped with prosciutto: The flavor profile of the fatty prosciutto piece seeping onto the perfectly seared trout with the special sauce on top... I can't even...\n\nAll in all, we were beyond impressed with the intricate detail that went into each course. Clearly, the highlights are the unique flavor profiles and intermingling of ingredients. I highly recommend ordering the chef's tasting menu to get the full vision of the chef and soak in all that Contigo has to offer. \n\nSo on your next yearning for some delicious Spanish food, give Contigo a try - you won't be disappointed! \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Every single dish was delicious, the ambiance was beautiful, and the service was excellent! Came here with a close friend and shared about 7 tapas. We left STUFFED........ but satisfied :)\n\nTo start we started with individual mini tapas:\n\nOxtail Mini Hamburguesa ($5) - I've never had oxtail meat before but was pleasantly surprised! Braised oxtail meat just melts in your mouth! The meat was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor! But just a warning - you get one tiny hamburger that you can literally fit in one bite!\n\nCreamy Dungeness Crab Croqueta ($5) - delicious ball of crab meat, breaded and fried to perfection. The outside breading was crunchy and topped with a spicy sauce which complimented the creamy crab!\n\nWood Oven Roasted Local Sardine and Avocado Toast ($3) - a delicious fishy dish! Avoid if you can't stand fishy flavors! But the creamy avocado spread and smokey flavor evens out the sardine.\n\nNext came the bigger dishes called Raciones - plates for sharing:\n\nLittle gem salad ($11) - talk about fresh ingredients! Some of the most delicious and flavorful beets I've never had! Topped with flavor bombs = GARLIC CHIPS! Yum! The sherry mustard vinaigrette is a bit overpowering - so avoid if you like  sour flavors! \n\nPatates Braves ($8) - gotta have some carbs! A dish of crispy fried potatoes topped with a spicy salsa brava sauce. Generous portions - we couldn't finish this one!\n\nLocal calamars a la planxa ($11) - grilled calamari served on a bed of brussel sprouts kept piping hot on a steel plate. The salty calamari and capers paired perfectly with the hints of sweetness from the currants. Definitely would recommend this dish! \n\nSeared Hawaiian Ahi Tuna ($22) - by far my favorite dish of the night! 4 pieces of seared ahi tuna placed on top of a creamy celery root. The tuna was topped with broccoli and a oxtail broth was poured tableside. The tuna was seasoned delicately so that you could still enjoy the freshness of the fish but the seared skin was salty. For some reason me and my friend kept tasting something slightly sweet also, but couldn't put our finger on it. Either way - it blew us away! We licked the plate clean!\n\nOverall, I had a wonderful dining experience.

The flavors were not what I expected on a few of the dishes.\n\nWe didn't appreciate walking in and then being led outside again to their \"outdoor\" dining area. It was a tad chilly tonight.  We walked past a few open tables on the inside of the restaurant and asked if we could have one of those instead.  They graciously agreed.  (They must try to unload the outdoor seating first.)\n\nWe squeezed into a tiny table for two after being bumped by the waitstaff a few times.  The staff was great though and very inviting--no problems there at all.  The space itself is pleasing and cozy.\n\nThe oxtail sliders that we ordered first were very greasy and contained a large chunk of bone.  After pointing it  out to the server, she quickly took it off our bill--that was nice of her considering we didn't ask or expect anything.  The tiny sliders are $5.00 each!\n\nThe meatballs made with pork and lamb and served in a tomato, sherry sauce were just ok.  It tasted like the meatballs were sitting in a warm applesauce. I had to get over that thought as I ate....\n\nThe brussel sprouts were over seasoned and served with hazelnuts, capers, mint and lime.  It didn't work for me.\n\nThe pork that we also ordered was the best choice of the evening but for $27.00 --it was not worth it!    There were just 4 tiny pieces of pork sliced on the bias.  This came with a sprinkling of broccoli rabe and a couple of sliced fingerling potatoes. \n\nThe crab salad was just ok too.  Too much endive and other unseasoned greens on a small plate.\n\nThe worst dish were the churros--they were over cooked and hard.  Tasteless too.  They were $4.00 and we also ordered the melted Tcho chocolate sauce for another $5.00.\nWe dipped the churros into the melted sauce but that still didn't help.\n\nBottom line--I didn't like the food.

All four of the people I have brought here have liked it as well.  \n\nI am so glad to have a favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.  The back patio is nice, even during a rain storm, and is a bit quieter than the inside.  \n\nI don't eat many veggies, but the vegetable dishes here are fantastic, especially the spinach and chickpea dish.  I don't like salads, but the two I have had here won me over.  I have not tried the paella yet.  It is only offered on Tuesdays and although I have been there twice on a Tuesday, I did not want to wait 40 minutes for it.  \n\nThe menu changes a bit each week.

The place was pretty quiet as there were only a few tables filled, but quickly filled as we ate.\n\nNot knowing what to get, we decided to go for the tasting menu (a selection of 7 dishes served family style). Our tasting menu for that night consisted of:\n\nSpanish Olives, Marcona Almonds, and Pickled Farmers Vegetables (not on tasting menu)\n- High quality products and a good little snack while waiting for the other dishes to come out (I'm a sucker for Marcona almonds and pickled veggies).\n\nSardine on Toast\n- One of my favorites of the night. Simple dish, but really tasty.\n\nOxtail Mini-Hamburguesa\n- Surprisingly good. The hamburger patty consisting of oxtail complete with the chewy bits for lots of flavor!\n\nLittle Gem Salad\n- Yum. Beets and garlic chips!\n\nSpinach and Chickpeas Andalusian Style\n- Pretty solid dish. Great mix of spices.\n\nLocal Xipirons\n- Good dish with fresh squid, Padr\u00f3n peppers, and tomatoes.\n\nLocal King Salmon\n- Baked beautifully in/on fig leafs which helped it remain very moist and juicy. The corn, zucchini, cherry tomato medley underneath was really good.\n\nAlb\u00f3ndigas\n- Good quality meatball with some depth in flavor. But to be honest, it wasn't mindblowing or anything. Slightly more developed than what you would expect a meatball in tomato sauce to taste like.\n\nParking isn't too bad in the area. We were able to easily find parking just down the block. Service was good and our waiter did a great job. He was very friendly and helpful. Also there's a nice covered patio area in the back that looked like it would be nice to sit at for those warm summer nights.\n\nWe'll be back to try some of the other dishes!", "author": "Vivian L."}

We ran a search on Yelp and decided to go with Contigo. \n\nIt was fairly straight-forward to make a reservation for a Sunday on Open Table. We like the neighborhood the restaurant is in, a lot of stores and boutiques. Good to walk around before or after a meal if the stores aren't closed yet. \n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, we were instantly attracted to the bar/kitchen area and the lights on the left hand side. The ambience was dark but earthy and warm. \n\nWe were led to the back of the restaurant, which was an enclosed semi-outdoor area with heaters around us, so it wasn't cold at all sitting \"out\". We were surrounded by plants and some fire woods, which provides a homey and outdoorsy feel to it. \n\nWe ordered 7-8 tapas, everything was decently good. All the recommended tapas by the waitress turned out to be delicious. One thing we really wanted to try was Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, as the ones we had in Spain were just mind-blowing. The one in Contigo turned out to be satisfying. Moreover, the cava the waitress recommended was pretty tasty as well. \n\nWe were happy with our food and the service.

I came in  a group of 8 for a birthday dinner, and we all thought the food was great and the wine was amazing.   \n\nIf you have a party of 8 or more, you are automatically required to have their prix fixe menu of $42/person (which ended up being $73/person pre-tip by the time we added wine, dessert and tax).  My one complaint about this is that they don't actually tell you in advance what that menu is going to be, and it changes regularly, plus it doesn't include paella (apparently Tuesdays are paella nights).  Luckily, they are super accommodating about allergies, and they sent out different dishes where necessary for my friends who were on gluten-free diets. \n\nWe were seated in the back patio area with heat lamps, and it was really nice back there!  \n\nThe menu was excellent.  A good variety of food and some standouts:\nSardine and avocado toast with pickled onion and sea salt - a sardine dish will never be a favorite of mine but surprisingly this was actually pretty good even for people who aren't in to sardines. \nCroqueta de jamon serrano - nicely done \nMelon con Jamon - yummy!  Always a good pairing but the melon wasn't too mushy and the parma ham tasted so good. \nCojondongo - a gazpacho salad  - this was delicious!  Really fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, fris\u00e9e, some crispy stuff that added texture, grapes for some added sweetness, and a light vinaigrette.  \nSquid a la plancha with shelling beans, padron peppers, chorizo - really nicely cooked. Loved the peppers and aioli. \nBlack cod - slightly crisped skin and super moist fish - excellent! \nAlbondigas (pork lamb and jamon meatballs) in tomato sherry sauce - never a fan of meatballs so I'm not the best judge, but the sauce was tasty.  \n\nOur server recommended 2012 Bodegas y Vi\u00f1edos Ponce \"PF\" Manchuela which was an awesome big red, and luckily the cheapest one on the menu too! ($50/bottle).  Everyone loved it and we ended up finishing off a few.  \n\nFor dessert, we got the flan but more importantly the TCHO chocolate with churros.  Delicious!   After finishing the churro, I couldn't stop drinking the chocolate, which has added sea salt.  \n\nIn general, I found the service very friendly throughout the booking process when I had to call back several times to add people to the reservation.   I would say the service during the meal seemed super slow, and it ended up taking nearly 3 hours, which wasn't ideal on a school night.  I'm not sure if it's partly because we were outside in the back.  The restaurant was hopping throughout the evening though.  \n\nIn any case, we loved our evening and I am looking forward to trying paella night!   Well done!", "author": "Vivian W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-20", "description": "Out of all the restaurants I tried either by walking, trolleys, and/or buses, this is the one place I would happily sit on a train and bus, then have to walk a bit.  This was as good as it gets.  It was recommended by a friend and I'm so glad we went.  It has a wonderful atmosphere, but it comes down to the food, right?\n\nWell, it receives five stars, so you can guess I enjoyed the food. Dish after dish was spectacular. Unfortunately I don't remember the actual names of each dish, sorry, but I'll do my best to describe them.  After all, we had nine dishes while we were there. Maybe someone who works there will stumble upon this and tell me the actual names.\n\nOur first tapas was mangos with cheese. It truly was a great way to start. It was fresh, ripe, wonderful combination of the fruit and cheese. (4.5 Stars)\n\nWe moved onto toast with tomato bruschetta.  The toast was wonderfully crunchy despite the tomato spread on it. This was probably the least favorite of all the dishes, not a home run, but a double or triple. (3 Stars)\n\nI was the only one who wanted to try the monidito (sardines), which worked out well, all three for me. I was expecting a very salty piece of fish, but it was prepared in a way where it wasn't and the toast underneath helped to make the whole bite very mild. (4 Stars)\n\nNext on our palate was the albondigas (meatballs). It is pork meat balls in a tomato sherry sauce. OUT OF THE PARK HOMERUN! Wow, was this one out of two favorite dishes that night. After the meatballs were done, I was still scrapping the tomato sauce.  It was slightly spicy, just enough heat, making you want more. (6 out of 5 Stars)\n\nThe second favorite dish was the brussels sprouts. Up until this evening, I never ate brussels sprouts. This dish made me do an about-face for brussels sprouts. I now say I eat them. I feel like they blanched them before cooking them because they were cooked, yet still deliciously crunchy. It also had a lemon dressing that made you lick your lips and hoping there were some sauce on them. As a surprise, there was a layer of thinly sliced almonds underneath giving it just an additional flavor, but the right amount of texture. (5 Stars)\n\nI didn't see this one on the menu today, but if it's not, what a loss.  The next one was Pimientos de Padron (small peppers sauteed and sprinkled with sea salt). These were yummy and zero were left. I was expecting them to be spicy, but were not. They had just enough charred flavor that was complimented with the salt. (4 Stars)\n\nThe crispy potatoes arrived with a tomato dressing.  I think I would have enjoyed these more if it wasn't next to my favorite ones.  Since it was competing side-by-side, it fell to waste side. We finished them, don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but couldn't compete with the brussels sprouts and meat balls. (3 Stars)\n\nMoving onto dessert, we tried two. The first one was an ice cream dish, but I don't remember what type, once again competing side-by-side with a better dish. (3 Stars)\n\nThe dessert that left us wanting more was the chocolate caliente con churros.  These were delicious Mexican cinnamon sticks that we could dip into hot molten chocolate. Once the sticks were gone, we were using our spoons to dig out the chocolate. Yummy! (4.5 Stars)", "author": "Randy G."}

Located in Noe Valley this place can easily be passed up.  The small sign waves steadily outside amongst the heavy foot traffic.  Once you step inside you'll be transported into a chic dining destination with outside patio seating as well for those bright sunny days.\n\nThe tapas style menu is hard to believe with almost everything on the menu looking delectable.  Our modest party of three started off with some anchovy tapas and a couple of bottles of wine to get the festivities rolling.  The selection is pretty large for such a small space and the staff was extremely courteous and knowledgeable about the meal at hand. the ablondigas were a great way to prep for the race with simple flavors that packed a tiny little punch. The little gem and seared cheese salads were the cleansing needed after a heavy little ball, followed up by the King Salmon  being the highlight of the night. Of course we couldn't leave without trying the dessert.  The vanilla ice cream with olive oil and sea salt was the sweet-tooth's winner.\n\nI would gladly try Contigo again, and again.... and again if only someone would take me out for once :)", "author": "Kevin J."}

There were 4 empty tables and we were walked to the table and then walked back because they wanted to make sure the people who had reservations at 7:45PM would be sat on time even though they weren't there yet. So we waited as those tables trickled in and then at 8:05PM we were seated.... at the table we were walked to in the first place. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on coming, but don't show up early unless you're okay eating at 8:45PM or 9PM because it really cleared out. \nWe did the 7 course tasting menu and 2 sangrias and a bottle of white to start. The first two courses were from the Tapas menu; Croquetas and the Sardine/ Avocado Toast. The croqueta was okay but a bit mushy inside while the Sardine toast was delightful and I believe the first time I had Sardines.\nNext was the Condonjongo or Gazpacho  salad which was tasty but super overdressed. \nNow it was here, after 3 courses that the waitress came back and told us the wine we ordered wasn't in stock. Meanwhile our very small Sangrias had been drained eons ago. So we ordered a different bottle.\nThen came the Ham and Peaches dish which was odd, though the peaches were very tasty. \nThen we finally got our wine. \nNext was the Squid, Salmon, and Meatballs. The squid dish was tasty but mostly because of the tomatoes as the squid itself was very lightly flavored. The salmon with roasted corn was an awesome dish. The meatballs had a weird texture and felt apart on the plate.\nWe ordered the churros and tcho chocolate for dessert which was delish.\nMy biggest issue wasn't the bland food or the sadist host but the weird firing of the dishes. We would get two at a time sometimes and then one right after and then sit with an empty dish in front of us for 15 minutes before we got the next dish. Also, considering how saucy everything was, we had to ask to have our plates switched out with clean ones.

I love avocado so there's no issues there, but was also sardines which I didn't think I would like, but it added a great salty presence to it. \nStrawberry goat cheese salad - very fresh and the goat cheese was really good even though for the most part I don't like goat cheese.\nAsparagus - I would have a preferred a poached egg, but that's because I preferred poached eggs to fried eggs with a great sauce. \nHalibut - so well cooked. Still so moist and I remembered this great sauce of carrots I think. I love a well cooked fish.\nSquid - I remember this dish just being okay.

I had tasting menu, first course was avocado spread on toast, very good. second course was a croquette filled with creamed beef? normally that would have been revolting, but nice texture and taste. Next was asparagus with an egg. This egg was fake poached, steamed so a little bit of a crust. Normally I dislike this technique for eggs, but this did not have the nasty taste just an unpleasant texture. Next was a crab salad, and a poached whitefish with lentils. nice chimichurri  sauce and mint on fish. waiter described fish as lamb.. but was excellent. crab salad was amazing had orange slices which added the perfect amount of acid. my next was squid on a bed of small pasta, like Israeli couscous in squid ink covered with yogurt.  Squid was perfect, pasta was a little over cooked and yogurt had no flavor and slimy texture, definitely should have stayed far away. Finally, a meatball, with middle eastern spices. meatball was perfect, sauce needed more time to build flavor. I ended with a cheese course and that was perfect. \n\nSome small, very minor, missteps, but an amazing meal and their decor is a delight. \n\nNoise is low, not a church, but not the middle of the road either. \n\nI will be back.", "author": "Dean N."}

I came here for dinner with my mom and boyfriend and we were not disappointed! \n\nFirst we ordered the anchovies, the sardines, and the croquettes. The anchovies were my mom and my favorite as they were the perfect mix of salty and savory. My bf liked the croquettes the best. The sardines were a bit too large for my taste. It was overwhelming and not as complimentary to the dish as I though the anchovies were. \n\nThen we ordered the mint/beet salad, fried quail, meatballs, and beef tenderloin. YUM!!!! All three were delicious. The beef was my favorite as it came with blue cheese and green beans. Both were cooked perfectly. The quail was also super impressive to me. You could clearly taste the quail even though it was breaded and fried. The salad that went with it was also tasty. The mint/beet salad was extremely refreshing and the perfect complement to the the beef and quail. The meatballs were very good and tender, but nothing unique. The other dishes were much more impressive. All the food was delicious though and you could taste how fresh the ingredients are. \n\nOh, and the bread the have there is amazing! I don't know if they make it there or buy it, but it is the best crusty bread I have had in a long time! \n\nOverall this place is definitely worth going to. The ambiance is great and I like the set up of the restaurant. The bar area is pretty neat because you get to watch them actually cook the meal. I really enjoyed that. The staff seemed nice but our server was not that attentive, although they were at capacity that night so maybe that was it. \n\nThe only negative is how expensive it is compared to the portion size.

Cute space.\n\nThe bad:  horrendous service at times.  Servers seem oblivious and even condescending to our questions & requests.  The last 5 times we went, service was terrible for all 5.  Also, please try and space out the timing for prix fixe courses.  The simplest rule is never to bring another dish out when guests are still working on the previous one.  That's not too much to ask right?\n\nI and my friends have been coming to Contigo since it opened in 2009 (we even followed Brett Emerson's Flickr before he started building the restaurant).  It's one of my go-to places in The City and I always take out-of-town visitors there, as well as birthdays and other celebrations.

The seasonal menu always has intriguing dishes, though the Chef's Menu provides the best value and offers a diverse sampling of the menu's top selections.  I recommend the grilled seafood (squid a la plancha) and meat (lamb rib chops) dishes, in addition to the iberico ham, albondigas and anything off their tapas menu.  Their by-the-glass sherry selection is also quite good, which I also recommend.

It was essentially a four course meal that started with a trio of teeny-tiny appetizers, a salad, a main, and then dessert. The food ranged from remarkable (a two-bite grilled cheese sandwich with jamon iberico and black truffle) to super-good (a choice of short ribs braised in sherry or a very well executed seafood paella). At $65 per person, the sum total of all the portions was relatively generous, and I didn't feel we were being saddled with the old Valentine's Day prix fixe flim-flam -- i.e., a deal that looks good on the paper menu, but is really just a profit-making vehicle for the restaurant. \n\nService was fine but not great. Our waiter was prompt and attentive, but also low energy (almost solemn) and inaudible when he spoke. I would have liked to have been reminded a bit more about what we were eating. \n\nAll in all, it was generally a great meal.  Except for the $40 wine pairing menu.\n\nThe wine itself was fantastic, especially the xarel.lo white and the special reserve madeira. But the wines always significantly preceded the courses, and the pours were just silly small. This made actually *pairing* the wine and food almost impossible. The wine was almost gone by the time the food arrived. If I go back, I'll be interested to see if their by-the-glass pours are so stingy.", "author": "Jon P."}

Then we sat and waited... and waited... for our last dish, the Pluma. It was good, but not worth the 30 minute additional wait, and honestly, not worth the $36. Wasn't that impressed with the Xipirons a la Planxa (squid) and Mushroom Flatbread... our table didn't finish those dishes. \n\nOur waiter was very absent throughout the meal, he seemed to spend a lot of time in the back. Actually not sure where he was, but he wasn't at our table. Additionally, the wait staff took away my friend's wine glass for some reason (even though we hadn't finished the wine we were sharing), and we had to ask 3 times for them to replace it. The 2nd time we asked, a waitress brought a wine menu because she thought we were asking to order another glass. Additionally, they took away my wine glass, even though there was still some wine left in it, without even consulting me first. It was almost comedic how bad and rude the service was.\n\nAt the end of our unintentional 1.5 hour meal, our waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.

I arrived at 9:20pm. \n\nHighlights of our experience:\n\nOur attempt to make eye contact with hostess upon arrival was hilarious. I've never been so unsuccessful at locking eyes with another human being. It was as if the hostess was actively averting my eyes. If i didn't know better, I'd say that the restaurant was hoping that we'd go away.\n\nOur waitress was exceedingly awkward and unwilling to engage in dialog once she realized that we're going to only order 4 dishes total to share, and pass on the wine. She did of course recommend highly the most expensive items on the menu. \n\nIt wasn't a particularly busy evening, but Contigo did manage to take 60 minutes in delivering 4 tapas dishes (one of which is an appetizer). The last dishes that managed to come out was missing an extra meatball, so that took another 10 minutes. \n\n(we were pretty envious of the table next to us, a party of 5 girls who had great service... perhaps we should have ordered wine just to get treated as actual customers instead of sad hanger-ons.)\n\nOur professed enthusiasm for a dessert menu went ignored. I guess it's okay since 55 minutes into the limp service, any trace of desire for dessert had died. \n\nOur waitress asked us about 60 minutes into the meal if we're enjoying the food. I don't know what she had expected as an answer, since she was surprised when I told her the truth: our order got lost, then came out slowly, and in separate parts. Our plea for a dessert menu meant nothing. She looked offended but assured that she has told management about the evening's shortcoming.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the service and pacing of the meal were terribly wrong. To begin, we were seated 20 minutes late after being reassured no less than 5 times that our table would be ready shortly. Then, throughout the night, we had 4 servers, all of whom were nice, but none of whom had the information from our previous server. \n\nOne standout highlight of the evening came when a new server asked to see the ID of my 24 year old cousin who had asked for wine. After telling her that she left her ID at home, my 23 year old brother said, \"she's older than I am.\" He had already been provided wine (and was not carded, unbeknownst to the new server). The server then didn't check my brother's ID, and passed it off as a joke, which was kind of sexist of them to do--carding her just because she's a girl. She told us the manager could help us, but the real problem with this restaurant was the fact that 4 servers helped us throughout the night. \n\nIt was particularly rude to see our first server eating dinner in the dining room while we were waiting for our many courses that were taking forever to come out of the kitchen as well. We got three dishes and then waited 45 minutes for the next one to show up. Overall, the service was just appalling.\n\nThe food was good, we all thought. We ordered around 10 different items on the menu. We liked the pork croquetas, the alb\u00f3ndigas, and the brussel sprouts. It's a shame that the service was so terrible (not that the servers were particularly bad at being servers, but it just seemed like there was really bad management or that they had overbooked or something that night). That left our table feeling ignored and wondering what was going on.\n\nAnyway, I won't be going back because dropping $600 on dinner that leaves a sour taste in everyone's mouth just isn't worth it.", "author": "Graham H."}

So much attention to detail with each dish. Each plate had its own special flavor accents, the order and timing of everything was spot on. We added the papas bravas , which I highly recommend, don't miss them if you're a fan of this traditional dish. Dessert was the almond cake and the hot chocolate with churros. Yum yum yum yum. \n\nEqually lovely was the service. Prompt and pleasant. I'm pregnant, so of course I have food restrictions. The servers and kitchen were highly accommodating and happily determined which cheeses were pasteurized and which were not (pasteurized blue cheese?! There is a god!!) They swapped my lamb (which I preferred to forgo because of it can't be medium rare why bother) with a small plate of something equally delightful. \n\nThank you Contigo for a magical meal and experience I will not soon forget.

The sausage and monchego cheese pizza was the best dish we ordered, perfect crust and flavorful. I felt the Brussels Sprout Leaves and the Pork/Lamb meatballs were just alright. The Churros were very tasty, especially with the melted chocolate. Considering this restaurant is Tapas style, I felt the dishes were very reasonably sized. \n\nI felt the ambiance was lacking anything really special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-07", "description": "I was very happy to come here for their grand opening on Tuesday. The pictures previously posted do a better job of depicting the modern decor, so I won't bother to discuss that. The open kitchen lets you have a view of the food preparation and many of the fresh ingredients, which is very cool. It was a busy night, by the time I left there was a line of people waiting for an open table.\n\nThe tapas (hot/cold) are $8 each or 3 for $21. Charcuterie is priced at $9 each or 3 for $24 (the \"Jamon Iberico de Bellota\" has a $22 supplement cost - Wow! $31 (9+22) for just a few slices of aged ham, I thought). \"Bellota\" means acorn, so that means ham from acorn fed pigs. Nobody at the table was brave enough to order that. Later I was told that the ham (aka. \"pata negra\") sells for $90 a pound at Bi-Rite market.\n\nAs expected the wait staff was a bit nervous on their first day. The waitresses try to be very friendly and pleasant, but there were a few long waits. At first waiting for someone to take my order, and later she had to check if the kitchen had brewed any cranberry iced tea which was listed on the drinks menu. Much later another waitress was thoughtful enough to bring some bread and olive oil - I used it with the anchovies dish.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c5Pog3vEqmBFOBdL7R3vAg?select=OS1eQ0w8JCBEFK0O3msdLQ\n\nThe first tapas dish I tried was the fillets of anchovies. These are canned anchovies, which are salty, so not everyone will like this dish. The fillets are swimming in olive oil, so some of the saltiness is diluted. This simple presentation was a bit disappointing. Would u pay $8 for someone to open a tin can and place a small portion of the contents on a plate, then add olive oil? It would have been a much more interesting dish if they had paired them with red peppers or artichoke hearts, or with olives & cheese over toast, or with chopped tomatoes & egg over toast, like some preparations at bars in spain. Fresh anchovies (Boquerones) would have been a real treat. Sadly, those images were in my head and not on the plate.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c5Pog3vEqmBFOBdL7R3vAg?select=az1xY3irrp9Ogr8F27thJQ\n\nSetas a la plancha, was a very simple dish. Grilled wild mushrooms topped by parsley. Tasty, no complaints.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c5Pog3vEqmBFOBdL7R3vAg?select=lJfp-XTJRt27orjllpkg9A\n\nSopa de ajo tierno, chicken soup with green garlic, farm egg. \"ajo tierno\" = young/tender garlic aka. green garlic. I read the dish name in Spanish, so I knew there was no chicken. Customers who read the English part perhaps got confused, \"chicken broth\" would've been a better description. The soup is served in a shallow bowl, my spoon hit the bottom every time. It would have been easier to eat from a cup. There's a tasty poached egg in the middle and lots of chopped chorizo (item not listed on menu), but not much green garlic (I did see a few slivers of what looked like green onions, which is what green garlic looks like). So the description didn't match and I dislike shallow bowls. But the soup itself was delicious!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c5Pog3vEqmBFOBdL7R3vAg?select=clW6k6VifY-L-sz0EcBquQ\n\nI was too busy chatting about the bad economy, food trends and SF restaurants, that I just forgot to take any more pics.\n\nTrucha a la Navarra - steelhead trout (tastes like salmon) is served with tender asparagus and marinated onions (resembled the pink ginger you get at sushi places). The fish was perfectly cooked, tender & moist, and it had a thin layer \"skin\" of crispy Jamon Serrano on one side. I've had a similar dish in other places (salmon with bacon) using applewood smoked bacon instead (the flavor contrast is better). I liked the dish, but it didn't wow me.\n\nThe pork belly with ears, feet, & butter beans was a favorite of another person, but I didn't get to taste it.\n\nI was full already, so I didn't order any dessert. But I got to taste someone's blood orange tart with olive oil ice cream, it was very good. Topped with whole blood orange slices. Yummy!\n\nOverall, I saw that the kitchen kept their cool during the rush of orders, and the wait staff did okay for a first day. I expect that the place will be a favorite of many, as they figure out what works or not.", "author": "Luis C."}

I have dined here on several occasions, my favorite being a warm sunny day sitting in their outdoor area nestled amongst their heirloom tomato vines.\n\nThe Spanish style tapas plates are great for sharing.  The small plates are fairly priced, and just large enough to give a few great bites to each in a group of 3-4.  They have delicious croquettes- $3-$5 a piece I believe (approx), and they are wonderful.  Jamon is always a hit for me as well.  On my most recent visit we had a delicious white sea bass large plate- excellent!  We also enjoyed their meatballs very much, and a baked, bubbling fava bean dish which vaguely reminded me of cassoulet.  Wine was reasonably priced (heavy on Spanish selections of course), and I also enjoyed their house-made blood orange soda!\n\nContigo is a relaxing escape- and always a mini-odyssey of food- regardless of the size of my dining group (2 or more), I always seem to have about 5-7 different items (of various sizes) come to table, which is a great way to enjoy a well-balanced meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-01", "description": "I am torn between 2 and 3 stars. There were a few good dishes but truthfully the food wasn't spectacular and was overpriced. \n\nWhen we first entered, the hostess desk was unmanned so I figured someone will come over to greet or seat us especially with the restaurant being a quarter full. The hostess/waitress (assumed she was a hostess since she didn't wear the same uniform as everyone else) made eye contact, looked confused as to why were in there, then came over but neither greeted or welcomed us. Eye contact and silence. I dig a showdown when I first enter restaurants. Who wouldn't.  \n\nWhen we were seated, the table next to us gave us a hard stare. Perhaps I stunk. Perhaps I'm under-dressed. But the hostess had on clogs with patterned socks and jeans so clearly the dress code isn't white tux and black tie kind of fancy. \n\nI won't lie, our table had some picky eaters. One didn't eat lamb, one didn't like cheese, one was a pescatarian. So we ordered the number of individual tapas according to individual preferences, i.e. we're not going to order a meat item for everyone if only half the party will eat it. We were reminded several times that the tapas was only enough for one, which by the way was already explained on the menu. Once we were done ordering, we were told it wasn't enough. I couldn't pinpoint why the delivery of her responses irked me until I heard her interactions with other tables. As she sat other tables, she first introduced the concept of the menu, explained the number of people each dish is meant for, and the number of dishes she recommended per person. NONE of that was said to our table. We were seated, menus were silently placed on the table, and she silently walked away. Don't get me wrong. It's not that we didn't understand the concept of tapas or raciones, but if she had given that introduction, it wouldn't have felt as judgmental every time her and another waitress kept emphasizing that the tapas are meant only for one.\n\nAfter we were told we didn't have enough food, we ordered two more dishes like obedient diners. Turns out we didn't even need them. We had to pack the last dish, which they forgot and never packed for us. By that time I could care less. \n\nIf you want your wallet to be gouged, come to Contigo. This is the first tapas place I've been to that only sells sangria by the glass. They do not offer pitchers. Rather than offering churros as a dish and hot chocolate as an additional complement to the dish, it's the other way around. Hot chocolate is $5 and you ADD churros for $4. The churros do not automatically come with the chocolate.The hot chocolate was like the consistency of pudding and is meant for dipping; not the watery hot chocolate you normally drink. I'm asking the same question you are: what would anyone do with just a cup of dipping chocolate??? Of course I'll have to add on $4 churros just so I can use my $5 cup of chocolate. \n\nThe only reason I decided on three stars is because there were two waitresses that were friendly. They also promote sustainability and humane animal farming, and sources their produce from local farmers. Kudos to that and only that.", "author": "Ivy T."}

For such a small place, it's not ideal to have 19 people just hanging around waiting\n\n2. It took another 30-40 minutes for them to bring out the first dish on the chef's menu.

Otherwise, I'd destroy my already-high monthly restaurant budget. Whenever someone, tourist or local, is willing to come to Noe though, Contigo is my first recommendation. \n\nThe atmosphere is laid back, without pretense. Close tables and an open kitchen, high-quality food, and a variety of wines (glass/carafe/bottle) combine into an excellent experience in a relaxed atmosphere. Looking over the menu is fun for me, just to see new dishes.\n\nTypically I'm a sucker for sharing required of any tapas-based restaurant. And yet my first meal there was a vegetarian prix fixe. In fact, it was the best veggie meal I've ever eaten and one of my favorite meals ever as well. Whatever you choose, bring an appetite. \n\nPro Move: Try to arrive ahead of your reservation time in order to be seated on time. Walking in for a table still is possible but no matter the case, people generally wait a bit in the long hallway leading to the hosting stand.", "author": "Mike H."}

The location, decor and food were all top notch. You can choose from a large selection of smaller plates to share or have to yourself. They also have the option of a 7-course tasting menu for $40 per person. I believe that everyone at the table must participate if you plan to go this route, but I think it is the way to go.\n\nEach course of the tasting menu is not large but by the end it was the right amount of food for a full dinner. The waiter or waitress will have no problem letting you know which items are on the tasting menu for the night, which takes the guess work out of it. Since the tasting menu is ever-changing you can have a different experience each time you come.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is that the food came out very quickly. At one time we had three different courses on the table because they brought out 2 back to back before we had finished the previous course. It really wasn't an issue except that it made us feel a little rushed and I like to take my time with dinner.\n\nOverall a great place! I would highly recommend.

My bfs meal was delicious melting rip apart meat with mash and some other side veggies but i picked the paella but is the rice supposed to be crunchy? It seemed undercooked i forced it down not really knowing cuz ive never had it but, it was far from delicious. We had mini plates of appetizers of random small items like date wrapped in bacon with a creamy cheese inside and some type salmon and other items i cannot remember. I just didnt want to waste food that was costing my bf so much so i forced it down. The only highlight was the crab salad that was filled of lemon flavored crab. The other thing was the churro and chocolate but it was just heavy for me and to tell u the truth i would have hoped for something more worthwhile than something i can buy anywhere for less than $2. I wanted to try the sorbet but it just didnt seem at all that awesome for what we got. Buying some cheap drinks in order to not go over $200 but we ended up paying with tip a total of almost $230.

Every item I ordered off the appetizers/small plates menu reminded me of why humans evolved tongues and how great that one trip to Barcelona was. Don't remember what I ordered, thanks to whatever excellent, chilled, local white wine I ordered. There were some deep fried breaded balls filled with cheese and something from the ocean, I think. Delectable! Decadent! Raw (or was it smoked?) herring on rustic little toasted things and a tomatoish spread. To die for. Ordered another round of that shizz. A few yummy vegan things, because I like to feel superior when making food choices. And something with that famous Catalan Ham. Oink! Servers were overworked and spread thin because they are dispensing drugs to serious, high-maintenance addicts. Nevertheless, they were affectionate, efficient, and generally awesome.

I'm torn on Contigo because on the one hand the food is fantastic however, on the other hand they only serve tapas here so if you're hungry or have a healthy appetite (like I do) then I'd skip this place. They split the menu between individual portion tapas (1 piece) and medium sized tapas (usually 3 pieces basd on dish). Here's a breakdown of my experience based on my 3 critera: food, service, and environment.\n\nFood - We started with the anchovies and the croquettes. The anchovies and the croquettes are on the individual sized tapas list so we had to place 3 orders of each. Then we had the lamb meatballs and the Halibut. The lamb meatballs and the Halibut were on the medium sized tapas list so we placed 1 order of each and split the it family style. Overall the food was delicious. My only complaint with the food and the restaurant in general is that the tapas are very small (understand that I have a healthy appetite) and they aren't cheap (ranging from approximatley $9 to $30 each) so the tab can get out of hand quickly. \n\nService - Our service was excellent. Our waitor was very helpful, friendly, and attentive. No complaints here.\n\nEnvironment - Contigo has great ambience and is perfect for a date or for a casual meal. They keep the restaurant dimly lit and the noise level is pretty average. You won't need to shout at each other to have a conversation. \n\nOverall, the food at Contigo is fantastic and they provide excellent service, but don't expect your meal to be filling unless you spend over $100 minimum.

Here were a few dishes we ordered:\n- salt cured spanish anchovy montadito (oily fish but great complexity of flavors)\n- jamon iberico de bellota (EH, bread & ham (ham is good though) \n- melocoton con jamon (BEST DISH, flavors galore!) *THUMBS UP*\n- olive oil fried local halibut (EH, bland fried halibut)\n- marin sun lamb rib chops (Good, great yogurt sauce to pair with the lamb)\n- albondigas (breaks apart really easily, its OK)\n\nDefinitely recommend the melocoton con jamon! Overall, everything is good and i'd come back when back in SF.", "author": "Tammy L."}

High quality food, attentive friendly service, nice ambiance.\nI particularly liked the patio area.\n\nCan't have enough:\n- The Albondigas (meatballs) were the bomb!  The meatballs were moist, tender, and very well-seasoned, and the sauce - I could not stop eating it, until the last drop.  \n\nOther tasty dishes:\n- Calamars a la Planxa - grilled calamari is always good, but here the garnish of corn and chorizo complement the calamari very well.  \n- Cantabrian Anchovy Motadito - saw the table next door ordering it... couldn't resist, and it tasted as good as it looked.  \n\nJust OK:\n- Jamon Serrano - hard to be disappointed with this, but seriously the quality of the Jamon here does not seem as high as other places I have been to.\n- Pulpo and Potato Pincho - just ok.

It would have been to have them dry that up before they opened but after a few bottles of wine I don't think anyone noticed.\n\nWe had no idea how much or what to get here so we took our waiters advice and got a good amount of various foods.  I would say the standout was definitely the meatballs (enough so that my friend's wife got them again for dessert).

I *think* that we had one of their two ribeiros, which was like a very light Chardonnay.  No heavy oak, slightly acidic, really pleasant.\n\nTHE MEAL\nI was so looking forward to the pork belly, but they didn't have any!  Damn.  Nothing else mattered after that, so we opted for the evening's tasting menu, which included the following, all served family style:\n\n* Sardine and avocado toast with pickled onions and smoked salt to start us out - OMG, divine.  Get it, lick the toast, smush the sardine on your tongue - so good\n\n* Pork croquettes - you think that you're probably getting a ball of fried pork, right?  Nyet.  It was a dark encrusted fritter with the insides the texture of a mousse, almost - didn't even taste like pork.  Maybe because the pigs are \"acorn-fed\"?\n\n* Fig salad - oh, the seared goat cheese was heaven.  And the texture balance between the arugula, chestnuts, cheese, and figs was a mouth's wet dream.  So well done.\n\n* The spinach and chickpeas - when I saw it on the menu, I thought immediately of Indian food.  There was no Indian flavor to it at all, but this was the least like dish by anyone in our group of four.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\n* Sausage-stuffed calamari - SO tender, the calamari and so deliciously seasoned the sausage.  Number two behind the sardine toast.\n\n* Salmon on fig leaf - when I first saw the salmon, I thought that it was awfully pink to be cooked all the way through.  But, it did end up being cooked enough and boy was it so soft and melt-in-my mouth delectable.  The vegetables underneath included corn, thin, half moons of squash, and cherry tomatoes.\n\n*The pork and pork meatballs.  I write \"pork and pork\" because their menu has it as Pork and jamon which is, essentially, the same thing.  They were just okay.  \n\nDESSERT\nDespite not having enough room in our bellies, there's always room for a bite of dessert.  And so we shared the churros with thick hot chocolate.  The churros weren't as dark and crispy as I like them, though still good.  And the hot chocolate, without accompaniment from the churros, was super duper rich, of course.  Had about two tablespoons poured over my churro and was totally good to go.", "author": "Tamar D."}

I can't believe I've lived in this city for over two years and have never been to Noe Valley. My supervisor had high praise for the restaurant  (she's also a foodie), plus it was another chance to check something off the 7X7  100 Things to Eat Before You Die list.\n\nMy friends and I started to meal off with the little gem salad with roasted beets and garlic chips; goat cheese salad with arugula, apples and hazelnuts; and the jamon iberico de bellota. The salads didn't really impress me much in terms of flavor combinations and they were also small. The jamon was delicious and had a little bit of a smoky flavor.\n\nHands down the best dish of the night was the coca (flatbread) topped with wild nettles, bacon, caramelized onions and manchego cheese. The flatbread was served PIPING hot. That manchego cheese was like burning hot lava and I totally burned my tongue while trying to eat a piece. It was worth the pain because it was absolutely divine. The caramelized onions were cooked to a pulp and were nice and sweet. Bacon always makes any dish better so I'm not going to comment on the bacon. I also liked how there was a little bit of kick with spicy pepper flakes on top. You have to order this dish if you go!\n\nI was surprised that the calamars a la planxa was on the 7X7 list. The squid had a strange consistency and was softer than any squid I've eaten before. It was served on a bed of squid ink rice with chorizo and artichokes mixed in. The rice was really oily and heavy and the chorizo and artichokes didn't add much. I was disappointed because I like squid ink and the rice really didn't have much flavor. The albondigas were tasty and tender. I only wish that the portion was bigger!\n\nFor dessert, we split the churros with \"hot chocolate.\" The hot chocolate was more of a thick, chocolate sauce. It was rich, but not too sweet (though I don't know how you could drink it plain). Is this how Barcelona-style hot chocolate really is? It makes me want to travel to Barcelona and try a fresh cup for myself. The churros were AMAZING. Crispy and fried to perfection and lightly coated in sugar. The combination of churros and hot chocolate pair together perfectly.\n\nOverall, Contigo was an enjoyable meal, but I felt like the portions were a little small. A party of 2-3 people would be perfect. Anything larger and I feel like not everyone would get to have a taste of everything. It was cute to explore Noe Valley a little bit  (it's extremely family-oriented). I don't think it's a restaurant that you need to go out of your way to try, but if you're in the area, Contigo is worth checking out.\n\nRead more reviews and see photos on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/spanish-and-catalan-tapas-at-contigo/", "author": "Jackie T."}

Actually, it wasn't bad at all, and it was a lot of fun watching the cooks work.\n\nService, though not always as attentive as we would have liked, was well-informed and very friendly.  We got the catalan wine flight - somehow they charged us $35 instead of the $30 posted on the menu, but it was still not a bad deal for four glasses of interesting wine.  They even substituted the last glass when we chose a relatively sweet chocolate dessert.\n\nThe sardine tapa was mild and delicious - even my sardine-hating companion enjoyed it.  Our jamon croqueta, on the other hand, arrived nearly burnt with the creamy insides having but a hint of flavor from the jamon.  We looked at all the properly cooked ones going out of the kitchen that night, and cursed our luck.\n\nCatalan style sauteed greens were excellent, despite being somewhat panned by our server - interesting nuts and dried fruit accompanying swiss chard.  Calamars a la plancha was also very enjoyable.\n\nWe had both the lamb tagine and seabass - unremarkable, though the lamb had a nice texture.  With the understanding that this is traditionally a salty cuisine, by the time we got to the tripe dish, we were prepared to declare defeat in the salt wars.\n\nDessert was an excellent rendition of churros with chocolate - the chocolate much better flavored, though less thick, than that served in Spain.  And they put some flakes of salt on top of the chocolate.\n\nExuding more sodium from our pores than normal, we stumbled back into the night.  About six blocks straight up hill to where we parked our car.  Decent food, some dishes are a good value and some are not, but we came equipped with a discount coupon, and left satisfied if a little oversalted.", "author": "Albert H."}

Reminded me of the meat cone at Baccalone's at the Ferry Building.  The Lomo were small lean not fatty cuts of delcious procured meats.  I enjoyed it, but didn't fall in love.\n\nI also enjoyed the Calamars a la Planxa with chanterelle mushrooms and parsley, but again, eh . . . I liked the strong lemony flavor, but my dining companion did not.  Too much citrusy goodness for her.\n\nAlbondigas (AKA Pork and Jamon Meatballs) were okay.  I keep comparing the meatballs and tomato sauce to the one's at Beretta, and no one has been able to come even close to the delectable scumpdiliumptiousness of Beretta.  Worse yet, the meatballs had this slight gamey flavor.\n\nPatatas Bravas were unremarkable.  Fried to perfection with a nice sprinkling of flavors, but the salsa and allioli topping it didn't do it for me.\n\nOverall, I was underwhelmed, and for about $60 (not including tip) for two people, I probably won't come back to try the other dishes.", "author": "Christina L."}

I like to think it's my little secret spot that no one knows about, a place I can go with my friends and never have to worry about it becoming too hipster, but I think the word is out. Contigo is the place to eat.\n\nI first went here in September for an anniversary dinner with my partner and two friends. We brought a nice bottle of Pinot with us ($20 corkage) and ended up ordering another bottle off the menu (bottles are a little pricey - most are over $40). We started with the anchovies and bocadillos as an amuse bouche to curb our hunger. And then we kept gordering the anchovies and the boquerones. I think we ordered three rounds of those because they were so good! Let's call this Round 1.\n\nRound 2 included the little gem salad, the sauteed greens catalan style, the coca (flatbread), the olives and my personal favorite -the jamon iberico! I first had jamon iberico when I went to Barcelona this summer and this is the only restaurant in SF that has it on the menu. It is so mild, so sweet, so salty. The satiating five pieces linger in my mouth for the rest of the night. I love you, jamon iberico.\n\nRound 3 was meat and seafood - squid, beef and octopus. Dear lord, was it fantastic. I could've sworn they caught the seafood in the morning and brought it to the restaurant for dinner.\n\nRound 4 - dessert. Churros (Xurros) dipped in thick Barcelona-style hot chocolate. I wanted to cry it was so good. I know we had one other thing but I can't remember right now what it was....I just remember everything tasting amazing. There was nothing I didn't like.\n\nI went back here again last Saturday and it was still some of the best food I've had in the city. I really feel like I am in Barcelona for the night at a cool, mellow tapas bar. The ambience is fantastic, the service is friendly and the food is out of this world. California cuisine meets Catalunya. If there is any place you should go with your best friends, it is here. Just make sure I'm not there that night....I want to keep it my little secret.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

Finally the ling cod, the lamb - which had the consistency of carnitas - loved it, pork belly (my first time!), two flat breads, brussel sprouts - yum! and patatas bravas.  There was nothing I didn't like or find underwhelming.  I just really loved every little bite.  We also enjoyed a couple wines, tried some sherry and finished with cava.

I was thrilled to hear of it coming--really wanted it to be great--but sadly, it's just medicore.\n\nI've been three times.  I found it very subpar compared to any other tapas restaurant in the Bay Area (and I've lived in Madrid).  The service is ok.  But the food is incredibly salty.  We had squid, ham, patatas brava, anchovys--we took what the waiter recommended as it was close to the type of tapas I usually order anyway. Nothing to write home about.  I've had better at Andalu, Cha Cha Cha, Ramblas back in the day. There are just too many other tapas and other restaurants in the same price range that are loads better (Bar Jules, Bar Bambino...).  Next door to Contigo are a variety of ok neighborhood eateries.  If you made me choose between Contigo and them, I'd definitely prefer:  Hamano Sushi, Barney's Burgers, Lupe Italian, and Incanto.  If I had to choose between Basso and Contigo, I'd just go to the Whole Food Salad Bar instead.\n\nYet whenever I walk by, it's somewhat crowded.  So, just like with Mission Chinese, there are just some things I don't get in life.  \n\nI don't really based my Yelp stars on service.  I try to focus on the food.  If the soup nazi were in SF, I'd be okay with patronizing that place and putting up with the abuse.  In the past, the service has been passable/fine.  But for whatever reason, one winter evening, my date and I were the first people at the restaurant at 530 pm.  The host seated us at the one worst table possible.  We were dressed nice--we were attractive.  But why give us the patio table with the strong freezing draft (billowing then freezing my hair into sheets) when NO ONE ELSE was there?  we requested a change of tables, and they really struggled with that request for 10 minutes.  Let me repeat, we were the only people in the restaurant, and we were still wearing our heavy coats at our tables.  When I told them we needed to leave or die of exposure, they begrudgingly gave us another table--not even inside.  30 minutes later, finally more customers showed up (25% full).  But by then we were done and gone. \n\nIf your date knows food, men, you won't get a second date after taking her there.  If it were my prediction alone--I'd say this place would be closed by early 2013.  But I understand that other people have different tastes from me.  Just so you can callibrate with me, if you had to ask my favorite last five restaurants i ate at in sf were:\n\n1.  benu\n2.  delfina (but not locanda as much)\n3.  umami burger\n4.  amphawa thai on geary--surprisingly good for thai\n5.  pizetta 211\n\nOutside of SF, I've had wonderful meals, expensive and cheap at:\n\n1. Olivetos\n2. Summer Kitchen\n3. B Side BBQ\n4. Pizzaiola\n5. Kirala Sushi\n\nAll these places I've mentioned above are 8 or 10s/ out of 10.  Contigo is a 4.", "author": "Philip L."}

Pimientos de padron - an assortment of bite sized peppers (some spicy, some not) roasted to perfection with sea salt\n\n5.

Although the dining space isn't very large, the open kitchen and abundance of natural light makes it seem slightly larger than it is.  I will say that seating was somewhat cramped... and why they would seat us next to the only other diners in the entire restaurant when there was plenty of open space elsewhere was a mystery.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly.  A little bit scattered at time, but overall they did a good job.\n\nFOOD: Eeehhhh... nothing stood out to me.  We ordered a few items:\n- Sardine + avocado toast ($3): Good pairing of oily fish and fatty avocado, with the pickled onion to cut through the fat.  I think I would've enjoyed this bite more if the avocado had been sliced instead of mashed to a thin paste.\n- Little gem salad ($12): Light & refreshing.  I wish there were more beets and that the garlic chips were more flavorful.  It was not worth $12.\n- Coca (flatbread; $15): The version we had had chantarelle mushrooms and some porky product, along with a divine cheese.  My fave of the items we ordered, it was essentially a fancy pizza.  The crust was delicious, with a slightly smoky flavor from the wood-fired oven (?) they baked it in.  The flavors were bold yet harmonious, and I had to stop myself from inhaling the entire thing.\n- Local xipirons (squid) a la Planxa ($14): very tender squid, but slightly bland in flavor.  J didn't care for the beans in this dish, and thought the sauce was too watery.\n- Tripe with chorizo & chickpeas ($9): VERY tender tripe.  The sauce was basically a ragout, chunky and yummy.  I wish I had some bread to eat with this dish. \n- Molasses cake ($9): basically a spiced gingerbread-y cake.  I was expecting moist decadence based on the description, so imagine my disappointment when I took a bite of extremely crumb-y DRY cake! :( BOOFACE.  However, the salted caramel sauce was a delightful pairing with the cake flavor.\n\nOVERALL: I wasn't wowed by the food, but if I lived in the neighborhood, I could see this restaurant entering my weekly rotation.

The vibe is energetic yet comfortable. The seating leans towards bar stools or small tables - so perhaps better suited for date nights or as a place to meet up with a smaller group of friends. There is a patio area which looks like it would be gorgeous in the warmer months. \n\nThe menu is well-prepared, interesting and consistent (although I did find certain items leaned a bit to the salty side). But for the most part, all of our food was very tasty and catered to a wide spectrum of preferences - from small plates and finger foods to larger, heartier dishes. They also offer a fairly broad wine list - including a nice selection of imported beers, authentic cavas and traditional sherries. \n\nA definite recommendation for anyone interested in exploring Spanish tapas with good energy in a great San Francisco neighborhood.", "author": "Gigi G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-13", "description": "I didn't know much about Contigo when I went there for dinner this past Saturday but I do love tapas and Catalan cuisine so I was definitely excited to go.  Sadly, I should have left my excitement at home.  To call Contigo a big disappointment is unfair so we'll just leave it at . . . disappointment.\n\nWhen trying a new restaurant I like to experience as much of its cuisine as I can.  In that vein, my table and I opted for the chef's tasting menu.  For $40 per person we purportedly got the seven best dishes of the night.  If we ate the top seven, I feel bad for other patrons who ate the dishes in the bottom seventy-five percent of the menu.  I will say though that $40 per person for a comprehensive tasting menu is a good deal.\n\nOur meal started out with the arugula and strawberry salad.  The salad was balanced and tasty if you got all of the ingredients in your mouth in one bite.  If you didn't, the salad was unbalanced, a bit tart, and the strawberry flavor was misplaced.  In a continuing theme throughout the evening, or next course, the Monterey sardine on avocado toast, was brought out before we had finished our prior course (this happened with every single course).  The Monterey sardines were good if you like salty fish (which I do).  Our next dish was the beet salad which was nothing special.  The beets could have been roasted and pickled a bit more (a la Chez Panisse).   \n\nNext, we were served the Calamari with squid ink rice.  The Calamari was good but lacked a \"wow\" factor.  Following the squid was the Albondigas (pork meatballs).  These were dry and bland.  How you screw up Albondigas is beyond me but then again Contigo messed up Patatas Bravas (more on that later).  \n\nOur next course was the seared halibut which was overcooked and dry.  The sauce served with it was good but the errors in cooking the fish ruined the dish.  By this point in time our table was pretty full.  We'd had salads and we'd had proteins . . . yet strangely enough, it was at this point in time that the chef thought it was a good idea to cap our meal with a big plate of sauteed greens.  Needless to say, given that they weren't very good, all the table did was pick at it.\n\nOne of the patrons in my party, being informed that the patatas bravas was not part of our seven course meal, ordered it separately as she is a huge fan.  Unfortunately, she regretted her additional order.  The patatas bravas were cooked poorly (didn't really get the crispy exterior) and were served with an aioli more similar to sour cream and a bland romesco sauce.  Needless to say, neither she nor I was pleased with the dish.\n\nFor all you Yelpers who don't live in Noe Valley, you aren't missing anything if you don't make it to Contigo.  And for all you Yelpers who do live in Noe Valley, I'm sorry that Contigo is taking up valuable restaurant real estate in your neighborhood.", "author": "Oski B."}

You'd expect a better attitude from the staff if you spent that kind of money at this kind of restaurant ... but once we paid the bill the hostess and waiters started making circles around our table showing they wanted us to leave ASAP, then in a couple of minutes one of the waiters came to our table saying something like \"thank you for coming, come again\" obviously meaning \"you've paid your bill and now we want you to leave\". \n\nAnd now - the food. It was mediocre, not bad and not something special (as correctly pointed out one of the reviewers you could get this kind of food at a local Whole Foods buffet). Size of all portions ... like for little babies. First we ordered sampler ($40 per person, 7 tiny micro dishes per person), well they were so tiny that even kids complained they were still hungry, then we ordered more - again very small portions although little bigger then 7-course samplers, same size of tiny micro-baby-burgers though (diameter of a large overcoat button). We've been to Spain and we know Spanish cuisine, well this food is not exactly Spanish cuisine, a Californian version of Spanish food, twice smaller portion.\n\nWine is just okay, nothing special except the prices, nothing from Spain you cannot find at a local Safeway or a local Lucky's. \nWatch out for what they bring because one of our guests ordered a glass of quite expensive dessert wine which he didn't get, instead a guy faking Spanish accent brought a glass of some kind of Porto which was obvious, but no apologies, just kept insisting it was the wine that was ordered even though our guest is a wine expert, so he would know the difference. \n\nDessert - just okay, nothing spectacular. Oh, wait. They brought anchovies we ordered earlier (and forgot about) at the same time they brought the dessert, quite a touch, isn't it.\n\nThe bottom line - never again. The food is mediocre. The place is extremely overpriced given the food quality and portions sizes. The service is just a bit below average and the place is somewhat cramped.", "author": "John C."}

It was also quite unfair for our friends who had driven in from San Jose to meet us at the restaurant. The staff kept apologizing and telling us the people at the table reserved for us weren't getting up and assured us that we would be \"taken care of,\" whatever that meant. \n\nI know it's fine line when restaurants have reservations lined up and a table won't leave. It can be a delicate situation but what bothered me about the way Contigo handled it was they made empty promises of us being \"taken care of\" and their inconsistency in dealing with these matters. We had to wait for our table because the restaurant couldn't/wouldn't ask the people to leave but we heard from two other friends who had dined there on separate occasions that they were asked to leave when they weren't ready to go because there were people \"waiting\" for their table. \n\nAs far as being \"taken care of\" we received a complimentary dish of Pa amb tom\u00e0quet but that was pretty much it.

Traditional tapas style plates from the Catalan region of Spain are their staple, and they are excellent.  The service is good and the ambiance is very nice.\n\nWhat is lacking is their drink menu.  They have a nice selection of Spanish wines from regions known for their vineyards...lots from La Rioja.  Unfortunately, that is about it.  They have no liquor license, which is not uncommon in this city, although nevertheless disappointing.  The least a restaurant can do is make up for this shortcoming with other great beer options and maybe some sangria.  Plus, they could take advantage of the Spanish edge they're going for to serve claras, tintos de verano, and calimocho...albeit that would be far more Andalucian than Catalan ;) \n\nWe tried their sidra...which in Spain is typically from Asturias, and actually quite good, even though I am not normally a fan of cider.  This sidra was from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and it was not good at all...flavorless and kind of gross, not to mention 12 bucks, and totally not worth it.  They only have two other non-wine options: a pilsner and an IPA.  And their pilsner was all tapped out.\n\nIf you have been to Spain it is very possible you have only had Mahou or Cruz Campo, and know that neither is much better than a Bud.  However, La Alhambra, a brewery in Granada makes 1925, a pilsner style lager and La Mezquita, a stronger malty beer with over 6% alcohol content.  I'm not saying they should pay the prices to import these beers from Spain, but they could certainly offer a more extensive selection without compromising their authenticity...if that's what they are striving to maintain.  \n\nI will definitely continue to enjoy eating at this restaurant, and hope they acquire a liquor license and improve their beer selection.", "author": "Leah R."}

However, one hour and half is way too long for the last of our orders to be delivered.  To be clear, the restaurant was pretty busy at the time we placed our orders but I would expect any serious restaurant to anticipate spikes in activity around that hour and to manage those spikes accordingly.  The restaurant offered us two complimentary desserts to make up for their delay in serving us our food, but everyone in my party felt like that offer was too little too late.", "author": "Jaime C."}

So I asked my man to take me there for my birthday.\nThe ambience is spot-on; gorgeous wood tables, mason jars, everything looked sleek with a touch of granola. Cozy seating where you almost are beside your neighbor.  Great for a date. Totally San Francisco the way I like it. All of the stars go to this element alone.\nSadly, the food was so bland. The corn dish was ordinary.  The pork bellies were literally a bite and a half in puffy bread. People rave about that belly, but I've had plenty of wonderful pork belly in my life, and this aint it.

I always enjoy the ambiance, drinks and food. But tonight I met there with 3 friends and was pretty bitterly disappointed by the service. In short, we were there for a little over two hours and were talking for about 10 minutes after we got the check when the hostess came over and politely asked us to hurry up and leave. I don't consider two hours an overly long dinner, nor have I ever been asked to hurry up before at a restaurant. I was very surprised, taken aback and, as I said, disappointed. Also, they sat us in the enclosed patio where, despite heat lamps, it was freezing cold half the time. We were all very cold and had our coats on. Patio is awesome in the other three seasons, not so much in the winter! Overall, an old standby made me kind of sad tonight.", "author": "Mstar P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-21", "description": "While each of the dishes of the tasting menu was tasty, I think the $46 per person was way overpriced given what was served. The potatoes were good but Plow serves far better potatoes as a side dish to their breakfast menu. The paella was spiced well but very skimpy on the shrimp and seafood given that there were three of us and we each ordered the tasting menu, The little gem salad again was fresh and tasty but the size was barely adequate for 2 people,  not 3.  We appreciated the sourcing of the menu from farms at the Ferry Building Farmers' Market and really enjoyed the freshness. However, I really think this is a great place for someone who  thinks the food isn't good unless it's overpriced. We are not budget shoppers and have no problem paying for high quality, but this restaurant sadly tries to pass skimpiness off in a \"small dish\" format. In addition, we really felt rushed. Because we paused between the main meal and deciding on dessert, the waiters, hostess and others kept coming by to ask \"is everything alright?\" implying that we should get moving. because they had already cleared the table. There were a few empty tables around us so we were not holding up a big crowd. I was hoping to find another nice neighborhood place, but sadly, I don't think this is it.", "author": "junona j."}

The pork and jamon meatballs were so delicious we had to order more. I loved the flavor combination of the olives/almonds/pickled veggies dish.

My wine affordability is about $50-$60 maximum. My dilemma is that I recently started dating a really nice girl and she only drinks white wine, while I mostly only drink red. I know we should dump each other and get our money back from EHarmony, how could they a match red wine person with a white wine person.  Everything else is in harmony so we will soldier on with this difficult relationship. Okay back to my whine.  Now that we have to order wine by the glass, I noticed how many different restaurants measure the amount they serve in a typical glass of wine.  A bottle of wine holds 750ml, most bars and restaurants serve four glasses of 175ml per bottle (the other 5ml for testing the wine by you or the Sommelier).  Restaurants are in the business to make a profit and the mark up on wine sometimes seems excessive, but rents in San Francisco are not cheap and they have to pay all the overheads etc. so a bottle of wine that retails in your local supermarket for $15 is now $60 in a restaurant.  Okay I agree with mark up, BUT what I don't agree with is the stingy restaurants that pour 125ml glasses of wine instead of the usual 175ml, and thus get six glasses out of a bottle instead of the usual four.  We had a fantastic dinner at Contigo, but they are one of the \"Stingy\" restaurants and serve 125ml of wine per glass.

Only one of us didn't completely finish our meal, which must be a good sign since the portions were certainly adequate.\n\nDesert was shared -- thick hot chocolate and churros and some sort of blueberry tart with a dollop of ice cream.  Very nice but by then I knew I had eaten a bit more than my fill.  \n\nI'll most likely try Contigo again.", "author": "Jens H."}

Had the pleasure of dining with some friends here for a early Sat dinner before catching a flight back to LA, and I must say I very much enjoyed myself. \n\nAlthough we coudln't grab a table on the little garden patio, it may have been a blessing in disguise as it was a rather chilly night and the hostess graciously moved us to a table right next to the glass doors, so we got the best of both worlds.  \n\nThe decor is just to my taste, simple, clean, neat and grainy hardwoods with stainless steel accents abound and a bright light green colors cleveryly placed throughout.  The restaurant itself seems like it could have been a former house that was gutted and remodeled to form a long restaurant space.  The patio in back looks like exactly that, a quaint small yard with wood beams holding up heaters and a nice canopy for a feeling of being outdoors without being exposed to the elemets.\n\nThe food was outstanding!  The platas bravas was amazing with cripsy potatoes, a salsa sauce with some zing, and a wonderfully creamy aiolo.  The tripe and garbanzo is flavored perfectly and perfect with some crusy bread.  The lamb with couscous is also amazing tender and braised just right.\n\nAll in all a great meal, while a bit pricey for tapas, we found the portions to be perfect to share between 4 people, with enough in portions for everyone to have a taste.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

But after the first visit it wasn't exactly a 4 star experience. \n\nThe food overall was quite good, well executed. Though, there were not alot of standouts for me to mention, the sliced meats were good, Lomo and proscuitto presented on a board and thinly sliced which was good. The patatas bravas were excellent, nice heat and crispy. The croquetas were a bit wet and sploogy, I am used to them being a bit more firm and the pork belly was a disappointment, with the meat being dry and the fat not quite rendered enough (our server highly recommended it which made it more of a dissappointment). \n\nThe burnt caramel flan was delicious, but the churros and chocolate missed the mark. The churros were really crispy almost like some sort of cracker stick and the chocolate was very thin, not an authentic Barcelona experience sadly.\n\nFinally, while our server was excellent, made good recommendations on the wine and made sure we were happy, the small plates all came out at once overcrowding the table and making for a truly strange and incongruous eating experience. A place whose main focus is small plates Spanish tapas should really know better...the idea is to have a leisurely meal with the specific plates that go together being served together. The hot brussel sprouts should not come out with the cold sliced meats board..it just messes up your palate. And our busboy seemed to be really anxious to move us along even though there were empty tables and nobody waiting and it was quite early...one of my biggest pet peeves is a busboy removing a plate while there is still food on it. When the plates are so small to begin with one bite is almost a third of the plate....why would you try and take that way! \n\nIn the end we felt rushed and confused. I will definitely go back because I love Spanish food, the atmosphere was nice and there are so few places in San Francisco where you can get quality tapas. But next time I will be specific about the order of the plates and hope that the bus boy situation was fluke.", "author": "Kai H."}

It was a great tasting having that served side by side with a more traditional Serrano Prosciutto from Iowa (at $9 per 2oz.). I preferred the Iberico, but others felt the opposite.\n\nAlso good was the swordfish and orange on orange salad.

The avocado and olive oil melded perfectly with a bit of heat to bring out the flavors in this dish.  We also had a quite tasty rabbit with bacon and chestnuts, which was served as a roulade (although not described that way on the menu).  Dessert was a rather tasty persimmon cheesecake, which I could have sworn tasted exactly like pumpkin.\n\nOverall, Contigo produced one of the best meal experiences I've had recently featuring fresh, delicious produce.  Service was generally good.   The only odd thing was the hostess...when we wanted to get a table, she must have pushed about 200 buttons (no exaggeration), then walked away twice without saying anything and finally gave us a time of about 30 minutes (which in reality was 10).

The waiters are really friendly and ready to explain everything on the menu. They have a great wine list of everything from Spain. \nThis is one of the few places that serves Jamon Iberico, just like how we remembered it, except we wish there was more of it and its not sliced so thinly! For tapas, we had oxtail coquette and pulpo. Its not clear on the menu, but we expected there to be more than 1 each per order, especially for the price of it! Regardless, it was really tasty, the pulpo was nice and smokey, soft and not chewy. The oxtail had a rich flavor and really nicely fried on the outside. Happy! For Raciones we had the calamares with squid ink rice, and the beet salad. The calamares were really amazing, full flavored, lots of spices. The beet salad was very refreshing, but seems more californian than spanish to me. Then we also had the hot chocolate with churros for dessert. Overall, all the dishes were very well prepared and flavors were very well balanced. The portions are very small and prices pretty steep. Last but not least, they support local small businesses and farmers. On the reverse side of the dessert menu, they list out all the sources for their ingredients that evening, they even have their very own small garden that they harvest from.

It was still a $50/person meal, so I wouldn't say that we skimped too much. \n\nThe wine list was among the pricier that I have seen lately, so we elected for one of the more economical options--sherry. More condescending comments from our waitress--\"were we sure what we were ordering?\" Yes, we were sure.  Turned out the menu was wrong and the list price was for a 1/2 bottle, so we changed our order and got a wine in the end. A good restaurant might have honored their mistaken pricing, but not Contigo.\n\nThe food was good. The churros were great--the chocolate could have have had a thicker consistency if they really were going for true Spanish-style churros con chocolate.\n\nWe're a well-traveled, well-cultured foodie lot and there are enough tapas restaurants in the city that I probably won't come here again. Esperpento, for instance, serves up the classic Spanish dishes at a fraction of the cost and I've always had good service there.

Maybe their supply chain was out of whack because the suppliers in Spain were on Vacation in August.

This was a great way to go, because we got a taste of all the favorites, including:\n- patatas bravas (the red sauce had a great kick)\n- beets and clementines (super fresh)\n- asparagus, jamon chips, egg (we fought for that one piece of bacon)\n- octopus and fingerling potatoes (cooked to perfection, not chewy at all)\n- lengua (I didn't even know I was eating beef tongue until someone told me afterwards)\n- lamb and pork meatballs (yummy)\n- bacon, asparagus and tronchon flatbread (my favorite of the two flatbreads)\n- jamon, arugula and manchego flatbread (a bit too salty for me)\n\nAfter the flatbreads, we decided to move on to dessert -- this time, we selected three that we wanted to try: chocolate sauce with churros, pear tart and vanilla flan with salted caramel. The desserts did not disappoint! All this plus a bottle of Martin Berdugo tinto del pais? $37 per person!\n\nIf these are the flavors of Barcelona, I've got to book a trip there asap!

The place was poppin' serving upscale tapas for a downscale crowd in quiet Noe Valley.\n\nWe decided to go for it and had the chef send out his favorites. Good choice! The potatoes bravas came first, and judging from their spicy, crunchy deliciousness I knew we could expect good things from the rest of the menu. The octopus and the beef tongue with lentils were the clear stand-outs... yum! Our party of 6 ended the meal happily stuffed after spending only $40 each. \n\nDon't forget to indulge in dessert! It would be a crime to ignore the sweet side of this menu. The flan is made with salted caramel and the churros are hot, crispy and golden with a dark and sultry chocolate dipping sauce. We couldn't get enough of the pear pastry's addictive almond filling. Ah... the perfect antidote to this never ending sweet tooth o' mine.\n\nOkay, we've got a winner.

Easiest way to nab a table? Invite five friends along and make a reservation, which is exactly what we did last night.\n\nWe decided to let the chef send out his favorite dishes, which was a brave decision but ultimately a great way to try some standards. Out of the smaller plates, my clear favorites were the octopus, patatas bravas (some of the best I've had) and the lamb and pork meatballs.\n\nThe asparagus, jamon chips, egg had one tiny piece of incredible bacon but the rest of the dish was kind of just eh. Beets, clementines and ricotta sounded great but again, didn't move me at all. And the \nlengua was fine but lacked flavor (kind of ironic considering it's tongue) My main issue with all of the small plates (or as they call them, Pica-Pica) is the fact that the portion size is incredibly small at $8 a pop.\n\nWe tried two different flatbreads from the woodburning oven and I enjoyed both of them, the jamon version probably a bit more than the bacon one. \n\nWe shared three desserts: the hot chocolate con churros was a decadent treat - super rich chocolate and tasty, sweet churros paired well together. I'm not a big phan flan but was satisfied with my one bite. And the pear tart had a crispy crust that was difficult to cut through with our forks - again, fine but nothing special.\n\nI guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder - I thought our dinner good albeit overpriced given the portion size but most of my dining companions raved about the meal. Despite my waifish figure, I can eat...and I left Contigo hungry. I would probably come back and order some flatbread and a glass of wine, but definitely not for a full meal on an empty stomach.", "author": "phil h."}

So don't expect midwestern portions.  We got a range of cold and hot appetizers and one of the wood-oven pizzas.\n\nThe menu changes frequently so I won't bother going through each dish.  Lets just say that they batted around 60 percent.--not inedible but nothing to write home about.  Several of the dishes were under-seasoned.  And the egg-add-on to the pizza was way overcooked.  No yolk to ooze.  The waitress was apologetic and promised to get it taken off our bill.  A new restaurant should at least be this accomodating.  BUT BEWARE of EMPTY PROMISES.  The bill did not reflect her words.  Read carefully.  \n\nGrowing pains?  I hope.  Noe can use all the dining options.  But I'm not likely to head back anytime soon.  Food & service: So-So.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-18", "description": "Take a trip to Contigo and you'll feel like you're stepping into one of the best tapas restaurants in Barcelona.  All you'll be missing is the Gaudi architecture outside and the rambunctious Catalans inside.  I'm hoping Contigo finds a way to import the latter along with their spectacular Spanish delicacies.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy, without being too cramped.  The night I went, which happened to be their 2nd week anniversary, there was a line leading to the door.  I've heard of 2 hours waits, but lets chalk that up to only being one of the most anticipated openings in SF, people!\n\nI was able to sneak in and sit at the bar.  This is probably the best seat in the house because you get to see all the action in the open kitchen.  From the sizzling flat breads in the wood-fired oven, to the flat top with pork belly griddling, to the skillful plating and service of the staff at the bar, you'll be treated to stunning visuals as you anticipate your meal.\n\nOrdering a trio of what chef Emerson has dubbed \"pica-pica\", or tapas to the layperson, is probably the best deal on the menu (3/$21).  This was plenty to serve one person, and provided the best opportunity to sample a range of traditional (and slightly fanciful) takes on Catalan cuisine.\n\nTortilla de Hongos - having been to Barcelona many times, this is one of my staples and the way i judge a tapas restaurant.  its like going to a thai restaurant and ordering Pad Thai.  its a simple dish, but tells a lot about a place if they can make it well.  Simply put, one of the best tortillas i've ever had.  Great ratio of egg to potato to mushroom.  Soft without being mushy, perfectly seasoned and a wonderful blend of earthy & creamy tastes.\n\nCroquetas de Bacalao - i believe its illegal to call yourself a Catalan restaurant and not serve salt cod, or bacalao.  If it isn't, it should be.  Because in the right hands, bacalao is one of the greatest foods on the planet.  It the wrong hands, though, it can be a salty mess.  Originally used as the way to preserve the massive quantities of fish needed to feed pre-refrigeration Spain, salt cod has been elevated to the status of an icon for Spanish cuisine.  The croquetas at Contigo kept the legacy of this ingredient alive and strong.  With a crispy exterior hiding an intensely creamy and vibrantly fishy interior without the over abundance of that salt once used to cure it, these croquetas are subtle and lovely.\n\nBocadillo de Cerdo - Ah, and the climax of the trio, the bocadillo de cerdo.  Served on the softest mini-bun, this amalgamation of pork belly, onions and harissa aioli is just like biting into a piece of heaven, if heaven is made of pork belly.  And let me tell you, my heaven is. :)  The perfect blending of flavors between creamy, smoky pork belly, the slightly sweet onions and the subtle spiciness of the aioli.  I only wish i would have just ordered 5 of these on a plate for dinner!\n\nTo match the cerdo, I paired one of my favorite and up-and-coming wines.  The Dev Patel (see Slumdog Millionaire) of wines, if you will: Bierzo, from a small district in Spain.  Lovely fruit and richness to match with the pork, but a little overpowering for the other two dishes.\n\nSadly, the only downside of the whole meal was the dessert.  The Flam (no, not spelled Flan, as I was told by the knowledgeable wait staff), was good but not amazing.  A nice way to end the meal, but didn't match the deliciousness of its predecessors.  I'm kicking myself for not having the chocolate and churros, but I'll rectify that next time. ;)\n\nAnd this review would not be complete if I didn't mention the attention paid by the wait staff.  Clearly, they know they're under the microscope, but this knowledge did not stop them from being approachable and incredibly pleasant on a night where they were clearly over-subscribed.  The hostess Elan, and my waitress, Norma, were both so sweet, coming by every 10 mins to see how i was doing and to chat with me about the food & drinks.  They even sent over chef Emerson to thank me for coming by at the end of the evening.  Nice touch, and i applaud them for their attentiveness.\n\nNow, you might wonder, with all this praise, why not a 5-star rating?  Well, let me tell you dear reader, 5-stars are hard to come by.  They are reserved for the places that hold a special piece of my heart.  Whether by circumstance (an amazing birthday meal) or by simple perfection (everything exceeded expectations, from food, to wine to service), they are not given out willy-nilly.  While this place could certainly deserve 5-stars, I'm going to reserve that last star for a future visit to see if they maintain their quality and dedication to service.  So stay tuned for the next installment of this review ...", "author": "Brian F."}

We sat at the Cava bar once for dinner and the bartender was a riot. \n\nThe food! A lot of people go to Contigo and are surprised - because it's Catalan, which is slightly different from many of the popular tapas bars here in SF. It's still amazing. They've been one of the only Spanish restaurants to carry the real-deal Jamon Iberico - if you've ever been to Spain and had the real thing, you *KNOW* what I'm talkin' about. Not to mention the oxtail croquettes - I'm not a huge fan of weird eats, but you gotta try these things if they're on the menu. Incredibly tender and flavorful. \n\nThe ambiance is great, too, I love the neutrals + one-color (green) scheme they got goin' on. It may not be authentic old-world Spain, but it still has a great feel - a little formal-ish, good for a first (or second) date.", "author": "Jennifer A."}

First up, I was immediately taken aback at the decor.  It was the perfect convergence of modern Californian with a minimalist yet cozy flare.  The setting eminated a very warm ambiance with cedar-colored wood varnishes and stainless steel touches.  \n\nAs for our server, Rodolfo, he was eager and exceptionally knowledgeable about the best picks on the menu.  [As a quick aside: I couldn't help but notice that he bore a very striking resemblance to Jim Caviezel of \"Passion of the Christ\" and \"Angel Eyes\" fame.]  He wound up making some favorable recommendations for wine and for the dishes we ultimately wound up selecting.\n\nThe *only* thing that might knock this experience down a star was that we ordered the Halibut Crudo, but it never came to our table.  In retrospect, it's fine, for my girlfriend and I were satisfied with what did come out of the kitchen and one more plate might've pushed us over the edge.\n\nBeautiful space, great location nestled away in the uberly-charming neighborhood of Noe Valley, and great staff on hand to attend to all of your needs.

Some highlights (restaurant decor, beet salad, water options) but now \"get\" why yelpers feel price and quality/quantity of food do not match. Service was fair but maybe when you forget to put the order in for the egg on our flatbread, make it up to us somehow...right? 'Cuz it would have been a world better with it - I suspect. Seated right away but it was 5:45.\n\n$120 (with tip) for six small plates, flatbread, chicken entree, two wine, one beer, dessert and coffee. Sounds like a lot of food, right? Well, walking home, husband threatened to stop at Firefly for a \"real\" meal. Overall, the food was fair. Two salads (beet, chickory) were excellent if not a tad overdressed for such fine food. Calamari was not as tender as I would like but had great flavor. Sardines were not my cup of tea. Mussels were fair - better options in SF so I would not order again. The crudo tasting plate of \"mar\" options was our fave - beautifully executed and fun to look at. Flatbread was dull (we had the vegetarian as don't eat pork). Chicken was quite good although somewhat boring and uninspired on the plate with just a few mushrooms and some greens. Loved the BB coffee in the french press and our scoop of coffee ice cream was great.\n\nProbably the most annoying part was the first-date couple sitting a mere six inches away from us. This is why one hates when tables are crowded together - any more of their \"why do I have to work so hard....I need six months off\" and \"what is called here? No-eat Valley? Stroller Valley?\" and there might have been some words. Oh yeah, and the co-ed bathroom was filthy...concrete floors display where anyone splashed liquids and clearly some have not been aiming well at all.\n\nDoubt we'll be back soon even though it's a five minute stroll away. If were to do so, would sit at the bar and go for a glass of wine and a cheese plate pre-\"real\" meal.", "author": "Karin S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-13", "description": "While many of the businesses along the main 24th St. corridor of Noe Valley shutter, Contigo is on fire with popularity. They clearly set the stage for this hype well within the foodie community through connections, but that's as it should be because I found my experience lived up to the current buzz. Contigo, in my opinion, joins a short list of perpetually popular, quality restaurants (Zuni, Town Hall, Slanted Door, Destino, Range, etc.)\n\nThe food: \nDelicious, seasonal, high-quality. Everything was very well prepared and perfectly seasoned. I'm in culinary school, so I'm picky. Sometimes the simplest things tell the most about a place, and here the potatas bravas (fried potatoes) were one of my favorite things just for their spicing and the two accompanying sauces. I overheard someone saying the menu changes daily to accommodate the whims of the season. I have deep respect for places that are truly seasonal like this. \n\nThe decor: Gorgeous. They took a space that used to be a computer store (!!) and turned it into one of the most stunningly light, modern and welcoming spaces. The back patio, somewhat enclosed and with space heaters, is a gem. \n\nThe service: Very professional and thoughtful, despite being busy. They provided helpful recommendations, and I loved the complimentary filtered water (flat or sparkly) bottles they provide for your table. \n\nThe cost: Extremely reasonable for what this place is. We didn't drink much (one glass of wine and an iced tea), had four small plates and a side of bread. But for the two of us it was plenty (I was stuffed enough I didn't have room for dessert). With tip, under $30/person. \n\nI think most peoples complaints are simply the difficulty of getting in. We went early (6:15 on a Monday) and sat right down. If you go later, you should realize it is going to be a challenge to sit down, especially if you have a large party, and be willing to wait. They also have two bars (one in front of the kitchen and one the actual bar) that you can eat at (also adding this to my list of places where you can eat watching the kitchen, love that!).

We made a reservation, although when we walked in at 6, the place was pretty empty. Upon first walking in, I noticed the decor. I'm a big fan of the long narrow dining room and the simplistic set-up with an open kitchen so that was a plus. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. \n\nI had a glass of Rose that was delicious, my only issue was that I didn't know where any of the wines were from and none seemed to be local. This seemed weird to me because even though I know it is a Spanish style tapas bar, the waiter did brag about the fact that they tried to buy locally (the back of the dessert menu even showed all their local providers).\n\nWe decided to order the Tapas tasting menu. A little pricey (at 40 per person) but what the heck? When in Rome... My favorites were the calamari and black rice and the salmon. The sardine crostini was also really good. They gave us Iberian ham wrapped around manchengo cheese which wasn't on the menu but was kind of disappointing be cause it didn't highlight the ham enough.\n\nOverall, good place to go for a night out.

Halfway through our drink I got a call that our table was ready, so we drank up and headed over.  \n\nWe started with a carafe of a great Albarino, Bodegas as Laxas ($22) along with a few small plates.  The simple and incredibly delicious Pa Amb Tomatquet (Catalunya's national snack of toasted bread, tomato and olive oil) and the Jamon Serrano Reserva board.  The tomato bread was $4 and came with two pieces, and the Serrano came with 10 or so pieces of the paper thin cured meat and some accoutrement and cost $9.\n\nOur next course we ordered another carafe of Albarino (guess we should've just gotten the bottle in the first place!), the Pulpo Salad ($9) and the Sardine and Roasted Eggplant Escalivada Toasts ($8).  I really loved the Pulpo Salad with was tender pieces of octopus, cucumbers, pickled lipstick peppers, onions, capers and mint.  Simple clean flavors with great textures.  The sardine toasts were good, if you like sardines (which I do), and had a nice smokiness from the eggplant... it came with 3 toasts each with a sardine fillet laying atop the eggplant.\n\nFor our last course we got a carafe of a Mencia from D Ventura ($28), a delicious red, and ordered the Coca with Gypsy and Red Lipstick Peppers ($14) and the Tripe with Chorizo and Chickpeas ($8).  I loved the tripe dish and had never had tripe before.  The tripe was soft and tender without feeling mushy, the chorizo added a great smokiness and the chickpeas gave it body and depth.  it was a great portion and paired well with the Coca (flatbread) that was delicious and great for sopping up the sauce in the tripe dish.  We added the egg to the flatbread, which is one of my favorite things.  The tripe dish was definitely the best value and portion and was hearty and homey.  Oh, we also ordered another tomato toast with this course, because it was so tasty!\n\nOur server, Andrew was great and made our dining experience so much better more enjoyable.

While set up to encourage community, we find it difficult to hold a conversation due to the noise level and close proximity to other diners. We have learned to set up a reservation on-line because they frequently have a wait list at the door. The waitstaff are great- very friendly and attentive, and always eager to please. All said and done? It's TOTALLY worth it.", "author": "Nani M."}

Their chicken dish was a leg and thigh of chicken with slightly oily and rubbery skin on a tiny portion of parsnip potato mash.

We opened the door to see a petite woman (who, as it turns out was one of the owners Elan) panic stricken on the phone while she punched buttons on a console. \"I'm sorry,\" she mouthed.  We were sorry too and stepped outside to protect our ear drums from being shattered.  \n\nAnthony was bummed; he'd been looking forward to trying out the new place in his 'hood as he'd been to Beretta one too many times of late.  I encouraged him to wait.  By the time calmness descended we pretty much had our pick of the place.  We chose a table at the back next to the windows, which we discovered opened, so we enjoyed a nice balmy breeze.  Our waiter Andrew was very patient and helpful as I tried to find a wine to my liking.  I was not a fan of the Alfrocheiro Blend, but think it would probably go down nicely with some cheese and jamon.  The Cabernet was smooth, but nothing special, and while the Tempranillo was fine, $9.50 is too much for a glass.  The Carinena Blend, Montsant, 2004, was perfect... yeah, I had three of them!\n\nWe loved the Beets and Will's Pixit Tangerine salad.  The Fava Greens Catalan Style were on the bland side.  The Asparagus with mojama was yummy - could have used a bit more green garlic. The fried little fish were a little on the large side, but delicious nonetheless, and on the opposite side the fava pods were so small I thought they were green beans; also could have used a bit more lemon in the mix.  The patatas bravas were outstanding - hands down beats Cha Cha Cha any day!  The lamb and pork meatballs were original and delicious.  The flatbread with wild morels was tasty enough but lacking zing... it could have used a smidge of grated cheese, but Andrew explained it was the only item on the menu that was 100% vegan... \n\nThey gave us a small discount, presumably for either our inconvenience or patience...\n\nAll in all, we give it a solid 2 thumbs up... allowing some room for improvement.  \n\nBy the way, the interior is lovely and I wouldn't mind propping up the bar on a busy night with a glass of wine and some cheese.

It may have been said elsewhere, but the textures and/or tastes of much of what we ordered just didn't work well together.  For instance, the patatas bravas (sp?) featured both a white and a red sauce on them.  Maybe it's my own peculiar sense of order, but wouldn't it have made more sense to have the sauces on the side?  We also had a small plate that was a combination of pickled carrots, almonds, and pickled onions.  Odd mix of textures, no?  One taste combo that actually did work, at least for me, was the flatiron steak with bleu cheese, but the cheese just formed into little balls and sort of rolled around on the steak without truly achieving any kind of unity with it.  And the small plate of clams had sand in it.\n\nI will say that the service was outstanding.  But at the somewhat steep prices at Contigo, I'd ignore the current buzz and go somewhere else, at least until they have the kinks worked out.  For right now, I'd say 2.5 stars..", "author": "moosedog i."}

Although I thought that was a little annoying, I was okay with it. \n\nFirst impression of the restaurant was that it was modern, tasteful and welcoming. It didn't feel like the cookie-cutter restaurants that are continuously popping up, which was a breath of fresh air. After ordering enough food for what seemed like an army, we started on a bottle of wine we ordered. The tapas came out sporadically, giving us plenty of time and table space to enjoy the different flavors. Although nothing blew me away, the food was consistently enjoyable, something not all too common. I went with two people who had actually grown up in Spain, and informed me that the food wasn't necessarily authentic. Some close, others something they'd never heard of until that evening. \n\nAfter about two hours we were ready to pay and leave. It was a bit of a shock when the check came -- none of us were really full, but the total well surpassed $300. I guess that goes to show that things add up quickly. \n\nEven with the overpriced bill, I do see myself going back sometime.

Contigo is exciting.  It inspired me to add a review.  For anyone living in Noe, Bernal, the Castro, Mission, you've got yourself an amazing tapas style restaurant close by.  For everyone else, this is absolutely destination restaurant quality food.  Without a doubt. If they were in Oakland (I live, w/o a car, in Bernal Heights), I'd still go several times a year.\n\nJust to give you an idea of the quality and authenticity of the food, this ranks right up there with places like Batali's Casa Mono in New York, and the multiple terrific local spots in San Sebastian and Barcelona.  The food, I believe, is on that level.  \n\nThree types of ham are served:  serrano, iberico de bellota and Iowa's excellent La Quercia prosciutto.  On a busy Friday night, my fellow diners and I enjoyed a number of 'pica picas':  setas a la plancha (sauteed mushrooms with a parsley pesto); tortilla de hongos (Spanish omelette with black trumpets); croquetas de buey (fried balls of savory, pimenton inflected brisket - delicious, especially with a squirt of the accompanying lemon); a perfectly dressed, piquant chicory salad and a wood fire roasted coca (Catalan flatbread) with radicchio and house made Basque chorizo.\n\nFor a platillo (entree) I had fried skate served over a red pepper sauce.  Tasty but slightly overcooked and stringy.  I love skate, have eaten and cooked it on several occasions, and never have experienced this type of texture.  Anyway, good flavors though.\n\nDesserts looked delicious.  We just had some ice cream - olive oil and chocolate cardamom - the former tasty and the latter a bit gritty from cardamom and cocoa and also a tad icy.\n\nA few other non-food related observations and comments on others' reviews.  To reiterate others' comments, this is a brand new restaurant - be patient.  Timing may be a bit off (ours was perfect up until the entree, where things proceeded to lag).  Servers may not yet know all their stuff (ours did just fine, and was quite personable as well).  Regarding the price, it should not cost you $125/person as one reviewer suggested.  Four of us ate several small plates, had three platillos, shared a bottle of reasonably priced wine and ordered one dessert and tea.  Total including tax and tip was about $50/person.  Even if we had indulged a bit more with food and wine it would have been about $70.  For tapas (especially of this caliber) that's a bargain.  Sorry, when you factor in the currency exchange it's not much cheaper in the best spots in Spain right now.  It's 2009, not 1999.\n\nOne last comment - not a wine geek's wine list.  You're not going to see LdH, wines from Ribera Sacra, multiple types of palo cortado,  Not yet anyway.\n\nIf you are a fan of tapas, check this place out.  You'll probably like it a lot.", "author": "joe m."}

Ever since my first visit to Barcelona two years ago (since followed up by an extended vacation through Spain and another trip to Barcelona just to visit my favorite resto-bar in the world, Cuines Santa Caterina), I have been absolutely in love with Barca's approach to food - simple, fresh, delicious.\n\nI had very high hopes for Contigo and they were mostly met...but I wasn't absolutely wowed by the food. I did love the decor and layout - the multi-level dining room makes the space look bigger and more complex than it really is - basically one large rectangle.\n\nWhat we had:\n\nAsparagus with sieved egg and crispy pancetta: by far the best thing we ate - the asparagus is just barely blanched so you get crunchiness and a burst of fresh flavor.\n\nBacalao fritters: our least favorite of the dishes...just a bit too heavy, a bit too fishy and not that appetizing overall.\n\nKurobota pork bocadillo: a generous slice of ultra-fatty pork and pickled onions on a teeny brioche bun - the buttery savoriness of the pork, the slight tartness of the onions and the slight sweetness of the brioche bun worked really well together. But if you consider the fact that you are paying $7 or $8 for this laughably small \"burger\"....it's just a bit overpriced for what you are getting.\n\nSpanish tortilla with black trumpet mushrooms: as far as Spanish tortillas go, this was a decent version but again...the tiny sized portion compared to the price is disproportionate. Tortilla is essentially poor man's food made of five ingredients: eggs, potatoes, onions, salt and oil. $7-8 for a teeny wedge of this is a bit unjustified. Make your portions bigger Contigo!\n\nCalamari a la plancha: another teeny portion of calamari on a bed of arugula with a red sauce (reminded me of enchilada sauce). Not great, not bad. \n\nPescaditos fritos - when I am in Spain, these tiny fried fish, which I've found in Spain called \"boquerones\" are my favorite tapa. Ducca, although an Italian restaurant, does a very very good version. Contigo's was ok...the fish they use are really a bit too large to be eating whole - you can feel the bones of the fish in your throat which is not entirely pleasant. Usually in Spain the fish are about half the size and the portion is 2 - 3 times as large.\n\nFlatbread with benton bacon and asparagus: Great smoky bacon sliced paper thin, nice chewy flatbread.\n\nContigo is a great addition to the SF dining scene - I'm all for more Catalan or Basque places in the city.

Having had a chance to sample alot of what this place has to offer, I'm in a pretty good position to say that the food is amazing.  Contigo isn't your standard Tapas place.  You could come here just for the cured meats, which range in saltiness/fattiness -- but they're all fantastic.  The restaurant's heart and soul, however, is its wood fired oven, which is used not just for delicious flatbreads, but also to import smoky deliciousness into -- among other things -- tripe with chorizo and chickpeas (not for everyone, but I love it), the pimientos de padron with sea salt, and octopus salad.  There are typical only 3 or 4 \"second\" plates on the menu, but you can't go wrong with any of them. Last night we shared the seared sea bass with summer vegetable safaina, ancho cress and black olive sauce.  This was sophisticated Spanish comfort food --  tremendous depth, multiple levels of flavor.  The olive sauce really balanced out the sweetness that came through the red peppers and tomatoes in the safaina, and the fish was melt-in-your mouth perfect.  \nContigo has an all-Spanish wine list, with lots of stuff by the glass.  If you don't know Spanish wines, don't worry. In addition to being generally excellent servers with a thorough knowledge of the menu, the waitstaff also knows their wines.  \n\nSave room for dessert. You can never go wrong with any of their warm chocolate/churro combinations, but they also do wonders with whatever fruit is in season.  Last night we had an unreal fig-wrapped sweetened ricotta cake (cooked in the wood-fired oven) with local honey and fresh figs.  Light and decadent at the same time.  \n\nContigo is typically pretty packed with Noe/Mission/Glen Park/Casto residents, but I wonder when the rest of the City is going to catch on.  It is not just a neighborhood restaurant -- it's worth getting in the car and making a night of it.", "author": "Andrew E."}

The Suquet de Peix (fish stew) was fantastic, and after devouring it, we decided we had room for another dish. Enter the Coca de Alcachofas (flatbread with artichokes, spinach, and a couple of other ingredients).  Absolutely superb!  However full you might find yourself after your meal, the Churros y Chocolate is a MUST HAVE (after dipping and eating the churros, you must drink the chocolate -- don't be shy). And if you know what's good for you, you will also order the Blood Orange Tart.\n\nService was a bit slow, but not in a deal-breaker way.  They're still getting their sea legs, and everyone was incredibly friendly.\n\nNote that they only take reservations for parties of six or more. We stopped in and asked how long the wait would be, and they said it would be about an hour.

However I won't be going back anytime soon, nor taking my friends there.  About 45 minutes after eating dinner there last night, I was horribly,violently ill. \n\nThat would be bad enough and cause me to steer clear for a while, but when I called to inform them today two things left me with an even worse taste in my mouth.  (pun intended)\n\nFirst, the woman who answered didn't ask what I had eaten - I.e. she was so sure it had nothing to do with *her* restaurant that she wasn't even thinking of doing a safety double-check on their food handling and safety.  Second, when I politely said I would like a refund of the money spent on dinner, she said she \"couldn't do that.\".  When I said that I would like to speak to a supervisor, she hummed and hawed and then offered me a gift certificate.  Now why on earth would I want to go back to somewhere that made me horrible ill? I explained this and said if she did not have authority to offer a refund I would like to speak to someone who did and could I talk to her supervisor. (In case you are wondering, we are only talking about $35.  Not a lot of money.)  At this she started to get an annoyed tone, told me no, I couldn't talk to her supervisor, and that if I didn't want a refund she was going ton hang up on me.  One more round on this, where she accused me of being rude even though I was talking in a perfectly pleasant manner and simply repeating that what I wanted was to talk to whoever did have the \"power\" to refund my money and she ffinally admitted that she herself was the owner!\n  \nEnough said.  Do you want to go somewhere that stands behind their work and will give you a refund if you have any problems, or somewhere that the owner will pretend she is a lowly employee just following orders so that she can keep your money and yet dodge responsibility.\n\n(And for those of you who will want to jump in and say I could have gotten sick off something else, I have been perfectly healthy recently, the only other things I ate yesterday were cold cereal and toast, prepared at home and consumed about 8 hours earlier.  Had felt fine all day.  Started getting nauseous within 30 min of getting home.  After the rest of Contigo's food abruptly exited my body, within ten minutes I was back to feeling fine again.)", "author": "G T."}

Contigo, which means \"with you\" in Spanish, offers a strictly Spanish wine list, and an array of Spanish style small plates, flatbreads and entrees.\n\nWe started with two different Cava's, my favorite was the rose, the Mont Marcal Reserva Brut Rosado 2005. It was tart with a slightly bitter undertone which reminded me a bit of Campari. I'm always a sucker for the pink fizzy drinks, let's be honest. The Sanstrave \"e\", Gran Reserva was also sampled. Not pink, but a bit less dry than the first. Both unique and refreshing.\n\nOnto the small plates. Starting with the Esparragos-Asparagus with Jamon chips, green garlic and sieved egg, the Octopus, and the potatoes with chorizo and onion. We also ordered a flatbread with asparagus, crispy bacon and a farm egg on top for good measure. The flatbread was the highlight of the meal for me. They have a large wood-fired oven in the front of the restaurant, and the flatbread and egg on top were cooked to perfection. The asparagus was still brightly verdant and the bacon was delightfully salty and crisp. \n\nThe octopus was good, though could have used a bit more acid (that seems to be my normal complaint) some sort of citrus or vinaigrette to compliment the flavors. We ended with the sheep's milk cheese which was extraordinarily soft, stinky and went very well with the hazelnuts it was served with.\n\nAll in all this is a fun place with the friendliest service I've encountered in San Francisco. My friend and I remarked to each of the staff members we came in contact with that they were all a pleasure and made us feel very welcome.

Atmosphere, vibe, look was all very good.  A little bit on the expensive side for even high-end tapas.  Anyway, on with the review.\n\nThis is basically a fancy tapas place.  Went with my friend George and we were both starving after workouts and ready to eat a LOT.\n\nWe started off with a taste test between jamon serrano ($9) and jamon iberico ($21).  OK, $21 is a lot for a couple of slices of cured ham.  But it sure is delicious.  The iberico is more like a ribeye or kobe, super fatty and melt in your mouth.  The serrano is more like a ny strip, much meatier taste.  Both are great.  George preferred serrano, I preferred iberico.  But I'll prob get my iberico from Bi-rite next time.\n\nThe small tapas are $7 if you get 3 or more.  We got, in order of deliciousness:\n\n2 orders of oxtail croquettas (these are AMAZING rich croquettes, DELICIOUS)\nsnap peas and mushrooms (delicious, but you know, peas and mushrooms...)\npatatas bravas (delicious fried potatoes with OK sauce)\nbutter beans w/ chorizo/pig's ear/trotter (basically fancy pork and beans, except with a FRIED PIG EAR ON TOP, pretty solid)\nand the only real letdown\nalbondigas - very bland meatballs that were lukewarm, not seasoned, and a little undercooked\n\nSo, including the jamons, that was 8 total small items.  6 small or 4 small + 1 large is probably the right amount for 2 people.\n\nPlenty of good by the glass wine selections, and knowledgeable servers on both food and wine.\n\nFor dessert we had churros con chocolate (thick hot chocolate).  Delicious.  One order is definitely plenty for two.  George of course forgot the size of the order and insisted that we had to get two orders.  I suspected something was up when the waiter said in a very surprised voice, TWO ORDERS!?  The chocolate is great, the churros are pretty good, but not great.  A little too much sugar caked on them for me, but maybe I'm biased because I had to stuff down four of them.\n\nWe ordered way too much, but normal dinner here with a couple of glasses of wine each and dessert/coffee will prob run about $60.  A little on the pricey side for what you get, but not too bad.  Overall, I'd say I'm pretty neutral on this place.

At any one time, we had no idea 1) who our server was and 2) where they were. 4 of our tapas came out at once, and then one took quite awhile longer -- we were left with scraps of bread and dregs of wine -- not a pretty sight. When we asked a passing waiter where our final dish was he said \"Oh, we don't want too many things on the table\". Umm....ok. On top of that, the table next to us seemed to be friends of the chef or owner or something -- waiters/waitresses were super attentive to their party. \nAnyway, here's the run down on the dishes we had: \n\n1) Lamb skewers: well seasoned, juicy, but way too small - I know, tapas are supposed to be bite size, but this was not worth it.\n2) Jamon serrano reserva: Good, but hard to screw up.

We had to ask twice for a few slices of bread.\n3) Pescaditos: delicious, crunchy little fish -- this was probably the best part. \n4) Lengua: good, but it took forrrrrrrrever and it was a cold dish. \n\nWine list was good - interesting variety. \n\nOverall, they need to step up their service and figure out how to pace dishes a bit better.", "author": "Kate T."}

Maybe it's some super-regional specialties they focus on? It's definitely a place to share plates (so come with a lot of people to taste everything).\n\nMenu: The type of menu that immediately makes you want to try everything. Dishes are well-described and the combination of ingredients is really tempting.\n\nService: Knowledgeable, polite, just-right. Complimentary sparkling water brought to the table, great recommendations about dishes to try and amount of food. Top-notch.\n\nDecor: Cool! Lots of cool touches everywhere. Uber-modern, but lots of warmth from natural wood and natural light from the backyard (covered) patio. They make a lot from a small space. Great little touches like the tableware, the open kitchen, even the restroom.\n\nFood: Delicious. (Note that I didn't say mind-bending or earth-moving, but pretty darn tasty across the board.) Everything pretty much lived up to the expectations set by the server and the menu. A few items I remember:\n-Sardine toasts: huge winner\n-Asparagus soup: very nice, but not the end-all\n-Goat cheese salad: tasty\n-Roasted cauliflower: as good as anyplace I've tried\n-Salt-cod fritters: tasty\n-Imported ham: superb - the real deal, but crazy $$$$.\n-Housemade orange soda: skip it\n\nWines: Spanish-only. I needed a lot of help deciphering the list! Thankfully our server was pretty well-versed in the different regions, varietals, etc. The wine we got was quite good, but by-the-glass prices are too high.\n\nValue: OK. We left not-quite-full at $50/person (and only half of us drank wine). Quality and decor were suited to the prices, but portion sizes were too small. I think the tasting menu would have been a better value.\n\nOverall: We had a very nice time and we'll definitely come back.", "author": "Al M."}

I would have given more stars on account of the food but as an overall experience I just give it a 3.\nFirst of all the greeters/Maitre d's need to lighten up both times they have been overly rude with their needless grandiosity/overly fake interest in you, and you feel like your going through a vetting process to come in, and surprisingly this happened on two occasions with two different people.\nWhen you sit down and see the menu in Catalan, Castilian and English.... where are we going with this we wondered, we all know two of those dont mix :)....\nBack to the food with wafer thin slices of the ruby red wonder which is jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico de bellota, arguably the greatest item of food in the world to the alb\u00f3ndigas, fideu\u00e0 with txistorra, and chocolate con churros all very very good, but this is a Spanish restaurant and yes we like bread with our food and we don't want to be rushed and we want you to bring the food in the right way.  As we sat finishing, we thought on a cold foggy SF morning, Chocolate con Churros would be the perfect treat but this place is only open in the evening.

Once on a weeknight when it was not crowded and the staff was attentive and the food better than average. At that point, we thought it was a solid three stars with a potential for a fourth if it could maintain consistency in future visits. The wine list Includes some unusual choices and we found an inexpebsive gem from Portugal that we now stock at home as well. \nThat brought us to our second visit in the hopes that Contigo would become a neighborhood gem and earn it's fourth star.  We came around 9 on a Saturday night with a reservation. The place was packed but we were seated right away -- a big plus in my book.  Then things began to go a bit sideways.  The waitress informed us that the kitchen was out of both rabbit legs and octopus (two of the most appetizing choices on the menu).  OK, regrettable but it happens.  So we order two appetizers and two main courses.  The Jamon Iberica is delicious but of course the same as the one I order on line and not a tribute to the kitchen. The crab salad included good size chunks of crab and was well dressed.  So far so good. The trout skin was crispy and the seasonal Brussel sprouts and hazelnuts as a bed to the trout were tasty and well prepared. Then one of the staff stopped by to tell us that they ran out of the mushroom entree we had ordered an hour ago!  There was a vague sort of apology but nothing approaching the level of contrition I would have expected.  No offer to comp a different entree or anythingfor that matter.  These are the momenta that make or break restaurants, especially small neighborhood restaurants in a highly competitive environment.  And here Contigo's management failed miserably. There wasn't another main course worth ordering.  So I just asked for a big helping of the cheese course. Out came a meager offering of cheese and insuffficient bread -- not even warm bread at that.  Goodbye extra star and no choice but to drop Contigo down to two stars despite better than average food. \nUnless Contigo gets a better handle on customer service in a business that is not just about food but about how you make people feel when they eat that food, I would joy expect them to last another year. \nWe won't be back.", "author": "Sweet B."}

We got the Pica-pica (sardinas fritas, patatas a la riojana y callos madrilenos), coques (coca amb pernil), and judiones a la segoviana. This was plenty for three and quite delicioso.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-30", "description": "We first went to Contigo only a week after they opened. It was our first taste of tapas in a long time, and it was a fabulous, table-pounding experience (not that we actually pounded the table). I always thought tapas were small plates that left you hungry. Contigo's tapas are small, but they are quite satisfying (unless you're a glutton). The secret is their freshness: the flavors seep out of every bite; their apparent simplicity belies their skillful execution. They date the menu, too, so you know it's not a predictable list.\n\nContigo is popular, so get there early if you want a table without waiting for it. On our first visit, on a Saturday around 8 PM, the wait for a table was 40 minutes but the counter was free, so we took it. On our second visit, on a Tuesday at 6, we specifically asked for the counter even though we could have sat anywhere. If you're just two people, by all means opt for the counter: the kitchen is right there and so much fun to watch -- not because it's chaotic but because it's so quiet. Your food is prepared calmly right in front of you -- and handed to you right over the glass partition. Such service!\n\nAs you can see from glancing at the kitchen, and the menu, the ingredients are local and very fresh. The (red and golden) Beets and Pixie Tangerines were a juicy combination, complemented by chopped almonds, arugula, and a dab of smooth ricotta. The Sardine and Avocado Toasts from their wood oven were a revelation: mouthwatering fish atop smooth, buttery avocado (which I normally dislike) and crisp toasts that did not completely fall apart when bitten. Gambas al Ajilloo were garlicky and generously sized Florida white shrimp, whose sauce was worth the price of another order of artisanal bread just for dipping into. Albondigas were tender lamb and pork meatballs served on a delicious puree of almond garlic ajo blanco. \n\nThese four \"pica-pica\" dishes ($8 each or $7 when ordering three or more) and two glasses of Cava (the complex Raventlos i Blanc, $9, and the rose-colored Mont Marcal, $8) were enough to fill us without denting our wallet too much -- and still left room for two desserts: Barcelona-style hot chocolate with crisp churros and a tangy lemon tart with caramelized sugar on the top.\n\nThe tab came to $62 -- steep, yes, but it was really delicious food served with attentiveness and care. Although we noticed on our recent trip to Barcelona that Cava is much less expensive in Spain, we didn't find any tapas dishes there that compare to the quality, fresh local produce, and meats that create the tapas at Contigo. Contigo serves up special, tasty plates using locally sourced ingredients in a relaxed atmosphere. Plus, any restaurant that says on its menu that it's closed May 1st in observance of International Workers' Day knows how to treat its workers right.", "author": "Stefan G."}

The luscious little treats were so crispy on the outside, and when you cut into them, the Mahon just ooozes out. YUM!! I absolutely adored the Sardinas Fritas presentation in the little sardine tin. Fantastic Chocolate Caliente con Churros for dessert. The sea salt was a nice touch! \n\nThumbs tilting downward on the seating/no reservations.

At 8:45, friends in tow, we were told another 30 minutes. Left a cell number and went home for a glass of wine. We called at 9:30 to check in and were told another 20 to 30 minutes. Walked back and were seated close to 10pm. Thoughtfully, they gave us a glass of Cava to pass the last 15 minutes, and swore they'd never seat three large parties simultaneously again. \n\nLike I said, they're still working out the kinks, but I am sure they'll successfully figure it out.

We checked in at 8:30PM and were told the wait would be an hour.  We went to a nearby bar where we were called at 9:45PM and told that our table was ready.  When we got there, it was actually a bar seat available (there were 3 of us) so we waited for a table (another 15+ minutes).  Okay, no big deal, this place is beautiful inside and we were excited for the experience! \n\nBut, as soon as we sat down our waiter came over and asked us to order right away because the kitchen would be closing at 10.  Um, excuse me?  First of all, it was now 10:05 PM, and we just waited well over an hour for a seat!  Our evening was just starting!! If they couldn't accommodate us in the time their kitchen was open, they should have told us to dine elsewhere as opposed to taking our name and having us wait!\n\nAdditionally, because the menu is tapas, its nice to order over the course of your meal as opposed to all at once.  Anyway, we did not cop any attitude, and did some ordering.  The food was generally good.  I would say the shrimp special was a bit bland, the gem salad just fair but the arugala salad, the albondigas, the vegetarian ratatouille and the duck was very good.  The portions were too small. I mean really.  I did appreciate the sparkling water on tap! That was nice.\n\nHowever, even very good food and nice water cannot increase my star rating.     \n\nAfter our food came OUR WAITER NEVER CAME BACK TO OUR TABLE.  EVER.  We saw him take a seat at the bar, eat his dinner and talk and laugh with the other staff.  Mind you, the restaurant was still FULL of patrons, so it wasn't like we were the last people there.  We had finished a bottle of wine, finished all of our food and NO ONE came to check on us.  We had intended to order more food, more wine, but literally it was like we weren't even in the restaurant!\n\nI finally flagged (after a number of attempts) a bus-boy and asked him for another salad and my friend ordered another drink.  Twenty minutes after that, we flagged someone else down to ask for dessert menus.  \n\nTo top all of this off, two of the owner and/or managers (they seemed like a couple) came to sit at the table next to us and have their dinner.  They kept looking around the restaurant, seemingly oblivious to the horrible service we were receiving. I nearly leaned over and said something!\n\nDuring the time we were attempting to order dessert, we saw our waiter put on his sweater, and leave the restaurant.  He did walk right by our table when he did this, and did say goodbye to the owner/managers sitting next to us.  He never once came over to tell us he was leaving, or that someone else would be finishing serving us.  \n\nMaybe for some folks, a $150 dinner is no big deal - a weekly thing.  For us, going to Contigo was a special treat.  We went to celebrate a happy occasion.  We don't appreciate being treated so poorly at a place that, at this point, should be far more attentive and geared toward patron service. \n\nAlthough its not upscale food, we get better service across the street at Hahn's Hibachi for a fraction of the price.  Or, if we want something nicer, FireFly is tried and true. \n\nI am a loyal Noe resident who loves to support my local spots but will NEVER go back to this restaurant again!", "author": "L S."}

I stepped next store to The Peaks for a quick cocktail (as they serve only beer and wine) I came back in about 20 minutes and was told it would be another 20 or 30 minutes.  Still decide to wait.  After 40 minutes making my total wait time a little over an hour I was finally seated. Note, I was by myself and they were obviously more interested in seating the numerous couples waiting as a couple who entered after I did was seated before me.  The hostess was very pleasant but as I said to her I know you have only been open a week and I am sure your working out the kinks but you need to be more realistic about your seating wait times.  She did at one point during my wait give me some toasted Almonds to chew on while I waited however, a glass of house wine might have made the wait a little more bearable.  Well now I am finally seated and having read the menu about 20 times front to back had decided on my food selection.  I had originally planned to do a few small plates but since it was now near 10 o'clock I opted to just have a glass of wine and one large plate as I thought it would arrive pretty quickly as it was getting late and the restaurant was now beginning to empty.  I chose the judiones a la segoviana for my entr\u00e9e which was pork belly, ears, feet with butter beans and the waiters wine recommendation of a ros\u00e9 from Spain.  It was quite delicious!

It's a small place but I like the set up.  There are 2 small bar-seating areas and little nooks for normal tables.  There's a bigger table area in the back and also an outdoor area.  Everything is clean and bright and open.  Service was excellent:  very friendly and helpful and on point.  Food was pretty good.  I really loved the flatbread and egg/potato/sausage  dishes and all the pork dishes (jamon serrano, albondigas, etc).  I definitely want to try the dishes we didn't order, so maybe next time!  The one negative was the dessert.... the xocolata calenta was described as \"thick\" but it was kinda watery and thin... we used it to dip our xurros in it.  But then again, it IS hot chocolate, maybe we were supposed to drink the rest?  It gets pricy when you order a lot, but looking at it, the prices are fair and the portions are fitting.", "author": "Easter E."}

My girlfriend and I showed up at 8:30pm, and they said they wouldn't have a table till 9pm. While we went next door for a glass of wine, they called us at 9 exactly and held a table for us. Wow! Later on, after absolutely delicious food and exotic wine, a third girlfriend joined us, and no one said a word about her simply joining us at a two-person table. She was instantly welcome, with no fuss. FOOD: the flat bread with nettles is to die for. Being from NYC, I am extremely picky about my pizza, which is really what this bread is, and it was spectacular. Their huevos estrellados and moorish lamb tagine were exquisite. Very flavorful and well-balanced. Btw, the olive oil that comes with the bread is phenomenal. Although, I may have to say that the bread could be better. That's the only little 'but' I can come up with for this place, but I wouldn't take even a half star off for that as it's just a nuance I'm sure they'll eventually improve. I think you may have to ask for bread, though. I didn't see the check, so not sure if one has to pay for it. A major plus also is their very knowledgeable wine guy/bartender. Now, I know my wine, and he was able to carry an intelligent discussion about Spanish wine, and most sommeliers miserably fail at Rioja/Priorat-Garnacha/Tempranillo task.

I spotted a friend, went over to say hello, my friend and I reviewed the menu and chatted.  We waited for about 15 minutes.\n\nBeing someone who works with the industry I saw there was trouble.  Five tables with menus open, people looking at the kitchen wondering if food was coming and a service staff that did not look like they had it together.  We decided to leave.\n\nHaving read reviews (and really wanting to try this restaurant) I knew who the owner was as he was in the kitchen.  I went up to him and told him we were leaving and why.  Of course he apologized, and his excuse was \"we are short staffed.\"\n\nRestaurant management 101:  If you are short staffed, close off a section.  If the kitchen is running behind, have your hostess stop seating until you catch up.  Restraurant psychology 101...a server should appear at a table within 3-5 minutes of a table being seated, even if it is to say, \"Hi there...we are really busy this evening.  I will be with you in just a few minutes.\"\n\nAlso, on a hot summer day, if you have a patio, open up the plastic...that is why there is a patio.\n\nAs we were leaving, there was a line.  People were walking in, and of course, there was no hostess to be found.\n\nIt's a shame the evening turned out the way it did as I was looking forward to dining at Contigo.

I've been here multiple times and my favorites on the menu are the charred asparagus with poached egg, the tostadas and of course the jam on iberico! The food yesterday was the only saving grace. We were seated outside and they don't have any ability to regulate the heating- it was either freezing or we felt like we were sitting in a sauna. Towards the end, as we were finishing our meal, we saw a RAT scuttling around near our table! For the last 15 mins of our meal, the rat kept us company near our table.

I couldn't even remember when I threw it back up a few hours later. I wish I could because then I would know what made me sick! That said, the flan was pretty good. Can you screw up flan though really? All in all, it was a small amount of unremarkable food for pretty high prices.\n\nI wanted to give it 3 stars, but I had to knock one off for the service. It was hipster crap. I swear, I think they might have hired their servers from the Hipster Olympics rejects. They seemed to be more concerned with fostering their \"ironic\" facial hair than anything else. And their \"ironic\" choice of music was utter crap. It was the sort of stuff that has been turned into instrumental versions and was played on my grandmother's radio station in the early 90's. Madonna's \"Take a Bow?\" Really? That's not even ironic, it's just bad, especially for a supposedly new, wanna-be-hip restaurant. When I asked about it, one of the hipster bartenders just gave me a long dirty look. By the way, are you really a bartender if you just open wine? Just asking.\n\nAnyway, like I said, I really wanted to like this place, but I'd rather head over the bridge to Barlata in Oakland for better Catalonian tapas, larger portions, lower prices, and just a better experience all around.", "author": "Alex D."}

We arrived around 10pm and waited in the entryway with glasses of the Pares Balta brut cava. If you know me at all, you are probably aware that trying new restaurants and drinking cava are a few of my favorite things. The clean lines, cool green tones, and quaint size of the dining room give it the perfect eco-chic balance of a room that would be at home in Sunset, me gusta.\n\nA group vacated some seats at the back bar for us where we ordered a spritzy dry white Txakolina (a great Basque wine) and an assortment of small dishes. We started with the simple and earthy setas a la plancha (grilled wild mushrooms) with pounded parsley. These were soon ignored when the patatas a la riojana (potatoes stewed with chorizo) arrived. Although we had thought about ordering the more typical patatas bravas, these soft and silky potatoes were served with a lucious sauce that we guarded to dip our flatbread crusts in. The sauce had the broken-down starch of the patatas, the richness of the chorizo fat, and a hint of sweetness that was quite delicious. Next up was a jamon coca (flatbread with serrano ham and cheese). This was also a simple combination of top notch ingredients that we mainly ordered to add some heft to our meal, but were happy to have the crusts to dip in the aforementioned sauce. Jamon Serrano is always delicious, no?\n\nAnd b/c it wouldn't be fair to leave without trying a large plate, we also got the pork belly, trotters, and ears with white beans. I have a special fondness for pork belly and trotters and for white beans. That being said, the large plate portion did not seem generous for the price (b/c we all know how much the feet and ears cost). I wasn't really into the ears either, the cartilage was crunchy in a mildly off-putting way. The tiny trotter bites (there were only a few of them) and belly meat were savory and worth battling over with our forks.\n\nWe closed out with the chocolate con churros which were merely ok, but we felt like getting a good grasp of the menu and we were celebrating after all. Service made a good effort despite it being the opening week with eager crowds of late night diners. Contigo is a much needed and perfect addition for a neighborhood that is somewhat barren of reliable yet interesting dining choices.", "author": "Candice L."}

Oh yeah, the sample of wine they served me when I ordered a glass of wine.

Three of us ate for about $105 (without tip including the glass of wine) but departed hungry and uninspired. I doubt if I will return. I don't know what my dinner companions thought of the place because none of us discussed our experience.

They were very, very  spicy.  I asked the waitress what was in it besides the garlic and parsley listed and she informs us that there's cayenne pepper in them.  So I'm wondering why wasn't that listed on the menu.  For the entree the waitress said it was a combo of shrimp and scallops.  I asked to doubt check because I'm allergic to fish.  Well. we found out that the dish has \"shrimp and tiliapa\" not \"shrimp and scallops\" as the waitress thought....so we decided to go with the Shrimp Ceviche.  This was even spicier than the mushroomsl.  Again, I asked the waitress and she said the \"owner\" said there was vinegar and garlic.  Sorry.  I've tried many different cuisines and found some spicy and some not.  The menu didn't reveal what it had in it.  Now to be fair, my husband can eat East Indian cuisine and i cannot. I  find it hot, whereas he doesn't.  By the same token, I can eat Thai,  no problem and my husband finds it very spicy.  To each his own, I guess.  Bottom line, i think they should be up front about the ingredients in their food and their patrons decide if they want to try something \"hot\".

The decor reminds me a lot of La Mar; simple but bold colors. I chose the indoor area but, on one of those random warm nights in SF, the patio area would be the place to be. Since I had just finished a midday Bikram yoga class, I was ravenous! I had a hard time deciding because my stomach wanted something... anything... Upon the suggestion of my friend, we ordered 2 of the pork belly sliders (so good you don't wan to share) and the potatoes with chorizo. The sliders were awesome. I had a bad run in with thick cut pork belly at Burma Superstar so I was hesitant to try it again. Contigo set me straight. It was the perfect balance of pork belly, onions, and bread. The next item we ordered were the  potatoes and chorizo. It was tasty, not fabulous, and I would probably pick another menu item over it on future visits. \nFor the main entree we had the soupy rice which was awesome. It seems as if lately sunny side up eggs are finding there way into more and more dishes and the soupy rice is no exception. The egg married perfectly with the rice, fresh veggies and broth. It was a simple dish, but it was well made and tasty.

On a whim my bf and I decided to swing by on our way home for work.  We got there right as they opened and surprisingly were the only ones there for quite some time.\n\nI really love the decor - always a plus - specifically the lights that were draped at different heights.  I wasn't a fan of the fabric on the banquettes however, but on to more important things...\n\nWe were only planning to have a drink and a small plate or two, but of course became overly excited when we saw the menu and ordered 4 different plates.  We started with one of the sheep's milk cheeses.  We were both impressed by the substantial serving size and enjoyed the bit of quince jam and hazelnuts served alongside.  Very good cheese at that.  We then had the little gem salad served with yummy, sweet, pinkish beets and fried garlic.  The combo of the beets, garlic and a really vinegary-lemony dressing was delicious.  Next was the calamari served with padron peppers.  For some reason I didn't read the menu carefully and thought it was served on some form of bread, but it wasn't - it was just marinated, possibly slightly grilled calamari served with the peppers but the combination of flavors was delicious, and the calamari was cooked perfectly.  Again, the lemony-olive oil sauce was a great addition.  Finally, we got the pork meatballs.  I don't eat pork typically, but I've been feeling adventurous lately and tried some.  They were much more subdued in flavor compared to the rest of the meal, and at first I wasn't blown away.  I almost even gave my meatball to my bf.  However, as I continued to eat it really grew on me - it was almost a soothing, warm sort of comfort food that became more appealing the more I ate.\n\nAll in all a great little meal/snack.  I was full enough not to have dinner, but the boy definitely is ready for a second dinner now.  Also had a nice Rose with my meal.  The server was super friendly and didn't push more food on us when we told him we only wanted a few appetizers.  \n\nOne last note - check out the bathroom - my grandma always said you could tell the quality of a restaurant by the cleanliness/design of the bathroom.  Contigo certainly wins on this point.   It may even deserve 5 stars, but I think I need to try some more of their food before I can make that call!", "author": "Sarah F."}

This is very much a Catalan experience - so please leave your visions of Madrid-style tapas firmly at the door.  The menu changes very often, so it is a little hard to predict your experience.  But, every experience I've had here has been pretty darn amazing, with only the odd dish or two not completely living up to the expectations set by others.  Service is brilliant with the plates timed perfectly to ensure you're not overwhelmed with food at your table (the danger of tapas-style dining).  The albondigas (meatballs in tomato sauce) are almost always on the menu and excellent every time, although there is sometimes a variation in the spicing of the sauce (likely to match the current season).  There is a great collection of either house cured or imported premium hams and salumi for that true Spanish touch.  Any of the cured or cooked seafood specialities have been to die for, in my opinion.  They also have a great, reasonable wine list, but definitely ask for help in navigating it as there are few on the list that are familiar to most wine drinkers.

I will, however, handicap this review since they just opened and are probably working out some kinks.\n\nEach of the small dishes is $8, $21 for 3 dishes. You can also order main dishes which are between $12-$19. Here's what we ordered:\n\n- Calamares - portion was very small, a bit of spicy red sauce and it seemed very fresh\n- Oxtail croquette - nice presentation for 2 croquettes but the flavor of the oxtail itself was bland, it didn't seem to have any spices to make it taste interesting\n- Chicken soup - after being told that there is actually no chicken meat in the soup, I decided to order it anyway. There were bits of chorizo or sausage in the soup which tasted quite nice, but I literally only had about 1/2 cup of soup which was lukewarm. again a very small portion.\n- Sausage hamburger - the hamburger was small (see the theme?) and burnt. There was not much flavor since the meat was overcooked. For the price of around $12 it was unsatisfying\n- Flatbread with manchego, arugula and ham. the portion size was small again, i think this was about $14 and it was about 7\" in diameter, could barely taste any cheese and they skimped on the serrano\n- Fish stew - I counted 5 clams, 4 chunks of fish, 6 chunks of potato and a small amount of broth. $17\n\nThe service was very nice, and the atmosphere was great - not too loud. comfortable, open space.  But, the food was lacking. Our total bill was around $140 for 4 people. We left feeling hungry. I really want to like this place but I can't recommend it for the food at this point. Also,  there was used lipstick on one of the water glasses.\n\nAnother CON:  They charge for bread, and we were 5 people, they brought out 4 slices, we asked for more so each person could get at least one piece, they brought out another basket of 4 slices - and charged us TWICE - nickel and diming customers for bread, which costs almost nothing is not acceptable when you're paying so much for the entrees and starters.", "author": "Spoon G."}

Even though the stomach freaked us both out, we ate most of it (well, until we asked the waiter what tripe is).. and I was dipping my flatbread crusts into that yummy tomato sauce until it was all gone.\n\nThe restaurant has a warm and inviting ambiance and is lively but not overly loud.  My friend and I sat on the back patio which was heated and SO wonderful.  The service is friendly.. our waiter was so nice, though wasn't the fastest, especially toward the end.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's probably an amateur.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Highly recommend the tasting menu, especially if you are only going with one other person.  We had: \n-  wood oven roasted monterey sardine and avocado toast with pickled onions and smoked salt  (great start!)\n-  little gem salad with roasted beets, garlic chips, mint and sherry mustard vinagreta (mint was such a great addition - delicious)\n-  charred asparagus with mojama (cured tuna), pimenton almonds and an olive oil fried farm egg (this was one of my favorites - the charred flavor of the asparagus, the saltiness of the tuna and the crunchy nuttiness of the almonds on top of the olive oil fried egg - yummy)\n-  wood oven roasted spring calcot onions with salvitxada sauce (no idea what the sauce was, but it was delicious)\n-  calamars a la planxa with arros negre, fava beans, chorizo, alioli and guindilla chile oil (another winner - amazing flavors)\n-  sauted greens with toasted almonds, golden raisins and garlic (great with the steak)\n-  seared flat ion steak with rosemary papas fritas,  sauce and crumbled cheese. (perfectly medium rare and tender)\n\nThe \"arros negre\" that came with the calamari was like a squid ink risotto.  The whole dish was amazing, but my favorites were the vegetable dishes.  I really love places that can make a dish with just vegetables so amazingly delicious and completely satisfying.  \n\nCounter seating is great - I think I might prefer that to a table.  4/5 stars because the server didn't do a very good job of explaining all of the dishes.

We had a selection of tapas (calamari, small gem salad, anchovies, croquetas de rabo de toro -- oxtail), jamon serrano, basque sausage/escarole flatbread, the pork belly (crispy/fatty/salty/wonderful), and the steelhead.  All were superb.  Delicious!  The sauce on the calamari was exquisite.\n\nThey were quite gracious about making room for our toddler (though it's clear that despite its Noe Valley location, it's not the most child-suited -- there were, however three infants in the restaurant when we were there).   \n\nRe: Service -- once we were seated it was good.  There were no posted hours on the door, so we walked in when we thought it was open (at 5) and were ignored (one female server walked past us three times without acknowledging our presence) for 10 minutes at which point we asked someone behind the counter if they were still closed  (answer: yes) and then went  for a walk for 15 minutes. However once the hostess was there, she was very accommodating.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive (and he made very good recommendations to suit our tastes).\n\nThe deliciousness of the food and the subsequent great service and the fact that they have only been officially open for 2 days helped us to forgive the earlier service faux pas and elevates our overall rating to a five.  So glad to have this new addition to our neighborhood and city!", "author": "A S."}

I decided to take my parents for my birthday dinner on a Saturday night. I was concerned it could be a little loud for them since it is a small space, and the last time I ate here it was noisily buzzing (in a good way!).  But luckily that night seemed to be \"date night\", meaning there were quiet couples everywhere. Therefore, Contigo is lively enough for a group out for drinks and tapas, yet small enough for an intimate party of 2 or 3 diners.\nI love the first moment of walking into the restaurant and seeing the line of (extremely hot) chefs all diligently putting together dishes. Seems like a dream job with the open kitchen. The kitchen is so rustic with the open oven and all the hanging copper pans. The extremely nice hostess took us to our seat outside, which was nice if you are looking for a quieter noise level. It was really nostalgic of eating outside in my home garden, especially with all the garden plants growing in the small boxes. \nService was only okay because we seemed to be a last table seated during out hostess' shift, so she seemed tired, and I understand how that can be, but it was a tad uncomfortable. \nI always get excited about the seasonal flatbreads here. The manchego cheese and summer squash was sooo good. Sardines with avocado on toast are a must here........ we ordered two.....! Make sure to get a side of Patas Bravas with traditional Romesco sauce to share as well. \nI think the best way to order is to share everything, and the tapas were much more memorable than the main courses, especially because it's all about the sharing, and sharing makes the meal more enjoyable. \nI think I will keep returning to Contigo, for the food... annnnd also to see the line of chefs again!", "author": "Alexandra a."}

There's a lot of staff walking around but no one is taking charge.

I hate writing negative reviews about new places, but I'm so disappointed that I feel I have to. My friends and I went here tonight and we were all very, very disappointed. Yes, the interior was tastefully designed, as everyone commented, but the food (in all of our opinions), as well as the service, was seriously lacking. To begin with, the mushrooms were soggy and tasted *terrible* (as evidenced by the entire plate that we left). There was absolutely no taste - among the kinder descriptions, we said it tasted as if you were eating something when you have a cold and can taste nothing....The patatas bravas were tasty, but they were incredibly stingy on the red sauce (which is such a key part!). The other veggies were ok, but the portions were so small that we all left STARVING...in spite of a bill of $120!! So completely overpriced for the size and value! To top it all off, they did everything but ask us to leave once we had paid our bill, in spite of the fact that we hadn't yet finished our wine. Overall, we were very unimpressed. I've been to Barcelona numerous times, and this doesn't come close.

She'd read a blog by some guy she often agrees with about Contigo so of course we had to go.   We ordered a lot of food.  The salads, fish/seafood and mostly veggie dishes were the best.  I thought the anchovies were overpriced and were not anything special (I've had homemade anchovies elsewhere and they are great).  I thought the tripe, pork belly and frito polo was a little bland (beans with the pork were delicious though) and probably should have been served earlier in the meal because by the time these meat dishes were served (last), we'd already eaten everything else and were pretty full.  Note, all the food is grown locally so it's not going to be exactly like what you get in Spain.  O, but the rest of the food is so nicely flavored and tasty.

The staff can help you wade through the unfamiliar wine list. Service was steady and gracious for us. The prices seem appropriate to what you are getting, which is a unique dining experience.

As a Noe resident, I am always surprised at how limited the good food options are in the 'hood.  Contigo is a welcome addition.  We went with some friends tonight & were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and service.  Below is a recap of what dishes we had:\n\n*Anchoas del Cantabrico:  Anchovies - nice & salty\n* Calamares al la Plancha: Squid with Harissa - a really tasty dish, highly recommend it.  The squid is cooked perfectly and the harissa gives it that extra kick.\n* Rejomon: Salted cod citrus salad - overall a disappointment.  It fot a lot of rave reviews on the site, and I was really expecting to be wowed but was not.  The salt cod was over powered by the dressing and citrus.\n* Croquetas del Rabo de Toro: Beef (ox tail) fritter - absolutely delicious & a must.  When I read the description was unsure, but our waiter highly recommended this tasty deep fried ball of deliciousness.  \n* Patatas a la Riojana: stewed potatoes with chorizo - another winner, the potatoes soak up the flavor of the chorizo\n* Bikini: grilled cheese and ham - who doesn't like a hot sandwich.\n* Jamon Iberico de Bellota - so this is the $31 ham, tasty.  Glad I tried it since I have read so much about it.  Very good, but unless you are are BIG foodie - the Serrano would be just as good\n* Coca del Alachofas - OK - my friends really liked it more than me\n* Pork belly with ears & feet - delicious and the beans are AMAZING.\n\nFor dessert we had the churros with the chocolate sauce - just OK.  We also had the cheese sampler - the cheeses were terrific.\n\nOverall - the next visit - I am definitely getting the beef croquette, the stewed potatoes, pork belly, and squid again.

It is what I would call \"california\" tapas.  Everything arrived on small plates, true, but it seemed to lack alot of the spanish, basque and catalonian flavors and styles that I expected from a tapas restaurant named Contigo. Had a REALLY interesting white wine that taste and smelled like blue cheese (in a good way). The \"flatbread\" was basically just a thin crust pizza and the salads were decent.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing to get excitied about either.  The experience just kind of washed over me.  If you are impressed by a $36 cured meats appetizer that was sliced  from a vegan pig that was feed acorns and evian water, then aged for 36 years at at 45 degree angle .... Contigo is a safe bet.

HUH? so i know most people woulda been pissed and left...but i wanted to see how this was gonna play out. we waited another 1/2 hour, finally got a table and the food was... just ok...didn't live up to the hype and it's NOT gonna be good enough to come back a second time. i thought the service was great...alisa totally went out of her way to take care of us before we got a table...so come to find out that they were holding that 4 top table for Devin's parents. ok...i know you don't take reservations... but if you tell us the table is being help for your family, i can accept that...but to LIE and then not call us and to add insult to hunger, they seat another party of 4 before us (i'm pretty sure we were there before them!!)...DUDE!! are you kidding me!! service was great but totally left a bitter taste and i will not be going back....and if it were me, i woulda comped us at least a dish...but no such courtesy...try andalu or piqueos for tapas...one guys opinion!", "author": "Chris M."}
