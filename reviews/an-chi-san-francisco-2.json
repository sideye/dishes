Never been inside physically but I ordered through UberEats and I thought the food was pretty good. Now, I'm Vietnamese and I know what authentic Vietnamese tastes like. I live and breathe Vietnamese food. And, I can be a tough critic when it comes to my origin's food but when I ordered takeout here, I was willing to give it a shot knowing it won't be exactly how I would imagine for it to be but if it can replicate some Vietnamese flavors then I'm okay with that.\n\nI got the spring rolls and banh mi.\nSpring rolls were good. Nothing too special, they were just spring rolls and tasted like spring rolls. The sauce was nuoc mam(fish sauce based) which I liked because I usually make my sauce out of nuoc mam as well. That's my staple. \n\nAs for the banh mi(Vietnamese sandwich), honestly, it doesn't really compare to the ones I've had in San Jose. It was also pretty small but It wasn't as disappointing. I can deal with that. I do wish they can make it a little bigger. I mean it didn't make me full but it was enough where I wouldn't stay hungry.\n\nI'd come back for their simple meals. I don't think I would actually get the noodle soups and/or the more traditional items. It might make me change my mind about this place.", "author": "Ngoc P."}

Thirty [something] year-old fan girl here. I even did a speech in college about her....yah, don't ask. \n\nTwenty minutes in, I sat there utterly confused and thought maybe I was watching the wrong channel. Or, maybe it was the Fernet goggles because I didn't see Britney anywhere so I watched the re-run again last night...sober.\n\nDammit, Lifetime with all the blondes in Hollywood you could of least found a girl that resembles Britney's seventh cousin...that actress looked nothing like her! \n\nAnd, don't get me started on that Britney and Justin post-breakup dance off. It was like walking into the room to find your parents wheelbarrowing - awkwardly bad. \n\nPretty sure all of Britney fans who saw that atrocity felt duped. \n\nThat's how I feel when Yelp leads me astray (duped, that is)....\n\nAn Chi came up as one of the \"hot and new\" businesses on Yelp. Boosting all 5 star reviews, I thought maybe this was the unicorn of all Asian restaurants in Excelsior! If you're familiar with the area, you know the area has great Mexican eateries where you can stuff your face with offal goodness for under $10. But...everything else? Ehhh. \n\nAn Chi's menu is surprisingly small for a Vietnamese restaurant with just 3-4 options each for appetizers, banh mi, pho, bun, and com dia. They have Vietnamese iced coffee but no che or Vietnamese drinks (e.g. coconut juice, sugar cane juice, etc). \n\nThe prices are reasonable with everything under $8.50 but with smaller portions compared to other Vietnamese eateries. Cc's accepted. \n\nGiven how condensed the menu is, I assumed the food would be solid since the chef can perfect a handful of items as opposed to 100 items on the menu. Not to mention all those glowing 5 star reviews....\n\nUnfortunately, the food at An Chi was less than average and comparable to 3 star Vietnamese eateries in Daly City, South San Francisco, and San Bruno. \n\nWe started with the Cha Gio: Imperial Rolls ($5): http://bit.ly/2ldRP4Q which were decent. Hot and crunchy, you can never go wrong with fried anything. The accompanying vermicelli was a clump of overcooked noodles though. \n\nI ordered the Lemongrass Pork Rice Plate ($7): http://bit.ly/2ldRCPo. The pork chop was thin and had a lot of bones. Seasoning was on the sweeter side. The server was honest about their light usage of msg which I greatly appreciated. I was thirsty afterwards but didn't get the usual tongue numbness, headache, and heart palpitations so the msg usage is minimal.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pho Dac Biet: Pho Combo (Large - $8.50) which was meh. The broth is chicken based and the meats were dry and chewy. I had a sip of the broth - it was salty and didn't have that clean chickeny flavor. \n\nThe staff is nice but one of our orders was wrong. My friend had asked for rare beef on the side and it was well done in the bowl. We told the server, \"Sorry, but we asked for rare beef on the side\" to which he replied, \"Well, the cook put the beef in the bowl\" and then walked away. All he had to do was to ask the kitchen to put several slices of raw beef on a plate to rectify the issue. Not a good impression for a grand opening but this has no bearing on my rating since you don't visit Asian restaurants for the stellar service. \n\nParking is very difficult so unless you live in the area, An Chi is not worth trekking across the city for. \n\nSorry, I'll stick with going to the TL or to Ben Tre in Millbrae for solid Vietnamese food.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Just like good street should be.\n\nFor the exemplary Cha Gio, Banh Mi, and outstanding value for money, I have upgraded this review to 5 stars.\n\n\nAddendum 2: Feb 16, 2017\n\nI ordered Bun Cha which featured one of the fabulous Cha Gio rolls, more vegetables and vermicelli and a generous amount of sweet savory caramelized roast pork.

I like supporting independent businesses and love Vietnamese food but this tastes nothing like it. \n\nSF in general has subpar Asian food, Vietnamese even more scarce so I have such high hopes for every time a new place shows up. Sadly it's just your run of the mill Chinese run place (maybe \u8d8a\u5357\u83ef\u50d1) and the food is a poor facsimile of what real VN food tastes like. \n\nBun rieu was almost hard to finish, it's been a while and I just remember watery fish sauce broth which tasted nothing like I know. Cuon was standardly mediocre that I forgot what it even tasted like or if the sauce was house made, I think it was the typical overly sweet nuoc mam, both of which are really easy to make. \n\nMaybe I'll give them another shot eventually but there are other \"Vietnamese\" restaurants nearby that are more passable.", "author": "Peel S."}

I always order the BBQ pork banh mi and deep fried egg rolls and they're usually on point. However, my last order was sub par. The BBQ pork tasted off - almost sour.  The deal breaker was the deep fried egg roll, which my 2 year old usually loves. On this particular order, I broke down the egg roll with the intention to feed it to my son and found a black rock about the size of a quarter. I'm glad I broke it down rather than just handing it to him because it was for sure a choking hazard and at the very least something he could've broken his teeth on.

What a big DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  Imperial rolls were so oily on inside, just tasted a mouthful of oil & nothing else ... oil even squirted in my mouth ... UGG! And to boot, they were burnt all over, like blackened toast after leaving in toaster on high setting - think they don't change oil until it's so bad, rolls just burn on outside & absorb all the crudy old oil on inside ... again UGG. \n\nThen the pork with vermicelli entree, another go to dish, pork was ice cold ... did they give me an order that was not picked up earlier by another customer? Order was done much faster than other times? I was there waiting for it & then back to my house just 5 minutes from place if that. \n\nAfter biting into oily roll & a bite or two of cold pork, I just had to call them to tell them how disgusting this food was, it's been so, so sometimes, really good other times, but never inedible like this order.  All he said was sorry ... well, I am too, even gave them a nice tip as I've done the many times I've been to this place since first opening & getting same order to go 2-3x weeks. Then quality went down so tapered off  ... he definitely knew who I was getting orders as much as I did even if not on a 1st name basis. Well they lost a regular and really loyal customer! ... until now ... figured they would try to make good on this crappy food & at least offer another order to replace the INEDIBLE burnt, oily imperial rolls and cold pork! ... not that I really would want it after this mess, but it would show me they cared about their regular customers. Nope!\n\nNot going back to An Chi ever again and suggest you do same so not disappointed like I was today ... still looking at food on my plate & ready to throw it out ... if I could give it 0 Stars, I would just based on this order & their response, but looks like I'm forced to do the 1 * on Yelp.\n\nFind another place for good quality Vietnamese food you can actually eat and enjoy!\n\nFor future imperial roll cravings ... I get them a lot as I love them so much, I'll go out of my way now, for so much better food you can eat without stomach turning. Will start going back to Lotus Garden @ Mission & 29th. Yeah, pay a few $ more, but all the yrs.

Everything tasted pretty good, especially the deep fried imperial rolls (cha gio)! It's made the traditional way which I really like!! I can only name a few restaurants that makes it that way. The Vietnamese coffee hit the spot! My friend liked pho as well, I will try that next time. I ended up getting full before I got the chance to try my sandwich. Definitely a nice addition to the area but parking is a bit tough.", "author": "Cheryl L."}

We got the #1, 3, and 6 (combo beef, chicken, bun bo hue) along with some Viet coffee. Service was extremely prompt, and food came out great -- tons of flavor with rich broth. Way better than Pho Nice down the block. Normally after pho from Kevin's, Turtle Tower, or Pho 2000 I'd have to drink tons of water because of how much salt they pack into their broths, but I didn't need to after this meal which at the very least, tells me that they don't confuse salt with flavor. I'd definitely make this my go to for pho in the neighborhood because of their taste to price, service, and general cleanliness.", "author": "Zhi L."}

The pho have a lot of beef balls and beef tripes! My hubby is not a big fan of Vietnamese sandwich but he said the sandwich here is really good. We also order a grill pork spring roll.

It was a little too sweet than most other places which I didn't like. If they decreased the amount of sugar in their broth, then it would be so much better! I also got an order of the imperial rolls which were good as well. I wouldn't order them again though because $5 for only 2 egg rolls is pretty pricey. I'd rather have another egg roll than the side of noodles they plate with it.\n\nOverall, it was good and I would come back again for sure but only for the pho. I'll try the chicken pho next time!", "author": "Patricia S."}

We happened to come here after my nail appointment a few blocks away and came across this place via Yelp. It wasn't crowded at all and we got a table immediately. They have all your Vietnamese food staples like imperial rolls, pho, rice plates, vermicelli bowls and even Viet sandwiches! We both went for a bowl of noodles; me the beef pho and my sister got bun rieu. both at 8.50 each, both large which is a  really good price! They only offer the large option for bun rieu and for the beef pho they have a regular size also which is an additional +$1. The large bowls here really are big! I had so much leftover noodles but the meat and broth were soooo yummy with tender meat and broth is not too salty. This was perfect for the usual SF foggy weather. Not to also mention this restaurant is really clean! I would totally come back here again when I'm in the area since I don't visit this part of the Mission much.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Based on the previous reviews I figured that I'd at least give them a shot.  Ordered the pho tai and I thought it was nothing special but fair.  The soup could have used more noodles, it was quite stingy for a large size.  The broth was just ok, it was sufficient enough to eat I guess.  At this point I'm willing to try again in the future.  Yesterday I was craving pho and since I saw this place opens @ 9am, I remembered I told myself I'd give them another try.  I'm sad to say I was less enthusiastic than the 1st time.  I ordered the pho/bahn mi combo priced at 12$.  Yes the price is nice on the wallet, but the soup was absolutely terrible this time.  As the waiter brought it too the table I noticed a pungent fish sauce smell.  I know that fish sauce is used to flavor the broth but this was going overboard.  I've never been able to smell fish sauce emulating from my phos elsewhere.  I tasted it, whoaaaaa, it was nothing remotely close to a pho beef broth.  It was str8 fish sauce salty city.  I barely got through a quarter of it.  There was no hint of star anise, cinnamon, and others.  It was totally masked but the irresponsible use of fish sauce.  The bahn MI I got was beef, and it was sub par at best.  This place will not get a third chance by this customer.  This is sad because I really wanted to have a go to pho place in the excelsior/outer mission area, which there is none.", "author": "Pedro N."}
