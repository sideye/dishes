I wanted to venture away from something other than my typical Asian fare and coming from the midwest, I never had the chance to try Cambodian food and let me tell you, I was shook when I tried their food. \n\nWe ordered the Cambodian pineapple fried rice, the pumpkin curry with chicken, and the ahmok. \n\nHonestly the star of this dinner was easily the pumpkin curry. The curry was thick and beautiful with a lovely vegetable medley. BUT THE FACT THAT THIS CURRY WAS SERVED IN A HALF PUMPKIN WAS AMAZING. That's all I wanted to eat after the first bite: the pumpkin and some rice. As a heads up, don't think that ordering fried rice can compensate for rice with curry cause you're gonna be masking the flavor of the fried rice. And unfortunately that's what I did. The pineapple fried rice ended up being a vehicle for the delicious curry and I had so many regrets. But from what I remember of eating the fried rice, it was equally delicious for those not too adventurous on this menu. TL;DR hurry to get that pumpkin curry.\n\nThe ahmok was also very tasty! Described as a baked fish mousse, it might not seem too appetizing at first but the flavor is grand. The texture is not my favorite, but that would not deter me from eating it again. Make sure you put some of the sauce on each spoonful too! \n\nOverall, I would come back to this place in a heartbeat. Three dishes that made us disgustingly but blissfully full came out to be like, $23 each. If you get the curry, just ask for a side of rice. \n\nThe ambience and service was also amazing, our hostess was so precious and kind and the napkin presentation was on point.", "author": "Michael L."}

Needless to say Angkor Borei definitely satisfied that need!\n\nFor me, seeing as it was my first time having Cambodian food, I naturally asked my friend to recommend some staples he'd always get, so he ordered ahead for me. I was pretty pleased with the food overall.\n\nCambodian Crepe ($10)- Really crisp, and the filling inside was rich and had plenty of flavor. Pretty decent!\n\nBeef LARB ($10)- Really solid! The beef larb was really packed with flavor from the rest of the spices and I really enjoyed this. I'd pick this up again if I was back.\n\nAhmok- A classic Cambodian dish, my friend really enjoyed it and said it tasted very reminiscent of the ahmok he'd get back home. A definite recommend from him!\n\nFried Bananna & Coconut Ice Cream  ($6) - Pairs off with a scoop of Mitchells Ice Cream. While the fried Bananna was good, it also got soggy way too quickly. Paired with the ice cream it was good. Probably wouldn't get this again here though.\n\nService here was really sweet. The waitress/assumedly one of the co-owners of Ankor Borei was really accommodating and made us feel right at home, so it was a comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n\nI'd give Angkor Borei a 4.5.

It's just far enough away from me on the 14-Mission for me to heave an audible sigh before rejecting a trip over here. Well, I finally decided to brace myself for the grittiest MUNI ride in the city next to the 19-Polk. Actually the ride wasn't that bad, and I was looking forward to having some Cambodian cuisine, especially from a family-run place that has been serving it for over thirty years. I was their first customer that day, and they were hawking their $8.95 lunch combination plates. The choices seemed a bit on the generic side to me, but...\n\nHow can I argue with that bargain price when you get their house special soup and a scoop of jasmine rice with two entree selections? The soup was a watery broth partially spiced with chunks of tofu and cucumber (photo: http://bit.ly/2HPotG5). It lingered in my tongue longer than in my memory. For my entrees, I chose the BBQ Chicken which consisted of two small pieces nicely charred along with a sweet dipping sauce and a tiny salad. The poultry was tender enough to enjoy. Not as much with the Napa Cabbage with Shrimp, which although saut\u00e9ed was on the wet side (photo: http://bit.ly/2qZfj0d). Yep, I should come back for their Cambodian specials in the evening.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...totally hamstrung by the restricted choices for the lunch combos..my bad\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit on the dark side but a nice space nonetheless\nSERVICE - 4 stars...I think that was co-owner Chinhan Yat who served me, very friendly\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Cambodian restaurants can serve generic lunches, too", "author": "Ed U."}

As we walked in we were immediately greeted by the owner. She was very friendly and welcoming. Since we've never been there we asked her to recommend us a couple of dishes. She right away suggested Amok and Pumpkin Curry. We also ordered the beef laap to balance out the sweetness of the other dishes. \n\nThe Amok was delicious! It had a smooth coconut and curry flavors. The fish just melts in your mouth. It was creamy and rich. The pumpkin curry was also a hit! We chose chicken as the protein. The fresh vegetables were cooked just right where it still had a bit of a crunch to it. It's sweet and savory. The beef laap balanced out everything very well. It had just the right amount of saltiness and tartness with a bit of a kick to it just as we preferred.

Ohhh that beautiful savory crepe. And then I thought, there's gotta be a place in SF, my new home, where I can again venture into this heavenly cuisine. And there is! It's called Angkor Borei and you have to go! \n\nThis place is FANTASTIC! It's a little off the beaten path towards Bernal Heights and outside of the mission, but you seriously cannot go wrong. If I had a Cambodian grandmother and she served me warm food in her humble abode, it would feel like my experience at Angkor Borei - cozy and delightful. \n\nI skimmed the menu for a bit, my eyes just eagerly searching for that crepe, and there it was! So naturally, we had to order it as an appetizer. For our main, we ordered the Ahmohk fish, a recommendation from our amicable and down to earth server :). \n\nWhen the crepe arrived, my first thought was wow this is big for an appetizer! The crepe is pretty thin, but quite crispy and filled with generous amounts of ground pork, shrimp, shredded coconuts and sprouts. I dipped a piece into the garlic-lemon sauce and placed it on my mouth. My eyes immediately closed in happiness - holy moly an explosion of flavors and textures! This is one heck of a good appetizer and an authentically Cambodian dish that definitely reminded me of what I would get in Ithaca.\n\nNext, the Ahmohk came....UN.REAL. The fish was so perfectly cooked, almost buttery, with this amazing curry leaf flavor. We had asked for it spicy and they delivered,but it was so good! It too came with a similar citrusy sauce as the crepe, which really went brilliantly with the fish. \n\nWe were super satisfied with the meal. Angkor delivered great and fair priced Cambodian food in a humble and unassuming space, with lovely service. I would definitely recommend the crepe and Ahmohk! If you're not feeling that, then ask the server what else is good here (she did mention the pumpkin curry!). But, I would definitely stick to the more Cambodian dishes because why would you come to such a great establishment and order pad Thai eh? :)", "author": "Sabina S."}

It's nice to to have Asian food, but not the typical Chinese, Japanese, Thai or Vietnamese that SF seems to thrive on. It was refreshing to have Cambodian food, not your typical Asian cuisine. Coming to the outer Mission was quite a trek, and the parking was terrible (had to circle at least 3x), but this food was really great quality and worth the trip!\n\nHighlight dishes:\n-Pumpkin curry. Man oh man! They give you a lot of pumpkin, and I just really loved the curry sauce. It's definitely NOT the same as what you'd get at a Thai restaurant or Chinese place. This curry was on the slightly thicker side, but not OVERLY thick. Just the right amount. Remember to get rice.\n\n-Crispy Tofu appetizer - wow! It was crispy, and also had this really good slightly sour sauce, with basil. So delicious. Never had anything like it. \n\n-Curry fried rice - it was your typical Southeast Asian type of fried rice, that came with pineapple. It was decent, but I felt like I could get this at other restaurants. \n\nI didn't realize that Cambodian food doesn't have a focus on noodles. There was only one noodle dish (pad thai), that I think was just there to satisfy picky eaters lol. Also, there were a lot of dishes that I can't wait to try for next time, like the soups, prawns, and meat dishes. \n\nThe lady working here said she's been in the business for 30 years.

But, because of that, I ended up asking what looked to be the owner for some recommendations, to which she suggested their prahok: a stewed ground pork with a pinch of anchovy, served up with a bunch of raw veggies.\n\nNow, admittedly, when I read the description of \"served with vegetable dip,\" I assumed the dip was an aside. But nah, rather, the stewed pork itself was the dip, as it came on this large platter surrounded by the aforementioned vegetables. Not at all what I was expecting, but definitely an interesting, and somewhat enjoyable experience. I say somewhat because I still find it weird to eat any sort of Asian cuisine that has meat without any carbs, and in this case, the protein was on the saltier side and would have benefited from it. Likewise, my friend's pla dook pad ped (fried catfish) was not bad, but also on the saltier end of things.\n\n3 stars, all done and said.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The restaurant looks a bit cramped upon entering, but despite appearances, is actually pretty spacious once you're inside.\n\nBathroom - Didn't use them.", "author": "Johnny W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-30", "description": "TLDR - Good, flavorful Cambodian food! Try the charbroiled pork slices and the ahmohk!\n\nEver since visiting Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago, I've had cravings on and off for Thai and Cambodian food. You don't see a lot of restaurants labelled as Cambodian in SF (or in the states in general, I'm guessing), so I was pretty excited when I found Angkor Borei. I'm ashamed to say I don't really know the difference between Thai and Cambodian food (they seemed pretty similar where I went in the two countries), but Angkor Borei did a solid job satisfying my cravings.\n\nThe restaurant is your typical Asian restaurant - no frills, probably family-owned/run - and easily overlooked from the outside unless you're specifically looking for it. My group of 5 came around 6pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was surprisingly quiet and empty. A lady, who I assume to be the owner, told us that most of her customers dine a lot later, and true to her word, the restaurant got a lot busier around 7:30-8pm. Also to my surprise, parking was very difficult to find, despite it being in the outskirts of SF.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive here, like at most Asian restaurants, but I had some pretty specific cravings: papaya salad, tom yum soup, fish amok and pumpkin curry. We also ordered the charbroiled pork per Yelp's suggestion, the claypot shrimp for some more seafood, asparagus for some veggies and mango sticky rice for dessert. \n\nMost of the dishes were pretty good and flavorful, but I'd definitely have to recommend the AHMOHK and CHARBROILED PORK SLICES. Both had great texture and flavor. I also loved that the food in general here wasn't greasy! Most Thai restaurants in the States use a ridiculous amount of oil in their cooking, which was not actually the case in Thailand. Portions are a little on the smaller side given the price and in comparison to similar restaurants, but still very reasonable.\n\nThe thai iced tea ($4.45) is pretty sweet here, but I loved the coconut ($4.45) - refreshing and they give you a spoon to scoop out all the coconut meat!\n\n#5 NHOAM LAHONG / PAPAYA SALAD ($7.95) - 4/5\nPretty solid. Ingredients are fresh but it's lacking some of the complexity in flavor that papaya salads are supposed to have. It's a little salty and a tad sweet, but it's missing the spiciness and acidity. Still liked it though!\n\n#13 SPICY HOT & SOUR SOUP ($11.95) - 4/5\nBasically like Thai tom yum soup. Light but flavorful soup. Sour and a little bit spicy, but definitely could've used more spiciness.\n\n#30 CHARBROILED PORK SLICES ($9.75) - 5/5\nMMM. If you love meat, I definitely recommend this! The pork was super tender (with very little fat) and absolutely delicious. Not greasy either! Tasted amazing on its own or with the sweet and sour/acidic sauce it was served with. \n\n#48 AHMOHK ($12.95) - 5/5\nOn 7x7's list of things to eat in SF. I had fish amok for the first time in Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago and I've been craving it ever since. It's not something I normally see at Thai restaurants in the states (or maybe I just never looked for it on the menu before), so I was really excited to see it on the menu here. It's not quite as good as authentic amok, but it definitely didn't disappoint! The amok was rich and flavorful with a perfectly light, creamy mousse texture. The fish was soft and moist, and there was shrimp and scallops in the amok too. Only weird thing was the random piece of broccoli at the bottom. Paired with a salty fish sauce, but I wouldn't add that to the amok. \n\n#53 CLAYPOT SHRIMP ($12.95) - 3/5\nNothing bad about it but nothing particularly interesting at all. Just some steamed shrimp and steamed veggies, served with some sort of sour sauce, but otherwise rather plain and flavorless without the sauce. Great healthy option though. \n\n#65 ASPARAGUS SAUTEED WITH SPICES & COCONUT MILK ($9.95) - 3/5\nServed with your choice of meat (chicken, beef, pork or squid) but my group chose to leave out the meat. Pretty much tasted like the pumpkin curry. Nothing special and not sure if asparagus is really authentic to Cambodia (I definitely didn't see anything asparagus while I was there)\n\nPUMPKIN CURRY ($14.95) - 3.5/5\nSolid but didn't stand out that much. The curry was light rather than creamy/heavy and pretty flavorful, and the pumpkin had a nice soft texture. We got ours with chicken, which was just okay. \n\nMANGO STICKY RICE ($4.95) - 3.5/5\nNot bad but not authentic.. Rather than actual sticky rice, they used purple rice, which isn't sticky and has a firmer texture than sticky rice. The mango was fresh and very ripe and sweet though, and the cream was sweet and salty.", "author": "Jessie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "Situated in the outskirts of the Mission, Angkor Borei isn't the hot spot you'd wander into with happy-hour drunchies; it's tucked away in a peaceful little niche. Inside, the traditional decor is serene, unlike some flashy Thai restaurants with gold-embellished everything. \n\nYelp recommends the spinach leaves appetizer, amok, and pumpkin curry. I've had Cambodian food before with a Cambodian friend, so I guess can claim that I have some knowledge of this unique cuisine. In my opinion, the spinach leaves appetizer is a victim of the Yelp syndrome--it seems more for show because all the little clear containers for the sauces and toppings look really neat, but I can't imagine an exceptional appetizer emerging from raw spinach leaves and a small platter of miscellany. The amok and pumpkin curry tho.....!!\n\n(++) We started off with the CHARBOILED CHICKEN SKEWERS, a traditional Cambodian festive food. It was a bit charred but juicy and tender, made even better with the interesting sauce (interesting in a good sense).\n\n(+++) The PUMPKIN CURRY sounds plain, but there is something about Angkor Borei's rendition that's addicting. I believe they use kabocha squash, and it's cooked to soft perfection soaked up with the rich curry. Orange on orange, with complimentary flavors and textures. (Pretty presentation too: an artistic contrast of roundly cut pumpkin in a square plate. Among the more artsy curries you'll ever see.) \n\n(++) I loved the AMOK with its characteristic fluffy texture, but this one seemed to have more spices and was only partially wrapped in the leaf when it's usually cooked entirely wrapped. This left a delicious slightly crispy exterior... the muffin tops of amok. Be warned though, my friends weren't too fond of this so fish mousse (understandably strange-sounding) may not be for everyone. Not complaining, more to myself! \n\nIt's a little pricey at a little under $20 per person (albeit for lots of food), though reasonable for the specialties, especially since I believe this is the only Cambodian place in SF. After all, how many people can pull off fish mousse wrapped in banana leaf?", "author": "Edna C."}

The lemon garlic sauce it was served with was very tasty. \n\n-- Duck Prik King: This dish was perfect. The duck was tasty, the green beans were cooked perfectly, and my favorite part was the addition of fresh basil.

We agreed on all of them and ordered the following: pumpkin curry, crispy Cambodian crepe, sauteed beef and ahmonk along with 4 Thai iced teas.\n\nCambodian crepe (7.95)- similar in appearance to Vietnamese cuisines's Banh Xeo. I actually liked this one more than Vietnamese style because there was a hint of coconut flavor with fine minced pork. The skin is super crispy and contrasts well with the soft filling!\n\nPumpkin curry (14.95) - Once again flavor wasn't super strong but definitely still had the curry flavor similar to creamy coconut flavors of Thai Curry. Mild but tasty over rice. \n\nSauteed beef (9.95) - I think this would be my least favorite dish out of the four. I think I'm just not a fan of lemon grass though. \n\nAhmohk (10.95) - I never had a fish curry mousse before! This came out looking like a cupcake. I loved the soft texture! The flavor wasn't too strong either, as said in the description its very mild.\n\nIf you are a fan of Thai cuisine I would recommend trying Cambodian too! There are a lot of similar flavors. Honestly I have never been to Cambodia so I wouldn't be able to comment on authenticity but it all tasted good at least :). I would definitely recommend trying Ahmohk if you want something different! The Cambodian crepe is also a good one to try. The curry was good but I would say it's not too different from Thai curry so not a must try.

My friends and I (group of 6) came on a Sunday night and were seated right away. We started with two appetizers, the spinach leaves and grilled beef skewers (like satay). The spinach leaves dish consisted of raw spinach leaves and a bunch of little fillings like chopped onion, chopped ginger, dried shrimps, chopped bell pepper, chopped lime, peanuts, and a sweet/savory sauce. The idea was to wrap a tiny bit of every topping in the spinach leaf and eat it like a taco--despite being a super simple dish, the flavor mixture from all the different fillings was so complex! The grilled beef satay was also unbelievable. The beef was flavorful, not dry, and came with a perfectly savory, delicious peanut sauce. For the main course, we split a couple items like a shrimp stir-fry, a chicken stir-fry, a beef stir-fry, and the pumpkin curry. The stir-fries were simple (and similar) but tasty--my favorite was the beef, which was tender and garlicy. But the pumpkin curry was by far the favorite dish of the table--the curry was lightly spicy and full of fresh vegetables, including a half kabocha pumpkin. The sauce went perfectly with the brown rice we ordered on the side and we could easily have drunk it up! We also ordered the Amok, a curry fish custard in banana leaf, which was so unique in texture and taste--it was piping hot and spiced perfectly. Unfortunately, they forgot to start this dish after we put in our order (and it also takes the longest to prepare) so we didn't get it until we were basically done with the other dishes, but it was worth the wait.

Lots of fish packed in this mid-sized bamboo thing, definitely will get you full. Flavorful and moist! Kinda like curry fish but subtle, and not saucy? It was good though, and worth trying but not mind-blowing.\n\nSpinach leaves - basically an appetizer where you wrap toasted coconut, dried shrimp, bell pepper, onion, ginger, peanuts and top it with some kinda fish sauce. It didn't look like that much but it was a good serving size for an app at least, maybe because you had to do so much work to spoon each thing and then wrap it. Otherwise I would feel jipped!\n\nPumpkin curry - I've had better, honestly, but it wasn't bad!\n\nService was friendly and fast!\n\nI don't think I would return again since nothing blew my mind, and it's in Bernal Heights (I don't come here often!) but def worth trying!", "author": "Emily C."}

Even when i listen to the cooks talk in the back, my relatives and I couldn't /didn't hear anything resembling the khmer language....you will be hard pressed to see anything different between this location and King of Thai...furthermore, the papaya salad listed above is dry and more on the bland side..\n\nHow exactly is this placed considered by any means \"Cambodian\" cuisine? This place is more like a westernized location for people who's taste buds can't tell the difference between Asian cuisines; particularly Thai -Cambodian-Laotion..the type of eaters who think all noodle soups are the same.(-1)\n\nRecommendation:Champa garden has a more consistent and flavor salad.\n\nB ) Duck Pri King is recooked \"Siu Yap\" Chinese roasted duck in spices and curry. Not freshly made.It really burns your lips and throat and you can't eat anything else on the menu... do avoid for safety purposes...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-30", "description": "The closest thing I've come to the Cambodian culture is going into AOL's KhMeR PriDe chat room years ago. I'm not Khmer, I was just a nosey f*ck.\n\nOh yah and the girl crush I had in hs only to find out she later became a nun?!?! Ugh, what a waste.\n\nOddly enough, the only Cambodian restaurant in San Francisco is located in the outskirts of The Mission and not in TL's Little Saigon. \n\nCambodian food is very similar to Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Angkor has a well-rounded menu including a vegetarian menu with mock meats. Absolutely no MSG is used as I confirmed it with the owner who said she avoids using this as it gives her headaches. She said, I would be able to \"feel it\" IF they use MSG (some Asian restaurants claim to use no MSG but they do) and she was right. I didn't get the heart palpitations, dry mouth, and headaches as I usually do with Asian food. Whoo hoo, bonus points!\n\nYou can normally tell if an ethnic restaurant is legit if there's natives dining there; I saw none and we were one of the only two Asian parties. And looking through reviews written by Khmer natives, it seems Angkor serves more Americanized Cambodian food which was obvious as some dishes really lacked the big, bold flavors present in Southeast Asian cuisine. However, they do use a lot of anchovies as a base for many of their dishes so you may a detect a pungent saltiness in some dishes and sauces.\n\nF O O D\nWe ordered a total of 12 dishes for our group of 6; doubling up on some: http://bit.ly/VnUv9O. It's worthless to go through every single dish we ordered so I'll focus on my faves. \n\nSorry for some of the blurry pics. I couldn't reach across the table so I asked Mr. NSS to help me take pics of dishes closer to him. Needless to say, he can't aim. =X\n\n*Fresh Spinach Leaves ($6.95): http://bit.ly/XSpXxe\n*Crispy Cambodian Crepe ($7.95): http://bit.ly/VnUCCg\n*Charbroiled Beef Skewers ($7.95): http://bit.ly/UDh11g\n*Cold Cambodian Noodles ($6.95): http://bit.ly/VvVKcn\n*Ahmok: Fish Curry Mousse ($9.95 x 2): http://bit.ly/VnUTVP\n*Duck Prik King: Duck in Red Curry ($10.95 x 2): http://bit.ly/129NDUF\n*Pumpkin Curry w/ Shrimp ($14.95): http://bit.ly/Wy9cdI\n*Prahok: Stewed Ground Pork ($9.95 x 2): http://bit.ly/UDhqR7\n*Beef Pad Thai ($8.95): http://bit.ly/11fIxRS\n\nIf the 2013 7x7 Big Eats List brought you here and steered you wrong again, you can show them the one finger salute again. While the 7x7's Ahmok: Fish Curry Mousse had deliciously tender flakes of fish, the texture was more like a quiche than a mousse. I was not impressed.\n\nRedeeming this, was the Prahok: Stewed Pork in Coconut Milk w/ Anchovies. Forget the raw veggies you're supposed to use for dipping and slather this thick, creamy pork concoction over your rice (they have brown rice). The anchovies gave this dish a surprisingly mouth-watering, salty punch that was purely addicting.\n\nThe Pumpkin Curry w/ Shrimp was a second fav. I didn't care for the shrimp because it was all about the rich, savory coconuty sauce and the sweet, tender kabocha it was served in. It definitely needed more of a kick though as the curry was too mild.\n\nThe guys loved and killed two orders of the Duck Prik King which was basically Chinese roast duck in a savory, slightly spicy red curry sauce and green beans. You can never go wrong with rich, fatty duck right?\n\nOh and if you must order an appetizer, get the Fresh Spinach Leaves. Nothing says, \"sexy\" like eating with your hands. Build your own Cambodian spinach \"taco\" with dried shrimp, peanuts, ginger, lime, red onion, bell peppers and toasted coconut and dip it into the sweet and sour sauce for a tasty textural sensation in the mouth.\n\nS E R V I C E\nWearing traditional Cambodian Sampots (long cloth worn as a skirt), the owner and staff were very welcoming and friendly as well as socially engaging. However, food service was slow as there was a 35 minute lag from apps to entrees.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nNormally, I would never suggest an Asian joint for a date, but Angkor (50 person capacity) is tastefully decorated with glass encased gold embroidered linen place mats, sultry burgundy walls and straws topped with a paper rose which make it quite a romantic yet casual place.\n\nP A R K I N G\nHorrendous street parking at night so allot an additional 15 minutes for parking.\n\nSpeaking of AOL chat rooms, am I the only that wishes they still existed?

The catfish wrapped in banana leaves was pretty good! Angkor Borei uses fish sauce as a dipping sauce for the dish which we thought was unnecessary. It just made it taste more fishy....\n\nMango & Sitcky Rice - This is a very common dessert in many Southeast Asian restaurants.

My love of food runs deep, so that was enough to pique my interest and get me over here for lunch. \n\nThe joint was a ghost town at one o'clock on a weekday. We took a table up front by the window. Our waitress brought over two small glasses of water. \n\nI haven't had much Cambodian food before, but the menu looked very similar to what you'd expect to find at a Thai restaurant. Some ingredients were different (obviously),  but overall if you like Thai you'd like this. The lunch special allows you to pick two entrees, which come with soup, rice, and a small salad. I got the ginger beef and sauteed chicken. The dishes both had a nice refreshing quality to them, thanks to some cilantro in the beef and spearmint in the chicken. Amazing what a little touch of something different can do for an otherwise simple lunch. My beef was a bit tough, the chicken a tad dry, but the overall flavoring and quality were totally good. \n\nIt may not have lived up to the hype our house menu had led us to believe, but this is a perfectly good place to grab a great lunch special.", "author": "Anthony A."}

They said they normally use it, and they could leave it out - good enough for me!  \n\nI ordered the Pumpkin Curry with Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/angkor-borei-restaurant-san-francisco?select=-G-tBshK7PjJdvMrjo23dw#PV3f-ESeXHJwZj0CNYngoQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/angkor-borei-restaurant-san-francisco?select=-G-tBshK7PjJdvMrjo23dw#BllTpPmkD3wHjYAOO4yLXQ and Steamed Vegetables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/angkor-borei-restaurant-san-francisco?select=-G-tBshK7PjJdvMrjo23dw#3Nb5IA_Zld2qet3rcYU-lw\n\nThe pumpkin curry had a lot going on, and in all the right ways. It had a lot of vegetables, the right amount of heat, and a tasty sauce. I was really happy with the dish. \n\nThe steamed vegetables were nothing special, but I took home the leftovers and had them packaged with the curry, so they soaked up the delicious pumpkin curry sauce. After that, they became special too. \n\nService was friendly and ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning and trying other dishes.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

It was pretty good, loved the fish sauce with it plus the brown rice! mmmm. My friend ordered the pra houk which was pretty good (but I'm used to my mom's version so I prefer it a lot better). My sister's bf ordered the fried tofu which was quite yummy -- I especially loved the flash fried basil! mmmm.\n\nI ordered the duck red curry which was soo delicious -- probably my favorite dish we tried that night.\n\nWould come again and would definitely recommend!

Can't really comment on the authenticity as I only have very limited exposure to Cambodian cuisine. My review is purely based on the feedback from my taste buds.\n\nCrispy Cambodian Crepe (4/5 Stars) - Very crispy just like the name suggested. \n\nStewed Ground Pork (Prahok) (4/5 Stars) - Never had this before. From the name I was guessing this is a heavy meat dish. Instead, I was greeted with a healthy salad like plate. This is a platter of raw vegetable that you eat with a light lime sauce with ground pork. I love it.\n\nPumpkin Curry (4/5 Stars) - Smooth, buttery and very delicious. But then I am really a sucker for anything pumpkin and it is not hard to impress me.\n\nAhmok (3/5 Stars) - Too salty to eat with the fish sauce and too plain without the sauce. The fish was cooked to a perfect succulent texture. It would have been great if it was more flavorful.\n\nClay Pot Shrimp (3/5 Stars) - Not as memorable as the other dishes. The portion is rather small and there aren't many noodles in there. The broth/sauce was light and refreshing.\n\nThe portion was on the smaller side. Our group of four ordered four entrees and one appetizer to share and we aren't terribly full.", "author": "Mona W."}

The beef and peanut curry was good, but after a while it was too rich of a dish and made me feel a little sick.

We got takeout a few days later and the quality was the same.\n\n* The sauce with the Chili Chicken was delicious and by far one of the favorites amongst my friends. A few days later we got the Chili Pork for takeout. This was not as good. Please note I asked for very (VERY) spicy and it still came out only lightly seasoned so if you are a heat lover, this is not the place for you.\n\n* The BBQ chicken is really quite delicious and I only got it for takeout. The chicken is flavorful and there was a lot of chicken to be had. I could have split the dish actually.\n\n* A friend had a special pumpkin curry that he said was delicious.\n\nSo far, I can only recommend chicken or veggie dishes but I have seen the beef and it looks good.

The fish itself was reasonably done, but the rest of the dish just felt like somebody threw a bunch of unrelated ingredients on a plate. Not particularly interesting. Where were the salty hints of fish sauce, the spicy bits of chile, or even the sour tamarind that usually come with Cambodian food? \n\nAs someone who has lived in Cambodia previously and traveled throughout Southeast Asia, it was disappointing to come to the only Cambodian place in the city and find just mostly bland generic Asian food.", "author": "Amy D."}

It was generally similar to other Southeast Asian dishes (rice, noodles, stirfried veggies and tofu), but several of the dishes we ordered had distinct flavors. \n\nI found the spinach leaves appetizer to be particularly interesting. I don't think I'd order it again because it's something I could easily make at home but I am happy to have tried it, particularly because the raw, fresh dish balanced out all the other heavier cooked food we went with. The spinach leaves dish comes with a bowl of raw spinach leaves, then a series of smaller bowls of raw chopped onions, ginger, mango, peanuts, limes, jalapenos, and fried onions. It also comes with a bowl of shrimp so just ask to omit that.\n\nFor our entrees, we went with the tofu clay pot, mango soy chicken, and the mixed vegetable soup. I didn't care for the soft tofu in the clay pot (I'm not a fan of soft tofu), but I thought the broth and veggies were delicious. The mango soy chicken also had a good flavor but it didn't strike me as being any different from vegan mango chicken dishes I've had in Chinese, Thai, and generic vegetarian \"Asian fusion\" restaurants. The vegetable soup was probably my favorite just because I really love soup and the veggies were really fresh.\n\nFor dessert, we went with the mango sticky rice, which is a very common vegan dessert in  many Asian restaurants. What I really liked about this one was that it was made with black rice, which made it a little different and gave it a deeper flavor.\n\nThe service was very prompt, friendly, and accommodating, and the ambiance was warm and relaxed. I must mention that there was a really odd smell by our table, which was right next to the door. It smelled like cat and was really off-putting but I'm wondering if it was coming from outside, as I didn't smell it in the middle or back of the restaurant when I went to use the restaurant.

Parking here can be a nightmare though, so if you can avoid it, I would definitely recommend taking the bus.\n\nAnyway, got the fresh spinach leaf. Which was pretty good and a new experience... never thought I could use a spinach leaf to wrap stuff up with. There was a bunch of other ingredients like roasted coconut, dried shrimp, peanuts, bell peppers, and other things. It was fun in the beginning... but when you're hungry... YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO EACH INGREDIENT AT A TIME!!! At one point I wish they just threw everything in a bowl and just called it a spinach salad. But I guess some people may not like certain things... so doing it individually would be more helpful. We shared the pumpkin curry and the fish mousse. Both were delicious and flavorful. I wasn't sure where the mousse was.... but there was definitely a lot of fish chunks in the bowl. Which was fine for me since the fish was tender, moist, and flavorful. There was a lot of curry too and it was very flavorful too. I think they used to serve the curry in the pumpkin... but now they cut up the pumpkin and mix it in with the curry and serve it out the bowl. Which is fine with me as long as it tastes good! Remember to order a bowl of rice or something since everything is richly flavored, you want something to balance out all the flavors. Waitress was nice and kept our drinks refilled. Place seemed clean, a little dim inside but oh well. Definitely worth giving this place a try if you're looking for reasonably priced and good food!", "author": "Johnson S."}

They stopped delivering half a year ago; not sure why Yelp! still says they do. \n\nI got the charbroiled beef skewers and chili chicken. At first, I didn't get it. The beef had flavor in some places, but it seemed average. I'm not a huge sauce/condiment person, but I decided to try the sauce that came with the beef. I GET IT NOW. It was yummy!\n\nAs for the chili chicken, I ordered a medium and expected to be able to handle it. And then I couldn't, especially since my lips were sunburnt. I asked for the check even though I had a lot left since it was too spicy for me. The waiter and waitress (couple?) were honestly the sweetest and most genuine servers I've ever had! (They're a little slow, but they take care of the whole place themselves.) On top of being attentive and conversational, they really take care of you. She insisted they make me a new plate of chili chicken and even said that she gets mad at the cooks when they occasionally make the plates too spicy, thinking everyone can tolerate it as well as them. The chili chicken was pretty good--good mix of chicken and vegetables--but the jalape\u00f1o and chili flavor was a little too strong for me. My own fault though; I'll come back for something less spicy next time!\n\n I'm glad they don't deliver anymore; or else I wouldn't have been able to experience the best service I will probably ever have.", "author": "Kimberly Y."}

I was wary that it might be one of those dishes that are over-hyped purely for its novelty.  False!  It deserves every accolade.  Complex and savory curry sauce in a comforting, soft pumpkin shell.  Not too heavy, not too much heat.\n\nAhmohk: based on previous reviews I was expecting something very strange.  But it's really just an oversized fishball, with the main difference being the presence of chunks of whole fish.  My dining partners thought it was okay, but I thought it was great.  For delivery, the presentation (scooped upon some large green leaves) was nice.\n\nLarb: I'll be honest. I ordered this because it's a fun word to say.  Didn't even look at the ingredients.

It easily took 35 minutes to get to that side of town. As this is the only Cambodian restaurant in San Francisco, I was really excited to try it out.

This restaurant in particular follows closely to the style of thai food and portion is fair if eaten family style.  This review is going to suck a bit because I don't remember the names of all the dishes I tried but I remember the amok and pineapple fried rice tasting mighty good.\n\nThe venue is on Mission in a nice cozey spot near a small taekwondo studio. Parking is a little difficult as of most places in the city.  For the most part their service is great... up until the end of our dining experience.\n\nSo I would've given this restaurant a 4 star probably any other night but based off my one and first experience I had to bring down a star based off their response to a broken credit card machine. I'm glad they accept credit cards but when a group of people are trying to catch a movie and it takes 20+ minutes to pay for the bill and instead of notifying us right away so we can pay cash - they just stayed away from our table and ignored us completely - which was far from cool. Telling us 15 minutes into it and me, having to go up to you to let you know we have cash to pay isn't my idea of a good dining experience or service.  That killed the night and we missed out on our movie. Hope credit card machine is fixed and thanks for the lack of compensation and communication.

I can't say I've grown up with any Cambodian friends or family cooking for me nor have I been to Cambodia, but as my only outlet for Cambodian food this place is great!  I try to avoid the more generic looking Asian dishes to truly lap up the Cambodian experience.  It's tasty and it's the only Cambodian restaurant option in San Francisco so it is a win in my book!\n\nBlanket Prawns: We've all had those shrimp appetizers at Asian restaurants with shrimp wrapped in deep fried spring roll dough.  Shrimp is good and fried is good, what more could you want?  BACON!  Don't know why no one has done this before, but everything is better with bacon.\n\nFried Pork Rib: Yuck!  Remind me to stick with slow cooked ribs because these were tough and gristly, more so than those glowing orange ribs you see in Chinatown.  Allegedly there was some sort of marinade, but you could have fooled me.\n\nStewed Ground Pork (Prahok): My favorite dish here!  This feels authentically Cambodian since it doesn't look like anything you're gonna find elsewhere.  A bunch of raw veggies (eggplant, cucumber, cabbage, carrot, celery, etc.) that you dip into a savory bowl of ground pork and coconut milk.  It almost feels healthy and way more exciting than any veggie dip I've seen before.  One drawback is that the vegetables could be a little fresher or at least more freshly prepared, the carrot rounds had that old white fuzz on them.\n\nPumpkin Curry: Seasonal, yes.  Original, not so much.  I've had this dish at Thai restaurants before and loved it then.  The pumpkin is such a creamy vegetable that it really adds a nice complexity to the curry beyond the coconut.  Tofu was our protein which was a little bland, guess it didn't have enough time to absorb the flavors.\n\nMango & Sticky Black Rice: Dessert rice isn't just for pudding!  The black rice added a nice aesthetic and felt heartier than white sticky rice.  Loved the thick coconut milk on top and fresh mango cubes on the side.  It really didn't feel any less healthy than an entr\u00e9e.", "author": "Adam B."}

We ordered the chili chicken, chili tofu and hot and sour soup.  All good to great.  Second time, we ate there and ordered the crispy crepe with shrimp (dried shrimp BTW), vegetable noodle soup, and again, chili chicken. All were bland even though we specified spicy.

I had the red curry which, again, had the perfect balance of flavors.\n\nAmbiance-\nA quaint place that you can easily pass by without realizing. There's maybe 30 seats in the place, so I would recommend making reservations. The service, for us, was impeccable. They were attentive, but not overly....we hardly even noticed them there.

It's a pretty standard Cambodian restaurant in the Bay Area, if you've been to some of the ones in Oakland and San Jose. Small restaurant and typically catered towards non-Cambodian tongues. That being said, it was pretty tasty and we found ourselves definitely satisfied after this meal.\n\nSour soup with chicken - This is a standard dish that I order when I go out. A dish that I grew up eating and something my mom always cooks when I return to Seattle. I do wish there was a catfish option and I wish there was some more flavor it in, meaning more of the tamarind flavor. The version at Phnom Penh House in Oakland is much better.\n\nAmok - Another friend of mine mentioned that it was probably the best amok she's ever had before, even in Cambodia. I'm not sure I would go that far, but it was definitely cooked very well. The fish was nice and tender; however I'm used to a little more custard to fish ratio. That being said, you're getting your money's worth with how much fish they give you in that little banana leaf.\n\nPumpkin curry - We really enjoyed this dish as the curry was nicely flavored but it came on a pumpkin shell that you could eat. That part really added to the dish as we were able to scoop delicious chunks of pumpkin with our curry. Yum.\n\nPrahok - A Cambodian staple, converted a bit to suit non native tongues. If you don't know what prahok is, it's a fermented fish paste that leaves a very pungent smell. It was mixed with ground pork and some coconut milk to reduce the pungency and used to dip various vegetables with it. Still pretty tasty!\n\nOverall, I do live in San Jose and would I return? I do prefer Phnom Penh House in Oakland (the one in Chinatown), but if I found myself in SF, craving Cambodian food I would definitely make a return visit.", "author": "Seila K."}

I was told that I can go to the kitchen and talk to the chef about the dish which I did. I went to the kitchen and asked the chef to make a beef sour soup dish for me. Yeah, I got my dish and it was pretty good.  Although it wasn't made the same way as in other Cambodian restaurants.  I ordered the crepe, prohak, beef sour soup (not on menu), catfish dish with vegetables, and fried banana with ice cream.  The crepe was very good.  I enjoyed all the other dishes but the prohak tasted different than what I am used to.  It was a bit sweet which I think caters more towards Thai people.  The beef sour soup had good flavors but the beef itself was a different texture.  Would recommend since this is probably the only Cambodian restaurant in SF.

I'd skip this as there are other places that make it way better... and its not even really Cambodian.\n- Pumpkin curry: Very flavorful with huge chunks of pumpkin. Could've been saucier.\n- Stewed pork: Not what we expected. More of a dip (with raw veggies) than a curry dish.\n- Whole fried tilapia: Not meaty enough and a little too salty.\n- Ahmok: Tastiest dish of the night, but small portion. The fish (and tofu?) was super tender, the curry mousse was delicious.\n- Claypot shrimp: A steamed pot of shrimp. Also not what we expected. The shrimp itself was deveined and not overcooked, but was a little bland.\n- Pad thai: Why this is being offered at a Cambodian restaurant is beyond me.

We eat with our fingers, not fork and spoon. So it was a great start. \n\nThe pumpkin curry is served in a pumpkin! Unlike other places, the pumpkin bowl carved from a pumpkin is edible. It's soft, and hard enough to hold the chicken, string beans, and asparagus. Love Love. \n\nThen is the fresh young coconut. Well nothing much to say about this drink.

Not the least of which is my love for Cambodian culture and food. It was my favorite country that I visited in SE Asia. The staff definitely convey that same vibe that I got for the people in Cambodia. Some of the most genuine, friendly, soulful, and warm people that I have ever met. Unfortunately, the food just did not really deliver here. \n\nWe had the prahok, ahmok (Cambodia's \"national dish\"), and the loc lac, which was not on the menu, but they said that the chef would make it for us anyway (so sweet of them!!!). Prahok was sort of a staple that I ate while there. It is essentially ground pork in this spicy, curry-ish sauce. I would get it in these little sandwich bags from street vendors and try to find a spoon to eat it with. Great little snack. This version was much more mild, less of the bold and oily flavors that I had in Cambodia. Not much in terms of chilies either. They served it with a plate of raw veggies as a dip, which was somewhat different that when I had it previously, but it was alright. Wifey was not a fan. \n\nAhmok is interesting because it is supposed to be the national dish, but we were hard-pressed to find it served anywhere we went in Cambodia. In fact, I have talked to Cambodian Americans that have never had it before and were unfamiliar with the dish. We finally found a place to make it for us and it was delicious. It is basically a red curry fish, but with a more coconut cream, making it a little thicker and richer. It comes in a banana leaf. This version was just very, very mild. It was not bad, but it was a very small portion and just lacked that flavor depth we hoped for. \n\nFinally, the loc lac was the best of the dishes. It was very different than the previous versions that I have had. It was served over lettuce, very similar to a Thai beef salad. Previous versions I have had were served sizzling, stir-fried with onions and some other veggies, but this one was more of a salad. I liked it a lot anyway, but it was not what I had expected. \n\nOverall, we ordered a very authentic Cambodian meal, which I love them for having. Many Cambodian restaurants in SoCal are Chinese and claim that Cambodian and Chinese foods are difficult to differentiate. Dishes like these, however, that are native to Camobodia (as far as I know) are not served there. They definitely get props for that as well as the amazing service and recreating a Cambodian vibe all the way over here. However, the food just was not amazing. It was good, but just not impressive enough to draw us back. Also, the portions were really small, especially considering the prices. We were hungry again later that evening. This was my first chance to really impress the wifey with the amazing food that I experienced over there and it just really didn't do the trick.

It's authentic, family-run and a nice change of cuisine from your typical Mexican/Italian/Chinese/Thai fare that are a dime a dozen.\n\nCame for dinner on what happened to be Valentine's Day (of course, looking around it didn't look as if anyone was really celebrating V Day.  Not that surprising as it's casual and not really the type of place you'd think of for a fancy or romantic dinner).\n\nStill, our hostess and server (who, by the way, was waiting on all the tables and quite efficiently, I might add) was dressed festively in red and went around lighting candles.  Sweet.\n\nEven sweeter was the food.  Loved the spinach leaves appetizer: individual spinach leaves served with little bowls of chopped lime, nuts, spices and dried shrimp.  You can literally taste every flavor and texture in this dish.  Amazing.\n\nAlso loved the Cambodian crepe appetizer: spiced meat and veggies wrapped in a light, flaky crust that soaked up all the juices.  \n\nThe spicy hot and sour soup with shrimp was also delicious with just the right amount of tanginess from the lemongrass.\n\nFinally, we had the pumpkin curry.  This one here was one of the nicely presented versions I had ever seen.  The serve the curry inside a half a peeled pumpkin bowl so that you can literally carve the pumpkin and have it gush out onto a larger bowl.  Beautiful and the curry was really good as well.\n\nReasonably priced and now a neighborhood favorite.  Can't wait to go back.", "author": "F. P."}

There's nothing I cherish more than coming to SF to eat exotic asian food, especially in far in the outskirts locations. Coupled with the glowing reviews on yelp as well as from trusted friends, I was really expecting something special. Unfortunately, each and every dish we ordered was about as meh as I could imagine.\n\nWe tried to order a smattering of the recommended items from other yelp reviews, baring the fish based dishes (since as much as I'd like to enjoy fish, for some reason I simply cannot unless it is raw).\n\nTo start, we had the spinach leaf appetizer. This came with toasted coconut, lime slices, peanuts, dried shrimp, ginger, peppers, and some sweetened lime / fish-sauce (similar to what you'd get at a Thai restaurant for dipping the fresh spring rolls in). Nothing here was that amazing, and I didn't find the sauce to really stand out. I did enjoy the lime wedges coupled with the dried shrimp, but half way through the app I had to stop, simply too bored to continue eating.\n\nNext they brought out the ginger mock chicken. We're not vegetarians, but I love seitan as much as the next man (hail seitan), and have been known to enjoy mock chicken/duck as much or more than the real thing at some Thai restaurants (well, not more than, but as a better chewy protein based option than chicken for some particular dishes). This dish actually reminded me of something you'd get out of one of those Thai frozen dinners that people in my office seem to love--bland, unimaginative, and not very tasty.\n\nThen, the charbroiled pork. This one was the favorite of the night, but only relatively. This one had some flavor that I couldn't place exactly, but in a good way. Overall pretty dry and not much dimension to it, but a satisfying porky chew. The mrs. loved the combination of the cabbage and pork (but as someone that grew up in a Russian household, of course she would).\n\nFinally, some pineapple fried rice came out. This was under salted and pretty bland. My pineapple fried rice kicks its ass up and down the street.\n\nNow, I have never been to Cambodia (but am dying to go) and have only heard amazing stories of the people and the food. Maybe tonight's experience was due to fish based dishes being the best on the menu (or the pumpkin that everyone raved about, but I couldn't bring myself to order due to my general distaste for pumpkin anything), or maybe it was due to too high expectations.

The food here reminded me of Thai food, and if you served me both, side by side, with a blindfold, I wouldn't be able to tell you which was which.  \n\nWe wanted to try something different in the area and decided on Angkor Borei.  I never had Cambodian food before and I'm always up for a new adventure.  We ordered some sort of noodle dish, egg rolls and a shrimp dish.  All of it came out well prepared and tasty, but there wasn't anything that made it stand out to me as a place I would need to come back to.\n\nThe place was pretty busy when we left and the patrons there seemed to be having a good time and looked like they'd been there before.  Again, nothing against the food (it tasted good and was prepared well), but it just didn't wow me.  When you're located in a city where restaurants are closing down just as fast as they're opening up, it's important to stand out from the crowd.

We started out with Spicy Hot and Sour Soup with shrimp. I had a Thai Iced Tea as well. \n\nThe soup was delicious. It was enough for each of us to have several bowls. You have to be careful when eating it though ... as it was served with lemon grass and sliced ginger with the skin on.. which I suppose you could eat.. but was a bit to tough to chew. In any case, it definitely enhanced the flavor of the soup but it wasn't apparent until you put it in your mouth that it wasn't truly edible. \n\nMy dining companion and I were very impressed with the Sauteed Seafood Combo .. although it was not as spicy as we expected it would be. It was served in a bowl and had mussels, shrimp, calamari, and fish ... all cooked to perfection. This dish was definitely worth coming back for. \n\nThe pumpkin curry was decent, but the duck seemed slightly overcooked and just didn't enhance the dish. The curry is served in a kabocha squash bowl and the curry was pretty good. I might try this on another occasion and see if it is better with a different meat. I was expecting to love this dish based on previous reviews.. but we left half of it uneaten. \n\nThe restaurant serves white, jasmine, and brown rice. We ordered white and brown rice, unfortunately they ran out of brown rice before they served our meal. They informed us of this and asked if white rice would be fine. \n\nThe service was OK. They were not very prompt in refilling the water glasses. There was a time or two where we needed to flag them in order to request some condiments.

The Sour Soup is awesome.  \n\nAll that said though, the rest of the menu really was pretty standard asian fare.., cashew nut chicken, basil chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc etc.   The beer selection is also decidedly Thai and Chinese - the only Angkor they serve is Anchor steam.\n\nI know what you are thinking, it's all very close to the same region, and that is true.

Thank You!\" all the way from our table back to the kitchen. Such humble people!\n\n4 stars for the food. This was the first time I had tried Cambodian cuisine, and it was delicious. The dishes were very similar to Thai and Vietnamese food. Our group of six was very open to the server's suggestions, so we basically left the ordering up to her. \n\nFor starters, we had the fresh spinach leaves which was served on a plate with 7 small bowls, each filled with different items: ginger, peanuts, lime wedges, red onion, chili, dried shrimp, toasted coconut. We filled our leaves of spinach with each item, topped it off with the chef's special tamarind sauce and popped them into our mouths. The items were all very complementary and the sauce gave it an extra kick. We also ordered the squid salad, which was very spicy and very tasty. My favorite starter was the crispy Cambodian crepe, the crepe skin was very crisp and the shrimp, ground pork, tofu, and bean sprouts inside were delicious.\n\nFor entrees, we got the chili chicken curry, charbroiled pork slices, ahmohk (a curry fish mousse served in a banana leaf), and dried beancurd with sauteed vegetables. The ahmohk was very unique, and I enjoyed the different textures. However, I don't think it was the winner at our table. Our server had suggested it, saying it was one of their most popular dishes. If you're looking for a different dish, then you should try it. The dried beancurd was so yummy that we ordered another one after we polished off the first one. The chicken and pork were also quite good, and are good \"safe\" items to order. \n\nFor dessert, we got an order of their fried banana with coconut ice cream and sticky mango rice. I was already stuffed from our meal that I could only manage to take a small bite out of both. The batter for the fried banana was a bit to heavy for my liking. The coconut ice cream was creamy and smooth. The mango rice was good, better than the one I've had at Osha Thai. \n\nOur bill arrived and it came out to $17 per person.

(I hadn't planned on delivery; the option was presented to me when I placed my order for \"pick-up\". I was startled into accepting the offer by the ease and comfort of its promise.)\n\nChecking the address on the outside of the house would take some time: doorway guards and 4 week old kittens to step over; stairs to descend; keys to add to the list of things to find in order that I might unlock the security gate, etc., so I searched a bit more...creatively. (I finally obtained the phone # after searching my email inbox - thank god for the gmail search function.) And he waited. I apologized and offered to call back after retrieving the information but he didn't accept the offer. So while I cannot review the restaurant's table service I CAN award the restaurant five stars for its exceptional telephone service.  \n\n(Rest assured, the house address and phone # now reside in my address book for quick reference when placing future phone orders, or in the case of burglary or fire.)\n\nOne additional note on the delivery service. After I placed the order I was told I could expect my food in 30-40 minutes. After hanging up I reconsidered my options and called back 7-8 minutes later asking that they hold my dinner for pick up - I would stop by the restaurant afterall, on the way back from a quick stop at the drug store. (Plus I wanted to take a peak at the restaurant's interior.) \n\n\"He's just left with your food.\" \n\nTruly, and I feel bad for thinking this now, I thought he was full of it. Figured he didn't want to change the order or track down the driver. But sure enough the buzzer rang 4 minutes later. How'd they do it? One reviewer calls this disconcerting. It's not disconcerting; it's f**king amazing. No stars will be deducted here for excellent food delivered in excellent time!!\n\nSo on to that excellent food.\n\nI ordered off of the menu posted on the their website. The vegetarian menu is listed at bottom, following the to-be-expected chicken, beef, seafood and pork items and the requisite soups and appetizers. Oh, and the fried noodles, fried rice, traditional Cambodian Noodles, \"Over Rice\", Vegetables and \"Vegetables and Meat\" items. And the asparagus (gets its own section) items. Just scroll down, all the way down -- but not past the bolded, highlighted notice that reads: RESTAURANT CLOSED JULY 1st- JULY 5th EVERY YEAR. Mark your calenders.\n\nThe vegetarian options are many. I chose the Crispy Crepe off the appetizer menu and the Clay Pot Mock Duck off of the a la carte menu.\n\nI tend to avoid the mock meat dishes because I am not a fan of them, generally, and I'm not a vegetarian who wishes to forget, however badly and briefly, that she's not eating meat. But I went with the mock duck after reading the positive reviews here and also because it contains both protein (the *duck* is wheat gluten) and noodles and I usually think about that sort of thing. The spearmint as listed ingredient also swayed me. I ordered the dish mild (it was; I might have chosen medium) and the mushrooms were left out of the dish as I'd requested. I poured it over my order of brown rice (nice to have this option) and marvelled all the way through it...that is, allowed numerous gasps of delight to astonish nobody in the house but myself and the crew of cats under my watch. \n\nThe vegetables in the clay pot dish were cooked to perfection and the coconut sauce was tops. Not too heavy. I might have considered pouring it over my shredded oats the following morning had I not polished it off in one sitting.\n\nThese dishes aren't bogged down in oils and are definitely more akin to Vietnamese than Thai. You FEEL less bogged down after eating this food. The taste is lighter than I expected but still so pleasing as there is no compromise in flavor. I felt positively healthy at the last bite, buoyant almost, although perhaps I should mention that I was sucking on a helium balloon in between bites.\n\nGarlic, ginger and mint were present but there were other spices at work which I couldn't identify because 1) this was my first Cambodian meal and 2) I'm no master of what constitutes a Cambodian kitchen.\n\nThe crepe was crispy around the edges but had a softer spongier center. Inside the crepe the bean sprouts were wonderfully crisp and the vegetables and tofu mingled nicely while each ingredient announced its individual presence. I felt satisfied after consuming this dish alone. \n\nAlso - big bonus: the leftovers tasted excellent for lunch two days later which is not often the case with similarly prepared foods.\n\nI greatly look forward to dining in the next time.", "author": "Michelle M."}

We shared the crepe with shrimp, the sour soup, and the crispy fish with bean thread noodle.  AMAZING!  The owner even recognized my friends, even though it's been awhile since they've eaten here.  As we were leaving, another patron who is a 'regular', started chatting with us and asked if this was our first time eating here.  We continued our conversation outside on the sidewalk, where she shared with us a lovely story about the owner finding her sister in Cambodia after many many years of thinking she was dead.

It was my first time trying Cambodian food as well.  There was quite some disappointment from my end.  Particularly the after-effects of eating this food.  I have two words to say: monosodium glutumate.  Tons of it.  Had the worst headache after eating the food here.  The clay pot was a waste of money.  I was expecting more from that dish.  There wasn't that kick as well with most of the dishes.  The one bright spot of the dinner was the Pan Fried Fish Fillet.  That was delicious and i recommend it if you like sweet dishes.\n\nAnyways, that's all i got to say about this place.  I might have to give this place another try, but most likely not.

It was tasty, but a bit of a one-note wonder: coconut-sweet and not very complex. Still, it was undeniably tasty and fun to eat. \r\n\r\nMy husband had the mixed seafood platter for his entree -- not terribly interesting in flavor, not very high-quality seafood, but plenty of mussels, squid, and shrimp. My entree, the beef curry, was very much like a traditional Thai massaman curry: Chunks of tender stewed beef in a coconut-based sauce with peanuts. It was good, but a little too much like the sauce of the appetizer in taste and consistency. I wish I would have known that when I ordered.\r\n\r\nService was a big issue. There only appeared to be one waitress (possibly the owner of the place) handling all the tables -and- all delivery  and to-go orders. It took a long time for her to take our order -- she apologized profusely and explained they just had too many to-go orders. Our food came out in about the time I'd expect, but our second round of beers never appeared. When she brought the check, she realized what had happened, and apologized again. There were a lot of cranky people in the room by this point, and the phone was ringing off the hook. As a result, we tried to be as nice to her as possible, and I left a nice tip. \r\n\r\nThis was our first visit, so perhaps this was a one-off experience. Maybe someone called in sick, maybe they got a positive mention somewhere recently... I dunno. But the whole atmosphere was really, really awkward.\r\n\r\nThe food was good overall -- sort of like Thai with a few unexpected twists and not as much chile. We'll probably go back and see whether we caught them on a bad night, but the food wasn't worth the hassle if this is par for the course.

That's not a complaint though, merely an observation. Angkor-Borei has been holding steady on the list for roughly 3 years. Cambodian cuisine is something I hadn't really investigated yet, so I was curious. As one would expect, close proximity to  Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam has produced dishes and ingredients that are familiar, but still different enough to constitute further investigation.\n\nDid I mention the delivery option? That's what finally got me to sample A-B's wares, wanting someone to bring me something to eat.\n\nI was helping the manfriend pack his belongings when we decided delivery was a must for the evening. The new owners at Rasoi aren't sure about delivery yet, so I pushed for A-B. We ordered red chicken curry ($8.50), chili beef ($8.25), and some steamed rice, dishes specified as spicy.  I'm intrigued by the curried fish mousse and some of the app.s, but I was looking for stuff that would travel well.\n\nCoconut milk added the yummy richness to the curry that I love, however, it was a thinner consistancy than most Thai curries. The curry brought home some points for having chicken that was not at all dry despite its whiteness and for it's still crisp veggies. Well executed, somewhat spicy, nice flavors.\n\nChili beef was a stir-fry type dish with assorted veggies, basil, and chilies. This dish was also prepared with care, as all ingredients were presented with appropriate textures and a nice level of heat. \n\nDelivery time was a little bit quicker than originally quoted.

It is milder and nuanced yet piquant, utilizing a lot less chili and a lot of coconut milk in a wide range of curries and noodle dishes, fish and fresh vegetables, as well as the ubiquitous prahok which is the uniquely Cambodian fermented anchovy paste.  My trip to Cambodia in 2005 opened me up to a whole new cuisine that I've quickly come to love.  First and foremost, the vibe at Angkor Borei brought me back to Cambodia from the decor to the incredible friendliness of the owner and staff.  However it was the food that takes center stage and brought back fond memories.  For a taste of something authentically Cambodian try the Stewed Ground Pork in coconut milk with spices and a touch of prahok, served with raw vegetables to dip into the stew.  Very good!  The owner recommended the Squid Salad.  Again not as spicy as the Thai version but damn tasty.  Also go for the Ahmohk, a mild curry fish mousse with prahok served in a banana leaf basket.

But the amhok is the dish that I dream about when I am back home and away from the bay area. The fish is perfectly steamed and the banana leaf imparts just the right amount of earthy sensuousness. It's reminiscent of the Parsi \"patra ni machi\" albeit with different flavors. But the banana leaf adds so much -- it reminds me of the smell of the earth just after a summer downpour. The basil, vinegar, and curry spices just add to the depth of flavors. Paired with some fresh coconut water (which, unfortunately, they run out of very often -- what's up with that??!), this could be my last supper and I would die with a perfectly contented soul (and belly).

Usually walk up to this cozy place for an incredibly unique dinner, but last night got delivery because it was raining and nasty outside. Cambodian food tastes like a cross between Thai and Vietnamese, and it's no wonder since the country is situated between the two countries. Personal faves include the pork larb, eggplant and tofu saute, fresh Spinach leaves- finger food that you make by filling bite sized leaves with ginger, peanuts, lime wedges, red onion, chili, dried shrimp, toasted coconut and the chef's sauce, squid salad, and butternut squash curry (a whole squash hollowed out with coconut milk curry).

Like many restaurants in San Francisco, this place was a whole in the wall. It was a decent place, just a little too dark inside for me. To start off I ordered the spicy hot and sour soup followed by some pad thai noddles and a dish of B.B.Q. chicken. I was expecting everything to be so delicious as I was told by couple of friends and family members that have been there plenty of times. Hmm.. well not exactly.. The noodles were great but the soup and the B.B.Q chicken not so great.  My friends and family were very surprised that it did not taste as usual.  I was a bit disapointed, not only they rushed to take our order they also kept dimming the lights from high to low about every ten minutes. That just gave us a clue to hurry up on eating and leave asap! RUDE! The waiter actually came too many times and that was annoying.

Totally friendly, and rather than giving me some weird look when I asked for no oil, the host said no problem and went back to relay the info to the cook. I was also really impressed that the version I wanted, sweet & sour sauce with veggies and pineapple, was listed on the menu as coming with mock duck, and they had no problem swapping in the mock chicken. It was customization with a smile.\n\nThe verdict? Assuming this was indeed mock chicken and there was no oil, it was unbelievably flavorful.

I mention this because you can't help noticing that you can get delicious food everywhere in Thailand, even from street carts, but once you get to Cambodia the food choices are dreary. Can I tell you about the time I got rice left over from another table and soup made from the bones of someone else's chicken? How about the time I ordered a chicken and saw them catch, kill, and cook a giant rooster that ended up being inedible tough. Or the numerous times I've eaten grey chunks of buffalo. Cambodia is a poor country and when you travel there you learn pretty quick to look for the expensive by Cambodian standards Chinese restaurants or the cafe's catering to western customers and even then you still get plenty of surprises, if you ever see a sign in Cambodia that says \"happy pizza\" on it go in and order a pizza with extra happy.\n\nThe reason I'm going into this whole tirade is because I can't tell you if Angkor Borei is authentic Cambodian food or not, it is not by my experience but I don't know what well off Cambodians have their cooks make for them or what the food was like before the country was ravaged by war and the Khmer Rouge. \n\nWe ordered the crispy Cambodian crepe; I thought it was interesting but just ok. The spicy green curry with BBQ duck that was not spicy, barely had a bite, and the duck was tender but we only got the boney parts. We ordered the seafood special which was the most expensive item on the menu and I was alarmed at how small the portion was, not enough for three people to each get get a decent taste. Finally since the portions were smaller than expected we ordered the Cambodian noodles. These noodles come with a bunch of vegetables and a sauce that you mix together yourself. I didn't care for it but my dinner companions did.\n\nQuite honestly I'd rather go to Pad Thai down the street and if it's Wednesday, Pad Thai's day off, I'd rather just go somewhere else.\n\nAngkor Borei is a decent restaurant but not really good enough to put in regular rotation.", "author": "Manny F."}

Another thing that happened just as we were leaving?  We discovered that right down the hill, on Courtland and Mission, was a Cambodian restaurant called Angkor Borei.  Cambodian - sort of like Thai, right?  Well, yeah, sort of, but really something quite different, too; at least the way they do it at Angkor Borei - lighter, subtler, with slightly different spicing.

This last time I was quite disappointed at the incorporation ( it wasn't subtle in taste) of celery into a beloved dish: samlaw machou.  It was the first time I had ever had the soup--here and in Cambodia--where celery was used.  Additionally, our chicken with ginger dish was more on the dry side--they decided to use white meat, and I've only had it with dark meat, so the meat seemed to be over cooked and not well integrated with the other spices and ginger strips. Perhaps the appeal is to a different clientele--not for those craving and wanting to taste a traditional home cook Khmer meal, away from home.  Please bring back a stronger presence of kroeung and flavorful dishes.  Cambodian is noticeably distinct and different from its neighbors: Thai and Vietnamese, for example.

My family and I have been going there since 1987, and the food is consistently excellent.  It's a must visit for out of town guests, who universally love it.\n\nThe food is similar to Thai food (but less agressively spicy) and Vietnamese food (but with more depth of flavor) with an emphasis on lemongrass, thai basil, mint, fish sauce, peanuts, and chilis.\n\nIf you go with a group, definitely try the spinach salad, which is delicious and fun to eat.  Other must try appetizers: beef kabobs, chicken salad, cambodian crepe, spicy tofu.   The spicy hot and sour soup is amazing, the green curry is deceptively mild at first, but packs a powerful cumulative heat punch, and the ahmohk (fish mousse) is a little taste of heaven in a banana leaf.\n\nThe service is warm and welcoming, and the price is right.

The wait staff are all kind and helpful. The couple who own the business are warm-hearted people who really care about their customers and want to provide a truly pleasant meal experience. They have been in business there for more than 20 years --- which in the competitive restaurant environment of SF means that they're good. For those who don't know what Cambodian food is, it's similar to Thai food. It's a very down-to-earth place, nicely decorated. If you call ahead, they can set up tables comfortably for a group of 10, 12, or so. It would be a little small for a really big group. It's on Mission Street, just north of Cortland Avenue, on the edge of Bernal Heights. Parking is a little tough (as it is almost everywhere), but we always find a spot.

Not a morsel left when the plate was taken away. The crepe was crispy and delicious, filled with ground pork, bean sprouts and other wonderful tidbits. The noodle dish we ordered was not very interesting looking but it turned out to be a very tasty dish. It has rice noodles with egg, bean sprouts, green onions and tofu. Next to the noodles was a pile of shredded cabbage and chopped peanuts to add to your serving. A very clever and fresh tasting dish.\nThe finale was the fish ahmook. I'm drooling just trying to describe it.\nIt is a fish mousse with a mild curry sauce poured over it, inside a folded banana leaf.

Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863. Cambodia became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the remaining leaders are awaiting trial by a UN-sponsored tribunal for crimes against humanity. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed.\r\n\r\nclass is dismissed, bitches!\r\n\r\n**had a pretty bad day yesterday and it was still 5 stars delicious.  that's just an fyi**", "author": "Laura B."}

When I'm too tired to trek out to the foothills of Bernal Heights, I call Angkor Borei and within an hour, I have an incomparable Cambodian meal waiting on my doorstep. I always start with one of their delicious appetizers, like the crispy rice chips with ground pork, super-fresh green papaya salad, delicious crispy crepe, or beef kabobs with a tangy peanut sauce. For mains, I love the beef curry in a thickened coconut milk with peanuts, the red curry shrimp with spinach, the fried fish fillets with garlic sauce, and the cashew chicken. You really can't go wrong with anything there, although I have found a few of the seafood dishes to be, as Calvin Trillin says, not highly seasoned. Add some Cambodian noodles on the side and some of the best white rice I've ever had (chewy, nutty, and delicious) and you're set. The service, both over the phone, at your front door, and at the restaurant, is attentive.", "author": "Jon L."}

I've never had Cambodian food before but my friend had spent a week there last year.  Overall, we thought it was a good dining experience, especially for the price.  All of the staff were friendly and attentive considering how busy they were.  The fresh spinach rolls were cool because you make it yourself.  All of the ingredients--roasted coconut, ginger, lime, jalapeno, dried shrimp, red onion, peanuts and sauce--came in little bowls for you to add to the spinach and then roll yourself.  The combination of flavors was really good.  The sour beef and ginger chicken were good but didn't seem like they were the signature dishes.  Next time I'll have to try something else.  One reviewer said there was MSG but we didn't think there was much, if any.  It's worth checking out, especially if you live in the general area.", "author": "Jason G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-07", "description": "After first eating at this restaurant i was amazed how good Ankor Borei's food was. Now seven years later, the food is still as good as it was the first time when my cambodian girlfriend took me there. My girlfriend so happens to be the restaurant owners daughter, but my biased cannot be persuaded by my taste buds. My favorite is the sour soup(dont remember the name). Pour that over your rice and you have a unique blend of flavor that ive never experienced before. As i am fairly new to many other cultural foods I usually stick to the typical american-thai/ cambodian food, but they have things on the menu for all those adventurers out there also. People shouldn't expect to taste authentic cambodian/thai food if they order something as simple as curry chicken as most restaurants cater to the usual eating styles in order to keep a broad customer base. But anywho, I love coming to this place and am always pleased how pleasant the workers are about accomodating all needs.", "author": "Jay S."}

We started with the cold noodle salad with some kind of fish dressing, it was really good and different. Then we had the Ahmohk which I ordered based on other yelp suggestions, it was amazing, very flavorful and the texture is not bad as any mousse would be. We also had a ground pork dish in a curry-type liquid, it was good but not as good as the fish. The waiter recommeded we have some dessert, stiky rice with mango, but this was not your typical thai white rice, it was black rice which gives it a nutty flavor that is better than the thai version. this all went down with shinga, super good!", "author": "Ivette M."}
