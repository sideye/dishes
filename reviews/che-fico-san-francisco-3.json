I discovered this place because I walk by it from the bus stop almost every day and I see these insane lines so I figure we should try it. The plan was just to wait in line but my friend snagged us a reservation which was way better because when we arrived 15 minutes after it opened the place was already slammed. \n\nBeautiful, open, airy restaurant, not crammed together. I also discovered the chef is of Jewish heritage and a lot of his dishes are Jewish cooking inspired.\n\nWe ordered a salumi plate (incidentally they have a massive curing chamber in the middle of the restaurant), which was very tasty.\nTHis was followed by the Chicken liver pate which was incredibly tasty and paired well with sliced radishes.\nFor our mains we shared the seafood pasta with squid ink and sea urchin. Very fresh tasting and a nice lemony finish. We also shared the Pinepple pizza which is very spicey with a sweet aspect.\n\nService and cocktails were excellent, would recommend.", "author": "Jordan C."}

Yes the place is cute. Yes I can see the salumi curing against the wall. Yes they have some special pizza oven from Italy. But the food is good not great, and the portions are pretty small.\n\nHad a nice catch up with a friend and ordered a bottle of wine. We started off with the selection of salumi, which did not come with any bread or anything. It was good, but doesn't really compare to what you get in Italy or Spain. Next was the pappardelle al ragu. The pasta was nicely al dente, but the bolognese fell flat. The meat was congealed and uninspired, and there was not enough sauce. The much hyped pineapple pizza was decent, but the portions were like 50% crust 50% toppings. And even with the warning from the server that the crust is supposed to be charred, I still found it too burnt for my liking. I would definitely avoid the side of escarole. The menu made it seem like it was mostly escarole, but it was like 75% black eyed peas, and it was way too salty.\n\nA decent meal, but over-hyped and overpriced.", "author": "Eva W."}

I tried my hardest to nab a reservation but to no avail. Open Table only offered a few weekday times at very inconvenient times. (Dude I like to eat at normal hours so I can go to sleep at a reasonable time. Yes I realize I sound like an old lady. : )) The only way to be able to dine there was to go line up like everyone else; so we did. We got there half an hour before it opened and there were already 15 people ahead of us. Fortunately, when they finally opened, the line moved fast and we got to sit at the bar area. It wasn't our first choice, but it was tolerable since we were hungry. \n\nChe Fico is located on Divisadero Street in the Nopa area of San Francisco. I got dropped off to wait in line first while my guy went to find parking. Luckily he found a space a few blocks away. It's mostly street parking and there are some streets which don't have meters. \n\nDid our dinner meet our expectations? Ummm...not really. I would say the food was good but not as fantastic and memorable as I hoped. The environment and ambience is better than the food. The pretty and modern interior makes this place a hip place to have drinks with some friends or co-workers. Other than that, I would say I'm glad I tried it at least once. If I were to go again, I would just go for drinks after I had already eaten somewhere else. I must say I did like the wallpaper by the stairs leading up to the dining room. All those figs! So pretty! \n\nSuccotash : This was sweet corn with strands of shishito peppers and a small piece of eggplant on top. The flavors were good but only because I really like corn. The eggplant was just ok. \n\nPappardelle al Ragu : The pappardelle was good, but it's just as good at other Italian restaurants in the city. The portion is what somewhat irked me. For the price I thought there was going to be another few more pieces? I believe there were only about 5 or 6 pieces on the plate. (I'm definitely not eating like I'm on a diet.) It looked like a lunch portion instead of dinner. I suggest ordering more than one if you want to be sufficiently full. \n\nPineapple Pizza : This pizza was the one I was looking forward too the most because of all the photos others have posted. The pizza is baked in their wood-fired ovens in the kitchens. The crust is cooked to almost burnt hence the dark color. If you don't like the burnt flavor, I wouldn't suggest ordering it. The pizza is a bit sweet from the pineapple, but I thought it was tasty and an interesting mix of ingredients on a pizza. If I had to order a pizza, I would probably order another kind the next time. \n\nPluot : This was a complimentary dessert. It was the first time I had one. It's like a cross between a plum and a peach.", "author": "Julie W."}

Though I should premise that with, I do love Italian food more than most types of food, so there may be a bias there. \nFirst off, I definitely recommend getting a reservation unless you're cool waiting 2-3 hours for dinner. We made one and were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time. We then were told that some of their items had run out, which was a little disappointing, but since they get all their produce fresh each day, I guess it was understandable. We ended up ordering the suppli to start, which the waiter highly recommended, and it was great! We then did the linguini with clams, the wood fired chicken, creamy polenta and the seasonal vegetable they were offering! It was all amazing, and I especially loved the pasta. Hands down the greatest plate of pasta I've eaten in the city. \n\nCan't wait until I get to eat here again!", "author": "Sonia S."}

We had a lovely dining experience, and I don't think the restaurant is \"over-hyped\" as many of these reviews seem to suggest. Yes, it's hard to get a table. Yes, it's pricey. But it delivers! To me, all of this was worth it for the delicious flavors and great service.\n\nCustomer service was the star from the beginning as we had requested seating with a booth or banquette seat for me. I am hugely pregnant and no longer comfortable sitting on small wooden chairs for long periods of time. They obliged and seated us at a nice table where one side was banquette seating for me. Very comfortable.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 tried some salami and the quince cocktail, neither of which I could indulge in while pregnant. He said they were both great. The cocktail smelled like fall and warm apple pie. I was jealous!\n\nWe ordered the suppli to start, which was delicious! I've had arancini type fried risotto at many places, but this was the best I have tried. It had delicious tomato and herb flavor, and the cheese was gooey and had a nice nutty flavor.\n\nFor the pasta dish we shared a squash ravioli. It was very seasonally appropriate, with gorgonzola, chestnuts, fried sage, and brown butter. More tastes of fall! Small portion for $28, but very tasty.\n\nAs a main dish we split the porchetta, and it was a revelation! Honestly this pork had some of the best flavors I have tasted in a long time. We were treated to a huge round of perfectly roasted pork loin coated in yummy seasoning, with a layer of melty fat in between that and the crispy skin. Oh my god the crispy skin! Positively sinful! It was a HUGE portion, and we couldn't finish it between the two of us.\n\nFor dessert we shared the warm chocolate cake with limoncello gelato. The cake was like a brownie outside, with a steamy, gooey inside. So decadent! Topped with limoncello gelato and a sprinkling of sea salt, it was a strange combination but it totally worked! \n\nOur server was excellent, and the pacing of the meal was perfect. Dishes came out quickly, with just the right amount of time between courses. The space is beautiful and interesting, and the soundtrack was fun and upbeat. I would definitely come back here.", "author": "Traci R."}

One of our dinning partners doesn't do cheese so we did ours without cheese....big mistake. The ingredients were great though.\n\nHits:\nOur chopped salad was Fantastic!! Great ingredients, super fresh, with touches of salty Finocchiona and cubed smoked provolone. Great salad and highly recommended.\n\nThe Smoked Paprika Strascinati was amazing. Every savory bite begged for more. Perfect Al dente pasta, an amazing Lamb Sugo...I would get this again without hesitation as it was unique but super tasty!\n\nIf you come order a meat dish!!! Period end of Story. These guys do meat amazingly. We ordered both the Lamb, which I must say was the best and most unique I have ever tasted...simply magnificent, and the Porchetta...which was pork heaven. The crispy skin ( think Cracklins) and rich juices are what pig dreams are made of.\n What is funny is this is a Jewish Italian restaurant that highlights Kosher dishes on the menu....oops!\n\nMezzo  Mezzo:\n\nThe corn succotash was fine but there are many other dishes that proved better. The meat dishes come with veggies so I would pass if you order one.\n\nBoth the desserts were fine but something you could pass on. I did enjoy the Nuvola Di Riso but it is not your traditional rice pudding. The deep dish crostata was warm and filled with lovely fruit and once again enjoyed it but unremarkable\n\nMisses:\n\nThe Duck liver was great and pretty to look at, it reminded me of how my mother used to make it, however it was a minuscule portion and not worth ordering again.\n\nThe Cod in Pasta shells was fishy and not a plentiful serving. No one at the table enjoyed it....definitely pass on it.\n\nThe wine list is good but a tad bit spendy. Corkage is a bit high at $30 but they will decant and did offer so.\n\nAmbiance is fantastic as the space is just gorgeous. You can tell they spent a lot of money re-purposing an old stable into a stunning restaurant and bar. Music was great, albeit Loud, from the 80's ( Talking Heads, Stones, Blondie et al). And the music reflected much of the patrons...uh hum like in their 50s and 60s. Sure the bar was the youngings scene.\n\nI will definitely go back again but order more with a focus.\n\nBuon Pasto!!!", "author": "David G."}

I mean, I loved staying up late in college, and generally still do.  But these days, staying up late means switching back and forth between IG and twitter on my phone while lying in bed.  I really got caught up in FOMO when Che Fico opened, so I went for one of the late night reservations.  I really wanted to enjoy it, but I was so sleepy that I couldn't appreciate the food as much as I should have.  I mean it was good, but I didn't know at the time if it was outstanding.  \n\nIt took a long time for me to come back after that first late night visit, but boy was it worth it.  This time I had a reservation close to opening with my significant other and we absolutely loved every part of the experience.  Upon arrival, we stood in the long line of walk-ins, but the hostess asked if anyone had a reservation and invited us to come to the front.  After checking in, we were brought to our table near the kitchen which was great for viewing not only all the action of food prep, but also had a view of the bar and could see all the activity.  This is a really loud place, but I love the music they play so it wasn't a big deal to me.\n\nThere are so many things on the menu I wanted to try and our server was so helpful with giving us recommendations, especially with the pizza and the special that night, roasted veal chop.  Now the suppli and prosciutto cotto wrapped grissini were good as small starters.  The honey on the prosciutto was a nice touch, giving just enough of a sweet/savory balance.  They must have suppli on deck in the kitchen because those came out so quickly and I could see them being placed on almost every table.  Cheese was nicely melted inside, but not so much that they burned your tongue or anything.  Again, great flavor.\n\nThe saffron spaghetti was perfect.  The pasta had a nice bite to it and the sauce was just the right amount that clung to the pasta evenly.  Lobster was cooked well and was sweet.  I could eat this everyday.\n\nThe squash blossom pizza was amazing.  I was so glad the server recommended this one because I wouldn't normally go in this direction, probably leaning more towards the meat heavy ones.  But the combination of the squash blossom with the bagna cauda was so delicious, and that crust!  Wow, what a great bite!\n\nOur final course was the roasted veal chop, the special of the night.  If they mention they have the veal chop available, GET THIS!  I could not believe how perfect this veal tasted.  I'm not one to get veal, but the meat was perfectly cooked with a tenderness and juiciness that was delicious.  I had to cut every piece off of that bone and was tempted to knaw every last piece off.  Even the staff were coming up to us mentioning how jealous they were that we had it because it sounded amazing to them when they found out it was going to be available.  I felt bad that they didn't have a taste before opening, but I think they mentioned they only had 7 or 8 available for the night.  Yay me!\n\nDessert looked ok on the menu, but we passed as we decided to go to their new sister restaurant downstairs to try some pie (another review coming shortly).  That didn't stop them from bringing us some peaches and some cookies from said downstairs restaurant with the check.  Nothing better than having snacks to go after such a delicious meal.\n\nService was good with no mishaps.  The chef went around to a few tables to check if people were enjoying their meals.  I wish he came to our table to I could thank him for the veal.  Maybe next time.  And yes, there will be a next time!  Make sure to get a reservation and come with friends so you can try more items together.

So, as I was planning a trip to San Francisco, I knew I had to make a stop here. I was especially excited because Bon Appetit magazine had named it one of the best new restaurants in America. So, I woke up at 3am (midnight Cali time), to make my reservation the second they opened up. The restaurant take reservations 30 days out. \n\nWhen you walk in the door, you immediately go up a flight of stairs to get to the hostess stand. The tiled floor was gorgeous. The walls were lined with a loud, fig printed wallpaper. Cured meats were on full display. The restaurant was buzzing, and all the seats were full. I loved the fresh ambiance, especially the old school hip hop that was playing. I thought the restaurant was Italian, but the menu actually describes it as Jewish-italian. \n\nI was seated shortly after my reservation time of 8:30. When I made the reservation on open table, I had requested \"counter seating\", which was right up against their open kitchen. It was fun because we got a front row seat to the chefs in action. I would definitely suggest trying that out. The rest of the restaurant had some some tables and then some larger tables for communal seating. \n\nWe were immediately greeted and asked to please put in our complete order. \n\nWe started with the small chopped salad, which was a large enough portion to share between two people. It was a sort of classic italian salad with mixed greens, olives, chick peas and cheese. This was delicious. It had a nice zest to it.\n\nI kept seeing the fried risotto at everyone's table, so we tried an order of that. It was only $5, so why not? It came out, and it was barely hot, and honestly not that great. We shared one order (one fried ball), and didn't even finish it. \n\nWe opted for pasta, as we were craving a nice hearty sauce. They just weren't that good. The presentation was gorgeous, but unfortunately it looked way better than it tasted. The portion sizes are small, so this is definitely the type of restaurant where you can order a few items and try a bunch of things, but we just weren't impressed, so we decided against trying anything else. \n\nThe restaurant staff was really nice, and they brought out some free cookies/ dessert for us because we were celebrating. \n\nOverall, the service was good, the restaurant itself has a great vibe and is really beautiful, but the food just didn't measure up to my high expectations.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-30", "description": "My two friends and I made reservations nearly a month in advance and we could still only get seats at 10pm on a Friday night. The day of, we wistfully tried to walk in multiple times starting from when they open at 5:30pm and were repeatedly told that the wait would be four hours. The most amusing part is that the staff say this as if it's a normal thing to wait four hours for a meal. It wasn't entirely devastating since we already had reservations, but the strangest part is that some guests who were told this appeared to be nonplussed and calmly headed over to the bar to kill time. For four hours?! Still confused. In any case, definitely make reservations if you plan to go. \n\nFor all the hullabaloo, I would sum Che Fico up as average delicious fancy food but in a stellar physical environment. I absolutely adored the ambiance and aesthetics. The first thing one notices when one enters the staircase leading up to the restaurant is the colorful fig wallpaper. Once in the dining area, everything is transparent and hence one feels immersed in the cooking experience: there is a smoker filled with meats against one wall, and one can watch the numerous staff assembling every dish in the well-lit kitchen area. The standout element to me were the staff's tasteful coordinated floral dress code and bandanas, cohesive but not the typical matchy-matchy. \n\nMy friends and I shared the gazpacho, pasta with bolognese sauce, squash flower pizza, and potatoes with lamb drippings. Everything was good, but not nearly as mind-blowing as the price would suggest. The gazpacho was probably the most notable dish, a cool smooth tomato-y puree with fresh vegetables and fruit pieces at their peak ripeness. The pasta was delicious but the portion of maybe six to seven noodles total was painfully small. I liked the sharpness of the cheese on the pizza. The potatoes were completely unremarkable, literally a large goblet of baked potatoes. At the end of the meal, they gave us wedges of a special hybrid peach and plum, which tasted exactly like what one imagine given the description, and yummy. The waiters did their job but weren't particularly hospitable, for being at a fancy restaurant. Definitely an impressive date spot, but the food itself is not extraordinary so don't get unduly swayed by the hype.", "author": "Amy G."}

She came over and with her help, we ordered the Indian Summer Insalata, the Pear and Lonza, Papparadelle, and the Zuckerman pizza. My dad also got a glass of wine. \n\nThe lady gave my dad a glass of wine that was 18$ and barely filled at all. It was probably 3.5 ounces and this was just aggravating, unnecessary, and not a good way to start off the meal. \n\nOur first course was the pear and lonza. It was very average, expensive, and the portions were TINY. The pear was very hard and the prosciutto was flavorless. My dad and I were convincing ourselves that it was worth the $12 and the months of waiting. This was not easy.\n\nThe waitress finally came over with the tomato salad, and we were hopeful about this one, considering that the restaurant dedicated a whole paragraph talking about how the \"Dirty Girl tomatoes\" are still in season and very flavorful. \n\nThe tomatoes were not fresh at all and the cheese tasted cheap and not high quality. The peppers and the beets were super hard and tasteless. Again, the portions were small once again and the salad was $18! \n\nAt this point, we were really regretting our decision to come to the restaurant, and we asked the waitress if she put the rest of the dishes that we ordered in and she said she did.  \n\nNext, the pasta came. It was TINY and it was $28!! The pasta was overcooked and the meat sauce was mediocre. We decided at this point that it was not worth waiting for the last dish, and we decided to pay and leave.\n\nThe waitress came over and we informed her of our decision. Within a few minutes, a manager came over and asked us why we decided to leave. She defended the portions, and claimed that they \"measure the wine to be exactly 5.5 ounces\" and that the \"portions are small because they are meant to share\" which doesn't even make any sense. The restaurant was unapologetic and the bill was still 70$ for barely any food,  food that wasn't even good!\n\nI really don't like overrated places and this place definitely fits into that category.

Our reservation was at 5:45PM.  We arrived at the restaurant at 5:47PM and was seated right away.  It took until 6:04PM for a server to finally greet us and she thought we already had our drink orders (no, false... no one said anything to us for a while).  That's usually recoverable since the servers did seem to be in the weeds.  And honestly, this is really all about the kitchen because between our appetizer and our entree, it took almost an hour to get our food.  We had a manager-like lady swing by asking if we liked our food, but the food came out soooo slow that it wasn't enjoyable.  She later came by to say \"oh, I told the kitchen you'd like your food paced faster,\" but she failed to recognized that we've waited an hour between our super fast appetizer and our next course. Of course, after we've mentioned the timing, all of the sudden the rest of our food came out.\n\nFor appetizer, we tried their Salmon Crudo, which was good and it came out fast.\n\nOur entrees were:\n* Spaghetti Arrabbiata - the pasta was undercooked (and no, it was not al dente, a bit harder than that), the sauce was spicy so they were not kidding with the chili.\n* Garganelle - this was recommended by our server because the pasta is made in-house and allegedly takes a long time to make.  It was okay.  Not memorable, but this one was filling.\n*  House-made Mortadella, Ricotta Cheese, Pistachio, Avocado Blossom Honey pizza - this was the second best thing I had.  The pizza is legit there and the mortadella was very flavorful.\n* Polenta - this was solid, but if they failed this... I have no words.\n\nDessert:\n* Pistachio gelato - the only thing they did correctly here.  The gelato is solid and the pistachio was very flavorful.  \n\nOverall, I do not recommend this place.  I came here because a friend said they have \"life-changing pasta\" and honestly the only thing that changed for me was my appetite for this place.  The reservation was difficult to come by (we asked Amex to secure it for us) and I just don't see the hype.  Yes, it's a trendy place for now, but if you're going to be trendy, let's cook the pasta correctly and learn how to pace the food at a more reasonable time.", "author": "Sandy H."}

The cocktails were on point, mouthwatering really with amazing flavors.  To start, we got the chopped salad, which I really enjoyed and loved the big chunks of cheese and salami and much more! The Sardines with the beautiful tomatoes and balsamic were delectable.  \n\nWe then shared a pizza with yummy toppings, including my favorite *Pineapple* haha so naturally I enjoyed it.  I do have to mention that crust is usually my favorite part of a pizza (not really, but I do LOVE the crust) and this pizza's crust was extremely burnt and so large that you lost about half of the pizza.  We also shared the chicken and it was pretty good but definitely nothing spectacular. \n\nI do have to mention that I was pretty disturbed by the $65 Gnocchi on the menu, which was super disappointing to me because I really love Gnocchi, it is actually my favorite pasta but I felt bad ordering it because it was so expensive and didn't make sense. The waiter mentioned that it was small and he had complaints that the dish only had 8 pieces (which I believe to be accurate although I would be extremely disappointed if so).  He also said that it contains 8 grams of Black Truffle, which is about a gram per gnocchi. IDK about all of this. HAA\n\n\nRegardless, our waitor was amazing and so fun with the best personality. he definitely made sure we had a great experience and was a large part in my phenominal experience!

Since getting a reservation for a normal dinner time is near impossible, they went in first on Friday, August 10th before 6pm to put our names down. Our party of four ended up seated around 7:45pm at a communal table. While waiting, we went down the street to a bar for a few drinks. I believe they texted us when the table was ready.\n\n*WOOD FIRED OCTOPUS SALAD: Fiddler's Green Farm marbled potatoes, fennel, parsley & chili flake ($24)\n*GRILLED CHOPPED DUCK LIVER: onion marmalatta, purple daikon, pickled onions, roman matzo ($13)\n*SPAGHETTI ALLA CHITARRA: Australian black truffle, pecorino romano ($45)\n*PAPPARADELLE AL RAGU: bolognese, 48 month parmigiano reggiano ($28)\n*PIZZE: SUNGOLD TOMATO, DOUBLE 8 DAIRY MOZZARELLA, BASIL, CACIOCAVALLO ($20)\n*OLIVE OIL CAKE - ELDERFLOWER GELATO, STRAWBERRIES, LIME ($13)\n*DEEP DISH BERRY CROSTATA - WOOD FIRED, BROWN BUTTER CRUMBLE, FIOR DI LATTE GELATO, SEMOLINA, SALT ($14)\n*BERRIES: mint, smoked maple, ver jus rouge, chocolate bitters, gran classico, gin ($16)\n*KUMQUAT: cappelletti, dry vermouth, prosecco ($10) x2 \n*CAFE: cold brewed coffee, montenegro, sweet vermouth, absinthe, rum ($14)\n*Guido Porro Dolcetto d'Alba 'Vigna Pari', 2016 Piedmonte ($53 bottle)\n*Caravaglio Malvasia delle Lipari Passito ($20 glass)\n\nMy favorite dish ended up being the pizza. The crust had this wonderful soft chew. And I loved that there was cheese on the crust as well. The octopus salad was also tasty. Tender and chewy. I love liver, but this dish was a little too sweet for me. And the liver itself was a little irony. The truffle pasta was really disappointing. It had a strong bleach-like smell which was off putting. I don't know if it was coming from the actual plate or the pasta, but it ruined the experience of a truffle pasta as I love the smell of truffles. The papperadelle was better. Though I wanted more meat and sauce. Both pastas were a good al dente. I'm not big on desserts, so I thought both were okay. My cocktail was light and fruity which I was in the mood for, so it worked in this instance. They gave us Salted Fruit at the end of the meal. I can;t do sweet and savory, but everyone else seemed to like it.\n\nOverall, I think the food was okay. I know this is one of the new hot spots, so I'm glad I checked it out. But I'd only come back for that pizza. The pastas definitely fell short.", "author": "Elena N."}

It seems like there is consensus on this based on the long lines to score walk-in seating. If you're able to secure reservations ahead of time, that is highly recommended. Otherwise, you'll need really nice friends like mine, who work in the city and can haul a$$ to wait in line before the restaurant opens at 5:30pm. Unfortunately, your entire party needs to be present before they will actually seat you. We JUST made it in the nick of time to score the last table. We tried:\n\n-Wood Fired Octopus Salad (Marbled Potatoes, Fennel, Parsley, Chili Flake, $24, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uSzGrvfsuVIaqf3j0d4fTA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Delicious- the octopus was super tender and cooked perfectly. I loved the pairing of ingredients in this dish- highly recommended!\n-Melon & Lonza (Bergamont Mint, Avocado Blossom Honey, $15, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rCOrJKyikZuvCTMLgoE-wg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The melon was super ripe and juicy, but the house cured lonza wasn't quite fatty enough to hold it's own against the melon. I would have preferred Lardo instead, but my tastes skew towards the fattier foods. Still recommended.\n-Suppli (Fried Risotto, Tomato, Fontina, $5/each, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qsvMmVrOQKNA9idzhB-dLQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok, but worth trying once. I thought this was basically an oblong shaped aracini- rich and creamy on the inside and very crunchy on the outside. It was a little overfried for my liking though- skip!\n-Warm Beef Tongue (Salsa Verde, Crispy Capers, Celery, Pickled Mustard Seeds, $14, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hZDuK88P3qJNKC1C0a9qMg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The beef tongue was cooked really well, and super tender. I loved the salsa verde, but the capers and pickled mustard seeds made this dish a little too acidic overall. I would have preferred the mustard flavor in a different format. This dish is worth trying once though.\n-Spaghetti alla Chitarra (Australian Black Truffle, Pecorino Romano, $45. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IzF8bluYT_L8v29JGdloFg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yes, this dish costs $45, but they give you a heap of shaved black truffle on your pasta. The pasta is also freshly made, and cooked al dente, so it has that great chew. This was one of my favorite dishes- highly recommended!\n-Pineapple, Red Onion, Fermented Chili Pizza ($20, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5I7jFq39nTj-Kq0OBOTCrg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I loved the toppings on this pizza, and that it had some spice to it. However, the crust was way too thick, and there wasn't enough topping to crust ratio. This pizza is still worth trying once though. \n-Che Fico Wood Fired Chicken (Agrodolce, Chilies, Onions, Creamy Polenta, For 2/$29, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CXo7f4xT--3hBRnkm-_56g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The chicken was roasted perfectly, and juicy and moist. However, the agrodolce was leaning too acidic for me, and I wish they paired the chicken with another sauce. The polenta was really good, and very creamy and rich. \n-Side of Succotash ($8, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7ENqZLrkzPBVxtgQ7rK9tw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok, and again, there was a lot of acid in this succotash. They only give you one small slice of grilled eggplant, so this dish is mostly corn- skip!\n-Complimentary Dessert: Pluots w/Sea Salt & Chili Powder (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=q-jsxVQNxNY10BZTIui04A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- who knew such a simple combination would be so delicious? The crunch of the pluots went well with the salt and chili.\n\nService was solid, but not very warm. I'm not sure if our server smiled at all during our meal, but he was efficient. However, he disappeared towards the end of our meal, and we had to flag him down a few times to ask for the check, etc. We decided to skip dessert since none of their options looked that great. \n\nOverall, this was a very good dining experience, and Che Fico has an extensive menu, so I'll have to be back to try more pasta and pizza dishes.

We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited. The cocktail server demanded a credit card when we ordered the drinks. We were then seated at our table, but my credit card was not returned. When our drinks were brought out, the hostess asked for the last name on the card. I thought she was going to run it for the drinks and bring it to me. Nope. After 45 minutes I asked our server to rescue my card. He acted like this was an obscene request, and shoved my card at me when he returned. When I enthusiastically thanked him and said I had been worried I would forget the card, he flatly said, \"I see.\" and walked away.\n\nIn general, our main server was surly and rude. He cut me off when I was trying to order. He continually walked away while people at the table were mid-sentence ordering beverages. A second server was clearly sick and coughing into her hands all night and chugging from a water bottle she kept on the counter where dishes were placed by the kitchen for service. She kept touching her face and hair while running dishes to tables.\n\nTwo appetizers came out, and then we waited nearly an hour for the pasta dishes and the rest of the meal. One of the dishes we ordered never arrived. No explanation whatsoever. Due to the massive gap between courses, we were the last table at the restaurant. We were not offered desert, and a second server tried grabbing the plates away while we were still eating--TWICE!\n\nThe food itself was nothing special and definitely overpriced. I also bit into a bone chip in the pizza which was incredibly unappetizing.", "author": "Gianna S."}

They do have seats at the bar if you want to go the first come first serve route.\n\nI imagine that if I ever opened a restaurant...it would be something like this.  I loved the feeling, the ambiance, open kitchen, and cured meats within view.  What really brought everything together was the service.  I absolutely loved our servers.  Both were super attentive, friendly, informative, and just made our evening special.  \n\nWe started off with the chopped salad.  I loved the fresh ingredients, cubes of cheese, and cured meat.  I thought everything came together really well and I'd definitely order it again.\n\nWe also went with the octopus and pork belly antipasti.  I was really impressed with how the octopus was cooked.  I'm normally not a fan of cooked octopus but in this rare moment, I thought the octopus outdid the pork belly.  I can't believe I just said that!\n\nNext was the pineapple pizza.  So the pizza was definitely different.  They focus on their wood fired crust which may come across as burnt but really went well as far as flavor with the rest of the ingredients.  Every ingredient appeared to be ridiculously fresh and appreciated that.  It does have a kick so beware if you can't handle spice. \n\nWe also ordered the handmade orecchiette which was delish.  Again, every ingredient stood out and it was a highlight of the evening. \n\nFor dessert, we opted for the chocolate budino and olive oil cake.  Out of the two, I liked the olive oil cake better.  Once again, I was never a fan of olive oil cake but it was delicious here.  \n\nThey don't have their salume plates yet as they are trying to perfect the process.  From what I was told, they are going to hire someone who is completely focused on the cure meats to ensure that every plate comes out to a high standard.  I can appreciate that.\n\nI can see why reservations are so difficult to get here.  I am in love with this spot and can't wait to come back.

I'm a long time Josey Baker fan, & who doesn't love fried cheese?  But it was heavy handed, w the cheese overpowering everything; not to mention being difficult to cut through.

The best preparation of duck liver that I've EVER had.  \n\nThe olive oil cake was a perfect finishing touch.

Che Fico, welcome to the city and I'm so glad you're here. After many years of this place trying to get open, it finally opened it's doors a few weeks ago and seems to be the talk of the town. Long waits to get a table, reservations booked out for months and deservedly so...\n\nI was able to get a table last Thursday with a friend of mine and we tried a little bit of everything on the menu and really took in the atmosphere. Before I get into the food, let's chat ascetics. This place is beautifully designed and with the open kitchen and radical bar set up, it's sure to be a busy place for years to come. The highlights for me were the wallpaper accents and vaulted ceiling, just nails. \n\nAs far as the food goes, everything was thoughtfully done and beautifully presented. Default to my photos for this review because I can't remember the names of all the pastas we consumed but, they were elegant and so well done. The chopped salad was super tasty and reminded me of Nancy Silvertons in Los Angeles at Mozza. Boo ya. Lastly, the pizza crust was heavenly.

So...\n\nHooray for foodgasms! And, it can be found here at Che Fico because the hype is real.\n\nChe Fico is the current SF hot spot from a Flour + Water, Eleven Park Madison, and Craftman & Wolves alums so you know it IS going to be good.\n\nAlthough they accept walk-ins, reservations are a must on the weekends. Plan ahead, because it's currently hard to get (I made reservations 3 weeks in advance).\n\nThe Cal-Italian menu is divided up to antipasti, pizzas, housemade pastas, entrees, and peasant comfort food (yas to gizzards and beef tongue!). Prices are fair for SF standards, expect to spend around $60-$70 pp (pre-tip w/ 1 cocktail).\n\nWhile perusing the menu, I ordered the Concord Grape w/ black pepper, cucumber, lime, soda ($8) and asked our server if they can make it with booze (+ $4 grey goose): https://bit.ly/2JP1x8h. It was like sparkling grape juice with a spicy finish but you couldn't taste the alkie. \n\nSince it was our second dinner, we only ordered several items to sample:\n\n*Corned Beef Tongue w/ pickled mustard seeds, salsa verde, crispy capers, shaved celery ($14): https://bit.ly/2EP1C8n\nBeef tongue is so underrated and I always order it at taquerias and Asian eateries. For \"peasant comfort food\", Che Fico's rendition is the most refined take I've seen. It was tender with a nice, acidic bite from the mustard seeds and a nice crispness from the shaved celery. This would be awesome as a cold cut in a sandwich. \n \n*Caciocavallo: Fried cheese, wsr meyer lemon preserves, espelette, josey baker molasses rye ($12): https://bit.ly/2HqNKX2\nHello, cheesey wet dreams! The thick layer of caciocavallo was crisp and nutty around the edges and deliciously melty in the center. However, someone was heavy handed with the lemon preserves so it was overwhelming tart and perfume-y.\n\n*Goats Milk Ricotta Gnudi w/ ramps, spring garlic, leeks ($21): https://bit.ly/2qwrHoj\nThe gnocchi-like ricotta dumplings were pillowy soft and the fried shoestring leeks provided a fantastic textural contrast. It reminded me of a dish I had at Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in PA that I loved but I like this a touch more because of the fried leeks. \n\n*Pineapple Pizza w/ fermented chili, red onion ($20): https://bit.ly/2qB8BfT\nOK, I know what you're thinking: pineapple on a pizza? WTF, it's a cardinal sin but you MUST try this one! The hype is real...\n\nThe charred leopard spotted crust is bubbly and aerated, and the bottom crust STAYS crisp unlike neapolitan pizza. And, whoever thought to shave parmigiano on the crust? F*ckin' genius! It elevates it to a whole new level. The paper thin slices of pineapple along with the fermented chili and melty cheese produced a mouthwatering salty-sweet-spicy combo that makes me salivate when I think about it. Yea, it's not traditional but it's the most delicious and unique pizza in SF! GET IT! \n\n*Olive Oil Cake w/ malted yogurt gelato, roasted strawberry vinaigrette ($12) & Fior de latte & Salted caramel gelato ($8): https://bit.ly/2qzyOeE\nA perfect ending to a great meal, the house-made gelatos were excellent. The fior de latte's milky creaminess was our favorite, then the salted caramel, and malted yogurt. The olive oil cake was good too but the gelatos took that cake!\n\nAs for service, I read mixed reviews with some saying, it's terrible and rude. Depending on who you may encounter, it's true...\n\nWe arrived early for our reservations and took a chance by asking if we could be seated early. The hostesses said, our table wouldn't be ready until our reservation time. No problem, we'll grab a drink at the bar. There was no room in the bar but there were seats in the waiting area several feet away (nowhere near the entrance which is downstairs). I told the hostess that we were going to grab drinks and wait in the waiting area. \"Umm, you'll probably get kicked out\", she said. WTF?! We left and went across the street to Mini Bar for drinks. \n\nThankfully, once we returned and were seated, Aimee, our server was fantastic. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made great recommendations. Food service was prompt and properly coursed out. \n\nThe owners and designers of Che Fico have done an excellent job transforming the former autobody shop. It's rustic, yet hip with the beautiful floor tiles and fig wallpaper motif and an open kitchen. Bad acoustics though as it's loud AF but they play awesome 90s hip hop - 112, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G, and TLC. Heeeeeyyyy! \n\nChe Fico has completely ruined pizza for me.

Cohesive decor, top quality fixtures and finishes, great view into the kitchen, great views of the neighborhood, great music, little details like amazing fresh flower arrangements.\n\nThe service is impeccable. All levels - check-in, servers, waiters, managers, etc etc etc. Everyone is friendly - it feels like they have tons of time for you even in the middle of a very busy restaurant. A huge treat to sit at the chef's counter and watch up close at the skill that goes into cooking and preparing each dish; plus being able to ask questions about technique and ingredients.\n\nThe food - dang. Try it all! There is always something new. It's awesome to see them continually exploring and changing. I now have absolute favorites I have a hard time not getting, but also every time see new things that are must try. Have not been disappointed with anything.\n\nThe chopped salad - what. Who recommends a chopped salad? This is like the most perfect version of a chopped salad I've ever had. \n\nThe pasta - its own call out because it's so dang good. Try a few.\n\nPizza - another dang good.\n\nEverything else - the appetizers, sides, eastern-European Jewish mini menu - all so good. I love that they have several non-alcoholic drinks - the Concord cocktail is absolutely amazing; they could expand the selection even further and I would try them all.\n\nDESSERT!!!! O M G - all impeccable; I want them all every time I go. Their ice cream might secretly be the absolute best in the city (certainly able to hold its own alongside Bi-Rite and Humphry Slocombe).\n\nWhoa - ok - effusive review much? You bet. This isn't just a neighborhood gem (it is) but it is also now hands down one of the best restaurants in the city.\n\nGet on the reservation list and/or just pop in and try your luck. Then go back again and again and again.", "author": "Ryan B."}

Service was impeccable, everyone was super knowledgeable and friendly.  Our waitress Whitney was lovely and spot on with her recommendations.  We started with the melon and lonza, house cured anchovies and squash blossoms.  The anchovies were awesome!!  So yummy and amazing flavors.  The sauce on the squash blossoms was wonderful.  Highly recommend both of those.  We then tried the suppli which is basically an arancini.  Good but nothing special.  The ragu was really good, pasta was cooked perfectly and sauce was really tender and wonderful.  The mushroom and sausage pizza was also great, crust was perfectly doughy and crisp.  The crostata was also amazing.  \n\nCan't wait to go back and try more things.", "author": "Erin D."}

I believe the large communal table in the center is set aside for walk-ins, and the waiter told us that a line does start forming before their 5:30 open so keep that in mind. There is a bar area where you can hang out as you wait. \n\nWe started with the suppl\u00ed (fried rice balls) which were pretty good. Cocktails were good and pretty strong. Broccoli di ciccio (broccolini?) came with some edible flowers and were charred with some lemon and mustard flavors. It was pretty good but I am sensitive to mustardy flavors so my nose cleared up pretty violently a couple times, heh.\n\nWe got the pineapple and fermented chili pizza (seems like the popular choice when we did our research) - which was spicier than we thought. I dug it but it was a tad spicy for my friend. Otherwise it was a really good pizza with amazing crust. Will have to try some of their other pizzas. The biggoli nero (squid ink pasta?) was interesting. It was super oily but I guess by design? The pasta basically sits in a large pool of olive oil - I found it too oily tho. Flavors were different. Not bad, but I kinda got sick of it after awhile, maybe it was too strong of a flavor? There were some Dungeness crab and clam pieces scattered throughout the pasta, not a tonnnn but the dish overall was a bit small.\n\nWe ended with a bittersweet chocolate budino which came with a scoop of gelato. The chocolate was amazinggggg .. but there was a pretty substantial dollop of olive oil poured on top which was weird for me. Not sure how I feel about olive oil on my dessert.\n\nOverall food was decent but a little under my expectations. Thhe pizza definitely shines here.", "author": "Grace D."}

The hostess said it would be about a hour and a half wait but that the bar was first come, first serve. \n\nTip: they take down your number and will text you so if the wait ends up being long - you can head to the bars down the street. \n\nWe ended up waiting about 15 mins and grabbed a seat at the bar. We ordered the rice balls, a pasta dish and a pizza. The pizza and pasta arrived at the same time as we later found out there was a kitchen error with the rice balls. The pizza and pasta dish were delicious. The pizzas have 4 slices and the pasta dish is kinda small but flavorful. As I mentioned earlier there was a delay with the rice balls which was no biggie - understanding it was their grand opening. The bar staff were apologetic about it. Hey! I get it. They arrived and I wish I had them first. I think because we waited, we were underwhelmed. Though the shell of the rice ball was pretty crispy. \n\nOrdered the fruit tart dessert and it was delicious. The food is good and the atmosphere is fun.

From the moment you are in the dining room, one can notice the immense open space. Although only 2 floors up, you feel like the city is beneath you. To the left you can see the open kitchen at work, quite an exciting view actually. \n\nService was great here. The employees seemed passionate and excited to be working here (Disclaimer: This is very early to the opening of the restaurant). What is even more impressive is that the place was completely packed at 10PM (when we dined) yet service did not seem slow at all.\nFor a drink, I got the Milk Punch. I'm not a big drinker, but this was pretty tasty, my friend told me it tasted similar to a whiskey sour.\n\nThe first food ordered were the rice balls/suppl\u00ed. These were divine. They didn't taste greasy/oily, yet they were full of flavor. They had a great crunch to them as well. I really recommend it.\n\nFor a second appetizer, I got the duck liver. Presentation wise, it was beautiful. I was a bit scared when I saw the abundance of onions; but the flavor actually impressed me and I was asking myself for even more. These were served with a side of crackers. The duck liver was also really good in this dish; I was worried the dressing would hide the flavor; but it complimented it very well.\n\nMy entree was the tagliatelle al ragu, which has very good color to it. Sometimes I worry about meat in pasta dishes because the flavor is hidden - but here you will definitely taste the fine tasting meat.\n\nTo finish the dinner, we had a dessert of olive oil cake. No, you won't taste the olive oil, but there is a very strong abundance of sweet; maybe almost too sweet for some? As someone with a sweet tooth, I thoroughly enjoyed how simple and tasteful this dish was.\n\nI can't wait to come back to try more.", "author": "Vinh T."}

I don't care how nasty your food is, if you have figs on you're wall, I'll like it. Kidding, but DIZZAM what great taste.\n\nNow, on to less important things, the food ;)\n\n* Caciocavalo- we got this to start, and it was tasty. The meyer lemon gave the dish so much flavor. Also, anything labeled with \"WSR\" on the menu comes from their ranch not too far from here..kinda cool!\n\n* Cavatelli- this was my least favorite dish. The pasta itself was good, but the vegetables in it were overcooked and kind of bleh. Wish they were more crispy! Wouldn't get again.\n\n* Pineapple, red onion, and fermented chili, can I get a HALLELUJAH for the pineapple?! All you pineapple pizza haters keep hating, because that means there's more for me. But seriously, I am so happy there is finally a restaurant that appreciates the most valuable topping on pizza. Also, the fermented chili makes for the perfect amount of spice every bite you take (if you can't handle a little spice, this probably isn't for you). Now can we talk about the crust?! Arguably the best part. The crust was perfectly crisp, and the thinly shredded parmesan melted in your mouth with every bite. I will be getting this every time I come back.\n\nIt was super busy for their grand opening, and I'd expect it to stay that way for some time, but we got there at 5:30 and walked right up to the full service bar.

(We made a reservation many weeks ahead) \n\nI then awkwardly looked around for where I should wait. My options consisted of a narrow hallway that everyone from the waitstaff, the cook with an entire cart of pasta, about 20 people waiting for their reservation and the hostess running coat check out of a cleaning closet were occupying.\n\nWhen we were seated, the decor was charming but the restaurant was LOUD. \n\nWhen the waiter came back to get our drink orders, he told us he couldn't hear us. We joked that the music was a little loud. He said, \"Yes. It is very loud. Makes it difficult for conversations in here. But, it makes it a fun environment to work in.\" We proceeded to yell our orders at him about 3 times so he could hear them.\n\nWine:\nWhen the wine arrived, the waiter placed the drinks down without saying what they were and walked away. In doing so, he had switched our orders around. Since my friend had ordered the ros\u00e9 and I had the white, it was clearly easy to figure out. We switched back and took a sip. Upon trying it, the ros\u00e9 tasted wrong. When he came back we asked what the wines were to make sure. He acted as if we had just asked him to recite the Germanic alphabet backwards.\n\nFood:\nHaving made Bon App\u00e9tit Top 10 best new restaurants in the US list, we had very high expectations for our meals. We also initially attributed the obnoxious environment to the chef's alleged ability to wow us enough to not care. This was not the case. Our appetizers were quite delicious, but each of the entrees we ordered were extremely underwhelming. By no means bad, but definitely not superb. Especially not for the hefty price. Also pay no attention to their portion recommendations. \"Serves 2\" really means \"Serves 1.\" \"Serves 4\" really means \"Serves 1.5\". So, that $55 piece of pork that was supposed to serve 4, is now the most expensive appetizer you've ever ordered.\n\nOverall: \nThis place is Che F***ING loud and a bit overpriced for what it raves to be. I guess this has become the new standard for San Francisco dining. *Sigh* (which nobody heard because it was so loud.)", "author": "Hannah L."}

I'm sure if we had selected maybe a few other things it could of upped the delish factor, yet what we got it was always lingering in the back of my mind, really??\n\nThe risotto cake - not hot on the inside. Nice flavor but ours was served lukewarm.\n\nChopped salad - too much dressing.  Smoked provolone too big of chunks that did not balance the thinly sliced salami.  My tastebuds would of liked some grilled radicchio thrown in to offset the too much dressing and add a deeper layer to an overall good salad.\n\nSquash pasta - not sure what was on top since my husband ordered it and I didn't even read about it.  I'm thinking chestnuts but no.  Did not work.  The pasta was a tiny bit al dente to my taste (same thing so many places do and IMO no cook the pasta just a tiny tiny bit more so there is not a feeling of dent when you bit) yet the contrast of these things on top that were hard and a texture that made you think, what? yet you ate it since the buttery cheese flavor kept you going on.  IMO I would of put a salty olive oil broccolini or other wilted green on top so that you could take a bite of that with the chestnut (?) to match those flavors because IMO it did not go with the ravioli since it felt in the mouth and on the tastebuds like two distinctly different items.\n\nFried chicken - Wrong.  There was nothing \"fried\" about this.  It was like something you would get in an Asian restaurant with the diced vegetables on top, and it most definitely was baked with moist and greasy and yummy skin but not fried.   Not what I expected and had we known how this was prepared and would taste we would of most definitely gotten another item on the menu.\n\nWill we come back.  Probably due to the atmosphere, energy, location and waitstaff.\n\nIMO it is hard to produce stellar products at that pace in that large of a space so I hope they continue to succeed and improve.\n\nWe'll come back to try the pizza and dessert.

Char and smoke are wonderful flavors. Unfortunately, the pie I had, as well as others coming out of the oven, were past the point of char. \nThe pizzas are burnt. \n\nWhen I think about char, I think about beautiful leoparding of pies like those at L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele, Di Fara, Lucali, Roberta's, and Young Joni. There is no leoparding here. More like black panther. \n\nThe otherwise perfect consistency and flavor of the sourdough crust (and wonderful toppings- I got the pineapple and fermented chili) was overshadowed by bitterness and an acrid aftertaste of the crust. Not a pleasant punctuation. \n\nPerhaps if you are sharing plates, trying several items, and only have one slice, you may not notice the crust, as it is covered in freshly shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. But if you come here to devour pizzas, it may be hard not to commit the cardinal sin of eating the pie but leaving the crust behind on the plate. \n\nSuppl\u00ed was nice. Chopped salad was fresh and authentic. I expected to actually see some pieces of octopus in the Bigoli Nero, but unfortunately did not. The octopus flavor was less prominent than the lemon used in the dish.\n\n5 stars to the pastry chef.

From the moment we arrived, after meeting the very gracious hostess staff, we had the unfortunate experience of dealing with a brusque mustachioed bartender, whom said hostess staff had to apologize for his rude behavior.\n\nWe eventually ordered the Classico at the bar from said mustachioed bartender. One of the hostesses sat us in the corner. Waiting for the cocktail or some form of attention, eventually a half an hour passed by. After flagging down the third person who was supposed to find out what was happening with our drink, I got the first thing that I could review - the Classico is a good, spirit-forward cocktail with some herbal notes. If you come here and like boozy drinks, you should order it. Once the cocktail arrived, I finally had the opportunity to order the very uninspiring food.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the suppli, polenta, eggplant mezzaluna, pappardelle ragu, and the pineapple, red onion, & fermented chili pizza. I would write a detailed review of each of these items but it mostly would be a waste of space. The polenta was the best of the mediocre bunch; the flavors were extremely interesting but the gruel-like texture limited this from becoming anything beyond a \"good\" dish. I wish I could comment on the suppli because it never arrived.\n\nThe pastas were also extraordinarily underwhelming - the mezzaluna was over-citrused but somehow still bland, and for a \"top Italian restaurant\", I couldn't imagine a more uninspired bolognese for the pappardelle. \n\nThe pizza was interesting but not great. The idea of pineapple pizza is heretical to me, but the waitress sold me on it. On the basis of toppings, I was completely wrong; the toppings were fantastic - the pineapple paired with the high-quality tomato sauce, red onion, and fermented chili were an unexpectedly delicious flavor combo, but the purposely hyper-charred crust added nothing, even though I could see how it could potentially work paired with the right toppings. \n\nTo Che's credit, their wine recommendation was on point - the Campania by the glass was fantastic.\n\nSimilar to a first date gone awry set up by a best friend, I would consider giving it another try if I didn't have to go out of my way to do it. However, I wouldn't be incredibly excited to try again despite seeing glimpses of how everything theoretically might be salvageable. At the very least, I would hope my date just had a bad day and wouldn't be as rude the second time around.", "author": "Keith R."}

I made the reservations a month in advance, so the anticipation was very real. We arrived at the restaurant promptly and were greeted by a very long line of folks attempting to dine without reservations. We were able to jump the line since we had a reservation and were greeted by a very wonderful host. The ambiance of the place is very funky and retro. It's a very cool experience to observe little details while enjoying your meal. We ordered a wide spread of appetizers, entrees, sides, and dessert and were not disappointed at all. The food was delicious and very well prepared. The corn with eggplant and the chicken were my absolute favorite!

One of the men working on the salads had extremely poor hygiene. He was wearing a white shirt with a print of red and blue popsicles and the Statue of Liberty on it. We noticed the following behavior of his while sitting there:\n\n-Rubbed his hands though his hair numerous times \n\n-Put a spoon that he used for plating into his mouth and then back into the container with other plating utensils that were in use. \n\n-Picked up small pieces of food and put them in his mouth/touching his mouth and lips with his fingers.  \n\nHe touched food for guests with his fingers after doing all of things - it was appalling to watch - luckily we had had eaten most of our food before noticing these things because it made me feel nauseated watching it all. \n\nWe were also surprised by the overall lack of urgency in the service. We sat there for over 20 minutes before water was poured for us. Our first drinks, which we ordered at the same time as our food, came after the salad. When our third course (pizza) came there were 4 empty dirty plates still sitting in front us that had sat there for a while.  \n\nWhen the server asked us if we wanted dessert we said we would like to see the menu. She brought it but with the final bill clipped on top of  it  - something I have never seen before. given that and the fact what we had seen had really made us lose our appetites we did not order dessert. \n\nOverall we were pretty appalled by the experience. I would like to chalk some of the behavior up to a working out the kinks of a new restaurants but years in the making, 6+ weeks of being open and more than 1 week with no response via email, I could not put off this review any longer.\n\nIf you want to be oblivious to this behavior do not sit at the tall seats by the counter. \n\nThe only redeeming thing about the evening was my Boulevardier cocktail but since I was not at the bar at the time it was made I don't know if I would feel the same about it.", "author": "E E."}

Unfortunately, don't always believe the hype. Don't get me wrong. They did an amazing job with the space. The cocktails were on point and the food was for the most part flavorful and well presented. But there were parts of our meal that I just didn't feel lived up to the buzz about this place and didn't feel worth the money. The service was adequate but not friendly. It was almost as if the waiter took himself too seriously to actually be helpful. He didn't really give guidance about the menu or how many plates would be enough to share. Instead he upsold us on a focaccia appetizer which was very good but unnecessary. I would have appreciated him letting my party know that perhaps the pasta AND the pizza would be overkill with the focaccia. Speaking of the pasta--ordered the carbonara and it was gummy. Octopus salad was flavorful but a bit chewy. We also ordered the summer salad with gazpacho. For a place that is shared plates, the gazpacho came in one large bowl and was awkward to share. Though this was by far my favorite dish, I think I would have enjoyed it more if they served it in little individual bowls or at least gave us bowls as an option. Porchetta was good but not special. Olive oil cake seemed dry though the elderberry gelato was a winner.  \n\nAlso the noise in the restaurant was off the hook. I couldn't hear my friend sitting next to me. But due to odd acoustics and placement, I could very clearly hear people standing by the bar partition which was right next to our booth. I felt like I wanted to tell the woman chatting with her friends that the dude wasn't worth her time! Overall it was an okay experience. I expected so much more given the hype and given the competition for quality food and dining experiences in the City.", "author": "Elizabeth H."}

Design appointments and usage of the space speak to a confident and knowledgeable team. High ceilings and gracious table spacing are a strength of the room, music uniforms and menu all speak to the convivial experience your about to enjoy.\nBeverage program is a great size, approximately 50 bottle approach-ably priced wine list of primarily Cali and Italian labels with some unique varietals. Great selections of quality spirits behind the bar and knowledgeable team members. \nMenu is engineered for sharing and great for small groups or dates. Offering are uniformly delicious, high level of execution and consistency. \nHighlights were the tuna conserva, Caciocavallo (fried cheese), Chopped Duck liver- this was an elegant presentation and delightful flavor profile really speaking to the culinary teams prowess. \nWe tried all six of the handmade pastas and my personal favorite was the land and green garlic agnolotti with peas and artichokes but they were all worthy of the spend, delicate and sauced just right. \nTo full for any of the main courses these will need to be addressed next trip. Try the broccolini, anchovy, Mustard and citrus, super tasty and texturally perfect. \nDesserts were tasty but stylistically reaching in a direction not quite inline with the savory offerings, but again my affinity for Italian desserts makes me a bit biased.

Went with a friend with no reservations and only waited about 25min on a Friday evening. Although we did go a little earlier (6ish) than primetime so maybe that's why. \n\nUpon entering upstairs you'll notice the awesome floor tiles and wallpaper! The whole restaurant is decorated very well and it has a very fun vibe to it. I can't put my finger on it but it reminds me of NY restaurants and the vibe it gives off. My friend mentioned that and completely agree!  I really HOPE SF catches on to this style, we need more of that! Side note: the bathrooms are decorated just as well! \n\nSo you can put your name down with the host/hostess or head to the bar and put your name down for a seat there. We opted for the bar and it was a short wait. The bartender was great at recommending drinks and we opted to go off menu and have him create his own based on what we liked! He adapted well and created some nice refreshing cocktails! \n\nNot going to get to the details of the food but will say that everything we had was delicious and down very very well. The appetizers, pineapple pizza and pasta were bomb!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-26", "description": "I think mehhhh sums this review up pretty well. Overall, the food was fine but for the price point, I've had better, and service they're definitely working out some kinks. To start, we arrived for 5:30 pm reservation, seated immediately greeted by waiter pretty shortly after, drink orders were taken... and then we waited about 15 minutes for our drinks. The first set of diners cannot wait that long for drinks (no one is ahead of us?).   We all ordered The Dill and honestly, none of us enjoyed it. I think a lot of bars in the city do a great mezcal cocktail and this had to pungent of alcohol flavor and nothing else going on. For food, we had the following:\n\n- Small chop salad: 4/5, needed something green, the small portion actually worked well for the 4 of us and it was tasty \n- Anchovies: 3/5, sauce the anchovies were in was tasty, but I'm not even sure we all even got an anchovy to taste \n- Zucchini blossoms: 3/5, stuffed with ricotta, lightly fried in a tomato sauce. Hit the spot, but didn't really wow me \n- Artichoke hearts: 5/5, lightly fried, the outside leaves were like chips while the insides were tender and juicy. Delicious and there were 4 so it split well. \n- Pineapple pizza: 3/5, The pizza itself is a 2/5 but the crust OMG 5/5. The pizza is verryyy thin to the point it's just flopping around and I thought it was overly salty. The crust though is puffed up beautifully and sprinked with a small amount of shredded cheese. I'd try a pizza of some sort. \n- Ragu: 3/5, Very light, actually not your typical ragu with a heavy sauce. Think noodles cooked well, but again it was good but nothing special we thought. \n- Donut sandwich for dessert: 2/5, Wanted to like this wayyyy more but the donut was almost tasteless but the gelato inside was yummy. \n\nOur waiter was a nice guy, but he took a while to come back to us and overall we thought the service needed work, but this is probably some growing pains. Probably wouldn't come back and honestly I think their are plenty of other places in the city at a better price point.", "author": "Aryn C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-12", "description": "Underwhelmed. Given the hype, I was expecting this place to be comparable to Lilia in Brooklyn or Felix in LA... SPOILER ALERT: It's not. Is it good? Yeah, it's good. It's fine. But it's definitely not great.\n\nFour of us ordered a few appetizers, three pastas, and a pizza. Our favorite thing was the chopped salad, which I think says more about the rest of the food than it says about the salad. The salad was basically a vehicle for chopped cured meats and cheese, so OF COURSE it was delicious. \n\nThe pastas were all freshly made, so of course they tasted like good fresh pasta, but you know what else is good? The fresh pasta you can buy at Lucca and make at home or even the fresh pasta you can get at Whole Foods! I was really hoping that this place could be my Lilia of SF as Lilia also doesn't try to reinvent the wheel and makes amazing fresh, simple pasta, but this was just so blah. The octopus pasta was overly fishy, and speaking as someone who usually loves anything octopus-related, the texture of the chopped up octopus in the sauce was really awful. The pappardelle was good, but I prefer the papparadelle/tagliatelle that's a mainstay on Nopa's menu down the road. The squash ravioli was also just fine. Portions were incredibly small, which is strange considering they encourage doing dinner family style. Our server even recommended getting half orders in order to be able to try more... If we'd done that, we would have gotten a noodle each in some cases, so I'm glad we went with full orders.\n\nThe pizza was good. I was into the charred crust, but again I didn't understand the hype around the pineapple pizza. It tasted like a pineapple pizza, which, yes, I do like, but I don't know the last time Anderson Cooper or Gwyneth tweeted about the Hawaiian pizza at Round Table (which, yes, I like as well) the way they did about this one.\n\nTo top it off, service was subpar. This felt like our waitress's first restaurant job, and usually at restaurants of this alleged caliber, you get the awesome career servers who have already worked at all of the best restaurants in the city. Her food recommendations were long-winded and meandering (JUST TELL US WHAT TO EAT), and her wine recommendations ended up being far from what we had asked for. She also walked past our table multiple times while we had empty cocktail glasses, and I had to literally wave to her to finally get her to come over so that we could spend more money. \n\nAnd is the space cool? Yes, it's cool. But it's loud. I'm usually fine with loud places, but our server couldn't even hear what we were saying when we were already raising our voices. She had to lean over our table in order to hear us. Really awkward, and I don't know why they keep the music so loud. This isn't SoulCycle, people.\n\nIf this were a place where you could just walk in and grab a drink and a bowl of pasta, I'd definitely go back, but for the effort it takes to go there, it's not worth it.", "author": "Jenny M."}

The dining space is broken up by a haphazardly placed room dedicated to aging charcuterie that seems like an afterthought, while an L-shaped bar caps the end nearest the door.\n\nThe restaurant scene in San Francisco is all about the buzz. And right now Che Fico (BTW, \"Che Fico\" means \"Oh that's cool\" in colloquial Italian. How precious!) has the buzz. Reservations less than two months away are hard to come by, and don't even think of \"just showing up\" or your wait will be interminable. \n\nThe menu at Che Fico centers on rustic Italian fare influenced by California sensibilities and includes pastas, pizzas, secondi (second courses for two or four) and dolci (dessert). \n\nThe pastas are marked fatto a mano (handmade), fatto a macchina en casa (machine-made in-house), or secco (dried), and range from tagliatelle al ragu Bolognese ($24), a rather greasy ensemble that didn't include any tomatoes, to bigoli nero with only microscopic bits of Dungeness crab ($28). \n\nA selection of \"Cucina Ebraica\" includes small plates that are reflective of the Jewish-Italian tradition, like beef tongue with crispy capers ($14, a dish that licks you back) and grilled chopped duck liver ($14).\n\nThe stars of the show are the wood-fired pizzas with an \"intentionally blackened\" sourdough crust that is toothsome and light. Neither too crispy, nor too chewy, the foundation of the pizzas is delicious: this pizzaiolo knows his stuff. With exactly four pieces of sausage, the mushroom, sausage, mozzarella and Calabrian chili version ($22) disappeared all too quickly. However, give the pineapple, red onion and fermented chili one ($20) a miss as the pineapple makes the crust too soggy. \n\nWith all the hoopla around Che Fico, expect to wait beyond your appointed reservation time. The dining room is noisy, but not over the top. Service was polite, if slow. While according to the server, \"The kitchen paces the dishes,\" the kitchen needs to pick up its pace: time from order to delivery for a quick-to-fire selection of pasta, pizza and contorni (side dishes) was over 30 minutes.\n\nThe wine list is OK, but bartenders measure pours with an eye dropper. With all the craft beers available in San Francisco, surely Che Fico could find more than just one, the delicious Fort Point KSA.\n\nAll in all, this time Che Fico was good, not great.

Waitstaff and menu were inviting and cheery, and everyone looked happy to be there.\n\nWe ordered the pepperoni pizza, chopped liver, arancini, and anchovy salad.\n\nPizza: good size, but the crust was burnt and the sauce/cheese situation was fine, not too flavorful, and not better than the other options on Divisadero.\n\nLiver: gorgeous looking (truly) but just not tasty. I really love liver and p\u00e2t\u00e9 but I surprisingly did not like this. Texture and flavor were off and it was under seasoned.\n\nAnchovy salad: meh. Greens should have been dressed better and the cheese olive oil centerpiece needed salt. The ingredients didn't taste mind blowing which is what great Italian food is all about.\n\nThe arancini was fine - also under salted and too large which led to much mushiness compared to external crispness. I think they should do two per order, just smaller sized.\n\nOur server noticed that we did not finish the liver and she kindly removed it from the bill, which saved us $22. This also makes me feel bad for writing this review. But unfortunately the truth wins and my son has forced me to wield it with honor.\n\nWe were sad that the food wasn't better and I will definitely be checking out the pasta next time hoping Che Fico redeems hypey itself. \n\nUntil then, I'm still rooting for ya!

We had a 7.45pm reservation on a weekend night and arrived 30 minutes early for a drink at the bar. At most places, this would be a nice start to the evening, but not at Che Fico. The bar is for reservations only, so we stood while having a glass of wine. This would have been ok, except that by 8.15 our table was still not ready, and we had been standing for an hour. It was not possible to order an appetizer as there was no place to put it. There were at least 8 empty seats at the bar, but in spite of our 7.45pm reservation, we were repeatedly told that those seats were being held for 8.15pm bar reservations - does this make any sense ?! \n\nWhen we were finally seated at 8.15, we were told the restaurant was out of the pasta bolognese - at 8.15 on a Saturday night.

The sauce on the carbonara was more like an adult version of boxed macaroni and cheese. Fortunately the flavor of the ragu sauce was better. But again because the pasta was undercooked, both pasta dishes overall were disappointing.\n\nThe Coriander cocktail tasted watered-down despite our server advising us that it was more spirit forward.  \n\nSeems like pasta and cocktails would be solid since they're showcased on the menu.

The cocktails were great and the starter, the Caciocavallo, was wonderful and had so many different ingredients that went together perfectly. \nI was with 3 others and we ordered 2 pizzas and 2 half-pasta orders. The pizza was good, not blown away. The pasta was great but we only got 2 bites each. I would suggest splitting a pizza or 2 and everyone getting their own pasta. \n\nThe service was bad. We were brought the wrong pizza and instead of apologizing or comping the pizza they said \"oh\" and walked away. We then had to wait for an entire new pizza made. We wanted to order something else since we were all still hungry and had to wait over 10 minutes before someone made eye contact and we asked them to bring our waiter over. The waiter switched with another waiter mid-shift without mentioning to us. We had to flag down someone for a drink re-order. It seemed like there was plenty of staff there and they were all mingling with eachother. \n\nIf the wait for a reservation weren't so long I would try to go again and order better depending on the group size.

The line I could live with, only because I was staying a couple of blocks away and it was no big deal to line up before opening (5:30), put my name on the list, go home, and get texted to come back hours later. Chatting with people in line was sadly the most pleasurable part of this dining experience. If your idea of a good time is waiting for hours, sitting under bright lights at a communal table rubbing elbows with strangers and SCREAMING across the table  to your companion, eating pretty good food, paying too much for it, and leaving with a migraine, then this is the place for you! \n\nCocktails, very good. Salad, nothing to write home about. Pasta- tried two: ragu very good, carbonara was a large tube pasta that was so undercooked that it sucked up every bit of the sauce and left a dried yellow finish on the noodles, extremely disappointing. (Btw, both pastas were portioned for ONE.) I don't even remember what else we ordered, except for the sorbetto, which was delicious. The service was ok, but waiter literally could not hear. The space itself was lovely in a rustic way. The communal table is long and wide. There is suspended lighting over it every few feet. If you are unlucky enough to be sitting directly under one of the fixtures, you could perform surgery. (The couple next to us, young enough to be more tolerant of noise, one would assume) asked to be moved to the bar or anywhere else. \n\nMaybe you have a small corner table (reserve months in advance), go very late when it's not at maximum capacity, order the right thing, have a HIGH tolerance for noise, and place a high value on bragging rights for eating at the place of the moment, you will see value in dining at Che Fico.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-25", "description": "With all of the extraordinarily positive buzz and reviews, we couldn't wait to go to Che Fico.  We snagged a prime time reservation a month ahead of time and quite literally counted the days until we could go.  You enter at street level and walk up a set of stairs to the host stand.  I'll start with the good news.  Once you enter the restaurant, the \"reveal\" is a massive, gorgeous space that is stuffed with bustling people.  It has a fantastic \"vibe,\" and you feel really cool being a part of it.  We could not have been more pleased as we sat down at our table.  The \"Indian Summer Insulate\" (Tomatero Farm early girl tomatoes, sweet peppers, beets, hazelnut, Rogue Creamery smokey blue) was simply out of this world.  A perfect combination of flavors and textures, and the tomatoes felt like they had been picked just hours before.  The blue cheese was a perfect foil to the tomatoes, and the hazelnut added wonderful texture.  This was an A+++++++++.  The bread and olive oil were fantastic.  Now the bad news.  The gorgeous space with concrete floors and walls is so loud that holding a conversation, even just 2 people at a very small table, is pretty much impossible.  The \"Suppli\" (fried risotto, tomato, fontina) were cold, dry, and without much flavor.  I can't remember having had such unremarkable arancini.  After the salad, we waited 50 minutes for the \"San Francisco Margherita Doc\" pizza to arrive.  I know that it was 50 minutes because I was very hungry and watching the clock.  50 minutes between courses is not ok.  The pizzas at Che Fico are very different from what you get elsewhere.  They are about 75% crust with the filling in the middle.  The crust is big and bold and dry (and kinda burnt  --  but not burnt in a \"good-kind-of-charred-napoletana-way\"  --  I'm talking simply burnt, in the oven too long).  The pizza was so utterly salty that we couldn't eat it.  And this is from two foodies who LOVE salt.  It was inexplicably over-the-top salty.  Then we had the \"Spaghetti Arrabbiata\" (pomodoro, chili, parmigiana region).  We love \"al dente\" pasta, but this was undercooked to the point of being, once again, inedible.  To their credit, when they saw that we weren't eating anything, they asked for feedback, and we gave it to them.  Again to their credit, they took the pizza and spaghetti off the bill.  We left hungry and scratching our heads.  A day later, we are still talking about it and wondering if the chef ever eats what's being served -- because they would certainly realize that they have somehow veered off course.  This place is obviously a massive success already, and good for them.  The fact that they are willing to genuinely listen to input is great.  I hope they can do some fine-tuning in order that their food and service experience can rise to the occasion of all of the massive hype.", "author": "Thomas M."}

They have limited reservations on open table, so I got a reservation about a month out. The only spots I could find online were for 9:30pm or later, and they save a lot of seats for walk ins. \n\nWe got there a little early hoping to get seated early, so we went to the bar area to wait. As we put in our drink order, they had seats for us about 30 min early, which was nice. The restaurant is actually quite large, and they have a private room on the side.\n\nDRINKS:\nCocktails: they have a full bar with craft cocktails. All the cocktails have a focus on a particular ingredient such as strawberries or pepper. The bar area was crowded, but there is a server who comes to you to gets you drink order, which is nice. \n- Strawberry: intense in a really good way. I really liked this, and it was great to start off the dinner\n- Milk punch: interesting, but if you like fruit, the strawberry is better \n\nWines: they have a lot of Italian wines. By the glass... \n- Barbaresco: lighter, a bit acidic, still has some tanins\n- Anglianico from Campania: I really liked this - full bodied, lots of tanins, earthy. \n\nFOOD: \nThey have an interesting menu with Italian food but some Jewish and local California touches. It's also awesome that the chefs have spent time at EMP and also flour + water. \n\nThe menu is actually quite big, but we wanted to focus on carbs.\n\nTo start: salami plate - much smaller than we expected with only 8 pieces for $12. I liked the Toscano one, but it was a surprisingly small amount. \n\nOur server recommended half portions of some pastas since we wanted to order so many, but the portions really aren't that big. We did half portions of 3 of them and full of the other 2 and had no problem finishing them (along with a pizza) between 2 of us.\n\nPastas:\n- Tomato leaf cappalleci: filled with salt cod, shaped like wontons, with braised fennel, super intense tomatoes, and olives . This was the most complex dish in flavors, and we both liked this the best. I'm glad we got a whole portion of this. \n- Garganelle: with pancetta and with pole beans  \n- Bigoli nero with octopus sugo, salsa verde: I wish we had gotten a whole portion. The pasta texture was great, and between the salsa verde and octopus, plus crunch from breadcrumbs, it was a very balanced dish \n- Smoked paprika strascinati with lamb sugo. The pasta was like cavatelli, which I love. It was a hearty sugo , so flavor wise, it was as you would expect - like comfort food. It wasn't too gamey, and I loved the pasta texture.  \n- Paccheri carbonara: rich, more egg yolk focused than Parmesan focused, and with slices of pancetta. It was an interesting take on carbonara, but it was a little too much yolk and chives for me. I did save the yolk to dip my pizza crust...\n\nPizza: sourdough crust. \n- Squash blossoms, bagna cauda, mozzarella: I wish there were more of the topping part because I loved that part. The crust took up a large part of the pizza. If you think of it as crusty bread, then it's great warm. However, it didn't seem to match the other part of the pizza that was very thin with the local / seasonal toppings\n\nService started off a bit slow as they were busy but got better. \n\nI know the pizza is a different style, but pastas were the highlight for me. The tomato leaf cappalleci and bigoli were awesome, but I think all are worth trying, and it's nice to have the option of half portions. \n\nWith a reservation, I would come back to try the meats and get the pastas.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

We had previously eaten here, as we live in the neighborhood, and were impressed enough with the food and thought the kinks in service would have been worked out by now. We requested to sit at a table that comfortably sat 5, they put us on a 4 top with an added chair. No big deal, I let it slide. Service took a while once we were seated and was a bit lacking, but the server was pleasant, albeit aloof and not on top of things, like filling our water and wine glasses. \n\n\nFood is pretty tasty, but the front of house fails to bring out food in timely manner, resulting in luke-warm food and main course entrees coming out 15 minutes apart from each other. They fail to provide top notch service and the front of house manager we spoke to (an overweight bearded man wearing a blue button up shirt with very rosy cheeks and slurred voice) was noticably drunk and didn't know the first thing about customer service. He outright dismissed our feedback and just said \"sorry, have a good night.\" Not professional at all, not to mention we could hear servers bad mouthing patrons at the station that was conveniently located right behind us. I worked at Trader Joe's for 6 years, so I know what a reasonable person expects good service to be, and this was not it. \n\nGo to Nopa if you're on Divis or Rich Table if you're in Hayes Valley, the food is hotter, better, and tastier and the service is so so so much better than this place. If you want tasty sour dough pizza, go to del popolo or pizza hacker. There is a major disconnect between the front of house and the kitchen, not to mention we got the servers hair in our food twice during our meal. Gross. Hair in food for a restaurant like this, or any restaurant for that matter, is unacceptable. \n\nI wish you guys the best, as the food is good.

The salumi plate was OK but unlike most we've had--with a warm meatloaf thing and very little sliced, cured meats. And no explanation of what anything was.\n\nThen the problems began.  Unbeknownst to us, the owner/chefs do things THEIR WAY.  They don't say on the menu, but everything is served family-style, shared-plate style.  No matter what.  That means it is very unlikely that you will be eating anything in any logical order.\n\nAfter a long wait, my pasta, cacio e pepe, arrives.  A small portion but not just cheese and pepper, but drenched with butter.  That is not a part of this dish.  But that was the least of our problems.  When they serve anything, they give you a big spoon and fork for sharing.  But we weren't sharing.  This was my pasta.  I waited for a while assuming more would come.  But no. So I dug in and ate it all before it got cold.\n\nTen minutes later the pizza arrives.  Good but not great.  Copious amounts of raw sliced mushrooms over a spicy sausage melange.  About 10 minutes later my wife's pasta carbonara arrived, and it was skimpy and not very good, with a weird fish taste.\n\nI asked about my son's papparadelle pasta?  \"Coming,\" the snooty waiter replied.  My wife finished her pasta, and then we waited another half hour.  My son's pasta never came.\n\nWe asked for the check and said how disappointed we were.  I asked, \"If my wife and I came in and each ordered just a pasta dish, would we get them at about the same time?\"  No, the manager said.  The chef wants things to be cooked as they come in.  That makes no sense, since I assume all our parties orders went in at the same time.\n\nWorst of all, no amends for their error.  No free dessert, nothing.\n\nAnyway Che Fico is not worth the hype.

We knew we might have to find a back-up plan since the wait would be very long for their communal table or the bar area. The bar has its own waitlist which I think is very smart and seamless. The bartender who greeted us and took down our name was awesome. We ordered two rounds of drinks. He quoted us about 1.5 hours of wait. The bar does turn over quickly because the food is mostly quick to make and eat. We ended up waiting for less than an hour which was a nice surprise. The ambience and decor are excellent. They're a good mix of east and west coast. \n\nThe food was excellent. Every dish has its own uniqueness. I would have given this a five stars review if it wasn't for our bartender/waiter. The bartender we got after sitting down was not the one who greeted us. This dude was grumpy. Didn't really smile or interact with us. As three women out on the town on Saturday night, we were certainly in a playful and fun mood. He totally dampened our mood. Also, my friend really likes her drinks spicy and she asked him to make them so. When we got the bill, one of her drinks had an extra charge on it. He didn't disclose with us this would happen. We don't care about the cost but the fact that he made the same size drink and charged for more without letting us know why is shady. Also, when we first sat down and wanted to order the duck liver, he said \"you can't just order appetizers, you have to order an entree too\". I was very annoyed because we already planned on ordering an entire meal. There is definitely a more tactful way to tell your customers that. \n\nAnyhow, he sucks but Che Fico is awesome!", "author": "T D."}

The dining room is fantastic. Vibe is energetic and the interior is super cool. The bar is also fantastic, with great cocktails and amazing bartenders.\n\nBut on to the food... \n\nSuppli are a staple street food in Rome. The are supposed to be crisp, moist within, and have a molten core of cheese. \n\nAt 5 bucks for 1 piece I'd expect a great rendition of this 1 euro snack. But the cheese in the middle was firm. Sorry guys, a poor execution.\n\nThe anchovy appetizer was tasty, but the actual anchovy content was less than 10% of the plate. Less burratta, less eggplant, more fish please. Or else call it a burratta dish .\n\nCappelacci pasta with bacalao was delicious. But the serving size was unforgivably small.\n\nSalad of tomatoes, watermelon, and feta was the nights winner. The gazpacho on the bottom of the plate was perfect and the whole dish was delicious, balanced, and generously sized.\n\nPizza was nice, but there is so much good pizza in this town I don't think it stood out. \n\nDessert was a big miss. The crostata with fig and blackberry was dry and resembled a poor home cook's rendition. I've had better examples of this dessert a thousand times. Why did our server recommend it so highly?\n\nThe rice pudding wasn't really a rice pudding, but rather a pudding with some crispy rice. The dominant flavor was raspberries and it was tasty, just not what the menu description evoked.\n\nSo overall it wasn't a bad meal, just not the experience I'd anticipated given the incredible reviews and the serious prices.", "author": "Al M."}

Thank you.\n- When you place your order they let you know entr\u00e9es won't come at the same time. Ask why and they'll tell you \"because it comes out as soon as it's ready\". Well, isn't it part of a chef's job to plan for this? If you know that pasta will take 10min to make and a pizza 20min, start making pasta 10min in. Our entr\u00e9es did come out one at a time (pasta first and pizza 10min later -- no need to say that we had cold pasta for dinner that night).\n\nWe didn't have a reservation so we waited by the bar (our cocktails were just ok) and sat at the communal table which was fine but very cosy (if they could fit a couple extra chairs in there I'm sure they would), you sit very very close from your neighbors (like elbow to elbow close -- so don't move too much) and in the end you can hear their entire conversation but the one you're having with your friend sitting across from you. This place is super super loud (don't even ask for recommendations if the waiter/waitress is standing on the opposite side of the table, who won't hear a word).\n\nWe ordered 2 things from the menu:\n- Green Garlic Agnolotti Pasta: they tasted fine but for $26 the portion was tiny, so all I remember is having overpriced pasta that tasted good but nothing mind blowing (and had them cold because of their terrible kitchen planning I described earlier).\n- Mushroom, Sausage, Mozzarella, Calabrian Chili Pizza ($22): they put grated parmesan on the crust, that sounds like a nice touch and a good idea at first... until you figure out it must be to hide the burnt crust (looking at other peoples pizza they looked burnt too so it wasn't just ours).

We shared everything we got.\n\nShe had the Thyme cocktail w/ cocchi rosa, aquavite, thyme, oloroso, and genever. She's says that it wasn't quite sweet, very savory. A full-bodied drink with a slightly bitter aftertaste that blends very well.\n\nI had the Berries cocktail w/ mint, smoked maple, ver jus rouge, chocolate bitters, gran classico, and gin. This was a wonderfully light and refreshing drink, perfectly balanced to not be too sweet.\n\n- Grilled chopped duck liver w/ onion marmallatta, scarlet turnips, pickled onions, and Roman matzo; this was rich and creamy, with a perfect blend of salty-sour to balance it out. Essential.\n\n- Wood fired octopus and crispy skin pork belly w/ marbled potatoes, wild watercress, lemon, and chili flake; the potatoes weren't completely softened and served as good complement to the balance of chewy octopus and crispy-tender pork belly. The pork belly was a baffling mix of being crispy and chewy while still being tender and melty.\n\n- Rossotti ranch veal tartare w/ Australian black truffle, lemon, and grilled sourdough bread; oddly the flavor profile of this reminded me a bit of ceviche. The lemon and raw meat were good, though unseasoned. This one was about the flavor of the ingredients.\n\n- Warm beef tongue w/ salsa verde, crispy capers, celery, and pickled mustard seeds; this was fantastic and one of our favorite parts of the meal. I used to have beef tongue in stew when I was a child, and she had never had tongue before. It was slightly crispy on the bottom and the fat was perfectly melty, making a perfect addition to the savory chewiness of the rest of the tongue. The pickled seasonings were perfect, making for a version of tongue that I'd never even considered. Absolutely incredible.\n\n- Triangoli w/ sheep's milk ricotta, lemon, avocado blossom honey, mint, walnuts; a deceptively simple dish, the way the flavors of this dish play off of each other is sublime. Get as many bites as you can with a bit of everything, including the walnuts and the mint. The lemon sauce and subtle sweet tinge of the light honey is a surprisingly fitting pairing for the rich and salty ricotta, but mix in the nutty body of the walnuts and the fresh bite of the mint and you have a brilliant combination of notes in each bite. \n\n- San Francisco margherita DOC pizza; DOC means locally sourced within a couple of miles, and you can taste the freshness. Unfortunately, while still delicious, this was one of the less impressive dishes. For some reason Che Fico chars the crusts of their pizzas, and after the rest of the dishes it felt underwhelming to have just a few bites of margherita pizza. You can taste the quality of the ingredients, but this just didn't pop as much as the rest.\n\n- Slow toasted 21 day dry aged lamb loin w/ wood roasted potatoes, watercress salad, lamb drippings; this was, simply put, perfectly cooked lamb. If you like a good slice of meat, this is an excellent choice and well worth the cost. By this point the meal had defeated us, so we had to box most of it to go, but definitely excellent meat prepared excellently.\n\nThen came dessert. Oh my.\nI had a cup of their coffee. Even their coffee was excellent. I was almost upset at how good even their coffee was. Can these people do no wrong?\n\nShe had the mini cannolis, made with house made ricotta, candied kumquat, and cocoa nibs. These bite-sized delights had cream filling that was rich without being too heavy, and their candied shells was crispy and cracked apart in a very pleasing way. The candied kumquat and cocoa nibs played into the flavor so well that I would even call it clever. She was very pleased.\n\nMy dessert was the triple delight blueberry pavlova w/ crisp coffee meringue, crema, blueberry sorbetto, logan berries, and mint. I disappeared into this. The different flavors and textures of this dish were incredible. The sorbet and the berry sauce and the berries themselves are different textures and styles of that lovely berry sweetness and tangibles, while the crema and coffee meringue gave it a smooth, creamy, rich body. As a fan of all of these things, I was in heaven. I can't complement this dish enough. Mind-blowing.\n\nThe service was prompt and the waiters were wonderful. They were attentive without being overbearing and had a fantastic attitude.\n\nI was prepared to spend far more than I did; after tax, all of this came out to around $250. Absolutely worth the price.

At first taste the sauce seemed a bit too astringent but as I tasted more its depth of flavor shown through.  Great stuff.\n\nA half chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce and a side of polenta. The bird wasn't one of those tiny things so often placed before you. It was large, meaty, and undercooked.  So while the breast was moist, the skin was not at all crisped and as one cut closer to the bone of the thigh or leg the pink became obvious. The undercooking wasn't egregious but sufficient for me to leave parts of the meat alone.  The polenta was perfect.\n\nOne of the chefs asked my opinion of the chicken and I let him know that to me it was undercooked.  He looked and walked over to the expediter, said a few words and returned to his tasks.  Nothing was said to me but my assumption is that the message was received.\n\nOne other thing about the chicken.  It is obviously made to be shared but it was cut in such a way as to make this difficult.

I made a reservation about a month and a half ago for a Thursday night and then was SO upset when a conflict arose that prevented me and my husband from coming. We called to see if there was any chance they could squeeze us in at another time. The hostess was amazing and found a spot to squeeze us in at 530. First of all, the interior is stunning. There are so many intricate details that I loved. Our waitress recommended an amazing Cabernet-esqe wine, and we ordered (let's be honest, I had preordered in my head) the suppli, octopus & pork belly, pepperoni pizza, and half orders of the tagliatelle and orecchiette pastas. \n\nEverything was great, but OMG that pizza. It was incredible. Both pastas featured homemade noodles and were fantastic. The tagliatelle with ragu was much lighter than some others I've had, but not in a bad way! When we come back, we agreed we would pass on the octopus. We will definitely be back, and will have to save room for their incredible desserts!", "author": "Stefani S."}

Service was terrible. Took three hours for all of our food ( literally took an hour between appetizer and entree ), and the best part was that there were tons of waiters but they pretty much just hung out and didn't do much.  \n\nAs for the food, the octopus and pork belly was good but the sauce didn't go well with the belly.  The mushroom pizza was no bueno (they didn't even cook the mushrooms, it looked like it was an after thought they threw on), the pasta wasn't was over sauced and just not flavorable.    \n\nWould not go back.

While we were glad to skip the wait with a reservation, we were sorely disappointed by the quality of food and service we encountered here. \n\nThe night started on a weird note when we were told no less than 3 times that we had to put our entire order in at once - no adding on orders after the waiter took the initial order. Ok, that's fine - but why stress it so much?\n\nWe ordered 2 'half' pastas which here means 2 strands of pasta each with some sauce on top. It wasn't bad - but nothing to write home about either. The pasta also took over an hour to arrive, which means they still have some logistical hiccups to solve. Don't plan to grab a quick bite here, that's for sure. \n\nWe also got a mortadella honey blossom pizza which apparently means throwing a couple pieces of cold lunch deli meat on top of a pizza after it comes out of the oven. Yes the meat was cold and slimy, and the manager told us it was supposed to be like that. They would not even heat it up when we asked. We sincerely hope no one else has to go through this experience as we would not wish it on our worst enemy. \n\nOverall our order of 3 fairly easy dishes took over 2 hours with little to no service or explanation in between, outside of the occasional water refill. \n\nThe kicker - the restaurant charges a 6% SF mandates fee which is the highest I've seen yet in the city. While I support the premise of the mandate, the %s are getting out of control, the growth being spurred by restaurants such as this one. \n\nI am really excited whenever a new buzzy restaurant opens up in my neighborhood. I just hate it when reality so poorly measures up to the hype.", "author": "Josh Q."}

My friend and I ordered the duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 which was delicious, but by the end of us each eating half, we were sick of the onion flavor. Just too rich. It took around 45 minutes for our pizzas to cook, and they came out 10 minutes between each other. I ordered the Margherita pizza, which was super tasty. We didn't like that the crust was so big compared to the rest of the pizza, and the crust is also a bit burnt. Usually I like to eat my crust, but I didn't like the charred flavor. We each ordered a drink off the cocktail list. Both were $14 each and her's tasted like pure gin, while mine tasted like lemon soda. They just weren't that great for being craft cocktails. This place was fine, but 100% over hyped. The one thing we both loved and had no problem with was THE DESSERT. Wow. The cannolis and the ice cream. I have never had such creamy delicious ice cream before. The mint tasted like fresh mint leaves and basil. Wow!

Ultimately I decided that we could have made some better ordering decisions and the cocktails were a huge let down. HOWEVER, I'm excited to go back and try again and definitely won't let my first experience hinder my next!\n\nWhat we loved: \nFirst of all, the atmosphere at Che Fico is unlike anywhere else in SF. It's like being in a trendy Italian farm house with sky lights. I love the open kitchen, the wall paper, the decor. It's beautiful and a great spot for a girls night out or a date night. I also loved our waiter Nathan who was hilarious and very energetic and enthusiastic. \nAs far as the food, the standouts were the pizza--we got the pineapple with fermented onion and while I'm normally very anti pineapple on pizza, this was out of control. The crust was exceptional and it may be the best pizza I've had in SF and I'm usually very loyal to Tony's so that's a big deal. The other standout was the rice ball arancini which was perfectly fried and filled with tomato sauce covered rice and tons of gooey cheese. \n\nWhat we can improve on: \nWe started with the caponata which was good, but I don't need to have it again. We also ordered two pastas--the malfadini and the gnudi. \nThe malfadini totally fell flat for us. It was just lacking a pop of flavor and the pasta was perhaps too al dente. It needed some lemon or garlic or spice to wake it up. I wouldn't order this again. The gnudi itself was good, but again felt like it was missing something and the sauce didn't do much to elevate the dumplings. I think next time I'd try the tagliatelle or the rigatoni which we saw on the table next to us. The cocktails were also disappointing. We each got a different one, the rosemary, basil and coriander. The basil and coriander were not good....at all and at $14 each I had high hopes. I tried all three and would not do any of them again. We switched to a bottle of wine after that (they do have an impressive Italian wine list!) \n\nAt the end, we each spent around $90 for the food and drinks. I think this is why I had a hard time coming up with my rating because I am all for balling out for a great meal, but because we weren't psyched about more than half the meal, it felt really expensive. \n\nI am very excited to come back again and feel that I can do a lot better ordering the next time around! I know it'll be worth it, this restaurant is a gem and I am very excited to give it another try! I hope you take my advice about the pastas in particular--there are definitely standouts to be found on this menu :)", "author": "Sophie S."}

Unfortunately, a lot of show without much substance is what I took away from our dinner.\n\nDecor is fantastic 5/5.\nFood is barely above average 3/5.\nService is okay. However hosts are incompetent(more on this later). \n\nWe got the pineapple pizza everyone raves about. It was good but nothing ground breaking. A solid 3.5/5\n\nThe papardelle ragu(IIRC) was again good and earthy(small serving size btw) but nothing you can't get for half the price at spots across SF. 3/5 \n\nWe had an avg eggplant spread app too, which for some odd reason is not served with any bread. Just imagine serving babaghanoush with no bread, what the hell!?  We asked the waiter for bread, she offered foccacia and didn't mention it would cost extra till we got our check. This came across as petty and cheap from the restaurant. \n\nBack to the hosts. This was a wednesday btw. Was crowded but nothing crazy. Their mangement of the two separate walk-in wait lists, one for bar area other for rest, is horrible and uncoordinated. There were 4 parties before us for the bar area and were told our bar spot will be open \"soon\". We also put name on the other wait list and were told that would be at least 2 hrs. After waiting more than 1 hr, right in front of the host mind you, and also checking multiple times with the bar wait-list manager(who was doubling as a bus-boy) we realized they had no coordination between the lists. \n\nThe host with the non-bar area wait list had spots open in less than an hour and didn't bother notifying us whereas the bar area wait-list  guy kept on saying \"soon\" since minute 1, and now it was 1.15 hrs. Eventually we got offered to sit in the non-bar area communal table, which had been open for past 30 mins. So goes without saying this left a bad taste in our mouth. \nDO one list, and offer seats based on availability. Its super basic. \n\nSo to summarize, wait extra 1 hr due to uncordinated hosts, get seated at communal table while shelling out $150 for food and drinks, where the food is barely above average. No bueno. They have had some good press due to contacts, but will most likely fizzle out, like many others have in SF, unless they step up. \n\nP.

We were quite excited since we heard a lot of good things about this place. We got a couple of appetizers (beef tongue, duck liver), a tagliatelle pasta, a pizza, and a couple desserts (they rotate their menu items so some items may no longer be available). The appetizers were good but was very heavy on either lime or vinegar sauces, as they were all quite sour. The pasta was probably the best dish  (a tagliatelle with ragu sauce). The pasta was pretty perfectly cooked. The pizza, which they're most well-known for, was probably the worst part of the meal. I know they're known for the \"charred\" crust, but I personally do not enjoy the char taste, which was pretty prominent. The pizza itself was way too salty, and I wasn't able to eat more than one slice. I had the peach cobbler type dessert that came with ice cream, which was quite sour for a dessert.

What could possibly go wrong? In this case not much if anything. I compare this restaurant to the current trend in the NBA of putting super teams together.  Typically in the history of this happening it takes about a season or two before they can come together.  Or you can be the Warriors and just add a head coach that lets his team do what they're best at and watch them waltz into the finals.  This is essentially what David Nayfeld have done.  As great as their food is here both in flavors, beauty, and texture the restaurant itself has a personality all on it's own and if we're going to use basketball references here they have truly built their Chase Center.  Aside from the fun and giant lit ups Che Fico sign the outside telling you that you've arrived the look is that of an insurance agents office from the 80's.  Till you open the door and look up the staircase and realize you're in for so much more.  I compared the experience of entering very similar to how I felt when I entered Smuggler's Cove the first time (if you haven't been there you should). Immediate surprise and delight as  you get to the top of the stairs and are greeted warmly by their hosts. The moment you glance into the dining room you know that you're in for more than just spaghetti and meatballs. You've arrived at an oasis of food in the middle of San Francisco. \n\nI've vowed to myself as a reviewer that it's not fair to tell you how much I love the taste of the food I've eaten because the truth is as diners we all have different palettes but what I can tell you is if you can't find something you love (and you will) on this menu I'd be hard pressed to believe you have taste buds anymore. The food here is some of the best you can find and the attention to every detail is proven with every bite. If you don't believe me scroll through their Instagram and you'll see the care that is put into every dish.  \n\nIf ambiance and food weren't enough the service will drive you over the top. In my first visit here I was tucked in the back corner near the bar because I was silly and didn't make reservations. The difficulty in getting to us on a busy night was tricky to say the least but our server never missed a beat the entire evening. I've had far less service with far less for a server to deal with in my dining years so needless to say my friend and I were impressed. In another outing we sat right at the bar and the staff was as sharp as they could be having to balance making drinks and serving guests. Oh which reminds me the cocktail menu is fantastic here. Great balance of flavors and assorted enough so you can find that cocktail to pair well with anything you might order. \n\nI've been pretty strict about adding anything to my regular dining rotation because frankly I hate thinking what I could be missing at one of them but it was not a difficult decision to have added Che Fico as one of my favorite dining destinations in San Francisco and look forward to many many more returns.", "author": "Joco F."}

Things started off great as we were seated upon arrival (we had reservations), those without were being told it was a 2 hour wait.  Our table was a two top but separated by a 2 inch gap from our neighboring table.  I joked with those seated next to us that we are now a table of 4.  We scooted the table over an inch or two so conversation was a bit more private and elbows weren't bumped.\n\nThe server came by to warn us there is a $30 corkage fee as we brought our own wine.  I use the word warn because it was unfriendly and nearly challenging us to change our mind about opening our wine.  The bottle was whisked away and 15 minutes later the sommelier came back with the bottle, not a word was spoken aside from \"Who will try?\"  Honestly, not another word.  By the way, it is common courtesy to respond when someone says Thank You.  Maybe the somm was having a bad day???\n\nNext we order and that will be the LAST time we see our server.  She never returned to check on our food, replace silverware, refill wine/water.  Service was a complete failure!!!  \n\nCoursing and timing of dishes is a basic skill for a full-service restaurant.  Our appetizer (chopped liver) arrived quickly and it was delicious.  Dish cleared and my wife's pasta arrives and I await the arrival of my pasta dish.  And wait, and wait.  My wife eats her entire pasta course and our server is never within view to ask about my portion of this course.  Pasta dish cleared and I'm certain they have forgotten my pasta dish but then it arrives...30 minutes after my wife's.  Within seconds 2 pizzas are delivered and there isn't enough room on the table so I'm holding my pasta dish while trying to finish it off to make room.\n\nOh wait, there she is...our server.  \"Do you want dessert?\"  That was it!  Never asked how our meal was, no apology for sorry I haven't returned in over an hour.  No thanks, we'll take the check.\n\nI say mixed emotions because the food was excellent but the service was negative 5 stars which ruined our first and likely last Che Fico experience.

We didn't have reservations and knew it would be a bit of a wait so we put our name down and got a drink at the bar. The bar has a great vibe and was really busy the entire time we were there. We were seated at the communal table which was great because we could see what dishes other people were ordering. We started with the Suppl\u00ec which is a rice ball. Delicious! We also had the octopus salad, which was also tasty. We had a pasta and pizza as our main dish and saved room for dessert, olive oil cake and blueberry pavlova. The food is flavorful and presented well. What I really liked was the service. Every person we came across was friendly and helpful.

Perhaps our expectations were outsized, but we were pretty disappointed. \n\nFirst the good news. The vibe in the restaurant is great and all the servers were fantastic. The drinks beforehand were very good, especially the \"Pepper\". The duck liver appetizer was to die for, as were the two desserts we had, the Olive Cake and the Pistachio gelato.\n\nRE: the main course, a few things. It was off putting to have the appetizer, pizza and pasta dish all delivered at the same time...it would have made so much more sense to deliver one plate at a time. The pineapple, fermented chili pizza sounded good but was meh at best...have had so many better pizzas elsewhere. And the much raved burned crust wasn't anything special. The green garlic agnolloti was both under cooked and had no taste to it. A huge disappointment.\n\nAn OK experience, but no plans to return.", "author": "Charles B."}

None of the dishes were bad but they also weren't memorable. Considering the price of $$$, I expect at least couple of dishes to be \"wows.\" Yes they are novel to our palate but novel does not equal delicious. I appreciated our server's attentiveness throughout the meal. She noticed I was the only one not drinking wine and so asked if I wanted a non-alcoholic grape drink. When she saw that I didn't touch most of it because I didn't like the taste, she took it off our tab.

Rustic Italian fare with Jewish influences shines with every plate. Restaurant space is bright and airy with multiple seating arrangements from communal tables to booths. The bar area has plenty of seating allowing diners to have a quick casual meal with their drink. The pizza is a true standout. It is truly a unique signature dish with its sourdough blackened crust topped with a heavy dose of Parmesan cheese. You can't miss the walk-in glass fridge in the center of the restaurant proudly displaying all the charcuterie goodies slowly waiting their perfect time to be served at your table. \nAfter working in one of world's best restaurants Eleven Madison Park in New York, David Nayfeld's touch of perfection is evident with every plate. You simply can't go wrong with any dish. Some of the menu items change with season and availability of freshest ingredients. On our first visit the veal tartar was a star appetizer, but it was not available on our next trip to the restaurant. Hopefully we'll get to try it again on our next visit. The bar service was also top notch with servers being able to take your order in the bar area. This allowed our bartender to focus on perfecting our next cocktail.     \nClearly San Francisco diners who are always hungry for the next best restaurant are keeping them busy. The place was packed on both Fridays when we were there up until Midnight. Che Fico is certainly a great addition to the neighborhood. All the neighbors definitely appreciate a great local place you can come by and count on consistently having a great meal. David Nayfeld, welcome back to San Francisco and thank you to Che Fico Team for a great dining experience. We look forward to our next time.", "author": "Alex K."}

Additionally, the earlier review about the extremely poor hygiene is clearly accurate because I had a severe tummy upset after eating here. We got the goat cheese triangolinis (8 pieces of pasta for $23 in an overly lemony cream sauce with pine nuts), the fried cheese (this was so gross - extremely oily and had no flavor whatsoever except for oil), and the pineapple pizza (best thing we got but it was still pretty average... definitely had better pizza elsewhere). The presentation was incredible though - as was the space (it's huge with high ceilings and lots of natural light). An antipasti, pasta, pizza and 3 cocktails later the bill was a whopping $170 (after an 18% tip). Overall, extremely disappointed in the quality of food, lazy service and the apparent poor hygiene of this place. Do yourself a favor and don't stand in this particular line....", "author": "Sam M."}

That's what happened to me when I dined at Che Fico last night.  My overall opinion was ... really?  Sometimes I think we can continue supporting a restaurant not necessarily because of what we experience there, but more so because of what we've imagined we SHOULD be experiencing.\n\nOur observation was that even though all of the staff was working incredibly hard, the service was very slow. Too add, some of the prices are way out of whack.  I'm not afraid to pay for high quality ingredients and excellent service, but I'm not sure we had either.  $15 starter for a piece of bread with (good) melted cheese and olive oil -- decent, but should have been 2 slices for the price.  The $24 portion of pasta bolognese was SMALL and the amount of sauce LACKING.  Rotisserie chicken was good and that was probably the best value of what we ordered $29.

Hype heaped on top of hype made expectations for the place sky high. So yes, Che Fico was tailor made to disappoint. Except it does not. Not on decor. Not on ambience. And certainly not on the food.\n\nThe food is Italian, with Cal influences. This may sound run of the mill but  there's a bunch of things incorporated into the menu that distinguish it from what you'd find elsewhere. The pizza is \"sf style\" and it's got a beautiful sourdough flavor and just enough volume to give it some heft. \n\nThen there's the Ebraica part of the dinner menu inspired by Chef David's Jewish heritage.. Even for folks who are well-educated in eating regional Italian, this will probably be unlike anything they've encountered. The gizzard dish is one I'm nostalgic about already.\n\nFor dessert, choose anything and be wowed. Angela Pinkerton is the apex when it comes to the last course of a meal.

The host informed us that the wait will be around 2-3 hours. Ok fine, no big deal, that's the price we pay for coming in on a Friday night without a reservations. \nSo we put our names down and head over to the bar, which is not open seating. We both get 2 really nice glasses of white wine (Arneis and Kerner) Delish! and stand around the bar area as we wait for our table\nAfter an hour, I checked in at the host stand to see where we were on the list. The host informs me that it will be another hour or so but the bar is much quicker. Why were we not informed of this in the first place?! So I put my name down for the BAR Waitlist and waited more. After another 1.5 hours, the Dining Room host (there were 4 hostesses manning the host stand that night) came by to tell us that our table was ready and she then proceeded to seat us at a bar table. Their system does not make sense! Why did I need to put my name down on two waitlist if they were going to seat me in the bar area anyway?! \n\nWe ordered 3 things from the menu \n-Margherita Pizza : the server tells us that the chef cooks the pizza well done/burnt. The pizza did come out burnt! (I understand toasty pizza but this crust was burnt, hard and difficult to eat). The pizza was also mostly crust. Can we get more pizza?!?!\n-Tagliatelle al Ragu: good but for $24, can we get more pasta? it was tiny, I'm not exaggerating. \n-Roasted Cauliflower: needed to be cooked a bit more. I personally enjoy vegetables with a bit of a crunch but this vegetable was not cooked properly. \n\nService was non existent since we were tucked away in the window corner area. We had to ask the bartender to get us more wine since our server disappeared. We didn't get the after dinner fruit because again, we didn't see our server. \nI had high hopes for this place.

Sitting at the counter is the best seat in the house because it becomes a great dinner and a great show. The seats are right in front of their antipasti section where all of the first courses are being made. These chefs were outstanding. They worked non stop with great care in making everything they put out perfect.  The care they put into every dish was amazing. We complimented them several times and as busy as they were we had fun conversations with them.  Several dishes we saw them make such as their chopped salad and their Octopus salad looked fantastic.  Would probably try one of those next visit.\nOur dinner consisted of the following (my wife and I shared everything).\n1. Started with the summer vegetable Insalata which was a blend of yellow watermelon, heirloom tomatoes, feta, and croutons. It was dressed in a creamy gazpacho that you eat like soup when you finish. Presentation was beautiful and it was delicious and different that a typical salad.\n2. We then each had what they call Suppli which is a fried risotto cone. This was stuffed with cheese and risotto in tomato sauce and fried.  Really good. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant ate these. The waiters wer always bringing out plates of these.\n3. We then shared a pasta and pizza.  The pasta was their smoked paprika strascinati which is a thick chewy pasta with lamb ragu.  The ragu was filled with lamb and was delicious. Pasta was fresh, and a type of pasta that we really enjoyed.\n4. The pizza was with sun gold tomato, mozzarella, basil, and another cheese whose name is hard to remember. Their pizzas have a burnt crust at the end but it doesn't taste burnt.  We both liked the crusts and the ingredients were excellent. We took portions of both the pasta and pizza home. Chefs behind the counter tried to convince us to try one of the desserts but we were stuffed. One of the chefs brought over a cup of pistachio ice cream that was really good.

It's quite loud and echoey since it has high ceilings and concrete walls.\n\nThe food was very underwhelming overall.\n\nGood: Corned veal tongue - the meat had a great texture and the salsa verde was funky, briney, salty and bright. This was the best thing we ordered. \n\nOk: Duck liver - the flavor of this was good but it was very wet which we found kind of off putting.\n\nBad:\nCavatelli - sorry but this was not good. The pasta was gummy, and the sauce and veggies were inedibly bitter, not to mention over cooked and under seasoned. Also don't list broccoli on the menu and then serve broccoli rabe...such entirely different vegetables/flavor profiles.I really disliked this dish.\n\nMafaldini: the past on this was pretty good, and cooked Al dente. But the fava Bean pesto was thin and flavorless, I'm not sure they actually added the hazlenuts...if they were there they were lost, I didnt get their flavor or crunch/texture, the lemon was sour in an unpleasant and bitter way, and the whole thing was under seasoned...I actually think this dish would've likely been significantly improved by salt...if we could've gotten some.\n\nOur server was very nice and super friendly but absent - it's ok, the place was very busy, and they're new.\n\nThis may seem silly but both the wine by the glass, and beer menus were weird and random and lacked a point of view.

We showed up a few minutes before our 7:30 reservations and waited 30 minutes to be seated. Not to pull the pregnancy card, but as getting a drink at the bar wasn't an option, the 30 minutes spent hungry, on my feet and being shoved around by patrons in the bar area wasn't the way I wanted to start my Che Fico experience. Once we were seated out wait staff was attentive and the food came out at a nice cadence. The triangoli was delicious and I would have definitely eaten a whole serving of that, but otherwise I was unimpressed by the food. At the table we shared a few of the salads, the arancini, the fried artichoke, lamb and chicken (TBH I regret not ordering a pizza). I am not a fan of lamb, but my dinner company did say the lamb was quite delicious, I can't speak on it personally. I found the chicken to be just OK, definitely nothing I will crave or think about again. When it came time for dessert they were out of the 2 menu items we wanted, another disappointment.\n\nThe atmosphere at Che Fico is very hip and loud, I felt like I was shouting for the 2 hour meal. I did enjoy the funky decor and it looked like they had some nice cocktails on the menu. I may give Che Fico another try once the hype dies down and I can actually enjoy an adult beverage, but until then I'll stick with Little Star next door.", "author": "Veronica F."}

The crispy artichokes were delicious with the lemon aioli, summer squash, and the two pastas we had were also winners. They allow you to get half portions of their pastas which gives one the option of trying more varieties. Despite being slathered in oil and butter, the pastas actually tasted less heavy than I would have expected. Not a huge fan of the olive oil cake, but the elderberry gelato that it came with was delectable.\n\n I was expecting terrible service based on some of the recent reviews, but actually felt very well attended. Someone would always come by to refill our water, even though we had a bottle of self serve sparkling water at the table. Despite being very full, we were never rushed to leave. Only complaint is the lack of coffee bar to have after dinner espresso drinks to go with the dessert. All around a pleasant experience though.", "author": "N c."}

Made reservations for my wife's birthday. The ambiance is great and the food is excellent. \n\nThe menu has lots of appetizers and small plates, pizza, pasta, and large secondi courses for sharing. When I go back, I'll be ordering the lamb leg for two. \n\nWe shared everything - two arancini to start, small chopped salad, margherita pizza, squid ink pasta, and half a roast chicken with broccoli on the side. \n\nOur favorites were the pizza and the broccoli. Both came from the wood burning oven, which gave a perfect charred flavor. The pizza has a great chewy crust that has some sourdough in it. \n\nThe pasta was delicious, and the house made noodles had a great chew. Chicken was solid, but has a spicy sweet glaze, which I wasn't expecting from the menu (I guess ingredients I didn't recognize). \n\nFinally, I had the bergamot aperitif and we each had a few glasses of wine. The aperitif was what you want at an Italian place - just the right balance between sweet and bitter. The wine selection is short and to the point. Very targeted Italian wines with a good spread of different regions, and enough Californians thrown in to keep people comfortable. \n\nThis place is a great addition to the neighborhood, and I'm sure we will be back soon.", "author": "Allan L."}

Beautiful space. Service needs a lot of work. Please train your servers on your POS. Had to run credit cards three times at the table beside me for add/refund/adjust because of bar bill. Advice: stop transferring bar bills to simplify the handoff. Hostess was relatively overwhelmed but polite. Amazing music (cranberries, system, primus) and good flavor balancing in dishes. Pizzas take 45' so order the suppl\u00ed and salads to start. Rigatoni was meh and came out cold, ragu could have used extra layers of flavor to make it more home style. The wine pours are say below standard and inconsistent across bartenders here (beers are in very small glasses, varying 3-4oz pours of wine), but they have a full bar. If you have a hot date or want some amazing Jewish-Italian inspired dishes head over to Che Fico. Honest 3.5 experience but will likely rise once they get their footing and up train staff.

Great addition. The buratta cheese was very creamy and randomly paired well with the cheesy rice balls for some random reason. \nThe pineapple pizza is soooooooo surprisingly good. With a torched crust and super thinly sliced pieces of pineapple. The half chicken was so juicy I'm going to have dreams about it.

The wood fired pizzas are unique and generous with interesting toppings. We tried the one with pineapple and it was stunning. The pastas are out of this world. Each one has hand made fresh pasta with a delicious sauce and vegetables. The lamb agnolotti is killer!!! Unfortunately last time it was no longer on the menu. The only misses were the bolognese. Somehow it was dry and stringy...and the pesto pasta with a long skinnier lasagna noodle. It was overly oily without enough seasoning. The chicken for two is okay, I'd skip and focus on pasta and pizza. Everything else was awesome. Apps are also varied and interesting. The octopus salad is delish, the salad with gazpacho was unreal, it was so good and fresh and healthy. There was a berry cobbler on the menu last time we went which was bursting with seasonal berries, and had a homey feel with a crispy and slightly burnt crust...so delicious. And I'm not a dessert person! The chocolate thing was just okay though. \n\nThe space is also just beautiful. Airy with high ceilings and flooded with light. Beautiful wallpaper etc. servers are courteous generally and seem really into the food and mission of the restaurant. The menu changes frequently according to what's freshest and most seasonal, but classic standbys seem to remain on the menu. \n\nTaking off a star for two reasons:\n1) food is slow to come out. Often you'll have to wait for 30 mins between dishes. They're usually packed but they should figure out how to address kitchen backlog better. Also talk about waiting...getting a table is impossible here and you can wait for hours even for a bar seat. I wish they'd figure this out better. \n2) cocktails are hit or miss. They're expensive so I was just expecting more. Many of them tasted watered down. I also wish they had more reasonable wine options. I don't always want to spend $14-25 a glass. The food is already so pricey, give people a break somewhere.", "author": "Ella M."}

We did not enjoy the polenta that came with it - it seemed like cream of wheat breakfast food.  But we did ask, if we came back again, could we have an alternative to the polenta and we were told that we could.  We also enjoyed the fire roasted peppers - tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced.  This was an excellent side dish and will get this instead of (rather than in addition to) the polenta if we make it back.  The pasta (PAPPARADELLE AL RAGU) was truly outstanding, but...it was perfect for an $8 'small plate' - not so perfect for a $28 entree.  My wife asked the waiter 'this is it?' and sadly learned that that was indeed 'it'.  If you fold a dollar bill in half, you will be able to picture the approximate size of the pasta serving.

I'm confused about the pizza, I can tell it's made with quality ingredients however the burnt crust was overwhelming.  I believe that they char it to a blackness on purpose, and I can't seem to understand it.  It made it bitter and inedible, even with the dusting of parmesan to hide the dark color.  The pasta, the orecchiette pasta was made in house but was doughy and rubbery.  Again, I could tell the ingredients for the sauce were of high quality however the actual pasta was underwhelming at best.   It was way too thick for that type of pasta.  I hate to pull the I just got back from Italy for the umpteenth time card, but yes that's the case and these two items were in no way representative of the cuisine.

You go up a flight of steep stairs and walk into a bustling and super stylish open dining room. I loved the design you can tell from the textures, patterns, and lights they spent a lot of time putting together the space which gives it this funky throwback/bohemian feel. I loved the open kitchen layout and the room of hanging cured meats. They had cute booths and then communal style tables which worked out great for us since the diners next to us were two hilarious men from New York and we shared some conversation. Our server was funny, quick and helpful. We got the octopus and pork belly which everyone loved, the chopped salad which I was hesitant about but was great and came decorated with edible colorful flowers, the Bolognese, the ode to Judy rodgers pizza which we added arugula to per our servers suggestion, this pizza was really interesting. They serve the pizza crusts kind of blackened on top which you would assume would make them taste burnt but it was perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside, the suppli was really interesting and flavorful, the cauliflower side was ok I would pass next time. But, the wood fired chicken stole the show served with an amazing creamy polenta, the chicken had perfectly crisp skin and was so juicy. My two friends said it was the best chicken they'd had. Despite how busy they were food came fast, and the service was very attentive. It's really noisy so was hard to talk across the table. So keep that in mind. But if your looking for a casual yet chic environment, with a lots of energy and great food this is your place.", "author": "T V."}

And what was such a pleasant surprise is that the staff were all so friendly, warm, and inviting (unlike most popular SF restaurants where they seem generally inconvenienced by you wanting to dine at their establishment). Gorgeous interior, killer drinks, and just an overall incredible dining experience.", "author": "Erin L."}

They have an amazing cocktail program where the bartenders take their time and product a phenomenal drink every time. The service was impeccable and I can't wait to come back for dinner next time I'm in town. Make sure and get a reservation as this is a hot ticket.", "author": "Brandon F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-21", "description": "We were so excited to try Che Fico after all the hoopla around it. Unfortunately, other than meeting wonderful guests sitting next to us, we left disappointed. The two salads and pickle dish we ordered as starters were average, but nothing exciting or to write home about. I ordered the tuna conserva because I love the one at Delfina. This one lacked the kick and excitement that the one Delfina prepares. The two pastas we ordered were overly salty and mundane. And the pizza was overly salty and nothing special. The servers were all very gracious and helpful. They were kind enough to take off all the foods we did not enjoy. All in all, we were very sad to leave feeling hungry and disappointed. The food is too heavily salted and compared to many other restaurants in the city that offer similar options (pizza, pastas, etc.), Che Fico comes up below average. I hope that over time they can learn to cut out salt and highlight the creativity of the chef and authenticity of the food. Best of luck!", "author": "Emma L."}
