They were super cheap and really large (about 2 could fill me up easily, 3 if I was really hungry). I ordered the revuelto con frijoles and chiccaron papusas. I preferred the former as it had a lot more flavor while the chiccaron was just meat (which I should have expected...). The place was pretty crowded, but it didn't look like people were waiting for a table so I'd say the turnover rate is pretty reasonable. \n\nOnly thing I was a bit disappointed by was the horchata which tasted watered down yet full of an unusual spice. It might be the Morro seed or something else that was not typical in Mexican horchata but i was not a fan. Overall really liked the place and would come back for cheap and tasty papusas.", "author": "Edmund L."}

If you do eat hear consider having a audience of people standing by the door watching you eat and ready to take your table any second you get up.\n\nFood was ok but not worth the price . I can say their are tastier Salvadoran restaurants basically in every block on mission and have better pupusas and the price is about 1.50 to 2.00 a pupusa . Another negative for me was that it doesn't matter if you order two pupusas or five they only give you a small portion of curtido which is the cabbage slaw that goes with it and if you want more it's extra $$! Seems like Their is a up charge for everything hear!\n\nAlso keep in mind that if you order to go it's an up charge so I would reconsider taking out. And it is a cash only place so keep that in mind as well.. \n\nAs for me I won't be coming back again but it was good trying it and giving you my honest opinion.", "author": "Mirna P."}

I thought I could only get this deal in the South Bay outside of the city, but La Santaneca makes it accessible to feel full, not broke, and enjoy a warm meal in a neighborhood favorite. \n\nThe only slight sad part is that there are only two veggie versions of pupusas, but that's perfect because their pupusa deal gives you two. I had the queso and loroco (wildflowers!) pupusas, which I highly recommend and will definitely order next time I come in. The loroco is a wildflower apparently, and the flavors are definitely more earthy and special however not empowering. The boys also got fried plantains which can be ordered as a side. Portions are huge and filling--my favorite! They serve water upon request and have juices and other drinks available. Almost everyone sitting inside that day we ate there (late lunch) was of Latinx background. I definitely felt like I was eating authentic food at a great price deal! \n\nThe service was a bit slower than I expected, but the tables did always seem to be full. Servers were fast to take our orders, but the food cooking took longer than I thought. We definitely waited 20-25 minutes that day for our pupusa orders. Before we were seated, we had to wait about 8-10 minutes even during the middle of the day! They also have a cute restroom sign and very quaint decor. It makes me feel very at home. It's almost as good as my favorite pupusa place in the South Bay, but it stole my heart for being a great SF place for properly-priced-pupusas.", "author": "Jodi H."}

This place is filled with locals so they must provide authentic Salvadoran food. \n\nOf course i have to have the well-known pupusas, prices are extremely reason $2 - $3 per pupusas with a minimum order of two per customer.  I arrived just before the lunch rush and waited 10-15 minutes.  The place is small and busy, need to have a better system or sign in system for a table.  Few customers just walked by us wanting to sit in the next available table.  \n\nI order two pork pupusas, it is thick tortilla stuffed with savory ground mesh pork, it also comes with cheese and bean, or pork and bean. The texture of the pupusas is chewy and doughy the pork itself has a natural meaty taste, but not crazy about pork finely meshed.  The rice is light and fluffy.  Very interesting, I would say it like quesadilla with a thicker doughy crust.  Interesting food.", "author": "Frances C."}

This is the real deal, as good and authentic as it could get!  La Santaneca have 2 location, another one in Bernard and they both get crazy packed.\n\nIf you are not familiar with pupusa, they are a traditional Salvadoran dish of a thick corn tortilla stuffed with a savory filling and served with coleslaw.  You can never go wrong with the Revueltas (pork & cheese) or Chicharron (pork).  If you are looking for vegetarian options, there's also the Queso (cheese) or Frijoles (beans).  Not only are they filling, they are very affordable too!  At only $2 - $2.25 each, order a few and pair it with some rice & beans or a sopa (soup) and you're solid.  It's one of the tastier and more affordable meal you can still get in the city!  \n\nAside from pupusa, they also serve up other traditional Salvadoran dishes including sopa, tamales, fried yuca/plantains and desserts.  Take a look at their drink menu too, they have some tasty juices as well.\n\nWhile service is always friendly, do expect a wait and service may be a bit slow, especially during lunch hours.

My favorites include the revuelta (pork/cheese) and the queso con loroco (sour cheese). Most people enjoy the revueltas and this one is worth indulging over, the pork is always tasty and the portion of cheese to pork is fair. The cheese and pork melt right into each other. I love the Queso con Loroco, though most of my friends are not fans and/or rather just order something else. The texture of the cheese is similar to fresh mozzarella, but the taste is rather sour. I recommend trying the Queso con Loroco at least once, it's very unique since Loroco is an edible flower that is specific to Central America. Take advantage of the $7 plate which includes two pupusas, rice and beans. Seriously major bang for your buck. I've also had ordered their chicken soup which is hearty and on the healthier side. \n\nPrice: Super fairly priced. Portions are generous, prices are just right.\n\nAmbiance: Lively, busy and loud. \n\nService: Friendly and quick service without feeling rushed and like they're solely in the business to make money.\n\nOverall: Authentic, tasty, affordable and just the best pupuseria in the area.

He lives far away, but sometimes on the weekends his whole family will make a trek to SF just to eat here. Okay I'm sold.\n\nFast forward a couple months, and I finally had a chance to come here with a friend for dinner Saturday around 5:30. The place was full and there was no place to write your name, so we just stood in the entrance area for 10-15 minutes until we got seated.\n\nWe shared some pupusas and also a larger plate as well. Their pupusas range from $2 to $2.50, or you can order their pupusa combo for $7, which comes with two pupusas with rice and beans. The fillings they offer are mostly some combination of pork, cheese, and beans, though they did have one with cheese and loroco, which is a type of Salvadorian flower.\n\nAccording to wiki, a pupusa is a traditional Salvadoran dish of a thick corn tortilla stuffed with a savory filling. I've never had one before and didn't know what to expect, but I loved the chicharron pupusa I got with pork only. They're definitely on the smaller side, but the chicharron filling was generous and perfectly seasoned. If I had been hungrier, I definitely would have ordered more.\n\nI only took a couple bites of the larger shared plate--carne guisado (stewed beef with vegetable)--as I wasn't too hungry, but I was very impressed with how tender and flavorful the beef was. For $10.75, you get a generous portion of beef, rice, beans, and veggies.\n\nI loved my meal here but want to come back again when I am hungrier for the full experience.", "author": "Dianna H."}

Maybe we didn't order the right stuff but the food was pretty average. The dining room was packed with Spanish speakers so I'm assuming the restaurant is at least authentic, although I've had much better food else where. \n\nWe shared the fried plantains, one order of the meat and cheese pupusas, one order of the zucchini flower pupusas and the combination platter with chile reano and tamales. \n\nThe plantains were not very ripe so it wasn't great. Maybe plantains just aren't in season yet. The pupusas were ok. They were definitely hot, but personally, I prefer a pupusa with thicker masa wrapper than the pupusas at this place. I felt like I was just eating melted cheese and not much else. The combination platter was the low light of our lunch. The chile reano was so salty and the shredded pork was stringy and there's not enough fat mixed in. The tamale was this huge blob of masa, but it didn't have any great flavored or filling. The best part was the retried beans on the plate. \n\nMaybe we should have ordered a soup or something, all in all, the food was average, nothing special.", "author": "Alice W."}

The younger server was more attentive with refilling our cabbage and salsa/sauce, but other than that, this place strong suit definitely is the food and not the service. \n\nI'm retracting my last review, and I will  definitely come back to have some pupusas, especially because they're literally right in front of the 24th Street Bart entrance, but I wouldn't expect 5 star service.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

The entire time there was a rotating cast of people lining up outside the door for a table. But that doesn't mean it's crowded or loud or has long waits. We showed up around 7 and waited about 15 minutes and got a roomy booth for the 3 of us. \n\nEven though the pupusas are cheap and good it's not like a burrito place - this is an actual sit down with table service restaurant. If it looks like the tables are full just wait outside the doors. Someone will come get you when a table opens up. There's no list or anything. \n\nI ordered the revueltas and chicharron pupusas (min order 2 for $4) along with plantain fritos  ($5.75 includes creme and refried beans) on the side and a salvadorean horchata ($2?). The plantain fritos were okay. Almost underfried because they were cut thick and were almost dry in the center. But combined with the refried beans it was really good (I don't like crema so didn't touch that). The refried beans were super tasty. Of the two pupusas the revueltas was much better. My advice is to stick with stuffing that contains cheese. I would probably order the beans & cheese instead of chicharron next time since the beans were so good and the chicharron were a little dry. I really liked the pupusas topped with lots of the oregano slaw and tios hot sauce. The horchata was different than the usual Mexican horchata - less sweet and a lot more cinnamon. BTW, this was a ton of food even though the plantains were split 3 ways. I could easily make a filing meal out of 2 pupusas but if you aren't sure you can get rice/beans for $7.\n\nService was a little slow.

My personal favorite is the pupusa \"revuelta\" (mixed-cheese, refried red beans, and minced pork). Another favorite is the yuca con chicharr\u00f3n (cassava and pork rinds). If you haven't tried this place, because you are afraid to venture to the unknown, don't be. It's really hard to go wrong with pupusas! They will be a new favorite.", "author": "Raquel L."}

I'm kinda a big deal in the pupusa community (in my own head). And la Santaneca (de mission) is the best.\n\nWhat makes their pupusas so good? I don't know, you'd have to ask them but of all the pupusas I've sampled, Santaneca has become the gold standard. Not only because of the golden crispness in which they fry up their pupusas but everything about it is flavorful. The pork is salty and porky... Cheese is cheesey... It's a more intense cheese than other places. \n\nI've also had the salvardorian chile releno here which is delicious. Everything here is delicious.\n\nOnly downside here: no beer. And their service can be a little slow. But it's still worth it.\n\nI will still continue my explorations of pupusas in this neighborhood and beyond. But it'll be tough to find anything better than la Santaneca (de mission)!", "author": "Bonnie H."}

You at least have to find out what the draw is about. I mean you are not in a location where el salvadorean food is scarce or any Latin American food for that matter. It's a place that's been going strong for years. I remember first going here with my mom when I was in 5th grade. I didn't quite understand it then, I just knew it was good.\n\nLa Santaneca is a good reason for my appreciation of cultures and food. It used to be foreign to me. Now not being able to go there when I want makes me feel foreign when I visit. \n\nIt is only right that my wife visits here with my kids. This Saturday, it was my wife and the two girls. We came here right around 10am. Like I said, it was crackin. I went right to the front counter and asked little \"pepito\" ( that's what I decided to call him) if I could put my name on the sign up sheet. Yes, I know by calling him little pepito I have called him little twice but he is a little pepito. Anyway, he told me in his rude \"scarface extra\" accent that I needed to look around and see the line. He said the line is everyone waiting and I had to wait in line. I said ok, little tike but no need to be rude. I love the food here which is why I'm here but you don't need to be rude. He kinda apologized. Eh, I wasn't going to let speedy Gonzalez ruin this.\n\nHe made up for it by getting us a table pretty quick. Menus were brought out and we knew what we were having immediately. We decided to go with pupusa revuelta which is pork and cheese, fried plantains, beans and rice, a breakfast platter, and of course my favorite sopa de res (beef soup). Heck yes Pepito, suck on that!\n\nI'll admit this is a bias review because it's part of my personal history. But yes, still bomb dot com. Only star I took back was for my little friend. I couldn't get over him. His face just looked shifty to me. The kind of guy that drinks too much wine at communion. You know the kind I'm talking about.\n\nIf you come here you have to order pupusas. They are so decently priced here and filling. Order as many different items as you can. I just love this place. I did get to speak to the owner and he is still cool. I didn't have the heart to tell him about cheech, pepito, speedy, pepe, you know what I mean.", "author": "Ryan C."}

I'm going to opt for Santaneca as mine.\n\nPupusas are slinging out of the kitchen and the piping hot little pancakes ooze pork, cheese, loroco (twenty-five cents extra), and beans. The priciest pupusa is $2, so eat up!\n\nThe soups are where Santaneca really shines though. We've so far only had the caldo de res (beef soup) and the sopa de pescado (fish soup), and both have been perfect for chilly days. Big chunks of flavorful meat, lots of veggies, and the lemons really give a nice tang to the soup. I still have no idea what to do with the accompanying tortillas, but I'm working on it.\n\nThe atole makes a nice dessert too, and it comes in a big bowl. Corn bisque, basically.\n\nNever much of a wait even though it's a small place right by the BART.\n\nThe fried plaintains are super popular, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet since the entrees are so hefty!", "author": "Kevin L."}

I was hungry, but not so hungry that I couldn't wait 30 minutes for a table on a busy Saturday night, or an additional 25 minutes for the food to be brought out.\n\nMy friend is Salvadorean, not that it matters, but I think it's cool to have your food ordered in the native language to the food you're about to eat, maybe it's a respect thing, maybe it's a street cred thing, I don't know, just feels right. \n\n*My New Favorite/Constant Craving/Human Need: Loroco Cheese Pupusas!* \n\nThese bad boys are bursting with flavor and extremely HOT and fresh. I told my man that *if* he's ever in the dog house, he can redeem himself by giving me some of these, they are just that good. It was also his first time having Salvadorean food (What! That's crazy talk, I know!) so it was funny to watch his attempts at stuffing the cabbage slaw into the hot pockets.\n\nPork and Bean Pupusas are also a solid choice and had previously been my usual until the cheese only hit my tastebuds. I got a plate with rice and refried beans, very good. My table shared the Fried Plantains with sour cream which were bomb; not too sweet, good on their own and better with a dip of sour cream. Man got a soup with taro root and tripe: no one was a big fan of this, it lacked flavor.\n\nI had a Horchata, which I am indifferent to. It had an earthy/sweet/dirt flavor/consistency, not that I've ever gotten down on dirt, but it's what I think sweet dirt mixed with water would taste like. Not the best, but live and learn. \n\nI thought this location was related to the Bernal Heights pupusaria but I got scolded by our waiter when I requested Chicharon when I didn't see it on the menu, but had recently eaten it at the restaurant of the same name in Bernal. Anyway I'm into Santaneca and since it's super Bart accessible I will likely be back asap. CASH ONLY, fyi. Enjoy!", "author": "Crystal C."}

Honestly it's so small in there that outside was the only option to wait but the fact that there was no sign up list made me feel like it was an organized. We were the only people waiting but  more and more people started to show up and actually stood in the doorway and outside which made me fearful that they would get picked before we did and there was no way I was going to allow someone to be seated before me. Once a couple left my girlfriend went in and told them that we were next which I didn't think should've been necessary but considering that they don't have a list it was.

The mamey fruit is endemic to Central America and tastes like a cross between guava and pineapple, but inherently watered down---pretty damn delish in fruit drink form! \n\nRegarding the fish soup, the broth in this beautiful dish is so rich and tomato-y with that undertone of fresh fish flavor and fresh veggies, all in the mix. I'm not sure what kind of fish is in the soup but it's decidely a whole damn fish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-25", "description": "If you ever pour out of the 24th Street BART station from the escalator and head left instead of right, chances are pretty good that you've seen this place before. The reason why it stands out is that it's a Mission eatery that actually looks pretty inviting with the nice laminated wood sign and the cleanest-looking storefront on the block near the loudest-looking Mickey D's. I was particularly interested because a colleague of mine recommended it, and her significant other is a Salvadorean. How could I resist since I loves me some homemade pupusas?\n\nOK, so I have to compare this place with my standby Salvadorean/Mexican place, El Zocalo. down the street. La Santaneca de la Mission certainly wins points on cleanliness and dare I say it, friendliness. They seem to have spent more on their decor here. But let's get to the business of the food. I think the pupusas are a dead heat between the two spots. The $1.75 Pupusa Revuelta (see my photo) was excellent, full of pork and cheese inside, although I prefer the curtido (pickled cabbage) at El Zocalo. It's just a little too sour for my taste. Next came the entrees. I had the Carne Guisada, a Salvadorean beef stew with major chunks of meat (see my photo). It's much more tender than it looks and less gut-busting when you make tacos with the hot-to-the-touch tortillas they provide.\n\nJamie W. ordered the Huevos Estilo Salvadoreano, which was a kinda salty combination of pork, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, onions and green peppers (see my photo). Both of us got refried beans, although both of us prefer black beans. I don't remember being given that option. All in all, it was very good, but I have to say I still prefer the taste and portion size of El Zocalo's Salvadorean dishes. They put dressing on their side salad, which La Santaneca most definitely does not. I also like the chips and salsa better at El Zocalo. As we know, the first impression of a place is key, and just like a blind date, you can tell whether you want to spend the rest of your life with a person or get a friend to call your cell within ten minutes to say the pipes just burst at your house. La Santaneca deserves a second date.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid Salvadorean and excellent pupusas...hey, where are the black beans?\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...clean and nice by Mission standards, for sure\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly\nTOTAL - 4 stars...happy to have another real go-to place for Salvadorean", "author": "Ed U."}

The Mission District has an abundance of pupuserias to choose from, but I always find myself coming to La Santaneca.  Undoubtedly, their specialty is making authentic Salvadorian pupusas.  The hearty dish has become a favorite of mine and this warm and welcoming restaurant is a gem in this Hispanic neighborhood.\n\nThe restaurant itself is small, yet has such an appealing atmosphere.  The walls are decorated with pictures of their native home, which adds a nice authenticity of the food you're about to enjoy.  Once you've been seated in one of their booths, a waiter brings over a menu and some drinks.  The menu offers signature Mexican and Salvadorian plates and includes:  tostadas, carne asada, soups, pupusas, etc. \n\nRegardless of my number visits, I always order the pupusa combination plate, which includes two pupusas, beans and rice.  I go with the cheese pupusas, while many of my family and friends go with revueltas (mexican sausage and cheese).  The food takes about ten to twelve minutes to get to your table and is always freshly made.  \n\nThe pupusas themselves ooze with melted cheese and are nowhere near as greasy as other pupuserias.  The freshly made masa really gives their pupusas a notch over the competition.  Additionally, once you slather the house made curtido and house salsa on your pupusas, you'll see why La Santaneca is one of the best.  The rich, yet flavorful, and spicy flavors get your taste buds going and is perfectly accompanied with beans and rice.  \n\nLa Santanecas's food is some of the best in the Mission and I can't help but recommend it to all my gringo friends.  The food is fresh, delicious, and price conscious.  After you devour your plate, be sure to spread the word; however, beware, there is another La Santaneca in the Mission, but is not from the same family, after all, there is only one La Santaneca De La Mission.", "author": "Alexander E."}

Both the pork and the pork & cheese pupusas are enhanced by the acidic curtido (basically coleslaw) and mouth-warming, watery yet spicy salsa.\n\nOrders to go require some skill to tackle neatly - the curtido and salsa are poured into plastic grocery bags, so any slight puncture can result in a pupusaster.  \n\nBeware the temptation to order based solely on the pupusa's circumference - the density of the tortilla and meat pack quite the filling punch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-25", "description": "La Santaneca, located right across from the BART station next to the McDonald's, serves the best, most consistent pupusas in the city.  It is cash only, so break out the $10 bill for two people, because that's all you'll likely need to leave satisfied\n\nFor those that have never heard of a pupusa, it's a Salvadoran staple food of fried masala and cheese, sometimes with Central American bacon pork or refried beans, topped with optional pickled cabbage.  If that doesn't sound awesome alone, then you can stop reading.  We usually order the pupusas revueltas (with sizzling white quesillo and pork), and a Salvadoran tamale, filled with potatoes and pork or chicken, much thicker and heartier than your typical Mexican tamale.\n\nA good pupusa doesn't get soggy, balances the main ingredients perfectly, and will always leave you satisfied.  La Santaneca does this perfectly, and does it consistently.   After trying a fairly exhaustive search, this has become our regular stop for pupusas.  The white quesillo cheese just oozes deliciously out of the pupusa as you make your first bite, with a nice stretchy quality you would expect from a pizza.  The pork is just salty enough to provide a good change-up of flavor, and they hold together perfectly in the masa pancake.\n\nIt's not the healthiest thing in the world, but you'll find yourself craving something you didn't even know existed after you're done.", "author": "Jeff Y."}

Saw La Santaneca and was excited to try their papusas, after having being an El Zocalo fan for quite some time.  I'm so glad all the other places that night were closed, because we probably would not have seen this place, my new love.\n\nWe ordered the two papusas platter, one pork, one cheese.  Holy lord these were some taaaasty papusas.  The cheese was gooey and oozy and crunchy in the right places.  The puerco was juicy and flavorful, not dry and hard to swallow like others I've had.  La Santaneca had completely revived my faith in meat filled papusas.  What I liked the most about the papusa was the dough.  I'm certainly no papusa expert, but I know when I really like doughy goodness and this was the best papusa dough i've had yet.  Pounded and mashed to perfection.  Not too thick, not to dry or chewy. YES. \n\nWhat surprised the most about the meal, is that we also shared the Flautas con Pollo.  When they say \"guacamole and sour cream\" they mean an entire fresh avocado sliced on top of your flautas with mexican crema galore (see: photos).  Again, the pollo was not dry, overly pulled, or hard to swallow.  I seriously took out the chicken, ate it on its own, and wrapped it up in the corn tortillas because there was so much goodness!  The rice they make is also great, light and fluffy, perfect with slightly runny refried beans, and a whole lot of papusa-flauta greatness  goin around. Oh and we got the platanos just because we had to, and that was also an unexpected surprise!  Not just fried platanos, but very deliberately friend platanos.  Good flavor, not too oily, and the perfect texture.\n\nTwo dishes, one side, and two drinks for only $25! No complaints at all.  Service wasn't noticeably bad, nor noticeably good.  All around great experience, good homey crowd, great food.  Take note, when you go to the bathroom, you get to walk near/in the kitchen and see all the magic happening.  The decor is fun, welcoming, and interesting too! Hope to see you here!", "author": "Rachelle F."}

With dim lighting, spacious red tile floor and wooden layout, this place is very clean, organized, and often filled with pupusa enthusiasts of all ages looking for a quick fix. I was here twice, once for brunch and another for dinner, and few can complain about the cost of these beautifully seductive pupusas at $1.75 each. The first time I had the pupusa revuelta and pupusa chicharron with rice and beans combo ($7 w/tax). These warm pupusas came in the shape of the moon with silky refried beans and delicious Spanish rice to go with sour curtido. My revuelta was filled with pork and cheese while the chicharron was hearty and plentiful. They were really delicious and reconfirm all the reasons why I love to get my hands on these big fat pupusas.\n\nIn my next visit for dinner, I went with the server's recommendation by ordering the combination seafood soup ($15.10 w/tax). With the broth sour and tangy that resembled a milder version of seafood sinigang, my huge bowl was filled to the brim with shrimps, mussels, large chunks of fish, calamari, whole baby crab, and clams. The concept was delicious with robust natural seafood broth and a degree of tang for the wow effect. The only down side was that everything still had its shells so the benefits of using them as anchors for flavoring was also a major barrier to a hands free dining experience. All except the baby crab which was difficult to eat, I absolutely love the thick pieces of fish that still had a lot of moisture and the overflow of clams and mussels was just outright sensational. In addition to the soup, I thought the side of corn tortillas was generous and decent, but the complimentary chips and salsa were a bit watery and generic. It was overall a hearty meal and something that two people could've shared. \n\nAlthough the food costs more than El Zocalo or any of the other places nearby, but the value you get in return is their persistence in keeping the place clean and presentable by wiping everything down daily, including the condiments. Service was slow and distanced during my initial visit but decent during the dinner. For the price, quality, and value, I definitely rank this place among the best in the Mission. I thought the soup was a bit expensive for a cash only place, but for pupusas I would rank them the same as El Zocalo but the lack of variety in the pupusas puts them a grade below Balompie Cafe.", "author": "Daniel L."}

The corn tortilla was cooked up to perfection, with a deliciously tasty chicharr\u00f3n, bean and queso filling.  The rice and beans definitely weren't an afterthought; they were very flavorful and complemented the pupusas nicely.  Throw on the curtido (cabbage slaw) and salsa, and you have a pupusa party on your plate!\n\nOverall, the food takes center stage here.  It's a homey restaurant, nowhere like the \"hole in the wall\" other people are suggesting.  The service was great, friendly and made me want to come back.  In fact, when I asked for a to-go box for my left over pupusa, they brought over a small bag of curtido and salsa to go along with it.  It may seem insignificant, but it really made my day knowing that I could eat my leftovers later along with all the fixings. \n\nI'm pretty stingy with my five-star ratings (I'm Asian after all...), but this place rightfully deserves it.

DON'T JUST LIMIT YOURSELF TO THE PUPUSAS, though you'll be doing yourself a great disservice.\n\nShorty and I were making the rounds to the various and sundry tschotskerias on Mission the other day when Shorty started making these sad little half-clucking noises, which when asked Shorty said were the noise chickens make when they freeze to death. Shorty then elaborated that every day hundreds of thousands of chickens were cruelly frozen to death in the name of stocking our supermarkets with frozen chickens. Rather than trying to delve into all the intermediate steps like depriving the chickens of their god-granted feathers and giblets, I decided to take Shorty somewhere where we could fill Shorty with something warming and reviving.\n\nConsequently we stopped in at LSDLM and bypassing the pupusas, opted for big bowls of caldo (soup), for Shorty Caldo de Camarones (shrimp soup) and for me Caldo de Patas (pigs foot soup). For $9-10 we got huge bowls of soup. Shorty's featured a richly seafood flavored tomato-colored broth and 8-10 large shell-on shrimp (no heads much to Shorty's disappointment -- probably went to making that great broth) and a couple of good sized knots of scrambled egg. Mine had several big chunks of pigs feet, sawed into easily manageable pieces, squares of beef tripe, and a piece of corn and a big chunk of yucca in a menudo-like red-chile spiked broth (it also came with a small dish of chopped onions and cilantro). Factory-made, but nicely griddle toasted corn tortillas came on the side, we also split a Pastel de Carne, a deep fried ball of minced beef and potato wrapped in some kind of dough and served at center of the sun like temperature. All really good stuff.\n\nExtra credit for their ultra-clean bathroom which you access by walking by the cadre of women patting out and slapping pupusas on the massive griddle. Only minuses would be the crowding if you don't time things right, the store-bought tortillas, and the can be forgetful (this time they weren't) service.\n\nGood stuff, and Shorty isn't making tragedy-stricken chicken noises anymore.", "author": "Ed T."}

Why the F#$% have I not been here in years, decades actually. \n\nThis is one of those places that makes me nostalgic for the 'good ol days.'  Way back when my cares in this world were what toy was I going to con my parents out of buying me or what radio station was I going to play in the Aerostar van.  Oh and my sibling's and I were brats too, my parents were nostalgic for food from the motherland and we never were so this place was convenient, they could buy us happy meals right next door, ha!\n\nAnywho I decided to try it again, an acquaintance of mine had told me he LOVES the pupusas here and I said what the hell, lets give it another try.  I ordered a couple pupusas and an authentic Salvadorean horchata.  The pupusas were excellent!  The curtido (cabbage slaw) was on point, with peppers, a very nice kick.  The service was good, cute waiter, attentive and quick.  I am a fan once again, why I quit I will never know.

Located at the intersection of 24th Street and Mission Street in San Francisco, it may be difficult to spot this \"diamond in the rough\", hole in the wall restaurant. If you haven't had food from El Salvador, specifically pupusas, give La Santaneca a try. \n\nAt about $1.75 each, the pupusa is a round, flour/corn treat wrapped around your choice combination of chicharron (pork), refried beans, chicken, or cheese. It is served with the native vegetable mix, a shredded, cabbage-like vegetable with a pickled taste.(in addition, I like to spread salsa over the pupusa as well). Definitely different. Most newcomers to pupusas underestimate the density of these little pupusas and order too much. I think the average person should be satisfied with two, maybe three at most. Also your meal is served with chips and spicy salsa. I don't know what it is about places that specialize in El Salvadorean food, but their salsa tends to be more runny as opposed to thick and chunky. Still, a delicious compliment.\n\nThe wait staff is friendly and accomodating. During busy times you may have to wait for a table or for your meal a little longer, but it is worth it, and you never have to wait a ridiculous amount of time. When all is said and done, you will be full from some of Santaneca's delicious pupusas, and even with a drink and their very delicious flan dessert you'll still have some money in your pocket to save for a rainy day.", "author": "Danny H."}

Their pupusas are delicious and cheap plus they come with a spicy salsita and that delicious vinegary coleslaw, and the rest of their food is quality as well. The servers and everybody who works are really nice too. For dessert try some Salvadorean special treats, as well as their hot chocolate.", "author": "Gina R."}

The first time we ordered the bean and cheese and accidentally got the everything pupusa- what a wonderful mistake- delicious! I have since had the bean and cheese too yummmm- I cna't wait to try all of them. Plus they are super cheap $1.65/pupusa. Two pupusas and some pickled cabbage is plenty to fill you up for dinner. Also the place has a great ambience and the people who run it/work there are really nice and friendly.", "author": "Jane K."}

I have been searching high and low for decent pupusas and I have finally found them: La Santaneca de la Mission has the most perfect pupusas I have ever known.\n\nAlso good: fried yucca, anything with platanos, and the breakfast calamientos plate... Stick with the Salvadorean fare here--you can get good Mexican food anywhere in the city but Salvadorean is harder to come by and this is where you get it!\n\nOH! And the horchata here is amazing, obviously freshly made (unlike some places where they use a powder mix). Mmmmm.\n\nI really like the place aesthetically, too. It doesn't have that fluorescent lighting that so many of the fast-food Mexican places in the Mission have. It's dimmer and so much more appealing. It's very clean, and it has sit-down service. The waiters are really really sweet. Also very fast! We got our food maybe 10 minutes (if that) after ordering.\n\nNB: CASH ONLY.", "author": "Eva G."}

Two quite large pupusas plus rice and beans is $5.50. That's a deal.  Used to go to Balompie for my cravings, but this is a great option.\nThe empanada is fantastic.  Mashed sweet plantain filled with a huge amount of \"milk\" - basically milk pudding oozy yummy goodness mmmmmmm.  And it's fried.  If you like fried plantains, try this sometime.\nThe tamal de pollo was really good, too.  Very moist and steamy, and not at all bready.  There was some shredded chicken, potato (maybe yucca) strips, a few chickpeas and pepper.  It's not stuffed full of meat, but the masa was so flavorful and moist that I was glad to have more it that.  Fairly large.\nYou'll need to walk it off, but it tastes great.\nNo alcohol - not sure if that will change.", "author": "C G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-03", "description": "Yummy.  The pupusas are so delicious and filling, and I like their spicy cabbage on the side.  The platanos are kind of overpriced for what you get, and boy are they greasy...not to say that's bad.\n\nIt's a very good deal for what you get.  Be warned that they close pretty early in the evenings, so don't just show up at 8:30 as you'll probably be out of luck.", "author": "Frank S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-06-28", "description": "i died and went to papusa heaven.  so conveniently located close to BART.  so yummy.  so tasty.  i love the way the cheese squirts out the sides on the grill so you get these chewy crusty bites of yummy fried cheese.  slow service (i believe this to be the hallmark of any good pupusaria) but who cares?  you need the time to build up the anticipation of the pupusa goodness to come.  plus, you don't want to be rushed anywhere after pupusa consumption.  it isn't good for the digestion.", "author": "Samantha W."}

It's such a cute little place, the people are nice, and everything is good. My faves: pupusas, fried plantains (I hate bananas...like deathly hate bananas...and love love love these plantains), their prawn sopa: all good. Even their beans are above average deliciousness (much to the bf's chagrin). I came here 3 days this week and still want to go back tomorrow!!!! Oh how do I love thee pupusas!", "author": "Emily W."}
