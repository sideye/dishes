I was equally excited to see rotti, flaky buttery burmise flat bread, on the menu.  One of each yes please!\n\nKhai Mun Gai\nIf I'm rating this against basic poached chicken, I guess it passes.  I did not care for the bone bits or the moist cabbage it sat on...my use of \"moist\" was as necessary as that cabbage.  To make matters worse, the garnishing cucumbers were not fresh.\n\nGarlic/Ginger Rice\nDid I order rice or porridge???  This lukewarm mush showed evidence that the chef knew what he was serving but does not care if quality is inconsistent.\n\nRotti w/ Yellow Curry Sauce\nFor an appetizer that cost 70% of my main, the execution fell flat.  The infant size rotti was moist over it's preferred flaky presentation, cut into small triangles, and accompanied by a choice of three Curries.  The yellow curry is the only reason why this restaurant received two stars.  It was everything you would expect in a curry.\n\nDisclaimer\nI ordered my food for delivery via Grubhub.  For some of you, this may change the way you view my review, and that's okay.  I actually hope the food is  better onsite. However, there's a difference between delivery related issues and poor hospitality management.  If restaurant's are willing to charge the same price or in some cases more for delivery service, they should accept the expectation for parallel dinning experiences.", "author": "Venney B."}

We've only eaten Thai food once or twice, so we just guessed at what might be good. We ordered the seafood fried rice and a chicken plate with rice and sauce on the side. The fried rice was great and sort of reminded me of Peruvian food because of the onions, tomatoes mixed with the rice. My only complaint is the calamari was a little chewy, but overall a very flavorful dish. The chicken plate came with various pieces of chicken (both dark and white meat), and rice. Without the sauce it was very bland, so thank God there was something to give it life. Would not order that again. We also got two beers and the lychee sake. The latter I would not order again because it was too sweet.\n\nThe service was weird because the servers were all sitting at a table eating, so they rarely checked on us and it was hard to get the bill when we were done.

It sounds like most of them have been for poor delivery and takeout experiences. Y'all need to try getting off the couch and dining here in person sometime.\n\nI've eaten at House of Thai 2 many times for dinner. I love the setup of the dining area, it's a great date spot. There are wooden booths built into the sides of the walls with huge cushy pillows. It's fun to sidle up next to your SO and sit together on the pillow side.\n\nMore recently, I think they've done some redecorating as far as the wall decals are concerned, with scenes of South East Asia. The decor has always been great but I think this was a cool addition.\n\nHouse of Thai 2 has great food and is reasonably priced, it's definitely one of the best places to get Thai food within a mile radius (as well as Lers Ros). My SO and I ate here last night and for two entrees, an appetizer, and two beers each, it was $45, not including tip. \n\nBeer is $3 and Wine is $5 during their Happy Hour. The \"Golden Bags\" appetizer is a must, they are crunchy stuffed deep fried wontons that come with a sweet onion and cucumber dipping sauce. They are crunchy, crisp, and not greasy in the least. We also ordered the Kao Soy, which comes with the small/medium flat egg noodles and the Duck Rice plate (don't remember the name). Both dishes were rich and flavorful, very filling, and a delight to consume. I've also had success with the Tom Kha, Pad Thai, and curries in the past. Basically every time I come here I am willing to try something different, just because everything is so good at the atmosphere is so pleasant.\n\nThe servers here are very accommodating and friendly, I have never had anything less than stellar service.", "author": "Megan D."}

One time, my friendly pug ran out to greet the delivery guy, he snaps at me and tells me he is super busy and has three other deliveries after me.

Super flavorful, and at first I thought there were only mushrooms and tomatoes, but found the shrimp at the bottom. There was also a lot more than I thought because it came out in bowl rather than the typical \"hot pot\" serving dish you find at other Thai restaurants.\n\nThe yellow curry with beef was only okay. It may have been our fault for getting brown rice with the dish, but it was bland, and wasn't mind blowing. However, on the other hand, the pad thai was amazing.

The positives: Nice setting and pleasant staff. The cons: Portions were small, about 1 and 1/2 cups per ala carte items. Rice was extra charge and determining why proved to be difficult. Just bring a family sized dish of rice with a table, bigger tables bring more. Yellow curry was spicy, it is supposed to be the mildest but needed much more coconut milk. The duck salad was too salty, and didn't have enough mint and cilantro. Might be back but not likely, still looking for somewhere to replace Little Thai in San Francisco.", "author": "Nick W."}

The $9 curry rice plates are one of the best dinner deals in the Lower Haight.\n\nThey get a lot of delivery/take-out volume, but the ambiance and service are nice enough to merit a sit-down meal.\n\nTheir interpretation of 'spicy' is a little more aggressive than other Thai places in SF.

We ordered through Eat24 and everything alright. However, the delivery boy, after giving me the food, stands there and says how the payment isn't incomplete.\n\nI had paid with my card through eat24.

Also, be warned that I'm not an expert on authentic Thai food but I did at least grow up in Southeast Asia so I have some basis for comparison.\n\nPro tip:  In general if you have a choice of meat with a stir-fried dish, know that the chicken will be dry and the pork is usually miles better.  I don't eat much red meat so can't speak for the beef.\n\n\n---- DRY NOODLES ----\n\nPad See Ew:  5 stars\nYummy, they have the sweet sticky soy sauce down! Reminiscent of the best fried carrot cake dishes in Singapore.\n\nPad Thai:  4.5 stars\n\nKao Soy:  2.5 stars\nI just really didn't like the texture of these steamed egg noodles, perhaps it's just personal preference.  The curry sauce was okay but chicken strips were dry.  The best part of this was the crispy noodle bits they served on the side.\n\nRad-Na:  3 stars\nWide flat rice noodles in lots of gravy, but the gravy is so salty!  I would've loved to drink all the sauce otherwise.  And the chicken (cut in thin strips) was pretty dry.\n\n\n---- NOODLE SOUPS ----\n\nBeef Noodle Soup:  3.5 stars\nDelicious beef balls, lots of other fatty beef and organs.  Good for when I'm ill and need a hearty soup.  Asked for reduced salt.\n\nDuck Noodle Soup:  4 stars\nI asked for reduced salt / MSG and it still turned out super flavourful.  Duck meat was delicious and juicy, we couldn't stop though we were stuffed.  They give so much duck meat, this lasts me two meals when I order it delivery.\n\nPork Leg Stew Noodle Soup:  4 stars\nDelicious soup and fatty pork leg!  Again, reduce the salt.\n\nChicken Noodle Soup:  5 stars\nOkay, HOLD UP.  How have I been ordering food from here for over 2 years and this is my first time getting this?  If you have eaten in the hawker centres / food courts of Singapore growing up, you will recognise this familiar, pure chicken broth taste it is amazing and reminds me of home.  Many Thai / Vietnamese / Americanised Chinese soups I've tried skew too sweet or too salty, but this has the perfect balance and the chicken flavour shines through.  The chicken is just boiled chicken but still better than the chicken that comes with rice and noodle dishes.  Gosh I would eat this every week--when I'm craving a legitimate Asian flavour, when I want something light, when I'm feeling under the weather.  It's more \"bland\" than the other noodle soups so if you want something really salty, get the Duck Noodle soup and if you want a punch of flavour get the Tom Yum soup.  But if you know what's up -- get this chicken noodle soup.\n\n\n---- OTHER SAVOURY DISHES ----\n\nChicken Satay:  3.5 stars\nSurprisingly good and tender, but not as flavourful or chewy as Singaporean marinated satay of course.\n\nPed Yang: 3.5 stars\nTheir duck is fantastic, but why get this when you can get the duck noodle soup?\n\nKao Pad Gang Khew: 4 stars\nGreen curry paste fried rice. Yummy and flavourful rice, but the chicken strips were a bit dry.  Their pork in general is better than .\n\nYellow Curry Chicken:  3.5 stars\nStandard.  Satisfying.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice:  4 stars\nPineapple chunks, cashews, egg, onions, even raisins and carrots up in your rice.  Sometimes you're just craving it.  And House of Thai has your back.\n\n\n---- DESSERT ----\n\nRoti:  4 stars\nHow can something so simple taste so good?  Crispy dessert roti oozing with sweet condensed milk.  Goes great with yellow curry.", "author": "Letitia L."}

My boyfriend and I were stoked to hear that House of Thai 2 was going to be the replacement restaurant for the revolving-door-of-Thai-restaurants on Haight Street. Before co-habitating, we both could order from H.O.T. in the Tenderloin, but our new digs were too far away for delivery. (Serves us right for moving to the \"Quad\" which is hopefully a name that will never stick for the Castro/Mission).\n\nBefore H.O.T. 2 opened, we branched out to a few other neighborhood Thai spots, but we always found ourselves comparing it to our favorite. And while we patronized the actual restaurant itself when possible, sometimes, you just want Thai delivered to you without getting out of your pajamas, although we would fit in perfectly with the TL crowd if we did venture out in our PJs.. but I digress.\n\nSimply everything we have had is delicious. A bit greasy, but full of flavor. Our favorites include Pad Kee Mao and Pad Se Ew, complete with a start of Por-Pier Pak (Veggie Egg Rolls), and it has yet to disappoint. The Pad Kee Mao is great spicy, although we douse everything in Sriracha anyway for more of a kick.\n\nWe have yet to eat-in at this location, so we can only judge on delivery, and delivery time is either ridiculously fast, or GrubHub is estimating too long of a wait.

I've been to at least twenty thai food spots in San Francisco, (probably 75+ in my life) and this one is hands down the worst.  I came here with my partner tonight and we were both disgusted by the entire experience.  \n\nFirstly, the service was poor.  Even though we were one of only three groups in the restaurant, we were rushed to order, and our servers openly chided us for not purchasing an alcoholic beverage.  Neither my partner nor I are 21.  Our waitress made a scene, and it was very embarassing (for her), as it came off as incredibly immature.\n\nSecondly, when I went to move one of the pillows, I was so grossed out to find BUGS all over the benches.  This would not have been so bad if those were the only bugs, but they WERE NOT.  I glanced first at the walls, and then at the ceiling and under the table, and I  found that there were bugs plastered on every surface in the entire seating area.  My partner and I made to leave immediately, but the server forced us to wait and purchase their food, which was honestly very annoying.  We took the food home with us, and decided that we ought to at least try it after having been forced to waste our hard earned money.  \n\nAnd guess what?  THERE WERE BUGS IN THE FOOD. Crawling, wriggling, and moving in and out of our rice noodles.  \n\nHonestly, I have never been so disgusted; I felt like I was going to throw up.  I have no idea how any restaurant can survive with such blatant violations of basic cleanliness.\n\nWe reported the restaurant and hope that it will either be shut down or cleaned up.  We will not be returning, and will warn our friends and family to do likewise.", "author": "Imelda M."}

Haight. You can get better Pad See Ew at Thai Thai Noodle on California & Hyde. Pumpkin curry was delish - would definitely get it medium spicy as dishes here aren't too over the top. \n\nIn general, all of the dishes ordered here have too much salt - papaya salad comes with dried shrimp on top that adds to the saltiness (a dish which already has plenty of sodium from the fish sauce dressing) and pad see ew (the noodles are a dark brown color rather than the golden color that's typical). I'd definitely come back for the curry - flavors of the pumpkin curry are very comparable to Modern Thai on Polk St. \n\nIf you go when it's busy, the restaurant gets a quite warm inside because there's nowhere for the hot air from the kitchen to go - makes it a bit uncomfortable depending where you sit.\n\nOverall, good food, but not my favorite Thai restaurant in the city.

In fact I ordered them together because I was ready by the time they came by. I'm not even sure they realized they didn't take my drink order yet. The waiter was hard to communicate with. I wanted a cup of Tom Yum, not a full order since I was dining alone. But the server could not understand what I meant by cup of soup or single serving or small. He responded by saying \"chicken?\"  I gave up. I also had to point to the numbers on the menu because he didn't know the numbers when I said them allowed. \n\nIt was very busy. Lots of people in and out picking up and ordering to go. So it's very popular in the neighborhood. It was very clean the atmosphere was great but no AC. Back of the restaurant gets very warm!  \n\nI did check in on YELP so I got my free Thai Iced Tea and it was delicious. I also ordered a Thai dish I've never had. House of Thai noodle and that was excellent as well. I ordered medium spice and it was not spicey at all. I'm guessing he didn't understand me or forgot.  My Tom Yum soup with medium spice on the other hand was VERY spicy.  Both were good. No complaints about the taste of the food. \n\nEverything was very fresh.

The only downside was that the place was running extremely hot for some reason, but they relocated me to a spot by the window to their credit. Hopefully this is just a temporary issue. Very happy to give this a 5 story rating!\n\nEDIT: Went back twice more! Got the pumpkin curry and then the pad see ew. All incredible! Make sure to ask for the spice tray for the pad see ew though :)", "author": "Michael B."}

Went for lunch but will come back for dinner next time.   My only wish is that they would have some kind of lunch special - may not be but feels odd to order an entree at lunch.", "author": "Eric H."}

Tasty, but it left me hungry hours later.  The brown rice came on one side of the black plastic dish and was more plentiful than the entree.", "author": "Chad P."}

Their pad Thai and chicken larb salad are amazeballs. They're not stringy with the meat and tofu like most places. Good portions and decent pricing. Parking can be really hard though and sometimes it's really busy. Awesome food and clean place", "author": "Jewlz L."}

I live across the street and I've been through the countless iterations of Thai restaurants in this spot, patronizing them all. While the food at Thai House 2 TASTES better than the previous iteration, it has given my husband and myself food poisoning three times. THREE TIMES. I feel like a fool for giving them more chances but after last night, no longer. We both always order the same dish and after the first two times we swore off the restaurant for months. I don't know why but I was really craving Thai last night and we decided to give it another go. We didn't have anything too fancy, just a curry, some pad thai and satay. HOLY FOOD POISONING. I almost had to call an ambulance for my husband to get him to the hospital because he was in such a bad state. Normally I'd write off a single incidence of food poisoning but after three times I STRONGLY recommend avoiding this restaurant. It tastes good but I'm no longer willing to gamble with my health.", "author": "Patrice S."}

Main entree was supposed to be pumpkin curry with tofu, but it came with chicken, so couldn't eat it. The other 2 dishes (egg rolls & pad kee mao) tasted okay but were barely warm.

I went last night and had the Pumpkin Curry with brown rice which was a large portion and excellent. My roommate got the Pad Thai, which was a smaller portion but he said tasted excellent.

Out of all the Thai places on haight street this ranks among my top two favorites. I haven't been able to bring myself to order anything but the crab noodles or crab fried rice. Huge portions for a meal less than 10-15 bucks. Just a warning that their spicy is SPICY!", "author": "Christina C."}

This is not a review of the food - it might be quite good, but I did not get to find out.  I ordered delivery on a Sunday at 7:30 and given the delivery window of 60-90 minutes - at 100 minutes the food had not been delivered so I called. The receptionist told me that my food was still in the restaurant because they were busy - there was no apology. Starving, I cancelled my order and will not ever order delivery from this restaurant.", "author": "Tighe B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-17", "description": "I ordered a delivery for a rice dish via Yelp. According to Yelp menu the item was supposed to come with rice. There was an option to make it ala carte by paying an extra $2. I assumed ala carte would mean that the dish was bigger. Well, apparently the ala carte option meant that they left the rice out. I received a tiny portion without rice. I called the restaurant and asked for the rice. They told me that the ala carte option doesn't come with rice. I told them that in the menu on Yelp it was indicated that the dish always comes with rice. The restaurant repeated me three times that what I ordered doesn't come with rice, no matter how I tried to tell them that their menu stated otherwise. I cooked my own rice. I asked Eat24 to change the menu and they told me that they called the restaurant to bring me rice. When I already had the rice in a boiling water the restaurant called me and told me that they could bring rice in 15 minutes. I told them not to bother, as the rice I was cooking would be ready by then. The second star is for them calling me back afterwards.", "author": "Tomi M."}
