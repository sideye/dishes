It's tucked away right off of China Town in the Finance District, and easy to miss, since it is a small back alley.  Ever since discovering this place, I make it a point to go when visiting San Fran.  Some restaurants have been there for a while, B44, others change.   That's about the only disappointing thing.  Had a really great happy hour lunch at the restaurant next to B44 couple years ago, and now it is gone.  Oh, well, more reason to try the new place.

I come here for happy hour drinks at Voda, for business lunches at Bistro 44, and an occasional romantic dinner at Plouf.  The attraction is the outdoor seating in the heart of the Financial District and the food which is always good.  By the way I have no idea if it actually is authentically European, but frankly every place in SF is a \"fusion\" of some sort.....so I think of this alley as Euro-Fusion.  Very satisfying in so long as you don't actually try to compare it to the real thing.  Oh and hopefully you won't mind sharing your lunch with the pigeons underfoot.\n\nIt's my perfect spot for spending a long ass lunch skipping work on a balmy day.", "author": "Ke-Bear Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-09", "description": "You know those rare balmy nights we had just lately? God those are my favorite.  They are the reason for outside seating.  So when especially balmy night came, no matter how much I didn't have my phone, didn't have money and already had plans to go to another bar, I needed to spend some time outside.  I needed to chill out and bask in the fortune of good weather and pretend it is like this every night.  I needed Belden Place.\n\nIt is said that this alley reminds people of some Mediterranean town with all the little outside tables squished together and different southern European cuisines.  I can see that.  That's the main reason I love it.  But it is not quite European enough to deserve five stars.  I can't remember anytime I was walking through downtown Nice or Aix and was accosted by maitre d's to come eat at their establishment.  \n\nAnd when the waiters came by, they also had an air of \"make yourself at home, I'll be your server.  That means I bring take your order and bring your food.  You will not see me unless I choose to be seen. You will get a business smile, not a friendly smile because I'm not your friend. If you whip out a book I won't bother you until you call me.  I might come by every once in a while to see if you are alright, but that is very 'once in a while' because truly I could give a flying fuck about your American ass.  You will conform to how I choose to serve you and you will like it. And you will tip me because you don't know that it is included in the price.\"  They have mastered the art of being a server AND being French \n\nBut sadly this is America and we have no idea how to be French.  We totally know how to be American though in all our fake kindness and concern and desire to sell and make a large tip and flip the tables. That aloofness that I am so fond of in French waiters and the French in general just comes off as lack of concern here.  I'd like to see what they would do if I come back on some random warm Saturday and bust out a book and sit there for 3 hours.

Despite the lovely atmosphere, the service was sub-par and the food was average at best. First of all, the maitre d' sat us down at a table, and then asked us to move to a \"better\" table. This was only to make room for a party of 8 that ended up sitting next to my girlfriend and I. Here are the other two things that were worth mentioning:\n\n\"Salted\" Oysters: We finally get our waiter's attention, and order drinks and  an appetizer: oysters. This sounded like a good idea as a start to a nice evening. To give you an idea of the taste, imagine that an entire bag of salt had been poured all over a small, cold oyster. Honestly that's what it tasted like, with a fishy aftertaste. Needless to say, we sent them back, and prayed we would get sick later.\n\nCockroach on my Lap: I am not making this up. After some decent main courses, we were discussing our plans for afterwards. I look down on my napkin on my lap, and see a small, winged roach crawling around. This was absolutely disgusting, and I was ready to leave. We got our bill, and did not mention the roach.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-07", "description": "Cafe Bastille\nThis is my favorite restaurant on this alley. In the middle of the financial district, yet so far away from it - one is reminded of Europe. \n\nI am never disappointed here - perhaps because the food is yummy, the environment European and the service great.  Love being able to sit outside under the heat lamps and enjoy a meal for hours without being rushed. \n\nMy favorite is their fillet mignon - just mouth smacking, lip licking good. Usually part of the specials available on the weekends. \n\nThe Braised Lamb Shank is delicious too. It's a large helping so if you're hungry order it as you don't want to waste this entree. Served with mushrooms, baby carrots, garlic new potatoes, caramelized shallots in a Pinot Noir sauce. \n\nhttp://www.cafebastille.com/", "author": "shagun b."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-01", "description": "Love the outdoor ambiance, especially on a Friday night. My roommates took me here for my birthday and I went to their website to check out the restaurants and the menu in this alley. My roommate Anna's favorite is Cafe Bastille but I didn't find out until we were already seated (and waiting for her) in Cafe Tiramisu. Great location - few blocks from Montgomery Bart and right in the heart of financial district. The Belden alley is hard to miss once you're standing in the Kearney and Bush intersection. Once you start walking in, each waiter will be all over you and will try to get you to sit in their restaurant. So, be strong and take your time to check out the menu from each restaurant before you decide. Overall, I agree with some of the previous reviews of the restaurants, which mostly say that the food is not as great and are kind of pricey but the ambiance is just wonderful and that it's a great place to people-watch or to unwind from a busy day.", "author": "Joselita T."}

I used to work a mere two blocks away from here and enjoyed several Friday dinners and drinks with the crew.  There's nothing better than spending the evening under city lights, city noise, and heating lamps.  Yup, I said it.  It is the ideal yuppie place in the heart of the Financial District, where you have to walk the walk and talk the talk and spend your money like it's going out of style.  But you're spending your cash on amazing meals, delicious wine, appetizers that you won't find anywhere else, fascinating people and atmosphere you can only dream of.  Go ahead and say it, it's pretentious and overpriced.  But experience it first.  I (and my credit card) had a blast. Perhaps it's my quiet yearning to be in Europe again sipping cappuccino while sitting on the side of the road on my backpack, sweaty and tired and absolutely in love with everything around me.  OK, so this isn't exactly that, but you can dream, no?  Oh go ahead, I dare you.  ps:  go there after dark.", "author": "Joanna L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-02", "description": "Belden Place guarantees to put you in a mood parallel to that with most intimate restaurants in Europe. Enjoy cuisine from France (Cafe Bastille, Plouf), Italy (Cafe Tiramisu) and even Spain (B44) in this little hideaway from the city dubbed as the \"French Quarter\" of San Francisco. The area may become crowded especially during warm summer nights when the stars and the bright lights entice more people to try the place.  However, it is a small price to pay for experiencing this small slice of Europe located smack in the heart of the Financial District. If you stumble on it by accident, it's a uniquely appealing discovery!", "author": "Alexander L."}

I would call them \"forward\" not aggressive (amazing how many complainers their are).   I love this place on a warm evening but it is San Francisco & most nights are chilly (bring your jacket).  I had a hard time picking a restaurant based on yelp comments, seems like you either love or hate it.  I've been to Plouf & Cafe Bastille both are great!", "author": "Ed F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-28", "description": "The ambiance is very nice, outdoor dining in an alley - yes, though an alley it is still cute and a wonderful place to linger after a good meal for a (few more    :)     ) glasses of wine after dinner.  I started with the butter leaf salad, substantial without being overwhelming, and then the lamb shank which was done nicely in a deep red/brown wine sauce.  The house cab was just fine - nothing fantastic, but easily good enough.  It was a bit crowded, but their breadstick basket, with other bread crisps of odd variety, kept us nibbling while we waited for service which was understandably a little slow - but not unforgivably so, considering it was a weekend night with a wait just to get a table.  Great place to people watch, to be a little loud if you want.  They have an upstairs inside as well if you want a little more quiet, but really the best reason to go here is for the outdoor seating - the quality of everything else isn't far behind that.", "author": "Sophie B."}
