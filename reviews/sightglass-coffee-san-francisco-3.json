Compared to shops on Divisadero(medium) or 7th street(large), the space here is small size. A lot of people come and go in the morning, so sometimes you have to wait for a seat. Because it's not a large space, crowd is more quiet. \n\nThe lighting, color, furniture, tile, etc.. give you a warm and special feeling and their design theme continues in other stores like the one on Divisadero. Again, I think their coffee and the thought they put in spatial design is on another level :) \n\nStop here to get coffee and then you can head to Tartine Manufactory to grab pastry. (5min walk) Only negative thing is it's difficult to find parking.", "author": "Dee K."}

There's almost always people hanging out inside and on the bench outside with Sightglass drinks. I have yet to try their regular coffees, but the vanilla cold brew was very smooth and refreshing, albeit a bit sweet for my tastes. The mocha is hands-down my favorite drink. The chocolate is bittersweet, so its not overwhelming sweet like the typical mocha's you would get. You can also easily substitute dairy with almond or soy milk as well. Each hot drink is made carefully and with some kind of heart-like latte art too :) Wait time might be a bit longer as they don't rush the process. Condiments and caps are located in a corner at the back of the store. Also they take NFC payments and tap cards.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I've heard about it many times from coffee folks, and have seen their beans served everywhere here in San Diego.

Their coffee is great, and like I said earlier they have their beans for wholesale everywhere in California. It's almost a staple that good coffee is served here if you see Sightglass coffee beans. \n\nNot the biggest shop (I believe the one on 7th street is bigger with two floors), but everything about it screams SF.

At the time, I remember thinking they served high quality coffee in a beautifully designed setting.\n\nAfter lunch one day, I ended up looking for coffee to try to combat the post-lunch slump, and to my delight I saw that there was a Sightglass nearby.  I've been there a few times now, and while I am still a fan of their espresso (usually gotten as an Americano), I am really impressed by their vanilla cold brew.  It comes with milk already added (you can choose whole or almond milk), and I found it had an excellent vanilla flavor without being overly sweet.  The barista advised me that adding almond milk might make it too sweet, so just keep that in mind when you order.  The cafe is also filled with lots of wooden furniture and sunlight, which makes me think it would be a good space to linger and get some work done or have a long chat with a friend.\n\nOne minor downside is that the staff is somewhat aloof, but otherwise, I'll definitely be back for the good brew and the excellent space!", "author": "Keith H."}

Sure, it's more expensive than hitting up Philz or Atlas, but the minor price differential has always seemed worth it for all the loves stated above.\n\nBut a couple of days ago I got a couple of quick cups and a croissant and the damage was $15.50. Granted $2 of that was tip, but that made me do a double-take. It looks like the last time I had a Sightglass quick cup was July 4 - and it was $3.50. Doing some digging online and Thrillest posted an article in Feb 2016 on where to get a great cup of coffee in SF for under $3 and had Sightglass was listed for serving up their quick cups for $2.50. Today it's $4.75 per quick cup and I've having a hard time reconciling the 36% increase from a mere three months ago. Especially considering that a cappuccino is $4.50 and a latte $5, both of which require longer time to prepare and more labor on the side of the staff. $4.75 for pre-prepared batch drip coffee, dispensed from an urn in about 5 seconds makes little sense. \n\nThat all being said, I shared my thoughts directly with sightglass and a manager was very considerate in replying with understanding the original frustration, some thinking behind their decision-making (primarily to support the minimum wage increase in SF, which is certainly warranted), and their goal to keep more accessible (both in price and flavor) coffees available in the quick cup rotation.", "author": "Liz F."}

I asked for the wifi, and surprisingly they don't have free wifi. I was quite shocked. I mean call me cheap and asian, but I'm on a data plan I pay for it like an adult.

Stylish, but limited. If you want to sit down inside, expect to be at a table with someone else.

Maybe a short break to read while sipping coffee, but even that's pushing it with the crowds.\n\nThe pastries are suspiciously similar to the other coffee places. The pistachio scone is my current favorite. My previous favorite was the hazelnut orange cake, which was usually awesome, but was once very bad.\n\nMy favorite thing here is the cappuccino.

Honestly, do yourself a favor and skip overrated Blue Bottle and head straight for Sightglass.\n\nThe 20th St location isn't the famous 7th St location but still a lovely space. Right off of Florida and 20th St, it's in a quiet, yet trendy block of Mission next to American Grilled Cheese Kitchen, Atlas, Central Kitchen, and others. Sightglass is so lovely, with lots of plants, wood, and beautifully showcased pastries.\n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the vanilla cold brew/iced vanilla toddy, which has housemade vanilla syrup- which isn't very sweet actually, but quite vanilla-y, housemade cold brew, and milk of your choice, I really like almond milk. I tend to like quite sweet coffee, but this really hits the spot, even though it's not really very sweet at all. It's just so aromatic and the coffee itself is soooo smooth and not at all acidic, just the way I love my cold brew.\n\nPro-tip: If you get the coffee in-house, they'll give it to you in an adorable mason jar which is much larger than their to-go cup.

What's really cool about this place is that they highlight different beans and roasts then their main location. This adds variety to the mix, so if the 7th street location doesn't meet your fancy there's a good chance this place will. The location is probably 1/10th the size of the main location, but it adds an air of intimacy and definitely allows you to have a better conversation with the baristas/ workers.

I proceed to ask her, \"so are these the different kinds of flavors of coffee you have now?\" She proceeds to explain and is talking pretty quickly again.  So finally I tell her, \" I'm sorry. I didn't understand a word you said. I'm a novice at this and if you can please give me a little more clarification and explanation on what you have.\"  So now she speaks slower and goes more into detail what the different sections of the menu are.  I finally state, \" oh ok so do you also serve ice coffee or ice tea?\"  Finally she peaks my interest on a drink called Vanilla Iced Toddy made with almond milk.  Loved it! \n\nMy advice is for all folks in customer service is never assume who you're customers are and to speak slower than sounding like a machine gun because you want to just get thru explaining your products.
