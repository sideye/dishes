I order with loosely held aspirations (e.g. 4-piece Spicy) but let the fate of the fryer decide my order.  As long as a breast and wing are in the mix, I'm fine with whatever flavors and pieces destiny has chosen for me.\n\n4-Piece: This is why you come here.  There is *no* fast food joint with better fried chicken.  Additionally, many fancy fried chicken restaurants with table service rarely live up to Popeye's.  And if they do happen to be better, they are usually 3x - 5x more expensive!  Something about Popeye's super crispy batter and tender chicken underneath.  If you're lucky enough to have the Spicy pieces be ready when you order, you can really appreciate that extended marinating.\n\nBiscuit: A must for any chicken meal.  Super flaky.  A tad buttery, but not overly so.  Though one is all I really need to satiate me.\n\nRed Beans & Rice: I get so focused on the chicken and biscuits, I often forget about their sides.  But these beans are really good.  So smoky and creamy.  With just a dollop of rice to add some firm texture.", "author": "Adam B."}

There was a pretty long line. I wasn't sure why it wasn't moving fast but paid no attention as there was a tv playing football, and I noticed they didn't run out of chicken, there were plenty at the pass.\n\n10 minutes later, still waiting in line, the lady in front of me is having card issues, and it still trying to figure out her credit card. Not sure if it was some type of fraudulent purchase, but I didn't mind waiting because I was soooo hungry.\n\nFinally their taking my order, and I realize they put a new trainee at the register....why? I also didn't mind, but the manager looked annoyed when he would ask her how to put in the order. It looked like she was busy making post mate orders.\n\nAfter I FINALLY PLACED MY ORDER, I stood to the side, where about 10 people were standing also waiting for their order. I stood there confused. There was a ton of chicken at the pass, and 2 people preparing the boxes. But NOTHING WAS GETTING SENT OUT. I kept seeing fresh chicken being put at the pass but the workers weren't grabbing it to hand out orders. The cooks were doing something right, but the people executing the orders were soooo slowwww. I sat back down because I had a feeling it was going to be awhile.they were just staring at the chicken. I wasn't sure what was going on. I didn't ask but I just wanted to hop over and get my food myself.\n\nAfter waiting another 15 minutes for my order, the new shift employees arrived. But the pace didn't change. A couple of guys came in from post mates and they got their orders first. Granted, they still had to wait 10 minutes, but they still got their food before we did.\n\nAbout another 10 minutes later, we finally got our order. We hungrily ste it and was so disappointed! The chicken was so dry by the time we got it. They weren't moving fast enough to move the product. \n\nDefinitely the worst Popeyes I've ever been to. Not the place to order from.

I ordered from this Popeyes location, through Grubhub, earlier this evening at 7:30pm...and even left a tip on top of the $5 delivery charge upon ordering (which is a practice I'm very much considering no longer doing when ordering delivery because of this experience). I place my order at 7:30pm,  then patiently wait until 8:45pm before contacting the restaurant to inquire about where it is, since it was quoted to reach me within 55 minutes of ordering it. To my surprise, the order hadn't even left the restaurant...and furthermore,  the manager says the driver won't even be around to pick it up until about 9:10pm. They quickly ask if I just want to cancel the order, to which I tell them not to. But when I get off of the phone with them, I contact Grubhub to see if they have any sort of influence on getting more information from the restaurant on how it's taking so long to get my order out of the door. While on the phone with Grubhub customer service, speaking with a representative,  I receive a text on my phone saying that my order has been canceled. Mind you, the restaurant is open until 10pm...so what reason would they have to cancel an order otherwise, especially after told not to. The Grubhub representative calls them to figure out what's taking them nearly two hours to deliver the order...and the manager lies and tells him that I called and told them to cancel it. He even tells them that he's sure I was just calling to find out what the hold up was, and they still refuse to have the order delivered.\nAnd for the cherry on top, this will make the second time in a row that something very similar to this situation has happened to me when ordering delivery from this Popeyes location.\nI place an order\nThe order is received\nThe order is made (?)\nI wait over an hour\nI inquire, just to find out it hasn't even left the premises.\nLast time the business closed before I could inquire about my order.\n\nMoral of the story, if you order delivery from here...you'll spend money to wait over an hour, and still end up starving after waiting...with no food on the way", "author": "U.

The tables and floors have always appeared clean whenever I've visited.  And the chicken is good--juicy and delicious.\n\nBut on two occasions I've ordered 12 chicken thighs--and paid extra for them--and brought home a box of chicken containing LEGS, BREASTS and WINGS!\n\nAdmittedly, you get more meat on a breast than a thigh, but I prefer dark meat to white.  And you get far LESS meat on a leg--and especially on a wing--than you do on a thigh.  On top of that: If you're going to be charged EXTRA for a \"special order,\" then YOU SHOULD GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.\n\nThe second time this happened, I went back the same night (although this meant another lengthy bus ride from my home). The original box had contained: THREE thighs, THREE breasts, THREE legs and THREE wings--NOT TWELVE THIGHS. And I brought its evidence with me, along with the slip of my order.\n\nNot getting what I had paid for was bad enough. But what REALLY infuriated me was the reaction of the store manager.  According to  him, it ISN'T enough to clearly give your order to the cashier who is supposed to write it up.  Apparently, to make sure they get it right, you need to give it TO AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON there.  \n\nHe didn't say just WHICH person you're supposed to give it to.\n\nIn short: If YOU CLEARLY TELL the cashier WHAT YOU WANT, it's YOUR FAULT WHEN THEY REPEATEDLY GIVE YOU WHAT YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR.\n\nThis ISN'T how a successful business is supposed to run.  And when CUSTOMERS are blamed for the CARELESSNESS of employees, word gets around.

Usually when I pass by, there's no sign of life, except when they have advertised a special.  Reading some older reviews here, apparently this site was remodeled in the recent past.  I can only imagine what it use to look like...\n\nThe inside is basic, the atmosphere, tables, seating are bare bones and uninviting, not particularly comfortable or beckoning--if that's what they were goin' for, to accelerate turnover, they succeeded. When it is busy, a line forms down the center, from the counter to the front door, which makes for chaos for those already seated and those waiting on their order. Clearly no one gave much thought to customer flow in the remodel, or didn't care. If they hired an interior designer for the remodel, that person should be shown the door.\n\nNot to invoke a stereotype, but the employees are \"fast food\", they are there to do a mechanical task, they lend nothing positive to the experience. The register experience is underwhelming, whether or not to charge for a bag seems to dominate the limited exchange.  Homeless population has an impact here.\n\nI like the chicken, but it's overpriced except when they have a promotion.  There's nothing about this physical location or the employees, however, that make me want to return, except when I get a craving for that chicken, which is becoming less and less...\n\nWhoever has this franchise location, I doubt it's goin' add much to their retirement.", "author": "Steve M."}

The batter on the outside of the chicken was pretty awesome - very crispy with a slight spice, but not too spicy.

I've had my share of gourmet fried chicken and grew up on the Colonel's own special blend, but I'm starting to believe in Popeyes and their mighty tasty, mighty spiced variety. So crisp, yet so tender. What can I say, I'm a flavor seeker. \n\nI know it's not good for me, just like booze and Law & Order marathons, but sometimes you have to give into vice. Sometimes the good die young. What am I even talking about?\n\nThis location in particular (actually the only one I've been into) always beckons to me, especially when I'm carousing over at NOPA across the street. Especially after 5 or more drinks. \n\nIf you're with company, go for the bucket. In any case, you can specifically ask for drumsticks, which amongst the fried chicken set, is golden. Get some mac 'n' cheese or mashed potatoes for a side. \n\nA quick note about the Popeyes biscuit: it's heaven sent. Eat it plain, dip it, or if you're feeling ambitious, break up pieces of your chicken and make a mini sandwich. \n\nI'll end with some fun trivia: The founder of this wonderful Louisiana-based chain has claimed that he named the establishment after the Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in The French Connection (not the sailor of the same name); he also wouldn't confirm or deny that he was too poor to afford an apostrophe. I like stories like this, but now must  go and eat some fried chicken.\n\nOh one more tip: If you're feeling embarrassed about going, tell people that you're fine dining at this new Southern-Latin fusion joint pronounced \"Poe-pee-yes.\"", "author": "Nish N."}

After noticing that Popeye's has received a total of three and a half stars, I know it is ok to confess my here-to-now secret love for Popeye's fried chicken.  \n\nBack when I lived in this neighborhood I'd occasionally sneak out of my apartment cloak and dagger style to pick up some delicious Popeye's Fried Chicken.  I don't know why I was so ashamed to admit that I loved Popeye's - maybe it was the artery-clogging, weight-gaining, fried-food nature of the food; or maybe it was the nation-wide chain aspect of it; or maybe I just liked having a secret food obsession.  Whatever it was... I felt the need to be totally secret about my enjoyment of the Popeye's fried chicken (I personally prefer the all white meat chicken strips with two potato-based side dishes).  \n\nPicture this:\n\nIt is May in the year 2003.  It is the dead of the night (i.e. 6:00 or 7:00 p.m.).  Matthew H. is sitting in his living room playing Metal Gear with his roommates.  Somewhere, deep in my sub-cockels I can feel the familiar stir of a Popeye's craving bubbling up through the depths of my being.  \n\nTrying to remain casual so as to not alert my roommates to my dark-obsession, I stand up and stretch my arms.  A quick counter-clockwise head-roll, and then I fake a yawn.\n\nMe:  \"Hmmmm, I sure could use a cup of coffee.  I'm feeling pretty tired.  I think I'll go get a cup of coffee at Cafe Abir guys.  I'll be right back.\"\n\nRoommate J to me: \"Yeah.  Ok.  Whatever.\"\n\nRoommate C to roommate J: \"Dude, if you make Solid Snake smoke a cigarette you can see the red lasers and crawl under them to avoid detection by the guards.\"\n\nWith my roommates satisfactorily obsessed with their videogame, I know now is my time.  Rushing to my room, I throw on a large, unmarked hoodie, a baseball cap, and grab my backpack.  With this outfit I suspect I look generic enough to go unnoticed on my way to Popeye's.  \n\nSo as to avoid unwanted suspicion from my roommates if they were to have watched out the window - I walk away from Popeye's in the direction of Cafe Abir, and then double-back once I hit Divisadero.  Walking slowly and away from the street I try to remain casual.  Head down, hands in pockets - I make eye-contact with no one.  \n\nI wander into Popeye's and quickly, look over both shoulders.  The coast is clear.   I was not detected.  \n\nMe to Popeye's counter person:  \"Breast strips with a side of mashed potatos and a side of potato wedges.\"  \n\nWhen my order is ready, I reach deep into my pocket and produce correct change to cover my meal.  Quickly dropping the money on the counter, I open my backpack and put the Popeye's bag in.  \n\nI sprint home, and quickly rush to my bedroom.  Only nano-seconds later, like a lean and hungry wolf, I devour my chicken and potato feast.  Scraps of breading are flying everywhere, gravy drips on my sweatshirt, deep gutteral gasps for air slip out in between bites.  \n\nThen there is a knock on the door: \n\nRoommate J: \"Matthew, are you in there?  What is all that noise?  Are you ok?\"\n\nMe:  \"Nyum nyum.... everything.. nyum... is... nyum nyum... fine!!!  Go away!!!\"\n\nRoommate J: \"Dude, are you sure?  The worst noises are coming out of there?  I'm coming in.\"\n\nMe: \"DUDE!!!!  nyum... nyum... NO!!!\"\n\nBut it is too late.  He has opened the door.  Staring at me in a way that can only be described as either a) pure horror or b) utter indifference, my roomate says to me, \"Dude, should have told me you were getting Popeye's.  I would have gone with you.  By the way, you should really chew with your mouth closed.  That is kinda gross.\"", "author": "Matthew H."}

I got barked at that it doesn't have a biscuit included by the older Asian lady, and the younger one made a mistake. No attempt to trade the cole slaw or apologize for the misinformation. I'm told I can't now buy a biscuit unless I buy 4 so I spend another 5 bucks. I then realize I never got my root beer either and ask for it. The old asian lady says I have to be able to prove that and there is no way to prove it. I point at the dozens are video cameras. I'm told they wouldn't be checking. I frown, but then the ditsy misinforming young Asian girl looks at the on the employee side of the soda fountain and says oh shit,  and there was a root beer filled but not given out and she proceeds to pour some out to add ice, even though I said no ice. I hate ice. I ask for no ice and am given this look of we're doing you a favor by giving it to you after you walked out without it after we didn't give it to you and am told they don't do that.

Don't get me wrong, we never ate here all the time (not all of us at least), but this is probably the best fried chicken meal you can get for under $5...it is a killer in terms of fat, cholesterol, and calories, but who's counting?", "author": "Andy P."}

I started eating here and have never returned to KFC-Taco Bell-Pizza hut for their pizza or chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-11", "description": "The only day you should ever come here is Tuesday, and the only thing you should ever order is the 99 cent Tuesday special. Where else can you pay only $1.08 to get two beautifully fried pieces of chicken (leg and thigh)? They're quite nice about it, too. In fact, when I order my two-piece special, they usually ask me, \"How many?\" Yes, they will actually allow you to order ten two-piece specials for yourself in one order without an argument. There's little better than this in life. It makes for a great day of passing out on the couch with a stack of empty Popeye's fried chicken boxes next to you.", "author": "Michael G."}

All the chicken has the extra-crispy batter with a choice of mild or spicy (mild, please.) I love the strips, the cajun fries and LOTS OF BISCUITS. They're a but denser than KFC's and topped with butter, oh my. They also have shrimp and fish (I think) but the area is a little sketchy... what the hell, all the areas are sketchy but well worth going to. The food is so delicious my family will drive 15+ miles for it (fast-food chicken!)", "author": "Alden C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-02", "description": "Popeye's is Cajun fastfood and it doesn't really have any competition in that department in SF. I can't compare the chicken well to KFC because it's a totally different style. Crispier, spicier, not as juicy but good for what it is. I actually think the best things to get here are the biscuits and sides like Jambalaya and Reb Beans and Rice. Some Popeyes do more seafood like catfish poboys and popcorn shrimp that are pretty good too, but I haven't seen it at this location. \n\nBasically this place serves as the only real late night restaurant in this area, it's pretty much the last place to close so if it's near midnight and you're on Divis, this may be your only choice besides a market.", "author": "Martin C."}
