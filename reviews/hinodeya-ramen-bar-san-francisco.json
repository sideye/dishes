Having been wandering around Japantown with 5% battery life remaining on my cell phone and minimal access to wifi, I saw that there were a few people lined up at the door so opted to eat here for lunch. Only later did I realize that Hinodeya has a well established, multigenerational history of ramen making success.\n\nAs a single diner I was seated right away at the bar. I appreciated that they have hooks where I could hang my purse and shopping bags. The restaurant itself is fairly sizeable with some larger tables that seat up to 8 people and some private booths towards the back of the restaurant. \n\nI ordered the house ramen ($14) which came within 10 minutes of me ordering it. The dashi broth was clear, nicely seasoned and light without the heavy handed saltiness, a nice change from many of the heavier broths I'm accustomed to finding at most other ramen places. The noodles were freshly made and thicker and maintained a nice chew throughout my meal. The finely chopped scallions and menma which I would normally eat around actually helped elevate the overall flavour and texture profile of the delicate broth. Two generously sized pieces of chashu came with the ramen and these were flavourful and not too fatty. The soft boiled egg helped add a bit of richness to the meal. \n\nOn the merit of the ramen itself I would return when in the area. But what I really appreciated was that when I asked if by chance there was a cell phone charger available to charge my depleted battery, my server didn't miss a beat and offered to plug it in near the cash register. It felt somewhat strange not having my phone to take pictures of my food when it first arrived, but that short charging session allowed me to enjoy my meal without the distraction of technology and allowed me to carry on my food adventures in the area with sufficient charge to make it back to my hotel.", "author": "Arlene B."}

Soup was piping hot!  The critical first step to ramen greatness.   Yup, 10 clams just like in the picture.  Honest menu.  Tasty broth and the clams not over cooked.  Some sliced negi onions and mizuna for freshness.  Gyoza give it a B.  Could have caramelized it a bit more.  I like crunchy.  Great side of fatty char siu.   All about the pork belly.   A little hot sake and I am now I will be a repeat customer. \n\nThe finale is a little bingo kind of game for small prizes.  Just for fun but all the customers get a kick out of it.  1st prize is a bowl of ramen.  \n\nYuppp.  I worked in Japan.  This place is pretty legit!  Give it a try!", "author": "David W."}

It can get overwhelming to eat out when some menus are vast and there are too many options to choose from. They have 3 main ramen entrees, so you know they've worked hard to pare down the ingredients and choose the best combinations to make their ramen delicious.\n\nThe house ramen and vegan ramen are quite good. Salty and thick in all the right places. The yams were incredibly delicious as well.\n\nThe restaurant is also baby-friendly and service-dog friendly. There's enough background noise that if you're eating here and an infant starts crying, customers around you don't really notice because of the humming of activity that's already happening. \n\nThis place is small, but I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes.

So take this review with a grain of salt, because the ramen I typically eat raises your blood pressure by 200% and puts you on Lipitor for 6 months.\n\nFirst of all, line wasn't that bad but the service was really slow. I think since we came towards the end of the lunch hour the staff was starting to wind down (they were sort of just huddled in the corner on their phones), and weren't paying attention to us at all. It was a bit annoying for sure but probably our fault for coming so late (around 2pm).\n\nAnyways, we ordered the house ramen and the chicken ramen. The house broth was super light, but had a pretty nice flavor--definitely not bland. The chicken broth had a bit more depth to it as expected but wasn't rich or fatty by any means. Both broths had an amazing initial flavor, and the meat was very good.\n\nMy issue with this style of ramen is that the tongue very quickly acclimates to the light flavor and it gets boring 1/3 into the bowl. I did try using the extra flavors they offer as add-ins, but it didn't complement the overall flavor (just masked). Although the initial flavor was amazing, the excitement just wore off too quickly.\n\nOverall, I did not get the \"umph, ahhhh\" that I desire at the end of every ramen meal, but definitely praise this restaurant for succeeding at delivering a unique, interesting, and delicious flavor.", "author": "Nova W."}

I really appreciated this because I prefer having more meat than anything. \n\nIf I came on an empty stomach (which unfortunately I did not), I'd have finished my bowl without any discomfort...I still finished it - too good to stop eating - but I was so FULL. \n\nThe service was great. Waiters ninja'd their way to refilling our water glasses whenever they were empty. Barely even noticed them. And the check came with a paper crane and a sticker.

It was both rich and flavourful and I was thoroughly impressed... didn't know vegetables could pack such flavour!

Ramen is at its peak when its either creamy to the point where it resembles your boss' half and half, or when it's as transparent as a pond. We ordered the Hinodeya classic dashi ramen. The meal was immaculate. So good. Would come back here and camp out on the streets for this ramen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "This ramen shop is pretty A-OK though it has its high points. We came by on a Sunday at 6 and had almost no wait for a party of two, although it was busy the entire time and there were periods where there was a line.\n\nFirst off, we ordered the Takowasa ($5) as an appetizer. It had a very good wasabi taste and was spicy but not overpowering. Most of the pieces were tender, although a small percentage was too chewy. That's octopus for you though, so this dish was a success.\n\nThen, the ramen. Overall it was fine but a little uneven. I ordered the Hamaguri Ramen (Limited Clam Ramen, $18). The clams were really good and generous, and props for being very clean meaning no residual grit or shell pieces floating around. But it had literally no other toppings beyond the bare minimum (seaweed and some onions.) The broth was light and clear, but flavorful. The noodles though sadly, needed help. I appreciate that they were whole wheat, but the consistency was odd and they didn't have the \"spring\" that ramen should have...it honestly felt and tasted more like packaged udon. \n\nThe other bowl we got was the Hinodeya Ramen ($14), because we might as well order the house ramen. This one was more like a classic ramen, with pork chashu, bamboo, and a soft boiled egg. Like the clam ramen, the toppings were good and in this case more plentiful. But they used the same (or similar) broth, which didn't quite work as well for a classic pork ramen as it did for the seafood one...it was too light and a bit fishy to stand up to the chashu. The noodles were the same with the same issues too.\n\nThey did have interesting condiments. One jar had an \"umami paste\" made with bonito and scallop powder, and another had crispy onions and garlic in chili oil. They did help add more depth to the broth, esp. for the Hinodeya Ramen.\n\nOverall it gets about 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it down to three because it's a tad overpriced. I'd come back though and could see this place being really good if they tighten up their noodles and make some of their touches a bit less awkward (i.e. make a more meat-friendly blend of broth for the Hinodeya Ramen, use a less messy part of the chicken than the wing for the tori paitan ramen.)", "author": "David A."}

Like clear, rich, chicken broth. It was not salty, you could taste that someone spent time on it. The noodles were cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of chewy. The ramen also comes with half an egg, chashu, and bamboo shoots. \n\nHave to gripe about the egg. It had no flavor and didn't really add anything to the dish. Chashu was yummy. Bamboo shoots were well flavored. \n\nWe also ordered the stewed chicken wings as a starter with our beer. They have Asahi on tap here. The wings were flavorful but meh. I only say meh bc of the texture. They were fall off the bone and had great flavor, but the texture was mushy.

The atmosphere is very warming and elegant as I welcomed there. The concept is very modern and contemporary with the original Japanese heritage twist where exotic wooden chandeliers hanging on the ceiling and warm ambiance of interior lights illuminates the visitors/\n\nThe employees here from servers and cookers are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a remarkable and exquisite service! No cons!\n\nNow onto the food! On 2/24/2018 before the doors opened, I ordered the original house ramen noodle soup aka. the Hinodeya Ramen. It contains the original Japanese made dashi soup with whole wheat ramen noodles, two chashu pork, menma (bamboo shoots), soft cooked boiled egg (half cut), a dried seasoned seaweed, green onions, red pepper sliced garnish & sprinkled with sesame seeds. As I ate it, that ramen tasted flawless and  convincing! Perfectly fresh and bold than any ramen noodles elsewhere! The broth was very rich and flavorful which I did felt the dashi taste! The noodles were prepared and boiled for perfection which I can bite the noodles easily. The rest of the toppings in this soup were magnificent and naturally delicious. From chashu pork to garnishes, everything here was wonderful all thanks to the balance of seasonings and sauces. Overall, a great ramen meal for lunch break!\n\nParking at Hinodeya Ramen Bar can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Hinodeya Ramen Bar is the finest and the most outstanding Japanese ramen restaurant that I've ever visited.

I hadn't been to Japantown for ramen since before both places opened, so I was looking forward to comparing them to my already favorites, Yamadaya and Waraku.\n\nAlthough the house ramen may seem like the signature, I actually think the tori paitan is the star at Hinodeya. The broth is thick and rich, full of chicken flavor. And what I love about Hinodeya is the two kinds of \"salts\" they have on the side for you to add to your ramen. I like the garlic chili one. You're going to add a lot, because in the beginning, you're not going to taste it. But as you get down more into the broth, the chili will start revealing itself. The flavor slowly changes with more garlic and chili flavor. I really enjoyed that progression of flavors. Highly recommend!", "author": "Sherry L."}

Waitresses were running back and forth, but no one even acknowledged my presence. Once seated, though, I felt very rushed. Barely giving me any time to look over the menu, the waitress who could care less about seating me earlier, suddenly wanted to immediately take my order (probably because they were close to closing). Throughout my lunch, she was polite, but not at all helpful. Never once refilled my water glass, even though it had been clearly empty during most of my time there. Felt like I was inside a typical Chinatown establishment.\n\nSanitation:  I noticed their 79 Health Inspection Score. That translates to a letter grade of \"C\". Not good; not for something you're actually eating! When I was in the restaurant, I saw how they slacked in this area...The restroom was filthy and they were out of seat covers and barely any toilet paper was left, let alone the filthy floor. If they're not cleaning their public restroom, I'm sure they're not cleaning much in the kitchen, an area we won't even see.\n\nAlso, they were seating customers at the bar. However, I chose not to be seated there because I saw a multi-level racks stored there with kitchen items. Why are they storing something like that in the public dining area, which should be  clearly stored in the kitchen? That entire section behind the bar seemed very cluttered, including another rack of cleaning items and multiple garbage cans (see photo). They're probably having an outflow of clutter in the bar because the kitchen is overwhelmed with clutter!\n\nFood:  Got the Hinodeya ramen, which I enjoyed because of the noodles itself. For me, ramen is  made squiggly and al dente, as they've accomplished. I also prefer their light dashi broth compared to  other rich, heavy broths common to most ramen joints.  However, the broth came out just lukewarm. Broth should be pipping hot!\n\nOverall, it's unfortunate, because this restaurant could be so much more, if they just focused on the basics when it comes to cleanliness and service.", "author": "Lori N."}

Firstly, the broth is clear but VERY rich and flavorful. It was a perfectly balance of umami without being overly salty or watery. It felt very light and enjoyable with the noodles. The noodles were unique in that the texture was different than your typical packaged ramen. The thin noodles had some edge to it so it was chewy and light. The chasu was soft and tender. The egg was cooked to a perfect soft boil and a subtle marination. The bamboo shoots were amazing. It had a good crunch and marinated well. They also have a dessert menu which looks really interesting if you like matcha! \n\nThe only thing I could think of that could use improvement are the prices. $14-$16 per bowl of ramen is a bit steep.

The dashi broth is light in taste, but not bland. Their noodles have a nice chew to it. If you read the yelp reviews, the Tori Paitan gets a huge following but I can honestly say, that Mensho's Tori Paitan is TOPS. \n\nHinodeya Ramen ($14) has whole wheat noodles, chasu pork (too fatty), menma, perfect soft egg and other toppings. My husband liked the Shoyu veggie ramen ($15) and it looked so amazing! with the acorn squash and kale, it's a great departure from the usual. My friend liked her vegan ramen as well. \n\nIf you come with a large group, get the flame torched pork belly! It was melt in your mouth delish. I found the kaarage too bland so use the matcha salt it came with. \n\nService is really friendly and for a group of 7, we only waited 20 minutes.

I had bookmarked a few places on Yelp that offered a vegetarian/vegan ramen option, and Hinodeya was one of them. While walking to Benkyodo to buy fresh mochi, we passed by Hinodeya and decided to give it a try. We went in at 2:15 (closing time is 2:30) and they were more than happy to serve us.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was clean and modern looking. Service was great - both our servers were friendly, polite, and efficient. The servers and chefs greeted and said goodbye to us in Japanese. There were 3 types of ramen. I went with the zen ramen (their vegetarian/vegan option), while my mom went with the Hinodeya (house) ramen. \n\nThe zen ramen ($15) came with a light both, shiitake mushroom, fried kale, carrot, dried seaweed, and goji berries. Presentation was beautiful. The ramen noodles were nice and chewy, with a bit of pull. The mushroom was huge and soaked up a lot of flavor. The fried kale was also very flavorful, but it was extremely, extremely oily. You could squeeze a whole tablespoon of oil out of 1 piece of kale. I wish they would have drained it a bit before tossing it into the ramen. That was probably my only issue with the dish because overall, it was a well-composed bowl of vegan ramen. \n\nPortion size was pretty small, considering the bowl was $15, which is more expensive than a lot of other ramen places.

After my awesome meals at Mensho, Nojo Ramen Tavern, and nearby Marufuku Ramen, I couldn't help but think that the party would keep going here.  Between their successful location in Tokyo, as well their founder's legit resume, Hinodeya has some serious street (ramen?) cred to their name!  Which, sadly, only makes this all the more disappointing...\n\nLocated on the cobblestone-ish street across from the Peace Plaza in Japantown, Hinodeya sits in Sushi Aka Tombo's old space...and right across from two other ramen joints - Yamadaya  (pretty solid) and Tanpopo (not nearly as good as it used to be, despite my now outdated 5-star review).  By comparison though, Hinodeya is a bit more interesting.  Not only did they do a nice job of renovating the space, but their selection of dashi ramens (albeit limited) are rather appealing.\n\n-- KARAAGE - Fried Juicy Boneless, Cage-Free Organic Chicken...$8\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hinodeya-ramen-bar-san-francisco?select=fYY5jivsxAkoXR8gswrTEw)\nI know it's all about the ramen here, but even still...this was super disappointing.  While each piece had just the right amount of batter to it, in addition to being well cooked, the chicken was super bland.  An aioli would've helped, but even just more seasoning (probably) would've done the trick.  Pass.\n\n-- HINODEYA RAMEN with Traditional Japanese Dashi-Style Soup & Whole Wheat Noodles, Chashu Pork, Menma, Soft Cooked Marinated Egg, Dried Seaweed, and Green Onion...$14\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hinodeya-ramen-bar-san-francisco?select=BxE2d1mRw-dNqtGAmJU5uw)\nAt a glance, this looked great.  The chashu was tender and just slightly fatty, the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly, and the noodles were fine.  At the same time, the bowl left me wanting; the portion felt a little light and the broth was more oily than flavorful.  Definitely had more than my fill of green onions and menma though, thanks to the overwhelming amount they threw in...\n\nGiven how I usually opt for tonkotsu soup bases, it wouldn't be entirely fair to directly compare Hinodeya and their dashi broth to some of my favorite spots.  However, it certainly wouldn't be unreasonable to say Hinodeya's ramen missed the mark for me.  Toss in how there's usually a wait (only about 20 mins or so, but still) and I really don't have much of a reason to come back.  If I'm going to stand around, or even be around Japantown for ramen, I might as well hit up the amazing Marufuku nearby or the likes of Waraku and Yamadaya for something quick.\n\nTWO AND A HALF STARS rounded up.", "author": "Mike L."}

We got seated in a little area blocked a bit by little clothes, providing minimal privacy (which you don't really expect in a ramen shop).  This place doesn't take reservations so you will have to be ok standing outside (sometimes in the cold) to eat here; we waited maybe 15-20 min on a weekday night at 8pm.  B/c this place is popular, service is on the quicker side but not to the point you feel rushed; in fact, we were able to casually enjoy our meal, which came out quickly and efficiently.\n\nFood: the best way I can describe the food is light and yet rich and flavorful.  Somehow felt different from all other ramen places (which would leave you super heavy and such). Price overall seemed reasonable too, especially given the portion size of the items.\n\n-- Edamame (izakaya snap peas snack)($4) - simple, lightly salted, not too watery and not overcooked.  \n\n-- Oysters Fried (from Hiroshima Japan)($9) - wish all fried oysters could be like this.  The oyster inside was still soft and juicy and had a great briny, sweet taste without being too oily.  The crispy panko shell was also not super thick and goupy but fine and thin, so that you can still taste the oyster inside.\n\n-- Hinodeya Ramen (House Ramen)(traditional Japanese dashi style soup & whole wheat noodles soup made from bonito,kombu & scallop.\ntoppings: chashu pork,menma, soft cooked marinade egg,dried seaweed & green onion)($14) - I ordered this with extra menma (+$2).  The ramen noodle is different than expected- thinner and flatter, in a way that reminded me of slightly chewier and wavier Inaniwa udon.  I personally liked how the chashu pork was on the meatier side so it's not fatty (which I'm not a fan of) and added a bit more richness to the bowl.  My oh my is that broth amazing!

A lot of times, good restaurants are so caught up with the long line of customers that they start to skimp the details of their food. Not at Hinodeya.\n\nI had ramen from Tokyo to Kyoto and l can say Hinodeya ramen is comparable to ones I had in Japan. \n\nFirst, close your eyes. Take a sip of the Hinodeya broth and you automatically noticed the dimensions of this clear broth. It is so deceiving because it looks clear yet possessed a depth of flavor.\n\nOpen your eyes, look at the details of each ingredient and ask yourself why it belongs to this bowl of ramen. The green onions were diced sideways which looks visually better. The menma was different, it was high quality. The chashu pork was perfectly slow cooked, it had the right balance of fat and meat, and still retained the flavor of the seasoning. Lastly, take a second and appreciate the soft cooked egg on how it absorbed the marinade with the almost runny yolk instilled in front of your eyes. Wait, is that red stuff the mighty expensive saffron?!!! At this point, I don't even know what to think. \n\nI suppose it's time for me to slurp the noodles while I follow up with my spoon of broth. It met my expectations, probably exceeded it. Suddenly the subtle flavor of the sesame lifts the noodles a tiny bit. The noodles were perfectly cooked and drained properly. If you noticed, their noodles were different than other ramen places like they put thought in selectively import the perfect type of noodle to go with their ramen. I begin to lose all self control and couldn't stop eating. \n\nFor a short period of time, I fell in love. It's like a cute girl giving you attention. Like accidentally touching your hand, or was it an accident? I'm head over heels now.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Besides ramen they do offer the Dashi Curry. We ended up ordering both ramen specialties. \n\n\"Hinodeya Ramen\" ($14). This is considered their House Ramen. On top of the whole wheat noodles is pork, bamboo shoots and a soft egg. \"Tori Paitan\" ($15). First off, this chicken ramenbowl was just a dollar more. I was disappointed for the two tiny pieces of braised chicken wings, that small add-on looked really sad to me. Also, in the soup is the shitake mushrooms. \n\nI did like their Dashi broth on both bowls, it's like having miso soup, so it was solid. It wasn't too salty and it does have a mild flavor unless seasonings are added to it. However, the seaweed that sits on the wall of the bowl gives it a fish taste. My overall take on their ramen bowls is that the soup and noodles are good, but It felt like there wasn't much from the small portions served, It's almost like having a large side item order. I wish they could've put in a little more into it, so I can be satisfied in what I've paid for. \n\nWe did get friendly service, and our wait time for seating didn't take long.

Upon walking in, I noticed that most of the tables were taken and, since I was dining alone, there were ample counter seats which is where I landed.  After parking my bags under my seat, I studied their one page menu of lunch offerings.  Scanning around the other tables was no help as most diners were either done or didn't have food yet.  As a result, here's what I tried: \n\nAppetizer\n1) Hinodeya salad, half portion (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hinodeya-ramen-bar-san-francisco?select=Xer2gSgt6majzjRYecr2zA) - This was a welcome surprise as I didn't expect a salad that was colorful, ingredient and flavor packed too.  There were small pumpkin pieces too.

The broth was clear and hearty, but not overly rich.  The wings, well.....  the meat just falls right off the bone on a touch.  Liked the egg, semi runny, and the crunch from the nori.\n\nService was efficient but not particularly warm.  As more diners arrived, I gathered my pre shopping wares and placed them under my seat.  My water glass was refilled and dirty plates removed when needed.  The lunch scene seems, from reading other reviews, less hectic than dinner and weekend times.  \n\nThere was a lunch special rice dish that pulled my strings to order, but, being a ramen place, I stayed the course.

(BTW, I see reviews that say TonkAtsu which is a fried, Panko breaded pork cutlet.)\n\nThe soup base is more close to the roots of traditional Japanese cuisine using dried Katsuo/bonito based soup stock for a deep sea meaty yet clear & Assari/refreshingly simple purity. This is what distinguishes Hinodeya from the Kyu-shu- based Tonkotsu Ra-menya. \n\nThe cha-shu- here is less spiced w/ hakkaku/star anise or Sansho no Mi/Japanese pepper as well as being more lean and seasoned mostly w/ Sho-yu/soy sauce. \nAddition of Memma/Sho-yu braised bamboo shoot; chopped green onion to add a sulphurous funk; sprinkling of toasty, nutty Goma/sesame seeds; half egg that has a creamy, thick, gooey orange-yellow yolk. \n\nThe Ra-men noodle has Koshi/springiness & Hagotae/al dente. Miraculously this \"hybrid\" noodle doesn't get mushy for a long time in the Dashi/soup broth. \n\nCondiments: red chile pepper, toasted garlic; Umami filled paste of dried Iwashi/sardines.  \n\nService is energetic w/ Irasshai or welcome greeting & a hearty farewell.

You're probably thinking, \"How can chicken be TOO tender?!\" but it was at a point where even the bones were crumbling and I was getting bone shards in my soup. The wings were also bland, as if they just stuck it in a pressure cooker for too long and forgot about it. The only thing I really liked was the mushroom in the Tori Paitan. \n\nMy main gripe was the wait and price. I came for dinner one night and the line was long. Standing outside in the cold for a tiny $15 bowl of mediocre ramen? No thanks. There are better ramen shops out there that give you more bang for your buck. If I had to come back, I'd skip the ramen and probably try some appetizers--they sounded pretty good on the menu.", "author": "Katherine C."}

Hinodeya Ramen Bar feels like a warm hug from a good friend that you haven't had in awhile. A total recommend & a great place to try if you're in the mood for some bomb ramen!\n\nHinodeya Ramen- ($14). You know that scene in Ratatoille where the food critic eats the Ratatoille & he gets transported back to the time when he was a kid & then devours the rest of the Ratatoille? Their House Ramen gives me similar -hit the home, very comforting feels. LOL\n\nThe sensation I've had with their ramen felt like they were giving me a gentle warm hug from within. The warm but light broth paired with their delicious house noodles was really warm & comforting combo. It definitely wasn't something I was exepcting, so I was surprised at how pleasantly surprised I was when I tried it out. Mmmmmm. Their egg was also cooked perfectly and their side of Chasew? HEAVENLYYY. I'd recommend it for sure.\n\nCurry Special (15$)-  Apparently only available on weekdays, their curry was very earthy, and it wasn't something I normally expect from traditional style Japanese Curry. It came on a LONG plate with their salad and fried potato balls (I forgot what they're called, sorry eep), as well as their rice. Definitely very good, however it wasn't as memorable as their ramen to me. But still a nice option to have if you're here on a week day craving something besides ramen. It's also perfect to share!\n\nThe waiters here are also very attentive and kind, frequently asking if I needed anything despite the fact they seem kinda busy. Also is kinda entertaining hearing them yell Japanese phrases here and there, though it's not bothersome to the atmosphere of the restaurant.\n\nOverall I'd give Hinodeya Ramen Bar a very solid 4 going to a 5. Definitely worth checking out, and I was blown away. The only reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars is because I really wish they had more variety, but for what they have, it's pretty solid ramen.

The chicken was quite firm and while not dry, was not moist either. The matcha salt was disappointingly un-matcha-y. The chicken was crunchy with an appropriate amount of batter, but I think I prefer the chicken at Roka Akor.\n\nThe noodles were very al dente which was kind of nice. They're known for their dashi broth here, which is made from a combination of bonito, anchovy, and scallop. Good seafood flavor without being fishy at all. The half egg was okay but could be less well done. I think I preferred the egg at Marafuku Ramen a bit more. The cha siu pork was cut thick, but a bit lacking in cha siu flavor. The portion size was definitely on the small side given that I could have finished the entire bowl in one sitting. The broth was definitely less heavy / warm than a tonkotsu broth, which was perfect for summer. As good as Marafuku, though in a different way.\n\nThe condiments on the table were fairly tasty. The tabera was a mixture of crunchy garlicky yum. They also provided umami paste, which was a more potent version of the dashi broth.\n\nInterior was modern casual.

Once the food is served, there is a long list of rules to prevent contamination (reserving leftover communal rice/bread). You're not suppose to give another table a plate served in error even if it was untouched (although I've seen this done often enough to know it occurs frequently). So the tall male, non-spectacled server eating the leftover food, while not for contamination reasons, is a no-no. We alerted a waitress, asked for the manager (he was out but wife was there) and gave her a quiet account of what we saw. She gave us an apology but was not concerned enough to ask who it was until we offered it to her.

I liked that it came out hot and not super wet.\n\nAGE-DASHI FRIED TOFU- covered in dashi sauce, topped with grated daikon radish, and bonito flakes\nThe flavors in this dish was very light, but the tofu was cooked perfectly. I wouldn't really say it was fried, but it had a really mushy consistency and only a slight crisp skin. The bonito flakes added a nice saltiness to the dish. Overall, this dish was sweet and light.\n\nOYSTERS FRIED\nI'm not a huge fan of fried oysters, but these were really fresh and good. I like the crispy batter. It wasn't oily and the oysters were flavorful.\n\nKARA-AGE- fried boneless cage free organic chicken\nThis is the best fried chicken I've ever ordered from a japanese restaurant. It was so moist and I love the matcha salt that they provide. The skin was crisp and the inside was juicy. Definitely one of my favorites.\n\nHOTATE SMALL RICE BOWL- with traditional dashi taste steamed rice and dried scallops made with tamanishiki rice\nThis is a very simple dish. I could definitely taste the salted scallops. For its simplicity, it was still good and filling, but just a bit dry.\n\nHINODEYA RAMEN- house ramen with traditional japanese dashi style soup and whole wheat noodles soup made from bonito, kombu, and scallop, topped with chashu pork, menma, soft cooked marinade egg, dried seaweed, and green onion\nThe broth is very light and simple. The noodles were cooked perfectly and were soft, but also had a slight firmness. The pork was very fatty and the egg wasn't as runny as I would've liked and they only give half an egg. The ramen tasted fresh, but in terms of flavors, it was just too light for me.\n\nKURO-GOMA ICE CREAM W/GRANOLA\nI absolutely loved the black sesame ice cream. It was so good and the granola went perfect with it because it was crunchy and the ice cream was cold and smooth. The whipped cream was like the icing on the cake because it just added another layer of sweetness, which was perfect because the ice cream was rich in black sesame flavor and not overly sweet.\n\nThey have fried garlic at the table and it's the best thing ever! It made everything taste even better. My sister and I finished the whole jar! It had a nice chili and garlic-y flavor. \n\nMy sister and I left on full stomachs. I was satisfied. I would come back here, but I wouldn't order the same ramen, but I definitely would get the small dishes.", "author": "Anh L."}

With that said, I refused to wait last time but had every intent on returning to try their infamous dashi ramen!  Hinodeya definitely set themselves apart from many other ramen joints.\n\nBefore they opened, my honey and I could hear the staff doing some motivational chanting in Japanese prior to opening for business for the day.  As patrons entered, we were enthusiastically greeted.  The atmosphere is lively, pleasant and fun.  The modern, minimalistic decor with dark browns and those fancy chandeliers with glossy branches and Edison bulbs dangling are quite chic.  The food and service is also on point.\n\nBoth of us ordered the Hamaguri (clam) ramen.  We really enjoyed the clear, flavorful, buttery broth as opposed to the usual thick oily types.  I added shitake mushroom and chashu pork.  The shitake mushrooms were soft and flavorful and tasted like they'd done more to them than throw them in the soup.  The chashu pork was pliable and juicy- far from dry and tasty!  They had condiments on the table I'd never seen before:  Unami oil (Bonito flakes & scallop oil) & Tabera garlic & onion w/chili oil) I didn't use any as the clam ramen was excellent already.

I found the house ramen to lack flavor, possibly because I'm comparing it against tonkotsus from other ramen bars. The chashu in the ramen was also tough and put together just a subpar ramen for $14. \n\nThe chicken ramen ($15) however was a welcome choice, slightly off the beaten trail. It was flavourful and the chicken wings were marinated and the meat literally falls off the bones. The half mushroom in the chicken ramen was also done properly and a good fit into the dish. Both ramens came with half an egg, done as expected of a top Ramen place. I'd definitely return here for the chicken ramen, and possibly look forward to try the clam ramen once it is back in season as well! \n\nMy only complaint is that the hot tea, although comes in a fancy pot, was not very hot.

You get five per order with dipping sauce. \n\nI ordered the House ramen bowl and my friend had the chicken ramen.\n\nHouse ramen arrived warm but not boiling hot. Standard toppings include green onions, nori, half a soft cooked egg, 2 chashu slices, and bamboo shoots. Bamboo shoots were very tasty. Noodles were thick and chewy as I prefer. These were perfect for grabbing the broth. Broth was clean and light. I prefer a rich tonkotsu broth, but the clear fish-based ramen was a nice change of pace.\n\nIf tonkotsu broth is a heavy workout for your palette, this dashi broth is a leisurely walk; but a pleasant one. \n\nTonkotsu broth is a quite popular with ramen lovers. With dashi broth they're doing counter programming which is a smart strategy. \n\nChicken ramen bowl includes three chicken wings, shiitake, green onions, nori and half a soft cooked egg. Chicken wings were fall off the bone delicious. Tastewise; I preferred the chicken ramen broth. Given a choice, I would rather have chicken meat slices in lieu of chicken wings. That would be the perfect chicken ramen configuration for me. \n\nIf you're a protein fiend like me, you will have to load up on extra chashu toppings or appetizers to appease your dietary needs. For light eaters, the ramen bowl as is will suit you. There is a vegetarian ramen bowl option if you are so inclined. \n\nStandout for me was the service and atmosphere. Very friendly staff and orders shouted out ramen house style. They yell irasshaimase like in Japan as you enter. Noren curtain at the entrance. Nice interior touches for an authentic feel. \n\nRamen houses tend to cram customers in like sardines for logical reasons. This place is airy and bright. The outlying tables are nicely spaced. Gives you some breathing room to enjoy some personal space.\n \nPrivate dining is available in the back. Patrons get a shout out as they leave. There was a short line as we left.

If you know me, I'm an actual ramen snob and I don't just toss out 5 stars when it comes to ramen restaurants. So Hinodeya is something special. \n\nHinodeya serves up a bit different style of ramen that what I'm used to. Fish based broth instead of my usual soy sauce base. I was a bit skeptical at first to be honest. Fish based? Am I about to eat the ocean? But holy heck, this was delicious. Most bowls of ramen I've had lately have been lacking in certain qualities, but Hinodeya was so solid across the board. Noodles were firm and tasty, veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the meat was just perfect in terms of amount of flavor and tenderness. Really though, the main thing when it comes to ramen was the broth, and Hinodeya has it just right. Perfect amount of flavor that tied every ingredient together just right. \n\nThy really do just get everything right. I loved the sake flight that we ordered along with our meal. Service was very attentive and friendly. Price was right about what I thought I'd pay. Just all around solid, like their ramen. \n\nA good bowl of ramen to me is like a puzzle, where each piece completes the other. Hinodeya gets that puzzle picture perfect. So happy with my meal here.

The broth is so clean and light yet flavorful and rich with dashi, and the noodles are perfectly chewy and have some bounce while being al dente. I do think that the cha siu here is okay, but I'm willing to forego that when the dashi and noodle balance is so well done. They have an ajitama but nothing memorable to me about that. \n\nI admit that Hinodeya is definitely on the pricier side, but I think unfortunately ramen is just trending in that direction as SF gets more and more expensive as a city. It's a bummer since ramen is seen as fast casual food in Japan, but hey, you have to pay for good quality. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Hinodeya and definitely would recommend it.

There was chashu, menma (bamboo shoots), half of a stewed egg, and a lot of green onions. The chashu was very tasty. The noodles were unique and went well with the dashi broth.

Here is what me and my friends ordered:\n\nFried oysters $8\nChicken kaarage with matcha salt $8\nHinodeya (house ramen) $14\nTori Paitan $15\n\nYou must MUST start your meal with both the fried oysters and chicken kaarage that comes with green match salt. The matcha in the matcha salt is very subtle but it does make a slight difference crispy piping hot chicken kaarage. It's the perfect appetizer before diving into rich flavorful ramen. Now why is it so popular? It's all about the execution of the dishes, and the base of the broth that makes people go woah that's different. What drawn me to try this place was that Hinodeya ramen base was dashi! Hinodeya dashi is made of a tuna fish and kombu seaweed. Now let's dissect this ramen. You know it's a good ramen place when the following things happen: the pork was melting in your mouth, the egg yolk was stil runny and the broth didn't need much additional fixings. It's a really good ramen spot to go to when your in the Jtown area. \n\nTip: once you tasted the broth and are well into your meal, I suggest adding two teaspoons of the garlic chili oil. ITS A GAME CHANGER! It boosted the broth 100x times. I HIGHLY SUGGEST ADDING that oil! \n\nParking: if you come at night, their is plenty of parking.

I noticed that after 7 was when a crowd of people started rolling in - come before 7 pm to avoid a wait! \n\nWe ordered two side dishes to share: a raw octopus mixed with wasabi and some vegetables (I don't think the dish was on the menu.) It was very, very small - the octopus was cut into tiny pieces, such that it's hard to pick up any taste other than the wasabi that covered it (that surface area to volume ratio.) We also had the crispy fried yam. The name of this dish was deceiving for us - my boyfriend ordered our side dishes for us, so our friend and I didn't read the description of the dish. It's actually nagaimo, not the usual yellow/orange yam we pictured. I've never had nagaimo before and wasn't a huge fan of this dish - it tasted like deep fried lotus root.... and that doesn't go well together. \n\nWe all ordered the Hidoneya house ramen. It was delicious! There's also an assortment of sauces available on the dining table, such as umami oil. The dashi soup was unexpectedly rich in flavor. The whole wheat ramen noodles were also great - I like the chewy texture. The only complaint is that the soup was too flavorful... as we neared the last bites of our ramen, the dish was especially salty. We had to drink so much water to overcome the saltiness. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was bolstering and friendly.

The noodles were perfectly chewy, but I felt like the portion size was a little small, especially for the price. The broth was creamy and flavorful, but definitely heavier and more oily than the tonkatsu broths I'm used to. I actually preferred the dashi broth, which was light and had a hint of seaweed flavor but no fishiness, so I would probably get the Hinodeya ramen if I came here again.\n\nWhile I wasn't disappointed by their ramen, it wasn't exactly mindblowing either, but I was also only able to order from the limited menu available during the festivities. I'd be willing to come back to try the tsukemen off the regular menu, and if you've never had these two broths before you should at least give it a try.

I was visiting Japantown for the cherry blossom festival and decided to give this place a try!\n\n* * * EXPERIENCE * * *\nI arrived before 11:30am which is supposed to be their opening time on Sunday, saw this place was half full already. I guess they have special open hours because of the festival? Outside the door they actually divided the waiting line area into \"to-go\" and \"dine-in\". I'm not sure if the to-go is a thing they always do or just for this weekend though. \n\nWent into the store with the usual \"Irasshaimase\" welcome. Service was quick and every staff really paid attention to each customer. The lunch menu wrote \"Limited menu for Cherry Blossom Festival\" but I didn't find anything special there. Oh well, in terms of ramen there were only two choices - Hinodeya Ramen which is a house ramen, and Tori Paitan with chicken broth flavor. I was very tempted to try the Tori one as I wanted to see how its compared with Mensho which I regard as pretty much the best ramen in SF. But to give a fair judgement to the restaurant I felt I should go with the House ramen instead.\n\n* * * FOOD * * *\nHinodeya Ramen: A.\nSurprisingly good! First look of the soup, I hesitated if I really made the right choice because it's very clear (with some oil drops) and a lot of times clear/watery can be two interchangeable descriptions. But after I took the first sip I had a lack of word to describe the clear yet rich, non-salty soup base. According to their website, the soup base is made with kelp, dried bonito flakes, dried small sardines mainly with some chicken and scallop to complete it. So it's all seafood and a bit of white meat, but how they made it so rich and flavorful with these ingredients remains unknown to me. \n\nThe noodle was pretty spongy (hard boiled) which is my favorite style. This ramen comes with half egg by default but I added two halves as additional toppings which was perfect, the eggs were very flavorful and very soft, one of the best soft-boiled egg I have had. Chashu was to the point in terms of flavor and tenderness but nothing spectacular, and it only came with 1 piece. What I think as an amazing touch was actually the green onion - it's not the usual tiny circular shape green onion, those were more of long oval shapes and they were super fresh, it enhanced taste of the soup to be even better, richer.\n\nThis ramen costs $14 and with the addition of egg ($2 extra) and tax the total was $17.36, so we are talking about the expensive spectrum of SF pricing for a ramen. But it was really good I think it could be justified.\n\nI will definitely come back again and try the Tori ramen!", "author": "Simon C."}

And the waits aren't even that bad.\n\n*food*\nThis is the go-to-ramen-joint when you want unpretentious ramen. The flavors here are light, not greasy, and still give you pep in your step after eating a steamy bowl of ramen noodles. No food comas, thanks. \n\nYou will usually find me ordering a starter of karaage chicken or fried oysters. More often than not, I will order the crispy, delicate chicken that comes with some green tea salt on the side and a lemon wedge. They come perfectly breaded and crispy in sizes that last 3-5 bites depending on how hungry you are. After carefully squeezing the lemon wedge with one hand over the chicken and the other covering the splatter of acidic juices darting towards my friends' eyes, you dab the chicken in some of the matcha-like salt, take a bite and tasty that tender, chicken juiciness.  After 2 minutes, you look at the final piece of chicken with a little bit of guilt, wondering if it would be possible to split the last piece with everyone else. The answer is usually yes, just use your hands and don't try to pry it with your chopsticks like a fool.\n\nWith perfect timing and graceful fashion, a server picks up your empty chicken plate and another server quickly arrives delivering bowls of magical noodles. The first thing you notice is the presentation - beautiful bowls that look like gardens of springy, ramen noodles, crispy, roasty nori, perfect little rectangle bamboo shoots, large oval chunks of clean looking chashu pork, and green onion shavings - all swimming in a glistening, but not overly oily pool of dashi broth. Tableside you have some condiments of garlic chili oil and an umami paste made from Bonito & Scallop - I overload on these condiments sometimes because they're just so damn good. The noodles have a perfect springy bite to them and I find myself attempting to slurp as loud as possible to pay my respects. Still an amateur at slirping. After eating all the goodies, you lift the bowl up to your face to give a good slirp of the soup until all you see is the art painted onto the beautiful bowls they use. And after all that food, you don't feel nasty or oily, just perfectly content and satisfied. \n\nMorover, their selection of Sakes is on point. \n\n*Decor* \nThe space is broken up into a large main area with community tables in the center, 2-4 seating side tables along the walls, a ramen bar on the right side. And towards the back rooms, they have barriers that separate 2-4 seating side tables that have a corridor to the back where the restroom is. There is Japanese decor right when you enter the front, modern wood textures and when you look up above the community tables you see lightbulbs intertwined with a wooden branch chandelier. All together, it feels real, authentic, and right- it feels balanced. \n\n*Service*\nOver the 10+ times I've been here, there hasn't really been waits, and if there was, they weren't longer than 15-20 minutes. Just prepared to line up outside and have enough to wear as it can get cold because it is San Francisco. As soon as you are seated, water arrives to the table and you are welcomed with a smile. Service is quick and courteous. What I love most is that last time I came with my sister who has a laundy list of food restrictions, and the server listened intently and with caution to make sure she got it right. The food came and one thing was off and they quickly came up with a creative solution to provide my sister with a tasty bowl of custom ramen. \n\nI will most likely be coming back here for life.", "author": "Geronimo Carlo R."}

They have these whole-wheat noodles that appear and taste more like hand pulled noodles than the thin, curvy, and yellowey ramen noodles we're all used to seeing. The noodles were a bit chewy (i love texture), definetly not overcooked (not mushy), and were able to sit in the broth without sucking up all the soup. Make sense? :) In your bowl, you'll also find a generous portion of fresh chopped scallions (yay!)! \n\nThe Dashi broth was refreshing and light. We loved our first taste of the broth (flavorful, light, full of umami), but then as you slurp more and more, it gets more and more salty, which begs you to gulp down water...... \n\nOverall, I recommend Hinodeya and am so glad that Japantown FINALLY has a good ramen place! Go around 5 to avoid the line. If you get there around 6, you'd have to wait. Price is a bit high ($16 and $18 for our bowls of deliciousness) but I guess the owners have to pass on some of that expensive SF rent to us.", "author": "Dana Z."}

They opened up this private area in the back with two tables for us and another group of four, so it was pretty quiet where we were.\n\nTheir whole menu is pretty simple; there aren't a lot of appetizers and their ramen selection is limited to 2 options (at least for now). You can either get there signature Hinodeya Ramen ($14) which is made from a traditional Japanese style soup, or their Tori Paitan ($15) which has a rich chicken and dashi broth. My friends all went with the Hinodeya, but I ordered the Tori Paitan as I was really curious about their version of this ramen compared to Mensho's.\n\nOur food arrived very quickly after ordering, but that was one of the few good things about the meal. \n\nThe biggest problem was the quantity of food felt very little, especially given how pricey the ramen was here. When they tell you there's chashu or a chicken wing in your ramen, they really mean just one small piece. I saw one friend hold up one tiny piece of chashu, and that was all the meat he got for his whole bowl of ramen. If you look at my picture of the tori paitan ramen, everything you see is all the toppings in my ramen (one chicken wing, half of a soft-boiled egg, two shiitake mushrooms, and a piece of seaweed).\n\nThe broth for the Tori Paitan was disappointing as well. I love the rich and umami flavor found in a good chicken broth, and I just didn't get that here. Mensho's Tori Paitan broth had much better flavor imo.\n\nThe noodles were the saving grace of this meal. We all agreed the noodles, which were nice and firm,and made from buckwheat, were excellent.

Super crispy and juicy chicken thigh pieces with a pinch of green tea salt - you can actually taste the green tea.

I normally don't care for fried oysters since they tend to be on the heavy and oily side but that was not the case at all. \nHinodeya Ramen - thick al dente noodles with a unique and light dashi broth. It almost felt \"healthy\" just because the broth wasn't so heavy! The boiled egg was on point.\nTori Paitan Ramen - chicken + dashi based ramen broth that was surprisingly rich and a bit creamy for being made from chicken bones. The consistency is somewhat similar to that of Campbell's chicken noodle soup but not the same of course in terms of flavor, lol. This was good, but I liked the Hinodeya broth more. The chicken leg that came with this was almost a little too soft since it was falling apart in the soup. \n\nTo sum it up, Hinodeya is a pretty good ramen shop and you can taste the quality in their ingredients.

The broth for the Hinodeya Ramen (it's an item on the menu, named for the restaurant) is perfect! I've finally found a bowl of ramen that is just the right amount of savory, light enough to drink the whole bowl of soup (which I never do).\n\nWhat if you (or your friend) prefer creamy broth? Not to worry, the other ramen option on the menu, Tori Paitan, is creamier with more flavor than the Hinodeya Ramen.\n\nThe other items on the menu are pretty delicious as well: I recommend the karaage chicken with matcha salt (though to be honest I'm not sure I can taste the matcha in the salt...) and my friends enjoyed the matcha panna cotta for desert, which we were told is a \"very traditional\" Japanese desert.

Okay, honest mistake probably - but if you didn't hear something correctly, maybe ask to clarify rather than guessing incorrectly? I would've said something but my friend ended up drinking it so whatever.\n2) The next waitress who took our next round of drinks asked for our ID's but ended up asking how old we are anyway because she couldn't do the math. Maybe I'm just used to bartenders knowing off the top of their head, but I honestly feel you should be prepared if you're asking. After that, it just got awkward with her laughing at herself and switching between \"I'm just kidding\" and \"I'm bad at math\".\n3) At the end of our meal, I asked the waiter for the dessert menu. He came back and gave it to my male friend sitting across from me. What? If you're only going to bring one dessert menu for a table of 3, you give it to the person who asked for it right? When he came back to take our dessert orders, he also asked my friend what he wanted first. Hello????\n\nAnyway, I ordered the Tori Paitan expecting a thick white soup. But there was nothing thick or white about the very minimal soup in my bowl. It was watery and clear. But the noodles were soft and chewy. The meat from the chicken wings literally fell off the bone from the braising. I added chashu, which was nice, but also made my ramen a whopping $19!!!!!!!!! I think that's too expensive for what it was. I wasn't even full afterwards.\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm being a ramen snob but this wasn't my cup of tea. And it's such a bummer because I took my two friends here to try it out as their first real ramen experience. If this was my first ramen experience, I probably wouldn't love ramen as much as I do.

My bf and I went at about 7:30pm on a Sunday night and there was a short line of about 5-7 parties ahead of us.

Also there is more seating in the back past where you can see from standing in line in front of the window! We were seated in about 20ish minutes. \n\nThe interior is pretty modern and nice. Different than the whole in the wall places I've been to before. The service was prompt. Less than 5 minutes after we were seated someone took our order. The menu is pretty small. Two main ramen dishes, appetizers, sides, desserts and drinks. We were feeling basic and only order two Dashi Ramens and waters. I HIGHLY recommend the Dashi ramen. The broth is a lot lighter than other ramen I've had before but it is so flavorful! We both were able to finish the whole bowl in one go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-03", "description": "Of course, the bouge SF settles for a bowl of noodles with nothing less than famous ramen from Japan. Cue Mensho, enter Hinodeya, and brace yourself for the arrival of Ippudo. In the true spirit of ramen cult, a wait is expected, though Hinodeya is relatively more under-the-radar.\n\n[TL;DR] The epitome of the zen of ramen, with absolute precision--sipping the broth feels like foodie enlightenment. The plus is the unique concentration on simplicity, while the minus is that the simplicity means modest portions and basic toppings. Bring your soul but not your stomach.\n\n[PART ONE: THE ENTRANCE]\n\nWith its recent opening, Hinodeya still has some operational kinks to work out. Perhaps the most bothersome was the absence of a sign-in system; you wait in a line and the host checks periodically to take down the number in your party. Although physically standing in line does contribute to the experience and feels more authentic than technology (such as getting ten reminder emails from OpenTable), it doesn't work great in chilly SF weather. \n\nCurrently the wait is about 30 minutes during dinnertime, and you go through a strange rite of passage waiting in the cold, then being promoted to waiting in a little porch behind a flimsy curtain, and finally inside the restaurant and being reward by chairs. Given the many little shops of Japantown, I think a sign-in list would be a great way to triage the crowd.\n\n[PART TWO: THE RAMEN]\n\nHinodeya truly excels in the broth. As outlined in the website, Hinodeya has a long history and the broth has been trialed numerous times to perfection. Quality is noticeably outstanding, though the prices are steep and the portions are rather small. On the other hand, this forces you to eat slowly and thoughtfully. I was initially disappointed by the extremely limited quantities of toppings (only one thin slice of chashu in the Hinodeya, and only one tiny chicken wing in the Tori D:); on second thought, this too serves a purpose of placing the focus on the nuances of the wafu broth. \n\nI liked the mildly wheaty noodles, though I would appreciate it more boldly al dente. Also, our ramen tasted lukewarm but it is possibly because I took too long taking pictures. Of note, the half soft-boiled egg is on point with the quintessential liquid gold yolk.\n\n(+++) Hinodeya ramen ($14): The signature dashi broth, made with kelp, bonito, and sardines, fine-tuned with chicken and scallop. It doesn't taste like a seafood broth, and it was clear yet complex. To add to the paradox, I would describe it as close to umami as you have experienced, but as far from MSG as you can get. \n\n(+++) Tori paitan ($15): The broth was much richer, but mostly in the sense of a robust chicken flavor rather than being heavy. It's refreshing to have a hearty broth that's not overwhelmingly salty and fatty. The slightly bitter raw green onion slices complemented the roasty overtones flawlessly. While overall it little less precise than the dashi broth, it was a memorable fine-dining-caliber version of chicken noodle soup.\n\n(++) Matcha cappuccino ($8): I applaud the strong matcha taste and layers of various texture, from a predominantly creamy top, followed by a densely flavored panna cotta, and ending with matcha jelly. The composition was creatively reflective of a drink, complete with latte art.\n\nThe kara-age with matcha salt sounds interesting and is on my radar. The menu is fairly limited for now (which I actually like because it makes decisions easier). It is expected to expand to include more options such as a vegan ramen. \n\n$40 for two bowls of ramen and one dessert is pricey even for SF, but the broth is a dining experience in itself.\n\n[PART THREE: THE AMBIANCE]\n\nThey stress the concept of dining with five senses and strive for diners to be \"entertained by the exquisite harmony of the wafu ramen and the Japanesy surroundings.\" Hehe such an endearing description! ^^V The ambiance is indeed relaxing, with a spacious and well-lit interior, a minimalist selection of Japanese decor, and photogenic condiments in little wooden jars.\n\nMy last logistical gripe is that the bench chairs are a bit of a hassle because there's nowhere to put your coat and it takes quite some coordination to move the bench between two people (good couples activity for date night!)", "author": "Edna C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-06", "description": "4.5 STARS\n\nMy friend, Mr. Diva drives me insane sometimes (and I'm sure vice versa). Choosing a restaurant to go to is a whole methodical process - he wants to know who the chef is, his/her bio, where the restaurant originated from, what's on the menu, price points, any cute servers work there...the whole shabang. A link to an article doesn't suffice, he wants everything listed out by text. Shoot, picking a mail order bride is easier. \n\nAnd, then when we finally choose a place to dine at and have tasted the food, he says he can do a better job at home. Ok, says the person who constantly checks his reflection out (to his credit, he can really cook...he once delivered a sous vide pork belly with a 63 degree [runny] egg over furikake rice to me and it was bomb).\n\nLast week, I sent him a link to an article about the soft opening of Hinodeya Ramen Bar, and he agreed to go without hesitation. WOOT!\n\nHinodeya Ramen Bar took over the old Shalala Ramen space in Japantown and is the first U.S. outpost outside of Japan. Their specialty is a dashi based ramen. Instead of the typical pork bone based broth, their broth is made from a combo of preserved skipjack tuna and kombu seaweed. Currently for their soft opening, they have a limited menu with two ramen options: Hinodeya Ramen - dashi broth, whole wheat noodles, chashu, marinated soft boiled egg ($14) and Tori Paitan  - rich chicken + dashi broth, whole wheat noodles, braised chicken wing, marinated soft boiled egg ($15). They do NOT use msg in their broths which I confirmed with their manager. \n\nFor lunch apps, they have a salad or royal cheese. For dinner apps, they have fried oysters and chicken karaage. Beer and sake available. Once they officially open next year, their menu will expand with more apps, ramen options, and a chef's tasting menu. They will also accept reservations. \n\nUntil then, you'll have to brave the wait which is not bad compared to the opening lines at Mensho (2-3 hour wait). I came 30 minutes before opening and I was first in line. During peak times, it looks to be about an hour wait. There's only seats for about 30 people (back dining area is closed) so come with a group of 4 or less. \n\nWe started with the Cheese Royal ($5) which tasted like fermented blocks of cream cheese: http://bit.ly/2h3NXT7. The flavor is intense, almost pungent and better enjoyed with beer or sake. \n\nFor ramen, we each ordered the Tori Paiten Ramen ($15) and added chashu ($4): http://bit.ly/2gZcuWt. If you're a tonkotsu ramen person, than I highly recommend ordering the tori paitan. The broth is deeply rich without being overly heavy like Mensho's tori paitan. Lots of opulent chicken and umami flavor from the kombu. The whole wheat noodles were perfectly thick, wavy, and al-dente through the end of the bowl. While the braised chicken wing was fall-off-the-bone tender, you only get one mid-joint, so definitely add the chashu which is meltingly tender. The ajitsuke tamago (marinated soft boiled egg) was flavorful with a delicious molten center.  \n\nWe decided to also order the bowl of the Hinodeya Ramen ($14) for comparison: http://bit.ly/2g66Tkk. If you're a shio (salt) ramen person than you'll probably enjoy this ramen over the paitan. When I first read about the dashi based ramen, I thought ehhh fish based broth? To my surprise, it's very good. The clear broth has a lot of concentrated seafoody flavor without being \"fishy\". This one is saltier and oilier than the paitan so several spoonfuls was more than enough for me, especially after having a bowl of the tori paitan.\n\nEach table has a set of condiments: bonito, fried garlic, togarashi, and black pepper so you can doctor your ramen to your liking.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Kuro-Goma (Black Sesame) Ice Cream w/ granola ($5): http://bit.ly/2gNDf2h. The ice cream was super creamy and dense with lots of nutty sesame flavor. We enjoyed the Japanese granola (rice krispies) for crunch. \n\nService is friendly and quick, though we somehow received our ramen after several groups of people who had ordered well after us. It's just opening kinks and I'm sure the kitchen will get into their groove soon. \n\nMr. Diva and I both agreed (for once) that Hinodeya Ramen Bar currently has the best ramen in San Francisco in terms of broth, noodles, and quality of toppings. Mensho is excellent but it's hard to finish a bowl of their tori paitan ramen without feeling gross afterwards because of how heavy the broth is. \n\nOne last thing, please be mindful of others waiting outside in the cold and not sit there chitchatting for hours after finishing your bowl of ramen. Take your tinder horror story about how dude picked you up in a hearse (but you decided to bang him anyways) to the bar down the block. \n\nHappy Slurping! I mean the slurping ramen kind of slurping...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We were lucky enough to get seated in the first seating, and by the time we were done the line was EVEN LONGER O=\n\nI typically like the creamier broths, but decided to get the Hinodeya Ramen since it's their star item. The dash broth was SO freaking delicious. I didn't taste any fishiness, which I don't enjoy and am pretty sensitive. Egg so good as well! The chasu was extremely tender and pretty much melted in your mouth. Lots of green onion as well, but I love 'em so yay! Overall, a very refreshing and light bowl of ramen that was still extremely satisfying and filling. The bf ordered the Tori Paitan, which IMO is SO MUCH better than Mensho's. It's flavorful without being too thick and creamy. It's a tad on the saltier side, but still good. The chicken wing meat was fall off the bone and nicely marinated/flavored. Kuro-Goma ice cream was also very good! The sesame flavor isn't too strong, but I liked it and it had a nice consistency without being too grainy.\n\nI still haven't found ramen in the city that comes close to ramen in Japan. I think Hinodeya is close, but still isn't quite what ramen is in Japan. But again, it's close. And so good. *Terminator voice* I'll be back (and pray that there isn't a fat line out the door...).", "author": "Doris K."}

Came here on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm with a party of 5, and even though they did not take reservations, they have quite a large space and we were able to get seated fairly quickly (after about a 15 minute wait). Service was initially a little slow and they forgot one of our orders, but it was quickly rectified. I got the Hinodeya Ramen (house ramen, $14), which was a large serving of whole wheat noodles topped with chashu pork, soft cooked egg, dried seaweed, green onion, sesame seeds, and red pepper. The noodles were soft and chewy and the egg was cooked to runny perfection, but I didn't think the meat was as flavorful and tender as other ramen I have had. The broth was different - it was quite light and not as oily, which depending on what you are in the mood for, might just hit the spot. We also split a 300mL bottle of their sparkling sake ($15), which was very sweet and had a little lower alcohol content than usual (about 5%).\n\nOverall I would say that the ramen and the drinks were about a 3.5 to a 4, but what really pushed them over to beyond 5 stars is the experience of having a birthday there. It was my friend's birthday and we had bought a cake from Schubert's to surprise her. Initially the restaurant told us that their policy was not to allow any outside food, and were not going to let us celebrate with the cake. However, several of the staff members were incredibly nice and decided to make an exception and allow us to have the cake. Not only that, but they brought out the cake with a massive sparkler, all came and sang happy birthday to her, took a Polaroid of all of us that they gave us to keep, and even gave her a birthday hat to wear for the photo! They then cut the cake and brought out the pieces on individual plates. I was really blown away by how nice they were and how much effort they put into making it a great experience for her and her us. I am truly very grateful - thank you so much for being so kind!", "author": "Amy C."}

I think we interacted with almost all of the staff during dinner and each person had a smile on their face and was very helpful.\n\nI tried the Karaage and the Tori Paitan Ramen. The Karaage was composed of sizable chicken chunks and the batter was crispy yet light. It was also served with a shishito pepper which I gobbled up, and matcha salt which had a very nice acidity that paired well with the fried chicken. For the Tori Paitan, it was a smaller serving that I expected however still enjoyable. I loved the noodles -- flat, slightly thick and al dente. I haven't had noodles like these in any ramen before. The soft boiled egg was perfect, the braised wing was tender and added some umami flavor to the bowl, and the broth itself had a good chicken flavor with a clean yet rich texture. My only gripe was the heavy amount of green onion. I enjoy green onion but the amount in the bowl was heavy and overpowering.", "author": "Maya S."}

The soup base was super flavorful, with a dashi-like stock, but super light and perfectly salted. The noodles were also perfectly cooked, chewy and fresh. They also added toasted sesame seeds to the stock, which added extra fragrance to the entire dish. The ramen came with a piece of cha shu that was very good--one piece went a long way and was enough to fill your taste buds with a smoky, porky and rich flavor. There were also bamboo shoots that were crunchy and complemented the soft, chewy noodles well. I also enjoyed the soft boiled egg that came with it, since it had a smoky flavor and a soft, liquid center in the middle.\n\nOverall, a great ramen place!

We ended up only waiting about 10-15 minutes and were seated side by side at a communal table. It felt odd at first since we had just met for our first date and a little more privacy would've been nice.\n\nHinodeya is technically still in soft opening stage so not all of the options are available yet. Since there were two of us and we love to eat, we got both the Tori Paitan and Hinodeya ramen to share. I had been watching Midnight Diner on Netflix and there was an episode about fried yams so I talked my date into getting the Crispy Fried Yam as well. For $8, the yam was not a good value (compared to karaage at the same price and ramen for $14) but it satisfied by curiosity.\n\nTo my surprise, I liked the Tori Paitan ramen more because the broth is richer. As I'm getting older, I'm discovering that I never gave chicken a fair shot and I'm slowly learning to appreciate it more (but still no white meat!).", "author": "Yi Z."}

I understand it's two different types of ramen, but this place is not up to par from a flavor profile point of view. The noodles in the ramen (house ramen) were pretty good. They had a decent bite and were properly cooked. The broth on the other hand left a lot to desire. It was a bit sweet due to the heavy amount of bamboo shoots and green onion. It was also a bit bland and was not rich. It almost felt like hot water with a cube of pork broth, if the pork broth was missing salt and pepper. The meat was mostly fat and still was somewhat tough to chew. The octopus looked pretty disgusting as it was very slimy. \n\nService: after waiting for about 15 minutes, we went in and got seated by a gentleman who seemed very attentive. We were served by a lady who was, on the other hand, a bit less welcoming. She came off rude while we were trying to order. All in all we ordered after about 5 mins so I was happy. \nWe had ordered the wasabi octopus and House ramen. The octopus was an appetizer but they brought the ramen first. As always one person's order came out before the other, so one person was eating while the other is awkwardly hanging out. After about 2/3 minutes they brought the second person order \nI had even forgotten about the octopus, since I don't like it but my girlfriend noticed we hadn't received it. \nI left half of the ramen in the bowl. It wasn't really that good. We flag down the waitress to ask about the appetizer and she brought it to us. We had appetizer after the main course. \nLastly, we ask for the check and they hadn't even added all the items in the bill so I had to ask them to add the items before paying for it. They missed the octopus. \nAll together: we got tea (it's 4 bucks for a small pot) ramen and octopus and spent $50 bucks. I don't think this place has a good value given the price they charge. Most likely won't be returning.\n\nPS: their health score is only 79.", "author": "Ashish N."}

You get a single slice of pork, only HALF an egg (WTF, that's the best part), and the bowls were really small! The side of chicken was 2 baby wings the size of my pinky doubled.

Didn't taste any fish, which was a good thing! Rich in flavor but not thick and heavy. Thinner than your typical ramen broth due to the addition of dashi. Noodles were good but could have been more tender. Maybe I'll ask them for that next time! $15 for ramen is on the pricier end, but it was delightful, glad I tried it!\n\nMy friend got the Hinodeya ramen which comes with the  dashi broth, which was light and subtle. Very delicate but well rounded. I prefer heavy and hearty broths like tonkatsu, but this was a very welcome and refreshing change! I'd highly recommend it to any ramen lover to at least try.\n\nAPPS:\nKara aga with matcha salt was DELICIOUS. It has a lighter batter coating, in both thickness and in terms of color, than traditional kara age. Thin crispy exterior and JUICY white chicken meat! I was kind of doubting it when it came, as I like smaller, dark pieces, but glad I was proved wrong. They must brine the chicken very well as it was moist and very flavorful all the way through. YUM!\n\nAlso got the Tebasaki since we had both never heard of it, and you can't really go wrong with chicken wings! These, however, were more like stewed chicken wings (kinda like boiled chicken wings in some kind of soy broth), which came as a surprise (slight disappointment) - I think they should specify that this is NOT a fried dish.

Not all the tables were seated at the time we went despite a long line, and the bar seats were not ready yet, they were probably still in the process of a full official opening.\n\nWe got karaage for appetizer and Hinodeya ramen. Karaage was tender and tasty with the matcha salt (mostly salty flavor), with non-spicy pepper and spring onions among other green toppings that added to a nice presentation. For Hinodeya ramen, I liked the clear broth a lot - not so greasy that I could not drink the broth like several other ramen places, yet the dashi flavor was rich. Ramen came with one chashu slice, bamboo shoots, half a soft cooked marinated egg, seaweed, and green onions. They used curly flat whole wheat noodles, which were chewy, unique and my favorite kind of noodles.\n\nAll staff seemed knowledgable and well versed in Japanese as well, we heard them telling the back story of one of their sake. Service was prompt and friendly, and the interior was bright and modern with Japanese feel like the tablecloth and bag basket.

The broth was super clear, very flavorful, but a tad too salty for me. My favorite part of this was their ramen, it had the bouncy elastic feeling in my mouth as I chewed it. Their egg was boiled to just a little runny in the middle and tender. The chashu was tender, but not super soft to the point where it was falling apart. This spot is a different, the ramen is a must!

However, not it's not terrible, I find that somehow the ramen here doesn't excite me.  Their broth in the dashi ramen is pretty good but I thought the ramen (at least in my opinion) was just okay and the pork was nothing special.  Also there were two times when I came for the clam ramen only for it to be sold out.  Last week when I arrived early enough to order it, I found it to be such a disappointment in that the clam meat was not very good.  My friend felt that, because they used a larger-size clam, it was not suitable for this type of cooking and they would've been better off using smaller manila clams.\n\nThe service is nice, I have to give them credit for that.  Also it's nice that, on their bill, there's no employee health tax surcharge (like a couple of the other ramen places in Japantown) and they calculate their suggested tip based on the before-tax total (which I feel it should always be).", "author": "H K."}

Our group ordered both the House Ramen (4/5) (thick noddles, chashu pork, bamboo, and soft boiled egg in light dashi soup base) and the Chicken Ramen aka. Tori Paitan (4/5) (thick noddles, 3 pieces of chicken wings, mushroom, and soft boiled eggs in creamy chicken stock). Both ramen dishes were flavorful and refreshing but I like the traditional taste of their house ramen a little more. The kara-age was fried to crispy heaven perfection (5/5). The matcha salt didn't do much flavor wise but it is pretty to look at. Service was good, the waiters and waitress were helpful in explaining the menu and bringing the food out. Wait was less than 5 minutes at noon on a Sunday. Overall, great meal, will come back for more.", "author": "Vivi L."}

The dashi broth of the house Ramen is homemade, fresh, decadent, and outrageously delicious. Perfect portion size, just enough. The dashi broth is a clear broth as opposed to the typical tonkotsu ramen broths at other ramen joints. I am a fan of this type of ramen broth, so maybe I am biased, but from what I can see, everyone agrees. \n\nI've been here a few times, if you come about 30 minutes after opening, you can avoid the line, as you are in between waves.

There was no wait and we were immediately seated in a semi-private space in the back (great space for larger groups).\n\nAll their ramen come with a dashi based broth (clear, cleaner, and lighter) versus the heavy tonkotsu broth at most other ramen joints in the Bay. The noodles were flat and wide and cooked perfectly al dente. \n\nHinodeya Ramen: Their house ramen. Dashi style broth (made from bonito, kombu and scallop) with whole wheat noodles, chashu pork, soft boiled egg, dried seaweed and green onion.\n\nHamaguri Ramen: Littleneck clam, whole wheat noodles, dashi broth, green onion and shredded red pepper.

It was a clear light broth with a wonderful umami flavor. There was a nice fatty piece of pork in there as well but the broth really stole the show of that bowl.\n\nThe Tori Paitian is a completely different animal of a ramen. This too was delicious but the broth was rich like a tonkatsu. The fat coated the noodles so that they were velvety in every bite. Flavor wise, its distinctly different from a pork based broth. I feel that it is sweeter but also lighter.\n\nEach bowl came with a fair portion of noodles that were different from any ramen noodles I've had. They are thick and wavy and chewy! By volume. you get a substantial amount of food just from the noodles.

To me, ramen is all about the broth and the broth here simply lacks the depth of flavor to bring me back again. \n\nThe space is new and very nice. Service reminded me of places in Tokyo where you are treated like a king. Right when we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly server who sat us immediately and happily accommodated our request for a high chair. They even brought hand towels for us to wipe our hands before the start of the meal which is very commonplace at restaurants in Japan. Accordingly, I had very high hopes for the meal and was very excited about getting our food. \n\nWe started with the Kara-Age which was very lightly coated in flour before frying so it was mostly chicken and not batter. Chicken meat itself was cooked well and was juicy but no seasoning was added. The order came with a side of matcha salt for us to sprinkle ourselves. I prefer my food to be seasoned before it leaves the kitchen so this really bothered me. For our main meal, we ordered the House Ramen which had a very unimpressive dashi broth. When I have ramen, the noodles are important but it's mostly all about the broth. The noodles here were stellar and super chewy and delicious. However, I don't consider noodles the highlight of a bowl of ramen so was really looking for more depth of flavor from that broth. There was spicy shallot chili oil and umami paste on the table to add yourself. I used both and still felt the broth was lacking the kind of richness that can only be imparted from hours and hours of cooking. \n\nThe meal was filling and I could tell they used good quality ingredients. Portions were good and prices were reasonable as well. But the broth was just average and for that reason, I didn't find the bowl of ramen to be that good. I also would have liked the chicken to be seasoned before it came to the table. I think I would come back if other ramen places in Japantown had too long of a line but this is definitely not amongst my top 3 for favorite ramen restaurants.", "author": "Betty R."}

It's a bit on the pricey side (about $14-$18 a bowl depending on what you get) but at the same time that's like typical SF prices now for a GOOD bowl of ramen. \n\nTheir house Hinodeya ramen ($14) is really good as it's a broth made of bonito, kombu and scallop which gives it more of a rich seafood flavor! The toppings it comes with are half an egg, a piece of pork chashu and bamboo shoots. I still haven't tried their tori paitan chicken ramen ($15) , which some of my friends who had it said it has really good flavor even though the broth is lighter in texture than the one at Mensho. They also have two other choices, the vegan ramen ($15) and Hamaguri ($18), a garlic clam flavor. All bowls of ramen come with whole wheat noodles, except the vegan one that has spinach noodles instead! I also tried their fried oysters here before which are really good and a great starter to share with others, and the pictures of the karaage look pretty bomb too. \n\nAlso get the matcha cappuccino dessert here as a finisher! Normally I'd get dessert elsewhere as Japantown has a great selection of sweets to eat, but after seeing pictures of their matcha cappuccino it looked like something I had to try as a girl with a big sweet tooth. It's a delicious panna cotta with bits of matcha jelly cubes and red bean in middle! \n\nService is great here and the environment is super clean!

Pleased to say it's one that I would visit to satisfy a ramen craving :) Broth, noodles, well-balanced.\n\nHinodeya's special is their dashi broth ramen, which isn't something you see on the menu generally in the bay area. In comparison to tonkotsu and tori paitan, the dashi broth is lighter but, by default, full of umami. I think it's something that should be appreciated because most of the dashi we eat nowadays is instant dashi, not the nuanced, layered taste of house-made dashi. After you start having ramen that achieves these subtleties, you can note the differences between your packaged soup stock and something prepared with care in a restaurant. Hinodeya hits the spot for me in their dashi broth. \n\nThe tori paitan broth definitely held the essence of chicken stock, but I crave the creaminess that Mensho creates.", "author": "Kathy Z."}

However, this was the tiniest portion of ramen I had ever eaten. My friend and I were so hungry we ordered another bowl and split it, so I did get to try both kinds of ramen. If you're in the area, Hinodeya is worth stopping by. The noodles are really firm, the way I like my ramen noodles. Otherwise, gets lost in the pack of all the great ramen restaurants in the Bay Area.\n\n[Food]\nI love the fried chicken here. It was amazing - highly recommend this appetizer. The flavor was great and really juicy, and not too oily or salty. I tried the House and Tori Paitan Ramen. Maybe I was really hungry or I just eat a lot, but man those bowls were small. I do prefer a thicker, richer broth, but it was nice that after I had finished my ramen I didn't feel super thirsty. I think I preferred the Tori Paitan Ramen just slightly, but didn't have very strong feelings about the meal.\n\n[Service]\nWe got there early and were seated immediately. The ramen did come out really slow for 5:00pm on a Friday afternoon. Our servers were friendly. \n\n[D\u00e9cor]\nThe restaurant is actually a bit more spacious than your regular tiny ramen parlor. There is bar seating and larger tables for big parties. Nothing special about the interior design.\n\nOverall, Hinodeya was an average ramen meal. I didn't go home dreaming about the noodles or the broth. My Japanese coworker, however, raves about Hinodeya so maybe its based on preference.

I really really really wanted try to the clam ramen but I'll have to return the full menu is offered. \n\nStarted off with the cheese royale, an order of wings, and kara-age. The wings are boring, pass. They just taste like adobo. Nothing too special, and it is the same chicken wing that is in the tori paitan. Loved the cheese royale! Cubes of cheese  with hunks of wasabi. DELICIOUS. Kara-age was also nothing special, you can skip this. My friend and I were just really hangry. We ordered tea as well, and at $4 a cup THEY DO NOT REFILL! Good lord! FOUR DOLLARS A CUP! eek, methinks not....\n\nI had the hinodeya ramen while my friend opted to try the tori paitan. Both of us found the hinodeya to have much better. While a very light broth, it packed a lot of umami. Do not overload your bowl of ramen with the fried garlic chips at the table! They will be overkill. The tori paitan..while good and hearty, got boring. It was like a light comforting chicken noodle soup. \n\nI normally do not mind communal seating. But at Hinodeya? They packed us in at that table TIGHT. I got seated near the end, a woman and her kid were at the edge and her husband was sitting opposite of me. They had some sort of disagreement which ended up with him only speaking to the kid, the both of them trying to feed the kid , the wife intermittently stating \"oh so you're not going to talk to me huh? Only Mia? I see how it is\"\n\nMia also kept trying to reach over and take my chicken wings. Mia, this is how you lose a hand. Don't you ever ever ever ever ever steal a hangry b1tch's chicken wangs. EVER.\n\nCommunal seating is ok when you don't pack us in like sardines. That made it unpleasant.

Highly recommend to pay for the parking structure instead of looking for street parking. \n-Only two type of ramen broth (fish or chicken broth) but I personally prefer pork broth.\n\nP.S.

Around the time our table was ready though I saw a line start to form outside so you might want to show up before 6:30pm to avoid too long of a wait.\n\nWe started with an order of the chicken karage, which was tasty and came with a little dish of matcha salt and lemon wedge to top them off. It arrived hot and crispy and I only wish it came with more and bigger pieces! My friend and I both ordered the Hinodeya Ramen. I enjoyed the broth which was clear, and lighter than most other ramen broths you'll see around, but still full of flavor. The noodles had a nice bite to them and the egg was perfectly cooked. Sadly there was only one piece of meat though and a little too many scallions, they formed a solid layer above my noodles. \n\nWe ended with the black sesame ice cream which comes with small crispy bits that taste like rice krispies (don't know if that's what they actually were), topped off with some whipped cream and a single raspberry. It was light and creamy and the perfect way to end the meal. \n\nThe reason my rating isn't higher is that the ramen was solid and tasty but not earth-shattering or something necessarily worth waiting in a long line for.

The portion size is perfect for one person to get happily full.\n\nThe customer service is excellent. The workers are so kind and they're open to answering any questions about the menu and suggesting drinks (if you ask).

I had tried to go here a few weeks ago with a group of 6 but the line was ridiculous. This time it was just me and my boyfriend and we decided to try and grab a quick bite after we watched a movie at the Kabuki theater. Sure enough, no line!\n\nWe both decided to try the Hinodeya Ramen. Granted, there's only two options. That and the chicken broth one. Seeing as this place is named \"Hinodeya\" we just tried their main ramen. Overall? Pretty tasty. Noodles are different - more of a flat curly noodle. And their broth is clear. Obviously, this means that the ramen overall is not as thick and rich as others. That's not necessarily a bad thing - it's just different!\n\nThe standard option includes bamboo shoots, green onion (if you like green onions, you'll love it here. they really top it off), half an egg, and a thin slice of chashu pork. But again, since we're in SF and ramen bowls are a whopping $14 (yes, seriously), the price is a little off-putting...especially when you get one VERY THINLY sliced pork. Any extra? Pay an addition $3 (or $4...can't remember).\n\nI may sound a little harsh here, but I expected a lot more with the great early reviews. I mean, there are items on the menu that are not ready yet since this place is brand new, but their main ramen was nothing spectacular. And quite empty.

The chef is a 4th generation chef/owner. His great grandfather opened Hinodeya in 1885. \n\nLuckily, a friend was willing to come with me. We waited an hour and a half...you could put your name down (no reservations during soft opening) and walk around the plaza or go across the street to Japantown Peace Center. The place fits maybe 30 people in the main area, and there are two curtained off rooms that fit 6-8 each in the back. That's why the wait is so long (and so many people have heard about the opening).\n\nTheir special ramen is the dashi--its broth is made from kelp and katsuobushi (the flakes you see on takoyaki and okonomiyaki). It's a lighter brother (vs miso which is milky and thicker). It had a lot of umami in it and I enjoyed it. The noodles were really good -- they were thicker and really chewy (in a good way). They held up well too, they didn't break down after being in the broth for a while. The egg was perfection. The only thing I didn't like was the meat...it tasted different from what I'm used to...I can't put my finger on it. The dashi ramen was $14, which is about average for a good bowl of ramen in SF. \n\nThey had two additional ramens listed on the menu (one is a vegetarian one!), but they were greyed out. They're going to add them once they get operations down during soft opening; there's going to be more options on the menu (for those of you fretting about only having two ramen options on the menu)!\n\nOh, we both got the fried oysters to start.

This was my 3rd stop. (Of course I've had ramen plenty of times before this spree of mine) \nWe arrived around 5:45pm and there was no wait for our party of two. We were seated at the bar. \nTLDR (Scroll down) :P \n\nRAMEN: \nCurrently they only have 2 different ramen on their menu. Hinodaya (scallop, bonito based) and Tori Paniton (creamy chicken based). Both ramen are served with whole wheat noodles - which the health-conscious side of me loved! There are 2 more to be added including a vegan ramen. Of course we ordered both ramen in addition to 2 other dishes: \n\n+ Hinodaya ($14) I've actually never tried a ramen with a seafood based broth but it was a very clear and light broth. Not creamy at all. It was served with only one chasu, half an egg, bamboo shoots and scallions. I did enjoy the lightness but personally preferred the chicken ramen more. \n+ Tori Paniton ($14) Creamy chicken broth with a hint of sesame as with many other ramen broths. I really enjoyed the broth's consistency & taste as it wasn't too thick or oil. (Mensho in DT SF has a much thicker consistency to give a comparison). This bowl came with a chicken wing and half an egg. Which was a little awkward in my opinion. There could have at least been 2 or 3 wings. \n+  Kara-age w/ Matcha Salt ($8) the chicken was super fresh and not overly battered compare to many other Japanese places. There was more meat than batter :) As for the matcha salt. The matcha was extremely subtle and barely tastable. I would recommend sprinkling the matcha salt on the  chicken to actually taste it as opposed to dipping the chicken into the salt. It becomes too salty. \n+ Matcha Cappuccino ($8) THIS WAS BOMB. I'm the biggest fan of all the things matcha and this was so damn good. It's actually a matcha panna cotta but they call it a cappuccino because they add whipping cream on top and add Latte art. In the center is a small scoop of red bean (which wasn't overly sweet) and matcha agar agar. Everything just worked so well together. The sweetness and texture was perfect. \n\nSERVICE: \nIt's one of those ramen shops where all the staff greets you when you walk in in Japanese. I'm pretty certain everyone there speaks fluent Japanese which adds to the authenticity of the place. (Pretty sure that's what they are going for when hiring their staff) Extremely friendly staff and food came out pretty fast.  \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery cute entrance! And the interior is pretty modern with a touch of traditional decor. They have family style seating where you might be seated at the same table as strangers if you are a party of 1-2. They seat parties of 1-10. \n\nOverall, the highlight of the ramen was the creamy egg, the whole wheat noodles and the broth. Loved the matcha cappuccino & will be back to try their other desserts. I wouldn't come here if you crave lot is protein with you ramen because this is a ramen bar that focuses primarily on flavor.", "author": "Samantha F."}

The broth was flavored with whole wheat ramen noodles cooked al dente, sesame, bonito, and delicious green onions, a tasty fresh egg, menma, and dried seaweed. The flavors combined left you with an amazing mouthfeel and ramen experience. Also, each of the vegetables were perfectly cooked so that their texture was not overly chewy and paired well with the broth. \nThe edamame had the traditional simple taste, but was cooked well so no piece was cold or watery.\nThe green tea was the perfect temperature for the season and was brought out at a drinkable temperature along with their yummy desserts. We purchased the Kuro-Goma ice cream (black sesame) and the matcha cappuccino. The Kuro-Goma ice cream had a nice creamy texture and was paired with a crunchy granola that was fruity to taste. The matcha cappuccino was not cappuccino at all (which is good, because I'm not a coffee fan -- but I am a huge fan of green tea). This dessert had a lovely panna cotta base for the top layer and included vanilla whipped cream with matcha flakes. Further spoonfuls brought you to other layers with mochi, sweet red bean and matcha flakes. The whole meal was a five star experience from each dish being perfectly cooked and well flavored and the amazing experience brought by the staff. The staff was extremely friendly, efficient, and sweet even giving me an origami swan to take home. Their ordering system was on point too.

Soup was clear and noodle was thick and wavy which my favorite. Overall I love the taste of it. $14 for a bowel of ramen is pricey considering you can get under $9 in Japan but it's SF.

While many other ramen establishments concentrate on the heavy tonkotsu broths, the signature dish here is a dashi based broth which has a lot of flavor but not as heavy as tonkotsu.  The Hinodeya Ramen might well be the single best one in San Francisco.\n\nThe primary gripe for this store is that it has a limited selection.  While they list a clam ramen and a vegetarian ramen on their take out menu, is was not avavilable for order.   Also, seating is cramped in this restaurant as we were forced to share a community table or sit at the counter.    For some reason, the previous business here (Shalala) made better use of the floor space and had a large dining area in the rear.  Furthermore, the sound level of this store is maddeningly deafening.  Workers are always shouting all the time and the acoutics seem to bounce the sound back down to the customers.  This is not a good quiet restaurant if you want to have decent conversation.  \n\nHopefully, they will make the vegetarian and clam ramen varieties availabler in the future.  For now, four stars until they get their menu up to speed and somehow fix their seating and sound problems.", "author": "Re-pley Z."}

The broth was really good and the noodles are very chewy. Their Cheese Royal is pretty good as well (small serving, but lots of flavor).

The pictures all look delicious. We came on a weeknight around 6pm and there was only a short line. We waited for around ten minutes or less and sat at the communal table for a party of two. \n\nThey are still in soft opening right now as of nov 2016 so service was a bit slow. They took our orders before those who sat before us. Communication between staff could be improved. We ordered two hinodeya dashi ramen and the fried chicken. Unfortunately the fried chicken never came. We didn't bother to follow up because we decided to order the chicken tori paitan ramen to share as well. \n\nTo start, the dashi ramen comes with half a soft boiled egg, one seaweed, one small slice of chashu, handful of bamboo and green onion. The presentation was nice and the broth was clean. However, this is very different than other ramen as this is very clean and light. It's like the broth you use before you start cooking your jap soupy dishes. I make a lot of dishes using dashi broth so maybe I'm used to dashi but the broth was very plain to me. It's definitely a solid dashi but I can't say it was mind blowing. \n\nThe tori paitan came with one chicken wing, egg, seaweed as well. The broth was def better than the standard dashi broth. But again, I did not have that OMG moment. If you come, I would recommend at least the paitan style as it clearly has more flavor. \n\nOverall, if you are in the area and there's no line, come here for a quick bowl. However, I wouldn't travel far or wait in a long line. It's a decent addition to the Bay Area with new options but I wouldn't add it as my to go ramen place. \n\nHave low expectations and be surprised. Don't expect strong flavors.", "author": "Sarah I."}

I did like the karaage chicken, which came with some type of matcha green tea dipping salt, which was unique.

I'm from SoCal, and have been searching for at least 4 years for something as good as DAIKOKUYA, Foo Foo Tei, or Kitakata Ramen Bannai and the like, and this comes close.\n\nHinodeya is located right across from Ramen Yamadaya (another one of my favs), and isn't overly priced. My wife ordered the Chicken Paitan, while I ordered the Hinodeya House Ramen and both bowls were done excellently. The noodles had a nice chew, the marinated & soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly, and each bowl's broth was light, but extremely flavorful. If you're looking for something with a punch, Yamada might be better suited. However, they DO have a spicy chili oil + other mixed goodies at your table that you can spoon into your bowl. I found that the addition of the oil really elevated the dish, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary.\n\nAlthough it isn't as fatty or as rich as I'm used to (compared to Daikokuya's Tonkotsu), the broth is just so damn good. I am probably in the minority who extremely dislike Mensho because of their dashi, so I'm glad that I found and have fallen in love with Hinodeya!\n\nI also highly recommend getting the Aburi Chashu as a side-order or appetizer. It's done a bit differently than the chashu included in the bowl of the Hinodeya Ramen since it's drizzled with a bit of sauce and served over a bed of sliced green garlic (or maybe it's green onions...).\n\nDefinitely coming back!", "author": "Patrick K."}

As we expect in the Japanese restaurant, the service was great. The Hinodeya Ramen comes with Kombu Dashi broth, half boiled egg, bamboo shoot, nori, and pork Chashu. Most of all, the broth is rich to feel its Kombu-based seafood broth. I was really surprised that this broth is so clear. The noodle is thicker than other ramen noodles, and it absorbs the rich flavor of the broth. The seasoned egg is perfectly cooked, and the chopped spring onions give the refreshed flavor.\n\nMy concern is that there is not enough parking space near the street and because this restaurant is in Japantown, it is hard to find the parking spot.", "author": "Jae Geun J."}

The chicken karaage came out first, and was nicely breaded and fried - with a side dish of matcha salt. I liked it, but prefer dark meat.\n\nThe tori paitan was flavorful and delicious - just a notch below Mensho's. If you prefer a less rich broth than tonkotsu or Mensho's ramen, you might like it. The noodles were perfectly cooked with a nice chewiness. The egg was delicate and so soft.

It hasn't received quite the hype that Mensho has, and I'm hoping it stays that way so that the wait never ends up being too long!\n\nWith that being said, I've never had to wait more than 20 mins for a table in the 3 times I've been here. I've come on a Friday around 6pm twice and on a Saturday night with a large group around 8pm and still have never waited more than 20 mins. They have plentiful seating here (more seating in the back that you don't realize when you walk in). The staff greets you when you enter and leave, which I thought was a very friendly and personable touch.\n\nThey currently have 4 ramen options, which previously used to only be 2 when I first came here. They have a limited number of appetizers as well. What I've tried so far:\n\n- Chicken karaage: cooked to perfection and paired well with a matcha salt\n- Hinodeya ramen: to die for! This is my first time trying a dashi (fish) based broth. I've been accustomed to mostly pork and miso broths so I initially had my reservations on how a fish based broth would taste. But my oh my, I was so pleasantly surprised to discover how light but extremely flavorful the broth was! It is just completely packed with flavor, without being too salty or fishy. It doesn't give off a fishy taste at all, in fact. On top of that, the noodles and egg are cooked PERFECTLY. Always comes with a perfectly runny and flavorful soft boiled egg. *drool*\n- Tori Paitan ramen: very delicious as well! Definitely much lighter than the tori paitan at mensho so you dont feel as terrible after eating it. Oddly enough, it has a similar flavor to the Hinodeya ramen. My only gripe is that it literally only comes with one braised chicken wing. I also don't care for the mushrooms too much. \n- Matcha tea: tasty and made from high quality matcha powder. However, it is $4, which is pretty steep considering many places offer tea for free. And no free refills.\n\nWhat I love about Hinodeya is how light but flavorful the broths are. At a good ramen place, I normally end up drinking almost all the broth and then feel terrible/bloated/sleepy afterwards. Total Snorlax status. But at Hinodeya, the portions are perfect for me (not too large or small, just right) and I'm able to devour the entire bowl and still be able to function afterwards! \n\nThey recently just released a garlic clam ramen as well as a vegan ramen with spinach noodles. I will be back, without a doubt, to try them both. ;)", "author": "Cheryl N."}

Got there pretty early, right after they seated their first round of people when they opened at 5:30. It's ramen, so the line tends to be pretty quick, especially because they don't have a very extensive menu. There is a 50% change you'll be seated at the bar or communal seating, just because of the kinds of seating they have available. The noodles here are definitely the highlight of the meal, and the broth is really light, which is nice. I did not feel like anything was too salty unlike other reviewers and already had the expectation for 1 piece of chashu, so wasn't too disappointed by anything. The bowls are not large, but there are enough toppings in it in ratio to the noodles/broth. \n\nUnfortunately, my friend found a piece of METAL at the bottom of her bowl of ramen. We pointed it out to the server who was very apologetic and it seems like it was causing a bit of a commotion, as they wanted to figure out how it got in. The manager eventually came to inspect as well, and they said they thought it was from their noodle machine. We get it, stuff happens. It's unfortunate, but at the same time, leaves a bad taste in your mouth. So we expected to be comped for a portion of our meal...ie an appetizer, or the bowl of ramen, something. We were in a bit of a rush to get to our appointments, so when the server asked us if we wanted a free dessert, we kindly declined, and when we got the bill, figured that he would probably just deduct an app. But no, we were not given a discount on anything, paid the full amount of everything because we didn't want dessert?

Don't get me wrong, service was very good, the servers paid attention to you, but the food was not that great. This location was great, hard to find parking as it's located in JapanTown. Everything else is closed at night, so there is not much to do around there. I've always been a huge fan for a place named Kaju eat's in SF that was fabulous. When we got here, we sat down and ordered one of each ramen which were $15 and $14 each. We also ordered a chicken karaage for 5 pieces for $8. The chicken came first, definitely hot and fresh. Sadly there was no pairing of spicy mayo or anything similar. Instead they gave you matcha salt which was disgusting when added on the chicken. Next came the two ramens, disappointed by the proportions, I thought maybe the taste would be amazing. We tried the clear soup ramen first, the soup was too clear, not much taste and pretty bland. There was only one piece of chashu which was very sad. Never have I seen such a thing, one piece. There was half an egg that was slowly soft cooked, and it was average. We then tried the soup for the other ramen, it was a lot more flavorful, but very small portions again. The chicken was great however. The chashu and chicken has amazing tastes, but too bad they give you such a small size. Overall the taste of the meat was great, soup was mediocre, noodles were pretty interesting, service was good. I would say this place is a 3/5 average.", "author": "Amy Y."}

There's soy-sauce base, miso-base, shio (salt) base, combined with dashi made of kelp, seafood, chicken, pork, beef, really all kids of combination.  \n\nSo no, they don't have tonkotsu here. \n\nAnd it's amazing. \n\nIn order to understand the depth of ramen culture, you have to accept.

Tori Paitan ramen comes with one braised chicken wing, while the Hinodega ramen comes one thin cut of chashu pork.

The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because no one gave us the menu for the longest time when we sat down, so we helped ourselves and grabbed the menu since we sat next to them. We ordered the shishito peppers and aburi chashu to start. Our idea was to use the chashu for extra meat in our ramen which worked out great since it had 7 pieces :) flavor was delicious! Also a fan of the shishito pepper, the sauce/seasoning for it was delicious and cooked perfectly. I super liked their chili oil with crispy garlic and onion condiment, so I put a few spoons of it into my ramen and it definitely made it better. I am usually a richer and thicker broth person but was a fan of the lighter broth for the chicken ramen. I liked it more than the house ramen. Love the chewy textured noodles too!

I've lately been leaning towards Nojo purely because you can wait indoors, you're in a nice neighborhood, and you can put your name down and leave to pass the time. Mensho's quality (which I think is slightly better), isn't worth the 1+ hour wait. I've averaged about a 20-30 minute wait at any given time at Nojo.\n\nIn comes Hinodeya! In a Japantown with good (Yamadaya) but not great (Mensho/Nojo) ramen, it's about time that there's something more unique that comes along. Taking over the space that Kotetsu sadly occupied, my wife and I were curious about this new \"dashi ramen\" place that had a long line out the door.\n\nSimilar to Mensho, you have to wait in line and cannot leave the line once you're in it. Contrary to Mensho though, we only waited about 30 minutes on a Sunday night. The common theme between the big 3 is the Tori Paitan ramen. Where Mensho and Nojo are thick, Hinodeya is thinner, more watery, but with the same taste sans the feeling of bloatness afterwards. The other things you don't get, compared to Mensho and Nojo are more meat (there is 1 solitary chicken wing), and more appetizer options (where Nojo shines). However, with that said, we also left Hinodeya spending about the same money as we would at most other ramen shops in the city. \n\nIn the end, if you ask me, Nojo still wins where they can justify the price because of the convenience, ambience, other food options, and boiling it down simply; the taste.", "author": "Jeff N."}

I'm sure many of you agree that ramen here has been underwhelming to say the least. Today however, the search has finally ended. Hinodeya is hands down the best ramen in not only SF, but in the entire bay area!\n\nMy gf and I noticed this place through Yelp and noticed it was interesting that they feature a dashi broth and that it originally originated from Japan. That's always a good sign. We came on a Monday at 4:30 PM and were first in line, but a line quickly started to form. We were seated promptly at 5 PM.\n\nWe ordered:\nHinodeya Ramen: If the ramen is named after the restaurant, you have to give it a try. This featured their lighter dashi broth. The broth is definitely different from the usual Tonkotsu broths that are so common nowadays, but while it was lighter, it was still packed with tons of flavor. The noodles were cooked al dante and had the perfect chewiness. The bowl was also packed with green onions, bamboo, a half soft-boiled egg, and a melt in your mouth fatty piece of cha shu pork. The combination of the ingredients, broth, and noodles created a perfect bowl of ramen. My only complaint was that my bowl came out warm and wasn't piping hot.\nTori Paitan: This was perhaps even better than the Hinodeya Ramen. This bowl came out piping hot and the broth was FINALLY on point. All the other places that featured Tori Paitan including Totto in New York, Nojo, and Mensho were all either too grainy, too thick/heavy, and too salty. This broth however, was the perfect creaminess while packing tons of flavor but also not being too overwhelming. The braised chicken wing was so tender and literally melted in my mouth as it fell off the bone. The noodles were of course cooked perfectly and soaked the flavor of the broth. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The only complaint was that the portion was slightly smaller. I want more!\nKaraage: Traditional Japanese deep fried chicken. The chicken was crispy on the outside but definitely could've been a bit more crispy. The inside was very tender however and the mix of lemon and matcha salt was a great combination.\n\nOverall, I'm so happy to have finally found the best ramen in not just SF, but the entire bay area.

We had the local San Francisco sake and our waiter gave us the background on San Francisco's first sake company.

The service was great, especially with the host being very attentive. \n\nWe ordered the fried oysters and chicken karaage as starters and our respective bowls of ramen. Tell me why the appetizers came mid way after we were finished with our bowls of ramen? Pet Peeve! Why would you bother calling them appetizers if they will come during the main meal?\n\nThe fried oysters weren't anything special, nothing unique. The chicken karaage, however, was delicious. The batter on it didn't feel like a heavy batter. It was almost as if they coated the karaage with chicken skin and fried it. Yum! \n\nThe tori paitan was delicious as well. It comes with a chicken wing, but I added chashu to it for more protein. The only issue I have with the ramen is that for the price, the bowl size is significantly small. Don't be fooled but the rim of the bowl as it is curved so there is definitely less in here. The broth is lighter than Mensho's version, and I kind of liked that because I love to slurp up the broth after eating the ramen. They also include a soft boiled egg (cooked perfectly), which Mensho does not have. \n\nOverall, it's a good alternative to Mensho if you don't like the heavy creamy thickness of their Tori Paitan. But in my head, Mensho's bowl is superior. You leave content and full, whereas I wasn't completely full when I left. \n\nThe food was good, so I may be back... but I think it's a matter of personal preference comparing the Tori Paitan dishes -- I'd still probably go to Mensho over Hinodeya.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

Although there is always a line, it is usually within reasonable time and the food is certainly worth the wait.

This place is an overseas extension of a ramen chain from Japan so right of the bat it's authentic. But what stood out for me more than that was the excellent customer service. I walked in at 9:52p, eight minutes before closing and was welcome, seated, and told to get my order in asap. Many other places in the same circumstance might shoo me away. But on top of it, every waitstaff in the place welcomed me in a customary Japanese respect manner. I ordered the shoyu (clear) broth ramen and some barley tea. The soup came after some minutes and looked beautiful. The broth was clear with bits of melted fat floating on top. The noodles were noticeably homemade and the egg was artistically placed near the bottom of the bowl. The chashu pork was tender, but for the price, could have had one more piece. As promised, I slurped down my meal in quick time. The barely tea was robust, unique and worth the high $4 price tag. Funny, since I sat down, 2 other parties came in, one at 9:54 and the other at 9:58p, a mere two minutes before closing. Both were welcome. Now that's customer service!

One wall of the restaurant was lined with flowers welcoming the restaurant to the community--clearly this opening was very recent, and I was surprised that so many customers eagerly were waiting on a Sunday evening. Our estimated wait time was 30 minutes during which we were thoroughly entertained by the surrounding shops and nearby Peace Plaza, which was lit up by Christmas lights.\n\nThe restaurant was simply decorated, with a traditional Japanese atmosphere that was friendly and alive with conversation. There was a standing bar for those who were waiting and wanted to grab a quick drink, a semi-open kitchen for a peek of the cooking process, and a surprising amount of sitting space--two large communal tables and about the back  of the restaurant devoted to large groups. Note that there are no tables specifically for groups of 2, if you're particularly looking for a private date night. As communicated on the menu, Hinodeya specializes in \"dashi ramen\", a style that features a lighter broth without sacrificing any of the flavor. For the soft opening, there were two ramen options: Hinodeya Ramen (traditional) and Tori Paitan (w/ chicken), of which I ordered the prior. The wait unfortunately was a little bit longer than I would like, though all was forgotten with a piping hot bowl of ramen in front of me.\n\nThe noodles were probably the best I've ever encountered, with the perfect consistency and texture--chewy, soft, thick, and on the flatter end of the ramen noodle spectrum. The both indeed was clear and thinner than most of the ramen I've had in my life (bay area born and raised), though was packed with significant flavor (a noticeable fishy bonito flavor). The one piece of chashu pork was deliciously seasoned, one half of a perfectly soft boiled ramen egg, which was amazing, and garnishes including bamboo shoots and seaweed. In the end, this was one of the few ramen bowls I've had where I did not complain of saltiness at any point throughout the meal. Unfortunately, the portion size itself was light as well and, at the end, I was craving for more.\n\nOverall: I would definitely come back for another round of this deliciously light ramen, though truth be told, the lightness of the meal left me a bit unsatisfied (perhaps next time for lunch?).", "author": "Vivian L."}

What we ordered:\n\nKarage - soggy and chicken was rubbery. Basically it was overcooked and didn't have any flavor, luckily they give you a matcha green salt. So lemon and salt is a must to eat this.\n\nCheese Royal - came with 5-6 cubes of cheese that tasted and had the same texture as the Laughing Cow cheese. Remember those small cubed ones? Exactly what it was with sesame seeds, wasabi, and the matcha salt served cold. The cheese with the wasabi and the salt was interestingly good, but not mind blowing.\n\nHinodeya ramen - dashi broth, menma, chashu (2 pieces), nori, egg, and green onions. The broth was refreshing, but luke warm which I'm never a fan of. The best part of this dish were the noodles! They remind me of the korean kalgooksoo noodles, so it's chewy and delicious! :) \n\nOverall I wouldn't go here unless I was desperate.

The city is saturated with the shops specializing in the super heavy tonkotsu/tori paitan broths.\n\nRight now, they have 2 bowls to choose from: Hinodeya (dash) and tori paitan. The dashi broth is a more delicate broth, but somehow, it's still got a lot of body and depth. The tori paitan is a lot lighter than what you might find in this city, but without sacrificing any of the flavor.\n\nThe appetizers are well done, too. Stick with nailing a few things, and leave the wide array of choices to the izakaya. The nagaimo is probably the most interesting item, and I recommend that.\n\nThere are two more soups upcoming, and I'm especially looking forward to the veggie option (sesame/soy? Yes, please!).

This place is located in the heart of SF Japantown (surprise, surprise), so if you guys are looking for a cheap and good place to eat at, this is the place to go to. The restaurant is really clean and like most traditional Japanese restaurants I've been to, all the employees greet and thank you upon entering/leaving. We were seated in one of the private rooms, and although it was cute, I felt like the customer service is ignored in those areas. We ordered the Hinodeya Ramen and Salad, Takowasa, and Tebasaki. My husband was the one who ordered the salad, which was alright. The dressing was nice, but I personally felt the arugula didn't go well with it. I love the ramen and tebasaki! The broth wasn't overpowering and all of the ingredients were well cooked. I suggest adding more ingredients as you don't get a lot... (or maybe I'm just a pig. LOL.). I loved the tebasaki and how the meat just fell off the bones cleanly. I also love the fact that they plucked any extra pieces of the feather.. because I'm really picky when it comes to things like that! It wasn't too sweet at all and feel that it was well-balanced. As for the takowasa, it wasn't anything special. It's raw octopus with overpowered wasabi... and a piece of lettuce, so I don't really suggest ordering it the first time around unless you wanted something small and light.", "author": "Kaye T."}

Small portion for $15 , I rather paid $18 at Mensho with a generous bowl.  Using stemless wine glasses to served very hot sake can burn you.  We told the server and all she said, that's what we use here.  Definitely will not go back.  Also,would be nice if they have a signed in sheet to avoid confusion.", "author": "Ed Y."}

Their noodles are thicker and slightly wider than other ramen we're used to but we loved it, imagine al dente style freshly cut noodles. No matter what time or day, prepare for at least a 20-30min wait, but def worth it. So happy to see more places pop up in Japantown.", "author": "Angela L."}

I was a little disappointed in the noodles, as they were more like udon noodles than the thinner ramen noodles that im more familiar with. Regardless, the taste was great.  The oversimplification of their menu leaves you wanting a little more options, but quality control is the outcome of it, and a good one too.", "author": "minnie l."}

I've always like dashi based soups, so having a ramen with it was great!  The broth is very flavorful and crisp.  Everything was fresh and well prepared.  The noodles had a good consistency.  I definitely want to try the other ramens when the full menu is available.   We also had an order of the karaage and fried oysters...both were also fried very nicely.  \n\nThe service was quick and the line wasn't too bad.  There was no sign-in sheet - just wait in line and the host will check in with you.  They will not seat until your entire party is present, which is fair as the restaurant is not very big (better floor plan and decor than sha la la that used to be here) and they want to keep the tables turning.

There was also a chicken based ramen, but that one tasted like chicken noodle soup on the menu of an elderly care facility (isn't that where all chicken noodle soups belong?).  Fried oyster appetizer was nicely fried but somehow did not taste much like oysters.  The ground bonito flakes on the table were nice since it was possible to increase the flavor of the ramen significantly (and it was far too bland as served).\n\nStill, this is ramen.  Exactly why am I eating this?  Certainly not because I want to.  So, this is the least offensive ramen I can recall, but the extremely limited menu means that if you come with a group and are not a ramen person yourself, you are very much out of luck.", "author": "Richard P."}

Hinendoya Ramen is simply the best ramen I have had in the West Coast. The noodle that they choose has the right consistency, the egg is cooked just right, and the broth perfect. There are currently two types of ramen. One has very thick broth (with chicken stock) and the other one light (hinendoya ramen). I suggest trying both. The chicken karage is also the best I have tried anywhere! Let's hope they can keep the quality up after the main Japanese chef returns to Japan after training the staff.", "author": "James L."}

He recommended this ramen place, and said there was one vegan option.

We shared the two main options, the Hinodeya Ramen and the Tori Paitan. They were quite good - not as rich as other nearby options, but very flavorful, and with small portions of decent toppings (I actually thought the pork wasn't great, but my date very much enjoyed the chicken wing). Some reviews mentioned the portions being small - I disagree. They were each a very filling meal without needing appetizers or desserts.\n\nOverall, I suppose I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but it just didn't live up to the hype. Maybe my taste buds aren't as refined as some, but next time I want ramen, I'm going to get a rich, salty, bucket of it for under $10.", "author": "Chris M."}

But it wasn't as long as before (when we bailed), so we stuck it out. But, I feel like a line on a Wednesday speaks volumes on how fantastic this place is. We got seated fairly quickly.  We first got the aburi chasu (flame torches pork belly)--it was 100% as advertised, full of flavor & fragrance. Usually I find green onions overly biting with an annoying after taste--not this time. Perhaps the sriracha and saffron balanced it out. Delicious start to the meal. The Kara-age was nice and tender--sounds terrible but I don't usually care about cageless/free-range because the meat is sometimes tougher. Not this time--succulent and flavorful. But, the crown jewel of my meal was the Hamaguri Ramen.   The clams were plentiful, decently sized, not tough and rubbery, not overly meaty, but not scrawny either. They were the perfect balance of salty and savory. I was a bit concerned that the broth would be too thick because the description said \"buttery dashi broth\"--nope, not al all!  We topped off the meal with the Kuro-Goma ice cream w granola...  we shared it across 3 of us so that we would walk out full & satisfied, but not sick. Good call.
