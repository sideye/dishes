I love how their happy hour has legit good deals! \n\nI knew the beer would be good (I tried one named something like Moraga and it was good!) and pretty much love all tacos. I always get their fried fish tacos. Hot crispy fish with creamy slaw.. yum. Sign me up!\n\nBut it was their wings that prompted me to write this update. HH wings are $10 and they had tamarind-chipotle sauce. I don't know what I was expecting, but not that huge bowl of wings. My eyes literally bugged out when I saw how many wings were in that bowl. A friend and I split the wings and also had some tacos, but I ate until I thought I would pop (or maybe my jeans) and we still were not done. When all was said and done, we had 10 wings left over. Yes, the quantity blew me away but it was pretty tasty too! Saucy and crispy. Sweet and savory. So yum. Can't wait to go back for another round!", "author": "Kim W."}

I made a reservation but my friend asked me to call to make sure we were close enough to the trivia host to hear everything as the space is pretty big and you can't hear trivia very well from upstairs. They were very accommodating and put us in a booth closest to the trivia area by the bar. The place was not busy when we got there around 6 but it filled up by the end of the night.\n\nThey have a taco special every Tuesday - 3 for $10 or $4 each. We got one of each kind; al pastor, chicken, beer battered fish, and a special for that night, an ahi tuna taco. They have other food and drink specials for Taco Tuesday including chips and salsa and a $7 margarita. We also got fried green beans and a \"big bowl o' wings\" to share. The food was really great! The tacos all had great flavor and the proteins were cooked perfectly. They all had a sauce that really complemented the meat well and tied them all together and kept them from being dry. That said, the tortillas were miniature, making the tacos impossible to eat normally. Not a bad problem to have, but keep it in mind if you're on a first date or something. The wings were really good! Crispy and perfectly buffalo medium, with an awesome dipping sauce. The green beans were okay, a little too heavily battered for me but still tasty.\n\nMy only complaint was the service was painfully slow. We were there for several hours for trivia, but our server kind of ignored us most of the time even when we wanted to order more drinks or get water refills, etc. Then when we wanted to pay, we had to wait around even longer. He was a nice guy, just not very attentive even though we saw him around at other tables pretty often. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back for trivia and more tacos! Just plan ahead for extra time.", "author": "Katy C."}

Sunset has an amazing cocktail menu, great food, and of course--craft beer.\n\nWe tried all of the beer, and by far our favorite was the Guava Gose. It's light with a hint of guava and tastes refreshingly sour. I also liked the Saison, which had a bit of an herbal taste. The others were pretty good too, but a little mild so they didn't stick out as much.\n\nThe food is another plus! They have bar bites, small plates, AND entrees. We tried the shishito peppers (which they give you a TON of) and the homemade french onion dip, both of which were tasty. The mac and cheese is gooey and has the perfect amount of crunch on top. The steak is incredible too--very juicy and has amazing flavor. The only reason I gave Sunset 4 stars is because I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with garlic fries and I wasn't really a fan. The pulled pork was too soggy to even hold and the garlic fries were covered in a huge mass of minced garlic. Otherwise though, the food was great.\n\nWe ordered a banana split to top it all off, and the cherry ice cream was awesome! It was the perfect end to an experience full of beer and food. Overall, I can't wait to go back, and although I probably wouldn't get the pulled pork again, I know there are tons of other great choices on this menu!", "author": "Claire C."}

Legit waited a couple minutes before anyone acknowledged us and brought us to a table. \n\nYoung female server with long brown hair arrived at our table with a pissed off attitude, no smile, and no hello. \n\nServer notifies us \"we don't have anything on the menu\". After asking a few beer related questions our server sharply replies \"we only have two out of the four beers we brew in house\". \n\nThis is a problem. How can you be a brewery with no brews? How dreadful. \n\nI tried your chicken biscuit sliders. No joke, the plate was brought out to me cold. The potatoes were cold and covered in some weird tomato gravy. The salad was lukewarm. Both sliders were dead cold. How does fried chicken make it to your customer cold? The cheese on the sliders wasn't even melted. Sad. \n\nEven worse, our server never checked up on us. Would have told her to send the plate back. \n\nMoreover, I'm completely shocked to see a $12 devils teeth breakfast sandwich on the menu. Especially when I could walk down to the source and get it for $6. Insane. \n\nLastly, being a sunset native we left your business and went to a better brewery not too far away in the sunset.

It really threw my meal off. Other than that, I really appreciated that this meal came with a generous side salad (arugula and light oily citrus dressing) and house potatoes. I think that's what really got my attention with this meal--I mean it's San Francisco and people are health conscious I guess. I really decked this meal out with a giant double bloody.

The fried chicken slider had zero pepper jack cheese and if there was a promised drizzle of maple syrup, I didn't taste it.\n\nWhile slightly disappointing, I didn't initially miss these things as this main was delicious, complete with a refreshing green salad and spicy, chunky home fries but I bet it would've hit it outta the park if the dish were complete. \n\nSad face: I guess we'll have to return for a mulligan. \n\nMy little boy gobbled up his kids' menu French toast with caramelized pear ($9 on the children's menu) and the side of bacon ($4) was cooked exactly as requested, not too crispy, and it was generously sized. \n\nEven given its expanse, the restaurant was nicely populated with hipsters, couples and families\n\n(don't let the the name containing \"brewery\" discourage you that it's not kid-friendly for brunch; it is.)\n\nGreat bar and a serious brewery - I saw the brewing tanks behind a glass wall beyond the bar- make this a great place to spend the evening with a large or small group of friends. \n\nHuge TV screens broadcasting a football game made nearly every seat the best seat in the house from either level. \n\nThe upstairs level has a great room-sized space perfect for a private party or a large group of friends wanting their own area to hang out. \n\nTwo-tops along the outside ring look down onto the main dining area, perfect for people watching on a Friday or Saturday night. \n\nHipster place in the Outer Sunset without the attitude but with all the elements that make it the next spot to really pop on the San Francisco scene.\n\nParking is extremely difficult in this neighborhood, it's a must to take Lyft or a taxi at night - and then you can also imbibe without worry. \n\nAtmosphere: 4.85\nService: 5.0\nFood: 4.50 (ding for the missing elements from the bfast slider plate)", "author": "Jennifer O."}

They're just the type of beer they are: \"Pale Ale\" and \"Irish Red\" aren't fun at all, especially when the Bay Area beer naming game is so hot. It seems like a minor thing, but I'm much more likely to enjoy a beer if it's got a fun name to go with it.\n\nThe second thing that hit me was the abundance of spirits. That's pretty uncommon for a brewery, but given that they only had a small handful of beers to choose from, I guess they have to pad out their selection somehow.\n\nAnyway, since I'm a sucker for picso, I selected the Sunset Punch cocktail. What I got was baaaasically just lemon juice with a hint of pineapple and booze. I think it was the first cocktail I've ever had that physically pained me to drink. It was so sour that each sip caused a mini heartburn on the way down. Please, do not get this, _especially_ at $14.\n\nOkay, attempt number two. Barley wine this time. It was bitter, as was expected given its 100 IBU rating, but didn't really have anything else to speak of. I just had it last night and have already completely forgotten what it tasted like. I remember not liking it much, though.\n\nThe only thing I liked about the place was the space itself. It had some verticality and felt, well, homey.

Don't get me wrong, the beers are fairly decent, whether the sour wheat, blonde, rye amber, Scottish ale, English IPA, and dry Irish stout (yes, I tasted them all), as is the food and the service, but is it really different from any other brewery that serves food, or any beer bar or restaurant out there?\n\nNot really. At the end of the day, this is the perfect place for gentrifiers who probably wouldn't bother stepping into, say, any of the solid, down-home Asian eateries in the Sunset, let alone say, actually being part of the community.

It cleared out even more after the game finished.  \n\nOnto the brews. They make their own beer. I had the porter and my friend had the ipa. Both were ok. Not the best porter I've ever had but it was still good. A little bland. That being saod, my second drink was a mean Manhattan and that was everything I could've wished for. Conclusion, their crafted beers are cool, but get a proper drink. \n\nThe food, I got the quesadilla based on the pretty servers recommendation. It was ok as well. Stuffed but no flavor. I am still surprised how much chicken they put in there. My bud went with a burger, he said it was solid. The Brussels sprouts appetizer is where it's at.

First off, who can say no to that huge plate of mac and cheese? For only $11, you get a massive bowl of ooey mac goodness with crunchy breadcrumbs on top and plenty of bacon in between. It'll burn your tongue and still leave you feeling amazing. Then, you've got their fish and chips, which comes in an even larger bowl of kennebec fries and perfectly crisp, flaky hunks of fish. Also a steal at under $15. During happy hours, you'll get their taps for $5-6, and even when it's not, drinks are still $6-7. This place is packed now though; the word is out. My only wish is that they have a larger variety of beers.

It's exactly what the neighborhood needed, the food is decent (not great, but good) & and the beer is fine.  The real complaint is around the terribly SLOW service.  We've been here maybe 6 times and without fail the hostess is nowhere to be found and seems to make guest appearances at the stand every 10 minutes or so.  While waiting for a table, we always see other people come in, wait a while for the hostess, get fed up and leave.  \nTable service is also super slow, but friendly enough. \nI guess the overall attitude is typical for the Bay Area where you get the feeling that you're inconveniencing the staff by coming in. \nI want to give 2.5 stars, but will round up to 3.", "author": "Kent F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-27", "description": "I'm not sure whether SF purists lament Sunset Reservoir Brewing Co.'s entry as gentrification as a trendy brewery restaurant encroaching upon the otherwise low-key neighborhood, or applaud it as a long-awaited addition that brings the community closer together through craft beer and gastropub-esque food.\n\nIn any case, Sunset Reservoir has exceeded my expectations. Their happy hour menu is a fairly good deal (in SF terms, meaning you can dine rather extravagantly without going broke;). I'm also impressed by their brunch, and even more impressed by how under-the-radar it is. (Everyone flocks to Outerlands for the cult-like 1-hour+ wait, culminating in overpriced small plates.) As expected for a brewery, SRBC's beer is solid, though I am more savvy on food than beer, as you can tell with the detail in this review.\n\n(Note: SRBC = Sunset Reservoir Brewing Co. It's not an acronym that rolls off the tip of the tongue, but preferable to typing it out every time)\n\n[PART I - BRUNCH REVIEW]\n\n(++) French toast - housemade beer bread, seasonal fruit ($12): This is catered towards adult beer enthusiasts, as the beer approaches the upper limit for French toast before becoming beer toast. (I can imagine kids making faces at the taste of the infused beer). On the day I went, the fruit topping consisted of baked cinnamon apples, very reminiscent of apple pies. The light sweetness and dimension of spice masterfully complemented the bitterness of the beer.\n\n(+++) Breakfast sliders - two buttermilk biscuit sliders, home fries, side salad ($12):\n*eggs, bacon, cheddar, avocado & jalapeno jelly\n*fried chicken, pepper jack & maple syrup\n(Tip: you can get one of each!) The sliders may look small, but the buttermilk biscuits are an honorable mention. After all, SRBC is owned by the same people as Devil's Teeth, and the eggs/bacon/cheddar/avo/jalapeno jelly indeed conjures blissful memories of DT's famous breakfast sandwich. SRBC adds a little flair of gastropub-like cuisine by turning them into sliders and incorporating adventurous ingredients such as jalapeno jelly and maple syrup. Additionally, the potatoes had a nice outer crisp.\n\n(++) Chilaquiles - tortilla chips, scrambled eggs, salsa tomatillo, avocado, ricotta, side salad ($10): I'm usually not a huge fan of chilaquiles, but SRBC's is surprisingly delicious and memorable. The sauce is very heavily tomato-based, interestingly similar to pasta, with an additional zesty kick from spices (I suspect paprika). I would have liked black beans in this, and I think they substituted sour cream for ricotta. Nonetheless, with the portion size and generous amount of avocado, this is a hearty and satisfying brunch plate. The accompanying salad is fresh and crisp, though they use more vinaigrette than I'd like.\n\n[PART II - HAPPY HOUR REVIEW]\n\n(+) Sliders  ($8)\n*fried chicken\n*pulled pork\nThe filling was flavorful, and the brioche bun tasted like garlic bread, wonderfully buttery but not too heavy. I would have appreciated a side salad, but I guess unhealthy savory food is the essence of happy hour.\n\n(+++) Fish and chips ($10): I was still thinking about this the next day.... (and no it wasn't due to being hungover).  I actually liked this more than the more well known fish n chips at Fish in Marin. The fish retained a moist juiciness and flavor, and the ratio of batter was just perfect for an indulgent amount of crispiness. \n\n(+) Buffalo wings - franks red hot sauce ($10): The thin fried outer coating added a nice hint of crunch, and the hot sauce is.... hot. Goes great with beer, but those who fear spiciness may want to avoid. In any case, the portion is huge. Happy hour is indeed happy here.\n\n(++) Beer flight ($12) - Good selection of diverse beers with distinct profiles. I initially discounted the cupcake pan as tacky, but it's really quite practical and the beer flight still looks rather photogenic.\n\n[OVERALL IMPRESSION]\n\nThe decor is industrial chic, with lots of wood, metal, and brick (plus succulents, of course). It features a neat high-ceiling, partial dual-level layout which reminded me of Nopa.\n\nMy first impression wasn't great: we arrived at the very tail end of happy hour, rushed to the bar, put on our puppy eyes, and asked if we may order off the happy hour menu. The bartender was gruff and terse, and it was honestly difficult to tell if he was joking. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since he was lenient granted the happy hour menu. \n\nSRBC reminds me of Social Brewery in the Inner Sunset, except I find the food here wayy better. It's more fine-tuned, more intriguing, and bigger portions. I'm definitely willing to trek out to the Outer Sunset for the noms of SRBC. \n\nSo if SRBC is owned by the same people as Devil's Teeth, does that make it gentrification as an expansion of a local business, or counter-gentrification as the successful expansion of a local business....? I'm not sure whether I'll ever understand SF.", "author": "Edna C."}

Overall, decent flight served in a muffin pan! \n\nI ended up getting their Fried Chicken that came with mashed potatoes and gravy and coleslaw ($16).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-12", "description": "Except for when people would \"TyPe LiK Dis\" (facepalm), I've never considered myself a huge stickler for proper grammar.  I certainly try my best, but I know I make my fair share of mistakes. Over the years though, it's become like nails on a chalkboard when I see people misuse there/they're/their, you're/your, and \"could/should of\" instead of \"could've/should've\".  In the spirit of that, I'm dedicating this review to something that gets misused just as much:\n\nThe Oxford Comma.\n\nBefore I get to that though, let me just say that I'm still super stoked that a place like Sunset  Reservoir Brewery has popped up in an area known more for its Asian markets and eateries than anything else.  Their beers have all been fantastic (love the Blonde Ale and Autumn Bier) and the menu is pretty solid.  Although my friends and I have only managed to order the unhealthy stuff (it's a brewery, after all), there are several \"gastropub\"-type alternatives that look rather enticing (mussels, pasta bolognese, etc.).\n\n-- HUSH PUPPIES - Onion, Corn, Jalapeno, Frisse, Sweet & Spicy Dip...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=8wo1Jj98hp-QuytWt14b7A)\nPretty meh overall.  While I didn't taste much beyond the corn and jalapeno, the flavors were good (as was the dip).  That said, the texture was a bit dry.  Plus, while they weren't exactly dense, these weren't light bites either.\n\n-- THE BURGER - Double Patty, Bacon, Cheddar, Avocado, Russian Dressing, Fries...$16\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=SxRBTIIWGEjCV-wUDLJn2w)\nThe burger was pretty beefy (two patties!), but that's about all I got from it.  Individually, the bacon, cheese, and avocado were fine.  However, the patties needed more seasoning, as they tasted purely like ground beef (that sounds odd, I know).\n\n-- FRIED CHICKEN - Boneless Chicken Thighs, Mashed Potatoes, Pork Gravy, and Coleslaw...$16\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=ewc20wiAs7n97T_50WWtqQ)\nThe best thing I've had here (I've ordered it twice).  Their quantity and size vary, but the pieces have all been juicy, crispy, and well seasoned.  The mashed potatoes were great as well; smooth and complemented well by the gravy.  The only flaw was the coleslaw - flavorful, but very heavy on the pepper the second time around.\n\n-- MAC & CHEESE BITES - Pepper Jack Cheese, Old Bay Marinara Sauce...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=JI818_PkYxVfJqcQF7tAEw)\nThe mac was tender and each bite had a good amount of flavor.  That said, I wish it was a little cheesier.  Still, it's worth trying and better than the hush puppies.  As for the marinara, it was a little watery, but the bites didn't really need it.\n\n-- FISH & CHIPS - Beer Battered Tilapia...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=-vEPoC5m7rvpoa9YbXfbxQ)\nIt's listed under \"small plates\" but the portion is HUGE!  As much as The Burger wasn't worth the money, this one was.  The tilapia was fried to the perfect crispiness yet managed to maintain its flavors.  Delicious and not hurt at all by all of the fries underneath.\n\n-- KENNEBEC FRIES with Chipotle Aioli...$5\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=GAc_GXujmqhtyhbdjDtKQw)\nQuite a heaping plate for the money.  Some of the pieces were a little soggy, but the vast majority were fine.  I wonder how they would have been if we had upgraded them to garlic fries (+$2), but the fries and aioli were good enough on their own.\n\n-- HOUSEMADE ICE CREAM...$2/scoop\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-reservoir-brewing-company-san-francisco?select=f0zKxlGgk9fg7EDQ7LiZ8g)\nMy friend and I intended to try only two flavors, but we ended up with a third (see below).  Texturally, all three were more runny than creamy, but the THIN MINT tasted the best, by far - flavorful, yet not too minty.  The BLACK SESAME needed a larger punch (plus, it tasted more like white sesame) and the GINGERBREAD might have benefited from a burnt/bitter tinge (a la \"gingerbread cookie\").\n\nAs for the Oxford Comma (or lack thereof), the menu read, \"..., Black Sesame, Gingerbread & Thin Mint\".  This, on top of the fact that it was joined by an \"&\" (like their \"mac & cheese\"), suggested that the latter two were actually a single flavor (and an interesting one at that).  However, had it been written, \"..., Black Sesame, Gingerbread, and Thin Mint\", clearly three flavors (see??  I'm not crazy!).\n\nIn any case, THREE AND A HALF STARS overall, but rounded down.  Much like with the food, service was a little hit and miss - great the first time I was here, less so the second, and okay on the third.  However, I will say the lack of the Oxford Comma left a bad taste in my mouth.  I know...kind of nitpicky of me, and perhaps a little anal, but hey, that was just my two (hundred) cents.", "author": "Mike L."}

There is so much room for growth and taproom takeover on the Sunset/Richmond side of SF, but we'll have to settle with Sunset for now.\n\nCame here during their HH time with a fellow beer lover, and we are darker beer drinkers. We were super psyched for their stout, IPA, double IPA, and a malty beer that I forgot the name of. The IPA's were my favorite, but the stout fell flat for us. It didn't have a deep creamy flavor that most stouts have, but instead it tasted kind of watered-down and had a light feel in the body. We also had some happy hour truffle fries--YUM.\n\nOther than that, the establishment itself has a few parking spots in front (for free) and if it's full you could probably park someplace close. It's Sunset! We also noticed quite a lot of stagnant flies just buzzing around and lazily staying in the air. That's not very appetizing for customers, but the good thing is that the high-ceilings and abundance of tables/space makes up for that. \n\nBartenders were very chill dudes and got the job done. This is a great place if you're looking to chill with a bigger group or even for a low-key date night. They have delicious-looking food items, and a spacious atmosphere. However, if you're going to visit just for the beer, I'd say you can definitely find better microbrews in the city.", "author": "Jodi H."}

The only possible explanation for the waitress suggesting the puddle of bullshit that they call pasta bolognese is the $5 price difference. For $18, I can get a whole delicious pizza from The Pizza Place down the street.

My friend had recommended this place, and we ended up visiting it during a Friday happy hour.  It was quite bustling, and I could see why this place would be a popular place to grab some brews and food before the dinner rush.  There's a sizable bar and seating available on both the upper and lower level, which could help if you are going out with a group of friends.\n\nI ended up trying a few of their beers, including their IPA, and I thought the beers were find though not very flavorful.  I was expecting an intense hoppiness to the IPA, but it turned out to be not as sharp as I was hoping.  My friend and I shared a half-portion of their chipotle barbecue wings, which was quite huge!  While I was impressed by the portion, I thought the wings were more on the bland side.  \n\nI would probably visit again if I was in the area looking for a happy hour spot, but I don't think I'll be clamoring to go back anytime soon.", "author": "Keith H."}

The atmosphere is great - I love the decor, the open space, the lofted second floor. I don't have kids but definitely appreciate that this is a place where you can comfortably bring them along (since there aren't many in SF).\n\nI've been super impressed with some of the food items - the eggplant and ricotta appetizer is SUPER good (especially with the house bread), the burger is solid, the fettucine pasta bolognese is BLEEPING AMAZING. It's now officially the only thing I ever want to eat before a long run. Or after. Or you know, on a Tuesday. It's also probably two meals' worth of food.\n\nSome food in the \"pretty good\" column -- the sea bass and the tacos (hit up taco tuesdays for a decent, cheap dinner). I thought the side of veggies was \"meh\" to just passable - that tasted like it came from a microwave pouch. I miss the pork shank and the shishito peppers that used to be on the menu, but since it changes seasonally maybe those will come back?\n\nBoth the fall seasonal beer and the sour wheat are favorites of mine, but I also appreciate that the taps rotate and they have a good variety. And seriously, the flights are adorable and so worth the $10. \n\nMy one - and biggest - complaint is the service. 2/3 times I've been here, I've had really inexperienced, really mediocre/borderline bad service. The servers don't seem trained on greeting, check-ins, refills, pacing, or really much about being a server. They seem busy and rushed.

Wings were meaty, the pizza is excellent with the best crust in San Francisco and the fish and chips were tasty and not greasy.    \n\nBeer and Bar Service:  the beer needs work.   The style is fine and flavorful but they have been out of my first and second choice both times.   The brew master needs to get his head in the game and have his taps full and with a good variety (not everyone loves a hoppy beer).  Speed in making drinks needs to improve as my spices margarita took 20 minutes.  \n\nService:  as stated this was only my second visit and the first time was a month ago.   The server said Welcome Back (not bad since we are pretty average people) and when our food came out a little late.   He was attentive and pleasant.  The two hostesses were also friendly along with the rest of the staff.   \n\nFinally the dessert.  We had a great brownie 4 weeks ago and was very happy.

As I approached the front door I had to check the address again because I thought the place was empty from the outside. After I looked around and noticed the menu in the window I proceeded on in. I thought because it was lunch time there would be a lot of people inside but there were only 4 or 5 customers seated inside. I was getting an order to go so I made by way over to the bar area.\n\nThe young lady at the bar was extremely nice and cordial. That was much appreciated. She greeted me and handed me a menu and gave me a few minutes to decide on my order. As I looked over the menu I realized that the food items being offered were great but the prices are a bit ridiculous. In this being my first time here I went on ahead and placed my order to see if the quality matches the price. After I placed my order I took time to scope out this place. \n\nThe design of this place is very nice. The ceiling is high and I believe that there is upstairs seating as well. The lighting is nice and not too bright which provides a very relaxing atmosphere. There is also some seating near the entrance by the windows which is a very nice touch.\n\nThe bar area is amazing. I have been to enough dive bars to know that their shelves are just infested with whatever bottles they can find but this place has a clean bar area! When I say \"clean\" I mean thoroughly clean and probably dust free as well! That was the lingering impression that I got from this place. They are big on keeping this place keep and in \"tip top shape\". \n\nI was definitely itching for some beer while I was here but I did not have time to do that today. In reviewing the selection on the wall and having visited the website before coming here I knew that I wanted to grab a pint or at least try their sampler of beers. Oh well, next time I will make sure to do that. \n\nThe wait for my food took roughly 10 minutes or so and then I was off. I headed straight home after getting my food. The smell of the food filled my car and that was a GOOD thing!! \n\nOnce I got home it was time to EAT! I opened the box and witnessed the \"glory\" of my food. Not bad, the burger seemed a bit small but it looked really good.\n\nThe burger, it was well cooked and the condiments were great. The flavor and taste was perfect but I wish that the patties were thicker! The fries were just as good. The seasoning of the fries was a nice touch, much appreciated! This meal was a complete and utter SUCCESS! Not thrilled about the the cost.

It should not have taken this long. They told us we could drink at the bar, which we did and kept our tab open, but they didn't tell us that we had to close our tab before we could sit at our table! That would have been nice to know and sped up the process since the bartenders seemed to be avoiding ALL customers  eye contact.. We basically had to yell at them to get their attention to close out (Which is rude, and I don't like doing).\n\nThe food? Looked good! We werre very excited. When we got our burgers though.. we were very disappointed. To be honest, it tasted like an in n out double double... Not worth $16. I am sorry, but even with the small amount of bacon, it isnt. \n\nSitting next to the kitchen we noticed that every plate of the same item coming out was different, some had more meat, some had more sides, they weren't all the same. Which is not fair to customers expecting the same thing as someone else.\n\nThe oysters, YUM! So good! But we only got 3.. for $14. They weren't THAT good. And how are you supposed to split 3 oysters? Typically, people go out in groups of even numbers... Am I wrong?\n\nAt the table, from the time we sat down and ordered to we got our food, another 45 min. To top it all off, our waiter, lost my credit card. 15 frantic minutes later he found it. I feel bad because he felt really bad, but take a breath, pull it together, you can do it.\n\nOne plus? A pint was only $6.\n\nI understand that they JUST opened.

It's such a breath of fresh air in comparison to the usual places you find in the Sunset District, as a youthful, trendy place for solid food and less-solid drinks. \n\nThe kicker for me was just not liking the beers. The darker beers were too heavy, and the lighter beers just tasted off to me. And how can a girl give a brewing company a rave review if the brews they brew just aren't that good?\n\nOVERALL.\n+ Well designed interior that stands out well in the Sunset\n+ Solid food and HH menu (especially their garlic fries!)\n~ Nice service but slow, and it's difficult to flag down servers when needed\n- Pretty un-spectacular beers across the board\n\nIt's a nice enough place to hang out at, and I'd still happily go back for lunch and some cocktails, but beer is not what you should be looking for here.", "author": "Claire S."}

Nice to have a brewpub there, in the outer Sunset, but they need to step it up.\n\nThe service was very slow despite not being busy on a Sun morning. The biscuit sliders were decent in concept, but half hearted in execution and not enough food for the price charged. Making matters worse, mine weren't hot when served; moreover half our party was served and then we had to wait another 5-10 minutes for the other half to get their food.\n\nI ordered the black lager off the menu but received a beer that was more like a porter, and a stout one at that. When I asked about, the server said, \"Oh yeah our new brewer decided to change it to porter because it seems more like a porter.\" Maybe mention that when I make the order? And update your menu.\n\nAnother favorite moment in service is when our server was taxed to put down a plate of food because of uncleared plates & glasses, then walked away leaving them there. clap_emoji.jpg\n\nThe atmosphere is OK, but hampered by the brutal acoustics.\n\nThey'll get by because there's not much else that side of 19th Ave to scratch a brewpub itch, but there's nothing here to recommend.", "author": "Striddy B."}

We came in during their happy hour times which are from 3-6pm I believe. We were greeted right away by the bartender, he informed us we could seat anywhere and the server will help us out. (If you want the upstairs seating overlooking the ground level, inform the workers first before heading up or else they won't know and won't come up to serve) \n\nWe headed to a booth and immediately the server walks by and ask if we are doing water all around, yes we gestured and off he goes. I really like this because regardless at a sit down restaurant is always like water by my side. Like any other he asked if we like anything other than water when he returns and if we had any questions with the menu. Then menu is simple and to the point. Myself, I had the fish and chips and their beer flight which allows you to enjoy three types of beer they provide. \n\nFood wise the meal was superb!! It was a very large portion but it's what you pay for. Prices are normal for their portion size. The fish and chips came with malt vinegar, tater sauce and ketchup for the chips. Very flavorful and fish packed! Loved it! The beer flight is a real kicker. I love beer and alcohol itself hehe but some reason the beer had a kick. By the time my flight was done I had a good buzz.

It reminds me SO much like Nopa in the Panhandle with their printed out menu that looks like the selections change based on the season and what is available. Their menu consists of bar food with a variety of small bites and large plates. This review is based on the experience of two girls drinking a beer each, overall ambiance, and service.\n\nOnce greeted at the door, we found a table by the bars and seated ourselves. I had to grab menus from the bartender at the front since no one was really tending to the tables in the area we were in. My girlfriend and I weren't planning on getting any food since we just had dinner elsewhere, but it didn't seem like there was much hype on the food selection (from Yelp, at least). The beer here add no frills; it's all pretty standard stuff you can find at your favorite local brewery. I think I'm someone who likes to try unique stuff that a place is known for, but here I feel it is a place for people who stick with something simple/stay in their comfort zone. \n\nI would come back because of its convenience and how there are barely any breweries in the middle-outer sunset, but it is a chill spot for a catch-up or date.", "author": "Kathleen S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-21", "description": "The Sunset needed a spot like Sunset Reservoir Brewing Co. Among the many Chinese eateries along Noriega lies this cute, upscale-looking brew house. I met my girl Becca last week for some gabbing, a drink, and something yummy to eat and was impressed with the look of the place: all grey wood, very sleek and clean, cool lighting, TVs, lots of beers on tap.\n\nSo, why the 3 star review, Crys? Well I'll tell ya! I love sour beer ever since a trip to Portland I took earlier this year. My tastebuds know what they're looking for and they get very excited at the prospect of a nice sour caressing them ever so gently. So when I spotted the Sour House Wheat, my 'buds started doing their happy dance. Sadly though, this sour was not sour in the least. It tasted just like any old wheat beer. I suppose it's my bad because I didn't ask to taste it or inquire about how sour it was going to be, but sadly this beer was not a homerun for me.\n\nWe ordered the Fried Mac n Cheese Balls with Marinara dipping sauce for our appetizer and I must say they were pretty good. Like, I would eat a plate of them right now if they were put in front of me. The outer seasoning was really tasty, crispy, and the sauce offered a nice tomato offset to the rich cheese and pasta, like tomato soup to grilled cheese. We both got The Burger for our main and again, I was not impressed. The double patties were really small and hard to bite into. I asked for a medium cook and they were well-done and dry. \n\nService was sub-par as well. Our waitress was young, and I get it, I've been there, you lose track of what you're doing or what people ask for, but we only saw our waitress once at the beginning of our meal to take our order and the rest of the time we had to flag down busboys for anything else we wanted.

The setting here is extremely modern and elegant with a very attractive long wooden bar.  This place has a very similar feel to the other brewery in the Sunset. Social Kitchen and Brewery. The menu looks pretty enticing, but we were here only to try a couple beers so I'll have to come back and update my review. I'll also have to come back because I hear they are now working with a new brewmaster. With that said, the beer offerings here from the prior brewing team are pretty \"meh.\" Nothing on the list is that approachable. Alt Bier, Sour Wheat, 2 stouts, a brown ale and an English IPA.  I told my pal who works at Speakeasy about my experience at SRBC and he too scratched his head when I told him about the available beers. I tried a half pint of the English IPA which was actually pretty tasty. I also sampled the brown ale and the Alt. I don't think I would order a pint of either of these two. My buddy agreed with me, and he ordered Makers on the rocks. When someone who came to your brewery to have beer ends up with a Makers, you know there's a problem with your beer list.

One of my friends asked her what the shot of the day was and she said \"uh idono\" and stood there. Horrible sales skills. After that horrible exchange we proceeded to order and everything was mediocre after that. Someone got a little to happy with the topping for the broccoli, the toasted nuts weren't seasoned at all. From everyone else at the table the Mac n cheese, wings, and greenbeans were good. Once she dropped off the bill we put three cards down and how much we wanted charged to each card. She told us \"I can only do 2 cards.\" I'd believe that but last time we visited they ran 3 cards for us, on top of that I serve tables myself and inform the guests of how many cards are allowed. If they write for me how much they want charged on each card it's not an issue, splitting items is inconvenient which I understand and that's not what we were doing.

One star for the nice server.\n\nThe beer flight is a total of two pints at the most and 12 bux.  We ordered a few pints after the flight and the bartender short poured  the pints (see photo).  A short pour in a brewery is like a white glove in the face in Paris.  Someone has got to go after an action like this.  It wasn't like the beer was not pouring right either.  It was just short.  They were not busy at the bar either.  OUCH!  \n\nThe food was pretty bad.  Shishito peppers were good.  Flash fried and sprinkled with good salt served with a tiny tin cup of ranch dressing.   That was the highlight of our meal.\n\nPoke was bland and way overpriced.  They should just go get it from Costco or Safeway daily and have the floor manager/runner sling it to order.  \n\nRice balls were worse than they sound.   Crunchy undercooked rice inside.  Bland and kinda gross overall.  Don't get me wrong.  Ill eat a chicken mcnugget and not bitch but this ball was bad.  Mushy from the bad recipe.  Greasy from the deep fryer.  Small portion with a high ticket price.  Nasty old tasting tomato sauce on the side.  Bummer.  Arugula on the plate but there is a third sauce on that that does not help anything on the plate.  Four balls for like 13 bux.  Ouch.\n\n13 bux for a caesar salad in a brew pub is like a 20 dollar bud light in a strip club.  The salad better better be off the hook.  This one is once again not as good as Costco or Safeway.  The lettuce is cut real thin.  The dressing is light and bland.  No salt pepper on the table let alone offered by the staff fresh cracked.  Total rip off.  \n\nI had to get an entree to see how that would go so I opted for the Half chicken.   Its a small leg and thigh and a wing in breast.  Dry breast.  Weird kind of sweet bbq like sauce on the chicken as a glaze.  I had fries instead of the celery root puree since the server said it was pretty gross.  The fries were not seasoned and the plate overall was bad.  Veg was cooked well but that was it.  20 bucks for that one.  The plate was warm so that was cool.  Once again I would have been happier with a reheated half chicken from Costco's hot box.  \n\nThis pub has so much potential.  It reminds me of how Beach Chalet was when they first opened.  Total CRAP food.  It took them years to get it together and hopefully these guys will too.\n\nI will go back for beer maybe.  Forget about the food.  No real chef here.

They only have 6 kinds of brews available-which is how many beers fit on a flight....any real brewery has 10+ selection of beers which is why flights are created so you can pick and choose which beers to have...having only 6 beers defeats the whole purpose of a flight because there's nothing to choose.\n\nIf this place steps up their beer game it can definitely be a huge success because the food here is really high quality, which is unusual for a brewery. My friends had the fish-chips, chicken wings, and mac-n-cheese. All delicious and well portioned.\nOur bill for 4 came out at 100. Which is a bit pricey for the sunset but worth it honestly.", "author": "Yevgeniy V."}

One said the reason as to why was because they did not want to disrupt those customers that were not in to watch the game. Another said that he had no idea why the sound wasn't switched on, and even explained that several tables had left because of their refusal to do so. \n\nThe managers of this establishment are inconsiderate of their customers' best interests.

I would go back for it.

Anyways, I feel like small plates should be a given if 2 people ordered 2 starter dishes...but maybe it's just me and I just like to share. \n\nThe fries were good, but would've been better if I got my ketchup before we finished half the fries. \n\nNon-alcoholic Drinks - I ordered a glass of orange juice since I had work in a couple of hours. There was clearly more than just orange juice in there since it was a bit fizzy and bubbly and alcoholic tasting. \n\nAlcoholic drinks - I highly recommend your staff to ask for IDs when people place an order for an alcoholic drink especially since minors are allowed to come in.

You know when you order a burger and it doesn't come already assembled? They put the toppings on the side so you can put on whichever veggies you like.

I requested medium rare, which usually yields medium and I'm okay with that. What do I get? Well done. Why does this happen so much in San Francisco? Maybe they noticed I was some Yelp food critic like on South Park and wanted to get my hopes up about a 145\u00ba burger for the lolz.\n\nThe fries were good, though.\n\nNow for the beer. I got the sampler which came with the Sour Wheat, Rye Amber, English IPA, Alt Bier, Dry Irish Stout, and Russian Imperial Stout.

I was mostly disappointed with the English IPA because it was way too cloudy plus I think the style was a bit off; I feel like the hops they used were unorthodox for a traditional English IPA.\n\nIf the food here gets better I could see myself coming back, but from reading the other reviews it doesn't seem like much has changed.

Couldn't get a drink at the bar because it was that crowded.  Ambiance is hip. Ordered cocktails when we finally sat at our table but it came after our appetizers; something about being backed up.  Peppers and peach/spinach salad were good.  My partner and I always share our dishes. I had the fish & chips w/garlic fries and he had the portobello mushrooms w/regular fries; both were just ok. Fish looked burnt but maybe it was dark beer used for the beer batter. It didn't taste burnt but it was just ok.  Both fries tasted like it was sitting - soggy and a bit hard. The portobello burger was ok too.  I'm not sure I'll come back but to support a local restaurant in the Sunset.", "author": "Becca D."}

We loved it - has a cool feel (wood/metal/very industrial almost farm house like), good food & plentiful beer options. The area upstairs is great for large parties. We used to make this a weekly stop. But recently things have changed and I won't be going back.\n\nWord is, there is a new brewmaster.My husband loves beer - they had a big selection until recently but now they only have 4 selections. I'm gluten sensitive so I can't drink beer but I loved their cider. They no longer have cider. \n\nThere is also a new chef. Some of my family's favorite items are no longer offered - such as the warm pretzels. Thankfully they kept the fried chicken - my family LOVES the fried chicken! Also, their cole slaw is delicious as is their mashed potatoes (hold the gravy, gluten free-ers!)\n\nUnfortunately, the gluten free options I enjoyed such as the Risotto and the Sauteed Greens (with bacon, shallots & mushrooms) are no more. The options for me now are salad, a bunless burger (which is very greasy and is always served without any condiments), a roasted half-chicken. Not too much variety. \n\nThe waitstaff is drastically under-educated about the needs of gluten sensitive customers. It would do the ownership some good to notate items on the menu that are gluten free or can be made gluten free, to spare the waitstaff the million questions & spare the customer a \"let's hope for the best!\" The waitstaff is quick to say if something has gluten but they don't always connect the dots with the shared fryers and don't offer ways items could be served gluten free.  I was reassured a few times that their fries and their new brussell sprouts are gluten free, only they aren't - they are fried in the same oil as their flour foods. I knew I had felt off after consuming these, just wasn't sure if it was due to other reasons. \n\nWater is served in small (like 4oz) glasses, which can be annoying if you aren't drinking beer - you have to wait for someone to notice and come by to fill it.\n\nI won't be returning to SRBC as it seems the recent changes with menu & beer selection make the visit more cumbersome than enjoyable.", "author": "j m."}

It's always nice to see the Sunset get some shiny new spots to hang out. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, and sat right down. It's probably a good idea to try the place on an off time, or to make a reservation. I hear they're pretty busy still. \n\nThe beer flight was refreshing, and the pours were decent. The sour wheat and maibock were my personal favorites. They now have 6 beers on tap. \n\nThe wife's Bloody Mary was stiff, and super flavorful. \n\nOn to the food:\n\nFried Chicken Sando - the chicken was perfectly fried and juicy, and we added a fried egg for a brunchy punch. \n\nPortabello Mushroom Sando - there were a few very tiny portobello mushrooms inside, and it left me wishing they had used a large portobello mushroom instead. There was too much bread in relation to the filling. \n\nAlso, on the menu they list that they serve the sandwiches with salad, and it's $2 extra to add fries, which I did. But when the sandwich arrived, I received fries -- but no salad. They should change the wording on the menu to say \"Substitute Fries\" instead of \"Add Fries\" so there isn't any confusion. \n\nGreen Posole - we originally ordered the green Posole, but the kitchen changed it to Red Posole. The broth was savory, and the chickpeas and hominy were tender. Solid dish. \n\nCajun Gulf Prawns saut\u00e9ed in Beer - the prawns were awesome, and left with the heads on so we could suck the juice out. Amazing! The sauce was a bit on the bitter side from the beer, but didn't kill the dish. It was a bit pricy though, at $18 for only 5 prawns. \n\nWhisky Caramel Pot De Creme with Candied Peanuts - OMG!!!!! This was so amazingly delicious, I could eat a whole trough of this stuff. \n\n\nThe service was attentive, and our server was nice and informative. \n\nOverall a solid experience, albeit with a few hiccups.

They also didnt have the desserts that are one their website menu either. My daughter was bummed out.  I don't think I will return. There are other places", "author": "Diana G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-12", "description": "The Sunset really needed a place like the SRBC.  In this district inundated with Asian mom and pop eateries and shops, there is a huge void for a hip brewery hangout spot.  The new neighborhood watering hole caught a lot of attention since it's opening, and pretty much everyone and their mama flocked to check out the new place.  Having replaced the space of an old grocery store, SRBC remodeled the building into a nice looking open concept bar and restaurant spanning two floors.  They do have the beer brewing on site and you can see the large beer vats.  But - as other yelpers mentioned, there are definitely kinks that need to be worked out.   \n\nOur group of friends met up with a reservation via Yelp Seatme for a late dinner/snack/dessert/brew.  We wanted to make a ressie since other friends of ours mentioned having to wait 1.5 hours for a table on a separate occasion.  The bar area is nice and there's plenty of seating on both floors.  It's nice that they have a huge projector to show the SF Giants and Warriors games on the huge wall above the bar.  I can see this place getting really packed come playoff time.  We didn't have any problem getting seated upstairs promptly.  The upstairs area seems to be used for larger groups and probably could be rented out for parties since there is another small bar up there too.  It wasn't open that evening though.  \n\nWe were all impressed by the ambiance and reveled in the novelty of SRBC for the first few minutes.  After that, a rather disappointing experience ensued.  Our server was a delightful young lady but she was a complete amateur waitress.  She would disappear for long periods of time and no one checked on us for 20-30-60 minutes intervals.  We were there for a good amount of time but it seemed really difficult to get any type of service.   The waitress didn't actually bring us any waters until a whole hour after we ordered beers.  When we did order some food, she didn't bring us any small plates until after the food arrived.  A few people at our table ordered the beer flight and someone came to drop them off without any explanation of what was what.  It wasn't until much later that our waitress finally came to check on us and we had to ask her to point out the different types of beers.  The wait staff was very disorganized at SRBC and even servers who brought out the food didn't know which tables to bring them to.  \n\nWhat was a huge let down was actually the beer itself.  I ordered their Irish stout since that's my favorite type of beer.  I did get try each of the beers from other half's flight and didn't think any of them were great.  I'm not a huge beer drinker but I think I know a good brew.  The overall consensus at our table was that all the beer were just mediocre.  I thought a few tasted watered down and flat.  Flights are $10 and pints are $6.  Reasonably priced but there sure are less expensive breweries around the city.     \n\nA few of our friends ordered the wings and fries to nosh on.  I didn't try any of the food but I did order the bread pudding with strawberry ice cream ($8).  It was just OK.  It tasted like a home cook could have made it....not a culinary/pastry chef.  Another friend ordered the pork chop and he said it was good.  I thought the items on the menu were a but pricey for what they were.

It's close to my house, gorgeous on the inside, and the menu looked interesting on paper. Me and a girlfriend went last night to check it out thinking that some of the opening kinks would have been worked out by now.  \n\nNow I understand that this is a brewery, but when you have a full bar and a specialty cocktail list, you should be able to make a decent drink. The first bartender we had was really sweet but made a pretty terrible margarita. He started by giving us brunch menus and we wanted the spicy margaritas, but when we ordered them he explained that he gave us the wrong menu and we settled on normal ones.... Overly sweet, not at all balanced, and we even upgraded the tequila, but I could not taste it at all. \n\nThen we ordered some food - the burger and the meat and cheese plate to share. The burger was pretty delicious - juicy, flavorful, nice soft bun. The fries were really good too, but we had to ask for ketchup twice. The meat/cheese plate was a sad sad portrayal. Two cheeses, both superrrrr hard (bleu cheese should not be that hard) and two cured meats that were never explained to us. The \"accruements\" were cornichons and two hard pieces of toast - no sweet jam, figs, nuts... nothing. \n\nWe picked at the food and chatted for a while with empty glasses, and waiting probably 25 mins before finally flagging someone down to order more drinks. We decided on Moscow Mules, and the bartender asked whether we wanted traditional ones or their specialty ones. We asked what the specialty one was which caught him very off guard and he had to go get a menu to see what actually was special about it. He ended up giving us vodka sodas with lime in copper mugs. \n\nOverall these are kind of nit picky things to complain about, I understand that. But when you have 3 bartenders and a bar back behind the bar and are still receiving little to no service, that doesn't sit right with me (esp when paying $100.00 between 2 people). I do hope that they get it together because this has great potential for a neighborhood go-to spot.

I remember walking in the first weekend they opened and being pretty underwhelmed. But now that the dust has settled it's one of my favorite places in the Sunset.  \n\n        Beer & Drinks: (4/5) Studies have shown that in SF a new brewery opens roughly every 80 seconds * (*no actual data was collected in the making of this study) so the beer has to be special to make a splash.  Make sure to get the flight if you've not tried any of their homebrews; I also enjoy that the glasses come in a clever muffin tin configuration.  The stars of the show in my eyes were the Double IPA and Dry Irish Stout. The sour wheat has a strong sourdough bread aftertaste, this may seem weird but I enjoyed it.  Also Sunset Reservoir has a good mix of cocktails on their menu if beer is not your thing. The Elderhound and Buffalo Mule were both fantastic and well worth the purchase.\n\n    Food: (4/5)  I've had a smattering of the sides and one or two of the dinners.  By far I think you get the best deal by getting the Sunset Burger with Fries.  In classic California fashion it has avocado on top as well as bacon, both of which have been proven to help you age slower.  The fired chicken thighs are also not to be missed or the bowl of wings. NOTE - the bowl of wings contains roughly 100,000 wings. Two friends and myself had trouble finishing the bowl it was so full.\n\nSetting: (4/5) Ive been told that the previous tenant of Sunset Reservoir's current location was some type of market and the space is big enough that i believe it.  The ceilings are high and vaulted with reclaimed wood and metal making up the majority of the decor.  They also have two TV's typically playing whatever Bay Area team is currently kicking butt near the bar and a second floor for larger parties.\n\nAll in all a solid place to go for a beer and grab a bite.", "author": "Ryan F."}

The beer was pretty decent, but nothing I would wait in a Soviet bread line for.\n\nSuggestions: \n\n-Staff: If you make eye contact with guests coming through the door, greet said guests.\n\n-Bartender: When dealing with inquisitive customers asking about the beer tasting flight, don't hand them a flight tasting half-sheet, tell them the information is there, and then walk off to help someone else. \nTell them the information is on the halfsheet, but also include something along the lines of, \"We're real busy right now, but feel free come back to me with any questions you may have. The staff can also help you as available.\"\n\n-Include a chalkboard or display of beer options. It'd also be good to have something letting guests know if bottled beer is avaliable for purchase, or if you can get a growler filled.\n\n-Protect your menus in sleeves, or laminate them--it's kind of gross to handle a sheet with wet spots.\n\n-Have staff make one group announcement for last call/finish drinks. Having a guy selectively go around telling some people they need to finish their drinks, while others go about sipping freely gives the wrong impression.\n\nOverall, I'm really hoping SRBC works the kinks out in time. The venue is lovely, and I'd love to see success with their family-friendly concept. Hopefully service improves and stays away from being labeled a douchey pretentious hipster destination. We already have SoPac Brewery in the Mission for that nonsense.", "author": "Sam W."}

It has a beautiful, large, hip ambience. However, they have a lot of growing pains to iron out! I'd be interested in coming back in a month or two to see if they've ironed out some of the kinks. \n\nThe house-brewed beer selection is really great. Some breweries totally miss making any sort of impression but it's totally worth it and a reasonable price. ($10 for a flight of 5).\n\nThe pickled vegetables under 'snacks' aren't pickled. At all. It's a combo of peppers, cauliflower, and jalapeno slices that have maybe been marinated in oil... ?\n\nOf the other dishes our group ordered, the mussels were the best on the menu, and still that's kind of a stretch. The addition of chorizo was OK, but kind of strange. Less is more! \n\nThe burger has no veggie option, which is a bummer! Our friends ordered a burger without the patty, and I'll just say it was not good. Gotta get on that veggie burger game. \n\nAll in all, I think the space is great and the beer selection is awesome. I won't be ordering food here for awhile, and hope they simplify it/put out a stronger menu. Still a great spot to hang, and you should still check it out if you're on the fence.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Julianne M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-30", "description": "Thank god this brewery opened up! I read several of the reviews on Yelp and to be honest I'm really surprised about many of the complaints, this place is a blessing to the Sunset, the Sunset is boring and only full of Asian restaurants to offer. The price is too expensive??? Reallyy? What world do you come from, you live in San Francisco. Go to McDonalds or BJ's and get your burger if you want something cheaper, every brewery I have been to of this class has relatively the same prices.\n\nThis place is working out the kinks, which is understandable for it being so brand new.  The owner is the same person that runs Devil's Teeth bakery, which is another top notch place in the sunset for pastries, your morning coffee, and one of the best egg sandwiches I've every had.  So she definitely knows what she's doing in terms of food.\n\nI've had breakfast, appetizers, and a burger and beer, so my review will be based on those items.\n\nBreakfast:\nI had the chilaquiles, the clams, a pambaso and a sopa con puerco.  Chilaquiles were delicious, but they were my first to try so I can't compare to anything else in life, but they were solid.  The clams were delicious and had tons of flavor.  The pambaso was probably my favorite, it had chicken and salsa verde, the bread it came with was extremely savory and made that dish for me, as I am a bread guy (even though I wouldn't describe the dish as extremely bready).  The frijoles con puerco was very good, the pork was a little tough, but still very flavorful\n\nAppetizers:\nHad the mussells with chorizo...super good! Great flavor, and the chorizo was money!!!!!\nAlso had the rabbit rillettes with frisee, bacon, redcabbage jam... My wife and I split this, I was suprirsed at how good the portions were, we were able to spread the red cabbage jam on crostinis and top it with the rabbit and bacon, my favorite appetizer, red cabbage jam was delicious and I had just come somewhere from having organic bacon, and was surprised at how flavorful this bacon was, really good dish.\n\nBurger:\nThe sunset burger was solid, and came with a healthy portion of fries.  Since the owner is such a creative baker, I'm waiting for her to come out with some kind of special ketchup for the fries (wink wink), but I will wait for that, either way solid burger and fries.\n\nBeer:\nHad the flight of beers just to see what I would like.  It really depend what you like as far as beer, I'm more of an IPA guy, and surprisingly their IPA wasn't my favorite, not to say it was bad, I interestingly liked the Blond Ale over the IPA, typically Blondes are too light for me, but this was to me a little more medium bodied and delicious.  Also surprising for me was the Dry Irish Stout, I hate Guiness, as I think it's so flat and one note, but this beer I actually liked even though I'd compare it to a Guiness, the only difference was it had this delicious coffee liquor kind of taste, which was quite enjoyable.  \n\nAtmosphere/KIds/Family:\nThe overall atmosphere is nice and wide and spacious, all the staff are super accommodating even though many are still learning the menu and getting acquainted with the new place.  I brought my 1 year old here as well, and it was very easy on the family, didn't have that bar rowdy kind of environment, a family could easily bring their kids (son loved the chorizo and pamboso as well :)).", "author": "Gina A."}

Sunset Reservoir Brewing Company has both obvious room for improvement and strong, staying potential in the neighborhood.\n \nSunset Reservoir's in-house brews are the highlight of its menu. The Blond Ale is like the crisp breath of fresh air that is desperately needed after emerging from a crowded movie theater - it uplifts and revitalizes the drinker from not only the doldrums of a workday, but also the drowsiness threatened by the food on hand. Meanwhile, the Irish Stout is like swimming in an unlit swimming pool in the dead of night and suddenly coming upon a treasure chest - the darkly rich and smooth stout gives way to a stunning, coffee aftertaste.\n \nThe Sunset Burger presents a glaring plot hole in an otherwise wonderfully produced film. The patty is well-seasoned, bacon crisply fried, and dressing thoroughly enriching, but unfortunately, the state of the bun cannot be ignored. Whether due to chef's purpose or oversight attributed to unrehearsed procedures, the brioche bun that is actually still flavorful is dreadfully dry. Despite attempting willful ignorance to avoid seeming petty for sending the burger back to the kitchen over such a detail, the crumbly and moisture-robbing bread was resoundingly prominent in each bite. The medium-cut fries are a satisfying, crispy accompaniment.\n \nThe Pasta Bolognese is fuller than a preschooler's backpack - teeming with sausage, cheese, and flavor. Its sauce is the perfect pasta manager, striking an ideal balance in having its fingerprints on all the moving parts, while not becoming domineering in any aspect. The papardelle pliably envelops nearby sausage and cheese, automatically generating a composite bite in each forkful.\n \nThe service is attentive and polite, never straying far from empty water bottles or tables yet to order, while the high ceilings and woody d\u00e9cor create the sense of dining in a luxurious cabin. Sunset Reservoir is off to a running start, but its pricier offerings demand some improvement.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I'm beside myself with happiness at having a nearby spot like this\n\nJust enjoyed the extra pale ale and the double IPA. Both solid. The extra pale was light, minimal hops, refreshing. The double IPA was cloudy, delicious, well balanced, and tasted a little like Racer 5. Not sure why other people are saying they couldn't taste the hops. My husband and I home brew IPAs and drink all the usual suspects and it has just the amount of hops you would expect. \n\nWe also had the chilaquiles. Yummy, with lots of egg and tomato.

The last time i ate there, I wasn't sure what happened to the calamari appetizer that I've ordered every time.  That night, there was only a few calamari pieces on top of a salad of cucumber and turnip slices and coleslaw.  And strangely enough, squid ink.  We ordered calamari, not squid ink cole slaw salad.  Very disappointing.  Their fried chicken;  don't bother.  It was the first time i ordered it and it was flattened pieces of chicken that was breaded and fried.  The chicken pieces were very thin, thinner that one side of the fried batter that coated it.  The mashed potatoes were ok, but they need to skip that soupy gravy that sits atop it.  The coleslaw was good.   The pizza:  my friend ordered it and it came out piping hot.  Except that the crust was still doughy and raw underneath.  It went back into the kitchen to go in the oven a little longer.  And came out with the bottom a bit burnt.  The guy came out from the kitchen and offered to make a new one and that one came out the way it was supposed to.  \n\nWith the quality of the prepared dishes, I do feel it's overpriced.  \n\nThe bar has always been good with attentive bartenders.  The bar would be a 4.\n\n------------------------------\nYup, still working out the kinks.\n\nArriving a 8pm on a saturday guarantees SRBC to be jam packed.  We waited about 20 minutes before we were able to get a bartender's attention and order our drinks.  No complaints about that, the bar was lined 2 deep.  If you go around 5:30 and earlier or after 9:30pm, it is far less crowded.  There were also no kids there at 8pm onwards this saturday night.\n\nWe had a large group at the bar ordering drinks and food.  The fries took about 60 minutes to arrive because we were told the kitchen accidentally cancelled the order, but things like salads and items that did not need to be cooked arrived quickly.  I left by 10pm before our group of 6-8 was supposed to be seated since, lightweight.  But at 8pm, they ran out of one of the beers, and by 9:30, they only had 3 beers left (if people were interested in the flights with include 5 beers.)  For groups going there, be sure to have a reservation as larger groups will guarantee you to wait until late for a larger table to open up.  It gets noisy there, but not a bomb rating loud.  \n\nThe bartender got my subsequent order of the reservoir salad and the golden gate standard mule and ended up over charging me. Unless the prices on the menu is incorrect.  I prob should have mentioned it to her, but i was buzzed on my first drink and tipped on top of that.  I also wanted the chocolate stout cake, but they ran out of that (too).\n\nTHERE ARE BATHROOMS ON BOTH FLOORS OF THE SRBC.  There's a handicapped bathroom on the ground floor where both sexes can use. I am told the upper floor has mens and women's restrooms, separate.  The brewery does need to put extra TP around or have staff periodically check the bathrooms because by 9:45pm, there was no TP in the ground floor bathroom and everyone was using the hand paper towels. And you know, there will be at least a few people throwing the nonflushable paper towels down the toilet in their drunken state.  Don't want to clog it and have it flood. (That would clear the place.)\n\nThey now open at 10am on sundays and noon the rest of the week, when previously the open time was after 5pm.

To their credit, they were right on the money with the time estimate. We had a few of their beers at the bar while we waited. I'm no beer connoisseur, but I'd rate the beers we tried as follows: stout: B+, extra pale ale: B-, sour wheat: B.  \n\nThe ambiance of SRBC was maybe the best part. The layout is beautiful and interesting. The crowd was diverse: young and old, singles and families, etc. All of this amounted to a very welcoming experience.\n\nWe finally sat and ordered shishito peppers to start. They were fine; they're kind of a hard thing to mess up. For mains, we ordered the burger with fries and the pork shank with Sriracha sp\u00e4tzle. The burger was ordinary, paling in comparison to the best SF burgers. The fries that came with the burger were undercooked (i.e., tasted like raw potato). The pork shank was pretty good -- not overly flavorful but cooked well and tasty enough. I really liked the inventive take on their sp\u00e4tzle, which I may try and recreate in the home kitchen.\n\nIf I lived within walking distance of SRBC, I would stop by for a brew on the semi-regular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-17", "description": "This place is a solid addition to the Outer Sunset, so I'm trying not to tank their star rating with a few of my qualms. My goal is to provide honest feedback here, not berate the owners of this cool new establishment because the Sunset certainly needs more places to grab a craft beer. \n\nI got the chicken torta and it was so weird; it was sort of like dry chorizo with crumbled cheese on top. I saw a photo someone else posted and it didn't look a thing like the sandwich I got. For $10+ I wish I wouldn't have gotten what tasted like cafeteria food. Speaking of, there should be better descriptions of the food on the menu. We didn't know the burger came with fries, (there wasn't a note on the menu about it coming with a side) so we ordered a side of fries, leaving us with SO MANY FRIES. Also, my torta came with dry tortilla chips and no salsa. (Why? Why would you do that to me?! At least we had fries.) The burger was pretty good in terms of taste, but it came with two small patties instead of one big one. This led me to believe they had been sitting on the grill for a while and had shrank in size. Weird.  \n\nThe beer was good (though they were out of the Cherry Wheat that I wanted to try). We sat in the bar area, however, which led to us having to fend for ourselves when we needed something like a water refill. People kept walking past us at the little two-person tables and no one would make eye contact with us or ask how our food was. There should be a dedicated server for that area or at least someone floating around making sure everyone's okay. \n\nI might come back, but I'll probably get the soup, which looked pretty good compared to my sad, maybe-chicken sandwich. Also, guys, you're a restaurant with all-Spanish dish names and you have Tabasco instead of Tapatio or Cholula?! \n\nIt's pretty obvious from my experience and other reviews I've read that the kitchen hasn't been able to keep up with the pace/demand, but it would be pretty easy to throw some chips and salsa on the table for diners to munch on while the chefs take the time to prepare food with a little more care.", "author": "Whitney D."}

This place brings some more of the hipstery action to the Outer Sunset (for better or worse), but there are some things that can be improved upon. Mainly, the availability of food and drink items. \n\nThe beers were okay, nothing special, but it seems they're expanding their offerings in the future, so okay. But for the time being, especially since they only have 5-6 beers total, it would probably be easier for everyone if they had the beer menu on a chalk board so people could quickly see what's available (and more importantly what is not). When we finally got seated, we ordered the charred shishito peppers and the p.e.i. mussels. The clams were great, and it was big enough that one could probably eat it as an entree, but it's perfect to share among 3-4 people as a starter. Additionally, I'm glad that they give you bread and butter, so be sure to save that (or request more) to sop up all that remaining sauce.\n\nWe tried to order two burgers and one pasta. Maybe 10 minutes later, we were told they're out of burgers. Okay, let's change the burgers to the braised pork and trout. 15 minutes later, they told us they don't have the trout anymore either. Fine, let's go with the roasted half bird then. 15 minutes later, they came back to ask what the third person ordered (answer: pasta). Finally, all our food comes, and I have a pork shank that can feed a family, and my friend has a sad little piece of chicken breast on his plate (alright, I guess this is what a half bird is?). The pork shank was tender and the sriracha spaetzle and toybox carrots were really good, but the pasta was okay (improved by adding some pork shank) and the chicken was perfectly bland and healthily portioned. \n\nI don't know why we ordered dessert, but we did. And guess what, they ran out of something! Fortunately, it was not what we wanted. We got the bread pudding\nmade with bourbon, brioche, dried cherries, vanilla orange sauce, and ice cream they were proud to announce was from Polly Ann ice cream located nearby. We joked that right after telling us about the ice cream, we'd actually find out later that they ran out (they didn't run out! pleasant surprise!). The bread pudding was good, but I think I could've just eaten a bowl of the ice cream with sauce.\n\nIt's a fun addition to the neighborhood, but I'll stick to Social Kitchen & Brewery for now, since that's closer to me anyway.\n\nOh!

Let me sum this place up for you: awesome! Come now, and come often. I really liked this place, and I've been to many, many breweries in my day (even spent last weekend in San Diego touring breweries). This is a place the Sunset needed desperately, and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe walked in, put our name in, and had a drink at the bar while we waited. The place was pretty packed for 8PM on a Tuesday, but the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior of the place is really nice... modern but with some subtle cues to a german beer hall. \n\nThe Beer: really good. The Blonde & wheat especially surprised me, I'm not usually a big fan of those styles, but I liked theirs a ton. The double IPA will definitely become their most popular beer I would suspect. It's very citrus-y, with a nice hop bite. Very crushable. Can't wait for more beers from this place because this is a great start. Highly recommend the flight if it's your first time so you can try all of them. They come in a baking pan, which I thought was really cool since the owner is a baker (devil's teeth down the road).\n\nThe Food: also excellent. We had the flatbread and hummus for an appetizer, and it was very good. For the main course I had the Reservoir salad & my girlfriend had the chili. We shared both because they were both awesome. The salad was fresh and unique. The chili had a nice bite to it, but wasn't overwhelming. It was veggie too, which was great. For desert we had the bread pudding, and it was very good, too (as you would expect from a baker). \n\nThe Service: top notch. Not sure what others have said in here about the service being slow. Pretty much every person in the place came over to ask if we needed anything, to take empty plates, etc. It was fantastic. I really can't say enough good things about the service we received. Everyone was nice and chatted with us. 10/10 here. \n\nThe Price: on par with others like it. I think the other people saying it's expensive don't actually understand the market at all. This place is actually right on the money with the pricing I think. It's not too expensive at all. Especially if you compare to the other brewpubs in the city.

I am a local and consider myself a regular as I come here on average once every week. The bartender this day was the skinnier guy with not much hair(my receipt says PM B.) Pretty sure his name was Dave. The service from him on this day was absolutely foul. I'll try to highlight some key events.\n\n-sitting down the bartender handed us the menu and stood there looking at us waiting for us to place an order. What server does not give their customers any time to look over the menu? He did the same thing for two other customers that sat near me and they had to tell him they wanted more time with the menu. He did not say a word and just walked away.\n\n-When asked about which is the most popular beer, the reply was \"They are all equally popular\" and proceed to walk away. \n\n-The first check we received was wrong. He missed a lot of things on there and having a good conscience I decided to let him know that I was undercharged. He was not grateful at all. He was almost appalled that I corrected him on his mistake. Note that the difference in the two bills was almost $200. I would expect a little more gratitude.\n\n-When handing me the corrected bill he kept my credit card and asked if he can run it for the bill. I wanted to look over it again but again he stood there waiting for my reply while I go over a bill with well over 20 items on it. Feeling as he would not come back if I went back to my table to verify with my friends with that they ordered I just told him to run the card. \n\n-Checking the bill at home I was charged for an extra drink that no one ordered which was conveniently labeled as \"open drink\" on the receipt. \n\n-He pushed his way between two of my friends who were having a conversation and dropped his dish rack on the table and said he wanted to collect a few plates. No excuse me or anything before hand. That was really the last straw for us.\n\nTL:DR - Server PM B (the skinny one with the hair that really isn't there, name I believe was Dave) has some of the worst customer service I have ever received with friends saying the same exact same thing.

I was expecting it to become my go-to spot (especially because the beer is only $6 a pint!), but I don't go as often as I had expected - the food is really good, but the beer and service are a little disappointing.\n\nThe decor is nice, I love the high ceilings and the outdoor lights that are strung around.  The variation of small and large table is good for all groups, and the bar is a fine place to sit if you are looking for a casual drink/meal.  The food is also good - the fish and chips come with malt vinegar (!!!) and tartar sauce, and the bowl of Wings is sizable (at least when I got it!).  The burgers are good too, along with the appetizers. No complaints about the food.\n\nThe beers could be better... I think we are pretty spoiled on the west coast with the number of great breweries we have, so this may just be because I know what I like and what breweries I like better - so it just doesn't meet my mark.  But, I have taken friends and they say that they like the beer just fine!  \n\nMy final comment is about the service.  Every time we sit down, the waiters are always great.  However it's the initial welcome (that others have noted in their reviews as well) that is a bit unpleasant. They require that your whole party be there before you are seated.  Sometimes this is not possible.  What if someone is late? We should be able to sit down and start perusing the menu and maybe order some drinks or food while we wait.  They seem to be super snotty about this and it has always put me off whenever I go.  It just seems unprofessional to me.  I get it if I am the only person there waiting for a party of 7, but when 5 of us are there for a party of 7 and you still won't seat us?  That seems a little extreme.\n\nAlso, if you want to take a bunch of friends and sit at a table just for drinks - forget it.

The broth seems to have some ginger/lemongrass flavors in it that just make it unbelievable. We were drinking it out of the bowl last night. Last night we also got fried mac and cheese balls which were cheesy, creamy and paired well with their delicious marinara sauce. Portion was big also, for price. We also got the Sunset Caesar, which also was delicious, well balanced, and great portion size. The dessert, Salted Caramel cake, was great! It was our 3rd time having it in a row - couldn't bring ourselves to order a different dessert because of how much we loved this one! Old fashions, my go to drink, are always pretty good, if a bit inconsistent on the amount of alcohol from drink to drink. Last night, we got 2 old fashions at the same time, and it seems as if they weren't mixed well, because one definitely had way more alcohol then the other, and lacked balance.\n\nThe disappointment though has come with lacking attention or kindness from the wait staff. One day we obviously over ordered, and the bartender didn't let us know this until after all the food came out (mentioning at that point that he definitely thought we had over-ordered when he first put it in.) Last night we showed up at approximately 8:15, and they close at 9. We ordered pretty quickly and got through our meal pretty fast too. We ordered dessert as they asked for last call in the kitchen, and ordered our last drink as they asked for last call in drinks. We had already ordered a pretty good amount of food and alcohol, and asked if we could get another drink as we waited for dessert, and were told no. That's fine, but it was all done with no sympathy (as was her mood the entire time we were there.) Our dessert came out, and we had already given her a credit card to charge for our check, when they started TURNING THE LIGHTS OFF! We were literally a few bites away from being done, and still needed to leave a tip and sign before we could leave. This came across as a sign of us having overstayed our welcome. And although after tax and tip our meal came out to 100+, it seems like my business isn't appreciated enough to wait 5 minutes for us to finish our dessert, especially if we are repeating customers.", "author": "Mike V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-04", "description": "An interesting add to avenues life from the people who brought us Devil's Teeth bakery. I see a few similarities between them. More on that in a bit. \n\nArchitecturally, the place is impressive. Designed with a raw, warehouse kind of feel with exposed girders and wiring, it kind of says SOMA to me. Or if you know Southern Pacific Brewing, it has a similar vibe which is weird for the avenues. I like the airiness, it just feels like it is out of place. \n\nThe service is eager but a little scattered. Young, attractive, but perhaps not highly experienced. Clientele is youngish, hipsterish, chill. Lots of hoodies, backwards ball caps, and neck beards on the men. \n\nThe menu is on point, lots to choose from with interesting offerings. My main unhappiness with it is a kind of rigidness that probably protects the quality of the service but is kind of a pain.  Like Devil's Teeth the hours are not wide open. When I left at 3pm there was a sign saying the dining area was closed until 500 p.  The first time I tried to go it was 945p and they close at 1000p. But it isn't just the hours, I wanted to order the chilaquiles with a fried egg instead of scrambled. The kitchen wouldn't  do it because it would \"Change the dish\". Never mind that in the Mission at Boos Voni I get the eggs to order on my chilaquiles, what do they  know about it?\n\nThe fries were a little soggy like the oil was a little on the cool side.

Worth checking out to form your own opinion as overall it is a decent place and a welcome break from the vast majority of the restaurants in the Sunset. \n\nInterior/Staff:\n\nHiding in plain site on the outside - its interior has the ubiquitous lofty brewery space that will not be mistaken for a Chinese run sushi restaurant. At 7pm on a Thursday the patrons were all mixed 20 and 30 somethings. Those with children occupied the downstairs section while the unencumbered were safely sequestered upstairs on the mezzanine. Our server was very cheerful, got everything right the first time, though a bit slow. Despite a few concerns/misses described below we will likely return.  \n\nFood:\n\n*Hummus & Sambal - Everyone at the table liked it. Even the flat bread on it's own was tasty instead of merely being a cardboardy delivery vehicle.\n*Ahi Poke - This was decent, but could have been better. Too much orange rind throwing the overall taste a bit too far towards citrus and my standard gripe for poke outside of Hawaii is that the fish could be a little fresher.\n*Fettucini Bolognese - As tasty as it was heavy. Recommend sharing and offsetting with a salad. Hands down the winner of the 'what gave me heartburn' question.\n*Sea Bass with Cauliflower Puree - Turned out to be grouper that was a tad overcooked and overpriced, but otherwise good. I don't feel this is the place or the neighborhood for $28 entrees.\n*Burger - Average burger... as good as say Barneys on 24th/Castro but smaller and $6 more, but not as good as either The Corner Store or Super Duper. Something about the audacity of charging $16 for an average tasting (and sized) burger just irks me. Will not order it again or recommend for those reasons.\n*IPA - The only beer I sampled. It was a decent IPA though a bit warm. It was not a particularly warm day, so not sure if this is the norm.", "author": "Easwud C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-05", "description": "I love beer and I love supporting my local breweries even more. With that said Sunset reservoir is a solid 3 stars. I have been there 3 times so this review is a combination of the 3 times that I have been there. I am going to start of with the cons and then move on the the pros.\n\nCons:\n1. The first 2 times I have been there, it was some of the worst service I have experienced in SF, but this last time was much better.  \n2. The food is over priced. I like my food to be full of flavors and take my mouth on a journey, but everything I have had has need twice the ingredients including some of there beers (the session IPA is one of those beers) Seriously I wish the Session IPA tasted as good as it smells. The habanero mango chicken wings special was boring and had no flavor along with the \"habanero\" ranch that did not have any kick let alone taste like ranch. Also the menu does not always describe what they are serving. The second I went I got some Mexican soup with pork that said it with corn on their black and white printer paper menu, but it actually came with garbanzo beans. I still liked it a lot and really respected that some of the chunks of pork still had the skin attached. #nomnoms\n3. Not all the bartenders know how to pour stouts from a stout faucet. Twice I have gotten their Irish Stout and twice I watched in horror as the bartensee improperly poured the beer. I expect more from a brewery when it comes to how beer is poured and I won't be getting another stout until they address this problem.\n4. The real reason that is making me write this review is the growler fill. Before I say why I am so upset, I must say I respect the SS Growler they sell for $60. It is the nicest growler in my collection, but their label and brand imagine isn't as well thought out as the place's atmosphere. Now back to the real reason I am writing this review: they advertise 2 liter growler fills, but don't even pour you 64 oz. The growlers they sell show you a 64oz and 2 liters fill lines ON THE GROWLER. My first fill that was free with the $60 dollar purchase of the growler was at 64 oz fill line from this beautiful bar tender. But my second fill from some hipster, black bearded fellow was below 64oz fill line. I was really starting to change my opinion about the place until this hipster barely gave me 64oz after clarifying the fill was 2 liters. I got my favorite beer there, the sour wheat, and for a beer enthusiast, who likes supporting local brews, this was more offensive than when Social Brewery stopping their growler fills. Social at least announced they stopped doing growler fills. I am bitter about the few oz I lost after dropping $60 on my growl daddy. For the love of beer please start labeling your growlers with the name of the beer and the info like every other brewery. \n\nNow for the Pros:\n1. Baes. Not only is the staff attractive, but the crowd that comes in is just as good looking. From the 21 year olds to the cougars and that goes for the men as well, but I don't fancy them. Everytime I go in the place is packed with the Outer Sunset's finest.\n2. SOME of the beers are tasty. My personal favorites are the Sour Wheat (made with Devils Teeth sourdough and if you don't know about Devil's Teeth you need to go. Hands down the best place in the Outer Sunset) and the Mai Beck.\n3. The atmosphere. The place is gorgeous large open space with big dark wood beams and some steal beams. They have 2 bars one up stairs and the big one down stairs that has 2 televisions always playing sports. Upstairs would be epic for a private party, but works well for families with young kids in the mean time. There are men and women's bathrooms on both floors. I really love that you can see part of the brewery through glass windows that span the 2 floors.  The music is great and not too loud which is nice since I have bad hearing on my right side. It is a great spot to get dinner with your friends, family, or go on a date; I have done all 3.\n4. Great selection of liquor and cocktails. They got whatever you are craving and every house cocktail I have tried has been delicious. I am impressed with there selection. \n\nOverall it is a good place to go get a sit down meal whether you are on a date, with friends, or family. They are a new place intown and are still working out the kinks. With everything I've said, I will still be coming back for dinner and to fill my growler, but only as long as they keep on improving.", "author": "Taylor F."}

My family and I come here often, ever since they opened. But my parents had never gone, so I took my parents to SRBC the other day bc I kept talking about the fried chicken, and fish and chips to them. Unfortunately, they have a new chef, and s/he changed up the recipe on the batters. When our food came, I immediately knew something was different. The burger my dad ordered was smaller than before (patty wasn't as thick or big), and the bun didn't seem like the brioche-like bun they used to serve, it looked like a standard burger bun. It used to have a visual presence, and this was simply ordinary. Instead of large pieces of fish (like thick strips of cod), the fish came as smaller pieces, think chicken nugget sizes. The fried chicken batter wasn't crispy, but more on a doughier-chewy side. I must admit it was a disappointment. What good is fried chicken if it's not crispy, and what fun is it to eat fish and chips if it doesn't fall apart as you bite into it? Even the flavor of the batters were different. I asked our server if there was a new person in the kitchen and the server confirmed it. The server was impressed I could tell from the taste and I mentioned it wasn't just the taste but the texture as well, not to mention the portions were significantly smaller. The server put a good spin on the new batter formulas, and I agreed just to make it not so awkward. But honestly, I wish the new chef kept the original recipse.

The bar was extremely crowded, but we ordered our drinks and were hanging by the bar when 2 servers collided behind us--spilling beer all over our shoes! I had boots on, so it came right off, but my boyfriend had white suede sneakers that definitely were stained. They also didn't offer us any paper towels to clean ourselves off! I had to grab a handful of napkins from the bar while they proceeded to wipe the floors with their towels, completely ignoring us while I was flipping out. Are we invisible? Another customer saw the whole thing and asked if he could buy us a drink which we politely declined. I mean, it wasn't HIS fault. It would've just been nice had the staff apologized and gave us some towels to wipe out shoes since it WAS just an accident. \n\nNight #2: We decided to give this place a second chance. We waited about an hour for a table (even though estimated wait time was 2 hours) to have some dinner. In the meantime we thought we'd grab a drink at the bar. Wrong. It was so crowded that it was impossible to order, let alone walk to the other end of the bar. We tried multiple areas of the bar and couldn't get any of the bartender's attention. We got yelled at multiple times by servers asking us to \"move out of the way\" to which I responded \"there's nowhere else for us to go!\" It was frustrating for them and it was very frustrating for us. We finally got our drinks near the end of the bar where the servers pick up their orders and skedaddled off to a small little corner. When we were finally seated upstairs, the food was mediocre, not memorable, and a little overpriced. We did have an extremely nice and amazing waitress though. She was blonde with shoulder length hair, and she definitely kept the night from being a total disaster. \n\nAlso a tip for this restaurant: add more tables upstairs because there was a lot of empty space that could've been used more wisely. And the bar upstairs is much less busy. Wish we had known.", "author": "Lily Z."}

I have lived in the sunset for a very long time and I guess its changing now, and for the better. \n\nWe came here with a group of about 10 friends because a mutual friend was visiting from out of town. The place is HUGE. It is very spacious, has two floors, and very good vibe. \n\nDon't judge me, but I didn't order any beer. I wasn't really feeling it. Instead I ordered some whiskey with ice. Nothing special, the only thing that could have been better is if they had one large cube of ice instead of many. But I came to a brewery and I guess I deserve this. \n\nFood. Food is really good. We actually ordered 2 orders of their hot wings. They come in a bowl and you don't get just 6. You probably get about 20 small wings that all taste really good. We also ordered fries, which were nice and crispy. And we ordered some eggplant dish that looked really tasty but I didn't try any. \n\nAbout the beer. One of my friends ordered their flight. They make 6 beers from light to dark. 4/6 beers were apparently really good.

First time just for a beer, which was fine. 2nd time was last night for apps and drinks. We were seated in the dining section, ordered a beer, a cider, Kennebec fries and Buffalo Wings. Our waitress was very nice and said, \"sorry, we have no more bread but I've got some water for you and so sorry, I'm serving the water in plastic kid cups.\" Not 2 minutes later, she brings a bowl of bread out for the table of 4 guys sitting exactly next to us, and brought them out water in regular water glasses. \n\nHmm? Weird? Gets weirder. She brings out our drinks - a beer for the hubby in a typical 12oz glass and my cider in a glass that's meant for a drink 7-8oz at most (we have the same exact glass at home). On the menu, the cider is listed as a 10oz serving of cider. I ask the waitress whether this is the right pour and she says,\"Oh! I'm sure that's 10oz of cider!\" And that's that! I decided not to push it. \n\nMoral of the story - when you're here (if you so choose to patronize Sunset Brewing) make sure you are getting what you pay for! \n\nI would love to return but it looks like they have a lot of sloppy kinks to work out.", "author": "Jo A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-23", "description": "Full disclosure: I'm a Sunset boy. Like, if you click on my profile picture, you will see I'm wearing a Sunset shirt. Born and raised, and I still hang out there regularly. My boys and I ordered Purple Dragons from Polly Ann's Ice Cream when it was a hole in the wall in the middle of the block, not its current location on the corner. So I'm confident in saying I got a good vibe of what will work and what won't work in the neighborhood. \n\nWith that said--and it pains me to say this--I don't see the Sunset Reservoir Brewing Company doing terribly well in the long-term unless they make some changes. Particularly regarding the food prices. \n\nLet me preface this by saying the experience itself was good--no complaints about the quality of food, the service, or the ambiance. Sunset Reservoir Brewing Company (which I will call SRBC for short) just opened a couple of days ago, and they were packed on a Monday night. Cool vibe. \n\nAnd given they are a BREWERY, their beer was great. I had the Flight, which gave me a sample of their five beers. I'm an IPA guy, and their Double IPA hit the spot. (My benchmark for IPA is Deschutes' freshly squeezed IPA from Oregon, for those of you wondering about my beer palate). Their wheat beer was pretty unique too, in a good way--it had a sweet aftertaste. So, no complaints about their beer, which is what a BREWERY should be judged on.\n\nBUT! (There's always a but). My complaint is with the food. Or, more specifically, the price of the food. We got flat bread ($11) and mussels ($12), which were OK but nothing special. For our entrees, my friend got the pork loin and I got the chicken dinner--both recommended by our very friendly server (who was great). It's not that the food was terrible--the meat was cooked well (the white meat wasn't dry, which is how I judge how well the chicken was done). It's just that it wasn't anything special. Now, what's the big deal about being special? Well, if you're charging $26 for the pork loin and $20 for the chicken, there better be something special about it--especially in the Sunset. I get it, the neighborhood is starting to attract a different kind of crowd and what not, but I know that location very well: On one corner is a Japanese restaurant that serves heaving portions of food for a relatively cheap price. On the other corner is a Chinese takeout restaurant where you can get a rice plate for $5. Those places are still in business because they know what the local market wants. I understand the SRBC isn't necessarily trying to get that clientele, but the point is, the SRBC's prices are going to be a big turnoff for the locals, if I know anything about the locals (and I do). \n\nIf I had to come up with a comp, it feels like the SRBC wants to be kinda like a fancier \"Q\", which used to be in the Richmond District before they closed. But \"Q\" had a pretty distinct identity--and to be fair, the SRBC JUST opened, so this can change. But considering this is a BREWERY, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't any typical bar fare. No chicken wings. No calamari. No sliders. I suppose SRBC is trying to raise the stakes with higher quality food, but if that food tastes just OK--and is expensive--that isn't a recipe for success in the Sunset. \n\nNow if this review makes it seem like I'm cheap, let it be known I would pay $2 for a regular chocolate chip cookie from the Devil's Teeth Baking Company, which, from my understanding, has a stake in the SRBC. And I know plenty of people who would balk at paying $2 for a cookie. I'd still argue $26 is high for pork loin from a brewery, but if it was really good, I'd pay it, no questions asked. \n\nI'd be happy to go back and enjoy a Double IPA, but unless their food game improves--either in deliciousness or price--then I don't envision going back as often as I might. The SRBC has time to make changes and tweaks to improve, and I'm hopeful they will: It would be great to see a place like this thrive in the neighborhood. But unless they make those adjustments, I question its staying power.", "author": "Chris W."}

I have waited desperately for a place like this for almost 20 years......\n\nWent tonight for the first time, arrived about 5:45pm. Great decor, reclaimed wood wall behind the bar, exposed industrial look, modern, fresh. Complete opposite of the tired look most of the remainder of Noriega St. businesses present. Good thing we arrived early, because within an hour it was bursting at the seams. Fantastic vibe and energy. We sampled beers and snacks first (olives and chili almonds). Lighter beers (wheat, blonde and  double IPA) were our favorites. Consistent with the styles of beer we like other places as well. The snacks were fine, but not yet as good as they can be. My wife had a Martian Ranch Syrah after finishing the beer tasting, and we both thought it was excellent. I had a full pint of the Blonde, probably my favorite of the beers.\n\nOur server took great care of us, despite the place being a madhouse. I am sure it will quiet down as SRBC gets settled in. My wife and I split a Reservoir salad and burger. Loved the burger. Although we didn't quite figure it out at the time due to animated conversation, our salad (butter lettuce, mango, avocado, palm hearts, pistachio), was missing the hearts of palm and dressing! We did mention in passing to our server that the salad seemed \"off\", and it was removed from the check without question. We will have it again next time and pay more attention!\n\nWe finished off with bread pudding. Generally not my favorite, but I was really pleased with this one. Not too sweet, not soggy, it was just right. Given that one of the owners is from the Devil's Teeth Bakery, I suppose that isn't too surprising!\n\nPrice? As expected in San Francisco. Quality and nice decor costs more. Always, and everywhere. You simply don't get a steak for the price of a hot dog, no matter how much you may want it.", "author": "Ernest C."}

Went here opening night with my husband for date night.  It is located on Noriega near 25th Avenue, next door to Noriega Teriyaki House.  This new hot spot boasts lots of space, wooden bar area and an upstairs area with more seating.  Oh.. and they serve beer!!  We each had the beer sampler.  My favorites were Blonde and Rye Amber.  We also ordered the meat and cheese plate.  I loved the loukanika sausage and the country  pate.  This place is such a WELCOME CHANGE  TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD especially to the Outer Sunset!!  I work in the FiDi and the prices for this place are about right.  And yes, one is not too far from places serving heaping portions of greasy, salty food at cheap prices.  But how much of the same thing can you have??  I see success for Sunset Reservoir Brewing Co.  Why? Because it's different, the ambiance is nice, the food is so far good... and they serve beer! I love the vibe and can't wait to go back.  TIP:  I recommend people take Uber or Lyft to this place.

I have been here twice and was very impressed with the variety/quality of the food and the drink availability.  Full bar with many options for liquor and beer on tap.  Some of the beer is malt-based (eg English IPA), so you should be into that, but I was impressed and great to have a spot out in the Sunset with beer straight from the source!\n\nFirst time I was there, I ordered the burger - contains guacamole and is well-done unless if you request otherwise.  Very juicy and tasty burger with a boatload of fries.  A bit small for $16, but I suppose that is becoming more common in such an expensive city.  Would certainly recommend if you don't mind the price.\n\nSecond time I was there with a friend from work and ordered the pasta bolognese.  It was around the same price as the burger, but portion-wise gave a lot more.

I won't pay that much for a burger, (even if it's organic and ethically farmed...because I can make that, or get it for a bit less elsewhere...and let's face it...a $16 burger?!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-21", "description": "We live in the Inner Sunset and are always looking for new casual places to eat, especially breweries. And very much want them to succeed. So, I'm hoping this place either just had a bad night, or gets better soon.\n\nUpon walking in, my 7 yr old daughter started walking up the steps into the dining area and I quickly asked her to come back. As she was walking back, she slightly got in the way of one of the staff. I politely said \"Excuse us\" and he didn't look up or even acknowledge us.\n\nThe hostess arrived in short order, was polite and we were quickly seated. \n\nAs an app, we ordered Wings and received a bowl of the \"wing\" part of the wings, not the mini-drumsticks. I'm not a wing expert, but every other time I've had wings, you get both parts in equal number. The wings were fair in taste, but very small and very little meat. However, the blue cheese dressing was not in short supply and with large chunks of cheese. Had we only had thick wings to pour it over.\n\nMy wife enjoyed her Sea Bass, but just coming off a dozen years as a vegetarian, she didn't have much to compare it to. I tasted it, and it was dry and a bit more fishy than Sea Bass I've had at finer establishments. At $24 I would have expected better. \n\nMy roasted chicken was a fairly ample helping, but the skin looked plastic and tasted the same. The meat was fairly moist, but tasteless. The cauliflower was a bit too hard, the beans were listed on the menu as \"string beans\", but were a mixture of green and waxed beans, and were tough. Overall, not at all worth the $20.\n\nOff the kids menu, my daughter got pasta with red sauce, in a smallish bowl for $9. If we'd paid $4, it would have been fair. And it was unusually (temperature) hot. My son's fried fish plate looked great. The salad was large, the fries were the best thing we had. But the fish was \"Mushy\" according to him, and looked to be pretty greasy. When he asked for vinegar for his fish, the waitress responded with \"we don't have any\", yet the salad was drenched in vinegar. I'd say if you're going to offer a battered fish, offer vinegar. Something even my 12 yr old is aware of.\n\nIn terms of the beer, I'm an IPA fan, to a fault. But, have not had an \"English IPA\" and gave it a try. Not at all hoppy, citrusy, or creamy the way I'd hoped. It was fairly flat, warm and I can't say I ever leave a beer on the table, but this one got left. I asked to try the Extra Pale Ale and was brought a small glass. IMHO, a bit flavorless. But the big issue, was I had over half a glass of beer in front of me, asked to try something else, and my server (who was otherwise pleasant) didn't once ask if I wasn't satisfied with my beer. Any other brewery I've been to, would have asked if I like it and offered something as a replacement.\n\nI sincerely hope this place gets it together. It would be great to have another go-to brewery in the neighborhood as an alternate for Social Kitchen and Magnolia. The place has a great aesthetic, beautiful vaulted wood ceiling, great looking bar, and ample seating. \n\nMy beer issue might have just been my aversion to the English version of the IPA. But, the food was on the low end in the taste department and at a premium price. Two kids meals, two adult meals, one beer and two sodas sets us back over $90 before tip. I'm going to keep checking the reviews... I'd love to give this place another shot, but not until I'm sure they've made an improvement.", "author": "Dustin S."}

The place is very modern and high tech with a lot of natural wood materials.  Unfortunately, San Francisco was in the midst of a heat wave and the upstairs seating was unbelievably hot.  Luckily, my group was seated downstairs near the open door.\n\nStarted the experience with a nicely priced $10 drink at the bar before getting seated for the meal.  The Reservoir then started to show they still have growing pains.  The waitress must have been new and took our drink orders at different times so, three flights came to three different people at three different times.  Also, for our table of seven, four meals came first then the remaining three came much later.  The food came so late that the half the table finished before the other half got their food.  \n\nI think they recognized the huge error because we got better service, plates being removed timely, and more attention as we waited for the last three entrees and as we finished our food.  The manager (I think she was) came and personally served those last three plates.  \n\nThe Reservoir got back a star because they didn't charge us for all desserts.  And those desserts were very delicious.  Nothing wrong there.\n\nOverall, the beer as just ok, the food was about even, with half of the plates better than average and half was ok too.  I think I would go back but just give them a little time to perfect the service, beer and the kitchen.  Why not, it is a brewery in the Sunset district.\n.", "author": "Victor S."}

I live walking distance away from this place so I've gone enough times to see the menu go thru seasonal changes. I've never had a bad experience. The only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars for me is they took away my favorite from the menu. Grrr. It was the mussels in a broth with chrorizo, cilantro. It was so good I would order it as an app while waiting for main dish. The burger is good, the fried chicken dish is good too. Fries, yum. Beer, yum. :)", "author": "Juan C."}

I probably would come here again if a friend wanted to grab a beer in the sunset because I really liked the open layout but would I come here for their awesome selection of beer? =P Nope! I get that as a brewing company you want to serve your own personal brews but I think you should have more than one guest beer. I personally love to choose from a wide selection but when I only get to choose from 5 different choices it makes me a bit sad. It's like being a guy and getting all dressed up to go to a club and the ratio is like 10:1. Disappointing I say! Hopefully they'll expand their number of guest beers if enough people complain about it. =P I ended up getting the extra pale ale which I did like but then again I think I've only disliked 2 beers in my entire lifetime. n_n;;; \n\nWaiters were super friendly though which is why I bumped up my review to 3 stars! They were super chill and okay with me being the annoying chick who keeps switching tables cause she doesn't know how big her party is. n_n;; I didn't get a chance to try the food so maybe next time. =D", "author": "Jennifer O."}

Food was fine, but beer was nothing special. Social Kitchen & Brewery has way more interesting beer. The service came with a high attitude toll -- as in douchey, too cool for school bullshit that makes SF natives like me cringe. Who do these people think they are? They chased us out by slamming chairs on top of a tables all around us. No one came over to give us a heads up that it was close to closing time. They just blasted Beyonc\u00e9 to drive us out the door. This place is not worth the attitude. There are other quality spots in the neighborhood that know how to treat their customers right.

First time, we came for lunch and were underwhelmed but decided to give them another shot for brunch. I had their breakfast sliders with egg, bacon, avocado, onion and jalapeno jelly. The biscuit got really soggy really fast and I could barely pick it up. The jalapeno jelly was strange - didn't add anything to the dish. Potatoes were not good at all. My husband got the eggs benedict. Instead of an english muffin, they do a slightly larger version of the biscuit - it's totally rich and didn't pair well with the egg, canadian bacon and rich sauce. My husband commented that the egg was cooked well, bacon was really good and the sauce was also done well. If they'd served with a normal english muffin, I'm sure he would have liked it. With that heavy, buttery muffin, he couldn't even get through it and felt ill afterwards. The server was nice, although slow, and it was expensive. Oh, and the mimosa I had was flat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-08", "description": "3.5 stars would be my honest assessment. \nI immediately liked the faux-rustic, cavernous space that, on the afternoon we went, admitted a generous amount of natural light. One half of the ground floor is bar space, the other table seating. There's also a crow's nest section. I must say, the reception was enthusiastic, the host seating us (a young, slim Asian) stuck around several minutes to chat and find out what part of town we lived in. I wish she'd been our server, because she was very nice.\nI ordered a flight of five beer samplings to get a sense in one fell swoop I guess of what this brewery was all about. Of the five, the stout, the blonde and the Double IPA stood out. I've never understood the appeal of sour beers, however we were told that the sour element (yeast?) had been brought from a sister venture located elsewhere in the Sunset. My girlfriend ordered the Sayulita Sunset, a juicy tequila concoction, that was a tad sugary but overall decent.\nThe primary failing and disappointment of our visit was that the cured meat flatbread dish, although served fairly promptly, arrived cold. Otherwise, a generous portion was afforded, and would have been a true winner if hotter. While not specified as a stand alone side, we asked for and got an order of fries. These tasted fine. In way of food, all we really wanted the afternoon we came was something to wash down with beer, otherwise the small menu offers finer culinary prospects. If we return it will have been the beer that brought us, and my overall ranking of that is: decent. I'm not sure I could pinpoint any unique flavors, though one of the beers that was described as having flower and honey elements did smell rewardingly of those.", "author": "Brian G."}

Great neighborhood vibe with food and drinks that make it a destination place, too.  I've been 4 times - dinner for 2, dinner for 9, dinner for 4, and lunch for 2.  Service has always been friendly and welcoming.  There is a wait sometimes, but never has it been awful, and they're very up front about the wait times (though we didn't wait as long as they quoted).  \n\nThe food is fabulous.  The burger is one of the top burgers in the city, the fries, too.  The house-made flatbread with hummus and sambal is almost perfect.  The polenta with the roast chicken is spectacular - creamy polenta, just the right consistency and texture, with a nice chili kick on the chicken.  The chicken torta was delicious, with great flavor but hard to pick up to eat (dove in with a fork and knife).  Only small mis-step I've seen was the chile - great flavor but the beans needed more time to cook.  Overall, definitely a place to look forward to eating. \n\nOur two young kids also enjoyed their food - there is a kids' menu with good choices.\n\nThe drinks have all been wonderful, too.  The beer is fabulous, and the brewmaster has come by to check up on that.  Friendly guy who will chat you up about the beer and the process.  He even showed a couple folks the brewing facilities in the back.  All the beers I've tried were great, but my favorite is the amber - deep flavor, refreshing, and great finish.

You can imagine my disappointment when I went for my first time and not only was there a TWO hour wait at 5:30 on a Wednesday, but the hostess was incredibly rude to boot. AY. I understand that it recently opened, so I gave the benefit of the doubt and decided to give it a second chance. This time around, I was seated pretty quickly which was a plus. Our server was very nice and knew the menu well, which was a second plus. Now for the drinks and food: Beer was honestly OK. Tasted a little flat but did the trick. For dinner I decided to try their burger (a staple of any good restaurant), even though $16 seemed a little steep given the environment. I have to say that the meat itself was tasty and seemed of good quality. Unfortunately the fries tasted like they were frozen about 20 minutes prior to being on my plate. \n\nMy suggestions? This is a brewery, so ideally there should be a decent selection of small bites/bar food. I understand that this city has turned into a yuppie's paradise but common people! After the hype wares down, it will be the locals that keep this place open. It's as if one side of the brewery is geared towards having drinks and socializing-- and the other half feels like its trying to be a higher end eatery that belongs on Valencia. \n\nHopefully they are able to work out the kinks and give the locals a friendly, tasty go to eatery.", "author": "Ahna K."}

It took a while to come back to me because the bartender was a little confused as to what it was and ended up mixing the two together- not personally how I like it, but I drank it anyway and thought it was fairly priced at $6. My friends got the flights which I tried and liked most of them. The Irish stout does def taste just like guinness. No complaints here tho. My bf liked his blonde ale. The service was also friendly. I really would like to try the food as there isn't many quality traditional american food options in the neighborhood.. It's a shame that it's a little more on the pricey side. All in all, I think this place is great and after some more time will become even better! Will probably become a regular. :)", "author": "Nicole K."}

Last night we were looking forward to drinking some good beer with dinner while watching the Warriors win in the finals. I'm not an extreme sports fan but I think its fair to say most of San Francisco is thrilled and captivated by this team ( Go Dubs!).  When we walked in to sunset there were kids all over the bar - not one, not two but about ten 4-8 year olds taking up seats.  They had the sound off the two TVs at the bar.  We asked when they were turning the sound on for the game and were told that they were not as they 'didn't want to be a sports bar'. This came directly from the manager. Um...when you hang two large TV's in your bar you should probably own that and in any case, this was more of a special occasion. There were a lot of glum folks in blue and gold who left when we did.  I should mention that there were many empty tables still at prime dinner time so if Sunset Reservoir is aspiring to be the Applebees of the Sunset they are missing the mark there too.  Ended up at Underdog and had the best food and best time with a lot of San Francisco spirit and hospitality. Happy to be there when the Warriors won. Looking forward to Sunday's game but will not return to Sunset any time soon.  Hope they get it together - its a beautiful space but is leaving us cold.", "author": "C. G."}

The food is delicious, the atmosphere is warm, the ceiling is high (which I love), and it lookes clean and like I said before, warm. I was gazing around with a really good beer in my hand thinking that I would try to get a group of my friends to switch to this place on Friday nights. It's got enough of everything, and all of it fantastic quality, that everyone will be happy. There are plenty of neat beers to try. I like the sample platter, me and my two friends had a blast comparing beers the first time I was there. The second time we tried something the bartender recommended with basil and gin. Sounds hit or miss, but It was amazing! The place seems like it's really well done to me. I love the wood and the big bar, there was plenty of room to sit.  The bartender and waitstaff were professional, friendly,  knowledgable, and there was an excitement about the place: maybe because it's new and the neighborhood really supports it. It's a very local endeavor, not a chain or a VC project and they really seem to care about service and quality . I also really recommend the burger, sounds typical but it was really satisfying. I'll have already gone back by the time you read this, I think this is a great place.", "author": "molly d."}
