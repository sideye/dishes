However, you have to order up front at the counter first, so it's kinda like a fast-food restaurant styled place. The time went by faster because you can get your own water / tea near the counter and bring it to any table by yourself.\n\n3) The Food\nI actually did not have high expectations coming into this restaurant, but the food quality was actually better than I expected. Compared to every other restaurant, this place actually had the largest portion of Chicken Teriyaki I have encountered in a single order. However, keep in mind, this could be due to the fact that it's not really bento-styled and did not come with any rolls and tempura, but just Miso Soup, Salad, and 2 Slices of Oranges.\n\nThe Salad, in particular, I believe had a peanut sauce/dressing and was quite unique, but very good. There did not seem to be too much rice in comparison to the Teriyaki Chicken.\n\nKeep in Mind: \n*It may be due to the time, but this neighborhood is definitely not the best and I did not feel completely safe here.\n*The waitress/cashiers didn't seem to the friendliest but did come by a couple times to collect our dishes and such. While leaving, she was at the door and did not greet me until I thanked her and left.\n\n\n*Final Verdict*\nIf you're in the area and you're looking for some quick Japanese food, then this is where you should go. It wont amaze you, but it definitely will satisfy your craving for Japanese food.

She lacked a smile and definitely looked like she did not want to be there. I ordered a Chicken Katsu with Curry, but she misheard me and charged me for a Chicken Katsu. When I corrected her, she wasn't apologetic about the mistake, but just waited for me to pay the extra fee for curry. She also threw the table number card at me in a very unprofessional, uncaring way and she pretty much set the low standards of customer service at Tokyo Express.\n\nHowever, what changed my mind from rating this restaurant a 2-star to a 4-star was the kind gentleman serving our entrees. He was very kind and hard-working. Props to him for smiling throughout his shift and not looking like he hated working there like his boss!\n\nAs for the quality of the food, I really enjoyed my Chicken Katsu to be honest. It was much better than your average Chicken Katsu for two reasons - tender chicken meat and fried to a perfect degree. The katsu was not dry or dough-y like other katsu entrees I've tried. $3.00 for a bowl of curry is a bit steep of a price in my opinion and I kind of wish I didn't order the curry - there was nothing special about it. They have plenty of sauces on the sides of each table to use, ranging from Tonkatsu sauce to Sririacha to Soy Sauce and more. As for my friend's entree, I tried his Chicken Teriyaki dish and wasn't impressed at all. In fact, I was a bit disappointed. The chicken was much tougher and drier than the chicken in my dish and left an unsatisfying feeling in my stomach.\n\nIf you're looking for quickly served food, this is definitely your pitstop.

The interiors had the basic fast food booths, chairs, and tables. I wonder if this was the location of IHOP and/or Denny's back in the day.

She lacked a smile and definitely looked like she did not want to be there. I ordered a Chicken Katsu with Curry, but she misheard me and charged me for a Chicken Katsu. When I corrected her, she wasn't apologetic about the mistake, but just waited for me to pay the extra fee for curry.

It was much better than your average Chicken Katsu for two reasons - tender chicken meat and fried to a perfect degree. The katsu was not dry or dough-y like other katsu entrees I've tried. $3.00 for a bowl of curry is a bit steep of a price in my opinion and I kind of wish I didn't order the curry - there was nothing special about it. They have plenty of sauces on the sides of each table to use, ranging from Tonkatsu sauce to Sririacha to Soy Sauce and more.

Of course, most of the tables are small but about 3 to 5 are medium to large. \n\nIt's like everybody says, fast casual japanese.  You go all the way inside to the front of the counter past all the tables to the right & left of you, and you wait in line, place your order from the menu descriptions/pics near the counter.  CC is ok. There's usually a  weekday special for under $10 which includes a mini salad, mini soup, and the specified entree with steamed rice.  Or they also have a sushi daily lunch special for under $10 with mini salad & mini soup.  The cool water flavored with lemon or lime slices is free on the left hand side for you to get with one of the metal cups nearby.   There's also heated tea.

The NY roll had the cooked shrimp tempura which made it crunchy but creamy with the avocado, cool with the cucumber, and tasty with the tobiko.  The only problem was they served me my salad & soup AFTER they served me the sushi & tonkatsu.  Like I said, it's not a really formal sit down restaurant.  It's a large mixture of express, casual, fast, and only a slightly formal format with a waitperson delivering your food.\n\nI have to say, be careful of coming during weekday lunch times!!  They're spacious but they're also very popular.  Either come early for lunch or late for lunch so that you (and your friends) will have an easier time to get an empty table and avoid long lines.\n\nI thought the portion size of food was on the light side, but at least the variety and affordability are present.

Compared to every other restaurant, this place actually had the largest portion of Chicken Teriyaki I have encountered in a single order. However, keep in mind, this could be due to the fact that it's not really bento-styled and did not come with any rolls and tempura, but just Miso Soup, Salad, and 2 Slices of Oranges.\n\nThe Salad, in particular, I believe had a peanut sauce/dressing and was quite unique, but very good.

It looks small from the outside, but the inside is spacious with about 20 tables.  Of course, most of the tables are small but about 3 to 5 are medium to large. \n\nIt's like everybody says, fast casual japanese.  You go all the way inside to the front of the counter past all the tables to the right & left of you, and you wait in line, place your order from the menu descriptions/pics near the counter.  CC is ok. There's usually a  weekday special for under $10 which includes a mini salad, mini soup, and the specified entree with steamed rice.  Or they also have a sushi daily lunch special for under $10 with mini salad & mini soup.  The cool water flavored with lemon or lime slices is free on the left hand side for you to get with one of the metal cups nearby.   There's also heated tea.  Once they give you a card with a number, you go to an empty table, put the card in the metal card holder so that the waitperson can spot you and give you your food.    Everything is carefully organized on every table as far as condiments and napkins are concerned.  You may want to go up to the left hand counter in front for a fork if you don't want to use chop sticks.  \n\nI had a pork tonkatsu wednesday special which was ok cooked and I also ordered a separate NY sushi roll  for $6.50 which was also well prepared.  The NY roll had the cooked shrimp tempura which made it crunchy but creamy with the avocado, cool with the cucumber, and tasty with the tobiko.  The only problem was they served me my salad & soup AFTER they served me the sushi & tonkatsu.  Like I said, it's not a really formal sit down restaurant.  It's a large mixture of express, casual, fast, and only a slightly formal format with a waitperson delivering your food.\n\nI have to say, be careful of coming during weekday lunch times!!  They're spacious but they're also very popular.  Either come early for lunch or late for lunch so that you (and your friends) will have an easier time to get an empty table and avoid long lines.\n\nI thought the portion size of food was on the light side, but at least the variety and affordability are present.

However, you have to order up front at the counter first, so it's kinda like a fast-food restaurant styled place. The time went by faster because you can get your own water / tea near the counter and bring it to any table by yourself.\n\n3) The Food\nI actually did not have high expectations coming into this restaurant, but the food quality was actually better than I expected.

However, keep in mind, this could be due to the fact that it's not really bento-styled and did not come with any rolls and tempura, but just Miso Soup, Salad, and 2 Slices of Oranges.\n\nThe Salad, in particular, I believe had a peanut sauce/dressing and was quite unique, but very good.
