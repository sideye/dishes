As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile. Cashier recommended the sides. They also bring out your order to your table and in a timely manner. They ask how the food was, they ask if they can refill your drink or if they can get you anything else and they offer to remove the basket as soon as you are done eating so it's not in your way. I've never experienced such high customer service at a burger joint before.

That's because the menu behind the counter is for 2020 vision and not everyone has 2020 or wears glasses or contacts.

They will make the burger to your specifications, but only well done. \n\nThe burger that I had came with truffles, mushrooms and swiss and was highly seasoned which I like (that may be a bad to some people who hate salt). There is a choice of regular or large size, I had the large. \n\nThe SmashFries are seasoned in Rosemary and dipped in an oil, which I forgot which oil, but they are delicious.

The staff was nice and seemed very friendly. I was asked 3 times how everything was and did I need anything else which may have been a little overkill, but understandable for a new place. I'm sure this will not be the case after the top staff completes the training of the locals and move on.

For years I've driven past their location in Novato but never had the opportunity of trying their food until today. Smashburger is a fast-casual eatery, similar to Five Guys or Chipotle. As I walked in, you're instructed to grab a menu as you make your way to the front counter. Even with 5 of 6 customers in front of us, the line moved rapidly giving me just enough time to look over the menu. \n\nThe menu is broken into two main sections: burgers or \"smashburgers\" and chicken sandwiches, appropriately called \"smashchicken\". Whether you're in the mood for beef or poultry, you have plenty to choose from with roughly 7 or so sandwiches to choose from or you can create your own. Additionally fresh salads and a kids menu are also offered. A variety of french fries are offered from traditional to spicy, as well as onion rings, fried pickles, or a side salad. Of course a burger shack isn't complete until shakes and malts are involved.\n\nI settled on ordering the Spicy Jalapeno Baja grilled chicken sandwich. The toppings sounded too goo to pass up: guacamole, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, onion & chipotle mayo on a spicy chipotle bun. The sandwich was priced at a more than reasonable $7.29, which led me to add a side salad for only $2.99. After placing your order, you're given a number and can seat yourself anywhere.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, my order was delivered to my table. The tray of food not only looked great but healthy and fresh. I was a little perplexed because the chicken was paper thin, making me think it was an egg, but after looking at it closely, it was the all-white grilled chicken. I took a few bites of the sandwich without altering the taste with any sauce or condiments and it was downright tasty. The baja flavors really worked well and had plenty of heat with the jalapenos and chipotl mayo. I added a bit of yellow mustard and it was a surprisingly tasteful sandwich packing plenty of flavor.\n\nI ordered my side salad with their house vinaigrette which was better than most placed. Sure, the fries my co-worker was enjoying looked better than my rabbit food, but maybe next time. All in all, the side salad was a perfect combo to the otherwise healthy lunch. Once I had finished my meal, I was satisfied; was I stuffed? No. But it was just the right amount.
