I was initially a little skeptical about the savory and sweet combination, but it worked out fantastically well: the slightly salty pistachio ice cream offset the super sweet double fudge (and chocolate chip half I snagged from my friend) nicely.\n\nTheir ice cream alone can't stand up to the likes of Humphry and Mr & Mrs, but was definitely tastier than that of CREAM. Their cookies, on the other hand, were quite tasty on their own, though a little inconsistent in texture: the chocolate chip was nice and soft, while the double fudge was harder. Whether this was due to higher demand and thus, faster turnover for the former, or just a matter of how the cookies are made, I'm uncertain.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The venue's pretty small, with slightly higher counter seating up front, and a few regular two tops in the back, that are perfectly accessible.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-08-10"}], "plain lowfat frozen yogurt": [], "chocolate chip cookies": [{"excerpts": ["I also got the cookies n cream and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies for my sandwich.

I was in the area and paypal was offering a deal for Over the Moon, so I just couldn't resist.\n\nParking in the marina could be a bit difficult depending on the time of day and what day of the week, but in general, the marina is a pretty busy place. It's all street parking or residential parking. You really have to test your luck and patience here.\n\nThey have a great ice cream selection here. I ended up getting the coffee caramel crunch with chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies. Their ice cream sandwiches are only $4! Personally, the cookies were way too sweet for me. But they were soft baked cookies which I like. But I LOVED their ice cream. They also had Andes mint ice cream which was chocolate ice cream with bits of andes chocolates. This was also one of my faves, the chocolate was rich and not too sweet, reminded me of a fudgsicle and the subtle hint of mint was delicious. They also have the cookie monster flavor which is blue colored vanilla ice cream with bits of chocolate chip cookies, how adorable! They also have other unique flavors like honey lavender and earl grey.\n\nService was meh. The girl that helped us was definitely not happy to be working on a Saturday night. I came with the bf after dinner and he ordered himself a bag of cookies. I was ordering separately to use my Paypal offer. After helping him, she went ahead and just stood behind the register on her phone! I felt bad for interrupting her but I asked to try some flavors. After sampling, she asked me if I was going to order something with some attitude in her tone of voice. Of course I was going to order something! Why else would I still be standing there after sampling ice cream flavors?! Afterwards, she went to the back and left the front unattended. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me. A group of people walked in right after she left too and they weren't helped until another work came back out.\n\nThe only good thing here was their ice cream.
