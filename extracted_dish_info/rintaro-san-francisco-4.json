"], "author": "Angela M.", "review": "A coworker of mine recommended Rintaro to me based off of places she knows I love (Ippuku, Soba Ichi). I called to make a reservation on Friday the 14th at 5:02 pm; I was put on hold for over five minutes and when the hostess came back and I told her I wanted to make a reservation for Saturday evening, if possible, she said, \"Oookaaayy, let me see what we have...\" in a tone that could only be described as exasperated and annoyed.\n\nWhen she asked my first and last name for the 6:00 pm reservation, I said, \"Angela, [brief pause] and the last name is [slowly] M as in Mary, A-R-R-U-J-O.\" The hostess replied, \"Ok, what was the first name?\" I said, \"Angela.\" She then quickly, confidently, and in the same annoyed tone said, \"And the last name is M-I-R-R-A-G-O.\" I paused so I wouldn't snap and said, \"M-A-R-R-U-J-O,\" and pronounced it (the J is pronounced as an H). She said back, \"Marrugo.\" I said, \"No. Marrujo.\" She repeated it back correctly.\n\nWhen we showed up for our reservation, my last name was Marrugo in their system.\n\nNot a good first impression.\n\nLuckily the rest of the night was markedly better. Rintaro is a beautiful restaurant: high ceilings, minimal, modern Japanese styling, light wood, and lots of natural light even into the later evening hours. The courtyard in the front of the restaurant is peaceful, and it looks like Rintaro offers lap blankets for patrons eating outdoors when the evenings get chilly.\n\nFirst things first: I highly recommend making a reservation, even if you have to deal with the unpleasant, unprofessional hostess I spoke with. Two women who walked in ahead of us tried to get a table without a reservation and were told it would be an hour and forty-five minute wait. When I called to make a reservation, the only two slots available were for 6:00 pm and 9:15 pm.\n\nRintaro's menu has an interesting, varied array of food. On Mondays, Rintaro offers yakitori tenju, and on Tuesdays they serve okonomiyaki. Their main menu changes daily. We went with the yosedofu ($10), hanetsuki gyoza ($15), mabodofu don ($14), kama tama udon ($12), nakatani no kakiage ($15), and the momotaro shukuriimu ($12).\n\nOur waitress highly suggested the yosedofu (house-made, fresh tofu), which was the first dish of the night to come out. The tofu was creamy and cold, and tasted delicious with the accompanying shoyu, ginger, and scallions.\n\nThe hanetsuki gyoza came next, which was the most visually interesting gyoza I've ever ordered. A crispy, edible layer (of what, I'm not sure) housed the gyoza and looked almost like a net, with a bunch of greens laid over the top. The menu claims this dish includes chicken feet jelly and \"wings\"; if there was chicken feet jelly in the gyoza I couldn't tell you what that tastes like, specifically, nor do I know what \"wings\" means in this context. But the gyoza were delicious and so was the dipping sauce, so I suppose ultimately that's what matters most, but I was thrown off by how vague the description of this dish was.\n\nThe nakatani no kakiage came out while we were still eating the gyoza. It was a mix of greens and scallops deep fried in tempura batter. This dish was impressive in how flavorful it was for being so simple. It's also the first time I've had scallops I've actually liked, as the scallops were sweet and not at all fishy or briny in flavor. The tempura remained light and crisp and not too oily.\n\nOur final two dishes, the mabodofu don and the kama tama udon, were very impressive and so, so good. If you like mapo tofu, you'll more than likely enjoy mabodofu don. It's essentially the same dish but doesn't contain the numbing spice of Szechuan mapo tofu. The ground pork was flavored so well and the tofu was a perfect amount of firm while still maintaining creaminess. The kama tama udon was an interesting take on pasta carbonara, with Rintaro's own hand-rolled udon served with a single egg yolk, butter, ginger, scallions, and shaved katsuobushi (or bonito flakes). Once everything was mixed together the dish really was the Japanese version of carbonara and was delicately but significantly flavorful.\n\nDessert was the momotaro shukuriimu, which was a large cream puff pastry with peach ice cream and blackberry sauce. I'm not much of a cream puff fan so my boyfriend ate the majority of it, but it was sweet and light and well baked. I focused more on the ice cream, which had large chunks of peaches, and went well with that tasty blackberry sauce.\n\nService at Rinatro was spot on. Our waitress was nice without being annoying, attentive without being overbearing, and every other waitress that came around to either bring out dishes or clear plates was informative and kind. There was little wait between dishes, and it never felt like we were sitting around waiting for our food. Everything was paced well. I also appreciated that the dish for our dessert was chilled, keeping everything from melting prematurely.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Rintaro.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-09-22"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered: yosedofu (housemade silken tofu), tuna sashimi, tsukune (chicken meatball skewers), ten layer pork katsu, mapo tofu with rice, and the hand rolled udon with fish cake.

What the shit is that? A cold wet towel I've already rubbed my filthy hands all over is not what I want as a napkin.\n\nHandmade udon! Haven't had this since my favorite place for that in Torrance started using store-bought udon (and I consequently stopped going).\n\nWas disappointed it wasn't nearly as good here, though. Just glad the carbonara had no cream or peas in it (pet peeve of mine is people who think carbonara is a cream sauce with peas). The udon with white wine clam sauce at Musha in West LA is the best wafu udon I've ever had and is consistently good.\n\nYosedofu (house-made tofu) $10 - I've had this many places and this was fine but did not stand out. \n\nGyoza was not on the menu but they had it. If we hadn't overheard the waitress at another table we wouldn't have known. Wish she would have told us too.\n\nThey turned out not great, though. They were shaped like Chinese dumplings, but a kind I don't like, and had a dough \"skirt\" (like Squeeze Burgers' cheese skirt), which is a thing in some regions of China that just isn't for me. When I want Chinese dumplings I'll go to a Chinese restaurant - preferably in NY, HK, or LA, not SF. When I order gyoza I want Japanese dumplings.\n\nYakitori are 2 skewers per order, which imho is too many because I want to try a bunch of them and this way I only have room for half what I normally could order. There were 2 not on the menu, tail (pope's nose or parson's nose if you're British - \"Open this door! We're British!\"), which was just okay, a little dry, and soft bone, which was really crunchy and hard to eat and had small bits of dried out meat clinging to it.\n\nThe regular chicken meat we had (thigh with onion, oyster) was too dry.\n\nLiver: the sauce was too sweet. This is better at Gaku.\n\nKanzuri (throat) was our favorite. Chewy, fatty, lots of umami.

The paper straw was really think and got too soggy to use after 2 sips.\n\nThis was a 2-2.5 for food but the waitress was great and i want to differentiate it from Nihon Whisky's 2, so a 3 it is. But don't mistake this for a pure 3.\n\n~\n\nUpdate: the food was meh enough that I was going to give it a 2 (\"meh\" rating according to Yelp's own descriptions of star levels) but it wasn't as bad as Nihon Whisky Lounge and I wanted to delineate the difference using my star ratings so it got a 3. But then the owner or manager or whoever of Nihon Whisky was so unprofessional in their response to me that I bumped them down to a 1. I was going to come back and give Rintarou a 2, but now that I think about it, the waitress went out of her way to help track down a missing order after last call, so I can't in good conscience bump Rintarou down another notch.

On one hand, I like getting to sample a variety of dishes and it's great for sharing among a group. On the other hand, prices are almost always excessive compared to portion size, and I often end up feeling slightly underfed, ripped-off, or both. Rintaro largely manages to sidestep that conflict for me by making up for it with amazing ambiance, presentation, and menu selection.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden away behind a very non-descript gate, but walk inside and you instantly feel like you've been transported into a cozy, relaxing bistro in Japan.

Knowing that we wanted Japanese food, our options were limited -- that is, unless we were willing to wait. Orenchi Beyond came up as an idea, but please see aforementioned regarding wait time.\n\nThen, the BF reminded me of Chef Val Cantu's suggestion from our dinner at Californios the weekend prior and we decided to check our Izakaya Rintaro. We were a bit disappointed upon arrival to find we would have to wait 40 minutes for a table; thinking on our feet, we quickly drove over to Ken Ken Ramen to see if their seating was any better but no such luck. Having killed 15-20 minutes by this time, we drove back to Rintaro and luckily, some space cleared up in the front by the bar for the 3 of us. I was seated in a slightly awkward position, being in the middle of 2 differently leveled bar tops, but I managed to get by.\n\nUnlike other restaurants that call themselves Izakaya and don't actually serve tapa style bites, Rintaro hits the nail on the head. Chungah behind the bar ended up serving us as they were quite busy and likely wanted to reserve table tops for larger groups (speculating based on other reviews I've read). She took our drink orders and placed small dishes of pickled herring before us to munch on as we reviewed the menu. Here's what we ended up ordering:\n\n+ hanetsuki gyoza - pork potstickers, made from scratch. Beautiful presentation with a nice, chewy consistency on the dough with a flavorful pork filling. \n- yakitori tsukune - chicken meatballs; extremely tender, but I tasted lemongrass and not being a fan of that particular flavor, wouldn't call this one my favorite.\n+ liver - likely the best grilled liver I've ever had that was remained tender (and wasn't overcooked to a rubbery texture)\n + tender + wasabi - this was medium rare! Small dollops of wasabi tracked the chicken skewer which were a nice touch. \n- thigh + scallion - neutral on this dish; I bit the scallion off the skewer and the inside layers of it flew out which was a bit embarrassing for me.\n+ kabocha croquettes - breading and fry was made to perfection; I wish I could use that breading on everything.\n+ keihan - rice with chicken broth, chicken breast, and shredded egg. Extremely hearty and great for a cold day. Lots of flavor which I imagine is due to reducing the broth to achieve it's rich and dark color. We were also given a 2nd bowl because someone had misordered, gratis!\n+ tamago - large order; light and fluffy, the chef has apparently been mastering his tamago skills for several years. Served with a topping of minced radish on the side for texture.\n\nThey were out of the yosedofu (silken tofu), skin yakitori, chanterelle mushrooms, and the fried swordfish, which was disappointing. I guess next time we need to get there earlier!\n \nWhat elevated our experience was sitting at the bar, talking to Chungah about the restaurant. She made what would likely have been a good dining experience, into an extraordinary night. Her cousin runs the restaurant with the chef, who previously worked under Alice Waters of Chez Panisse, and she shared some additional background about the restaurant style and philosophy. \n\nChez Spencer used to inhabit this space, but they never reopened after a fire broke out. In fact, Rintaro kept some of the burnt wood from the fire and incorporated it into the restaurant design. Len Brackett, a well-renowned architect, had saved the cedar wood used for the bar and table tops for years and years, but finally let Rintaro's owner use it to design the restaurant. What's even more impressive is that the cedar wood hasn't been oiled and was made smooth by a Japanese planing beam. The brass bars in the bathroom and bar area were built by Chungah herself.

Let me summarize this review by saying that Nina and I actually had a debate at the end of our meal about whether we should give this place 2 or 3 stars. I've settled in the middle with 2.5 stars only because I thought the food was excellent, but I would not come back here again if it keeps up their horrible and awkward service.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I was not greeted. Not that I'm trying to be pretentious about this, but I made eye contact with several waitresses, and they all ignored me. Fortunately it was easy to find Nina, sitting at the barstool area. I'll also take this moment to note that the chairs were small and uncomfortable, even though I'm a relatively tiny person. The plus side of the restaurant setup is that they have a beautiful front courtyard with seating.\n\nAs for food, we checked yakitori off our list. Our selections included Rintaro Tsukune, Thigh and Onion, and Chicken Oyster. These were super fresh and made right in front of us. Delicious! We also got the Kama Tama Udon, which is udon carbonara with ginger, scallion, butter, and shaved katsuobushi, topped with a freshly cracked raw egg. This was a small portion but still tasty. The textures and mixture of flavors were on point.\n\nBack to the service. Nina and I are generally patient people and try to understand that restaurants get busy, but there were SO many staff members working there, and it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to ask about drinks or generally make us feel welcome. Perhaps it's the hands-off culture of the place. Who knows? Then once our cocktails were brought, it felt like another 15 more minutes to gather our food order. \n\nDuring our meal, I felt uncomfortable when the waitresses kept reaching over me without my permission to clear dishes and wipe the table unnecessarily. I appreciate the attempt at service, but it was done with zero tact. Is it too much to ask for basic human interaction? And as predicted, it took forever to get the bill.

Rintaro certainly doesn't need my help, but rather has just consistently surpassed our expectations every visit, enough so that this is the least I could do.\n \nI truly believe Rintaro is one of the most special, unique places in San Francisco. While Al's Place, Lazy Bear, etc. pop up in the news regularly, somehow Rintaro remains a relatively under-the-radar gem. Having eaten at many of the top spots in the city, I believe they care as much or more about their food than any other top restaurant in SF. Whether it's painstakingly made Udon, the greatest Tamago I've had always (at least every time I've been) prepared by Chef Brackett himself (and not frequently enough on the menu), some of the most consistently fantastic Yakitori I've seen including my time in Japan (and maybe the best variety of chicken bits in SF, make sure you ask if anything isn't on the menu), even to the home made tofu and plum wine in their cocktails, there is a level of detail and love not always shared by Rintaro's peers.\n \nBut even beyond the food, the experience is unparalleled. Where you may wait in the crowded front room at Al's, at Rintaro you are welcomed by a beautiful garden scene somehow hidden from the unsightly streets just outside. As you arrive and leave, you will often be thanked by both the wait staff and the cooks behind the counter for your patronage. And if you go for a special occasion (we just did our anniversary), you may be able to slip a special request (ours was having Tamago on the menu - and it wasn't, but rather a special order was prepared and served to us as a first course), you may even luck out with a complimentary drink or two before your meal, and if you're fortunate enough, maybe even a quick hello from Chef Brackett. And it is this, the complete experience, that sets Rintaro apart.\n \nWhen you go, in case it wasn't obvious, order at least one piece of chicken you wouldn't normally (kanzuri or hearts perhaps?). If you can, ask for a seat at the counter where you can see the chefs' attention to detail in action. Don't just get a beer (although I usually do), inquire about which cocktail is your host's favorite or would pair best with your meal.

Even before they opened at 5:30 pm, there was a line so come early. \n\nRintaro serves izakaya, Japanese tapas. Compared to other izakaya restaurants I've been to, Rintaro's menu is smaller and more focused: http://bit.ly/1sIfHaQ. Usually, the rule of thumb is to order about 3-4 dishes per a person and then a finisher like a bowl of ramen or don (they only have don, rice bowls on the menu). The alkie menu is pretty limited with just two beers and three sake/shochu options (my beer was $10.50 a bottle!). It's not cheap here; our bill for two including tip was $176. =X\n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Complimentary Boiled Peanuts: http://bit.ly/1BgJfFN\n*Hanetsuki Gyoza: Berkshire Pork Gyoza (6 for $12): http://bit.ly/1u5Oa63\n*Yakitori Chef's Choice: Tsukune, Thigh, Thigh w/ onion, Gizzard, Wing & Mushroom ($15.50): http://bit.ly/1sIgtUj\n*Yakitori: Skin & Gizzard ($6, $5.50): http://bit.ly/1xBnbSn\n*Yakitori: Liberty Duck ($6): http://bit.ly/1xBnooE\n*Kare No Karaage: Crispy Fried Sole ($22): http://bit.ly/1EGfkp1\n*Keihan: Rice w/ chicken broth, chicken breast, shiso & egg ($6.50): http://bit.ly/1v8cDe4 \n*Santa Barbara Uni Donburi (off the menu - $8): http://bit.ly/1yCrWJQ\n*Kaki Yonashi Kanten: Persimmon & Wine-Poached Pear Jelly w/ vanilla ice cream & brown sugar reduction ($8.75): http://bit.ly/1sIhA6u\n\nAs with any newly opened restaurant, there are bound to be kinks so it was nice that they provided complimentary boiled peanuts (sweet and savory) for us to nosh on while we waited for our order. \n\nIt's rare to find housemade gyoza on the menu, and Rintaro's rendition didn't disappoint. The thick skin had a toothsome chew with a nice, crispy browned bottom, and the pork filling was juicy and flavorful. However, the wrapper broke apart when picking up with chopsticks and the filling fell out of the gyoza.\n\nThe highlight of their izakaya menu are their yakitori skewers. Every yakitori we had was uber tender, subtly smoky, and lightly seasoned with tare (soy basting sauce) or shio (salt). Mr. NSS' loved the gizzards so much that we ordered two additional orders. \n\nThe best bang for your buck is the kare no karaage: crispy fried sole which is served whole and you can eat everything including the bones. Forget your chopsticks and use your hands to break apart the crunchy fish with tender flesh. We really enjoyed this dish as it was satisfying and not greasy at all. Great frying technique. \n\nThe dishes we were most excited about were the most disappointing dishes of the night. The uni don (off the menu because it's limited) was basically one slab of uni over a bowl of rice served alongside strips of nori and soy. While the uni was deliciously sweet and briny, the rice was dry and hard, and not palatable. For $8, it would have been nice to elevate the don like with an onsen tamago (Japanese hot spring egg). The keihan didn't fare any better. It was like a bland chicken porridge. \n\nDessert did redeem the disappointing finishers. The persimmon and pear jelly were refreshing with concentrated flavors that was prominent yet subtle. Loved the vanilla ice cream which I showered with the brown sugar reduction. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nThe staff was nice and polite but it was confusing because it didn't seem like they had assigned tables.

Otherwise, they will stagger your order and won't fire up something unless you're done with a particular course.\n\nOne thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was as we were leaving, we passed by several of the staff including the hostess and no one bothered to say, \"bye\" or thank us for coming. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nMy gf and I celebrated our birthdays at Chez Spencer and the new space was unrecognizable; clean, zen, and with lots of light natural woods.

No wonder this place (and its chef) has received \"best\" awards by numerous critics, media, and average folks like me.  Everything is cooked to perfection, and the sashimi is the freshest and most flavorful around.  The vibe is low-key and cozy, and the service is friendly and fantastic.  We sat at the counter and enjoyed watching the different people do their assigned tasks of grilling, frying, slicing, skewering, and plating so gracefully -- all the while smiling and making conversation and ensuring that we were being attended to.  \nThings to try: the skewers (we had meatballs, gizzards, and livers -- amazing), whole fried sole, yellowtail and tuna sashimi, housemade tofu, and housemade udon.  The sake flight was also delicious, thanks to our server's recommendation, as was the green tea panna cotta.  \nThere are a still a ton of dinner options that we wanted to try but are saving for next time; until then, we can't wait to come back and see what lunch is like.

The yosedofu (silken tofu, $7.75) was brightened by crispy scallion and freshly grated ginger and quite good. The uni don was small and poor priced for the amount of uni.\n\nThe service was poor. We made a reservation and then when we went there were no tables free and only very narrow seat at the bar. I made a reservation so we would have a table. They were able to clear one table in the back after we refused to sit at the bar. Then they seem to forget about us. We had to get someone's attention to order and then things came out randomly sometimes 3 dishes at a time then a 15 minute wait for more food.\n\nThe inside space is mostly not wheelchair accessible with booths raised off the floor, narrow walkways, and high stools at the bar.

That being said, also means food came out quicker.  Fun to be able to watch the chefs making the food.  \n\nShungiku Kamo Sarada (hikari farm chrysanthemum greens with grilled duck breast and pluots)($16) - surprisingly a rather filling salad, especially with a good amount of grilled duck breast and a huge pile of the greens.  The pluots added crunch and a bit of acidity.  Even though we shared this, it was a lot of salad; maybe for 3+ people if you are trying to try more dishes\n\nLiver yakitori ($7) - not for everyone, but I liked it out of the three yakitori we ordered.  A little funky tasting and slightly chewy, but I found the texture and flavor interesting.  Seasoned well too.\n\nRintaro Tsukune Yakitori ($8) - yay juicy meatballs!  They give you three per stick (and 2 sticks).  Slightly crusty on the outside but not burned and very tender on the inside.  \n\nKing Trumpet Yakitori ($6) - not too oily and tough; this one was recommended by the waiter and we both liked it.  Very lightly seasoned to let the natural mushroom flavor shine.\n\nHanetsuki Gyoza (Becker Lane Berkshire pork gyoza with chicken foot jelly and \"wings\")($14) - while the dumplings are delicious, this is a rather big portion.  The pork filling was nice and juicy, the outside crispy without being too crunchy, but would probably only get this if you have a larger party or are planning on ordering less dishes.\n\nNijimasu no Shioyaki (whole salt grilled rainbow trout wrapped in a fig leaf with grated daikon and ginger)($34) - again, a massive portion, given it is a huge whole fish being served.  This dish also takes a while to prepare so there was a bit of a wait time between this course and the previous one.  Fish was beautifully cooked- firm but flaky and the fig leaf, daikon and ginger added a lot of bright notes to the fish.  Again, recommended only if you have a large group and are ordering fewer dishes.\n\nHojicha Panna Cotta (Japanese roasted green tea panna cotta with hojicha syrup and almond cookies)($10) - probably the highlight of the meal.  The panna cotta had a great, light but present roasted tea flavor and the hojicha syrup wasn't too sweet.  Not sure if you need the almond cookies but they were good anyway.\n\nIn summary, food is good, but perhaps not as conducive to sharing many plates given the large size of some of the dishes, especially if you have a small party.  Probably better for larger parties if you want to try the entrees, but perhaps smaller groups should stick to the izakaya and smaller dishes so you won't walk away feeling too stuffed.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["On to the yakitori section, I think we had almost everything on the menu: tsukune (chicken meatball), thigh and onion, liver and roast garlic, chicken oyster, knee cap, king trumpet mushroom, kanzuri (chicken bit between the heart the liver), and the ribeye.

I tried one from the person sitting next to us at the bar (my colleague whom I randomly bumped into!).

Rintaro has potential, but has a ways to go. \n\nI must preface by saying this review is strictly based off my experience on Valentine's Day's prix fixe menu. I included each course in my review, but skip to the bottom for the gist. \n\nI was excited when Mr. Rintaro posted a special V-Day menu on Instagram just a few days before. 8 courses for $75/person, not bad. \n\nUpon arrival, the place looks great. From the wooden gateway with their Rintaro stamp logo signage, to the dim lit outdoor rock garden seating area, into the open and bustling kitchen space with bar seating, high ceilings, and traditional style booths in the main room. Of course, my 7:15 reservation landed me in the back room, what looks like a converted storage space that they've decorated with some flower branches, so we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful space and its ambiance, but that's fine, I'm looking forward to the food.\n\n:: The Menu :: \n\nDrinks: Sake flight ($26): 3 beautiful glass cups: 1) Hakkaisan (junmai). 2) Izumo Fuji (junmai). 3) Kinka (daiginjo). The Kinka was my favorite. Also got a cup of hot tea, served in a small tea cup, no teapot included. (Note: not one time did any server come by to refill my tea). \n\n1st course: Radishes with miso & nut paste. The 2 pieces of sliced radish (long leafy stems in tact) was served with 3 sliced carrots (one slice w/ its carrot top in tact) and 2 pieces of endive. The carrots were roughly chopped, and with the stems and carrot tops in tact, it looked sloppy together on the long rectangular plate. Didn't eat the long radish stems or carrot tops. \n\n2nd: Dashimaki tamago. 1 piece per person. Decent job with the rolled egg, a fluffy bite and a classic Japanese menu item. \n\n3rd: Night smelt and nori tempura w/ matcha salt. 3 pieces of smelt tempura each, and 1 nori piece of tempura each. Fried decently, with a dab of matcha salt on the side. (Note: the tempura came out of order on the menu, and when we said to the server we haven't had our sashimi yet, the server seemed a little annoyed, took it back, only to have another lady bring the tempura back to us saying, \"the sashimi takes a little bit longer\". Ok? And we didn't ask to send it back, just an observation that it came out of order. Next.)\n\n4th: California bluefin tuna w/ Half Moon Bay Wasabi & Kushi oysters w/ dashi gelee. 2 pieces of tuna sashimi each, 1 oyster each. The quality of the tuna was there, but it doesn't come with enough wasabi, definitely not enough to taste on all 4 slices of tuna. The oyster with dashi gelee were just ok, it tasted like they could have been sitting out for a while. Kushis are small and we only got 1 each. \n\n5th: BN Ranch New York steak, Liberty duck breast and king trumpets. This dish wasn't what they originally posted on the menu. The duck breast was supposed to be served with hand-rolled udon. I guess the udon wasn't ready, and so they combined the duck with the steak and served it side by side dressed with some baby greens in between. The best part of the dish were the seasoned king trumpet mushrooms sitting under the duck breasts. The steak was medium-to-well, on the chewy side, and pretty hacked up slices. 3 small slices of steak each with some minced daikon to go with it. Duck was also a bit chewy, 1 slice each. Probably the most underwhelming dish of the night since it was the main course, wasn't what they advertised, and it didn't really make sense put together. \n\n6th: Quinalt Nation Steelhead roe over rice w/ shiso. So this was the last course before dessert and it's a lot of white rice and a lot of roe, and a shiso leaf.  The roe was good, and the white rice did fill me up for the time being. Still couldn't help but feel underwhelmed again at this point. \n\n7th: Chocolate almond cake w/ candied rose petals. Baked in the shape of a madeline, 2 pieces each, and 1 rose petal each, served with powdered sugar. Technically a cake, but not the kind you eat with a fork. 2 chocolate madelines for dessert. A disappointing finale. \n\nWrap up:\n\nI came in a follower of Rintaro and Peko Peko. Their presentation & aesthetics are so well done and it gives you the impression that they've got it down. Leaving the dinner, I gotta say I was really disappointed and unimpressed. A lot of the food was just ok, and not one course stood out. The menu was a mish-mash of uninspired dishes. Definitely not the caliber of food to justify the price. The service was friendly, although a bit slow and still learning as they go. \n\nTo be fair, Rintaro is still new to the game, and this was a one-off menu. On the flipside, this was supposed to be a special prix fixe menu for an eventful evening. Don't advertise a special menu if you're going to serve us mediocre, uninspired food, for a higher price no less (w/tip around $250). It only raises more questions about the caliber of Rintaro's food in general. If only they'd shine with their cooking, as they do with their appearance.

First time to try to food. \n\nFirst time I came, didn't make reservations and it was super packed and fully booked.

The atmosphere here is very calming and relaxing. The music is not really my type, traditional Japanese music, but that's the experience right?\n\nSat down by the countertop so I can look at what they doing.

Finally, a great izakaya that I can return regularly, with delicious skewers and small bites to fill your stomach little by little with the progression of the meal. \n\nSit in the main dining room where natural wood booths and skewer bar seats line the two sides of this long dining area. Good lighting/ambience and great service. \n\nThe skewers are excellent. Some are a bit too salty for my taste (gizzard) but for the most part solid. My favorites were chicken heart, chicken liver, chicken thigh with scallion, and King trumpet mushroom which was very moist and flavorful (unlike most other mushroom skewers I had in the past). \n\nWe had also rintaro tsukene (meatball), asparagus and bacon (the asparagus was a bit too big for skewers in my opinion) - I don't really care for these. But the plain asparagus ones that they have in March 2018 was really good - can be seasonal in terms of quality. The kneecap, neck and tail were pretty good but a bit too much tendon / chewy for my taste. \n\nThe chrysanthemum salad with duck was quite delicious - unusual greens and good quality meat. But salads are not the specialty here and according to one regular who is here, describe them to be a bit too saucy. \n\nWe also had the tomago (hot egg omelet) which everyone bragged to us here (it's served off the menu, only available some of the time). It was pretty good and very tender and moist. Make sure that you try it with the daikon with soy sauce to add a bit more flavor. I myself prefer chawamushi (not served here) when it comes to egg-related Japanese dishes. \n\nThe chicken wings are amazing. I tried one from the person sitting next to us at the bar (my colleague whom I randomly bumped into!). It was just the perfectly cooked wings with crispy skin, moist meat, and balanced spices on the outside. It doesn't get better than this when it comes to wings. \n\nIf you are in the mood for sashimi, there is a toro dish with chutoro, otoro, and California blue fin tuna. Great quality.\n\nThe yutofu (silken tofu with maitake, shimeji mushroom, Napa cabbage, etc) was pretty good but it's not a brothy soup, the hot water is only to keep it warm. Solid but not the best. Very clean food. Your stomach and body will thank you for it. \n\nThe kake udon with soft boiled egg and fish cakes were pretty good.

More of the trendier, hipster-ish variety, but no less delicious.  Even if they are a little pricier than most izakayas I've been to...\n\nAlthough their location leaves a bit to be desired (the block isn't sketchy, but it's pretty dark/dead), the restaurant itself is a real gem - a well-lit, open patio that gives way to a dark, cozy restaurant space.  While sitting outside would've bee fine, I was stoked that we snagged the last two seats at the counter/bar (there are some tables/booths inside as well).  \n\nAs for the menu, it changes fairly regularly, though there are a handful of staples (like the Teba No Karaage) that consistently appear.  The range of offerings is similar to that of other izakayas, but the ingredients/products used are of better quality than most.  More importantly, everything tasted great!\n\n-- INGEN NO KURUMI AE - Dirty Girl French Beans with Rich Walnutty Sauce...$8 (small)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=JQqoU-v0ki0KfVTLaq3mYw)\nFor what it's worth - I thought this was \"good but not great\", yet this was one of my friend's favorites.  The taste of it wasn't bad at all, I just wasn't super high on the nuttiness of the sauce.  While it added a sort of creaminess, it also felt like it was covering up the beans.\n\n-- LIBERTY DUCK SKEWER...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=oSEZzFjp7P_VKOS8uFGjTg)\nTasty, but definitely pricey.  Although the coloring was a little dark, the meat was juicy (the bit of fat and skin on it helped) and full of that luscious, duck flavor.  The only thing missing?  More of the crisped up duck skin.  A great skewer choice, otherwise.\n\n-- CHICKEN BREAST + WASABI SKEWER...$7\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=J13S4YQOVGT7rPtUn-IzZg)\nThe least interesting part of our meal, though it wasn't bad.  The breast was decently moist, and I liked the kick from the wasabi.  However, it's very basic - lightly seasoned chicken and wasabi.  Given that, despite the dish's lack of flaws, $7 is a bit hefty for just two skewers.\n\n-- GINDARA SUNOMONO - Cucumber and Miso-cured Bolinas Black Cod in Sweet Vinegar with New Ginger...$13\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=E0KGpWNxifOjHA7JorIowA)\nBlack cod is one of my favorite foods and this one was done really well.  The fish had that wonderful silkiness to it and tasted so good.  What's more, the cucumbers and vinegar added a sweet acidity that complemented the fish quite nicely.  I just wish we had a bigger piece!\n\n-- TEBA NO KARAAGE - Japanese Fried Chicken Wings with Smokey Tare, Sanshio Pepper and Curly Cress...$9 (small)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=650cn3z4uAwfXRVW6nCSSg)\nThe one dish we knew we had to get and it didn't disappoint...mostly.  The wings (piping hot and moist) were coated with a light batter that had a terrific crispiness to it.  However, while the overall taste was great, it could have used more of the sauce to enhance the sweet/salty contrast.\n\n-- TEUCHI UDON - Hand-Rolled Udon with Two Fishes Broth, Scallions and Nori (with Hot Spring Egg added)...$9 (+$2)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=6tV1tb-WaN_ZID4dTDD0bQ)\nSimple, but really good.  The noodles had the perfect bite to them and, while not necessary, the egg added a wonderful richness.  Still, the broth was the star - a lot of delicious, subtle flavors yet not a lot of fishiness.  The best udon I've had in SF, though I wouldn't have objected to some tempura.\n\n-- HOJICHA PANNA COTTA - Japanese Roasted Green Tea Panna Cotta with Hojicha Syrup and Sesame Almond Cookies...$9\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=YGnfpb3Dhvh1XGSDRY_s2A)\nWhat a way to end our meal!  As with several of our dishes, the flavors were delicate, but no less robust.  The panna cotta had a strong taste of green tea and the syrup added the perfect amount of sweetness.  Plus, I loved the taste and crunchiness of the cookie.  GET THIS.\n\nWhile I can see why some would say Izakaya Rintaro's prices are a bit high, only the skewers felt \"pricey\" to me, as the rest felt somewhat justified.  If you're still concerned though, I might suggest avoiding the skewers and sticking with their specialty dishes.  And the dessert.  Whatever you do, get the dessert!

Even before they opened at 5:30 pm, there was a line so come early. \n\nRintaro serves izakaya, Japanese tapas. Compared to other izakaya restaurants I've been to, Rintaro's menu is smaller and more focused: http://bit.ly/1sIfHaQ. Usually, the rule of thumb is to order about 3-4 dishes per a person and then a finisher like a bowl of ramen or don (they only have don, rice bowls on the menu). The alkie menu is pretty limited with just two beers and three sake/shochu options (my beer was $10.50 a bottle!).

The thick skin had a toothsome chew with a nice, crispy browned bottom, and the pork filling was juicy and flavorful. However, the wrapper broke apart when picking up with chopsticks and the filling fell out of the gyoza.\n\nThe highlight of their izakaya menu are their yakitori skewers. Every yakitori we had was uber tender, subtly smoky, and lightly seasoned with tare (soy basting sauce) or shio (salt). Mr. NSS' loved the gizzards so much that we ordered two additional orders. \n\nThe best bang for your buck is the kare no karaage: crispy fried sole which is served whole and you can eat everything including the bones. Forget your chopsticks and use your hands to break apart the crunchy fish with tender flesh. We really enjoyed this dish as it was satisfying and not greasy at all. Great frying technique. \n\nThe dishes we were most excited about were the most disappointing dishes of the night. The uni don (off the menu because it's limited) was basically one slab of uni over a bowl of rice served alongside strips of nori and soy. While the uni was deliciously sweet and briny, the rice was dry and hard, and not palatable. For $8, it would have been nice to elevate the don like with an onsen tamago (Japanese hot spring egg). The keihan didn't fare any better. It was like a bland chicken porridge. \n\nDessert did redeem the disappointing finishers. The persimmon and pear jelly were refreshing with concentrated flavors that was prominent yet subtle. Loved the vanilla ice cream which I showered with the brown sugar reduction. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nThe staff was nice and polite but it was confusing because it didn't seem like they had assigned tables.

Otherwise, they will stagger your order and won't fire up something unless you're done with a particular course.\n\nOne thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was as we were leaving, we passed by several of the staff including the hostess and no one bothered to say, \"bye\" or thank us for coming. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nMy gf and I celebrated our birthdays at Chez Spencer and the new space was unrecognizable; clean, zen, and with lots of light natural woods.

Knowing that we wanted Japanese food, our options were limited -- that is, unless we were willing to wait. Orenchi Beyond came up as an idea, but please see aforementioned regarding wait time.\n\nThen, the BF reminded me of Chef Val Cantu's suggestion from our dinner at Californios the weekend prior and we decided to check our Izakaya Rintaro. We were a bit disappointed upon arrival to find we would have to wait 40 minutes for a table; thinking on our feet, we quickly drove over to Ken Ken Ramen to see if their seating was any better but no such luck. Having killed 15-20 minutes by this time, we drove back to Rintaro and luckily, some space cleared up in the front by the bar for the 3 of us. I was seated in a slightly awkward position, being in the middle of 2 differently leveled bar tops, but I managed to get by.\n\nUnlike other restaurants that call themselves Izakaya and don't actually serve tapa style bites, Rintaro hits the nail on the head. Chungah behind the bar ended up serving us as they were quite busy and likely wanted to reserve table tops for larger groups (speculating based on other reviews I've read). She took our drink orders and placed small dishes of pickled herring before us to munch on as we reviewed the menu. Here's what we ended up ordering:\n\n+ hanetsuki gyoza - pork potstickers, made from scratch. Beautiful presentation with a nice, chewy consistency on the dough with a flavorful pork filling. \n- yakitori tsukune - chicken meatballs; extremely tender, but I tasted lemongrass and not being a fan of that particular flavor, wouldn't call this one my favorite.\n+ liver - likely the best grilled liver I've ever had that was remained tender (and wasn't overcooked to a rubbery texture)\n + tender + wasabi - this was medium rare! Small dollops of wasabi tracked the chicken skewer which were a nice touch. \n- thigh + scallion - neutral on this dish; I bit the scallion off the skewer and the inside layers of it flew out which was a bit embarrassing for me.\n+ kabocha croquettes - breading and fry was made to perfection; I wish I could use that breading on everything.\n+ keihan - rice with chicken broth, chicken breast, and shredded egg. Extremely hearty and great for a cold day. Lots of flavor which I imagine is due to reducing the broth to achieve it's rich and dark color. We were also given a 2nd bowl because someone had misordered, gratis!\n+ tamago - large order; light and fluffy, the chef has apparently been mastering his tamago skills for several years. Served with a topping of minced radish on the side for texture.\n\nThey were out of the yosedofu (silken tofu), skin yakitori, chanterelle mushrooms, and the fried swordfish, which was disappointing. I guess next time we need to get there earlier!\n \nWhat elevated our experience was sitting at the bar, talking to Chungah about the restaurant. She made what would likely have been a good dining experience, into an extraordinary night. Her cousin runs the restaurant with the chef, who previously worked under Alice Waters of Chez Panisse, and she shared some additional background about the restaurant style and philosophy. \n\nChez Spencer used to inhabit this space, but they never reopened after a fire broke out. In fact, Rintaro kept some of the burnt wood from the fire and incorporated it into the restaurant design. Len Brackett, a well-renowned architect, had saved the cedar wood used for the bar and table tops for years and years, but finally let Rintaro's owner use it to design the restaurant. What's even more impressive is that the cedar wood hasn't been oiled and was made smooth by a Japanese planing beam. The brass bars in the bathroom and bar area were built by Chungah herself. These small touches, beautiful atmosphere, and attentive service along with the well-executed food made for a great night with the BF and old roomie.

"], "author": "Terry L.", "review": "I have sort of a conflicted relationship with izakaya-style (essentially Japanese gastropub or tapas-style small bites) restaurants. On one hand, I like getting to sample a variety of dishes and it's great for sharing among a group. On the other hand, prices are almost always excessive compared to portion size, and I often end up feeling slightly underfed, ripped-off, or both. Rintaro largely manages to sidestep that conflict for me by making up for it with amazing ambiance, presentation, and menu selection.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden away behind a very non-descript gate, but walk inside and you instantly feel like you've been transported into a cozy, relaxing bistro in Japan. The decor all feels very natural with bamboo fences, interesting plants, and elegant light wood-focused interior design that looks like it was taken straight from Japan. Even the bathroom locks with a nice sliding wooden bar, which I thought was a cool touch.\n\nAs for the food, you really can't go wrong in ordering. I tried the yosedofu (incredibly clean-tasting), thigh, chicken oyster (highly recommended), and liver yakitori, teba no karaage (fried chicken), pork katsu, kama tama udon (\"carbonara\"-style without broth), and the panna cotta for dessert (very interesting texture, almost egg-like with mild syrup poured over and seeping into it, great for sharing). I'll only say that the udon was a little underwhelming for the price, but the yakitori and fried dishes really hit the spot. Sadly they were out of croquettes, but I'll have to try those next time.\n\nThis place would be a great choice for a date or a small group (ideally four). It's busy and small enough to feel lively, but the tables are separated enough and the noise level is well-suited for boisterous conversation without having to shout. Rintaro is definitely a gem in the SoMa/upper Mission area, and after dinner you can pop in next door at Nihon Whisky Lounge (provided you have cash to burn, but that's a topic for another review).", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-04-01"}, {"excerpts": ["What i recommend:\n- chicken tail\n- chicken neck\n- fried smelt\n- chicken oyster\n- chicken meatball\n- chicken heart\n\n"], "author": "Christina C.", "review": "We have an addiction to Izakayas and this place was better than we expected... by a lot!

On that list is the yakitori from Izakaya Rintaro, so naturally she added this place to our calendar of food adventures and made a reservation. Let me summarize this review by saying that Nina and I actually had a debate at the end of our meal about whether we should give this place 2 or 3 stars. I've settled in the middle with 2.5 stars only because I thought the food was excellent, but I would not come back here again if it keeps up their horrible and awkward service.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I was not greeted. Not that I'm trying to be pretentious about this, but I made eye contact with several waitresses, and they all ignored me. Fortunately it was easy to find Nina, sitting at the barstool area. I'll also take this moment to note that the chairs were small and uncomfortable, even though I'm a relatively tiny person. The plus side of the restaurant setup is that they have a beautiful front courtyard with seating.\n\nAs for food, we checked yakitori off our list. Our selections included Rintaro Tsukune, Thigh and Onion, and Chicken Oyster. These were super fresh and made right in front of us. Delicious! We also got the Kama Tama Udon, which is udon carbonara with ginger, scallion, butter, and shaved katsuobushi, topped with a freshly cracked raw egg. This was a small portion but still tasty. The textures and mixture of flavors were on point.\n\nBack to the service. Nina and I are generally patient people and try to understand that restaurants get busy, but there were SO many staff members working there, and it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to ask about drinks or generally make us feel welcome. Perhaps it's the hands-off culture of the place. Who knows? Then once our cocktails were brought, it felt like another 15 more minutes to gather our food order. \n\nDuring our meal, I felt uncomfortable when the waitresses kept reaching over me without my permission to clear dishes and wipe the table unnecessarily. I appreciate the attempt at service, but it was done with zero tact. Is it too much to ask for basic human interaction? And as predicted, it took forever to get the bill. I could spend hours talking to Nina, but something about the experience at this restaurant screamed sleepy and slow. It was so miserable having to be here for so long and sitting in this uncomfortable chair.

On one hand, I like getting to sample a variety of dishes and it's great for sharing among a group. On the other hand, prices are almost always excessive compared to portion size, and I often end up feeling slightly underfed, ripped-off, or both. Rintaro largely manages to sidestep that conflict for me by making up for it with amazing ambiance, presentation, and menu selection.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden away behind a very non-descript gate, but walk inside and you instantly feel like you've been transported into a cozy, relaxing bistro in Japan. The decor all feels very natural with bamboo fences, interesting plants, and elegant light wood-focused interior design that looks like it was taken straight from Japan. Even the bathroom locks with a nice sliding wooden bar, which I thought was a cool touch.\n\nAs for the food, you really can't go wrong in ordering. I tried the yosedofu (incredibly clean-tasting), thigh, chicken oyster (highly recommended), and liver yakitori, teba no karaage (fried chicken), pork katsu, kama tama udon (\"carbonara\"-style without broth), and the panna cotta for dessert (very interesting texture, almost egg-like with mild syrup poured over and seeping into it, great for sharing). I'll only say that the udon was a little underwhelming for the price, but the yakitori and fried dishes really hit the spot. Sadly they were out of croquettes, but I'll have to try those next time.\n\nThis place would be a great choice for a date or a small group (ideally four). It's busy and small enough to feel lively, but the tables are separated enough and the noise level is well-suited for boisterous conversation without having to shout.

Interesting interplay of flavors. The crisp fresh scallion was the cherry on top.\n\nHOUSE DISH\n* Dashimaki Tamago (fancy folded omelet w/ riverdog farm eggs & freshly shaved katsuobushi dashi. $9) - 3 stars\nLackluster for this restaurant. Texture was soft but very one-dimensional flavor-wise. \n\nSIMMERED\n* Gyu Suji Nikomi (Marin sun beef shank & tendon simmered w/ daikon, ginger & black yamaki miso. $14) - 4 stars\nA heavier dish for izakaya, but the meat is so soft.

We all loved this too - a thick yet light breading. \n\n* Kabocha Korokke (curry kabocha & potato croquettes w/ acme panko & snowy cabbage. $11) - 4.5 stars\nSuch a unique dish! The breading has layers upon layers of thin crisp. The potato inside has a soft contrast.

The taste of it wasn't bad at all, I just wasn't super high on the nuttiness of the sauce.  While it added a sort of creaminess, it also felt like it was covering up the beans.\n\n-- LIBERTY DUCK SKEWER...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=oSEZzFjp7P_VKOS8uFGjTg)\nTasty, but definitely pricey.  Although the coloring was a little dark, the meat was juicy (the bit of fat and skin on it helped) and full of that luscious, duck flavor.  The only thing missing?  More of the crisped up duck skin.  A great skewer choice, otherwise.\n\n-- CHICKEN BREAST + WASABI SKEWER...$7\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=J13S4YQOVGT7rPtUn-IzZg)\nThe least interesting part of our meal, though it wasn't bad.  The breast was decently moist, and I liked the kick from the wasabi.  However, it's very basic - lightly seasoned chicken and wasabi.  Given that, despite the dish's lack of flaws, $7 is a bit hefty for just two skewers.\n\n-- GINDARA SUNOMONO - Cucumber and Miso-cured Bolinas Black Cod in Sweet Vinegar with New Ginger...$13\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=E0KGpWNxifOjHA7JorIowA)\nBlack cod is one of my favorite foods and this one was done really well.

The wings (piping hot and moist) were coated with a light batter that had a terrific crispiness to it.

The noodles had the perfect bite to them and, while not necessary, the egg added a wonderful richness.  Still, the broth was the star - a lot of delicious, subtle flavors yet not a lot of fishiness.  The best udon I've had in SF, though I wouldn't have objected to some tempura.\n\n-- HOJICHA PANNA COTTA - Japanese Roasted Green Tea Panna Cotta with Hojicha Syrup and Sesame Almond Cookies...$9\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=YGnfpb3Dhvh1XGSDRY_s2A)\nWhat a way to end our meal!  As with several of our dishes, the flavors were delicate, but no less robust.  The panna cotta had a strong taste of green tea and the syrup added the perfect amount of sweetness.  Plus, I loved the taste and crunchiness of the cookie.

Rintaro is a beautiful restaurant: high ceilings, minimal, modern Japanese styling, light wood, and lots of natural light even into the later evening hours. The courtyard in the front of the restaurant is peaceful, and it looks like Rintaro offers lap blankets for patrons eating outdoors when the evenings get chilly.\n\nFirst things first: I highly recommend making a reservation, even if you have to deal with the unpleasant, unprofessional hostess I spoke with. Two women who walked in ahead of us tried to get a table without a reservation and were told it would be an hour and forty-five minute wait. When I called to make a reservation, the only two slots available were for 6:00 pm and 9:15 pm.\n\nRintaro's menu has an interesting, varied array of food. On Mondays, Rintaro offers yakitori tenju, and on Tuesdays they serve okonomiyaki. Their main menu changes daily. We went with the yosedofu ($10), hanetsuki gyoza ($15), mabodofu don ($14), kama tama udon ($12), nakatani no kakiage ($15), and the momotaro shukuriimu ($12).\n\nOur waitress highly suggested the yosedofu (house-made, fresh tofu), which was the first dish of the night to come out. The tofu was creamy and cold, and tasted delicious with the accompanying shoyu, ginger, and scallions.\n\nThe hanetsuki gyoza came next, which was the most visually interesting gyoza I've ever ordered. A crispy, edible layer (of what, I'm not sure) housed the gyoza and looked almost like a net, with a bunch of greens laid over the top. The menu claims this dish includes chicken feet jelly and \"wings\"; if there was chicken feet jelly in the gyoza I couldn't tell you what that tastes like, specifically, nor do I know what \"wings\" means in this context. But the gyoza were delicious and so was the dipping sauce, so I suppose ultimately that's what matters most, but I was thrown off by how vague the description of this dish was.\n\nThe nakatani no kakiage came out while we were still eating the gyoza. It was a mix of greens and scallops deep fried in tempura batter. This dish was impressive in how flavorful it was for being so simple. It's also the first time I've had scallops I've actually liked, as the scallops were sweet and not at all fishy or briny in flavor. The tempura remained light and crisp and not too oily.\n\nOur final two dishes, the mabodofu don and the kama tama udon, were very impressive and so, so good. If you like mapo tofu, you'll more than likely enjoy mabodofu don. It's essentially the same dish but doesn't contain the numbing spice of Szechuan mapo tofu. The ground pork was flavored so well and the tofu was a perfect amount of firm while still maintaining creaminess. The kama tama udon was an interesting take on pasta carbonara, with Rintaro's own hand-rolled udon served with a single egg yolk, butter, ginger, scallions, and shaved katsuobushi (or bonito flakes). Once everything was mixed together the dish really was the Japanese version of carbonara and was delicately but significantly flavorful.\n\nDessert was the momotaro shukuriimu, which was a large cream puff pastry with peach ice cream and blackberry sauce. I'm not much of a cream puff fan so my boyfriend ate the majority of it, but it was sweet and light and well baked. I focused more on the ice cream, which had large chunks of peaches, and went well with that tasty blackberry sauce.\n\nService at Rinatro was spot on. Our waitress was nice without being annoying, attentive without being overbearing, and every other waitress that came around to either bring out dishes or clear plates was informative and kind. There was little wait between dishes, and it never felt like we were sitting around waiting for our food. Everything was paced well. I also appreciated that the dish for our dessert was chilled, keeping everything from melting prematurely.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Rintaro.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-09-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Especially Hanetsuki gyoza and Udon.

"], "author": "Audrey H.", "review": "Decent upscale Japanese izakaya style; mind the larger portions (albeit delicious)!\n\nCame here with a date late Thursday night as a walk-in; we probably waited 15 min for a seat and were seated at the counter right in front of the grill for the yakitori.  \n\nVenue / Service: we were seated pretty near to the cashier and the kitchen so we experienced a lot of traffic where we were.  That being said, also means food came out quicker.  Fun to be able to watch the chefs making the food.  \n\nShungiku Kamo Sarada (hikari farm chrysanthemum greens with grilled duck breast and pluots)($16) - surprisingly a rather filling salad, especially with a good amount of grilled duck breast and a huge pile of the greens.  The pluots added crunch and a bit of acidity.  Even though we shared this, it was a lot of salad; maybe for 3+ people if you are trying to try more dishes\n\nLiver yakitori ($7) - not for everyone, but I liked it out of the three yakitori we ordered.  A little funky tasting and slightly chewy, but I found the texture and flavor interesting.  Seasoned well too.\n\nRintaro Tsukune Yakitori ($8) - yay juicy meatballs!  They give you three per stick (and 2 sticks).  Slightly crusty on the outside but not burned and very tender on the inside.  \n\nKing Trumpet Yakitori ($6) - not too oily and tough; this one was recommended by the waiter and we both liked it.  Very lightly seasoned to let the natural mushroom flavor shine.\n\nHanetsuki Gyoza (Becker Lane Berkshire pork gyoza with chicken foot jelly and \"wings\")($14) - while the dumplings are delicious, this is a rather big portion.  The pork filling was nice and juicy, the outside crispy without being too crunchy, but would probably only get this if you have a larger party or are planning on ordering less dishes.\n\nNijimasu no Shioyaki (whole salt grilled rainbow trout wrapped in a fig leaf with grated daikon and ginger)($34) - again, a massive portion, given it is a huge whole fish being served.  This dish also takes a while to prepare so there was a bit of a wait time between this course and the previous one.  Fish was beautifully cooked- firm but flaky and the fig leaf, daikon and ginger added a lot of bright notes to the fish.  Again, recommended only if you have a large group and are ordering fewer dishes.\n\nHojicha Panna Cotta (Japanese roasted green tea panna cotta with hojicha syrup and almond cookies)($10) - probably the highlight of the meal.  The panna cotta had a great, light but present roasted tea flavor and the hojicha syrup wasn't too sweet.  Not sure if you need the almond cookies but they were good anyway.\n\nIn summary, food is good, but perhaps not as conducive to sharing many plates given the large size of some of the dishes, especially if you have a small party.  Probably better for larger parties if you want to try the entrees, but perhaps smaller groups should stick to the izakaya and smaller dishes so you won't walk away feeling too stuffed.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Dishes I'd recommend:\n- Hanetsuki Gyoza $14\n- Hotate no Sashimi (I love raw scallop) $20\n- Kama Tama Udon $12\n- Yosedofu (house-made tofu!)

Even before they opened at 5:30 pm, there was a line so come early. \n\nRintaro serves izakaya, Japanese tapas. Compared to other izakaya restaurants I've been to, Rintaro's menu is smaller and more focused: http://bit.ly/1sIfHaQ. Usually, the rule of thumb is to order about 3-4 dishes per a person and then a finisher like a bowl of ramen or don (they only have don, rice bowls on the menu). The alkie menu is pretty limited with just two beers and three sake/shochu options (my beer was $10.50 a bottle!). It's not cheap here; our bill for two including tip was $176. =X\n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Complimentary Boiled Peanuts: http://bit.ly/1BgJfFN\n*Hanetsuki Gyoza: Berkshire Pork Gyoza (6 for $12): http://bit.ly/1u5Oa63\n*Yakitori Chef's Choice: Tsukune, Thigh, Thigh w/ onion, Gizzard, Wing & Mushroom ($15.50): http://bit.ly/1sIgtUj\n*Yakitori: Skin & Gizzard ($6, $5.50): http://bit.ly/1xBnbSn\n*Yakitori: Liberty Duck ($6): http://bit.ly/1xBnooE\n*Kare No Karaage: Crispy Fried Sole ($22): http://bit.ly/1EGfkp1\n*Keihan: Rice w/ chicken broth, chicken breast, shiso & egg ($6.50): http://bit.ly/1v8cDe4 \n*Santa Barbara Uni Donburi (off the menu - $8): http://bit.ly/1yCrWJQ\n*Kaki Yonashi Kanten: Persimmon & Wine-Poached Pear Jelly w/ vanilla ice cream & brown sugar reduction ($8.75): http://bit.ly/1sIhA6u\n\nAs with any newly opened restaurant, there are bound to be kinks so it was nice that they provided complimentary boiled peanuts (sweet and savory) for us to nosh on while we waited for our order. \n\nIt's rare to find housemade gyoza on the menu, and Rintaro's rendition didn't disappoint. The thick skin had a toothsome chew with a nice, crispy browned bottom, and the pork filling was juicy and flavorful. However, the wrapper broke apart when picking up with chopsticks and the filling fell out of the gyoza.\n\nThe highlight of their izakaya menu are their yakitori skewers. Every yakitori we had was uber tender, subtly smoky, and lightly seasoned with tare (soy basting sauce) or shio (salt). Mr. NSS' loved the gizzards so much that we ordered two additional orders. \n\nThe best bang for your buck is the kare no karaage: crispy fried sole which is served whole and you can eat everything including the bones. Forget your chopsticks and use your hands to break apart the crunchy fish with tender flesh. We really enjoyed this dish as it was satisfying and not greasy at all. Great frying technique. \n\nThe dishes we were most excited about were the most disappointing dishes of the night. The uni don (off the menu because it's limited) was basically one slab of uni over a bowl of rice served alongside strips of nori and soy. While the uni was deliciously sweet and briny, the rice was dry and hard, and not palatable. For $8, it would have been nice to elevate the don like with an onsen tamago (Japanese hot spring egg). The keihan didn't fare any better. It was like a bland chicken porridge. \n\nDessert did redeem the disappointing finishers. The persimmon and pear jelly were refreshing with concentrated flavors that was prominent yet subtle. Loved the vanilla ice cream which I showered with the brown sugar reduction. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nThe staff was nice and polite but it was confusing because it didn't seem like they had assigned tables.

Otherwise, they will stagger your order and won't fire up something unless you're done with a particular course.\n\nOne thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was as we were leaving, we passed by several of the staff including the hostess and no one bothered to say, \"bye\" or thank us for coming. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nMy gf and I celebrated our birthdays at Chez Spencer and the new space was unrecognizable; clean, zen, and with lots of light natural woods.

Orenchi Beyond came up as an idea, but please see aforementioned regarding wait time.\n\nThen, the BF reminded me of Chef Val Cantu's suggestion from our dinner at Californios the weekend prior and we decided to check our Izakaya Rintaro. We were a bit disappointed upon arrival to find we would have to wait 40 minutes for a table; thinking on our feet, we quickly drove over to Ken Ken Ramen to see if their seating was any better but no such luck. Having killed 15-20 minutes by this time, we drove back to Rintaro and luckily, some space cleared up in the front by the bar for the 3 of us. I was seated in a slightly awkward position, being in the middle of 2 differently leveled bar tops, but I managed to get by.\n\nUnlike other restaurants that call themselves Izakaya and don't actually serve tapa style bites, Rintaro hits the nail on the head. Chungah behind the bar ended up serving us as they were quite busy and likely wanted to reserve table tops for larger groups (speculating based on other reviews I've read). She took our drink orders and placed small dishes of pickled herring before us to munch on as we reviewed the menu. Here's what we ended up ordering:\n\n+ hanetsuki gyoza - pork potstickers, made from scratch. Beautiful presentation with a nice, chewy consistency on the dough with a flavorful pork filling. \n- yakitori tsukune - chicken meatballs; extremely tender, but I tasted lemongrass and not being a fan of that particular flavor, wouldn't call this one my favorite.\n+ liver - likely the best grilled liver I've ever had that was remained tender (and wasn't overcooked to a rubbery texture)\n + tender + wasabi - this was medium rare! Small dollops of wasabi tracked the chicken skewer which were a nice touch. \n- thigh + scallion - neutral on this dish; I bit the scallion off the skewer and the inside layers of it flew out which was a bit embarrassing for me.\n+ kabocha croquettes - breading and fry was made to perfection; I wish I could use that breading on everything.\n+ keihan - rice with chicken broth, chicken breast, and shredded egg. Extremely hearty and great for a cold day. Lots of flavor which I imagine is due to reducing the broth to achieve it's rich and dark color. We were also given a 2nd bowl because someone had misordered, gratis!\n+ tamago - large order; light and fluffy, the chef has apparently been mastering his tamago skills for several years. Served with a topping of minced radish on the side for texture.\n\nThey were out of the yosedofu (silken tofu), skin yakitori, chanterelle mushrooms, and the fried swordfish, which was disappointing. I guess next time we need to get there earlier!\n \nWhat elevated our experience was sitting at the bar, talking to Chungah about the restaurant. She made what would likely have been a good dining experience, into an extraordinary night. Her cousin runs the restaurant with the chef, who previously worked under Alice Waters of Chez Panisse, and she shared some additional background about the restaurant style and philosophy. \n\nChez Spencer used to inhabit this space, but they never reopened after a fire broke out. In fact, Rintaro kept some of the burnt wood from the fire and incorporated it into the restaurant design. Len Brackett, a well-renowned architect, had saved the cedar wood used for the bar and table tops for years and years, but finally let Rintaro's owner use it to design the restaurant. What's even more impressive is that the cedar wood hasn't been oiled and was made smooth by a Japanese planing beam. The brass bars in the bathroom and bar area were built by Chungah herself.

Good lighting/ambience and great service. \n\nThe skewers are excellent. Some are a bit too salty for my taste (gizzard) but for the most part solid. My favorites were chicken heart, chicken liver, chicken thigh with scallion, and King trumpet mushroom which was very moist and flavorful (unlike most other mushroom skewers I had in the past). \n\nWe had also rintaro tsukene (meatball), asparagus and bacon (the asparagus was a bit too big for skewers in my opinion) - I don't really care for these. But the plain asparagus ones that they have in March 2018 was really good - can be seasonal in terms of quality. The kneecap, neck and tail were pretty good but a bit too much tendon / chewy for my taste. \n\nThe chrysanthemum salad with duck was quite delicious - unusual greens and good quality meat. But salads are not the specialty here and according to one regular who is here, describe them to be a bit too saucy. \n\nWe also had the tomago (hot egg omelet) which everyone bragged to us here (it's served off the menu, only available some of the time). It was pretty good and very tender and moist. Make sure that you try it with the daikon with soy sauce to add a bit more flavor.

I tried one from the person sitting next to us at the bar (my colleague whom I randomly bumped into!).

I called to make a reservation on Friday the 14th at 5:02 pm; I was put on hold for over five minutes and when the hostess came back and I told her I wanted to make a reservation for Saturday evening, if possible, she said, \"Oookaaayy, let me see what we have...\" in a tone that could only be described as exasperated and annoyed.\n\nWhen she asked my first and last name for the 6:00 pm reservation, I said, \"Angela, [brief pause] and the last name is [slowly] M as in Mary, A-R-R-U-J-O.\" The hostess replied, \"Ok, what was the first name?\" I said, \"Angela.\" She then quickly, confidently, and in the same annoyed tone said, \"And the last name is M-I-R-R-A-G-O.\" I paused so I wouldn't snap and said, \"M-A-R-R-U-J-O,\" and pronounced it (the J is pronounced as an H). She said back, \"Marrugo.\" I said, \"No. Marrujo.\" She repeated it back correctly.\n\nWhen we showed up for our reservation, my last name was Marrugo in their system.\n\nNot a good first impression.\n\nLuckily the rest of the night was markedly better. Rintaro is a beautiful restaurant: high ceilings, minimal, modern Japanese styling, light wood, and lots of natural light even into the later evening hours. The courtyard in the front of the restaurant is peaceful, and it looks like Rintaro offers lap blankets for patrons eating outdoors when the evenings get chilly.\n\nFirst things first: I highly recommend making a reservation, even if you have to deal with the unpleasant, unprofessional hostess I spoke with. Two women who walked in ahead of us tried to get a table without a reservation and were told it would be an hour and forty-five minute wait. When I called to make a reservation, the only two slots available were for 6:00 pm and 9:15 pm.\n\nRintaro's menu has an interesting, varied array of food. On Mondays, Rintaro offers yakitori tenju, and on Tuesdays they serve okonomiyaki. Their main menu changes daily. We went with the yosedofu ($10), hanetsuki gyoza ($15), mabodofu don ($14), kama tama udon ($12), nakatani no kakiage ($15), and the momotaro shukuriimu ($12).\n\nOur waitress highly suggested the yosedofu (house-made, fresh tofu), which was the first dish of the night to come out. The tofu was creamy and cold, and tasted delicious with the accompanying shoyu, ginger, and scallions.\n\nThe hanetsuki gyoza came next, which was the most visually interesting gyoza I've ever ordered. A crispy, edible layer (of what, I'm not sure) housed the gyoza and looked almost like a net, with a bunch of greens laid over the top. The menu claims this dish includes chicken feet jelly and \"wings\"; if there was chicken feet jelly in the gyoza I couldn't tell you what that tastes like, specifically, nor do I know what \"wings\" means in this context. But the gyoza were delicious and so was the dipping sauce, so I suppose ultimately that's what matters most, but I was thrown off by how vague the description of this dish was.\n\nThe nakatani no kakiage came out while we were still eating the gyoza. It was a mix of greens and scallops deep fried in tempura batter. This dish was impressive in how flavorful it was for being so simple. It's also the first time I've had scallops I've actually liked, as the scallops were sweet and not at all fishy or briny in flavor. The tempura remained light and crisp and not too oily.\n\nOur final two dishes, the mabodofu don and the kama tama udon, were very impressive and so, so good. If you like mapo tofu, you'll more than likely enjoy mabodofu don. It's essentially the same dish but doesn't contain the numbing spice of Szechuan mapo tofu. The ground pork was flavored so well and the tofu was a perfect amount of firm while still maintaining creaminess. The kama tama udon was an interesting take on pasta carbonara, with Rintaro's own hand-rolled udon served with a single egg yolk, butter, ginger, scallions, and shaved katsuobushi (or bonito flakes). Once everything was mixed together the dish really was the Japanese version of carbonara and was delicately but significantly flavorful.\n\nDessert was the momotaro shukuriimu, which was a large cream puff pastry with peach ice cream and blackberry sauce. I'm not much of a cream puff fan so my boyfriend ate the majority of it, but it was sweet and light and well baked. I focused more on the ice cream, which had large chunks of peaches, and went well with that tasty blackberry sauce.\n\nService at Rinatro was spot on. Our waitress was nice without being annoying, attentive without being overbearing, and every other waitress that came around to either bring out dishes or clear plates was informative and kind. There was little wait between dishes, and it never felt like we were sitting around waiting for our food. Everything was paced well.

I tried the yosedofu (incredibly clean-tasting), thigh, chicken oyster (highly recommended), and liver yakitori, teba no karaage (fried chicken), pork katsu, kama tama udon (\"carbonara\"-style without broth), and the panna cotta for dessert (very interesting texture, almost egg-like with mild syrup poured over and seeping into it, great for sharing). I'll only say that the udon was a little underwhelming for the price, but the yakitori and fried dishes really hit the spot. Sadly they were out of croquettes, but I'll have to try those next time.\n\nThis place would be a great choice for a date or a small group (ideally four). It's busy and small enough to feel lively, but the tables are separated enough and the noise level is well-suited for boisterous conversation without having to shout. Rintaro is definitely a gem in the SoMa/upper Mission area, and after dinner you can pop in next door at Nihon Whisky Lounge (provided you have cash to burn, but that's a topic for another review).", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-04-01"}, {"excerpts": ["We also got the Kama Tama Udon, which is udon carbonara with ginger, scallion, butter, and shaved katsuobushi, topped with a freshly cracked raw egg.

On that list is the yakitori from Izakaya Rintaro, so naturally she added this place to our calendar of food adventures and made a reservation. Let me summarize this review by saying that Nina and I actually had a debate at the end of our meal about whether we should give this place 2 or 3 stars. I've settled in the middle with 2.5 stars only because I thought the food was excellent, but I would not come back here again if it keeps up their horrible and awkward service.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I was not greeted. Not that I'm trying to be pretentious about this, but I made eye contact with several waitresses, and they all ignored me. Fortunately it was easy to find Nina, sitting at the barstool area. I'll also take this moment to note that the chairs were small and uncomfortable, even though I'm a relatively tiny person. The plus side of the restaurant setup is that they have a beautiful front courtyard with seating.\n\nAs for food, we checked yakitori off our list. Our selections included Rintaro Tsukune, Thigh and Onion, and Chicken Oyster. These were super fresh and made right in front of us. Delicious! We also got the Kama Tama Udon, which is udon carbonara with ginger, scallion, butter, and shaved katsuobushi, topped with a freshly cracked raw egg. This was a small portion but still tasty. The textures and mixture of flavors were on point.\n\nBack to the service. Nina and I are generally patient people and try to understand that restaurants get busy, but there were SO many staff members working there, and it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to ask about drinks or generally make us feel welcome. Perhaps it's the hands-off culture of the place. Who knows? Then once our cocktails were brought, it felt like another 15 more minutes to gather our food order. \n\nDuring our meal, I felt uncomfortable when the waitresses kept reaching over me without my permission to clear dishes and wipe the table unnecessarily. I appreciate the attempt at service, but it was done with zero tact. Is it too much to ask for basic human interaction? And as predicted, it took forever to get the bill. I could spend hours talking to Nina, but something about the experience at this restaurant screamed sleepy and slow. It was so miserable having to be here for so long and sitting in this uncomfortable chair.

I love izakaya food and given my high expectations I tend not to attempt any visits unless highly recommended because I usually expect to be disappointed. And so, I have very little to compare Rintaro with in terms of izakaya spots specifically in San Francisco. Overall as an izakaya goes, it's pretty good to me, but just don't go expecting levels of what you'd get in japan. I'd say this is like \"average\" Izakaya level in japan to me.\n\nThat said, most dishes here were super solid, and a few I'd come back for. Oddly, their yakitori to me was not their best dish. As we came with a sizable group, we ordered at least half the menu. A few memorable dishes in order of how much I liked them:\n\n1: chicken katsu with cheese - perfectly crisp and fried just long enough at the right temperature that there was no greasy after taste and the cheese was nice and melted, juicy meat.\n2: curry croquette - again, fried perfectly, and the flavors worked\n3: udon carbonara - ok this isn't THAT small some pictures make this look like it's one mouthful worth of noodles but you could share it between 3 if you all just wanted a few bites for a taste. It was good. But there's no cheese in this it's really just butter and egg and dashi. Japanese flavors + butter and yolk for sure. \n4: Tsukune skewers (chicken meatballs) - by far the best of the \"standard\" grilled skewer dishes. The others were not so flavorful. Thighs were fine.\n5: okra skewers - only because I love okra! \n6: this was quite bad - leaf baked whole fish. Too dry, and the server deboning it said it was the first time she was deboning but kind of massacred the fish and left too many bones. We felt bad since she kept saying it was her first time and so didn't complain but it wasn't so good. Anyway, the meat was dry. Definitely the most disappointing dish.\n7: hojicha panna cotta is actually way up there for me but saving it for last because it's dessert. It was amazing. Flavors really came through \n8: momotaro choux cream (shukurimu is how they spell it) was underwhelming. I did not get the taste of momo (peach) at all. Which I expected since that's part of its name!! \n\nOk anyway, I wouldn't come here with a big group because there's no space up front for a group and you'll inevitably be shoved in the room at the back and it gets really stuffy and dark even when it's freezing out! I got really upset about it because I don't enjoy eating in an uncomfortable space and I was feeling stuffy and a little claustrophobic. But otherwise, food was really decent, and it just might be the best izakaya spot in the city. Temper your expectations though!

That being said, also means food came out quicker.  Fun to be able to watch the chefs making the food.  \n\nShungiku Kamo Sarada (hikari farm chrysanthemum greens with grilled duck breast and pluots)($16) - surprisingly a rather filling salad, especially with a good amount of grilled duck breast and a huge pile of the greens.  The pluots added crunch and a bit of acidity.  Even though we shared this, it was a lot of salad; maybe for 3+ people if you are trying to try more dishes\n\nLiver yakitori ($7) - not for everyone, but I liked it out of the three yakitori we ordered.  A little funky tasting and slightly chewy, but I found the texture and flavor interesting.  Seasoned well too.\n\nRintaro Tsukune Yakitori ($8) - yay juicy meatballs!  They give you three per stick (and 2 sticks).  Slightly crusty on the outside but not burned and very tender on the inside.  \n\nKing Trumpet Yakitori ($6) - not too oily and tough; this one was recommended by the waiter and we both liked it.  Very lightly seasoned to let the natural mushroom flavor shine.\n\nHanetsuki Gyoza (Becker Lane Berkshire pork gyoza with chicken foot jelly and \"wings\")($14) - while the dumplings are delicious, this is a rather big portion.  The pork filling was nice and juicy, the outside crispy without being too crunchy, but would probably only get this if you have a larger party or are planning on ordering less dishes.\n\nNijimasu no Shioyaki (whole salt grilled rainbow trout wrapped in a fig leaf with grated daikon and ginger)($34) - again, a massive portion, given it is a huge whole fish being served.  This dish also takes a while to prepare so there was a bit of a wait time between this course and the previous one.  Fish was beautifully cooked- firm but flaky and the fig leaf, daikon and ginger added a lot of bright notes to the fish.  Again, recommended only if you have a large group and are ordering fewer dishes.\n\nHojicha Panna Cotta (Japanese roasted green tea panna cotta with hojicha syrup and almond cookies)($10) - probably the highlight of the meal.  The panna cotta had a great, light but present roasted tea flavor and the hojicha syrup wasn't too sweet.  Not sure if you need the almond cookies but they were good anyway.\n\nIn summary, food is good, but perhaps not as conducive to sharing many plates given the large size of some of the dishes, especially if you have a small party.  Probably better for larger parties if you want to try the entrees, but perhaps smaller groups should stick to the izakaya and smaller dishes so you won't walk away feeling too stuffed.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Hojicha panna cotta - you have to try this!

A great skewer choice, otherwise.\n\n-- CHICKEN BREAST + WASABI SKEWER...$7\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=J13S4YQOVGT7rPtUn-IzZg)\nThe least interesting part of our meal, though it wasn't bad.  The breast was decently moist, and I liked the kick from the wasabi.  However, it's very basic - lightly seasoned chicken and wasabi.  Given that, despite the dish's lack of flaws, $7 is a bit hefty for just two skewers.\n\n-- GINDARA SUNOMONO - Cucumber and Miso-cured Bolinas Black Cod in Sweet Vinegar with New Ginger...$13\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=E0KGpWNxifOjHA7JorIowA)\nBlack cod is one of my favorite foods and this one was done really well.  The fish had that wonderful silkiness to it and tasted so good.  What's more, the cucumbers and vinegar added a sweet acidity that complemented the fish quite nicely.  I just wish we had a bigger piece!\n\n-- TEBA NO KARAAGE - Japanese Fried Chicken Wings with Smokey Tare, Sanshio Pepper and Curly Cress...$9 (small)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=650cn3z4uAwfXRVW6nCSSg)\nThe one dish we knew we had to get and it didn't disappoint...mostly.  The wings (piping hot and moist) were coated with a light batter that had a terrific crispiness to it.  However, while the overall taste was great, it could have used more of the sauce to enhance the sweet/salty contrast.\n\n-- TEUCHI UDON - Hand-Rolled Udon with Two Fishes Broth, Scallions and Nori (with Hot Spring Egg added)...$9 (+$2)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=6tV1tb-WaN_ZID4dTDD0bQ)\nSimple, but really good.  The noodles had the perfect bite to them and, while not necessary, the egg added a wonderful richness.  Still, the broth was the star - a lot of delicious, subtle flavors yet not a lot of fishiness.  The best udon I've had in SF, though I wouldn't have objected to some tempura.\n\n-- HOJICHA PANNA COTTA - Japanese Roasted Green Tea Panna Cotta with Hojicha Syrup and Sesame Almond Cookies...$9\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=YGnfpb3Dhvh1XGSDRY_s2A)\nWhat a way to end our meal!  As with several of our dishes, the flavors were delicate, but no less robust.  The panna cotta had a strong taste of green tea and the syrup added the perfect amount of sweetness.  Plus, I loved the taste and crunchiness of the cookie.  GET THIS.\n\nWhile I can see why some would say Izakaya Rintaro's prices are a bit high, only the skewers felt \"pricey\" to me, as the rest felt somewhat justified.  If you're still concerned though, I might suggest avoiding the skewers and sticking with their specialty dishes.  And the dessert.  Whatever you do, get the dessert!  That alone would be reason enough for me to come back.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-01-03"}, {"excerpts": ["The hojicha panna cotta is fantastic!

We had a beer, chicken meat balls, and salmon wrapped in a Persimmon (?) leaf.  All that was great - and a good start to our meal.  The courtyard was small and cute, and suitable for this type of event and good for those waiting for a table inside.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful - simple in some ways, but lots of details in others.  My friend and I sat at the bar, and we had fun eating and watching everyone in the kitchen cooking.\n\nHere's what we had:\n- Kumkuat Champagne cocktail\n- Sake flight\n- Maguro\n- Small Dashi Maki Tamago (exceptionally good - one of my favorites. Somehow they made a normal almost-always overlooked item into a hit)\n- Yakitori items: Chicken gizzard, liver, kneecap, thigh meat\n- Teuchi Udon (another favorite - the udon must be house-made.  I definitely will come back to order this)\n- Hojicha Panna Cotta (again, I loved this dish. It has such a nice green tea flavor in both the panna cotta and the syrup that you pour over it. The panna cotta also had a great texture, and this dish is not overly sweet)\n\nOverall this meal for the two of us set us back $120 before tip AND excluding what we ate in the courtyard.  The bill would have been much higher if I brought my husband.  It's not a big meal, but if you want some good izakaya food that is good across the board, make this a special treat.  OR you can grab and drink and snack here, rather than a meal, to bring down the cost - but it's definitely worth a stop.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-06"}, {"excerpts": ["We were almost too stuffed to get dessert, but we're glad we didn't skip because the hojicha panna cotta was certainly a highlight.

It's tucked away in the Mission and could be hard to miss if you aren't looking for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed right off of the bat was the decor and the ambiance. There is some truly amazing carpentry / wood working details that went into the build of this place. My sister said it smelled just like the hot onsens (hot springs) in Japan, and she didn't mean it in a bad way! The wood gives off such a nice warm, musky smell and it totally compliments the added aroma of grilled meat. \n\nWe ordered quite a few items: shishito peppers, gindara sunomono (black cod with cucumber salad), teba no karaage (japanese fried chicken wings) chiizu tori katsu (chicken katsu with cheese and cabbage), and some standard robata items such as meatball, thighand scallion. For dessert we had the hojicha panna cotta (green tea panna cotta). \n\nOddly enough the items that stood out to me the most were the items that I figured would be the most disappointing: shishito peppers; incredibly fresh, grilled and smokey perfection with great crunch. the karaage was OUT of this WORLD! Such a great flavor to the skin and just fried in the best sort of way. The meatball was also surprisingly full of flavor and totally surprised me.. but probably the best thing of all was DESSERT. And trust me, I am not a dessert person and I usually pass on it. But this came out in such a strange presentation that I had to try it. You pour a sort of hojicha syrup (which I suppose was suppose to be like maple syrup but infused with TEA!?) on top of the panna cotta and it just tastes divine... \n\nI would literally return just for the karaage and the dessert. I am eager to see if they will change their menu depending on the seasons. Although the meal was thoroughly enjoyable, I thought they were lacking some more interesting items on the menu so it would be nice if they did change it up a bit.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["the dishes i remember:\n\ntamago (sweet, fluffy egg)\nwhole grilled fish\ngrilled nigiri\na bunch of yakitori\nhojicha panna cotta\n\nvery friendly and polite servers.
