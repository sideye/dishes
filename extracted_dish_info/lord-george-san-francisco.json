Jason(?), our bartender, was courteous and kept an eye out for us in case we needed anything. \n\nWe ordered drinks first, mine was a Manhattan and it came out perfect.  I got similar feedback from my friends regarding their drinks, a minted mule, a mojito and I forgot what the last one was but I think it was a gold rush. For food, we ordered a dozen mixed oysters and they came out on a raised, iced tray with 3 different sauces (one had soy sauce, one had vinegar, and the last was cocktail, none plain, all altered to compliment the oysters). The oysters were chilled, fresh and very tasty, although we ordered a dozen I could've eaten a 100. We also ordered some fries and they came out great. They came with a side of ketchup and mayo but the mayo seemed either made from scratch or something was added which did not turn out bad at all.  We enjoyed the drinks so much our \"one drink, we're in a hurry\" turned into an \"alright, one more lets get a cobra Kai\" which was a tasty and unique drink that came out tasting like oranges, lemons and chocolate.

The reviews for Lord George looked pretty good, so we decided to try it out.\n\nWhen we arrived, the kitchen was closing (so most of the main menu was unavailable to us), but our server told us that there were a few things we could still order. So order we did.\n\nThe charcuterie plate was good. We had 3 meats and 2 cheeses, and added the asparagus to that as well. The asparagus was great. There's no way to screw up cured meats and cheese (unless you offer bad selections), so that was a win.\n\nWe also ordered some french fries to share. They were good, but again, a side dish that's hard to mess up.\n\nI had two glasses of wine, both of which I enjoyed.\n\nTwo of us also order the clam chowder. This is where it went south (record scratch!). Not trying to sound overly sensationalistic, but I've had better chowder out of a can. It was watery with very little flavour, the clams were rubbery (perhaps forgivable since it was the end of the night for their kitchen), but essentially I got a big bowl of potatoes. The menu described it as being made with bacon (as a good chowder should), but instead, we got bacon bits crumbled on top. No smoky flavour in the soup. In fact, no flavour at all.\n\nWe also had the tuna tartare, and to be quite frank, this was the most disappointing tuna tartare I've ever had. The fish seemed fresh enough, but there were too many cucumbers, and the avocado was nowhere near ripe enough. On top of that, there seemed to be no flavour in it at all -- just completely bland (see a theme here?).\n\nI'm not completely writing them off, as I didn't get to try their mains, and we caught them at a time which might not have allowed them to put their best foot forward. But between the lousy chowder and tartare, and the grim, unwelcoming, snarky attitude of our server (don't worry, the rest of the staff were nice), I would have to be pretty desperate not to immediately go elsewhere.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-06-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Highly recommend the French 75, husband had a gin martini.

They are half priced during HH, so they were $1.58 each making them $3.16 at full price. The oysters were crisp, creamy and clean with a nice briny flavor. My favorite way to eat them was just with some lemon and hot sauce. My friend got a HH beer and I got a HH cava. Though they charged me for a Rose which I didn't notice til after we left. Oh well, it's only a dollar difference.\n\n*Rye Manhattan: rye, Italian vermouth, bitters ($12) x2\n*Carlsberg ($6)\n*Money For Nothin': bonded rye, reposado tequila, pineau de charentes, ginger, grapefruit, lemon, walnut bitters\n*Nikka coffey still ($14)\n*Cobra Kai: Japanese whiskey, cocoa, ancho chile, vino aperitivo, citrus, honey, bitters ($14)\n*Highland park 12 year ($14)\n*Springbank 12 year cask strength ($15)\n\nWe spent a good two hours at Lord George, so I needed some drinks! I love the rye manhattan. It was nice and strong and not too sweet. After that, I just stuck with straight ours. I wanted Oban 14, but they didn;t have it. So I got a highland park 12 and nikka coffey.\n\n*French fries ($6): meyer lemon aioli\n*Ham & Cheese ($13): prosciutto, gruyere, egg\n*Clam Chowder ($15 bowl): manila clam, bacon, toast\n\nWe got a couple snacks as well. I only tried the clam chowder. I really only wanted a cup, but a friend of mine wanted to have some as well so we ordered the bowl. This bowl is huge, so unless you want A LOT of soup, a cup should be fine. It had a nice savory flavor due to the bacon and lots of clams, but it was a little too salty for me. And I love salty food!\n\nGreat place for HH. If you can make it by 6pm, order the HH oysters!
