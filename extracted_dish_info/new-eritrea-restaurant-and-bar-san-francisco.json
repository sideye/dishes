In no less than 15 minutes time, we blazed through:\n\n- The standard romaine lettuce, cucumber salad: doesn't really impact my rating, but I didn't care for the dressing which was like that bottled Kraft Italian crap.\n\n- #16 Okra: sauteed with tomatoes, onions, and spices. They intentionally cook their okra lightly so as to keep it firm, not mushy and super slimy.

Other Yelpers  have found this to be bland, but I quite enjoyed the subtle flavor  and the way that this worked very well with the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the veggies.\n\n- #19 Kantisha: sliced button mushrooms sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and the more Ethiopean spices. We ordered this as medium spicy, but I found it on the mild side...alright, but I think I'd skip it next time to try out something more interesting or traditional like lentils or split peas.\n\n...and of course, the MEAT!\n\n- #7 Kilwa Borho: white meat chicken cooked in a tomato based sauce, which we ordered as medium spicy. Again, the spiciness wasn't all there, but this was still quite tasty. I'm partial to dark meat, so I will probably try the #8 (marinated drumsticks) next time.\n\n- #12 Gored-gored: OMG. It was tenderloin steak tips that straight up tasted like BUTTER. Not beef taste with a butter sauce. It was as if the beef and butter were one in artery-clogging harmony. I raved about this like a madwoman, but others thought that the butter taste was too much. Wimps.\n\nWe scarfed this all down with the generous helpings of injera bread provided (2 per person).

I am Ethiopian-American, and there are subtle distinctions between the two aside from the language and geography. Eritrea was formerly a part of Ethiopia until they won their independence in 1991. However, even before that, there were several historical events that shaped these cultural and food distinctions. For example, Ethiopians eat some dishes that include raw/tartare meat (kitfo, terey siga) and cook with heavier spices. Whereas Eritreans have a heavy Italian influence in their cooking that typically includes a lot of tomato-based stews and will even offer various interpretations of pasta and lasagna dishes.

They did an excellent job accommodating our large group. The service was excellent and the space was open and inviting. Our server was attentive and extremely patient with our specific requests for gluten-free injera (made wholly with 'teff' grain, indigenous to the horn of Africa). Wine glasses remained full and there was a genuine hospitality that we all very much appreciated. Everything was awesome from the service aspect. Unfortunately, the food itself was average. I grew up eating and cooking these dishes and was very excited to show off the delicious flavors that this type of cuisine had to offer to our group. However it didn't meet my expectations.

The food is tremendous, they offer a nice selection of \"unusual\" drinks, and the service is way above average in terms of attentiveness and friendliness.  Even better because the vast majority of the rice and potato eating crowd in the neighborhood is far to dull to try something different - you won't need  a reservation.\n\nWhen dining for two your orders are brought out on a round circular dish similar to a pizza pan.  A slice of Ethiopian/Eritrean bread called injera is laid down first and both entrees are served on the injera and split down the center.

What I thought could have been better: 1) the injera was a bit more sour than I like it - but that is also more authentic (likely that they had a higher ratio of Teff flour) - so it's a matter of preference, 2) the meat was a little overcooked and therefore dry, and 3) the sauces were a bit sour and not as flavorful as I'm used to, but I think they were also healthier (less clarified butter). What I really liked: 1) they had Eritrean + Ethiopian food and I haven't had as much Eritrean before - friend pointed out that Eritrean tends to be creamier (they really cream up the lentils for example), 2) portions were a good size, and 3) I don't usually like okra, but their okra was delicious.\n\nSERVICE: GREAT: Nothing exceptional or unique, but the servers were very nice - didn't rush us but were still attentive and joked around with us a bit. Very friendly.\n\nAMBIANCE: My friend described it as \"Italian restaurant-y\" which I liked and thought was accurate.

The best, by far, was the Kitffo which was served with farmers cheese and collard greens. It was pipping hot and very flavorful. \n\nMy main disappointment was the injera. You were charged extra when ordering more and it wasn't very fresh. I am used to softer injera with a spongy texture - this injera was at least a day or two old which caused it to dry out and become become brittle. The Injera at the bottom of the plate was the worst. Normally my favorite part is to eat the injera at the end which has absorbed all the sauces and spices - But the stale injera deflated this pleasure completely.\n\nSo overall, while I love to eat Ethiopian food and really enjoyed the Kitffo, the slow service and stale injera but a damper on the experience.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-09-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I was excited to see the okra ", "because that's one dish you don't usually get...

I raved about this like a madwoman, but others thought that the butter taste was too much. Wimps.\n\nWe scarfed this all down with the generous helpings of injera bread provided (2 per person). This is some of the best injera I have ever had - subtly tart and riding the delicate line between spongy and firmness in texture. But beware - that stuff really does expand in your stomach, and you'll be feelin' it long after the meal is over.\n\nBut wait, the race wasn't over yet. We knew we still had some eating left in us, so decided to order some meat sambusas, which are like the Eritrean/Ethiopean answer to the empanada. The outer layer was chewy and crispy, with yummy seasoned ground meat inside - even better with the tomato paste-ish condiment. Though they were good at the time, I wasn't so impressed that I would order them again. \n\nPerhaps it was the sweet nectar of the 13% alcohol honey wine. Perhaps it was invokation of the Filipino idiom to \"galit-galit muna,\" in short, \"Shut up, and let's eat now.\" But we tore through that meal like we were running for gold. We were athletes fully into the game,with much of the meal spent grunting, groaning (think Sharapova...yeah, she's tennis. It's still sports, only a minor mixed metaphor), and one word calls out to the food. \"Beef.\" \"Potatoes.\" \"Chicken.\" Alas, the moment went by too fast.

"], "author": "Christine L.", "review": "My friends and I hadn't been planning to eat here, but we're so glad we did! \n\nFirst, I need to establish that this was the first time I've actually HAD Ethiopian food. In fact, in our group of three at the time, only one person has tried any before. So us knowing how to do anything at all during our time there is mostly thanks to her. But whether or not this is a new culinary experience for you, it's a relaxed, low-key place to eat and rest after a busy day.\n\nNew Eritrea Restaurant and Bar is located in the Sunset District, which is frankly where all the TRULY mouthwatering Chinese restaurants are located (seriously, look up Chinese restaurants with \"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, CA\" inputted into Yelp's location bar). But it's not just Chinese cuisine either and New Eritrea proves that. Originally, we had been trying to get into San Tung down the street. But it was the weekend and in the middle of dinner rush, so that wasn't happening. We wandered up and down Irving Street, looking for a place to eat, but the other two places we stopped by also had a very long wait period. New Eritrea was our fourth choice and the first one where we could immediately be seated.\n\nThis is a lovely spot to eat with a lot of options if you are (or with people who are) vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, lactose-intolerant, or are adherent to Muslim or Jewish dietary restrictions. Half of the menu was vegetarian/vegan, with even the meat dishes being vegetable-heavy, and there was no pork dishes. Additionally, the sourdough injera bread was made with teff flour and was great for the friend that was avoiding gluten. \n\nWhen we asked our waitress, she talked about how New Eritrea serves Eritrea food, which is a mix of dishes and flavors from all the surrounding areas/countries around the state of Eritrea in northeast Africa. The most prominent influence, of course, being Ethiopian food. From the way it was explained, the melting pot and blend of cuisines in this manner kinda reminds of the way Singaporean fare came about. We ended up ordering a vegetarian combo platter (though none of us were actually vegetarian), and we all enjoyed it. I was pretty full from eating my own injera as well the injera that was being used as a plate for the combo and splitting one of my friend's leftover bread with the other friend. She ended up still being hungry and ordered more. The injera itself was a treat, as I enjoyed the slight tang of sourness and how it played with the flavors of the different parts of the vegetable combo. Eating with it kinda reminds me of dumpling making, where you have to use the dumpling skin to scoop out the filling while being careful not to squeeze while doing so.\n\nThe reservation system on their website is straightforward and easy to use. Additionally, they deliver to the inner and central Sunset District, the inner and central Richmond District, Cole Valley, Haigh-Ashbury, North Panhandle, and Laurel Heights. Inside, it's a bit worn, but it's clean and the setting is decorated and can flex between casual and semi-formal. Overall, I felt like it actually added to the low-key, relaxed charm. It's good for large parties of most kinds and I saw such a party while we were there. Their full bar wasn't really occupied at the time, but I'm sure it can accommodate if you're looking for a much more casual get-together.\n\nParking is...challenging along Irving Street. If you're not taking public transportation, you're gonna have to try the surrounding street parking. If you can and you're lucky, try to grab one of the spots along Irving Street. If THAT doesn't work, be sure to check the street parking on the roads running adjacent to Irving (ex. 9th, 10th, 11th, etc.). My friends and I had parked in the Andronico's Community Market parking lot (turn from Irving onto Funston Ave, it'll be to your left. Turn from Irving onto 14th Ave, it'll be on your right). It's technically only for Andronico's customers only, and we did end up buying some groceries and midnight snacks from them before leaving.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time trying something new and it was pretty delicious! That, and we were all pretty tired after a day Muir Parks and San Francisco exploring. Be aware that they're only open for dinner and are closed on Mondays. So if you're in the area during the dinner rush and don't want to deal with the long wait time you'll face with many of the Sunset District's restaurants, New Eritrea is definitely an option if you're looking for an accommodating, relaxed place for a satisfying, sit-down meal.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-05-15"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Vegetarian Combo to try as much variety as possible.

There was only one other couple at the bar at that time and so we expected quality service. But the food took a long time to prepare (30+ min) and they were unapologetic about this. \n\nWe ordered a vegetarian combo for two which included 6 dishes. My favorite was the Okra. We also ordered Kilwa (saut\u00e9ed beef), Kitffo (spicy rare beef), Zebhi Dorho (marinated chicken drumstick stew), and Kilwa Begee (lamb stew). The best, by far, was the Kitffo which was served with farmers cheese and collard greens. It was pipping hot and very flavorful. \n\nMy main disappointment was the injera. You were charged extra when ordering more and it wasn't very fresh. I am used to softer injera with a spongy texture - this injera was at least a day or two old which caused it to dry out and become become brittle. The Injera at the bottom of the plate was the worst. Normally my favorite part is to eat the injera at the end which has absorbed all the sauces and spices - But the stale injera deflated this pleasure completely.\n\nSo overall, while I love to eat Ethiopian food and really enjoyed the Kitffo, the slow service and stale injera but a damper on the experience.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-09-17"}, {"excerpts": ["A table of five ladies talking about the hot men of San Francisco ordered the following:\n\n- House Sampler-Vegetarian Combo for two: all pretty flavorful and delicious\n- Shrimp Kilwa (Shrimp sauteed with onion, tomatoes, garlic seasoned red pepper sauce and olive oil)"], "author": "Chung N.", "review": "A table of five ladies talking about the hot men of San Francisco ordered the following:\n\n- House Sampler-Vegetarian Combo for two: all pretty flavorful and delicious\n- Shrimp Kilwa (Shrimp sauteed with onion, tomatoes, garlic seasoned red pepper sauce and olive oil): We were able to select the spicy level and we chose \"medium\" and it was pretty spicy so consider yourselves warned\n- Meat combination for one: the chicken dish was delicious and, well, it's just nice to have a sampling of the different meats and spices\n- Kitffo (Beef; Tartar of finely chopped lean flank steak, mixed with seasoned clarified butter accompanied with homemade yogurt and mitmita): DELICIOUS!
