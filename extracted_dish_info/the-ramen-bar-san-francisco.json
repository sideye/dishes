Then, I see that it looks like he hired some Japanese guy to craft the meals. That sounds a bit better, but at this point I'm still skeptical. As I scan the menu, the next thing that catches me off guard are the prices. I know it's FiDi, but come on, this better be some damn good ramen to cost 12-16 dollars a bowl. I only know of 1 or 2 places with 20 dollar bowls, but they only make like 20 servings a day. Even the places in Japan, LA or SF bay area that I've been do not charge that much unless you add a ton of extras. It's ramen for crying out loud.\n\nThe Place:\nNice place, modern. I guess you would have to expect that much if Mina is involved. Free for all seating.\n\nFood:\nWhile in line, I grabbed the Yuzu Bars. These were good. You can't go wrong with some lemon bars made with yuzu instead.

Apparently for dine-in orders, you have to wait to be seated while for to-go orders, you stand in line under the \"order here\" sign. \n\nWe opted for counter seats at the window so we could be creepers and people watch. There's otherwise plenty of two-tops, several communal tables, and outdoor seating in their courtyard. There's a glass enclosed open kitchen and lots of wooden furnishings like their adjoining sister restaurant, Pabu. \n\nM E N U:\n*Ramen: Tokyo Roasted Chicken ($12), Braised Pork Belly ($12), Shrimp & Crab Dumpling ($16) and Mushroom & Tofu ($11)\n--Toppings ($2 each): Buttered corn, braised pork belly, soy cured hen egg, and extra noodles \n--Gluten-free noodles available\n--Sadly, no tonkotsu broth available because according to an Inside Scoop SF article, Chef and Mina's Partner, Ken Tominaga (Hana, Rohnert Park) doesn't like tonkotsu. Ehhh, that's like opening a taqueria and not having carnitas on the menu. \n*Donburi ($12 each): Pork, Chicken, Short Rib, and Salmon\n*Salads ($12 each): Salmon, Chicken, Beef Tataki, and Mushroom & Tofu \n\nThere's also 3 desserts on the menu ($3 each): Coffee jelly, Sake roll cake, and Pabu chocolate. \n\nBeer and Junmai are available. \n\nRamen Bar is definitely ramen made for the masses where the focus seems to be to produce as many ramen bowls as possible to feed as many FiDiers as possible. Understandably so, it's the FiDi after all. \n\nPortions are small and it doesn't seem like you're getting a full bowl of ramen (broth filled 1/3rds of the bowl, scant amount of noodles and toppings). For a filling meal, you may want to consider adding extra protein and extra noodles which will bring your total to over $20 including tax and tip. Pricey for a bowl of ramen but not very surprising given the prime real estate location. \n\nSince we just ate dinner at Pabu, we shared the Braised Pork Belly Ramen w/ extra pork belly and buttered corn ($12 + $2 + $2) which quickly came out within 4 minutes of ordering: http://bit.ly/1j2J5Kd.\n\nThe quintessential components of a solid bowl of ramen are the broth and the noodles, both of which Ramen Bar were severely lacking execution in. Opening kinks I hope. \n\nWhile I appreciate that Ramen Bar doesn't use msg in their broth, it seems like they tried to compensate by adding more soy and/or salt. The lukewarm shoyu broth was incredibly salty and one-dimensional with no depth of flavor. No umami whatsoever. I'm not trying to be a sarcastic beeeatch but I'm shocked that some reviewers found the broth to be \"light\". Maybe if I was slurping \"light soy sauce\" then yes, it's \"light\". \n\nThe spaghetti-like noodles were nicely al-dente which is great except I'm not eating at a Italian restaurant. The noodles lacked a springy, toothsome chew that good ramen noodles should have. \n\nWhile the broth and noodles left little to be desired, the chasu pork belly was very tender but you're only given two minuscule slivers for a regular order. Other ramen places usually give you two palm-sized slices. \n\nWe added \"buttered corn\" which wasn't buttered but added a sweet crisp to help make the very salty broth somewhat bearable. \n\nThe best component of the ramen bowl was the \"soy cured\" hen egg which had a perfect lava yolk consistency except it wasn't a \"soy cured\" egg as advertised on the menu. The surface didn't take on a tawny brown color and didn't have a mild, savory sweet flavor. It tasted like a plain, soft boiled egg. They should update their menu to reflect that because that's false advertising. \n\nRamen Bar offers typical condiments like togarashi and white pepper but it was a huge turn off to see the togarashi chilling at each table in an uncovered saucer. Who knows where Joe Schmo's fingers been right?\n\nFor dessert, I did enjoy their Sake Roll Cake ($3) which was light, fluffy, and delicately sweet with fresh berries; just like how Asian cakes should be: http://bit.ly/1qUWYKm.\n\nService was very upbeat, friendly, and fast so kudos for that and rounding up to 3 stars as a result. \n\nIf I still worked in the area, Ramen Underground would be my choice for a much more satisfying bowl of ramen at a fraction of the cost.

"], "author": "Jenny T.", "review": "I was a bit perplexed after finding out that Michael Mina had a restaurant opened in Japanese Ramen, as his expertise is in New American/Steakhouse fine luxurious dining.  Ramen is no where close to being in his genre and by far the complete opposite of what he's good at doing!  It got me worried that he was just jumping into the ramen craze band wagon that's been steadily growing more and more popular over this decade.  There use to be 2 ramen shops that I knew of way back in the days and they were in San Mateo (Santa Ramen and Ramen Club).  But now, there are so many more options for ramen and each has it's own distinct stamp on broth and noodles.  So, with a famous restaurateur, like M.Mina putting his designer name onto ramen, it was a must MUST try for me.\n\nAs we enter the rustic feeling Ramen Bar, it is quite spacious!  The walls are lined with neatly stacked jugs of soy sauce, hot sauce and all types of Asian ingredients.  They really wanted to make sure Japan stood out in this wooden box of noodle decor.  I liked the options of sitting at the open kitchen bar, wooden tables inside or bench seating outdoors.  Options are nice!\n\nIt was dinner time and we strolled right in and was seated immediately.  Our waiter, whom was friendly, was attentive and immediately begins educating us on the broth and how there's no popular tonkatsu broth available.  We already knew there was no tonkatsu but was ready to hear his recommendations.  Here's what our waiter recommended and we both ordered:\n\n;-)  Bottled Shochu Hai ($10) - this was a nice grapfruit juice drink.  We didn't taste any sake but it did give us a light buzz on, which is all we ask for.  Next time, we'll try to get in during happy hour for this one, as $5 is more our liking.  - 3.5 STARS\n\n;-)  Hokkadai Noodles with an extra topping of braised pork belly ($12 + $2) - First off, the noodles were really, really spectacular.  It was smooth, thin, al-dente and made great slurping noises.  Cooked to perfection and one of the best tasting ramen I've had.  The broth, which we were expecting to be a lighter version of tonkatsu was actually delightful with it's lightness.  I actually did NOT mind it was light because it still had enough fragrant to keep the flavors on my tongue happy.  The cha-sui was decent but I've had better.  The corn was immaculately freshly cut and so sweet!  Now, the waiter sold us on the braise pork belly as being the most tender fatty thing he put in his mouth, we beg to differ.  It was good but it was not the melt in your mouth pork belly that we were accustomed to.  Go to Santa Ramen and you'll understand why Ramen Bar's version was not up to par.  - 4 STARS Ramen & 2.5 STARS Braised Pork Belly\n\n;-)  Sake Roll Cake with whipped cream and berries ($3.95) - It came out in a tacky plastic container.  At least take it out and put it on a dish!  At any rate, this sponge cake was a tad stale that night but the whip cream and berries were very light and airy.  It was good but we've had better...way better, especially the sponge cake.  -- 3 STARS\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed their bowl of noodles.  I came in ready to be a hater because of a bad experience I had in Oakland's Ramen Shop (cost more, bad service, bad broth) and plus all the negative reviews I read on Yelp.  Now, to reconfirm that Ramen Bar has good ramen...go home and eat instant Top Ramen bought from a CVS store, then come back here and eat their freshly made noodles, delicious/light no-MSG broth and superior toppings, then you'll realize, damn, that's a really good bowl of Ramen.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-07-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I've tried the brittle, green tea madelines, sake roll cake, and the miso cookies.

There's always a line but it moves quick and your food comes out just as fast. First time I was here I tried the pork belly ramen. SO GOOD! The broth was very light and flavorful.. I hear they do a 24 hour \"brew\" to make it! And it wasn't salty or fatty. I also liked how it was a perfect temperature to eat right away. I like to order mine with light noodles, extra broth and extra braised oh so tender and delicious pork belly. \n\nToday I tried the roasted chicken ramen bowl. Also very good! The chicken was tender and I really enjoyed all the added greens it came with. \n\nOther points of awesomeness:\n1. You get a whole egg of perfection, vs the half egg at other places. \n2. Yummy spices to add on table\n3. MANY DESSERT OPTIONS!! I've tried the brittle, green tea madelines, sake roll cake, and the miso cookies. There's more options too!\n\nPrice is fair ($12) for being a Michael Mina restaurant. Excellent food quality and taste. Happy belly for hours :)\n\n5 stars because I haven't had a ramen fix like this in forever.

So, get in the state of mind of someone who was not raised on noodles\n\nI came here via a Yelp Elite event and partook in some items:\n\nCrispy Miso Duck Wings-I couldn't get enough if the sweet delectable treats. I don't even cook duck, but it seriously had me considering purchasing some...\n\nShrimp & crab dumpling ramen-I get it's a big bowl and such, but not being raised on noodles I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the price point. $17 for some soup!!!! Okay, now that's off my mind...it was soooooooooo darn yummy ALMOST every last drop. I would eat again (if someone else paid for it) minus the dumplings. I didn't quite like the consistency or the taste of the dumplings.\n\nSake roll cake-It was tasty, nothing really worth mentioning \nGreen tea parfait-It wasn't to my liking plus it had too many crunchy things on top\n\nAdd-on:\n-Price point very high for this\n-I didn't want to put this, but...once dumplings hit stomach/I swallowed them I wanted to throw then back up. Was it the gooey (not in a good way) consistency or something about the ingredients? I don't know\n-The desserts seemed like...what follows an afterthought? That's what they were to me...almost something they felt forced to add, but could do just, fine leaving them off the menu", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-10-02"}]}
