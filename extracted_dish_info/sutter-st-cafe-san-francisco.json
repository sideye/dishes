Saw it had good reviews so I decided to give it a try. It is easy to miss as it is inside of a parking garage. You can also access the cafe through 450 Sutter.\n\nI really enjoyed the lox bagel. It definitely satisfied my craving. Also, if you spend over a certain amount during breakfast hours you receive a complimentary hash brown and coffee. \n\nSince their lox bagel didn't disappoint, I thought to give their lunch menu a try. Their southwestern sandwich is my favorite here. It's just the right amount of spicy for me. It comes on a soft roll but I usually ask to have it on dutch crunch instead.\n\nLocation is small so it can take a while to get your food if it's really busy. I usually try to go before or after the lunch hour rush to avoid waiting.\n\nFriendly staff too!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the breakfast sandwich combo that comes with a hash brown ", "plus you get a free small coffee (good coffee too!)
