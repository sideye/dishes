My landlord, who lived on Upper Polk, had bought a condo on Page Street and when I informed her that I'd be moving out she said \"I was hoping that neighborhood would be better by now.  That was supposed to be my retirement home\".  \n\nThat was in the late 1980's, when a freeway ran right through the neighborhood and hookers solicited business beneath that freeway, at least on Page Street.  That landlord may be long gone but her dream of an improved Hayes Valley has arrived.  What a change 30 years makes.\n \nThough there's a million booze and food choices lining Hayes Street, Biergarten sits off Patricia's Green, hidden amongst the shipping containers offering coffee, juice, and ice cream.  Its popularity makes clear that it's no secret, but unless you're looking for it it'd be easy to miss.    \n\nThere's nothing here to go crazy over but the appeal of casual al fresco dining and drinking (especially in the heat of late) is attractive.  Having hit Berlin at the beginning of winter, when their biergartens had mostly moved indoors, Biergarten stood in as a worthy surrogate.  \n\nI sampled only beer, a warm pretzel, and potato salad ($6) and feel confident in reporting that Biergarten will fill your gut without raiding your savings.  It inspired my partner, with his 1/2 pint beer, to look around at the full pints and offer \"I'd like to come back here again\" (no doubt for more beer).  \n\nWith the picnic tables pretty full my 2-person party did little to skew the average patron age at Biergarten which otherwise skews young.  Still, nobody looked askance at those of us who remember this area from a time that pre-dates their birth certificate.  Despite the crowd, Biergarten proved to be good for all ages and, though I saw a dog there I notice that their web site says \"no pets\".

I am a lover of all beers and delicious bar food and Biergarten delivers on both accounts. \n\n+ ATMOSPHERE: Outdoors, very hip, tons of picnic table style seating, twinkly string lights, and food truck-ish vibes. I've been here twice so far; once after work and once right when they opened on a Sunday. After work, it was CRAZY PACKED. Like brimming with techies and hipsters. EVERYWHERE. It's hard to find a seat. The other time, we got there right when it opened at 1 PM ish so it wasn't packed but it filled up within the hour. So definitely try to plan accordingly because it'll be hard to find seating unless you're lucky. Biergarten is very casual and a great spot to hang out with friends. It's sort of like someone's backyard hang out spot. It's chill. It's cool. I dig it.\n\n+ BEER/FOOD: The beer is expensive (typical of SF of course). Choices are somewhat limited. But very good beers. There are half liter and full liter options. I think most of the liters were ~$20 and half liters ranged from ~$8-10 each. Tons of food on the menu though! So many German food options! I ordered the pretzel because I wasn't incredibly hungry. It came with some spicy mustard and horse radish. DELISH. SO SOFT. I love soft pretzels. I wanna try the other food on the menu! My friend ordered the Guest Knot and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. \n\n+ THE FINAL VERDICT: Biergarten is a great German inspired beer garden. I'm a fan of course, but mostly for the atmosphere. I love the outdoor seating and how everything's set up. It's a perfect place to chill and hang out with friends. Very casual and laid back. The food and beer is solid.

The pretzel was pretty good, but not the best German pretzel I've had. It was a thin style with mustard and horseradish, comes in seeded or non-seeded versions. The bratwurst with saurkraut was delicious of course, bursting with clear meaty juice.\n\nThere are two restrooms that are very clean and roomy. Sinks are smartly located outside. The drinking area is composed of thin picnic tables and thin benches positioned in a radial fashion around a tree. The tables are really close to each other, so you can literally be trapped in the center with the tree if you exit the wrong way. Otherwise, I love the coziness of good company and warm yellow lights on a nippy evening. This really, is a biergarten.\n\nThe huge, glaring drawback is that the line to get into the place at all gets long.

Also keep an eye out for a space opening up so you can sit down with your glorious liter of beer. When I went to order, the person working the taps was very friendly and helped me choose a beer, even offering me if I wanted to try some to make sure I would like it. \n\nWe all got a liter of Edelweiss and that was enjoyable.

When we ran out of napkins we flagged down a server and he put in more napkins in the cup where it was organized with the forks and knives. And I'm not sick from the food...\n\nAlthough it was my first time there, some pro-tips to follow by the next time I go:\n1. Dress in layers (SF weather can get really cold and windy in an instant).\n2. If you start getting cold, they lend out blankets, but get them before they lend them all out! \n3. Just get the liter. Don't skimp out on yourself.\n3. It'll probably be better to come on a \"off\" day, as in Wednesday or Thursday probably when they open up or later in the evening.
