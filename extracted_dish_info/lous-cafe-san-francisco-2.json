The taco salad comes with chicken that seemed kind of like those bagged prepared strips - I'd expect real chicken for the price. Also, thousand island dressing - I prefer it with salsa and a dollop of sour cream, but this is a cafe. Which leads me to the espresso drink I ordered - with a splash of cream. It was handed to me with the lid on - to go, no worries. I taste it - tastes funky - remove lid and see whipped cream??? Who does that? Food was mediocre - I was being lazy and didn't want to cook. Seems like sandwiches are the thing here. \n\nLessons: read the menu and ask for substitutions and don't get whipped cream in your espresso - it was disgusting. \n\nAlso, their to go packaging was all plastic - c'mon, isn't that banned now, and we should be receiving compostable containers and silverware.

There has been several attempts at a good sandwich joint in this area and none of them cut it. This place, however, is LEGIT. Boar's Head meats, fresh breads, and fine produce play the lead roles - not to mention Lou's Special Sauce and the Jalape\u00f1o Spread. I was hungry, so I ordered a bowl of chili with my sandwich. Now, the chili was delicious, but the sandwich was so HUGE, I barely got through 3 or 4 bites of it  - looks like chili for dinner tonight! I've never been to the original shop over on Geary, but if it's this good. No wonder it's a San Francisco tradition! \n\nNext trip, I'm gonna try the Cobb salad and a bowl of chowder. Oh, and they have an espresso bar and a great looking breakfast sammy menu. It appears I'll have to go back. Soon.
