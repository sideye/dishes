It was rich and creamy. I enjoyed the tempura mushrooms and the buri toro had a nice fattiness to it. The sashimi was pretty good as well. I didn't really care for the beef tataki as it was dry. The roommate seemed to enjoy his rolls.\n\nGreat sushi option for delivery.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-03-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Something that we tried once that was not craveworthy: Eryngi Tempura. \n"], "author": "Mariel A.", "review": "Haven't gotten a chance to review Daigo yet--but here goes!\n\nThe BF and I LA-LA-LOVE this place. \nWe like the rolls as well as the nigiri here. Fresh fish and great value. Service has always been great! PLUS, they deliver. AWESOMEEEE.\n\nOur go-tos:\n\nAppetizers\n--Hamachi Carpaccio and Albacore Tataki. YUMM.\n\nRolls\n--my personal FAVE Salmon Citrus Roll. The snow crab with the salmon, asparagus, and thinly sliced lemon on top...yessss. It's hard to find a roll that combines these elements together--I especially like that they don't use Krab. :]\n--Tokyo Cowboy Roll. I like the tangy tataki sauce that comes with it--it really brings everything together, with the crunchy tempura scallion, seared filet mignon, and shiitake. FLAVOR EXPLOSION.\n--Good basic rolls like tempura roll and spicy tuna roll. \n--We like getting unagi avocado hand rolls as well. \n\nSomething that we tried once that was not craveworthy: Eryngi Tempura. \nI mean truffle salt, tempura mushrooms, and a wasabi creme fraiche sauce sounds extraordinary, but honestly, it was a bit more bland than we expected. \n\nOverall, SOLID place. Haven't had to wait too long for a table, despite how small the space is. Plus, if you feel like a night in and don't want to deal with the sometimes (most times) difficult to find parking, they deliver. It's a bit pricey, but totally worth every last penny. \n\nThanks Daigo!

On this adventure, I felt like Goldilocks.  The first joint we scouted was closed. The second one had some peculiar options on the menu and looked packed.

It's unique, refreshing, and I guarantee you'll want more.  \nTuna Poke-done well and a nice option when looking for tuna.\nEryngi Tempura-the truffle oil was a little over powering, but it was good.\n\nIf you sit at the bar, you can talk to the locals and ask for recommendations.\nI ordered some abalone special, and it was decent.\n\nGood decent spot, don't forget your beer and ice cream.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-10-30"}], "sweet potato tempura": []}
