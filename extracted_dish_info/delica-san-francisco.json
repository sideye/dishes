I've eaten this in a handful of restaurants in different countries and the tentsuyu sauce was very good. It was the right amount of sweet and savory. I ate this cold, which was fine, but I'm not sure if you are supposed to heat it up first. A little pricey at $5 a piece.\n\nAssorted 9-item Sushi Bento - I loved the arrangement of this and the presentation, but I wish I got to pick what went inside my bento box. It was a pre-set amount of things. I loved most of the things in there, but my favorite was the chicken dumpling and the hijiki & soybean. The flavors were great and pretty close to a bento box from the corner store in japan. I love burdock but I wasn't a fan of the way they mixed theirs. The celery in the mix threw the flavors off.  My least favorite was the Wasabi Garlic Potato Salad. I was expecting it to taste like the sweet potato salad that's available in most Japanese grocery stores, but the wasab was overpowering. \n\nThe bento also came with 4 pieces of sushi from a roll.The bento has one piece Salmon, Tuna, 16 grain, and Shrimp & Crab. Besides the raw piece of salmon and tuna on top of the roll, everything inside the roll was cooked. The roll also had pieces of raw red peppers. It threw off the taste completely. If you had to add a veggie, they should have went with takuwan. The only roll that I finished was the 16 grain and I liked that one the most.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-05-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Some other items I love here are:\n\n*Organic Agedashi Tofu Steak: Silken "], "author": "Michelle T.", "review": "Lines here are RIDIC but worth the wait!\n\nI love Japanese style bento boxes and donburis!\n\nMy favorite here is the Ginger Beef Bowl (Natural Japanese supreme ground Kobe Beef and ginger served with shredded egg and steamed rice.

RIGHT?!?! \n\nLook, look, it's okay, you can say it, who can blame you for thinking that, after all I skew towards the Occident in my bedside reading and The Ex was a white trash wunderkind, so it's easy to picture me trolling for DL tricks at the Aryan Nation compound or something.\n\nHOWEVER, you're 100% wrong so to put it delicately fuck you. I've used ALL the crayons in the box, kids. I mean, I fucking have the Rainbow Coalition on speed dial, my ass is practically a Benetton ad, and my mouth is a branch of the Equal Rights Commission. I'M EQUAL OPPORTUNITY BITCHES! I like it all, especially my Asian brothas! \n\nOh yes. I'm not one of those gaysians who recoil at the very thought of hooking up with another gaysian -- WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THAT?!? Shit, I LOST my virginity at 15 to another Japo boy who, curiously enough, shared my first name which, now that I think about it, is a touch disturbing and probably fodder for my next therapy session and I should print this review out for my shrink, so I'll just do what I always do with traumatic incidents and pretend that never happened. \n\nI suppose I could chronicle all my sexual exploits in diversity in this review, but I'd probably be sued or something, so I'll just say that the delicious sozai food at Delica Rf-1 has been a consistently excellent performer. In fact, if I could describe to you all the wonders of Delica Rf-1, I'd have a composite of my ideal Japanese lover, who is... \n\n...SEXY.

Also, the Tonkatsu meets all expectations and the Chicken Gyoza (dumplings) are worth cheating on your spouse for.\n\n...HEALTHY. Even though I'm an avowed carnivore, I often load up on the vegetarian/vegan items here. I love the vegan crunch of the burdock and konnyaku in the Spicy Burdock Root Salad, the Potato Croquettes have always been lightly fried and crisp (at least for me), and I seriously want to eat the Hijiki and Soybean Salad off someone's crotch -- the marvelous, delicate kelp flavor is enhanced by the snap and color of the soybeans. \n\n...EXPENSIVE.  Pre-packaged bentos range from $9.50 to $11, or you can prepare a plate featuring two salads and a deli item for $9. Toss in some Roast Beef Sushi at $2 a piece or some freshly fried items (Kakiage Tempura, etc.) and you're looking at a rather expensive lunch.

It's high-end (i.e. expensive), they use fresh ingredients and even utilize some of the vendors that reside in the Ferry Building (Cowgirl Creamery and Prather Meat Company). I was lucky enough to end up here with my wife and sister in law, so we were able to get a pretty good sampling of food between the three of us. $47 later, here's how things broke down. \n\nFor all their talk about fresh, healthy and balanced meals, Delica's strength is definitely in their fried foods. The Potato Croquette was really nice, but the Crab Cream Croquette is even better. Tonkatsu was smaller and bite sized since it's made with pork tenderloin, a smaller, leaner cut of meat that benefits from being fried in panko. They're all perfectly fried, not greasy and still crispy after sitting in the display case for awhile. \n\nWe also tried both curries -- Mushroom and Ground Chicken Curry and Beef Curry served with hot steamed rice -- and they were good, but they also weren't anything special either, although the beef curry featured some perfectly cooked Prather Ranch Meat.\n\nBut the real star at Delica is the Roast Beef Sushi. A rare piece of Meyer Ranch meat on top of sushi rice and topped with baby arugula, shallots and julienned radish. It not only looked beautiful, it was absolutely delicious. And to think it was almost an afterthought because it was in a separate box from the rest of the food and we were all pretty full by the time we ate them.\n\nWe also ordered the Spinach and Sesame Salad (Goma-ae), which was very bland, but my sister in law said that that's what it's supposed to taste like. The Sweet & Spicy Chicken was good but nothing mind blowing, as was the Chicken Dumpling with sweet chili sauce. \n\nI really wanted to try the Tofu Steak with Miso Sauce and Kakiage Tempura (mixture of shredded vegetables, white shrimp in a tempura batter), but we already had too much food, but I think the next time I go, I'm just going to get three orders of roast beef sushi and call it a day.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-06-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The kakiage tempura is probably my least favorite, tempura is never good when it sits around.\n\n"], "author": "Burrito M.", "review": "Delica RF-1 is one of my staple favorite restaurants...\n\nAll of the fried food choices are fantastic.  They generally fry a batch and then serve from a plate as people order.  If you are lucky enough to get a freshly fried batch, you are in for a treat.  My faves are the tonkatsu (tonkatsu sauce is perfect, the meat is alway tender, I've never bit into any gristle or fat) and the croquette (yum!).  The kakiage tempura is probably my least favorite, tempura is never good when it sits around.\n\nThe tofu steaks are pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.  I've always looked at them in the case thinking, those look nasty!  But one day I tried the one with miso/mushroom topping and it was hella good!  Sometimes they do this agedashi style, which is just as good.\n\nThe japanese curries are decent, I like the ground beef and mushroom the best, although they are kinda chintzy on the rice.  Definitely hits the spot when it's cold and rainy.\n\nThe only thing I don't like from this joint is the okonomi yaki which I thought was sub-par.  Probably has something to do with the fact that they are pre-made and sitting there on the griddle all day until an unlucky chump orders one.\n\nRounding out their menu offerings, Delica RF-1 has a large variety of interesting salads, my faves are the green beans+sesame dressing and hijiki+soybean salads.  I like to order a bucket and eat it thru the week.\n\nNote: They will sell the fried items by the piece and the salads by weight, but you can also order combo plates and bento boxes with your choice of entree (fried item, tofu steak, etc) and various salads which you can mix and match to your heart's content, great for lunch.\n\nOne time I walked by eating a cheese sandwich from Acme, the Japanese owner told me that my sandwich was not healthy and proceeded to give me a sample of his carrot soup.

However, if you're looking for a quick line, I suggest having cash at hand to fork it over to the guy in the front of the store passing out bento boxes.\n\nThe relatively long wait during the lunch hours are worth it as the Roast Beef Sushi is excellent in presentation and taste.  Many people have the misconception that sushi has to be fish, which they would be promptly corrected.  Sushi, literally translated, just means rice vinegar--denoting that if you put it on top of rice, it's sushi. But I digress.\n\nI always enjoy getting the Number 4 combo at the Deli which includes one Hot Item, Rice and one Salad.  With a wide variety of vegetarian items, the Chinese Chicken Salad, Wasabi Garlic Potato Salad, and Spicy Burdock Root Salad are good choices.  However, I would love to try the Corn and Mascarpone Salad.\n\nAs far as the curry and fried items, the beef curry wasn't anything too special, as I could easily attain this from any other place in Japantown.  Also, the Kakiage Tempura was what seemed like a \"hot mess\" as it is filled with pretty much anything in my fridge currently, but not much can be said about things that people say are \"authentic\" to Japanese cuisine.\n\nThe food here, though, is fairly cheap, fairly tasty, and of good quality for the Ferry Building, and because of it, I continue to come back, as most other places in and around Market charge you an arm and a leg for good food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-09-14"}], "fried shrimp cake": [{"excerpts": ["We ended up getting a potato Croquette ($1.75 each, prior to tax) & a fried shrimp cake ($4 each, prior to tax).

Of all the SF Japanese restaurants, this place could best compete if they sold the same food in Japan, evident by the fact that you could find RF-1 at the basement floor of department stores in Tokyo (see downloaded pic).  It is not Japanese food from 1970's (like many J-town restaurants).  It gives you a small insight into some of the popular foods in modern Japan.  I am not saying RF-1 is the most popular type of food found in Tokyo as there are vast variety of other options available.  When transplants from Tokyo finds Delica, they are so happy to see a piece of Japan they miss.  \n\nMany people are surprised to hear this, because Delica offers food seemly Americanized.  Nope.  Americanized means taste was altered to fit the likings of American customers.  Food at Delica, along with many places in Tokyo, has been Japanized.  The taste was altered to the likings of Japanese customers - altered so much that it is now considered Japanese food.  Items in this category include: Ramen, Kasutera, Tonkatsu, Hamburg, egg sandwich, etc.\n\nWhat does this mean?  Well, you might not like their food.  Selling food that was designed to meet Japanese people's preferences to Americans is a crazy idea.  But, they opened a branch here, probably more for marketing purposes rather than for profits.  Japanese companies like to show the equity holders that they are expanding abroad, just like Beard Papa.  I don't care, because I am happy that it is here.   \n\nLike I said, 80% of the Japanese restaurants in SF wouldn't survive if they moved to Tokyo.  Just like San Francisco, restaurant industry in Tokyo is fiercely competitive, so if you are serving food that tastes like something I could cook at home (80% of SF J-Food), you are done.  All you need to know is that Delica's food is surviving the competition in Tokyo.  The food is especially popular among OLs (office ladies) (yes, the word is sexist, but I didn't invent the word).  Don't get me wrong, the traditional Japanese food like tempura and unaju is still popular in Japan, but food in Japan has done though significant transformations since 1945.  It is now quite diverse - while the passion for food has not changed.        \n\nDelica is a creation of Rock Field Co., Ltd.   The founder, Mr. Iwata Kozo, did a direct translation of his kanji characters and named the company Rock (Iwa) Field (ta).  Although the company sounds western, it is completely Japanese company.  The company has an impressive mission - to address the environment, safety, and freshness of Japanese food.  The founder had concerns about the direction of Japanese diet and is making the effort to change for the better.  Positioning Delica branch at the Ferry Building is fitting to their theme.  Where else would you find beef curry that uses Prather Ranch Meat?  Mushroom curry that uses Far West Fungi mushrooms?     \n\nSEATS:  Very limited.  Find a place outside to sit and eat under the sun.\n\nPRICE:  There is a price to the environment, safety, and freshness.  If you want cheaper food, look for MSG infused dishes at cheaper restaurants.  Expect to pay $10-14 for lunch.\n$9.50 - Bento box with five items\n$7.75 - Regular size curry\n$1.50 - Potato coroke", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-06-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I often go for the mushroom curry.

It's easily the best shrimp cake in my universe.  I'm drooling just writing about it.

A little citrusy, very flavorful, and just a salad with tofu, glass noodles (forgot what they're exactly called in English... but the clear noodles basically) and lettuce. It actually complemented the katsu really well since it offset the heaviness of it. I really dug it.

Unexpectedly great combination.\n\n- Kobe Beef Tataki\nEnjoy the tender beef with a lot of green onions and sweet sauce.\n\n- Kale Salad\nServed with slices of cheese and apple.\n\n- Grilled Squid\nTypical Japanese tapas dish.  A whole squid served with mayonnaise on the side.  Tender and chewy at the same time.  \n\n- Tsuke men\nOMG, delicious! You dip noodles in the broth with a lot of mushroom.\nOne of the popular ways to have ramen noodles in Japan.\n\n- Baked Curry\nCaution: very very very hot!!  Ouch!  It is good, but don't rush!

Of all the SF Japanese restaurants, this place could best compete if they sold the same food in Japan, evident by the fact that you could find RF-1 at the basement floor of department stores in Tokyo (see downloaded pic).  It is not Japanese food from 1970's (like many J-town restaurants).  It gives you a small insight into some of the popular foods in modern Japan.  I am not saying RF-1 is the most popular type of food found in Tokyo as there are vast variety of other options available.  When transplants from Tokyo finds Delica, they are so happy to see a piece of Japan they miss.  \n\nMany people are surprised to hear this, because Delica offers food seemly Americanized.  Nope.  Americanized means taste was altered to fit the likings of American customers.  Food at Delica, along with many places in Tokyo, has been Japanized.  The taste was altered to the likings of Japanese customers - altered so much that it is now considered Japanese food.  Items in this category include: Ramen, Kasutera, Tonkatsu, Hamburg, egg sandwich, etc.\n\nWhat does this mean?  Well, you might not like their food.  Selling food that was designed to meet Japanese people's preferences to Americans is a crazy idea.  But, they opened a branch here, probably more for marketing purposes rather than for profits.  Japanese companies like to show the equity holders that they are expanding abroad, just like Beard Papa.  I don't care, because I am happy that it is here.   \n\nLike I said, 80% of the Japanese restaurants in SF wouldn't survive if they moved to Tokyo.  Just like San Francisco, restaurant industry in Tokyo is fiercely competitive, so if you are serving food that tastes like something I could cook at home (80% of SF J-Food), you are done.  All you need to know is that Delica's food is surviving the competition in Tokyo.  The food is especially popular among OLs (office ladies) (yes, the word is sexist, but I didn't invent the word).  Don't get me wrong, the traditional Japanese food like tempura and unaju is still popular in Japan, but food in Japan has done though significant transformations since 1945.  It is now quite diverse - while the passion for food has not changed.        \n\nDelica is a creation of Rock Field Co., Ltd.   The founder, Mr. Iwata Kozo, did a direct translation of his kanji characters and named the company Rock (Iwa) Field (ta).  Although the company sounds western, it is completely Japanese company.  The company has an impressive mission - to address the environment, safety, and freshness of Japanese food.  The founder had concerns about the direction of Japanese diet and is making the effort to change for the better.  Positioning Delica branch at the Ferry Building is fitting to their theme.  Where else would you find beef curry that uses Prather Ranch Meat?  Mushroom curry that uses Far West Fungi mushrooms?     \n\nSEATS:  Very limited.  Find a place outside to sit and eat under the sun.\n\nPRICE:  There is a price to the environment, safety, and freshness.  If you want cheaper food, look for MSG infused dishes at cheaper restaurants.

You find a seat or take it on the go.  The food is beautifully prepared, and the spectacular flavors will surprise you.\n\nEverything I've tried to date has been delicious whether it be the Organic Mabo Tofu Salad, the signature Roast Beef Sushi or the Wild Salmon and Sesame Genmai Rice Ball.\n\nThe Shrimp Curry is probably my favorite selection here.  Depending on my appetite I usually go for the regular serving, but I have stuffed myself with the large portion on occasion.  In a mild brown curry sauce expect to find lots of firm baby shrimp, chunks of soft zucchini and tomato pieces nearly melted away.  They use seasonal vegetables in their curry dishes so you may not get the same zucchini and tomato combination that they've been serving up lately.  The curry is served with a generous portion of hot steamed rice to the side allowing you to eat each part separately or all mixed together.\n\nThe Potato and White Corn Croquette is outstanding.  It reminds me of the deep-fried taro root pastries found at many Chinese dim sum houses, but it is far less oily.  These are deep-fried also.  It's a smooth, creamy potato center with a delicate crispy, crumbly shell on the outside.  Bite into the croquette and you will discover soft, creamy kernels of white corn inside.  \n\nMost of the prepared food is on display inside the crystal clear deli cases and each looks like a different work of art.

It is probably the largest tempura fried item I have ever seen.  I mean it's definitely not something you hold in your hand or eat in one bite.  You have to break it apart and for some reason, the shredded vegetables binds it so firmly together that it becomes quite difficult to separate.  I do like that big pieces of white shrimp are incorporated into it.  Unfortunately, all these aren't fried on the spot so they've been sitting in the glass counter and is missing the aspect that I like most about tempura and fried foods in general, the fresh friedness.\n\nAs for the Hijiki Soybean Salad and the Mascarpone Corn Salad, I definitely preferred the latter since I'm a die hard corn fan.

What really stood out was the sweetness of the Tonkatsu sauce. It had just a hint of sourness and really made the sandwich as delicious as I hoped.\n\nThe Mabo salad was a very pleasant surprise.

My faves are the tonkatsu (tonkatsu sauce is perfect, the meat is alway tender, I've never bit into any gristle or fat) and the croquette (yum!).  The kakiage tempura is probably my least favorite, tempura is never good when it sits around.\n\nThe tofu steaks are pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.  I've always looked at them in the case thinking, those look nasty!  But one day I tried the one with miso/mushroom topping and it was hella good!

SO crazy good was the eggplant curry with GROUND CHICKEN ($7.75), I felt like I was rising out of my chair.  And, you can certainly make a meal out of their little fried goodies.  At 2.75-3.75 a piece it seems dear until you get that first bite of panko goodness.  Add in 1/2 pinto of edamame or green bean salad with miso dressing and a pro bono view of the bay and you're stylin'.\n\n\nPeople!  It's all about the PANKO!  (those yum-licious breadcrumbs that fry ever so delicately to encase delica's fried specialties: potato and mushroom croquettes, shrimp cake, tonkatsu, et al).  \n\nThe panko-fried items get 5 stars, but the unfortunate (fast japanese food hazard) BLANDNESS of some items like sweet-n-sour chicken (chunks of orangey chicken, had it today), hijiki and soybean salad (not sea-salty enough-- this is seaweed, isn't it??) and glazed chicken meatballs (apparently, the glaze is COSMETIC) brings this super-sanitary and well-run by happy-shiny-counterpeople upscale deli down to 4 stars.  \n\nHowever, 4 stars is by no means bad in my book-- MAKING it worth the jacked-up ferry plaza prices ($9.50 for bento, approx $3.75 for panko-fried items).  \n\nNotable items (aside from the amazing FRIED MENU) include:  Chinese Chicken Salad, made with the delica touch:  julienne veggies and chicken, the best use of baby celery I've ever tasted and DEAD-ON chinese chicken salad vinaigrette without all of the fuss of an americanized chinese chix salad.  \n\nAlso, wasabi, garlic and edamame potato salad:  who the hell thought of this?  It's crazy good.  Half-mashed wasabi-garlic potatoes, whole fresh edamame beans in a cold potato salad-- great intimate picnic food.  \n\nAnd, another one of my personal favs, the roast beef nigiri, just like it sounds, thinly sliced rare roast beef atop a finger of japanese sushi rice (the rice it pretty decent, not gross or cheap or sticky), maybe some scallion garnish.  \n\nThey also have other sushi, some wrapped in rice paper rather than seaweed, that I have yet to try...\n\nThose bento boxes (various items, always a healthy, square meal) sure are handy for buying to-go and finding a people watching or bayview perch in the back of the ferry plaza or the nearby Embarcadero.  \n\nAlso, Japanese style cooking and dining is engineered to be 'systematically beautiful' and therefore a non-messy, organized and tranquililty-inducing eating experience (think Zen...) which explains why some items lack the flavor kick. (Gloppy, sloppy sweet and sour sauce? No way, sensai!).  \n\nThis Japanese tradition of food presentaion carried out at Delica also explains the CALM I feel even when I'm CHOWING on one of their panko-fried mushroom croquettes and dipping them in the delicate tomato or herbed mayo sauces-- with chopsticks!\n\nCan't beat the bayview location, friendly staff (and very cute asian guys).

However, if you're looking for a quick line, I suggest having cash at hand to fork it over to the guy in the front of the store passing out bento boxes.\n\nThe relatively long wait during the lunch hours are worth it as the Roast Beef Sushi is excellent in presentation and taste.

Sushi, literally translated, just means rice vinegar--denoting that if you put it on top of rice, it's sushi. But I digress.\n\nI always enjoy getting the Number 4 combo at the Deli which includes one Hot Item, Rice and one Salad.  With a wide variety of vegetarian items, the Chinese Chicken Salad, Wasabi Garlic Potato Salad, and Spicy Burdock Root Salad are good choices.  However, I would love to try the Corn and Mascarpone Salad.\n\nAs far as the curry and fried items, the beef curry wasn't anything too special, as I could easily attain this from any other place in Japantown.  Also, the Kakiage Tempura was what seemed like a \"hot mess\" as it is filled with pretty much anything in my fridge currently, but not much can be said about things that people say are \"authentic\" to Japanese cuisine.\n\nThe food here, though, is fairly cheap, fairly tasty, and of good quality for the Ferry Building, and because of it, I continue to come back, as most other places in and around Market charge you an arm and a leg for good food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-09-14"}, {"excerpts": ["At Delica rf-1, I ordered a bento box and asked the man behind the counter to surprise me.

Maybe not the most annoying ever, but I'll be pushing it.  I can't help it.  Here is the usual caveat:  My family is from Japan so I am compelled to measure Japanese places, however it is spun (I dunno, is fusionified a word?), with my extremely fine-tuned and calibrated meterstick.  Oh no no, I don't even use a yardstick to measure Japanese food.  It's gotta be metric.  \n\nBut I must include an additional caveat that I studied postmodern critical theory.  So, really, instead of reading this review, I think you ought to read Roland Barthes's \"Empire of Signs\"--his excellent mini-book about his trip to Japan--especially the chapter on Japanese food.  He can talk about signs and signifier/signified mumbo jumbo better than I, in a poetic, poignant writing style to boot.  This place really makes me think of all that crap I had to read and spew out in 20 page term papers.\n\nDelica bills itself as a sohzai/okazu-ya, a prepared food deli selling hot and cold Japanese dishes.  There are about 4-5 salad selections (my faves:  hijiki salad and green bean/sesame salad) and 4-5 fried food selections you can get individually or in a multi-item bento box.  Also, they have items like curry and soba that don't quite fall in the \"sohzai\" category.  The cold dishes are healthy and are pretty much vegetarian.  The hot dishes are fried and meaty (I haven't tried the potato croquet, but traditionally those have ground meat in them so if you're veg, ask first.).  I think the food is pretty tasty, but definitely not make-a-special-trip-to-Ferry-Building or call-my-Mom-and-tell-her-I-found-a-replacement-cook good.  I also have a beef (and not delicious rare beef sushi) with the fact that they count rice as an \"item\" in the bento.  Apparently, one of Delica's twists on Japanese is not getting the math right.  That's like a BBQ joint saying a three-way is chicken, ribs, and bread.  Or Panda Express telling you that a two-item plate is orange chicken and rice.  In Japan, rice ain't an \"item.\"  It's a blank, if you will, to cleanse palates, catch dripping sauces, and dilute strongly flavored foods.\n\nI think what makes me feel really \"whatever\" about this place is that it's wishy washy in whether it wants to be a haute fusion fast food joint or to be as true-to-form sohzai-ya as one can be in the Ferry Building.  I would embrace either extreme in its fully fledged form, but for now, I wonder why a kakiage (bits-n-pieces tempura) is cylindrical instead of flat and round.  Or why they put daizu (mature soy beans) AND edamame (young soy beans) in the hijiki salad.  Meaning, the twist they put on the original version doesn't elicit an \"aha!\" reaction, in that it's not functional to the actual flavor.  If they're gonna be half-assed about coming up with their own version of Japanese classics, why not go authentic and show everyone a new facet of the cuisine that's not sushi or ramen or teppan-yaki?\n\nSo yes, it's annoying that I am not really critiquing the food or the service, but the concept of the restaurant.

A little pricey at $5 a piece.\n\nAssorted 9-item Sushi Bento - I loved the arrangement of this and the presentation, but I wish I got to pick what went inside my bento box. It was a pre-set amount of things. I loved most of the things in there, but my favorite was the chicken dumpling and the hijiki & soybean. The flavors were great and pretty close to a bento box from the corner store in japan. I love burdock but I wasn't a fan of the way they mixed theirs. The celery in the mix threw the flavors off.  My least favorite was the Wasabi Garlic Potato Salad. I was expecting it to taste like the sweet potato salad that's available in most Japanese grocery stores, but the wasab was overpowering. \n\nThe bento also came with 4 pieces of sushi from a roll.The bento has one piece Salmon, Tuna, 16 grain, and Shrimp & Crab. Besides the raw piece of salmon and tuna on top of the roll, everything inside the roll was cooked. The roll also had pieces of raw red peppers. It threw off the taste completely. If you had to add a veggie, they should have went with takuwan. The only roll that I finished was the 16 grain and I liked that one the most.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-05-03"}, {"excerpts": ["I typically get the 4 item bento box:\n\nWasabi Garlic Potato Salad "], "author": "Tanya C.", "review": "Delica is a Japanese deli located in the Ferry Building.

Put with the tofu, it became very refreshing and light. I was wary at first to try the potato salad since it had wasabi, but boy was I glad to have given it a try! There was only the slightest bit of wasabi flavor! The potato salad was drowned with mayo like other restaurants mistakenly do, instead it was lightly coated. The curry was pretty average. It was perfectly cooked not. too thick and not too watery, which is another rare find. The sushi was quite interesting in that instead of a seaweed wrapper they used soy wraps. There was barely any rice, but more lettuce. You could almost say it's what happens when Japanese sushi meets Vietnamese spring rolls. The sashimi that was placed on top wasn't very fresh, but otherwise the sushi was what you'd expect if it's been refrigerated and made into a take-out item.\n\nThe main reason why I love Delica is because their food is always light and you don't feel the slightest bit sluggish after eating their food.  The only minor problem with eating here and anywhere else in the Ferry building for that matter is because there's a lot of people/tourists making it  always hard to find places to sit.

Out of their main dishes, the tofu steak with chicken is surprisingly hearty and the fried shrimp cake is simply mind-blowing.

It's high-end (i.e. expensive), they use fresh ingredients and even utilize some of the vendors that reside in the Ferry Building (Cowgirl Creamery and Prather Meat Company). I was lucky enough to end up here with my wife and sister in law, so we were able to get a pretty good sampling of food between the three of us. $47 later, here's how things broke down. \n\nFor all their talk about fresh, healthy and balanced meals, Delica's strength is definitely in their fried foods. The Potato Croquette was really nice, but the Crab Cream Croquette is even better. Tonkatsu was smaller and bite sized since it's made with pork tenderloin, a smaller, leaner cut of meat that benefits from being fried in panko. They're all perfectly fried, not greasy and still crispy after sitting in the display case for awhile. \n\nWe also tried both curries -- Mushroom and Ground Chicken Curry and Beef Curry served with hot steamed rice -- and they were good, but they also weren't anything special either, although the beef curry featured some perfectly cooked Prather Ranch Meat.\n\nBut the real star at Delica is the Roast Beef Sushi. A rare piece of Meyer Ranch meat on top of sushi rice and topped with baby arugula, shallots and julienned radish. It not only looked beautiful, it was absolutely delicious. And to think it was almost an afterthought because it was in a separate box from the rest of the food and we were all pretty full by the time we ate them.\n\nWe also ordered the Spinach and Sesame Salad (Goma-ae), which was very bland, but my sister in law said that that's what it's supposed to taste like. The Sweet & Spicy Chicken was good but nothing mind blowing, as was the Chicken Dumpling with sweet chili sauce. \n\nI really wanted to try the Tofu Steak with Miso Sauce and Kakiage Tempura (mixture of shredded vegetables, white shrimp in a tempura batter), but we already had too much food, but I think the next time I go, I'm just going to get three orders of roast beef sushi and call it a day.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-06-10"}], "crystal geyser water": [], "crystal geyser sparkling water": [], "lb hijiki and soybean salad lunch": [], "lb spicy burdock root salad lunch": [], "lb spinach and sesame salad lunch": [], "lb wasabi garlic potato salad lunch": [], "lb green bean salad lunch": [], "lb eggplant salad lunch": [], "lb karaage caesar salad": [], "lb tsukemono salad": [], "organic tofu miso soup lunch": [], "mamestrone soup": [], "salmon chowder lunch": [], "agedashi tofu steak lunch": [], "tofu and chicken patty with hijiki lunch": [], "kakiage tempura lunch": [], "fried shrimp cake lunch": [], "potato croquette lunch": [], "crab croquette lunch": [], "pork cutlet": [{"excerpts": ["I would also recommend pork cutlet and the wasabi potato salad.
