Personally, I still prefer mine without the sauce but if you do, there is a garlicky alternative to the standard red hot sauce. A new discovery though - the green onion salad. Totally works as it's a bright salad that goes well with the crispy fried chicken and definitely more flavorful than the standard shredded cabbage slaw. \n\nBut in my numerous return visits, I've samples SO much more and Cocobang does a good job at more than just the fried chicken. Let's explore some of my new favorites here: \n\nCorn cheese - It's exactly like it sounds. Sweet corn and melted cheese in a hot skillet. So addictively and gluttonously satisfying.  \n\nBraised pork feet - Would not typically order the dish but saw a lady next to us enjoying a whole plate of it so I knew I had to get an order of these tender trotters. The meat is flavorful and pairs well with the kimchee.\n\nBoiled pork with spicy daikon - if based on description alone, this dish does not seem appetitizing but it's deceptively good. The pork just works with the spicy pickled daikon, raw garlic, and kimchee. \n\nPan fried clear noodles - I guess this is jap chae and I'm pre-disposed to like it. Cocobang does a decent one. \n\nSteamed Korean sausage - This took a while to get used to texturally. It's not as odd as coagulated blood but there is definitely some element of it. Not for everyone but worth trying if you're curious. \n\nOf course all the other usual favorites like bibimbap and spicy tofu stews are on the menu.

The pork cutlet with special sauce was sweet, sweeter than the fried chicken. I would get the fried chicken again to share. I really liked the salad that was paired for both of those dishes I just mentioned before: half of the plate was of salad: really good portions. The beef short rib was really good.

Daebak!! \n\nCocobang's kitchen is a one-woman show. This cute ahjummonie is badass. Regardless of how packed they are with drunken patrons, the food still comes out fast and hot. \nI've been here 3 times so far, and have never waited longer than 10-15 mins each time. \nOr maybe I just didn't notice the wait because there's always cute korean kpop-like waiters running around, lol..\n\nBanchan flavors are spot on and plentiful. The kimchi has just the right amount of sourness and spice to it. http://bit.ly/1LhqTTO\n\nI can't tell you anything about their mixed soju drinks ($12.95), since we only drink Chamisul Soju ($10.95) straight out the bottle. None of that frufru shet.\n\nThe full menu is extensive. They even have dried file fish and cuttlefish as anju (Korean equivalent to the all-American beer nuts).\n\nWarning: Pics may be a bit blurry due to excessive soju drinking. Chee hoo! \n\nFRIED CHICKEN ($9 for 1/1; $15-$17 for whole bird):\n1) Regular/KFC: Thin crust with a distinctive crunch thanks to a coating of corn starch. This was our favorite.\n2) Hot & Tangy/Yangnyeom: Tossed in a sweet vinegary spicy gochujang sauce.\n3) Garlic Sweet Sauce\n4) Green Onion/Padak: Glazed in a sweet soy mustard sauce and covered in a mound of spring onions. \n\nWe got the combination of the regular fried chicken and the spicy yangnyeom one. \nhttp://bit.ly/1STa4Fh\nThe regular KFC was a clear winner of the two. The sauced up chicken was too soggy and the sauce itself just tasted overly sweet.\n\nGALBI ($15.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1MQQjc2\nThe marinated beef short ribs were tender and flavorful. \n- Price was a bit stiff for just just 2 pieces (which they cut up to make 6 pieces).\n\nKimchi Fried Rice ($10.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1PK3ErR\nI wasn't a fan of this, as it was too sweet for my taste.

The slices of hot dog in it was also flavorless and overpowered by the sauce. \n\nFRIED MANDOO ($7.95 for 6 pc):  \nhttp://bit.ly/1MwKxgD\nThere's a good amount of pork in their small mandoo, with just the right amount of glass noodles and tofu. Clean flavors and tasty. But hella pricey for $8....\n\nKIMCHI JEON ($11.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1H45eDU\nThis pancake was thick and filling. Was a bit worried when it arrived looking like thick pita bread, but surprisingly it tasted pretty good. You get a mouthful of ripe kimchi in every bite.\n\nCHICKEN CUTLET ($12.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1ONdniK\nI wasn't impressed with their version of chicken katsu. It was thin and a bit dry. Their sweet \"special sauce\" tasted like it was ketchup-based. \n\nSPICY TOFU SOUP ($10.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1MQQuEo\nChoice of protein- Seafood, beef, pork, kimchi or vegetable.\nChoice of level of spiciness- Mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy.\n- This bubbling earthenware of goodness hits the spot after a long night of partying. \nThe broth could use more depth in flavor, perhaps more kelp and dried anchovies when boiling the broth? But the silken tofu just melts in your mouth. My tummy (and poor liver) were quite happy.\n\nSPICY PORK ($12.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1QGi6C3\nIt's a nice change to find thinly sliced pork butt/shoulder being used instead of the thicker pork belly. What you end up with is just tender bites of lean porky goodness.\n\nBEEF BULGOGI ($14.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1Nz6w6q\nGrilled marinated sliced beef. Simple, delicious and goes well with just a hot bowl of rice. \n- You can combine any 2 sizzling bbq for $16.95.

It's something I've always suspected but never wanted to admit: I don't think I like Korean food. \n\nBut I swear I'm not racist. One of my friends is Korean!\n\nAnyway. \n\nI came here last night after an evening of free drinks at a mixer in Nob Hill. After hob-nobbing with my roomie and some new friends, we headed down the hill for ramen. Upon seeing the wait at Katana-Ya, we walked around a few blocks until someone recognized Cocobang. Due to our starving bellies and low attention spans, we headed inside and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. \n\nThroughout the course of our meal, we thought we were going to have either 4, 5 or 7 people at the table. As we let our server know of each of our changes, they were extremely accommodating with different set up combinations of tables and chairs. I would have been annoyed by us, but luckily our waiter was not me. Also good since I wouldn't have understood what we ordered and served us fried chicken and hashbrowns.\n\nWe went family-style and ordered a plethora of dishes: the hot pot tofu, spicy chicken with cheese (temporarily thought I was at Chevy's), an assorted seafood pancake, kim chi fried rice and a bowl with many things I didn't recognize.

The chicken was the highlight (I sound so white-washed saying this... of course I liked the spicy chicken the most) but I really enjoyed the pancake too. \n\nWould I come back here? Probably not. But that has nothing to do with Cocobang. The food came out really fast, the servers were patient will all our seating and food changing requests, my friends who like Korean food really enjoyed themselves, and it's a cute, cozy place for a cold Friday night.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-05"}], "boiled pork with spicy daikon": [{"excerpts": ["(Soon Du Bu Jjigae), and the Boiled pork with Spicy Daikon, and a peach soju.

We got here around 9pm, and as expected the place was packed. The place itself is a bit of a hole in the wall, with K-pop playing in the background. After getting in and putting our name in, it was a 30 minute wait. However, it was well worth the wait. Also since we were starving, we actually put in our order before we sat, so that as soon as we were seated the food and drinks came out. \n\nWe got the corn cheese, regular fried chicken, Pork Spicy Tofu Soup (Soon Du Bu Jjigae), and the Boiled pork with Spicy Daikon, and a peach soju. The corn cheese, is basically what it sounds like, corn and cheese on a hot skillet, was a nice appetizer. The fried chicken was juicy, but a little bland. The tofu soup was delicious however, and the real star was the boiled pork. Taking the daikon, you basically construct a little wrap in what ends up being mouthfuls of flavor. Overall, the food and soju were very satisfying, and had a great value.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Boiled pork with spicy daikon - if based on description alone, this dish does not seem appetitizing ", "but it's deceptively good.

Not really my favorite Korean dish as it normally has a bunch of other ingredients that makes the soup thick, but Coco bang's rendition was lighter which was nice.\n\n*Spicy tofu soup: seafood, spicy ($10.95)\nNot spicy enough for me and could have used a little more seafood, but had good flavor. Very comforting.\n\n*Beef short rib bbq ($15.95)\nI was surprised by how inexpensive this was as I normally pay $20+ for kalbi. Tasty, but I've had better kalbi elsewhere. Still a solid dish.\n\n*Braised pork feet ($14.95)\nI love jok bal.This was probably my favorite dish of the night!\n\nWe also got a 1.6 liter of OB ($12.95).

After going around a couple times, we found parking less than 2 blocks away.  \n\nThe place is small and dark with music video playing - almost feel like a lounge but not quite, I actually wish it was.  Anyway, we sat at one of the smaller table for 2 (if you plan to order 3 dishes, be aware you will be space challenged) and started checking out the menu.  Many dishes sounded good and we didn't know what some items were.  After much debate, we decided on:\n\nfried chicken wings w/ sweet & spicy sauce - $7.95 - really good fried chicken wings, would be good w/o any sauce.  not oil, very crispy and not a lot of batter.  I like the sauce too and it came with a heaping side of slaw (thinly slice cabbage w/ like a Thousand Island dressing).   \n\nhomemade thick noodle soup - $10.95 - this was ok, we didn't know what to expect but wanted the homemade noodle.  the noodle itself was good but the whole thing wasn't very tasty.  i had asked for it to be spicy and i think he forgot.  the broth was a little thick and cream color - some sliced squash, carrots and potato and about 10 small white clams.  I think the potato may have been the thickening agent for the broth?  \n\npan fried chicken gizzard - $10.95 - delicious!  it was served on a sizzling platter, all gizzards with slices of onion, green onion and many many whole cloves of garlic that were simply melts in the mouth.  I know because I had quite a few and the garlic breath this morning was no joke!  If you love gizzard, this is a must - a perfect dish to munch with ice cold beer while enjoying the music videos.\n\n2 draft - $2.50each - domestic but not sure what it was.  $3 for imported.\n\nOverall, I love the ambience and really enjoyed the music videos.  It is a good mix of American and many Korean with mostly dance like music that was played pretty loud, which I didn't mind a bit!  \n\nWhen my crazy sister visits next time, I'll be sure to bring her here because I know she'll love the place!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-01-09"}], "pan fried kimchi and pork with tofu": []}
