We order pizza, Chinese food or Indian, but very rarely are there burrito delivery services. I guess Grub Hub's advertisement depicting two bros high-fiving and exclaming, \"I just ordered a burrito for delivery!\" really got to me.\n\nRegardless, I placed my order for 2 on Grub Hub. The delivery was pretty standard and they met the estimated delivery time with no problem. However, after the driver had left, I realized that they did not give me the chips and guacamole that I ordered. In fact, I received zero tortilla chips, even though I had ordered a side of salsa. (I think any upstanding taqueria should give you chips with your order, but that's besides the point.)\n\nI circumvented the Grub Hub website and contacted the restaurant directly. I was told the driver was going to be contacted with my first call. 20 minutes pass. I call again. It will be another 20 minutes. 40 minutes pass. I call again and I am told that they are \"very busy\" to which I reply that it is unacceptable to not have my paid-for item either reimbursed or delivered. I was given an, \"Okay,\" and hung up on.\n\nMeanwhile, I had already finished eating my sub-standard quesadilla and in all honesty, was arguing for the sake of retribution-- I didn't really want their poor quality guac.\n\nThankfully, Grub Hub took it upon themselves to reverse the charge and give me free credit for a future order.

If you like wet burritos and chorizo id say give this place a shot. \n\nThe chorizo is cooked fresh, and then pre-paired with all the fixings including a choice of tortilla, i get the spinach tortilla, beans, rice inside then smothered in sauce. Its topped with sour cream, guacamole  and cheese. The sauce they use has a little tang to it, a smooth mild flavor. It pairs nice with their hot sauce on top, which is also included. The chorizo is spiced nicely, but not over the top. It isnt to greasy like chorizo can be. The overall flavor is good of this creation; seasoned nicely, a good tang from the lime, salted correctly, and the right amount of food. I suspect the wet sauce is what adds the richness of flavor and depth of character. Would it not be for the wet sauce it probably wouldnt be as good, it just brings it all together.\n\nThis is a classic mexican joint that has the meet pre-cooked (other than the chorizo wich is cooked to order) and why i never order anything other than the chorizo. Of course things like marinated pork in green sauce and what-have-you need to be pre made, i get that, but because of this i find its better to order things that are cooked fresh and not from the hot warmers. This is a general statement about all mexican joints with warmers. \n\nI have noticed if you dont watch them make the food, they have a tendency to get things wrong, like giving me a regular tortilla instead of a spinach one. So make sure your clear, patient, and pay attention when they start your order. \n\nI can see how people may think they are rude, but lets be honest, if you are rude first why would you expect them to be super nice. Gotta put out what you want to recive back.\n\nAll and all, its a decent spot for a wet burrito with chorizo.
