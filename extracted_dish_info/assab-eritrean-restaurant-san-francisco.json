Since I go out every week with my friend to sample different cuisines, and since I am heading back to the East Coast for the holidays, I figured, \"Hey, why not do Eritrean before I leave SF for vacation?\"\n\nWe were deciding between Assab and Bamboo Village. Eritrean vs. Indonesian; my friend was craving Indonesian food more since he was under the impression that \"Ethiopian food is too healthy-sounding for me tonight.\" But, we decided we would make our final decision if we got the chance to look at both menus. Assab didn't have a menu outside, so my friend wanted us to walk down to Bamboo Village (just a block away) to check them out first. Ah, but upon approaching Bamboo Village...the place was packed. It looked like there was a big party dinner, so the whole restaurant was full (the place wasn't so big anyway). So, by default, we went back to Assab (I really wanted Assab in the first place, so this was my victory).\n\nAssab wasn't so busy at around 7pm; we sat by the window (bad idea on a cold night in SF!); we ordered the Vegetable Sambusa (fritter), the Meat Combo and the Vegetable Combo. It was my friend's first time to try Eritrean food, so he certainly was not aware that there were no silverware involved. When the main course came out (on a HUGE platter), my friend panicked a little at the thought of using his hands to grab the food. \"It's not...sanitary?\" he said. Meanwhile, I was fine with the idea and was already tearing away at the injera and dipping it into the food.\n\nAt first, my friend was eating the injera and meat/veg reluctantly with his hands. Then, he summoned our server and this conversation ensued:\n\nFriend: \"May I...have a spoon?\"\nServer smiles, shakes head \"NO\" and makes my friend gasp in astonishment. I knew he already felt embarrassed.\nServer: \"We don't have any spoons here, but I can go downtown and buy one for you if you want.\"\nFriend: \"Uh...uh...no, that's okay.\"\nServer: \"Are you sure?\"\nFriend: \"Yes...yes, I'm sorry, I didn't know.\"\n\nSo my friend really believed that there were no spoons available, and settled for using his hands. He said he was \"getting used to the idea\" when the server came back and actually handed him a spoon. Then, my friend used the spoon the rest of the time we were eating.\n\nAnyway, that was a fun/funny experience in itself. But onto the actual review--\n\nFood: Great; I loved the spices/seasonings. I'm not quite educated in Eritrean food just yet, but I liked what I ate at Assab. The meat and veggie combos are great for those who aren't familiar with the different dishes yet.\n\nPrices: Average for dinnertime; of course not as cheap as Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese places, but I'm under the impression that the prices at Eritrean places are a little more expensive ($10-$15) due to the experience and to the exotic nature of the food (please pardon me if I am wrong).\n\nService: The server and the cook were both very nice. Food arrived relatively quickly, and the server made sure to check up on us from time to time. Also, I liked his sense of humor.\n\nAtmosphere: Not as dreamy/intimate as New Eritrea in the Sunset, but still a nice place for dinner. Seemed to accomodate groups okay; the place itself is smaller than New Eritrea though. \n\nLocation: Extra props for being super accessible from the Geary bus stops.\n\nOverall, I really like Assab, and hope to be back in the New Year.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-12-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Here's what we ordered: \n\nVegetable Sambusa -- came out steaming and were crispy \nMeat Sambusa -- was tastier than "], "author": "Thang H.", "review": "I came here on a Monday night with two other people.

"], "author": "Steph P.", "review": "When I told my mother that I was taking my brother to eat Eritrean/Ethiopian food, she said with a laugh, \"What do you eat at Ethiopian? Dinosaur?\" Aghast at my mom's ignorance but also bemused at her strange sense of humor (maybe that's where I get it from?), I tried to explain the wonders of this complex, yet humble cuisine. There is something very primally satisfying about eating with your hands, with the injera serving more as a sponge for all the delightfully seasoned sauces than as a utensil. Ordinary meats like beef, chicken, and lamb are taken to a level most Western or Eastern palates have not experienced. At least, that's what *good* Eritrean/Ethiopean food is like...and Assab most definitely delivers with a delectable dining endeavor.\n\nOn this trip, we ordered:\n\n- Vegetable Sambusa: started out with this nicely sized fried envelope stuffed with green peas, carrots and spices. It was a little messy to eat, and I was surprised that it wasn't served with some kind of sauce. Not bad for $2.\n\n- Shiro: pureed chick peas, whose consistency conjured up thoughts of something between baby food and whipped mashed potatoes. I'm on the fence whether that's a good or bad thing. The flavor fares more positively, well seasoned and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and pepper.\n\n- Meat combination: which included small portions of the:\n#3 Zigni: small pieces of beef cooked with onions, tomato, butter, and an added kick of hot pepper. This was quite good, though the beef was a little chewier than I would have liked and the butter flavor was not as strong as at New Eritrea.\n\n#4. Tsebhi - Derho: we got one chicken leg on the bone (though you can also get thighs), cooked in a sauce similar to the Zigni. I really wish that there was more meat to this...will definitely have to try it as a full entree and not as part of the meat combo next time.\n\n# 8. Alicha-beggee: cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots and bell peppers. The flavor was strong, without being overpoweringly \"lamby.\" I believe Michael Bauer has used that exact term.\n\n- Vegetable combination: a sampling of three standby Ethiopean vegetable dishes:\n#13. Veg alicha: Potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cabbage are subtly seasoned and melt in your mouth. Toss up between this and New Eritrea.\n\n#14. Okra: delicious stew of okra that does a good job of riding the line of texture for okra; not too firm, and not too slimy.\n\n#15. Zucchini: probably the weakest link, similar in seasoning to the okra. I am not a huge zuchini fan, so meh.\n\nThe injera that Assab uses is very good, though I do think that New Eritrea wins in this category. Assab's injera seems to be structurally a bit too thin. If you look at the structure of the surface of the injera, you'll see that it is very \"holey.\" I think that this is why the injera falls apart so easily while handling the food.  The taste is also a bit on the mild side for me and could have used a bit more tang. Another bummer is that they only give you one piece of injera per person; New Eritrea gives you two. An extra only costs $0.75, so it's not a huge deal but something to note. Assab also has super cheap drinks - a bottle of honey wine is $19, by the glass is $5. Imported beers are no more than $3.75, and fruit juices are good as well. As far as the service, I think that our waitress secretly hated us because we took forever to decide. We also thought it was strange that they didn't give us small plates when we ordered our appetizer.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the seasoning of the food at Assab is some of the best I've had of Ethiopian/Eritrean in SF (on par with New Eritra). I would highly suggest this place to introduce someone to this exotic cuisine (and dispel any misconceptions about dinosaur meat...). Since the combination samplings are so small, I recommend picking a few full entrees if you are sharing with a group of people. That way there will be more to go around and more chances to determine if you like it or not.

Vegetables are really hard to make flavorful and cook just right but Assab succeeded on all counts.  Both the zucchini and okra dishes, things that could be disastrous in the wrong hands, were so tasty and were cooked perfectly.\n\nAs usual with Ethiopian/Eritrean food, we ate way too much so we had to skip dessert.

When we asked for the plate, the waitress brought exactly that, one plate, without the bred/crepe/fluffy dough thing. We could not believe it. Patrick ended up giving her his plate. I mean, how much can one crepe cost them? $0.10? less? My friend barely ate anything anyway. *sigh* I hate when crappy service interferes with such a great experience.\n\nOnce we got past the terrible service, we took the first bite out of this delicious sampling of flavors. I could not believe what I was eating. This is the most fantastic, beyond delicious food I have ever had. Nothing can compare to this. \n\nThe experience of sharing your food is also an experience. Kind of like saying \"what's mine is yours.\" \nAll three of us loved the food and even if it was spicier than we had anticipated, we would have asked for seconds if we were still hungry. \n\nI am hooked and will look forward to another Eritrean dinner for more years to come. \n\nThe four stars is strictly based on my horrible experience with the service, had it not been for that, I would have given five. The service was so bad, in fact, that I will try other Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurants before ever returning to Assab in hopes that I find one with better service and equally incredible food.\nUnfortunately for me, this is one of those places where you have to choose between good food or good service.\n\n*disclaimer*\nI did get sick on my plane-ride back, but it's because i'm not used to the spices. Those who are trying this food for the first time and are not used to spice cannot overdo-it like I did. It will not sit well in your tummy.

I came here once with my parents, and after we ordered, I sat in there and read several chapters of a book while they walked over to Trader Joe's for a stroll.  When they came back 45 minutes later, the food still wasn't served.  Same thing happened the other few times I came here.  I am impatient, so making me wait = terribad.  Another reason why it's a good idea to come here with a good group of people to pass the time with. \n\nJust a note on Eritrean etiquette:  Eat with your right hand.

Dinosaur?\" Aghast at my mom's ignorance but also bemused at her strange sense of humor (maybe that's where I get it from?), I tried to explain the wonders of this complex, yet humble cuisine. There is something very primally satisfying about eating with your hands, with the injera serving more as a sponge for all the delightfully seasoned sauces than as a utensil. Ordinary meats like beef, chicken, and lamb are taken to a level most Western or Eastern palates have not experienced. At least, that's what *good* Eritrean/Ethiopean food is like...and Assab most definitely delivers with a delectable dining endeavor.\n\nOn this trip, we ordered:\n\n- Vegetable Sambusa: started out with this nicely sized fried envelope stuffed with green peas, carrots and spices. It was a little messy to eat, and I was surprised that it wasn't served with some kind of sauce. Not bad for $2.\n\n- Shiro: pureed chick peas, whose consistency conjured up thoughts of something between baby food and whipped mashed potatoes. I'm on the fence whether that's a good or bad thing. The flavor fares more positively, well seasoned and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and pepper.\n\n- Meat combination: which included small portions of the:\n#3 Zigni: small pieces of beef cooked with onions, tomato, butter, and an added kick of hot pepper. This was quite good, though the beef was a little chewier than I would have liked and the butter flavor was not as strong as at New Eritrea.\n\n#4. Tsebhi - Derho: we got one chicken leg on the bone (though you can also get thighs), cooked in a sauce similar to the Zigni. I really wish that there was more meat to this...will definitely have to try it as a full entree and not as part of the meat combo next time.\n\n# 8. Alicha-beggee: cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots and bell peppers. The flavor was strong, without being overpoweringly \"lamby.\" I believe Michael Bauer has used that exact term.\n\n- Vegetable combination: a sampling of three standby Ethiopean vegetable dishes:\n#13. Veg alicha: Potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cabbage are subtly seasoned and melt in your mouth. Toss up between this and New Eritrea.\n\n#14. Okra: delicious stew of okra that does a good job of riding the line of texture for okra; not too firm, and not too slimy.\n\n#15. Zucchini: probably the weakest link, similar in seasoning to the okra. I am not a huge zuchini fan, so meh.\n\nThe injera that Assab uses is very good, though I do think that New Eritrea wins in this category. Assab's injera seems to be structurally a bit too thin. If you look at the structure of the surface of the injera, you'll see that it is very \"holey.\" I think that this is why the injera falls apart so easily while handling the food.  The taste is also a bit on the mild side for me and could have used a bit more tang. Another bummer is that they only give you one piece of injera per person; New Eritrea gives you two. An extra only costs $0.75, so it's not a huge deal but something to note. Assab also has super cheap drinks - a bottle of honey wine is $19, by the glass is $5. Imported beers are no more than $3.75, and fruit juices are good as well. As far as the service, I think that our waitress secretly hated us because we took forever to decide. We also thought it was strange that they didn't give us small plates when we ordered our appetizer.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the seasoning of the food at Assab is some of the best I've had of Ethiopian/Eritrean in SF (on par with New Eritra). I would highly suggest this place to introduce someone to this exotic cuisine (and dispel any misconceptions about dinosaur meat...). Since the combination samplings are so small, I recommend picking a few full entrees if you are sharing with a group of people.

We also ordered four additional injera's.  The way to eat is you tear the injera into pieces and dip it into the stews.  The injera is quite interesting as it's a bit sour tasting.  It reminded me of a crumpet with all the little holes, but a lot thinner.  Injera is a flatbread made from teff, wheat, or sorghum.  \n\nThe meat combination came with beef, chicken, and lamb.  I'm not sure how the beef and lamb tasted as I don't eat either.  However, the chicken was delicious. It was a skinless drumstick simmered with clarified butter, onions, tomatoes and seasoned hot pepper.  It had good heat.  \n\nThe vegetable combination came with medium-mildly seasoned, potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, okra, & zucchini.

"], "author": "Steph P.", "review": "When I told my mother that I was taking my brother to eat Eritrean/Ethiopian food, she said with a laugh, \"What do you eat at Ethiopian? Dinosaur?\" Aghast at my mom's ignorance but also bemused at her strange sense of humor (maybe that's where I get it from?), I tried to explain the wonders of this complex, yet humble cuisine. There is something very primally satisfying about eating with your hands, with the injera serving more as a sponge for all the delightfully seasoned sauces than as a utensil. Ordinary meats like beef, chicken, and lamb are taken to a level most Western or Eastern palates have not experienced. At least, that's what *good* Eritrean/Ethiopean food is like...and Assab most definitely delivers with a delectable dining endeavor.\n\nOn this trip, we ordered:\n\n- Vegetable Sambusa: started out with this nicely sized fried envelope stuffed with green peas, carrots and spices. It was a little messy to eat, and I was surprised that it wasn't served with some kind of sauce. Not bad for $2.\n\n- Shiro: pureed chick peas, whose consistency conjured up thoughts of something between baby food and whipped mashed potatoes. I'm on the fence whether that's a good or bad thing. The flavor fares more positively, well seasoned and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and pepper.\n\n- Meat combination: which included small portions of the:\n#3 Zigni: small pieces of beef cooked with onions, tomato, butter, and an added kick of hot pepper. This was quite good, though the beef was a little chewier than I would have liked and the butter flavor was not as strong as at New Eritrea.\n\n#4. Tsebhi - Derho: we got one chicken leg on the bone (though you can also get thighs), cooked in a sauce similar to the Zigni. I really wish that there was more meat to this...will definitely have to try it as a full entree and not as part of the meat combo next time.\n\n# 8. Alicha-beggee: cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots and bell peppers. The flavor was strong, without being overpoweringly \"lamby.\" I believe Michael Bauer has used that exact term.\n\n- Vegetable combination: a sampling of three standby Ethiopean vegetable dishes:\n#13. Veg alicha: Potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cabbage are subtly seasoned and melt in your mouth. Toss up between this and New Eritrea.\n\n#14. Okra: delicious stew of okra that does a good job of riding the line of texture for okra; not too firm, and not too slimy.\n\n#15. Zucchini: probably the weakest link, similar in seasoning to the okra. I am not a huge zuchini fan, so meh.\n\nThe injera that Assab uses is very good, though I do think that New Eritrea wins in this category. Assab's injera seems to be structurally a bit too thin. If you look at the structure of the surface of the injera, you'll see that it is very \"holey.\" I think that this is why the injera falls apart so easily while handling the food.  The taste is also a bit on the mild side for me and could have used a bit more tang. Another bummer is that they only give you one piece of injera per person; New Eritrea gives you two. An extra only costs $0.75, so it's not a huge deal but something to note. Assab also has super cheap drinks - a bottle of honey wine is $19, by the glass is $5. Imported beers are no more than $3.75, and fruit juices are good as well. As far as the service, I think that our waitress secretly hated us because we took forever to decide. We also thought it was strange that they didn't give us small plates when we ordered our appetizer.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the seasoning of the food at Assab is some of the best I've had of Ethiopian/Eritrean in SF (on par with New Eritra). I would highly suggest this place to introduce someone to this exotic cuisine (and dispel any misconceptions about dinosaur meat...). Since the combination samplings are so small, I recommend picking a few full entrees if you are sharing with a group of people.

"], "author": "Steph P.", "review": "When I told my mother that I was taking my brother to eat Eritrean/Ethiopian food, she said with a laugh, \"What do you eat at Ethiopian? Dinosaur?\" Aghast at my mom's ignorance but also bemused at her strange sense of humor (maybe that's where I get it from?), I tried to explain the wonders of this complex, yet humble cuisine. There is something very primally satisfying about eating with your hands, with the injera serving more as a sponge for all the delightfully seasoned sauces than as a utensil. Ordinary meats like beef, chicken, and lamb are taken to a level most Western or Eastern palates have not experienced. At least, that's what *good* Eritrean/Ethiopean food is like...and Assab most definitely delivers with a delectable dining endeavor.\n\nOn this trip, we ordered:\n\n- Vegetable Sambusa: started out with this nicely sized fried envelope stuffed with green peas, carrots and spices. It was a little messy to eat, and I was surprised that it wasn't served with some kind of sauce. Not bad for $2.\n\n- Shiro: pureed chick peas, whose consistency conjured up thoughts of something between baby food and whipped mashed potatoes. I'm on the fence whether that's a good or bad thing. The flavor fares more positively, well seasoned and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and pepper.\n\n- Meat combination: which included small portions of the:\n#3 Zigni: small pieces of beef cooked with onions, tomato, butter, and an added kick of hot pepper. This was quite good, though the beef was a little chewier than I would have liked and the butter flavor was not as strong as at New Eritrea.\n\n#4. Tsebhi - Derho: we got one chicken leg on the bone (though you can also get thighs), cooked in a sauce similar to the Zigni. I really wish that there was more meat to this...will definitely have to try it as a full entree and not as part of the meat combo next time.\n\n# 8. Alicha-beggee: cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots and bell peppers. The flavor was strong, without being overpoweringly \"lamby.\" I believe Michael Bauer has used that exact term.\n\n- Vegetable combination: a sampling of three standby Ethiopean vegetable dishes:\n#13. Veg alicha: Potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cabbage are subtly seasoned and melt in your mouth. Toss up between this and New Eritrea.\n\n#14. Okra: delicious stew of okra that does a good job of riding the line of texture for okra; not too firm, and not too slimy.\n\n#15. Zucchini: probably the weakest link, similar in seasoning to the okra. I am not a huge zuchini fan, so meh.\n\nThe injera that Assab uses is very good, though I do think that New Eritrea wins in this category. Assab's injera seems to be structurally a bit too thin. If you look at the structure of the surface of the injera, you'll see that it is very \"holey.\" I think that this is why the injera falls apart so easily while handling the food.  The taste is also a bit on the mild side for me and could have used a bit more tang. Another bummer is that they only give you one piece of injera per person; New Eritrea gives you two. An extra only costs $0.75, so it's not a huge deal but something to note. Assab also has super cheap drinks - a bottle of honey wine is $19, by the glass is $5. Imported beers are no more than $3.75, and fruit juices are good as well. As far as the service, I think that our waitress secretly hated us because we took forever to decide. We also thought it was strange that they didn't give us small plates when we ordered our appetizer.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the seasoning of the food at Assab is some of the best I've had of Ethiopian/Eritrean in SF (on par with New Eritra). I would highly suggest this place to introduce someone to this exotic cuisine (and dispel any misconceptions about dinosaur meat...). Since the combination samplings are so small, I recommend picking a few full entrees if you are sharing with a group of people.
