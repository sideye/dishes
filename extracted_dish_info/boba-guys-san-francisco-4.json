I sampled her drink (trying to strategically sip it so I didn't suck up a tapioca pearl through the straw) and it was a superbly made tea drink, too! The green tea had a mellow, natural flavorings combined with a hint of a floral-esque taste.\n\nFYI, the tea drinks can also be ordered as a hot version (12 or 16 oz size); iced version (16 or 24 oz size). And there are four milk options to choose from, including vegan options: organic dairy milk (the milk I chose for my tea drink), almond milk, oat milk, or no milk.\n\nOverall, an exceptional milk tea experience!

You can learn a lot about this place just by reading those signs.\n\nSo basically there are two big categories on their menu: specialty or signature drinks, and slow drip tea. For the latter category, you can choose sweetness and whether you want to add milk in it (and they have organic milk, California farm milk or soy milk as well). First time here, let me try their slow drip tea and see if they have done the fundamentals right.\n\n\n\n-) Muscat Oolong Milk Tea with boba: A. They brewed the tea fresh from your order, turn the teapot/funnel thing upside down, and literally let the tea drip slowly. After it's done, they would pour it into a prepared beaker with iced milk, and there you go your drink. When I first sipped it, it definitely had a very strong oolong tea flavor in it. I really like the fact that the milk was not creamy at all; rather, the milk helped bring out the taste of the tea, make it more smooth, and definitely enhanced the overall experience. Boba was definitely way above average. Soft and chewy, but it's not honey boba so it's not sweet at all, which actually makes sense or else it would not go well with the strong flavor tea.\n\nDefinitely a place that I will be visiting more often.

The only thing that would make this even more awesome is if the employees wore white lab coats and safety glasses while making the boba.

You get to choose your size (16 oz - 24 oz), toppings (tapioca, almond jelly, grass jelly), Milk (Straus Family Organic Milk, Almond Milk, Soy milk), and sweetness level (see chart on wall). \n\nStrawberry Jasmine Tea-Fresco is good. It's sweet and I feel like you can taste the flavors of the strawberry. My bf ordered the Strawberry-Calpico Tea-Fresco and was a bit disappointed because he felt that it didn't taste like Calpico. I got a sip of his drink and it tasted like my drink, mixed with yogurt - so I guess you can say strawberry yogurt..but in liquid form? Haha. \nI also ordered a Hong Kong Style Toast with condensed milk, which was 1 thick toast, sliced into 1/4th's, with whipped cream spread and honey or condensed milk drizzled over it. Was a bit of a disappointment for me, but slightly met my expectation.. \n\nOverall, I think I would come back if I was in the area. It's a bit of a drive since I am not in the area often, looking for parking is complicated, and the drinks remind me of T pumps - only difference is that they use organic products and loose-leaf tea instead of powder. Also, I'm sure the lines are long during the day (came at night) and it's just too much of a hipster hype for me :(", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-01-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Horchata, Hong Kong style, Chamomile Mint, Pumpkin Chai, Muscat Oolong, and Coconut Green Tea.\n5.

People are just convincing themselve it's good because of the marketing (that's marketing anyway). I don't know which is worse, Tea Pumps or this place. And if you think Tea Pumps is good, you're not Asian enough or you're too Americanized to know what is \"good.\" (Americanized versions of Asian things are always bad if you've tried the Asian-original, whether it be movies or food) And Tea Pumps and Boba Guys are oviously the PF Changs of Chinese food. \"chinese\" food.\n\nFor a company that markets themselves as meticulous guys scientifically crafting the best milk tea recipes, I'd say these scientists missed the mark pretty hard. I think it was not so much meticulous crafting, but more just a few guys in a kitchen mixing stuff together without the slightest culinary skill or wit whatsover... like college dorm kids that don't know how to cook or mix flavors... because these are by far the worst ratios and recipes I've ever had, aside from Tea Pumps.  \n\nPolitical news needs to fact-check, BobaGuys needs to flavor-check. But they really need to think about flavors not so much in a scientific process. It's also wit and experience in a culinary sense. Like I said, it's like college dorm kids without the slightest sophistication of taste or the slightest art of cooking trying to play with a bunch of beakers n pans. Mixing flavors and devising combinations is wit and intuition, not calculation and process.\n\n-------------\nI came in with a large party and tried several flavors:\n\nJasmine milk tea: I often jude a milk tea shop by this standard. It's classic, simple, but takes understanding of milk tea to get it PROPERLY made. Well, these guys managed to screw this up. 3 of us ordered it just to be sure. And yes, they all came out identically disgusting.  -- too watery, yet milk to tea ratio... too much milk--so it tasted plain. 75% sweet. 100% sweet. Both pointless It's like adding more sugar to water. The tea was standard jasmine but more importantly, the ratios were all wrong. \n\nEarl Grey Milk tea: This is my staple order at any milk tea place that would serve it. I've tried it EVERYWHERE. You can say I'm a bit of a harlot for earl grey milk tea... I've been everywhere for it. Well, Boba Guys destroyed this drink. Good job. B for effort. \nIt was too watery; had a sharp hint of lychee; had a gross accent of lavender, which I now assume they used the BUTT of all teas--TAZO.. or they used the post 2012 Mighty Leaf version of Earl Grey... which is beyond butt.. and I distinctly remember that nightmare to this day, and I slightly relived it in this milk tea. And the tea to mlik to water ratio was obviously wrong. It just did NOT taste good.\n\nHorchatta Milk tea: not bad. not great. It was like a watery Horchatta with boba. Not so great. They're better off with the store-bought and just throwing boba in it. They don't know how to make horchatta properly.\n\nHong Kong Style: This was their best drink out of the lot. Surprisingly, for such a terrible milk tea place that Americanized the milk tea industry like Tea Pumps, which just means... detroying it.... they managed to get HONG KONG STYLE pretty good. I tried this one last in the lot... maybe anything par would seem good.\n\nI'm not a fan of Quickly's or TapEx, but there are a few with owners that really know how to make it.

The only thing that would make this even more awesome is if the employees wore white lab coats and safety glasses while making the boba.

Not too bad! I couldn't really taste the tea flavor at first because it was pretty sweet, but after a few stirs, it was the perfect balance. It's a little harder to \"shake it up\" since the drink comes with a lid as opposed to being vacuum sealed like some other places are.\n\nThe staff here is very friendly and lets you take your time when you order. They also have merchandise with the Boba Guys logo here as well as some homemade cotton candy. The Li Hing Pineapple flavored cotton candy was pretty great! Better than I expected. Also, their almond jelly and grass jelly are homemade too!\n\nI would definitely come here again to try the other tea flavors (they have speciality tea flavors as well) and the other toppings.

They were part of a commercial the day we went, so the film crew had some miscellaneous supplies that were piled up by the wall. Service was also slower and the line was out the door, so the owner gave everyone 15% off their orders, which was unexpected but definitely appreciated.

I've seen their anteater while perusing Instagram and was already intrigued. It's so cute and such a simple but memorable and effective marketing tactic as a newcomer to the already-saturated boba market. \n\nGood, but not great:\n-Iced original milk tea with boba. I can tell that the quality of the tea leaves is not the best I've had (e.g., Ten Ren/Tastea). It's not that strong. As I continued to drink my 16 oz tea, it becomes a bit more diluted, more so than is expected with ice melting. \n-Same with boba...good, but not great. I can't pinpoint it exactly, but I think I would have preferred it to be more QQ and honey-infused. I am a boba fiend, or nitpicky amateur boba connoisseur at best. \n\nSkip:\n-Jasmine milk tea.

A variety of incomparably revitalizing house-made tea blends sets Boba Guys apart from other Bay Area boba joints.\nBoba Guys offers both heated and iced drinks from a menu of year-round flavors like jasmine, horchata and \"classic milk,\" and a choice between three additions -- referred to as toppings -- include its popular tapioca pearls and house-made grass and almond jellies.\nWhile most boba shops in the Bay Area rely heavily on artificial syrups and flavorings, Boba Guys' use of natural and organic resources captures distinct flavors. Real jasmine, rose, strawberry and lavender exemplify the best of its signature and seasonal blends.\nNervous first-time visitors might want to start with the Jasmine Milk Tea, its flavor a step above the basic, but no-less-tasty Classic Milk Tea.\nThe premium Indian Chai and Rose Black Tea stand apart as original and astonishingly rich blends. The chai blend achieves the ideal balance between sugar and spice without sweetener.\nSeasonal selections include a light Strawberry Jasmine Fresca, which makes for the perfect refreshment, but a large is suggested because a regular 16-ounce cup leaves the customer wanting more.\nThe locally-sourced organic Straus Creamery milk has a tendency to be too thick and creamy for my taste, albeit better than the Coffeemate creamer powder used by other boba tea shops. Soy milk and Califia Almondmilk are perhaps better alternative options.\nA house-made simple syrup of white and brown sugars that sweetens all drinks overwhelms most tastes, but chatting with the \"bobaristas\" increases the customer's chances of getting the perfect level of sweetness.\nCustomizable high quality thirst-quenchers served with a smile from bobaristas for around $5 constitutes a steal by San Francisco standards.\nBoba Guys is located at 19th and Valencia streets and on Stockton Street in Union Square. Loose-leaf tea blends are available online. The 19th Street location is open noon to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, until 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 6 p.m. on Sunday.

And the tea to mlik to water ratio was obviously wrong. It just did NOT taste good.\n\nHorchatta Milk tea: not bad. not great. It was like a watery Horchatta with boba. Not so great. They're better off with the store-bought and just throwing boba in it. They don't know how to make horchatta properly.\n\nHong Kong Style: This was their best drink out of the lot. Surprisingly, for such a terrible milk tea place that Americanized the milk tea industry like Tea Pumps, which just means... detroying it.... they managed to get HONG KONG STYLE pretty good.

I couldn't wait to try your boba and milk teas and i must say i have once again been disappointed.  However, you guys do have a lot of potential to make really good boba.  I can tell from what i was drinking!!! \n\nthe problems: \n1.  Not enough boba!!! come guys, boba is cheap.  I'm sure you will make a lot more people happy if you just added a little bit more boba in there.  \n\n2. it's too sweet!! many boba places will customize the sweetness level.  When i asked for half the sweetness, the response was oo everything is pre-made.  Yes that kinda turned me off.  I have no problem with your pre-made teas.  My problem is the fact that you can't make it less sweet because it is pre-made.   \n\n3.  have less random hours.  people might enjoy a cup of boba milk tea after dinner. you guys are located in a hub of restaurants why not have later hours.  \n\nWhy i think you guys have potential to make REALLY good boba milk tea:\n1. the boba balls are chewy but not too chewy.  It has a nice sweetness too it (hence you can make your tea less sweet!!!!!) \n\n2. the tea has really good flavor.  I got the milk tea and my sister got the jasmine milk tea.  When i tried the jasmine milk tea, my first response was WHOA!!!! that is jasmine.  Love the flavor and the smoothness of your teas.  Don't let that hide behind all the sweetness.  \n\n3.

Half the time I go there they see me in line and by the time I get up to pay my drink has already been made! \n\nGiving a one star because you think it's too expensive is not providing new customers with good information about the product, it's just complaining.

During the time we were there, 30-40 people were trying to occupy that space all at once. There was a literal line that went out the door and down past the next door building and a number of people passing us by were calling us crazy. Which, screw you too, buddy. But that does highlight the point that this place wasn't really built to have a whole lot of people sit down and linger here, though they did say their other locations ARE. They all seem to have a clean, almost See's-candy like aesthetic, but more hipster. Largely relies on natural light, which I appreciate. \n\nTo me, Boba Guys covers an variety of styles and types of milk tea (Thai Tea, Hong Kong Tea, your give coffee milk tea) and a number of different kinds of teas. It's gratifying because you usually go to one place and they have an assortment of that TYPE of tea/milk tea (ex. a list of Hong Kong styled milk tea + [insert flavor]). They also have a variety of snacks at the front container. There were SMALL WAFFLES, OKAY. THEY LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS. Oh, and for those who haven't had this kind of matcha latte before where the layers are initially separate, remember to Instagram or whatever first, then stir it before drinking. They also keep a pitcher of water and a stack off cups on the side table where the straws are, or at least they did while we were there. If you see that the pitcher(s) is empty, move or leave it on the pickup counter so the staff doesn't have to wade out into the crowd to get it. It also has the bonus of getting the pitcher refilled more quickly. Anyways, their milk tea isn't overly sweet, but I'd highly recommend the 25% level of sweetness. My friend found her 50% matcha latte to be a bit on the sweeter side and I'm inclined to agree. I'm hoping to visit one of their other locations soon, they're spreading like wildfire!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-17"}, {"excerpts": ["So far, I've tried the Classic, Thai, Jasmine, Iced Matcha Latte and Hong Kong Style.

It's located smack-dab right in the Mission, surrounded by tons of yummy restaurants and pretty close to the Castro and Dolores Park! BEWARE THOUGH, parking can be a nightmare though and it might take you a while to find. The shop itself is pretty small, and there's usually a line of customers trailing down the sidewalk. The wait can be long, but it's worth it if you have the time. This is a great place to grab boba after lunch or dinner with friends or family! \n\nWhat's great about their drinks is that you can alter the sweetness and ice level, and for the ones that have milk you can substitute it for a non-dairy version, such almond milk or oat milk! So far, I've tried the Classic, Thai, Jasmine, Iced Matcha Latte and Hong Kong Style. My favorite has to be the Hong Kong Style and Thai Tea.

Boba Guys has been on my radar for quite a while, so CARPE DIEM! My biggest woe was that I circled around the one-way 19th and 20th streets for 15+ minutes to find parking. I mean literally every nook and cranny were taken up. I parked on a curb not so legally...and just ran inside to grab my boba fix. The neighborhood isn't pretty either. I went around 7PM but I would not stay here when the sun sets...it looks completely muggy and robby. \n\n[[AMBIANCE]]\nThere were about 6-8 people inside the boba shop which made it way too crowded. I was getting claustrophobic. They have a few chairs around with a counter top but it's by no means an enjoyable atmosphere to relax at. The vibe is modern trendy with their minimalistic and hipster decorations. Their menu is limited but only to keep the quality of their products. So don't expect a 100+ items menu like TapEx haha, they only have the basics- classic milk tea, green, Thai, taro, etc.\n\n[[MILK TEAS]]\nTheir organic teas are authentic. It mirrored Ten Ren's taste and quality which impressed me greatly. I opted for the regular sweetness since I wanted to taste how they originally made it- big mistake. Both the Classic Milk Tea and especially the Thai Tea were wayyy too sweet, and I like Dr. Pepper so my sweet palate is already pretty high bar. \n\n[[BOBA PEARLS]]\nHowever, their boba pearls were cooked to perfection. You must try it. There is a difference between OVERCOOKED and Perfectly Cooked pearls-- Boba Guys does it right! If the pearls were overcooked, you would taste a soggy, fuzzy texture surrounding the core of the tapioca pearls before you bite into it. There would be a clear difference in textures of the outer vs inner layer of the balls. Perfectly cooked pearls are soft and chewy and with each bite, the texture is always consistent from the outer layer to the inner layer. \n\nThumb rule about boba pearls: If your tongue is confused by the texture, it's overcooked. If your tongue is soothed by the consistent soft, chewy texture through each bite, it's perfectly cooked.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-08-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Matcha tea \nStrawberry matcha\nThai tea\n\n"], "author": "Jennie D.", "review": "The hype is real and the line is worth the wait.

They have a statement on their outside window by the door about how they put a lot if science into their boba making process, which is pretty clever. The only thing that would make this even more awesome is if the employees wore white lab coats and safety glasses while making the boba. But I guess that would be really hot - it was already a warm day in the Mission when I visited and it gets pretty warm inside this little shop, especially with lots of people inside. They also had some fans on, so maybe there's no central AC. So...maybe no lab coats...\n\nThey also sell cute mason jars with their logo (I think it's an aardvark? They like boba too!) for $10.

The people who make the drinks are cheery enough, despite dealing with a large crowd that's been waiting for their sugar fix for way too long.

My friends and I waited for 10 to 20 minutes for basic brewed tea, even sans toppings.\n\nThe people who make your drinks aren't the friendliest, though, when it comes to modifying your drink, so you better hope that they make it the way you like it the first time, or risk getting some begrudging stares. \n\nDrinks and Food:\nAlthough the drinks are customizable, there is still a limit on how little sugar you can add to the drink.

Their boba is fairly sweet, so even if you get 0% sugar, if you get boba with it-- the drink is still bound to be somewhat sweet. I really appreciate their slow bar here because you know they're brewing you up some fresh tea :) If you order from the slow bar, it takes around 3-5 minutes for them to brew your tea and serve your drink. It goes by fast though, I promise. My favourites off the basic menu are the matcha and the hong kong (always down for condensed milk!) But if you want to be adventurous, I'm a huge fan of the Golden Honey Black (which has a hint of sweetness to it, even at low sweetness levels) and the Rose Black Tea (floral af, but soooo delicious.) The boba is always at perfect consistency-- chewy and warm, but like I said before-- I think they store their boba in a simple syrup mixture because it's super sweet and will add sweetness to your drink. \n\nIf you're down for snacks, the cotton candy from Sugar & Spun is sold here, and they have outrageous weird flavours-- my favourite being the Li Hing Pineapple.

While one of circle around, the 3 of us jumped out to get in NO line (woo-hoo!) and ordered.\n\nThis location is very small with no where to sit or really to stick around for long.  This place is more of a \"take-out\" place.\n\nLooking at their menu, I can see what the big deal was! They seem to have a variety of unique Boba drinks that I don't usually see at other Boba spots.  They also have merchandise, haha.\n\nSo here's what I had:\n\nMATCHATA (16 oz) - $4.75\n+$0.50 Boba \nA secret menu item turned not-so-secret.  Organic matcha whisked over their house made horchata.\nSee what I mean?!! Matcha AND horchata!!! I could I possibly pass this up!  The only thing about this one is there is no sweetness adjustment, which I'm completely fine about.  I did like how it's not so sweet.  Besides you get a lot of the sweetness from the warm and chewy (pretty much perfect) tapioca balls.  When this was given to me, you have the bottom layer of the warm boba, then the white layer of matcha, and the top layer is the matcha.  You stir it and let be ice mix it all up! This taste was quite unique--you get this slight gritty semi-sweet texture from the horchata and the earthy taste from the matcha.  I recommend trying this one.\n\nKAYA TOAST - $3.50\nA thick slice of brioche toast served warm with their own housemade kaya coconut jam.\nSo the kaya coconut jam is like this sweet custardy spread that is mixed with coconut milk and has pandan leaf flavor.  The consistency is like condensed milk.  The Boba Guys made their very own!  This took some time to make but the it's worth it!

And unlike traditional boba shops, these guys aren't nearly as fast at cutting down the line.\n\nI guess my biggest complaint is how pretentious everything feels. Slow brew tea. C'mon, really? All tea is slow brew. You brew tea by steeping it in hot water. This is the way tea has been brewed for thousands of years. It's nothing new.\n\nAnd then there's this acrylic contraption that's supposed to look like a coffee siphon bar. But unlike a coffee siphon, you're not watching water steam in separate chambers, forcing hot water through a filter. Again, they're just steeping tea in hot water. It's silly. \n\nTo top it all off there's all this stuff on the menu boasting about the best quality ingredients from around the world. And as I'm reading this, I'm watching the hipster kids behind the counter use Kirkland cinnamon and vanilla. Don't get me wrong, I love Costco. But I don't consider Costco ingredients rare or exotic.\n\nAnyway, the tea was alright. I had the horchata boba. It had a good flavor without being too sweet. And since most boba shops have at least 30 different flavors, to find something fresh and unique is notable. My wife's green tea with coconut milk and almond jello was also a nice twist. I liked that.\n\nAnd for about $3.50 a pop, which is just about the same price you'd pay for this stuff on Clement Street or in Chinatown, it's not a bad deal.

People are just convincing themselve it's good because of the marketing (that's marketing anyway). I don't know which is worse, Tea Pumps or this place. And if you think Tea Pumps is good, you're not Asian enough or you're too Americanized to know what is \"good.\" (Americanized versions of Asian things are always bad if you've tried the Asian-original, whether it be movies or food) And Tea Pumps and Boba Guys are oviously the PF Changs of Chinese food. \"chinese\" food.\n\nFor a company that markets themselves as meticulous guys scientifically crafting the best milk tea recipes, I'd say these scientists missed the mark pretty hard. I think it was not so much meticulous crafting, but more just a few guys in a kitchen mixing stuff together without the slightest culinary skill or wit whatsover... like college dorm kids that don't know how to cook or mix flavors... because these are by far the worst ratios and recipes I've ever had, aside from Tea Pumps.  \n\nPolitical news needs to fact-check, BobaGuys needs to flavor-check. But they really need to think about flavors not so much in a scientific process. It's also wit and experience in a culinary sense. Like I said, it's like college dorm kids without the slightest sophistication of taste or the slightest art of cooking trying to play with a bunch of beakers n pans. Mixing flavors and devising combinations is wit and intuition, not calculation and process.\n\n-------------\nI came in with a large party and tried several flavors:\n\nJasmine milk tea: I often jude a milk tea shop by this standard. It's classic, simple, but takes understanding of milk tea to get it PROPERLY made. Well, these guys managed to screw this up. 3 of us ordered it just to be sure. And yes, they all came out identically disgusting.  -- too watery, yet milk to tea ratio... too much milk--so it tasted plain. 75% sweet. 100% sweet. Both pointless It's like adding more sugar to water. The tea was standard jasmine but more importantly, the ratios were all wrong. \n\nEarl Grey Milk tea: This is my staple order at any milk tea place that would serve it. I've tried it EVERYWHERE. You can say I'm a bit of a harlot for earl grey milk tea... I've been everywhere for it. Well, Boba Guys destroyed this drink. Good job. B for effort. \nIt was too watery; had a sharp hint of lychee; had a gross accent of lavender, which I now assume they used the BUTT of all teas--TAZO.. or they used the post 2012 Mighty Leaf version of Earl Grey... which is beyond butt.. and I distinctly remember that nightmare to this day, and I slightly relived it in this milk tea. And the tea to mlik to water ratio was obviously wrong. It just did NOT taste good.\n\nHorchatta Milk tea: not bad. not great. It was like a watery Horchatta with boba. Not so great. They're better off with the store-bought and just throwing boba in it. They don't know how to make horchatta properly.\n\nHong Kong Style: This was their best drink out of the lot. Surprisingly, for such a terrible milk tea place that Americanized the milk tea industry like Tea Pumps, which just means... detroying it.... they managed to get HONG KONG STYLE pretty good. I tried this one last in the lot... maybe anything par would seem good.\n\nI'm not a fan of Quickly's or TapEx, but there are a few with owners that really know how to make it.

A variety of incomparably revitalizing house-made tea blends sets Boba Guys apart from other Bay Area boba joints.\nBoba Guys offers both heated and iced drinks from a menu of year-round flavors like jasmine, horchata and \"classic milk,\" and a choice between three additions -- referred to as toppings -- include its popular tapioca pearls and house-made grass and almond jellies.\nWhile most boba shops in the Bay Area rely heavily on artificial syrups and flavorings, Boba Guys' use of natural and organic resources captures distinct flavors. Real jasmine, rose, strawberry and lavender exemplify the best of its signature and seasonal blends.\nNervous first-time visitors might want to start with the Jasmine Milk Tea, its flavor a step above the basic, but no-less-tasty Classic Milk Tea.\nThe premium Indian Chai and Rose Black Tea stand apart as original and astonishingly rich blends. The chai blend achieves the ideal balance between sugar and spice without sweetener.\nSeasonal selections include a light Strawberry Jasmine Fresca, which makes for the perfect refreshment, but a large is suggested because a regular 16-ounce cup leaves the customer wanting more.\nThe locally-sourced organic Straus Creamery milk has a tendency to be too thick and creamy for my taste, albeit better than the Coffeemate creamer powder used by other boba tea shops. Soy milk and Califia Almondmilk are perhaps better alternative options.\nA house-made simple syrup of white and brown sugars that sweetens all drinks overwhelms most tastes, but chatting with the \"bobaristas\" increases the customer's chances of getting the perfect level of sweetness.\nCustomizable high quality thirst-quenchers served with a smile from bobaristas for around $5 constitutes a steal by San Francisco standards.\nBoba Guys is located at 19th and Valencia streets and on Stockton Street in Union Square. Loose-leaf tea blends are available online. The 19th Street location is open noon to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, until 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 6 p.m. on Sunday.

I really like the fact that the milk was not creamy at all; rather, the milk helped bring out the taste of the tea, make it more smooth, and definitely enhanced the overall experience. Boba was definitely way above average. Soft and chewy, but it's not honey boba so it's not sweet at all, which actually makes sense or else it would not go well with the strong flavor tea.\n\nDefinitely a place that I will be visiting more often.
