It really makes me want to try using tea eggs the next time I cook deviled eggs for an event. The braised lamb noodle was absolutely amazing despite the portion size feeling a bit small. The lamb had that nice mild gamey flavor in it and went well with the chillies and sauce. The noodles were truly the star of the dish however, being wonderfully chewy and hand cut.

With higher price points, it's fine if you're expensing your meal to your company, but I probably wouldn't come back, given other options for Asian food, and Asian fusion in San Francisco. I guess it's good for big groups and tourists, but there are far better places out in the city that you're missing out on if you eat here!\n\nChicken Satay ($13) - They at least use free-range chicken, but this is expensive for what it is. I've had similar chicken satay at Thai restaurants for half the price. Get this if you really are craving chicken satay, but I'd pass on this and save it for the next time you go to a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant.\n\nButternut Squash Dumplings ($13) - These are a bit pricey for dumplings, since you get 6 of them for $13. If you're really craving dumplings, go to a place that specialized in dumplings in the Outer Sunset. But if you're craving dumplings and willing to pay a little bit more, then these are fine. The sweet butternut squash filling makes it taste like a butternut squash ravioli, and almost a little bit on the dessert side since it's sweet. Good, but not amazing.\n\nIndonesian Corn Fritters ($9) - As if you couldn't tell by the name, these are pieces of corn, held together by batter and deep fried into small-burger-sized patties. If you don't like food with spices or cumin, it's best to avoid these. They are good and a better bang for your buck than some of the other appetizers, but almost any thing deep-fried is good.\n\nCod with Water Spinach ($27) - I love a nicely cooked miso glazed cod, but for $27 it was a little bit lackluster. It seemed like they just saut\u00e9ed spinach in a pan and threw a small piece of fish on it. It wasn't bad, but not worth $27.  It's similar to PF Chang's cod, but at a more expensive price. I was hungry when I finished my entr\u00e9e.\n\nIf you're not paying out of your own pocket, this is a fine place to go if you're looking for somewhere to seat a big party, or you're traveling, staying in Union Square and want something close by.

Fusion was the latest trend back then, and it was an especially popular place for company dinner parties because the food spanned all parts of the Far East. That was at a time in my life when I probably thought of myself as a rising, semi-young Asian professional with dreams of the C-suite and a private secretary who gave me politically incorrect back rubs... yes, I said 'back'. Flash forward fifteen years and there ain't nothing young about me anymore, semi or otherwise. Rising? Yes...out of my bed. C-suite? Oh brother. And that private secretary is probably my boss' boss' boss, the one who could buy and sell me tenfold now.\n\nBut I am still Asian and here I am again, actually a couple of times with Jamie W. who had never been before. Our first time back wasn't bad as we had cocktails at the bar on a particularly empty evening. He had a $12 Walking Dead, a foreboding name for a reasonably subtle mix of Brugal Anejo rum, Appleton V/X, cinnamon, grenadine, grapefruit and absinthe (photo: http://bit.ly/1xOq2YJ). Mine was the more cosmo-oriented $11 Gazebo, a tropical blend of Hangar One vodka, Thai basil and pineapple (photo: http://bit.ly/1FCWliN). Cheers. Several months later, in the midst of the SantaCon stampede, we were willing to go anywhere to avoid the red-suited hipsters. We ducked in here for a light lunch and got seated next to a cackling hen party in the back.\n\nBecause I am still such a petite cherry blossom, I first ordered a Blushing Geisha, a refreshing mix of El Jimador tequila, sake and prickly pear (photo: http://bit.ly/1sh1gjq).

As a sucker for deviled eggs, I went for a pair of the Lapsang Souchong Tea Deviled Eggs at $2.25 a piece (photo: http://bit.ly/1AWuOVk).

Even though they looked overseasoned, it was probably the best of the appetizers we ordered. The last dish we shared as the $13 Roasted Squash & Kale Salad, which was pretty good mixed with goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, and toasted pumpkin seeds, all of it doused in a curried yogurt dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1AAi70Y). Too bad I had it a couple of days after eating Trick Dog's outstanding kale salad which had the benefit of avocado chunks for four dollars less.

For first timers, the pu pu platter is a great way to try out an assortment of items on the menu or simply to share among a group. My favorite HH food items are the dumplings, corn fritter bites, tuna tartare, and ribs. Skip the $1 oysters.

My parents were staying in Union Square and the wife was going to meet up after work from BART, so I was looking for a good Asian restaurant within easy walking distance for all parties.  I love SF but I drive around SF only as a last resort - high stress driving!\n\nE & O looks like a sleek, modern lounge with an open bar in the front with a large dining area in the back with open kitchen.  Nice aroma from their wood-fired ovens!  The menu is pretty creative with the flavors of SE Asia, India, and Japan and Korea.  In terms of food, all dishes we ordered exceeded our expectations - so five star endorsement for me!\n\nCocktails included the Moscow Mule (refreshing alcoholic ginger beer) and the Chili-Tamarindo Margarita.  Both were good, but the Mule was my favorite.\n\nIndonesia Corn Fritters are a must - They arrived hot and crispy and the two pieces easily accommodated the four of us.  With the dipping sauce, I got that nice one-two punch of sweet followed by heat.  The crispiness of these fritters was unreal.\n\nButternut Squash Dumplings - Very good.  We liked the firm dumpling skin and the rich butternut squash filling in the inside and the lighter curry sauce in the outside.\n\nShort Rib Sliders with Taro Chips - Dad got these from the Apps menu.  Three sliders with perfectly cooked and juicy short ribs.  Shredded taro chips were good too.  I managed to get half of one slider.\n\nSteelhead - Their salmon was cooked perfectly - skin-on, moist, and full of flavor from the mild sweet-sour broth.  I liked the balance of more butternut squash (or was it yams?) and green veggies.  Salmon is extremely hard to cook well but E&O aced this one.\n\nBlack Cod - Mom and wife both got this and absolutely loved it.  A good-sized piece of fish on a bed of water spinach.  The fish was also moist and juicy, and reminds us of the butterfish at Roy's which had a miso-soy-mirin glaze.  E&O's version seemed more balanced - not as rich or sweet.  I think it's actually better.\n\nSides - We got eggplant and tofu (Thai-inspired) and Kennebec Fries, which came out piping hot and crispy with some sort of unique seasoning (Japanese Togarashi?)\n\nDesserts - We shared Bananamisu and Mango Panna Cotta and had some disagreement.  Both were wonderful but I liked the panna cotta better with its creamy tart taste with some crunchiness (nuts perhaps?).  Everybody else liked the Bananamisu - which looked like a Tiramisu but with a banana cake and less creamy and rich than the traditional Italian version.\n\nWould definitely recommend coming here - I was lucky to have a small group come so that we sampled a few dishes from their dinner menu.

They are good and a better bang for your buck than some of the other appetizers, but almost any thing deep-fried is good.\n\nCod with Water Spinach ($27) - I love a nicely cooked miso glazed cod, but for $27 it was a little bit lackluster.

They come with thinly-sliced taro chips which are very delicious (not your average potato chips!) but kind of hard to pick up. (There's 3 of them and they're really cute! Unfortunately, that also means they're kind of tiny... )\n- Butternut Squash Dumplings: These were very good - soft and chewy with sweet butternut squash filling.

There was some discussion about what kind they were, evidently not what was normally available, but my oyster-loving friends said they were perhaps the best they'd ever tasted anywhere. For entrees, we split the dry rubbed chicken and the black cod. Both were beyond awesome. For dessert, we all shared a tiny little mango panna cotta, and I wish I'd had one the size of a watermelon.

Very good recommendation!\nA party of 6 for our girlfriends birthday, we decided to do it family style. Passing by on Sutter Street, the restaurant blends in very much to its surroundings. Floor to wall windows shows you inside to a long table where you can see customers eating the Asian Cuisine of E&O Asian Kitchen. Step inside to a dim lit setting, with wooden architecture surroundings. The hostess had a reservation for 3 but she easily was able to accommodate 6 of us. We had the long table in the front window, a perfect spot to people watch. \nFor starters, the scallion fried bread with the sauce was amazing. Served warm, it felt more like an Indian dish than an Asian dish, but very good non the less. The corn fritters that are fried, I didn't take much of a liking too. The butternut squash dumplings were one of my favorites. I wish more than a few came on a plate. Amazing. The sauce was good, I thought maybe it needed something more. \nThe beef short rib sliders are very savory. Served with a  side of taro chips, it was a very good balance, very refreshing and just enough room. The chicken lettuce cups we ordered as well. Those are the same as other lettuce cups, nothing special, but fresh- like any other Asian cuisine it would be served in. Now, the black pepper shaking beef was the best dish we ordered on the menu. The meat was cooked just right. Matched perfectly with the side of green beans which were also cooked perfectly and a small side of rice, we gushed over how good it was. It must be good if everyone at the table agrees.\nThe Asian \"Gnocchi\" rice sticks, natural beef filet, cabbage and spicy soy bean sauce was good. The sticks were filling. The Japanese \"Bop\" of crispy dashi kokuho rose rice, spinach, pickles, red chili furkake, bonito flakes with an egg sunny side up on top, was the most Asian dish I had tried there. A perfect fusion, it reminded me of Japan. \nTo celebrate with the birthday girl who is a light drinker, she chose the Dragon's Kiss. Sparkling wine, aperol bitter, blackberry shrub and lemon, perfect and sweet for a darling who loves alcohol you cannot taste. Bubbly. \nAnd to end her birthday, the Devils Food Cake with salted caramel was just the right size for her and made again amazing. Now one of my favorite desserts in the city. \nThe server was ok, nothing to emotionally engage us. She must have been busy. The hostess was gracious.

Couldn't take more than two bites of this.  My friend who ordered did not like it at all.  For me it was bearable, but I would never get this again.  Had a funny taste to it.  \n\nIf you want rice, you have to order that as a side.....really?? You can't just include your dishes with rice?  Um, no thank you.

I tend to not think of Asian food when it comes to gluten-free dining so I was glad to be introduced to this restaurant. Right away I was very impressed even just upon entering. The interior design is amazing cloaked in warm inviting earth tones.\n\nMy daughter, Ashlee, home from college, joined me for lunch. Presented with our gluten-free menus (I love it when a restaurant has a specific gluten-free menu), it was hard to choose there are so many GF options. We opted to begin with the shrimp satay served with basil mango dipping sauce. It was lovely. I am so used to simple eating that it was a delight savoring all the unique flavors I do not get to experience at home. I enjoyed the lightly pickled veggies as well as the perfectly prepared shrimp. The dish was very creative.\n\nI just had to try the E&O wood grilled hamburger with brown rice flour sesame bun with sriracha aioli, green papaya salad, white cheddar and fried egg. I asked them to hold the cheese and egg since I can't do cow's milk or egg. As it turns out, the gluten-free bun is Canyon Bakehouse which just happens to be my favorite hamburger bun. Oh, joy! It was delicious and a treat to enjoy a hamburger with a bun out on the town.\n\nI could see right away the awesome quality of the burger. It is so hard to find a good burger these days. My meal was delightful.\n\nMy daughter opted for the Indonesian fried rice with gulf white prawns, char siu pork, vegetables, egg and chilies. She was very impressed. This this was way out of the box for her so the fact that she liked it is a solid testimony.\n\nFor dessert, our only option was the sorbet but, wow, what a sorbet selection. There were three options: coconut pandan (Asian grass with a vanilla flavor), grapefruit and mango/passion-fruit. The flavors were very exotic. I was very impressed and pleased.\n\nWhen asked about cross contamination procedures, the chef, Sharon Nahm, came to our table and assured as that precautions are taken to avoid gluten contamination including proper equipment procedures and hand washing. Of course one never has a guarantee but I felt confident (and safe) after talking to her.\n\nWe had a lovely experience at E&O Asian Kitchen and would love to go back.

We had the long table in the front window, a perfect spot to people watch. \nFor starters, the scallion fried bread with the sauce was amazing. Served warm, it felt more like an Indian dish than an Asian dish, but very good non the less. The corn fritters that are fried, I didn't take much of a liking too. The butternut squash dumplings were one of my favorites. I wish more than a few came on a plate. Amazing. The sauce was good, I thought maybe it needed something more. \nThe beef short rib sliders are very savory. Served with a  side of taro chips, it was a very good balance, very refreshing and just enough room. The chicken lettuce cups we ordered as well. Those are the same as other lettuce cups, nothing special, but fresh- like any other Asian cuisine it would be served in. Now, the black pepper shaking beef was the best dish we ordered on the menu.

Food was decent and usually on the lighter side for dinner (or maybe we coincidentally picked lighter dishes).\n-- HH Oysters ($1 per oyster) - very fresh and briny, though on a smaller side (as expected from a happy hour)\n\n-- HH Dumplings (butternut squash and red curry sauce)($1 each)- butternut squash flavor comes out very nicely and red curry sauce didn't overpower it.  Has a creamy texture in terms of mouthfeel, so definitely different from your typical Asian dumpling\n\n-- Japanese \"Bop\" (crispy dashi rice, sunny side farm egg, spinach, pickles, red chili furikake, bonito flakes, umeboshi plum)($17) - interesting take on crispy rice, with the egg adding richness and the pickles add some acidity.  The rice was a bit too crispy at times, making it super hard to cut through.  \n\n-- Prawn Salad (gulf white prawns, cucumber, asian fruits, cashews, onions, fresh chilies, thai basil, mint, cilantro, lemon oil, maldon salt)($18) - interesting, fruit forward salad.  Definitely a lot of fruit but enough shrimp to satisfy our protein craving.  Luckily it doesn't eat super sweet with the lemon, fresh herbs, cucumber and chilies.  It is a rather large portion- my friend and I had a bit of trouble sharing it just between the two of us.  \n\n-- Wood Roasted Char Siu Black Cod (sauteed water spinach)($27) - highlight of the meal!  The char siu flavoring worked surprisingly well with the black cod- sweet but slightly tangy.  The cod was well cooked and flaky.  Also a big fan of the sauteed spinach since they were not too oily!\n\nDinner came out to around $30 per person excluding drinks.

In terms of food, all dishes we ordered exceeded our expectations - so five star endorsement for me!\n\nCocktails included the Moscow Mule (refreshing alcoholic ginger beer) and the Chili-Tamarindo Margarita.  Both were good, but the Mule was my favorite.\n\nIndonesia Corn Fritters are a must - They arrived hot and crispy and the two pieces easily accommodated the four of us.  With the dipping sauce, I got that nice one-two punch of sweet followed by heat.  The crispiness of these fritters was unreal.\n\nButternut Squash Dumplings - Very good.  We liked the firm dumpling skin and the rich butternut squash filling in the inside and the lighter curry sauce in the outside.\n\nShort Rib Sliders with Taro Chips - Dad got these from the Apps menu.  Three sliders with perfectly cooked and juicy short ribs.  Shredded taro chips were good too.  I managed to get half of one slider.\n\nSteelhead - Their salmon was cooked perfectly - skin-on, moist, and full of flavor from the mild sweet-sour broth.  I liked the balance of more butternut squash (or was it yams?) and green veggies.  Salmon is extremely hard to cook well but E&O aced this one.\n\nBlack Cod - Mom and wife both got this and absolutely loved it.  A good-sized piece of fish on a bed of water spinach.  The fish was also moist and juicy, and reminds us of the butterfish at Roy's which had a miso-soy-mirin glaze.  E&O's version seemed more balanced - not as rich or sweet.  I think it's actually better.\n\nSides - We got eggplant and tofu (Thai-inspired) and Kennebec Fries, which came out piping hot and crispy with some sort of unique seasoning (Japanese Togarashi?)\n\nDesserts - We shared Bananamisu and Mango Panna Cotta and had some disagreement.  Both were wonderful but I liked the panna cotta better with its creamy tart taste with some crunchiness (nuts perhaps?).  Everybody else liked the Bananamisu - which looked like a Tiramisu but with a banana cake and less creamy and rich than the traditional Italian version.\n\nWould definitely recommend coming here - I was lucky to have a small group come so that we sampled a few dishes from their dinner menu.

"], "author": "Christina L.", "review": "This place reminds me of PF Chang's, but more expensive and probably catered towards tourists since it's in Union Square, and business travelers. With higher price points, it's fine if you're expensing your meal to your company, but I probably wouldn't come back, given other options for Asian food, and Asian fusion in San Francisco. I guess it's good for big groups and tourists, but there are far better places out in the city that you're missing out on if you eat here!\n\nChicken Satay ($13) - They at least use free-range chicken, but this is expensive for what it is. I've had similar chicken satay at Thai restaurants for half the price. Get this if you really are craving chicken satay, but I'd pass on this and save it for the next time you go to a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant.\n\nButternut Squash Dumplings ($13) - These are a bit pricey for dumplings, since you get 6 of them for $13. If you're really craving dumplings, go to a place that specialized in dumplings in the Outer Sunset. But if you're craving dumplings and willing to pay a little bit more, then these are fine. The sweet butternut squash filling makes it taste like a butternut squash ravioli, and almost a little bit on the dessert side since it's sweet. Good, but not amazing.\n\nIndonesian Corn Fritters ($9) - As if you couldn't tell by the name, these are pieces of corn, held together by batter and deep fried into small-burger-sized patties. If you don't like food with spices or cumin, it's best to avoid these. They are good and a better bang for your buck than some of the other appetizers, but almost any thing deep-fried is good.\n\nCod with Water Spinach ($27) - I love a nicely cooked miso glazed cod, but for $27 it was a little bit lackluster. It seemed like they just saut\u00e9ed spinach in a pan and threw a small piece of fish on it. It wasn't bad, but not worth $27.  It's similar to PF Chang's cod, but at a more expensive price. I was hungry when I finished my entr\u00e9e.\n\nIf you're not paying out of your own pocket, this is a fine place to go if you're looking for somewhere to seat a big party, or you're traveling, staying in Union Square and want something close by.

I liked the curry sauce that came with it. \n\nChicken satay: tender pieces of chicken. Probably the best thing of the whole meal. Then again, it is just chicken.\n\nDrunken noodle: I had way better for less than half the price. It is way over salted. Tastes like someone tipped over the fish sauce bottle. This dish had a lot of end pieces of Chinese broccoli with tough outer skin. Quite often it's as if we were eating wood shavings. Dish also had a lot of cilantro in it (which is not listed on the menu) and almost no basil (which is listed on the menu). We would've asked to skipped the cilantro because my husband doesn't care for the taste. But there's no way for us to find out. \n\nWater spinach side: Thank god this is kinda bland, so I can mix it with the overly salty drunken noodle and get something a little better. \n\nOur waitress did seem very knowledgeable with the menu. When we tried to figure out what water spinach is, she couldn't offer anything other than \"it's like spinach with smaller leaves.\" Well, the hollow stem should've been it's defining feature.
