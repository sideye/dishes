This dish is definitely not worth the caloric intake nor is it worth your money. They only put the tasty green onion mixture in the middle of the pancake and it only covered approximately 25% of the pancake innards. Therefore, when they fry it up and serve it to you, you eat mostly fried batter without the yummy insides.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings: Not bad. I am a huge chicken wing enthusiast, especially salt and pepper wings, so I may be a bit critical when it comes to this dish. I've definitely had much tastier salt and pepper wings, but it isn't the worst I've had. It's fairly average and I would order it again if ordering from this place.\n\nChicken Chow Fun: Meh. Honestly, I don't think there was enough soy or sauce on it because the noodles were not brown but a tan color, which is an indication that there isn't enough soy. When tasting, it was a bit bland for what the dish could have been. I would skip this dish or maybe try the beef chow fun next time.\n\nBok Choy and Shiitake mushrooms: It's hard to ruin this dish so this dish gets my thumbs up especially if you're trying to eat healthy.\n\nWor Won Ton Soup: The broth was a bit plain and everything in it was just meh. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. \n\n\nIn conclusion: just a \"meh\" restaurant. If I am craving Chinese, I might order from here again but I'd probably be more inclined to trying another place just because their food is just average. I'm not really sure why they have such a high rating. Is it the neighborhood they are in? If they were in the sunset or a more Chinese populated neighborhood, I have a feeling they wouldn't have such a high rating.

When you order two entrees, you get a free FULL-SIZED order of fried rice or chow mein. Nice! Barbecued pork chow mein for me, please.\n\nThe food arrived, nice and hot, in about 30 minutes. The wontons blew me away...they were simply amazing. Cream cheese, scallions and real crab enveloped in a crispy fried wonton skin.\n\nThe chow mein was simple and satisfying.\n\nThe orange beef wasn't as good as Hunan Homes', but I liked that the breading wasn't too thick and that the chiles were ground up and distributed throughout the dish rather than thrown in whole.\n\nThe walnut prawns, again, weren't as good as Hunan Homes', but I would order them again. They give you a baker's dozen, by the way.\n\nI expected the prawns to come on the usual bed of shredded lettuce, but the beef was served that way as well, which I don't care for because it reheats horribly. Next time I'll ask them to leave out the lettuce on everything so that I don't have to pick it off.\n\nSo, all told, for about $30 including tip, I got almost 5 meals.

Me: sweet and sour chicken. Him: Mongolian beef. We also split an order of vegetable egg rolls. Hot tea was complimentary, and the ice water was slightly lemon flavored.\n\nHere's what sold me on this place for a 4-star review...\n\nYou know when you order an appetizer for two people, but it comes served in an odd number (in our case, three egg rolls for two people)? It is always weird when you get down to remaining rolls. \"Oh, you can have it.\" \"No, you have it!\" \"No you, I insist!\"\n\nWhether this was on purpose or not, I don't know, but the Yum Yum staff cut our egg rolls in half--essentially leaving us with six mini-egg rolls.

The delivery time was standard, about 40 minutes. The food came warm which is always a plus in my book.\n\nFOOD:\nGreen onion pancake: SKIP! This dish is definitely not worth the caloric intake nor is it worth your money. They only put the tasty green onion mixture in the middle of the pancake and it only covered approximately 25% of the pancake innards. Therefore, when they fry it up and serve it to you, you eat mostly fried batter without the yummy insides.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings: Not bad. I am a huge chicken wing enthusiast, especially salt and pepper wings, so I may be a bit critical when it comes to this dish. I've definitely had much tastier salt and pepper wings, but it isn't the worst I've had. It's fairly average and I would order it again if ordering from this place.\n\nChicken Chow Fun: Meh. Honestly, I don't think there was enough soy or sauce on it because the noodles were not brown but a tan color, which is an indication that there isn't enough soy. When tasting, it was a bit bland for what the dish could have been. I would skip this dish or maybe try the beef chow fun next time.\n\nBok Choy and Shiitake mushrooms: It's hard to ruin this dish so this dish gets my thumbs up especially if you're trying to eat healthy.\n\nWor Won Ton Soup: The broth was a bit plain and everything in it was just meh. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. \n\n\nIn conclusion: just a \"meh\" restaurant. If I am craving Chinese, I might order from here again but I'd probably be more inclined to trying another place just because their food is just average. I'm not really sure why they have such a high rating. Is it the neighborhood they are in? If they were in the sunset or a more Chinese populated neighborhood, I have a feeling they wouldn't have such a high rating.

It has some lovely things that I would never have ordered were it not for the reviews on this site, and then it had some things that I craved which were also mentioned on this site.  Let's start off with the good news, shall we?\n\nCrab Rangoon - 5 stars, delicious, star shaped generous filling.  I would never have order this except one of the reviews here talked about it and I am very very glad I did.  It's a good execution of Crab Rangoon even if it may be crab-less.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings Entree - 5 Stars.  Came on a bed of shredded lettuce with jalapeno, peppers, some other stuff.  Batter was tasty and seasoned.  A bit heavy, but that's like saying the cone shape of carrots detracts from the taste.  \n\nMa Po ToFu - 3 stars.  Ths sauce was not undelicious, and the flavor was not offensive.  My preferance is for it to be made with soft tofu whereas this was made with medium or firm.\n\nBuddha's Delight Vegetable Clay Pot - 3 stars.  The taste was rather fresh.  I enjoyed the thin glass noodles at the bottom and the pleasing array of veg, wood ear mushroom, and tofu.  Again, I would have like soft tofu, not medium or firm.  \n\nPork Chow Mein - 5 stars because it was FREE!!  I ordered so much food that my tummy is groaning right now.  Maybe tomorrow after the laxative eat works its magic, I'll have some.  But for now, Chinese food:1, Christina:0.\n\nLet's talk about the lovely young man who delivered it.  He was so considerate and concerned that my apartment door would close and lock me out (it does and did), he voiced his concern.  Ah.  What a nice young man.\n\nFinal thoughts: I've come to the conclusion that ordering chinese food as a chinese person who does not live in NYC is like eating at a cafeteria (maybe even a public school cafeteria) after having grown up on home cooking, on the farm, grandmother makes her own bread, cooks her own jellies.  I'm not disappointed because that would be like being disappointed that watermelons are not poisonous.  I am merely...enlightened.

They give you a baker's dozen, by the way.\n\nI expected the prawns to come on the usual bed of shredded lettuce, but the beef was served that way as well, which I don't care for because it reheats horribly.

Tell Chef Yum Yum to try PF Changs \"Changs Chicken\", or even Panda Express! Something a little more sticky, less water, and less deep friend - or change the deep fry recipe to include a sticky sauce mixture like bbq ribs.  I've had alot of General Chicken in my life and this was the worst, I'm not angry, just disappointed.

Broccoli has been well cooked every time, except once when it was a bit overdone, but still pretty good. Also, tasty.\nBrown rice: Too often restaurant undercook brown rice thinking it cooks like white rice. Yum Yum gets it right. Simply steamed.\nVeggie Potstickers: Like the others, comes hot, tastes fresh. Good by themselves, without any extra sauce. Although I do like to rub the last one in the General Tsao's sauce once the take-out thing is empty.\nSpeed: 20-40 minutes. Again, I order when they just start delivery, so there's no back-up from a bunch of other people ordering unless they're just like me.\nService: Always nice on the phone, never had to be on hold. The delivery guy is always nice, and always has change.\nPrice: With tip, I think we pay $19 for this meal for two.

Cream cheese, scallions and real crab enveloped in a crispy fried wonton skin.\n\nThe chow mein was simple and satisfying.\n\nThe orange beef wasn't as good as Hunan Homes', but I liked that the breading wasn't too thick and that the chiles were ground up and distributed throughout the dish rather than thrown in whole.\n\nThe walnut prawns, again, weren't as good as Hunan Homes', but I would order them again. They give you a baker's dozen, by the way.\n\nI expected the prawns to come on the usual bed of shredded lettuce, but the beef was served that way as well, which I don't care for because it reheats horribly. Next time I'll ask them to leave out the lettuce on everything so that I don't have to pick it off.\n\nSo, all told, for about $30 including tip, I got almost 5 meals.

But the real surprise/treat of the night was the Spicy Garlic Eggplant; usually when you order this dish at a Chinese restaurant it's usually bland and you don't really taste \"garlic\" or \"spicy,\" but YYH's was full of flavor and the best part: their spicy garlic eggplant comes with shrimp, calamari and other assorted SEAFOOD!

I would never have order this except one of the reviews here talked about it and I am very very glad I did.  It's a good execution of Crab Rangoon even if it may be crab-less.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings Entree - 5 Stars.  Came on a bed of shredded lettuce with jalapeno, peppers, some other stuff.  Batter was tasty and seasoned.  A bit heavy, but that's like saying the cone shape of carrots detracts from the taste.  \n\nMa Po ToFu - 3 stars.  Ths sauce was not undelicious, and the flavor was not offensive.  My preferance is for it to be made with soft tofu whereas this was made with medium or firm.\n\nBuddha's Delight Vegetable Clay Pot - 3 stars.  The taste was rather fresh.  I enjoyed the thin glass noodles at the bottom and the pleasing array of veg, wood ear mushroom, and tofu.  Again, I would have like soft tofu, not medium or firm.  \n\nPork Chow Mein - 5 stars because it was FREE!!  I ordered so much food that my tummy is groaning right now.

This dish is definitely not worth the caloric intake nor is it worth your money. They only put the tasty green onion mixture in the middle of the pancake and it only covered approximately 25% of the pancake innards. Therefore, when they fry it up and serve it to you, you eat mostly fried batter without the yummy insides.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings: Not bad. I am a huge chicken wing enthusiast, especially salt and pepper wings, so I may be a bit critical when it comes to this dish. I've definitely had much tastier salt and pepper wings, but it isn't the worst I've had. It's fairly average and I would order it again if ordering from this place.\n\nChicken Chow Fun: Meh.

Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. \n\n\nIn conclusion: just a \"meh\" restaurant. If I am craving Chinese, I might order from here again but I'd probably be more inclined to trying another place just because their food is just average.
