The place was fairly full with most tables taken (though the bar area was mostly empty). Service from the wait staff seemed a bit inconsistent - some of the staff were a bit rushed and impatient with us, but the rest were attentive and courteous (at one point, we ordered a pot of chai that we didn't finish and it went cold; they actually gave us another full pot of chai free of charge!), so I'll call it \"mostly positive\".\n\nWe ordered 5 things:\n- Crispy potato turnovers: a bit dry, not particularly well-seasoned, the sauces were a must to wash it down. Not impressed.\n- A chaat with mini samosas and sev and other things (whose name I forgot): we all thought it was excellent, full of flavor, the tang from the tamarind and yogurt, the heat, the refreshing cilantro, it was a well-executed chaat.\n- Gosht karma pulao: though I'm not knowledgeable enough about Indian cuisine to say if it was a pulao or a biryani, suffice to say it was delicious - the lamb was tender, the rice was well-seasoned, the accompanying raita did not miss a beat.

It was met with high approval all around the table and was the only thing we completely finished at the table that night.\n- Dal tadka: seems to be what you'd expect from dal tadka... again, the hing did add a nice undertone of a flavor, but it was pretty standard otherwise.\n\nActually, we ordered more than 5 things: the rice had to be ordered separately. Paying $4.25 for a bowl of rice, if you ask me, is a bit of a rip off, especially when a dal tadka already costs $18. I guess you pay for the ambiance and the location in the Financial District...\n\nOverall, we thought the food was quite good with almost everything meeting or slightly exceeding our expectations, the service was very good, and the vibe was great - lively but classy. My only complaints would be the somewhat inconsistent service from different waiters/waitresses and overall somewhat high price for the food, but given the location, it is mostly understandable - but, seriously, include the rice in your dishes!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-12"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with the Crispy Potato Turnovers (Savory Potato Parcels, Garbanzo Stew, Trio of Sauces), and they were off-the-charts delicious.

My husband and I made reservations (Open Table) in June for dinner on 8/5/16 (Friday). Our reservations were for 8 pm and we arrived 30 minutes early. On a weekend night, don't expect to be seated before your reservation time. We were told to wait at the bar until 8PM. You can take the chance and walk in w/o a reservation and sit in the bar area and order food. However, with the appetizers, bread, soup, and entrees, there would not be enough room at the mini tables. \n\nMy husband and I were taken to a corner booth which was perfect, best seat in the restaurant for two. We were given an expansive wine menu to look at on the IPad. Since I was driving, I opted out but my husband ordered the Liberty Ale (on tap). We ordered the bread basket for starters which comes with three types of bread: Spinach Roti, Laccha Paratha, and Naan. This is more of an appetizer for 3-4 people, so we had to take some to go. The Laccha Paratha was my favorite because it had some jerk spice that made it flavorful. We tried the crispy potato turnovers because they were new to the menu and this dish was amazing. The garbanzo stew made this dish. The turnovers for this appetizer are tiny, but the dish is worth trying. My husband and I also split the tomato soup. It was delicious and my husband said it was easily in the top 5 best tomato soups he has ever had. The tandoori flavor really shined through in the soup and was unlike any tomato soup I have tasted. \n\nFor the main course I had the Lobster Cream Coconut curry and it came with an empty lobster shell on top for presentation. It was delicious and tasted similar to a vegetarian Korma but still different. It was nice to see fresh chunks of lobster tail in my dish. My husband ordered the Lamb Korma and he said his was very good, but my dish reigned supreme. We ordered the saffron rice to go with the curries because it is not included like it is in some Indian restaurants. \nThis restaurant has good size portions. Keep that in mind when ordering. My husband and I run everyday and we had a huge appetite during dinner which is why we decided to order dessert. We split the mango cr\u00e8me brulee and it was divine; the perfect ending to a wonderful date.\n\nAlso, for the reviews that mentioned noise: Yes, it is noisy in the restaurant and tables are close together. However, all the ethnic restaurants that I have been to in SF have close proximity seating (Mamacita, Ler Ros, Sheba, Foreign Cinema, Slanted Door, etc).\n\nAtmosphere 5*\nPrice 5*\nLocation 5*\nFood/Taste 5*\nService 5*", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the crispy potato turnovers and it was off the hook.

People here are usually fidi types or at least nice, but not formal. Classy. Although we did come here a few years ago with our Halloween costumes and they didn't turn us away.\n\nFood: \nI've gotten their lunch buffet, which all of it is flavorful and wonderfully spiced. Their prices are fair for what you're getting, which are high quality dishes.\n\nAs far as dinner, I've ordered the scallops prepared in a number of ways depending on the season. They're all excellent. Seared and soft, but not chewy, they're cooked to perfection. I always get two orders of papad because I love them. (Even though they have three pieces per order, I manage to devour then all.) \n\nThe sampler tandoori platter is also delicious, but the meat was drier than my personal tastes. The spices totally make up for the dryness to a point. I'm more of a rare steak kinda gal, so take that recommendation however you like. \n\nWe always get the cauliflower bezule because it's vegan. Don't let that fool you - it's delicious. We even ate the dried candied orange and was inspired to make our own from the dehydrator, but I digress.\n\nThe okra with dried mango powder is also wonderful for vegans and omnivores alike. It's not slimy, but retains the okra flavor. The dried mango powder is impressive and well spiced. \n\nThe jalapeno dish is always wonderful and spicy if you're into that. The eggplant isn't mushy and it's a whole Indian eggplant, roasted. It's delicious. I've also tried various lamb dishes here and if you like lamb definitely give it a go.\n\nThe drinks are unique and their mocktails -Amber blush- would also be recommended.\n\nService:\nThe times I've been here I'd say the service is on the slower side, but on par with other fine dining with a more relaxed atmosphere.

Two restaurants stand out in my mind - one is Dosa, and the other is Amber. \n\nIn short, Amber does traditional (north) indian food incredibly well. Add a dose of upscale dining, a great downtown location, and great service and you're in for an amazing night. \n\nThe restaurant is huge, yet at any given night, I've seen Amber nearly full, which speaks to its popularity and delicious food. So delicious that I went once 3 days in a row, absolutely unintentionally, and the waitress recognized me. \n\nYes, it was slightly embarrassing. Yes, I pigged out at the awesome buffet. (They have this 7 days a week)\n\nAlright. Cutting to the food review. The dishes I've had - \n\nAppetizers\n1. English Peas, Portobello, & Goat Cheese Tikki - yummy patties with the aforementioned ingredients fried to delicious goodness. Give it a try!\n2. Aloo Peas Samosas - good. Nothing extraordinary. It's samosas. Ok alright, it's not greasy. Thank god for little miracles.\n3. Chicken Apricot Kebab - great combo of chicken and apricot! loved it.\n\nEntrees\n1. Butter Chicken - this is their signature. And they do it, very, VERY well. Go for it. \n2. Sea Bass Kokum Curry - so so great. Amazing fish dish and the coconut milk adds a ton to it.\n3. Paneer Lababdar - basically take what you had in the butter chicken and remove the chicken, and add paneer. Ladies and gents, we have paneer lababdar. Good stuff.\n4. Badam Bhara Baingan - OMG. Favorite dish on the menu. Hands down. Try it. Eggplant, caramelized onions, and almond PERFECTION.\n5. Lahsooni Saag Paneer - your typical great saag panneer.\n\nAnd of course, the tandoori rotis, the rice, the raita....all of it phenom.\n\nLastly, desserts - they're all pretty mediocre IMO compared to the rest of the menu. And come what may, please never try the Falooda with Strawberry ice cream. \n\nGo on, give it a try. It won't disappoint. It's definitely more expensive than many other indian restaurants out there, but it offers a variety that is consistently amazing with an absolutely awesome setting. \n\nHowever just in case you're still skeptical, definitely give the lunch buffet a try and try many of their different dishes for a great price.

Now I don't want to say that this is legit Indian food (heck, I wouldn't know) but they know what they do well and they stick to it. Amber's food is a bit Americanized but like I said, it's GOOD and I'm glad they keep at it.\n\nWhat I had:\n1) Aloo Peas Samosas -- potatoes were spiced just right! I usually am a pansy when it comes to spicy food but these samosas had a good 'kick' to them and the sauces that came with it were superb. \n\n2) Butter Chicken with Tandoori Naan and Saffron Rice -- MY FAVORITE. The Butter Chicken was tender and drenched in a rich, buttery, tomato sauce. Each bite I took with the saffron rice (which was, by the way, cooked just right and wonderfully fragrant on its own) was heavenly goodness. As if this wasn't satisfying enough, I used the crispy naan to dip whatever was left of the buttery tomato sauce. YUM.\n\n3) Badam Bhara Baingan -- normally I don't like vegetarian dishes because I feel that too many spices are thrown in to make up for the lack of fat and flavor that comes from meat... but this eggplant dish was great. The eggplant drew a lot of flavor from the caramelized onions (which I love) and I think that was it. There were no add-on complex spices, just simple and savory. The caramelized eggplant and onion complemented the saffron rice so well.\n\n4) Jaipuri Bhindi -- okra dish cooked with tomato and green mango. Wow. It was dee-lish to say the least. It was perfectly seasoned and it had a bit of crisp on the shell of the okra, which gave it a nice texture (I'm used to steaming okra, which makes it soft and gooey). Loved this dish as well! \n\n5) Mango Brulee -- okay, I LOVE anything mango so I might be biased... this creme brulee was sublime. The custard tasted like mango lassi -- sweet, fruity, with a bit of tang -- and, of course, the caramelized top layer provided for a nice crunch with the soft custard. I would definitely recommend this.\n\n6) \"Bru\" Coffee Kulfi with Chocolate Sauce -- I don't like the taste of coffee but this frozen dessert was great... especially when doused in rich chocolate sauce. The combination was sweet! I think I'd stick with the Mango Brulee for dessert, though. \n\nI liked that they had a section for meat-eaters and vegetarians. Both had great dishes to choose from and all that I've tried were delectable. Amber has a great ambiance -- perfect for a romantic date -- and the service is quick.

We made a reservation in advance for 8:00pm and when we arrived we waited a bit for our table and were seated immediately. When we sat we were given menus but not the DAT menu. We had to wait about 10 or so minutes later for a server because it was clear they were a little under staffed. When we finally got a hold of someone to ask for the menu they came and brought out the wrong menu. More time passed and we had to wait to ask for the right menu again. After a while we were finally presented with the correct menu. I dislike the fact that they don't offer the DAT menu when you first sit down. It's like if you came to the restaurant without knowing about DAT, you would not get the menu and I think they do it on purpose to deter people from getting such a great deal. Every other restaurant that participates will offer the DAT menu as an option right away or only have the DAT menu for dinner for the week that it goes on. So Minus a star for the difficulty in getting a menu. We were also asked to move to a different table and it wasn't a big deal since we hadn't ordered anything yet but I mean they should know who is reserved and how to set up their dinning room tables, that's a managerial hick up.\n\nThe review is not tarnished however because the food made up for it. When you order you get an appetizer, two entrees, a choice of rice and naan and dessert. You get so much more here than you would get at a Italian or American style restaurant also participating in DAT. We enjoyed the menu because it's more expansive and the options they provide were intriguing. \n\nFor apps we ordered a lamb and duck kabob. The duck was forgettable but the lamb was flavored well and we enjoyed the sauces that it came with. For main entrees I ordered the goat curry and my girlfriend ordered the butter chicken. Our choice of rice was brown and lentils. Our choice of naan was garlic naan and chili thyme naan. Hands down the greatest butter chicken I have tasted in my life. It was life changing and may have ruined all Indian food for me in the future. The goat curry was nice but the butter chicken was the star and I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I was surprised the brown rice was cooked so well and went with the lentils and curries magnificently, it was better than most basmati rice I've had at Indian places. The lentils also had good flavor that paired well with our rice and naans. The garlic naan is your standard garlic naan, but the chili thyme naan was on point with a little spice and flavor was excellent with butter chicken. Definitely worth it for Dine about town.\n\nFor dessert we got syrup dough balls which were very sweet and tangy. We also got mango creme brulee which is essentially mango lassi in a creme brulee and it totally worked. Very refreshing and it tasted magnificent. Overall our restaurant experience was awesome and our service was really friendly despite the DAT menu debacle at the beginning of our meal and being moved to a different table but honestly, the table we were moved too was much better.

First off, the place is gorgeous.  Comfy chairs to boot.  There weren't a lot of people there, so I was slightly worried about the food, because I'm a firm believer in packed restaurant = delicious food goodness. \n\nWe ended up ordering the duck kababs (I have to get used to kababs, since it's how they do things in the UK) as an appetizer, and two lamb dishes.  Lamb is my favorite food, and he likes it too, so we got the Kashmiri Roganjosh (one of his favorite dishes) and Shalgam Nalli (a braised lamb shank).  We also got a bottle of wine.  We also ordered chili thyme naan and lacha paratha.\n\nSo, the duck was amazing.  Super tender, and the sauce it came with we both wanted to eat with a spoon.  I don't know how they got it so tender and delicious, but I would recommend this dish to anyone who eats duck.  Both of the lamb dishes were also amazing.  Quite spicy and not dumbed down for American people, like many of the Indian restaurants I've been too.  The spice and the flavors were so close to the food I had in India, I was in heaven.  After one bite, my boyfriend said we were going back there again!  Both the breads were quite tasty, but I prefer paratha to naan in general.  \n\nAs they bring the dessert menus, I mention that if they have Galub Jamun, we're getting it.  I fell in love with them when I was in Kolkata, and since the dinner was fantastic, I was sure that they were going to do a great job of them as well.  Since they are indeed on the dessert menu, I ordered it.  There were two of them, which let both of us have a nice bite at the end of the meal, and he had never had them before.  He just loved it!  I did too.\n\nWe're definitely going back to this place.  The food was just amazing.  If you're a big fan of authentic Indian food, this is the place to go.

Urban, sleek, polished, multi-level with bar on top, polished tables. The food arrives piping hot in glistening brass vessels. We love getting their tandoori fish, either the salmon or sea bass, is phenomenal, super fresh and not overly cooked, left tender and flaky, with the juices and flavors seared into the flesh.The frontier kebab or tandoori rack of lamb (Frontier) and butter chicken dishes became our mantra :-) I kid you not: the tastes were a revelation, it was as if I had never eaten tandoori lamb or chicken tikka masala before. The flavors of their butter chicken are blended perfection, a waft of fenugreek as its set on the table, the sauce rich, creamy, tomatoey and though velvety, it's not greasy or oily--and a little goes a very long way! It has shredded chicken from the tandoori--I use a bit of garlic nan to barely dip into this curry and the flavor is explosive. Unlike those early days, I can no longer eat spicy food, and we asked them to make it \"mild,\" and they absolutely delivered! This is hard for an Indian restaurant to do, because they usually do not know how to tone down the spiciness by simply taking out the chili . . . but they did it beautifully, leaving all the flavor and complexity, the layering of spices, did not sacrifice any of this; I loved it! The remarkable thing about Amber is their consistency, over the years and from visit to visit: more than a decade ago, I wrote a Zagat review, likening a mouthful of their butter chicken to an orgasm. That curry should be patented. And to get that signature level of tenderness, the rack of lamb is likely marinated a minimum of overnight in improbable spices and god knows what else; this must be tasted to believe. I cannot do justice to it, it literally melts in your mouth and is not the slightest bit gamey.

You might call that a bias, but I would call it knowing what I'm talking about.  Amber India is a pretty restaurant, with a modern but comfy aesthetic.  The food, though, is about as boring as Indian food can be.  \n\nMost Indian restaurants in the US start with an authentic Indian recipe, and then they cut the flavor in half (for fear of offending sensitive western palates).  Amber cuts the flavor to about a measly quarter of where it ought to be.  And to be clear, I'm not talking about \"heat\"; I'm talking about flavor (Indian food, as a general rule, is not intended to be \"hot\").\n\nWe had:\n- Four-Chili Rubbed Sea Bass: The flavor was actually very good, but there just wasn't much of it.  The \"rub\" was apparently more of a gentle tap.  Very little of the flavors actually came through in the finished product.  Also, the fish was slightly undercooked.  And at $27, I was expecting more than 5 small pieces of fish.\n- Subj Korma: It is a common cheat, among western Indian restaurants, to subtract spices and other expensive ingredients, and then make up for it by adding butter or cream.  And that's precisely what they did here.  This was, without a doubt, the blandest Indian-style vegetable dish I've ever eaten anywhere.  And at $16, probably the most expensive as well.\n- Naan: It was good, but I suspect that if it were possible to subtract flavor from bread, they would have done so.  And $3.50 for a single serving?  That's crazy.\n- Zafran Khuska: fancy name for white rice with a few spices thrown in.  Pretty good, but a really skimpy serving for $3.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point...I just can't believe that I paid $70 for all of this bland food.

It was a pleasing meal but I would not label this restaurant as the best Indian spot in San Francisco. The portions were pretty average for a higher end restaurant such as Amber India. The chicken was flavorful, not too spicy, and very tender. The rice was pretty standard along with the naan and roti. The Cucumber Raita stood out the most to be, it was my favorite thing on the table. \n\nService:\nI was in between giving this place a 3 or a 4, mainly because of the service. If there's one thing that I value when eating out, it's exceptional customer service. Amber India provided that for me. Our server was very polite and attentive to our needs. The bussers were also super attentive. \n\nAtmosphere:\nAmber India has such a beautiful atmosphere, but again this is more of an upscale restaurant so it should. Not meaning to be entirely superficial, but one of the reasons why I wanted to check this place out was for their interior d\u00e9cor and design. It would be a good spot for a date; though to my surprise, there were lots of families with kids (found that a tad bit random since we were having dinner during prime time on a Saturday night). Nothing wrong with kids, just found it interesting to see so many families in a fairly upscale Downtown SF restaurant on a weekend night.

People here are usually fidi types or at least nice, but not formal. Classy. Although we did come here a few years ago with our Halloween costumes and they didn't turn us away.\n\nFood: \nI've gotten their lunch buffet, which all of it is flavorful and wonderfully spiced. Their prices are fair for what you're getting, which are high quality dishes.\n\nAs far as dinner, I've ordered the scallops prepared in a number of ways depending on the season. They're all excellent. Seared and soft, but not chewy, they're cooked to perfection. I always get two orders of papad because I love them. (Even though they have three pieces per order, I manage to devour then all.) \n\nThe sampler tandoori platter is also delicious, but the meat was drier than my personal tastes. The spices totally make up for the dryness to a point. I'm more of a rare steak kinda gal, so take that recommendation however you like. \n\nWe always get the cauliflower bezule because it's vegan. Don't let that fool you - it's delicious. We even ate the dried candied orange and was inspired to make our own from the dehydrator, but I digress.\n\nThe okra with dried mango powder is also wonderful for vegans and omnivores alike. It's not slimy, but retains the okra flavor. The dried mango powder is impressive and well spiced. \n\nThe jalapeno dish is always wonderful and spicy if you're into that. The eggplant isn't mushy and it's a whole Indian eggplant, roasted. It's delicious. I've also tried various lamb dishes here and if you like lamb definitely give it a go.\n\nThe drinks are unique and their mocktails -Amber blush- would also be recommended.\n\nService:\nThe times I've been here I'd say the service is on the slower side, but on par with other fine dining with a more relaxed atmosphere.

Amber India is under a 10 min walk from the Westin St. Francis, where I was staying, so it seemed like a good option. I called ahead and asked if they offer vegan options, and I was told they had many and others could be made vegan. Their menu items looked pricey, so I was expecting to get what I would be paying for.\n\nWhat went well:\n- The hostess held my suitcase at the entrance of the restaurant during my meal, so I didn't have to carry it up or down stairs to my table.\n- My waiter offered an off-menu, vegan yellow dal as an option, which I happily chose as many entree.\n \nWhat didn't go so well:\n- The booth I was sitting in was too low for the table, and I felt like my arms were uncomfortably high to eat any of my food.\n- My appetizer order was taken by a man I later found out was the manager, and a short while later, my waiter came by to ask if I was ready to order. Seemed a little disorganized, and I had to ask him to check on my samosa order to make sure it had been placed.\n- When I was looking at the entree menu, I had many questions about what contained dairy and what didn't. I specified that I have a dairy intolerance to make sure they were taking me seriously. There was a lot of checking with other employees, but no one seemed clear on the ingredients. This lack of knowledge was even more disturbing, considering I later looked closely at some of the symbols next to menu items and realized the vegan items were clearly marked. \n- Based on the phone call I had made, I thought that there were many options and sauces could be modified, but it seemed like neither was the case. There were a couple menu items I could choose, but especially none of the vegan entree items seemed appetizing until I was offered the off-menu entree. I was disappointed that the employee who took my call had misleading answers.\n- Rice doesn't come with your entree, and the entrees aren't exactly cheap. I ended up ordering saffron rice for $4.25, expecting rice that should have been served yellow, and it looked suspiciously like plain white basmati rice when it came.\n- I ordered a wheat roti (marked vegan), and they brought me what was unmistakably naan (not marked vegan).

(To add to this, I read on another Yelp review that the naan also contains eggs, which I don't eat.) I made it clear that I was upset that my questions and requests weren't taken seriously, and both the waiter and manager apologized to me and seemed to take my advice on how to improve very seriously.\n\nTo try to fix the awkward situation with the dairy mix-up, I was brought a complimentary dessert of two scoops of mango sorbet, which I really appreciated. However, I had such a stomachache later from the dairy that this whole dinner really left a bad impression on me. What I would have expected after specifying my dairy intolerance and then still being served dairy via the naan (which I hadn't even ordered in the first place) would be - at the very least - getting the bread for free. I was worried about the cost coming out of the waiter's paycheck, but if I hadn't been planning on expensing this dinner, I would have argued for it. \n\nMy meal total came out to $40.84, including the ginger beer ($4.00), samosas  ($8.95), yellow daal ($14.95), saffron rice ($4.25), and classic naan ($3.95).

We were given an expansive wine menu to look at on the IPad. Since I was driving, I opted out but my husband ordered the Liberty Ale (on tap). We ordered the bread basket for starters which comes with three types of bread: Spinach Roti, Laccha Paratha, and Naan. This is more of an appetizer for 3-4 people, so we had to take some to go. The Laccha Paratha was my favorite because it had some jerk spice that made it flavorful. We tried the crispy potato turnovers because they were new to the menu and this dish was amazing. The garbanzo stew made this dish. The turnovers for this appetizer are tiny, but the dish is worth trying. My husband and I also split the tomato soup. It was delicious and my husband said it was easily in the top 5 best tomato soups he has ever had. The tandoori flavor really shined through in the soup and was unlike any tomato soup I have tasted. \n\nFor the main course I had the Lobster Cream Coconut curry and it came with an empty lobster shell on top for presentation. It was delicious and tasted similar to a vegetarian Korma but still different. It was nice to see fresh chunks of lobster tail in my dish. My husband ordered the Lamb Korma and he said his was very good, but my dish reigned supreme.

Amber's food is a bit Americanized but like I said, it's GOOD and I'm glad they keep at it.\n\nWhat I had:\n1) Aloo Peas Samosas -- potatoes were spiced just right! I usually am a pansy when it comes to spicy food but these samosas had a good 'kick' to them and the sauces that came with it were superb. \n\n2) Butter Chicken with Tandoori Naan and Saffron Rice -- MY FAVORITE. The Butter Chicken was tender and drenched in a rich, buttery, tomato sauce. Each bite I took with the saffron rice (which was, by the way, cooked just right and wonderfully fragrant on its own) was heavenly goodness. As if this wasn't satisfying enough, I used the crispy naan to dip whatever was left of the buttery tomato sauce. YUM.\n\n3) Badam Bhara Baingan -- normally I don't like vegetarian dishes because I feel that too many spices are thrown in to make up for the lack of fat and flavor that comes from meat... but this eggplant dish was great. The eggplant drew a lot of flavor from the caramelized onions (which I love) and I think that was it. There were no add-on complex spices, just simple and savory. The caramelized eggplant and onion complemented the saffron rice so well.\n\n4) Jaipuri Bhindi -- okra dish cooked with tomato and green mango. Wow. It was dee-lish to say the least. It was perfectly seasoned and it had a bit of crisp on the shell of the okra, which gave it a nice texture (I'm used to steaming okra, which makes it soft and gooey). Loved this dish as well! \n\n5) Mango Brulee -- okay, I LOVE anything mango so I might be biased... this creme brulee was sublime. The custard tasted like mango lassi -- sweet, fruity, with a bit of tang -- and, of course, the caramelized top layer provided for a nice crunch with the soft custard. I would definitely recommend this.\n\n6) \"Bru\" Coffee Kulfi with Chocolate Sauce -- I don't like the taste of coffee but this frozen dessert was great... especially when doused in rich chocolate sauce. The combination was sweet! I think I'd stick with the Mango Brulee for dessert, though. \n\nI liked that they had a section for meat-eaters and vegetarians.

The Elaichi (cardamom?) flavor was distinctly mouth-watering and satisfying in each bite.\nNaan and Saffron Rice: Good quality.\nCouple of diet sodas.\n\nThe service we received was way above what we expected, even at a nice restaurant such as this one.

If there were people who were'nt very familiar with Indian food they would not know for instance how to season the papri chaat (with yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney) and doing this may help them.\n\nFor desert there was chocolate orange mouse, payasam and sooji halwa.
