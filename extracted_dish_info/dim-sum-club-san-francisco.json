But regardless, I left feeling queasy and sad. \n\nWe got the shu mai, shrimp dumplings, steamed bbq pork buns, golden yolk buns, xlb, and the beef roll with the rice noodle. \n\nGREASE. Everything was greasy and overly salty. The char siu in the pork buns was so sad... there was more gelatinous sugar \"sauce\" than actual char siu. The shrimp dumplings didn't have nice big pieces of shrimp... but more of like... a paste. \n\nBut I think the most disappointing was the XLB (xiao long bao, shanghai dumpling, whatever you wanna call it.) The soup was not even flavoured well. Instead of a nice mix of soup and filling, the filling was almost... overcooked? You know, when meat gets too cooked and starts to crumble. Imagine dry, overcooked meat in greasy soup and you've pretty much got an idea of what this xlb was like.\n\nMaybe my standards are too high, but even dollar dim sum over in china town beats this place. If you're going to charge legit dim sim prices, please deliver sit-down dim sum quality food. This place? Overpriced and mostly trying to appeal to tourists.

This is the kind of dim sum place you go to if you're new to dim sum, want English menus, and have never experienced Chinese food in the Richmond.\n\nFood:\n1) Chinese Donut Wrapped in Rice Roll\nThe donut was (surprisingly) not over-fried, but the texture of the rice roll was not right at all. It was dense, bland, and didn't have the bounce and chewiness of good rice rolls. Also, this dish did not come with the traditional peanut sauce and sweet sauce that is served at every other dim sum place.\n\n2) Vegetarian Dumplings\nBland. Tasted like eating water. Don't get them.\n\n3) Shanghai Soup Dumplings\nMy friend is a XiaoLongBao aficionado, and he rated these dumplings a thumbs down, 2/5. The soup was too tart and the skin was too thick and sticky. If you want good XLB, go to Shanghai Dumpling King instead :)\n\n4) Salted Egg Yolk Custard Buns\nThe only good dish we ordered! Just the right amount of saltiness, and the custard was oozing out like a proper salted egg yolk bun (unlike an egg custard bun). I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nService was good, but since only 1 out of 4 dishes was tasty, this place gets 2 stars from me.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-12-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Or, if you're on the opposite side of the city, check out Shanghai Dumpling King.

Some of the choices are unbelievably  stellar. Take for instance, the shrimp rice noodle roll otherwise known as ha cheurng fun. There is a rather generous size whole shrimp in each cut piece. The deep fried taro puff is on the smaller side. It's mostly taro but not greasy at all.  the Shanghai dumpling had an ample portion of filling but it didn't have enough broth. \n\nContrary to the posted pictures, the dining room is very nice. there are some booths and some banquettes with hard chairs on the aisle side of the table. Service was friendly and efficient. \n\nThere are no carts.  Mark  your choices on a menu.  Many of the dishes had 4 pieces. Perfect when there are four of you.  I didn't pay but I assume the prices were more reasonable than some of the other more popular dim sum places. \n\nParking is difficult in this neighborhood. Muni was my ride.

Nice and juicy flavor. Came with a mayo dipping sauce but I did not need it!\n\nBeef w/ Cilantro Noodle Roll, $4.25, Very good! The rice noodle crepe was thin and smooth.
