My parents work nearby, so my brother and I will drop in and grab some food from time to time, out of convenience.  Lord knows Dos Amigos is much better than whatever food truck is parked in front of Airbnb.  The horchata is decent but could definitely use more spice.  The quesadilla is browned quite nicely.  The cactus and goat cheese burrito is a bit slimy but overall enjoyable.  The prawn taco is very generously portioned and delicious.
