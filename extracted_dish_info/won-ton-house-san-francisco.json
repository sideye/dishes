While MSG can provide an irritating tingle in my mouth or on my tongue I've never become sick from consuming it.  Sometimes I enjoy living on the edge, and it's those times when I visit the Won Ton House on Noriega Street.\n\nDon't expect impeccable service here.

I eat here because the food is cheap and as much as I hate to admit it I do have some of those cheap-Chinesey genes in me.\n\nLet's take a look at what I've ordered on recent visits:\n\nWon Ton Noodle Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#_o08CiG6XmYhflC8fhnn-w) - The won tons are nice and plump and pretty decent.

Mixed with the coarsely ground pork is a bit of cabbage and sometimes a bit of ginger.  It's not bad and the MSG is minimal.\n\nStewed Beef Brisket Noodle Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#kGkSDCM8wN7sEWGeDcTf3g) - The beef is usually tender and the tendons are properly chewy.  Like the won ton noodle soup the MSG is in its broth.  You'll know what to do.\n\nRoast Duck & BBQ Pork over Noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug) - You can have this over rice too, but I'm always going to be a noodles kind of guy.  As with mostly all Chinese BBQ the MSG is in the marinade.  They use the same sturdy noodles on this as they use in their noodle soups.  They pour some of the fatty liquid from the BBQ meats into the noodle to give it some extra oomph and extra MSG.\n\nMake sure you drink a lot of liquids after eating here just to wash away the MSG.  \n\nSo if MSG and low health scores don't bother you so much, and you want hot, cheap food relatively fast this place is A-OK!", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-04-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Won Ton Noodle soup for $5 cant go wrong with that.

That is, I didn't feel super thirsty after finishing my bowl, but I'm not really a stickler for MSG to begin with. Most Chinese restaurants use it, so it's not a big deal to me.\n\nDuring our first visit, the bf's sister got a noodle dish topped with char siu bbq pork. There was an incredible amount of pork; I was actually thinking about getting this to-go. :p Our second visit, the bf got the spicy Szechuan noodle soup. The noodles looked good and the chunks of beef were lean. I wish they were a *little* more tender than they were, but I'm thinking that this dish might not be a specialty of theirs so personally, I wouldn't pick it. Bf said that the broth was good though.\n\nThe best part of our meals here has been the turnip cake or \"law back gow\". SO GOOD. It's pan-fried so each piece is crispy on the outside, but once you bite into it, it's incredibly soft and pillowy and so smooth.

You can dip the turnip cake in the soup, too, or it might accidentally fall into the soup if your chopstick skills are similar to mine-- then you can fish it out.  Red bean drink is delicious.  Hot tea is dangerously hot; I have an s-shaped burn scar on my arm from when I knocked the hot tea onto my arm in the late 90s, so I am much more cautious with those cups.  \n\nService is hilariously indifferent but at the same time they always take our orders immediately, bring the food out promptly, and provide our bill with no comment.  Our meals, paid for with cash, usually cost around $25 and we get so much food it is always impressive.  We're all quite sensitive to MSG and have never noticed its effects post-meal, so we aren't sure it's used in the foods we eat, but the food provides a high that may mask minor sins.  Did I mention the turnip cake?  It is consistently the best one I've ever had, even from high end dim sum restaurants in SF like Yank Sing and lower end dim sum joints in Oakland's Chinatown.

It's located next to the restaurant with the Sun logo on it (I can't read the chinese characters).  I ordered the Wonton noodle soup and the Ngow Jaap (beef organ) a la carte. My friend ordered the Fish Ball Noodle Soup.\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't impressed with their wontons.  I've had much better wontons in NY and if you're gonna name your restaurant after wontons, I expect the best.  Their wontons are just ok, although it's not bad for the price.  One thing I didn't like was that I thought there was grains of sand or something in my wonton, but no one on yelp has mentioned it before, so it could have just been a one time thing.  \n\nI did like the beef organ dish.  It's the standard dish you'd get at dim sum, but it's missing the intestines and the daikon.  I don't care for intestines, so I don't mind being without that, but I would have loved some daikon in the dish.  I also don't like spleen, so I put all of that to the side.  Haha, the only organs I like in that dish are the different types of beef tripe....Mmm...Yummy.\n\nMy friend said that his fish ball soup was decent, so I'll take his word for it.  The reason why this place gets 4 stars rather than 3 is because the prices are so cheap.  I didn't order any congee, but I saw that they were all around $4.  That's a pretty good deal, so I know where I'll be going if I need congee.  I'm guessing that it's hard to mess up congee, but I'll update this review if it turns out to be bad.  Another plus is that they're open until midnight every day of the week.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-06-22"}], "stew beef brisket noodle soup": [], "ngow jasp noodle soup beef organ": [], "bbq pork noodle soup": [], "curry beef tendon noodle soup": [{"excerpts": ["Curry Beef Tendon Noodle Soup -Served in a bowl with the same designs that you would find at your grandparent's house.

Not at Wonton House! Don't be fooled by their dirt-cheap prices (all their dishes are under $6) - they're very generous with their meat portions!\n\nI came here for dinner to catch up with an ex (AKA former eating partner). We're both food addicts and have a tendency to enable each other's eat-like-there's-no-tomorrow habit. (He even told me that breaking up probably added 10 years back to his life since he will no longer die from obesity!) When it came time to order, we had a hard time narrowing our choices down to 4 dishes because we wanted to try everything (old habits die hard!) Even then our server asked if we could eat all that food. (Well, *we* thought 4 dishes were reasonable for 2 people...) We got:\n\nSZECHUAN SPICY BEEF NOODLE SOUP, #13 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=H7bBbjdubPDOKeD2k5jyng) - we added dumplings to this and were so glad we did! They were little pillows of perfection. The beef was also very tender, not to mention plentiful. The soup wasn't as spicy or flavourful as I would've liked though and the egg noodles got a little soggy later on after soaking in the soup.\n\nBBQ PORK & ROAST DUCK OVER BRAISED NOODLES, #23 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=f52GIBtilK6UoarfF3qlQw) - The noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente and lightly dressed with soy sauce. The B.B.Q. pork was passable but I've had way better. The roast duck was really flavourful and tender though.\n\nFISH & LIVER CONGEE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=bBYReYxQuDNTFPakvYlZhg) - so much fish and so much liver! The liver was a little overcooked but still tasted good. The congee base was OK - a little watery though.\n\nCURRY POTSTICKERS, #57 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=tqAc_KHRIHtU9tNwW9IKeg) - LOVED these! They were filled with an ample amount of perfectly seasoned meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=gSCwB1Y0Yg-5SPDFxcfHTg). The curry flavour made dipping sauces unnecessary but it wasn't overpowering. The skin had just the right texture and wasn't too thick. Though they could've been crispier, I liked that they weren't greasy like at a lot of other restaurants.\n\nI was also very impressed with the service - super fast and friendly!

No frills in the decor or the presentation of the food, but really good flavors and extremely well-priced.\n\nWhen you sit down, the auntie lady acting as both server and cook will bring over two mugs of tea. The tea, while brewed in one of those diner-style coffee carafes, is actually quite good - warming on a chilly night and not over-steeped. \n\nSince this is \"Won Ton House,\" I've only ordered won ton noodle soup, which happens to be my #1 comfort food. It's a really simple dish, so the $4.75 price is fitting. You get a heap of egg noodles, about five wontons with shrimp and pork inside, and broth. No veggies, no meat - though maybe the other options on the menu include them... I'll have to check next time.\n\nThe won tons are very good and are full of meat. Every won ton seemed to have at least one shrimp in it. The broth (chicken-based) is light, but flavorful and I didn't really detect any MSG. That is, I didn't feel super thirsty after finishing my bowl, but I'm not really a stickler for MSG to begin with.
