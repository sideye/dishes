Sun Wah Kue, Jackson Caf\u00e9, Tai Sam Yuen, Uncle's, etc.  As these old time favorites slowly closed, Capital came to be a popular breakfast and lunch spot for the local work force.  They offered breakfast favorites like ham or sausage and eggs, omelets, and my favorite ham and macaroni soup.  For lunch, they offered plates with daily specials which include corn beef and cabbage, ox tail stew (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qeCd6bbxM1T7i7VITWcqDg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).

As time went by I eventually forgot about the restaurant again.\n\nThat is until September of 2014 when I finally decided to check out Capital Restaurant after seeing some delicious pics posted by Scottsdale, Arizona Yelp friend Aileen B.  After just that one visit I was sold, and in the past several months I've found myself returning here more often than I have at any other restaurant when visiting San Francisco Chinatown.\n\nCapital's signature Chicken Wings are indeed a big draw here, and I agree they are very good.  I've certainly ordered it on more than three occasions.  These are big, plump chicken wings fried crispy with just the right amount of salt and jalapeno.\n\nMy favorite item to order on their vast menu however is the Hung Tao Yee Foo Wonton Soup.  This item was introduced to me by a bail bondsman acquaintance whose office I pass daily on my walk to work.  He's a Capital regular and one night while dining at the counter he stopped by and suggested I try this on my next visit.  I certainly did and I found that I really liked it.  The big plump wontons are deep fried then covered up in a rich seafood-filled broth.  You might think that the process completely negates the deep frying by making the wontons soggy again, but here's the secret.  The wontons end up with a delicious toasted flavor unlike any wonton I've ever had before, and the broth is amazing too combining bits of firm shrimp, squid, scallops and assorted mushrooms.\n\nThe Wor Wonton Soup is very good too.  Served in a clearer broth the plump traditional wontons are accompanied by Chinese greens, BBQ pork, mushrooms, shrimp and squid.\n\nIf rice is more favorable to your palate I suggest the Fukien Fried Rice.  It's egg fried rice covered in a gravy filled with chicken, shrimp, squid, scallops, Shiitake mushrooms and Chinese broccoli coins.\n\nOn par with other Chinese restaurants is the Beef Chow Fun with Bean Sprouts.\n\nOne thing I would not recommend is the Fried Crispy Squid which arrived hot and crispy but unseasoned and bland.\n\nThe service here is unlike most Chinatown restaurants in that the waitstaff is generally attentive and friendly, two traits not often associated with Chinatown restaurants.

So, we had plan to go up to the city and play tourist for the day. First stop was to have lunch at Chinatown. \nSo I relayed on my fellow yelpers and found this restaurant. After reading the review we went with open mind.\nWe got there around 11. We got seated right away 13 of us. The adults and toddlers were on one big round table and 4 teenagers were seating across us. So, we adults ordered our own and the kids ordered there own.\n\nFor starters-\n\nFamous fried chicken - crispy, juicy and flavorful \n2 egg roll -  4 very small pieces cut in half, crispy on the outside but very Mushy inside and no flavor and little bit of filling   \n\nMain entree\n\nAdult table-\n\nChicken fried rice - worst fired rice ever, it didn't even look like or tasted like \nchicken fried rice.\n\nClam with black bean sauce - small portions, barely had clam meat in side and it was very very salty. It wasn't good at all. Don't bother getting this dish. Not fresh :(\n\nChicken chow main - noddle with over done, to soggy , very salty, and chicken was old And rubbery. - even the toddlers didn't like it \n\nHoney walnut shrimp - it didn't taste like any of the honey walnut shrimp we ever had. It would of been good but it tasted like they put Lemon juice or some kind of ingredient that didn't go well all together. :(\n\nSweet and sour chicken - now that was just  perfect :) hit the spot,  only good thing there.\n\nBBQ pork egg foo young - meh, no flavor \n\nKids ordered \n\nChicken fried rice, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken and I forgot the other order. They didn't like it, especially the orange chicken - it was overly drenched with sweet sauce that it was over powering and it was hard to eat it. So we told our server that our kids didn't like the orange chicken, b'cuz it didn't taste right at all. There were no apology or asked to exchange the food. All we got was a rude response with evil eye saying that's how our orange chicken is. We asked her nicely to take it back and exchange it for the sweet and sour chicken. She replayed by saying that we would still need to pay for the orange chicken b'cuz that's what we ordered. So we're going back and forth with no solutions at all and got the manager. And same thing, no exchange or apology.  All we got was you order, you pay for it. Typical Chinese~ money money money. Don't care about making your customers happy. - It's the principles \n\nWe were embarrassed we've taken our family here to this restaurant. WORST CHINESE FOOD WE EVER EVER EVER HAD IN OUR WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. $300 down the drain. Don't waste your time and money here. All your gonna get is bad quality food and bad service.

Wow, this is one of the cleanest restaurants I have ever seen in Chinatown.\n\nI wouldn't eat off the floor, but by Chinatown standards this place is immaculate.  Even the restrooms were clean.  But in keeping with Chinatown tradition, I had to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom.  I didn't do the ordering, so these are my best guesses as to what we ate after looking at the (probably incomplete) menu on Yelp.\n\nWe started off with soup.  There were pieces of tofu floating in the soup, along with seaweed or some other green vegetables.  I'm not a big soup fan but I liked it a lot.  I didn't want to fill up on soup because I knew there was much more food to come.\n\nNext came the deep fried flounder.  I love fried fish, but I'm picky about my seafood.  It arrived at our table just warm.  I like it searing hot out of the fryer.  I am sure it would have tasted better fresh, it was just okay.\n\nThen came a plate of spareribs.  Maybe it was the Capital Spareribs?  Some pieces were rather bony and you had to fight for anything to eat.  Other pieces were very meaty.  It was tasty though.  I liked it.\n\nWe had a seafood and vegetable dish I can't find on the menu.  The squid was cooked perfectly.  It was nice and tender, not rubbery.  The same goes for the noodle dish we had.  I can't identify it either, but it wasn't very good anyway.  It was a little greasy.\n\nThe highlight of our meal was the chicken wings everyone talks about.  We saw a couple at a nearby table who ordered nothing but a huge pile of chicken wings.  I was sure it was more food than they could eat in one sitting.  We were incredulous...until we tried them ourselves.  Yes, they were as good as others said they were.  We probably could have knocked off another platter or two.

The restaurant had about 10 persons eating, some asian and the rest visitors. The food was served quickly and it was piping HOT with good flavor which is a good sign  ;)  I did notice on the menu that they DO serve fried oysters which is something I've had before elsewhere but it was years ago, so the next time will try that.

As time went by I eventually forgot about the restaurant again.\n\nThat is until September of 2014 when I finally decided to check out Capital Restaurant after seeing some delicious pics posted by Scottsdale, Arizona Yelp friend Aileen B.  After just that one visit I was sold, and in the past several months I've found myself returning here more often than I have at any other restaurant when visiting San Francisco Chinatown.\n\nCapital's signature Chicken Wings are indeed a big draw here, and I agree they are very good.  I've certainly ordered it on more than three occasions.  These are big, plump chicken wings fried crispy with just the right amount of salt and jalapeno.\n\nMy favorite item to order on their vast menu however is the Hung Tao Yee Foo Wonton Soup.  This item was introduced to me by a bail bondsman acquaintance whose office I pass daily on my walk to work.  He's a Capital regular and one night while dining at the counter he stopped by and suggested I try this on my next visit.  I certainly did and I found that I really liked it.  The big plump wontons are deep fried then covered up in a rich seafood-filled broth.  You might think that the process completely negates the deep frying by making the wontons soggy again, but here's the secret.  The wontons end up with a delicious toasted flavor unlike any wonton I've ever had before, and the broth is amazing too combining bits of firm shrimp, squid, scallops and assorted mushrooms.\n\nThe Wor Wonton Soup is very good too.  Served in a clearer broth the plump traditional wontons are accompanied by Chinese greens, BBQ pork, mushrooms, shrimp and squid.\n\nIf rice is more favorable to your palate I suggest the Fukien Fried Rice.  It's egg fried rice covered in a gravy filled with chicken, shrimp, squid, scallops, Shiitake mushrooms and Chinese broccoli coins.\n\nOn par with other Chinese restaurants is the Beef Chow Fun with Bean Sprouts.\n\nOne thing I would not recommend is the Fried Crispy Squid which arrived hot and crispy but unseasoned and bland.\n\nThe service here is unlike most Chinatown restaurants in that the waitstaff is generally attentive and friendly, two traits not often associated with Chinatown restaurants.

Joke with her, calling her my sista, and she was on it.  WAs super sweet, attentive, and even persuaded us to get two orders of wings and a round of beers.  The wings came and they were hella hot.  Salted just right, with jalapenos to spice it up a bit.  Super cripsy, juicy and yay, pretty good.  And its my favorite part of the wing too.  How could they go wrong then.  Then we ordered the pea pod leaves, tofu mushroom and beef chow fun.  The food came out fast, even with a packed house.  Beef chow fun was a bit bland, but nothing a little soy couldn't fix up.  The others dishes were good.  I enjoyed it, but honestly. . . Chinatown, trying to find parking just to have wings.  Hmm, maybe just a once a year visit will do.  Nothing I can't go thru a Popeye's tp get even more conveniently at.  Any who, and the last bit.  Have fun going to the restroom.  Its way in the back.  You have to walk thru the kitchen, pass all these short chefs, and then go down another level further into the pits to use the restroom.  Its probably some place you don't want to see where your food is prepared, but hell, the food is awesome anyways and I didn't get sick.  I think I won't complain about that tid bit.

"], "author": "Wilhelm Y.", "review": "Throughout my first 7 years on Yelp I had read a number of reviews about Capital Restaurant and their famous chicken wings often referred to as the best chicken wings in Chinatown, and while I may have meant to bookmark the restaurant I never did.  As time went by I eventually forgot about the restaurant again.\n\nThat is until September of 2014 when I finally decided to check out Capital Restaurant after seeing some delicious pics posted by Scottsdale, Arizona Yelp friend Aileen B.  After just that one visit I was sold, and in the past several months I've found myself returning here more often than I have at any other restaurant when visiting San Francisco Chinatown.\n\nCapital's signature Chicken Wings are indeed a big draw here, and I agree they are very good.  I've certainly ordered it on more than three occasions.  These are big, plump chicken wings fried crispy with just the right amount of salt and jalapeno.\n\nMy favorite item to order on their vast menu however is the Hung Tao Yee Foo Wonton Soup.  This item was introduced to me by a bail bondsman acquaintance whose office I pass daily on my walk to work.  He's a Capital regular and one night while dining at the counter he stopped by and suggested I try this on my next visit.  I certainly did and I found that I really liked it.  The big plump wontons are deep fried then covered up in a rich seafood-filled broth.  You might think that the process completely negates the deep frying by making the wontons soggy again, but here's the secret.  The wontons end up with a delicious toasted flavor unlike any wonton I've ever had before, and the broth is amazing too combining bits of firm shrimp, squid, scallops and assorted mushrooms.\n\nThe Wor Wonton Soup is very good too.  Served in a clearer broth the plump traditional wontons are accompanied by Chinese greens, BBQ pork, mushrooms, shrimp and squid.\n\nIf rice is more favorable to your palate I suggest the Fukien Fried Rice.  It's egg fried rice covered in a gravy filled with chicken, shrimp, squid, scallops, Shiitake mushrooms and Chinese broccoli coins.\n\nOn par with other Chinese restaurants is the Beef Chow Fun with Bean Sprouts.\n\nOne thing I would not recommend is the Fried Crispy Squid which arrived hot and crispy but unseasoned and bland.\n\nThe service here is unlike most Chinatown restaurants in that the waitstaff is generally attentive and friendly, two traits not often associated with Chinatown restaurants.  The restaurant is cash only so be sure to come prepared.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-01-17"}, {"excerpts": ["We tried the FUKIEN FRIED RICE (seafood fried rice, I would order that again), BEEF CHOW FUN (not very flavorful) and the HOT & SOUR SOUP (lacked flavor too). \n\n"], "author": "Patrick M.", "review": "Big fan of the SALT & PEPPER WINGS.

All we got was a rude response with evil eye saying that's how our orange chicken is. We asked her nicely to take it back and exchange it for the sweet and sour chicken. She replayed by saying that we would still need to pay for the orange chicken b'cuz that's what we ordered. So we're going back and forth with no solutions at all and got the manager. And same thing, no exchange or apology.  All we got was you order, you pay for it. Typical Chinese~ money money money.

As time went by I eventually forgot about the restaurant again.\n\nThat is until September of 2014 when I finally decided to check out Capital Restaurant after seeing some delicious pics posted by Scottsdale, Arizona Yelp friend Aileen B.  After just that one visit I was sold, and in the past several months I've found myself returning here more often than I have at any other restaurant when visiting San Francisco Chinatown.\n\nCapital's signature Chicken Wings are indeed a big draw here, and I agree they are very good.  I've certainly ordered it on more than three occasions.  These are big, plump chicken wings fried crispy with just the right amount of salt and jalapeno.\n\nMy favorite item to order on their vast menu however is the Hung Tao Yee Foo Wonton Soup.  This item was introduced to me by a bail bondsman acquaintance whose office I pass daily on my walk to work.  He's a Capital regular and one night while dining at the counter he stopped by and suggested I try this on my next visit.  I certainly did and I found that I really liked it.  The big plump wontons are deep fried then covered up in a rich seafood-filled broth.  You might think that the process completely negates the deep frying by making the wontons soggy again, but here's the secret.  The wontons end up with a delicious toasted flavor unlike any wonton I've ever had before, and the broth is amazing too combining bits of firm shrimp, squid, scallops and assorted mushrooms.\n\nThe Wor Wonton Soup is very good too.  Served in a clearer broth the plump traditional wontons are accompanied by Chinese greens, BBQ pork, mushrooms, shrimp and squid.\n\nIf rice is more favorable to your palate I suggest the Fukien Fried Rice.  It's egg fried rice covered in a gravy filled with chicken, shrimp, squid, scallops, Shiitake mushrooms and Chinese broccoli coins.\n\nOn par with other Chinese restaurants is the Beef Chow Fun with Bean Sprouts.\n\nOne thing I would not recommend is the Fried Crispy Squid which arrived hot and crispy but unseasoned and bland.\n\nThe service here is unlike most Chinatown restaurants in that the waitstaff is generally attentive and friendly, two traits not often associated with Chinatown restaurants.

Over the years, it's incredible to fathom how much the neighborhood has changed.  \nFor old timers, this restaurant used to house one of a handful of Chinese American food spots in Chinatown named Mary's.  These places were widely known by local community residents, business people, and some who worked in the Financial District... Sun Wah Kue, Jackson Caf\u00e9, Tai Sam Yuen, Uncle's, etc.  As these old time favorites slowly closed, Capital came to be a popular breakfast and lunch spot for the local work force.  They offered breakfast favorites like ham or sausage and eggs, omelets, and my favorite ham and macaroni soup.  For lunch, they offered plates with daily specials which include corn beef and cabbage, ox tail stew (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qeCd6bbxM1T7i7VITWcqDg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  And for the bigger spenders, prime rib is offered.   Is it a culinary experience?  No, merely a chow down reasonably priced eats place.\nWith the closing of Pacific Court Caf\u00e9, there is a shortage of these businesses in Chinatown other than that roast pork place on Jackson Street.  The nice part here is that you can order Cantonese favorites like chow fun or wonton noodle soup.  \nThey are famous for their salt and pepper chicken wings, crispy, seasoned perfectly and still juicy inside; do not compare them to those Sunset District dry fried chicken wings as they are just different.\nOn a recent weekday lunch, not having ordered or eaten here in a while, I picked up an order of Mapo tofu over rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SEd4VyCI1DWS3U-a_IzBRQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) which did not disappoint.

Talk about first world problems...\n\nKnowing the value of money, I should be haggling at the open markets, \"Two foi three dolla? NO...two foi one dolla and we deal!\" like my mom would.

The prime rib was a bit tough, dry, and bland (I assume being the last slice and all). We really had to utilize the au jus which was oddly sweet. I believe in you pay for you get and this was a prime example.

Some budget-friendly food in Chinatown.  After all, when on the hunt for some good, cheap Chinese food, I can't think of anyone better for some recommendations than CCG!  Well, in addition to my utter uselessness for choosing restaurants in Chinatown (sorry Vicky!) - no joke, most of the places I know of have closed down or changed.  Given the semi-rain that was coming down, we took a short walk and eventually found ourselves at Capital.  \n\nNow, I have to admit...despite having lived in the city for years and years, I had never even heard of Capital and their famous Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings before we went.  When it comes to \"famous wings\", two generally come to mind - San Tung and Hooters.  And really, the latter isn't all that impressive (but the former is...and so good).  After grabbing a table and debating what to get, I ended up going with the Eggplant and Meat Sauce to go with the aforementioned chicken wings.\n\nServed hot out of the kitchen, there certainly is something about Capital's wings that puts the ones I've had at other Chinese restaurants to shame.  Whether it's the crispy skin, the moist and juicy meat, or the perfect seasoning (or all of the above really), it's no wonder people keep going back for more.  While most other places  will be decent in one regard or another, Capital's is good all the way around.  Though they may not top San Tung's wings for me, they are definitely the best Salt and Pepper Wings I've had.  The only drawback I could possibly think of is that it's served literally \"hot out of the kitchen\".  Should you decide not to wait for it to cool, don't be surprised if that oil scalds your tongue a bit.  Sure, it might be worth it at first, but then how are you going to taste the rest of the delicious wings after that?\n\nAs for the Eggplant with \"Meat Sauce\" (essentially ground pork and sauce), it was pretty good, mostly because the eggplants still had bite to them.  It's always nice to see when a place doesn't turn the eggplants to mush by the time the dish reaches the table.  The flavor of the \"meat sauce\" that came with it was good, and I really appreciated that they slather on a whole mess of it either.  In this case though, I did wish there was a bit more on the plate.  \n\nThe funny thing about all of this is that at the restaurant, I thought the food was pretty good and that I would end up rounding up to a four star rating.  The wings are a definite must have on any trip here, while my rice plate was solid, though not spectacular.

It's somewhat rare to have that happen when you're sober and aware, so for that alone, they earned that last half star.

Comes straight out from the fryer, it's salted just right, with garlic and I try to bite it with the jalepeno's as often as I can.  One of these days i'm going to pull a happy hour here with some tsing tao beer and these wings by themselves...probably the best executed salt and pepper wings in the bay area.  Bursting with juices and moist...they've probably brined these tasty wings but who cares... it taste friggen good.\n\nOverall, highly recommend their clay pot and chicken wings.  Just make sure you get a lot of people as the clay pots are huge...and they told me comes in 3 sizes...with the smallest the size of a 9 quart kettle.

A Japanese waiter from Umi told me.  He was drooling just talking their famous chicken wings.  So we go there and see what its all about.  We walk in there with our Santa suits from Santacon.  The owner had to take a picture of us.  We got hella stares, especially from all the older Chinese ladies.  Couldn't help but laugh the whole time, but other than that, let's get to the food and service.  So I speak Cantonese and the waitress and I got chummy chummy already.  Joke with her, calling her my sista, and she was on it.  WAs super sweet, attentive, and even persuaded us to get two orders of wings and a round of beers.  The wings came and they were hella hot.  Salted just right, with jalapenos to spice it up a bit.  Super cripsy, juicy and yay, pretty good.  And its my favorite part of the wing too.  How could they go wrong then.  Then we ordered the pea pod leaves, tofu mushroom and beef chow fun.  The food came out fast, even with a packed house.  Beef chow fun was a bit bland, but nothing a little soy couldn't fix up.  The others dishes were good.  I enjoyed it, but honestly. . . Chinatown, trying to find parking just to have wings.  Hmm, maybe just a once a year visit will do.  Nothing I can't go thru a Popeye's tp get even more conveniently at.  Any who, and the last bit.  Have fun going to the restroom.  Its way in the back.

It is a bare bones place with wooden tables and chairs and a Formica or wood floor.  The waitresses are very nice.  The prices are rock bottom.  Pot stickers have skins that are crispy golden on one side and not too thin or thick and not doughy on the other; the filling of your typical ground pork, ginger, and cabbage filling which is excellent.  The Capital plate (barbecued pork, which is tender and marinaded in Honey and Chinese five spices, egg rolls that are crispy with fresh vegetables, and fried prawns that are greasless, crispy, and succulent.)  The sweet and sour sauce was well balanced.  Round everything off with a Ching Dao and you cannot go wrong.  The bill, which also included my mother's red wine was $21.20.  So, for rock bottom prices, quality service, and excellent food, Capital Restaurant cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-02-25"}], "sunkist": []}
