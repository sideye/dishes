My friends visiting from out of town were persistent about finding an AYCE sushi place, so we decided on Sushi Hunter. I called at 6pm on the 30th and made a reservation for 6:30pm, the girl on the phone was very nice. I showed up around 6:20pm and was seated promptly. It was not super busy which was nice. The environment is OK, the walls are painted bright blue which is a somewhat bright color for  dinner ambience. The place is small, so I imagine the brighter color helps the room feel bigger. \n\nThe service is mostly why I'm rating 5 stars (but don't get me wrong, the food was great too). I've worked in the service industry in the past for many years, so I am very critical of my dining experiences. I didn't catch the name of our server, but she was extremely attentive, knew the menu well, helped me with a recommendation, and made sure we had everything we needed. Any extra plates, dishes, napkins that were taking up space were removed in a timely manner. \n\nMy date and I ordered off the a la cart menu and our dishes came out very quick - we took part in the happy hour and ordered 2 alaska rolls ($6 each) and 1 spicy tuna roll($6), and then ordered the specialty Lion king roll. The Lion King roll ($15 was charged, though I thought the menu said $14) differs from place to place and I have to say their Lion King is my favorite of all the other sushi restaurants I've been too. I really enjoyed the Chicken Karrage happy hour appetizer ($4) which was extremely delicious (the batter was nice and crispy and the meat was very tender), a miso soup($1 Honestly not my favorite miso soup, but very delicious) and the Wakame Salad($3 I LOVED the salad, though its pretty much the same everywhere) as well. We spent $53 including 2 hot teas. \n\nOur other 2 friends ordered the all you can eat - one vegan/vegetarian and one with meat. I talked to them yesterday and they still feel full :P The AYCE takes longer when you order alot of things, so they recommend ordering only 5 things at a time. It did take their dishes much longer for ours to come out, but their dishes always featured alot of items. \n\nIf this place was more convenient to get to, I would make a point to come here more often. When I am in the area craving sushi, Sushi Hunter will be the top of my list. Thank you Sushi Hunter for a great dinner! :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-01-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Wakame - LOVED!

But I'll preface this by saying I've been completely and utterly spoiled by Toronto and its mecca of AYCE sushi places that defies logic, both in terms of price (soooo cheap), quality (soooo good) and quantity (this menu is how many pages long and they're ALL included in the deal?)\n\nAaaanyway, Sushi Hunter is a decent offering for a city with very few AYCE sushi restaurants. The service was super friendly--they actually asked us to move mid-way through our meal to accommodate a large incoming party, and gave us plenty of plum wine on the house to compensate. The decor is pretty minimal and a tad tacky in terms of lighting, but spacious enough that you could easily have a big group and not want for space. \n\nThe food? Here are my thoughts:\n\nAlaska Roll - Rice could have been better and salmon was a bit...soft....but overall satisfying.\n\nPhilly Roll - Not too much cream cheese. That's a good thing.\n\nRock 'n' Roll Roll - My friend's choice. It wasn't bad, but eel does very little to excite me.\n\nWild Fire Roll - Spicy salmon and cucumber. Such simple things bring such great pleasure.\n\nHamachi and Salmon Maki - My two favorite fish in an AYCE setting. Yeah, we ordered a lot of this.\n\nWakame - LOVED! Chewy and perfectly marinated. My friend hadn't had a lot of wakame before and she actually asked if we could order more. Why yes, hon, I believe we can on account of this is an AYCE place!\n\nChicken Karaage - Is there any food the Japanese don't do well? Fried chicken is manna from heaven. Period. This was pretty good. Not super oily with tender meat.\n\nIt's best to come here with a large group (e.g. friends' night out, birthday party, etc.) and just order everything on the menu that catches your fancy. Sushi is obviously very shareable, but most of the other menu items are too, so it's a great \"family dinner\"-style place.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["The wakame salad was amazing.

There's a large variety of stuff you can get.\n\nOk so my advice: go in a huge group, maybe 4-6. Order everything on the menu, share it amongst the group. I feel kinda bad ordering a lot when it's just me and my boyfriend. I peel off the rice and eat the nigiri as sashimi to conserve stomach space. \n\nThe appetizers:\nThe edamame's really good. Nice and warm, nicely salted, good portion, 1 order is enough for 3 people. \nFried tofu's not as good. They should've used egg tofu instead of the gamey tofu. The sauce for the fried tofu could've been more savory too, it's very watered down. Nori and fish shavings would be a nice touch to it too. The horenzo's yummy! It doesn't have the tart feeling on your tongue after you eat normal spinach. The sauce is nice and not too sweet. \nThe wakame salad was amazing. Loads of sesame, nice tangy taste, just the right amount of sauce and chili. We had 4 orders of it. The funny thing was the order portion got bigger and bigger as we got them.\nMiso soup was amazing. Lots of tofu, lots of seaweed, and the sprinkled spring onion makes it perfect. \n\nSushi:\nNigiri's come in 2 pieces per order. Rolls come in 6 pieces per order. Salmon, tuna, ika, eel were yummy. Don't get the seared tuna, it's just tasted like a lower quality tuna, seared, and powered with pepper. The white tuna wasn't nice either, it was very fishy, gamey, and didn't taste fresh at all. The rolls are nice. Small portions but it's nice cuz you can order more. Philadephia was better than San Francisco, the cream cheese adds a nice tangy taste to it. \n\nOther stuff:\nUdon was nice. Good portion for 1-2 people. Broth is clear, noodles were chewy. The crunchy stuff (i forgot what it's called) is really nice in it.\nTeriyaki beef was yummy too. The sauce was tangy.\nThe tempuras weren't my favorite, but my bf liked it. They were missing the raddish stuff that goes in the sauce. The shrimps were teeny and it was over-coated with batter. I'm not accustomed to broccoli and carrot tempura, so that was a bit weird. \nThe curry tonkatsu was nice at first, but it was too much for a person. But it's nice and crispy, the curry wasn't bad either. \n\nTheir plating on the appetizers and other stuff is nice and decent. They do a good job plating it like delicacies. \n\nAlso note their bathroom signs (the boy sign and the girl sign) are a decapitated boy and a decapitated girl. I thought that was really funny. \n\nOverall it's a nice, clean restaurant. The ambiance is nice and relaxing, service was really good (didn't take long to bring our food out, waitresses were cute and on top of their stuff) and bathroom was really big (at least for the girls) and clean.\nI would come here over a normal sushi place like the sushi boat because it's soooooooo much cheaper this way.

They put us at a little 2 person stand alone in between a bunch of other tables en route to the bathroom table, where my boyfriend bitched about staring at/facing the wall.\n\nDefinitely cramped and whenever anyone walked to the bathroom my boyfriend had to scoot his seat in so they could get by...\n\nAside from that issue, our waters were nearly empty at all points in time, the initial waters they gave us were warm (ice had long melted), and only about half full.  When we'd ask for more water, they literally would ignore us and walk around and refill everyone else in the entire place's water and still not refill ours (nor were other patrons waters actually empty as ours were).  \n\nAdditionally, after our initial sushi order, our waitress essentially never came over to us again.\nDuring our first round of rolls my boyfriend discovered a sticker stuck inside a roll, from the skin of an avocado.  Worrisome that 1) they put avocado skins in the sushi rolls, and 2) that the stickers would also be inside the roll.  We pointed this out to one of the waitresses (as ours had never returned), but she sort of laughed like it was no biggie...hm ok.\nSo as many people said, the time between orders is pretty ridic, and when you have no water and are being crammed in between huge parties/tables nearby who constantly need to go to the bathroom and trample you, the experience is that much less enjoyable.\n\nMost of the rolls (as our water in the rare occasions we had water), were somewhat warm, and yes, mostly rice and little fish.  I do like the crunch roll and the devil roll at first, but then after a couple orders i'd rather jump out a window than finish anymore of either of those rolls.\n\nWe had to wait for eternity to be able to tackle someone for a 2nd refill of water (which also hindered our ability to down as much sushi as we could otherwise), and to get our bill.\n\nThis time we will NOT be back. I mean it this time. And if we do return, I am 100% certain I will again regret it.\n\nAwful service, worrisome food.

However, I was disappointed by much more than Sushi Hunter's unwillingness to let me fire my rubber pellets at will. \n \nFirst of all, we were here for a birthday party for the one-and-only Ashley M.  While I give props to the staff for putting up with our incessant sake bombing, boisterous curse-laden toasts and repeated spilling of booze all over the table, the kitchen seemed to be completely overwhelmed by our party of ~20 ordering the famous all-you-can-eat menu.  They couldn't bring out the gyoza, maki, nigiri, or even edamame and sake fast enough to fill our tummies.  And we weren't gorging ourselves or having some sort of eating competition; we were just eating at a normal pace.  There was absolutely, positively no way to get our money's worth of the promised \"all-you-can-eat sushi\" and \"all-you-can-drink sake.\"  No way.  For $24.95 for sushi, $13 for mediocre hot sake and $6/beer, we would have had to have consumed a shit-ton more than we did to make it worth the lump sum we paid at the end of the night.  \n\nIn my mind, the greatest affront Sushi Hunter committed was that after we paid the bill because part of our party was leaving, the waitresses refused to bring us one final bottle of sake to finish off the meal.  Just because a few people left the table and we paid our bill with obligatory 17% tip, service just stops dead?  Good thing my CO2 chamber was emptied by the time that happened...\n\nAdmittedly, I did have a great time for Ashley's birthday party but it was because of the company, not the service or food.  If I ever go back to Sushi Hunter, I'm going in with a vengeance.  I'm wearing camo, I'm not eating for two days beforehand, and I'm chowing down on maki Sonya \"Black Widow\" Thomas-style! Livin' the dream.

Hmmm, really?\n\nThere were so many (too many) things wrong with Sushi Hunter, I apologized to my friend for bringing him here, although the company actually made up for a pretty horrible dinner.\nFirst off, they charge the same amount (around $4.75) for nigiri, and only give you about 2/3 of fish. I'm the kinda sushi fan that believes fish should \"drape\" over the sides of the rice for a decent nigiri. Apparently SH doesn't share that same belief. Their motto? More rice!\n\nI think over 1/2 of what I ate was rice, which is very disappointing. The Hotate nigiri was also disappointing...I'm guessing they use bay scallops instead of the bigger sea scallops, which is why the scallop pieces were chopped up rather than placed over the rice without seaweed.\n\nOur waitress didn't know simple questions when we asked her (such as what fish they serve that are sustainable, or whether the salmon is fresh or farmed, etc.).\n\nWhat I can say is that the decor is alright, very \"aquatic\" themed.
