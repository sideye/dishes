We had no idea what we were seeing and I didn't have time to read the reviews so we came here cold turkey tonight.  Our friends drove us here and Asia SF is located on 9th and Howard and the outside is a bit on the seedy side but the area across the street is under construction, so there must be a new building being built. \n\nWe arrived and were greeting by a lovely woman but then I knew we were in for a fun night!  We ordered the menage a trois for 1-5 guests and it is pretty reasonable for a 3 course meal.\n\n\nWe had 4 appetizers to share and had Tamarind Chicken Satays, Salmon Firecracker, Grilled Shrimp and Herb Salad, and Sake Steamed Mussels.  There were four skewers of chicken satays, 4 salmon firecrackers, plenty of grilled shrimp and herb salad and plenty of mussels!  It was perfect to taste each one.  All were tasty but my favorite were the mussels and firecrackers, so yummy!\n\nThen we each ordered a main course:  Miso glazed salmon (a large tender piece), Baby Got Ribs (6 finger licking pieces), Malaysian Diver Scallops and Filet Mignon!  I had the filet mignon and it was cooked medium rare as I like and very delicious and tender!  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Trio of Mini Ice Cream Cones (tropical flavors including Ube), Bananas Beignets Split with a macadamia nut brittle (yum yum), Calamansi Key Lime Pie, melts in your mouth and Warm Chocolate Cake.  My favorite was mine, the bananas beignet!\n\nWe had the appetizers first and at 8 pm the show began and I had no idea what to expect!  3 dancers came out one by one to dance to popular tunes in costume and my favorite was Aliyah who dances very well.  Then came the main courses and then dessert came and then the second half, 4 dancers came out again.  It is hard to believe that they are transgender and looking glamorous and beautiful dancing on stage.  Aliyah came out and also danced with Luis to a latin song, very well done!\n\nThis is a great place to celebrate special occasions like bachelorette parties, anniversaries, birthdays, to enjoy life and celebrate diversity as well.  When I got home, I later read that Asia SF has been around since 1998 and I didn't even know about it!  I thought it was a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.

I recalled it being better in the past, but it's still better than most other fusion restaurants.  Each time I've gone, I've done the platinum feast for birthdays, and this way we can taste everything and do it family style.\n\nWe started with the blackened tuna sashimi, which was my favorite.  It's tender in the center and fresh, with a nice herbed crust that was just slightly peppery.  The Asia-dillas were good as usual, and the sundried cherry creme fraiche was a nice complement to the duck, but make sure you eat this warm.  The tamarind chicken satays are like any other chicken satay - done well, moist, chicken breast meat, with your standard peanut sauce.  The baby bok choy and shiitakes weren't too special, and they tasted like any other Chinese stir fry.  The grilled shrimp and herb salad was a nice cilantro salad with a sour vinaigrette with a nice kick.  I loved the crisped coconut and chopped peanuts, which added a nice crunch, but the shrimp was a bit overdone.\n\nOn to \"second courses.\"  Usually, I'm not a fan of lamb at all, but I always love their orange lamb.  The sauce is so good with rice and the taro chips, and I love the cucumber salad with it.  The miso glazed salmon has a subtle miso glaze, and it was cooked jst right.  The truffled soba noodles were a bit too oily this time, but I love the truffle scent and mushrooms and asparagus.  The ribs were pretty standard, nothing spectacular - just your usual honey tamarind glaze, but I couldn't taste the tamarind.\n\nAs for dessert, I loved the banana beignets with chocolate and butterscotch dipping sauces.  The banana beignets are crunchy on the outside, smooth/sweet inside, like a halved banana lumpia.  For the ice cream cones, the taro (purple) is my favorite; the other flavors are coconut and lychee.\n\nThe highlights are the performances (they are quite hot..) and birthday shots.  Girls take shots either from the chest, or between the legs (crotch shots).  They have lots of fruity cocktails, of which my favorites were the Jackie's razzledazzle and the sake cosmo.\n\nAfterwards, you can go downstairs, where there's a bar, a DJ, and a stripper pole.  It's pretty much all the diners from your sitting that go down there, but the music was good, and the bartenders are fun and let us do our own \"crotch shots\" among friends.\n\nParking isn't too bad, and it's pretty close to 101.  The area is a bit shady, and meter is free after 6pm (but $3/hour before that).

Asia SF is actually very tastefully done and very entertaining, especially if you come with friends. We came in a party of 20 to celebrate a birthday and we had a blast.\n\nWhile you wait for your table to be ready, you are directed downstairs to the \"club\" portion of the venue, where you can dance, relax, grab a drink. They buzz your pager when everything is set and are shown to your seat. \n\nFood at Asia SF for groups is pre-fix. (There is an a la carte but may not make sense if you've got a crew.) You choose between 3 packages. Our group had the Platinum Group menu which had 9 items + 2 desserts for $48 pp. Note this is before the 20% gratuity and 4% health tax. And of course, doesn't include drinks. You are paying for dinner and show though.\n\nSo the layout of the evening is food and show, and more food and show. The 'ladies' double as the dancers. Super friendly sporting great bodies, and beautiful hair, guys in our group were definitely doing double takes. The sister to the emcee was especially cute.\n\nFood-wise, I was pleasantly surprised by the fusion cuisine. \n5 Appetizers - 1) Blackened Tuna Sashimi (pretty good, but had only a bite since there wasn't enough to go around), 2) Tamarind Chicken Satays (not dry which is good), 3) Asia-dilla (a duck quesadilla which was very tasty), 4) Baby Bok Choy & Shitake Mushroom (nice tender bok choy with sprinkling of mushroom), 5) Grilled Shrimp & Herb Salad (one of my favorites since the shrimp was freshly grilled and overall seasoning was a light thai sauce).\n\n4 Entrees - 1) Salmon (fish itself was typical but the red rice, tomato  and edamame it was served on gave nice texture), 2) Orange Lamb (very tender, not too gamey though I still don't like lamb in general, but was plated with sumono pickles which I love, and taro chips!),  3) Baby Back Ribs (very tasty and tender but requires eating with fingers), 4) Soba noodles (with asparagus and mushroom was ok).\n\n2 Desserts - 1) Mini ice cream cones in a variety of flavors - there were at least coconut, vanilla with nuts, ube, among others. 2) Banana Beignets, more like banana egg rolls which does come with chocolate or butterscotch dipping sauce. It was good but not excellent.\n\nHonestly what gives Asia SF a 4 star ranking is the show. The girls get up and perform on the bar, lip sync to a variety of popular songs, have a lot of fun with the choreography, and play with the audience. Among the more memorable acts was Simone who performed to Beyonce. She can really shake her booty. We were all laughing and having a great time.\n\nThe ladies will also come give blow job shots. Tucked in their ample decolletage, guys can take their shots mouth only. Lots of photo opps for sure.\n\nAnd there was good danceable music played throughout the night. The DJ did creative mixes and played all popular current tunes, upstairs and downstairs in the club.\n\nMade for a very entertaining evening.

When we check in for our 9:15 dinner we were directed to the downstairs bar until our table was ready. Driving from Sacramento, we all needed to use the restroom first. The restrooms are atrocious! I didn't even mind that it was a small space, but the doors didn't lock, the supports were coming out of the wall and the toilet was barely attached to the floor! I thought it was gonna tip over when I flushed! Lol It did have running water, soap and paper towels. \n\nWhen I checked to see if our table was ready, I asked one of the ladies seating people and she just couldn't make up her mind for the longest time if we were one table or the other next to it. Our party was supposed to be next to my brother's party. She finally settled on table, which was the one I expected. When I brought my party from downstairs someone else stopped us asking for the party name and we were directed to other table not next to my brother, but OK. \n\nThere are 3 dinner packages to choose from for 6+ guests: Gold, Platinum and Diamond- each with different plate options. We pre-ordered the Diamond package online with the 14 premium appetizers and a champagne toast- supposedly \"the ultimate feast\". Dinner started coming out and everything looked and tasted pretty good. No complaints there. It is served family style, so for nine people it wasn't the biggest of portions. With 14 appetizers we thought it would be fine. Food was good and came out fairly smoothly while transitioning to the next set of appetizers. \n\nThey informed us champagne would be served and ours came out pretty late compared to everyone else. Once it arrived, we all noticed our glasses were a little less than half full, which seemed odd being that we ordered the highest package. \n\nWe looked around at the large table next to us, where we originally should have been seated, and their champagne glasses were completely full. Judging by their dinner they definitely didn't have the same Diamond package because it does not include burgers. We asked about the champagne and they said that table has a different package. DUH. On the menu, the champagne doesn't come with the Gold or Platinum menu. We ignored the champagne mixup and waited for more food, which took longer than expected compared to the first time with no show in between. \n\nWe received a couple more dishes, but it did not amount to the 14 appetizers as stated on the menu. We did not receive the \"Porcupines\", Baby Got Back Ribs\", and \"Malaysian Diver Scallops\". We tried inquiring about the remainder of the items, but were never answered. Dessert came out and the ice cream cones were good. The \"Banana Beignets\" were OK and the \"Mini Chocolate cakes\" were good if you like dense, rich chocolate. We were given the bill with still no mention of the missing appetizers. Maybe the message got lost in translation? Who knows. \n\nI understand it was really busy, but for a place that has been open for so long and has a high volume of people coming through regularly, you would assume they should expect how busy it can get and better prepare the timing and service. \n\nThe show, dancers and quality of food were good, but the dinner experience was highly underwhelming. The cost for dinner ($75/each), plus added 20% gratuity due to a large party, 4% SF Employer Mandate fee, and tax did not amount to the lack of service and food provided; really disappointing. \n\nI really wanted to love this place and come back often, but honestly, if I do go back it would only be because a different group of friends still wanted to check it out. I don't know how I feel spending another $100 on dinner when you basically only get 1 piece of food from each dish. \n\nIf you do decide to get the Diamond package, I can at least recommend bringing only 6 people so you can get a couple more pieces of food each. You should probably make a day of it in the city as well so you are already full from lunch and not expecting to be full from dinner alone. \n\nAfter this experience, a smaller party of 1-5 people looks like the best option. All small parties get the  3 course dinner menu. Each individual orders a first course, main course and dessert from the entire menu. \n                                  *Side note* \nI was able to take pictures with Bionka and Nya! Nya came to our table and took pictures with us/chatted.They were both wonderful! True gems to AsiaSF! \n\nUpdate: I emailed management the morning after about the poor service. While apologetic, they initially only offered a $79 refund which is the cost for 1 person on Diamond Menu. It wasn't even enough to give each person at least $10 back, so I asked if they could at the very least refund $90 so that could be split evenly. They agreed, but we still don't feel it was comparable to the included gratuity (almost $300!).", "rating": 2, "date": "2018-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The food - I was able to try the Porcupines, Filet Mignon, and the Mini Ice Cream cones.

Because where is the fun in spoiling the surprise? In case any of you unsuspecting readers think you're perusing a page for an Asian restaurant with fine-looking servers... well you'd be kinda right. However you'd be missing the entire point of ASF's trademark, their claim-to-fame, their je ne sais quoi, if you will. The servers and DJ are drag queens and/or transgender beauties who perform on the red bar once you've been served. Oh yeahhhhhhhh. \n\nAnd lemme tell ya, these hot bitches can Lay.It.Down. But we'll get to that later. First the boring stuff. Cocktails are named after current and previous talent (order your server's cocktail if you know what's good for you) and the menu is priced for parties. There's a minimum of $25/person and can go up to $65, depending on what menu package you decide on(minimums/prices vary on selection of menu, day, etc) and your party is encouraged to share the apps, entrees and desserts. We did the Gold Package ($35/person) on a rare Monday night show and it was plenty of food for five. And the food is fantastic. We dined on chicken satay, Ahi burgers and the porcupines,  followed by seared tuna, soba noodles, steak, and ribs. The third course gives you the option of a dessert cocktail or a trio of ice cream cones in tropical and coffee flavors. I ordered the least dessert-y cocktail, natch, but someone else got the ice cream and it was to die. \n\nMid-way through your meal, you'll notice your server disappears. That's because he/she is strapping on that glitter bustier and gluing in those extensions so he/she can rock your world on the bar. I've been to my fair share of drag shows, and I can truly say the ladies of ASF can WERK. Light shows, props, water guns, and killer dance moves will keep you entertained until the last beat drops. Four-five queens perform twice, and of course the costume changes are fierce. Sasha would be proud. \n\nAfter the entertainment, the queens give special attention to those celebrating birthdays, bach parties, etc. And even the occasional curious guy who has never experienced a BJ shot drag queen-style.... \n\nASF was one of the highlights of my SF trip and I can't wait to return for a rowdy Saturday evening. I'm bringing a better camera this time, dammit. \n\nGive these queens a round of APPLAUSE.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The tuna sashimi and porcupines (scallops) were awesome.

And Half full.  Can you get any more tackier than this?\n\nThe 'entertainer' came and put on a show for us in our semi-private room.  Sure, he did try.  He was game.  Sure we screamed and laughed.  And appeared to have a good time.  But when we ask why the show seemed shorter than the 30 minutes we paid for, his reply was, \"you were late\".  How about you were ugly?  Can we get our full money back?  \n\nAfter this we were about ready to leave.  But since we haven't been served our second round of drinks, and for the fortune we paid for, we lingered a little bit in the room (about 10 mins) but was already getting kicked out because the next group was coming in.  So, no drinks, no service and moving to the dance floor.  We waited for another 10 mins- still no drinks.  The whole group went upstairs to talk to the server again and for the nth time asked, \"where are our effing drinks?!\" ...nicely of course. After all, we were bunch of good looking, demure and sophisticated professionals dressed in our sexy and classy cocktail dresses that night. Mr. Server apologized and gave us bullshit excuse of being busy and whatever other reason hence, no drinks. And as we wait for another 10 mins at the \"dining area\", we were constantly getting kicked out or asked to move by other servers because the area is \"reserved\".  Seriousfknly, if we didn't have to wait that long- we would've been gone half an hour ago and out of your \"ripping off\" ways!  \n\nSo half an hour later, the drinks came - now in smaller, just a tad bit bigger than a shot glass sized, plastic cup. I'm very lightweight when it comes to drinking so I know there's hardly any alcohol mixed in that sweet concoction of theirs.  Even to the last moment, no apologies, no shame...we were just getting ripped off.  We came in to this place hungry for food and hungry for a good time, we left angry.  \n\nNot coming back.  Never.  Should you readers decide I'm just hating, and you still want to experience this place for yourself- make sure you speak with the server and have him/her tell you EXACTLY what you are paying for and check your receipt.  DON'T PAY IN ADVANCE until you get everything...and DON'T PAY TIP, unless it's deserved.", "rating": 1, "date": "2011-05-09"}, {"excerpts": ["I also ordered the \"porcupines\" and the warm chocolate cake but again, I don't remember eating them "], "author": "J S.", "review": "My partner and I decided that this would be our big \"fancy pants\" dinner while in San Francisco and were very excited.  You would think, based on their website photos, that this would be a swanky place to dine while being entertained.  We were both thinking something on the order of Boom Noodle decor with transexual waitresses . \n\nWell, it's not. It's pretty much a run-of-the-mill somewhat divey and cramped gay bar with a basement dancefloor in a sketchy SOMA district neighborhood sprinkled with fancy dazzle camoflauge to disguise this fact. However it works in its favor since the \"gender illusionist\" servers are also decked out in dazzle camoflauge to disguise the fact that they were once men.\n\nThey encourage large groups (weirdly enough the majority of which were bachelorette parties), lots of drinking, and rowdy behavior. If there are less than five of you you will be seated at the bar which has it's advantages and disadvantages. \n\nThe advantage is you will literally have a  front row seat to the show. The disadvantage is you will not be served by a performer. Your server will be the bartender. Our bartender was very attentive and poured a stiff drink so no complaints there. And the drinks are named after the performers so it's kind of fun sipping a lady's cocktail as she's performing (assuming that these really are their drinks of choice).\n\nFood wise, it's exactly how they describe it on their website:  \"3 star Pan Asian cuisine\". Since there's no indication of the overall rating scale (Is it 3 out of 5? 3 out of 10? 3 out of 3?) let's just say the food was hot and good.  However, if there are less than five in your party you're required to order one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert from the prix fixe a la carte menu. \n\nAt this point my partner and I were exhausted and trashed, having arrived in San Fran at 10am that morning and going non-stop so the only thing I actually remember eating were the ribs which I mistakenly thought were boneless. At least they were fall off the bone tasty. Let's just say I was a sloppy mess afterward but I didn't feel too bad because the woman sitting next to me ordered some as well and was a bigger mess than me. We actually bonded over this fact and then she asked me what was the difference between a tranny and a transexual which made for an interestingly humorous conversation.\n\nI also ordered the \"porcupines\" and the warm chocolate cake but again, I don't remember eating them but I imagine they were delicious since I cleaned my plate.\n\nAt the top of the hour you are treated to a performance by 2-3 performers. The performers are not the best in world and in fact most of them barely even attempt to lip sync along with the music. It's more of a:  \"Look at me dance back and forth on the red stage. Oh yeah, I forgot! I should mouth a few lines to the music.\"  Nonetheless it's still entertaining. \n\nWe watched a couple of performers mocking the performer on stage unbeknownst to her so that was a hoot and makes me wonder how much cattiness goes on around here.  Also, in one of the back booths were  two smarmy old white dudes who were either the owners or the backers or something. The ladies all paid them enormous amounts of attention at different points in the evening.  It reeked of those old school 70s made for TV movies about runway girls getting caught up in the seedy underbelly of the streets. It was also another source of unintentional entertainment.\n\nReally the best performer of all was the hostess. She was like Divine's younger, prettier sister or something and when she sang \"It's Raining Men\" and ripped off her dress to reveal a Superwoman costume underneath the crowd went through the roof. You can also leave a tip on your bill for your favorite performer but we found it hard to remember all of their names.\n\nAsia SF opened up months after I left San Fran to move to the Pac Northwest so for the past 12 years I've been dying to go. I was not disappointed. It was a fun time with good service and an atmosphere that works in its favor but next time I'll make sure there's a large group of us to get the full on experience. \n\nAlso, it's a bit expensive but not fancy as we initially thought. We were a bit disappointed in that regard and decided to re-try the fancy dinner thing again at Alioto's the next night (Big mistake. See my review for that place too).\n\nOverall a 4 star adventure.

When they found out that I didn't want to go, we were going to go somewhere else, but I convinced them that it was ok and in we went.\n\nThe whole establishment is quite small with the restaurant upstairs and the club downstairs. In the middle of the room is the bar (and the dance stage). We were seated and since we were a party of three, we were able to order the menage a trois. My sister and I ordered our drinks (I believe one of was pink kitten but I forgot the name of the other) which were sweet and delicious. For our meal, we each ordered something different so we could try as many courses in our one trip. For the first course we ordered, the porcupines, the ahi burger, and the blackened tuna sashimi. The porcupines were excellent with the dipping sauce. My sister loved the sauce so much, she saved it for other dishes that came along later in the meal. The ahi burger was HUGE! I could've eatten it as my main course. It was delicious! The blackened tuna sashimi was also good, however it had a VERY strong pepper taste that gave it quite a kick.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the \"baby got back\" ribs, sansho spiced filet mignon, and the miso glazed king salmon. The ribs were moist and very soft. The glaze was phenomenal!  The filet mignon was also cooked to perfection and the potato stars were the cutest things ever! It reminded us of the happy faced potatoes from the jelly belly factory. The salmon was juicy and very flavorful.\n\nThere were two \"ladies\" that we couldn't tell if they were real women or one of the \"ladies\" but when they stepped on stage for the show (the \"ladies\" dancing & lip syncing), that gave it away. Haha my bf was trying to figure it out the whole time prior the show. Man were those two a doozie! One of the \"ladies\" gave us a free shot of something really sweet and tasted yummie! The show was hilarious and quite amusing. My favorite was the last \"lady\" who sang \"Everyone's been F*ing but Me.\" One of the owners could be seen walking around talking to customers and refilling water. He looked like he was having a blast. He must really enjoy his company!\n\nBy dessert, I had enough alcohol so we stayed away from the dessert drinks. Yes, I'm a light weight but only recently! ^^;; Our \"waitress\" had highly recommended the warm chocolate cake (saying it was better than sex) so my sister ordered the dish. I ordered the banana beignet split while my bf ordered the trio of miniature ice cream cones.  The chocolate cake was moist and pretty good (tho I wouldnt say it was better than sex). The banana beignet was too big for me to finish alone (I didn't realize it was to serve two people in the first place) in addition to me being too gone to take in too much food/drink prior to the dessert even arriving.The miniature ice cream cones were so adorable and creamy.\n\nDefinitely will be returning with some unsuspecting friends! ^_^", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-01-07"}, {"excerpts": ["The food is all pre-fixed but you do have a number of options; since there were only two of us, we went with the porcupines and tuna sashimi for appetizers.

Because where is the fun in spoiling the surprise? In case any of you unsuspecting readers think you're perusing a page for an Asian restaurant with fine-looking servers... well you'd be kinda right. However you'd be missing the entire point of ASF's trademark, their claim-to-fame, their je ne sais quoi, if you will. The servers and DJ are drag queens and/or transgender beauties who perform on the red bar once you've been served. Oh yeahhhhhhhh. \n\nAnd lemme tell ya, these hot bitches can Lay.It.Down. But we'll get to that later. First the boring stuff. Cocktails are named after current and previous talent (order your server's cocktail if you know what's good for you) and the menu is priced for parties. There's a minimum of $25/person and can go up to $65, depending on what menu package you decide on(minimums/prices vary on selection of menu, day, etc) and your party is encouraged to share the apps, entrees and desserts. We did the Gold Package ($35/person) on a rare Monday night show and it was plenty of food for five. And the food is fantastic. We dined on chicken satay, Ahi burgers and the porcupines,  followed by seared tuna, soba noodles, steak, and ribs. The third course gives you the option of a dessert cocktail or a trio of ice cream cones in tropical and coffee flavors. I ordered the least dessert-y cocktail, natch, but someone else got the ice cream and it was to die. \n\nMid-way through your meal, you'll notice your server disappears. That's because he/she is strapping on that glitter bustier and gluing in those extensions so he/she can rock your world on the bar. I've been to my fair share of drag shows, and I can truly say the ladies of ASF can WERK. Light shows, props, water guns, and killer dance moves will keep you entertained until the last beat drops. Four-five queens perform twice, and of course the costume changes are fierce. Sasha would be proud. \n\nAfter the entertainment, the queens give special attention to those celebrating birthdays, bach parties, etc. And even the occasional curious guy who has never experienced a BJ shot drag queen-style.... \n\nASF was one of the highlights of my SF trip and I can't wait to return for a rowdy Saturday evening.

We had one of the center tables, but honestly, no matter where you sit, you'll get a pretty good view of the shows. The waiters (waitresses? I'm confused) came around a lot to check up on us to see how we were doing. Two hot trannies also came to give shots off their boobs for the birthday girls.

The 'Truffled Soba Noodles' (grilled portobello mushroom & asparagus slices, tossed with cool sesame soba noodles, white truffle oil & scallion threads) were a little bland and not as tasty as the other dishes.\n\nAnd of course a meal would not be complete without 'Miniature Ice Cream Cones' (ube with toasted coconut, langka with sun-dried cherries, macapuno topped with candied peanuts) which were wonderful!\n\nNothing would have paired better with any of these dishes but a variety of cocktails!

I came here with five of my girlfriends for their Dine About Town menu, and as we had expected, the most memorable aspect of our evening was the entertainment. The waitresses on duty danced and lip-synched their hearts out in two shows, and we were astounded at how authentically feminine they seemed. Our waitress had a spunky attitude and kindly took the time out of her busy performaning and costume-changing schedule to be photographed with us. Two of the other waitresses told us that they used to be brothers, and now they are sisters, and stunningly beautiful to boot.

When we check in for our 9:15 dinner we were directed to the downstairs bar until our table was ready. Driving from Sacramento, we all needed to use the restroom first. The restrooms are atrocious! I didn't even mind that it was a small space, but the doors didn't lock, the supports were coming out of the wall and the toilet was barely attached to the floor! I thought it was gonna tip over when I flushed! Lol It did have running water, soap and paper towels. \n\nWhen I checked to see if our table was ready, I asked one of the ladies seating people and she just couldn't make up her mind for the longest time if we were one table or the other next to it. Our party was supposed to be next to my brother's party. She finally settled on table, which was the one I expected. When I brought my party from downstairs someone else stopped us asking for the party name and we were directed to other table not next to my brother, but OK. \n\nThere are 3 dinner packages to choose from for 6+ guests: Gold, Platinum and Diamond- each with different plate options. We pre-ordered the Diamond package online with the 14 premium appetizers and a champagne toast- supposedly \"the ultimate feast\". Dinner started coming out and everything looked and tasted pretty good. No complaints there. It is served family style, so for nine people it wasn't the biggest of portions. With 14 appetizers we thought it would be fine. Food was good and came out fairly smoothly while transitioning to the next set of appetizers. \n\nThey informed us champagne would be served and ours came out pretty late compared to everyone else. Once it arrived, we all noticed our glasses were a little less than half full, which seemed odd being that we ordered the highest package. \n\nWe looked around at the large table next to us, where we originally should have been seated, and their champagne glasses were completely full. Judging by their dinner they definitely didn't have the same Diamond package because it does not include burgers. We asked about the champagne and they said that table has a different package. DUH. On the menu, the champagne doesn't come with the Gold or Platinum menu. We ignored the champagne mixup and waited for more food, which took longer than expected compared to the first time with no show in between. \n\nWe received a couple more dishes, but it did not amount to the 14 appetizers as stated on the menu. We did not receive the \"Porcupines\", Baby Got Back Ribs\", and \"Malaysian Diver Scallops\". We tried inquiring about the remainder of the items, but were never answered. Dessert came out and the ice cream cones were good. The \"Banana Beignets\" were OK and the \"Mini Chocolate cakes\" were good if you like dense, rich chocolate. We were given the bill with still no mention of the missing appetizers. Maybe the message got lost in translation? Who knows. \n\nI understand it was really busy, but for a place that has been open for so long and has a high volume of people coming through regularly, you would assume they should expect how busy it can get and better prepare the timing and service. \n\nThe show, dancers and quality of food were good, but the dinner experience was highly underwhelming. The cost for dinner ($75/each), plus added 20% gratuity due to a large party, 4% SF Employer Mandate fee, and tax did not amount to the lack of service and food provided; really disappointing. \n\nI really wanted to love this place and come back often, but honestly, if I do go back it would only be because a different group of friends still wanted to check it out. I don't know how I feel spending another $100 on dinner when you basically only get 1 piece of food from each dish. \n\nIf you do decide to get the Diamond package, I can at least recommend bringing only 6 people so you can get a couple more pieces of food each. You should probably make a day of it in the city as well so you are already full from lunch and not expecting to be full from dinner alone. \n\nAfter this experience, a smaller party of 1-5 people looks like the best option. All small parties get the  3 course dinner menu. Each individual orders a first course, main course and dessert from the entire menu. \n                                  *Side note* \nI was able to take pictures with Bionka and Nya! Nya came to our table and took pictures with us/chatted.They were both wonderful! True gems to AsiaSF! \n\nUpdate: I emailed management the morning after about the poor service. While apologetic, they initially only offered a $79 refund which is the cost for 1 person on Diamond Menu. It wasn't even enough to give each person at least $10 back, so I asked if they could at the very least refund $90 so that could be split evenly. They agreed, but we still don't feel it was comparable to the included gratuity (almost $300!).", "rating": 2, "date": "2018-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Baby Got Back Ribs: Tender baby-back pork ribs with a honey-tamarind glaze, grilled, served with pickled carrots and Japanese sweet potato crisps\n", "*Cool Sesame Soba Noodles: Buckwheat noodles, carrots, marinated tofu, English cucumber and green onion tossed in a Chinese style nutty sesame sauce\n", "*Trio of Mini Ice Cream Cones: Macapuno topped with a candied peanut, Ube topped with toasted coconut, Langka topped with sun-dried cherries\n", "*Warm Banana Beignets: "], "author": "Elena N.", "review": "The ladies here are hot!

I mean seriously where else are you going to find a place where you eat pretty good food while being entertained by beautiful trannies?  They are just fabulous.  Its hard to not stare and be like.. no it can't be.. is it? maybe?  how..? \n\nOf course I had heard so much about this place and so many other people have but have not gone.  Seriously if you have not come you need to.  Its perfect for a night out with girls catching up, bachelorette parties, or in my case my 25th Bday party dinner. \n\nThis place is much smaller than you think it is and its basically two floors.  Downstairs is the bar/club area where you can stay while waiting for your table or for after your dinner.  They have a bar down there with a bunch of bras hanging. haha.  So people leave this place bra-less? Interesting. \n\nSo to make sure the place wasn't booked and I got the ideal time of 7:30pm I called in 3 months ahead of time.  They are super great with reservations and completely understanding that with big parties it fluctuates.  I literally changed my reservation from 15 to 19 to 17 etc about 5 times and worked with Kim.  She was super nice about it.  I ended up with 17 people at my party. \n\nMy only qualm.. and me as in my friends is that its a bit pricey.  I totally think its worth it and know that its a once in a lifetime thing.  You wouldn't come to this type of thing all the time so thats why I wasn't bothered by it. \n\nSo its a pre-fix menu and you literally get everything on the menu.  I got a personalized menu too which was cute!  Will def keep for scrapbook purposes. haha. \n\nThey organized the dinner so well.. they bring the appetizers and everyone at the tables shares everything and their is def plenty of food.  Plenty of leftovers that we didn't bother taking home. \n\nSo the appetizers came first.. when we finished their was a performance of the \"girls\" lip synching with their hot bodes in scantliy clad clothes on the bar and then after then we got our entreees and got another performance by 4 \"girls.\" \n\nSo the food breakdown:  We had to get the Platinum menu because we were going on a Saturday evening so it was 48 bucks per person but plus tax 9.5% in SF and gratuity which is 20% its about 63ish bucks per person so I said 65 bucks. This is without drinks of course.  The drinks are yummy and they are about 10 bucks unless its wine so its like 8 or 9 bucks. \n\nPlatinum Feast:  \n- Tuna Sashimi (nice and fresh) \n- Asia Dilla- (very yummy and cheesy) \n- Chicken Satays (these were really DRY so maybe I had to douse it in sauce)\n- Baby Bok shoy and shitakes (great veggies for people that like it like me) \n- Grilled shrimp and herb salad (very seafoody- yum) \n\nEntree:\n- Orange lamb or tofu if you are vegetarian (got the lamb and it was tasty) \n- King Salmon (this was really good on a bed of black rice or something) \n- Soba Noodles (this was cold and grey and kinda odd- too soury for me) \n- Ribs (yum! fell of the bone so tender) \n\nDessert:\n- miniature ice cream cone that they put candles on for me to blow out!\n- Banana Beignet with chocolate and butterscotch sauce (SOO delicious- if I wasn't so full I'd eat more) \n\nBonus I got a blow job shot in between the legs of the \"women\" lol kinda freaky. \n\nAnyways I had a wonderful time.

Reservations were made 2 weeks in advance for her, me and two other friends of mine on a Friday night. Definitely plan ahead and make reservations at least a couple of weeks beforehand because this place is popular! For a dinner + show combo, expect to pay about $60+ with tax and tip included. Additional drinks are around $12. The dinner portion will include 3 courses per person (you can choose from anything on the menu) and the show is spaced out throughout the meal so that you have plenty of time in between segments to eat.\n\nVIBE/AMBIENCE: Classier than I presumed, with strategically placed lighting, modern hues and plush seating. Music is on the louder side but not any worse than at a typical bar. There is a red carpet and a screen backdrop outside the restaurant where you can have your photo professionally taken for free, adding to the aura of glamor.\n\nDRESS CODE: Do come dressed fashionably. I don't think they'll turn you away if you show up in jeans, but you'll probably be the only one there wearing denim. Most of the customers I saw were in cocktail-wear: knee-length dresses, dress slacks, heels and lots of pretty, shiny jewelry.\n\nDRINKS: I got the Trina's Pussycat (hey, when in Rome....) and it was very fruity and sweet, not strong, served in a big martini glass. One friend got the Lychee Blue Cura\u00e7ao, and it was the same fruity, sweet, not-strong caliber. Check in on Yelp and you can get a free shot (one per person per check-in). Three of us did that (the fourth girl couldn't download the Yelp app), so we did shots halfway through our dinner. They were very sweet and diluted. I imagine you'd have to down at least 10 just to get a buzz. Now, if you decide to pay for shots, you will have a far different experience from the free ones. Men must drink their shots from the cleavage of the waitress. The glass is wedged into the cleavage and the man must get it using only his mouth, though he is encouraged to hold onto the waitress's breasts for balance. Women must drink their shots from the waitress's crotch. The waitress sits down, puts the shot glass between her legs and the woman must get down on her knees and use only her mouth to pick up the glass. All this to say, order shots at your own risk!\n\nFOOD: The diplomatic way to say this would be that people do not come here for the culinary experience. Seriously, my out-of-town friend is an avid food blogger who photographs every morsel of food she ever comes near. She's the girl annoying everyone with her camera's flash at a fancy restaurant, that's how devoted she is. Well, she didn't even bother photographing her food at AsiaSF. It's not that anything was inedible, but it just wasn't very good (even though the presentations were rather pretty). I had the grilled shrimp and herb salad. The shrimp was already cold and the herbs were overwhelming (I don't think it's ever a good idea to pair cilantro and scallions--two very pungent herbs--in the same dish). The truffled soba noodles had absolutely no truffle flavor whatsoever and were smothered in a thick, creamy, peanut-like sauce that I couldn't take more than two bites of. I ended up swapping it for my friend's fish and forbidden rice, which was much better. The dessert was probably the best. We shared the black rice pudding with mango and the banana sundae. I'd definitely recommend the rice pudding.\n\nSERVICE: Lovely! Every staff person was warm, friendly and outgoing.\n\nTHE SHOW: Entertaining to watch, but I was disappointed that it wasn't more....daring. I've been to my fair share of drag queen/transgendered shows and they're always fun. The most shocking was probably a show I watched in Provincetown, Cape Cod, MA. Not only were the drag queens amazing dancers in amazing costumes moving to amazing music, but there was one particular performer who was called \"The Question\" or something like that who appeared naked expect for some strategically placed pasties. The idea was that no one could tell if she was actually a woman or just a very, uh, flexible man. Given AsiaSF's reputation (and SF's reputation in general), I was kind of expecting that same level of envelope-pushing. But the show was definitely on the safe size, with almost no strip-tease, outfits that covered everything and average dance moves. I guess I expected the performers to do more than just strut around lip-syncing to pop songs.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely a place to have a good time.

The fun definitely comes with the crowd of people you go with. Overall, I liked the energy and diversity of the crowd.  \n\nFood is prefixed and served tapas/family style. My favorites were the tuna sashimi, baby bak choy and shiitakes, miso glazed salmon, coconut jasmine rice from the orange lamb dish, and their icecream cones. YUM. I didn't care for their shrimp herb salad; there was a bit too much cilantro in it. And I thought they went a little overboard on the truffle oil with their truffled soba noodles. Cocktails are not included with the meal, but portions are generous to the point of being filling. I recommend Amber's Sex Kitten, and Aliyah's Lychee Breeze.\n\nThe dance floor downstairs is small and poorly ventilated (even when it's empty).

Upon planning the party, I remembered having fun at Asia SF years ago when I first came for a friend's 24th birthday party, and so figured reserving platinum dinner seats for the bride-to-be and her friends would be a fun way to start off a night which would end with some dancing at the Asia SF club.\n\nWe arrived on time and were seated 10-15 minutes later.

I really don't want to hear \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\" remixed with a beat.  Heck, I'd rather dance to a top 40 radio station broadcast--commercials and all.  My recommendation:  If you ask, Asia SF will provide you with a list of clubs in the vicinity (for free).  Hit up one of these instead of wasting time at Asia SF after dinner.\n\nSPOTLIGHT SHOW:  Do not opt for a package with this inclusion as it is basically a tongue-in-cheek, 5 minute lapdance for the bride-to-be by one of their \"ladies\".  It's over quickly, takes place in their club on a non-elevated stage in front of the public, and is not that glamorous.  \n\nFirst visit:  4 stars.\nSecond visit:  3 stars.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-06-21"}, {"excerpts": ["First course: blackened tuna sashimi, tamarind chicken satays, truffled soba noodles, grilled ship and herb salad, sauteed baby bok choy & shitake mushrooms.

Each time I've gone, I've done the platinum feast for birthdays, and this way we can taste everything and do it family style.\n\nWe started with the blackened tuna sashimi, which was my favorite.  It's tender in the center and fresh, with a nice herbed crust that was just slightly peppery.  The Asia-dillas were good as usual, and the sundried cherry creme fraiche was a nice complement to the duck, but make sure you eat this warm.  The tamarind chicken satays are like any other chicken satay - done well, moist, chicken breast meat, with your standard peanut sauce.  The baby bok choy and shiitakes weren't too special, and they tasted like any other Chinese stir fry.  The grilled shrimp and herb salad was a nice cilantro salad with a sour vinaigrette with a nice kick.  I loved the crisped coconut and chopped peanuts, which added a nice crunch, but the shrimp was a bit overdone.\n\nOn to \"second courses.\"  Usually, I'm not a fan of lamb at all, but I always love their orange lamb.  The sauce is so good with rice and the taro chips, and I love the cucumber salad with it.  The miso glazed salmon has a subtle miso glaze, and it was cooked jst right.  The truffled soba noodles were a bit too oily this time, but I love the truffle scent and mushrooms and asparagus.  The ribs were pretty standard, nothing spectacular - just your usual honey tamarind glaze, but I couldn't taste the tamarind.\n\nAs for dessert, I loved the banana beignets with chocolate and butterscotch dipping sauces.  The banana beignets are crunchy on the outside, smooth/sweet inside, like a halved banana lumpia.  For the ice cream cones, the taro (purple) is my favorite; the other flavors are coconut and lychee.\n\nThe highlights are the performances (they are quite hot..) and birthday shots.  Girls take shots either from the chest, or between the legs (crotch shots).  They have lots of fruity cocktails, of which my favorites were the Jackie's razzledazzle and the sake cosmo.\n\nAfterwards, you can go downstairs, where there's a bar, a DJ, and a stripper pole.  It's pretty much all the diners from your sitting that go down there, but the music was good, and the bartenders are fun and let us do our own \"crotch shots\" among friends.\n\nParking isn't too bad, and it's pretty close to 101.  The area is a bit shady, and meter is free after 6pm (but $3/hour before that).  My only other complaint is that there are only 2 bathroom stalls.\n\nIt'll probably cost $70-100 per person with drinks, but it's a very unique experience.  Even though I've gone so many times, it's always fun with a big group, and the food is pretty good for a performance venue.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Interesting\nTruffled Soba Noodles: I didn't taste the truffle oil, but it was yummy\n", "RIbs: ", "My FAVE of the nite; succulent, fall off the bone, just the way ribs are supposed to be!\n", "Dessert: ", "Mini ice cream cones and banana beignets- "], "author": "Jocelyn L.", "review": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this place but because my expectations were so low, i think i enjoyed my experience much more!\nOur servers, who double-up as performers were very friendly, SEXY and entertaining.

They had such a great time flirting with the servers and making off-color jokes that some declared a desire to emigrate.  Try it.  The stuffier the visitor, the better candidate they are for AsiaSF.  They will discover a side of themselves - an openness - they never knew they had.  San Francisco can be very freeing like that.  \n\nHonestly, this place is a great answer to the question:  \"Where should I take Aunt Betty and Uncle Bill who are visiting from Toledo?  They are staying at the Wharf, but I want them to really get a feel for the city.\"  Bring them here, but don't give them any advance warning.

Quite possibly, I was even a transgendered dancer who lived such a noble existence that I was rewarded with being the gender of my choice in this life. My only question for our maker is: why didn't my dancing talents carry over? \n\nLast weekend was my cousin, Linda's, bachelorette party, and part of the festivities took place at the scandalous, the amazing, and the flamboyant ASIA SF! \n\nThere are two parts to Asia SF: the dinner upstairs and the dancing downstairs. Upstairs is interesting because it features a \"gender illusionist\" show in which transsexual and transvestite performers lip sync and dance on top of a bar that graces the center of the dining room. Are the gender illusionists gorgeous? Yes. Do they have big boobs? Very. Are their moves good? Awesome. Can you tell they are/were men? Maybe a little if you're up close. But seated at my dining table and feasting away on the food, I was entranced. More on this in a moment. \n\nI wouldn't recommend Asia SF for just its food, which is on the mediocre and pricey side. Only two items elicited some excitement from me: the orange lamb with coconut jasmine rice and the miso glazed salmon. The other items I sampled were on the forgettable side: the duck quesadilla, the seared ahi tuna, the chicken satay, the baby back ribs, the grilled shrimp salad, and the truffled soba noodles.

Asia SF seemed like it would be a fun place to try, and a fun place it was...\n\nThe entertainment was fantastic.  The waitresses were hilarious, friendly, and pretty attentive, given they do twice as much as waitresses anywhere else.  Every hour the ladies do a show on the \"runway bar\", and they don't disappoint.  The ladies are hot, the legs are long, and when you've got good company and lots of drinks, you're bound to have a good time.  At one point, our waitress took our friend and had him take a blow-job shot from between her legs at the bar.  Many a priceless photo were taken that night.\n\nSince this is also a restaurant, time to review the food.  We were a group of 6, and if you have a group of 6 or less (yeah, less?), you can do some deal where everyone gets to pick one first course, one second course, and one dessert or dessert drink, for 31$ a person.  I picked some special-of-the-day scallop and noodle dish as my first course, the orange lamb for the second course, and the pineapple cheesecake for dessert (see photos of all 3 dishes).  Some of my friends ordered the asia-dillas, the blackened tuna sashimi, and the truffled soba noodles, and the filet mignon.  No one had any complaints.  For drinks, I stuck to the sex kitten and some other girly-and-oh-so-tasty drink.  Both were excellent and kept me well-entertained throughout the night.\n\nUnfortunately, I went to Asia SF the same week I went to a few other extremely tasty restaurants for food, so while the entertainment was fantastic and the food was pretty good at Asia SF, I can't bring myself to give it 5-stars.

Not only was the show great but the food wasn't too shabby either.\n\nThe 'Tamarind Chicken Satay' (marinated chicken breast, skewered and grilled, served with Asia SF's spicy peanut sauce)  was a nice lite starter and the sauce was delicious.  The 'Porcupines' (shrimp, scallops & water chestnuts rolled in cellophane noodles, crisply fried & served with a plum wine/soy dipping sauce) and the 'Asia-dilla' (a quesadilla stuffed with duck, jack & manchego cheese, fresno peppers and scallions, with sun-dried cherry creme fraiche) were both good but neither overly memorable.  I thought the 'Sesame Steak Salad' (thinly sliced beef tenderloin seared and tossed in a sesame dressing, piled atop crisp greens, red onions, mint, and basil) was awesome-it was bright and full of flavor!  The 'Ahi Burger' (freshly ground pan seared ahi tuna, with a teriyaki glaze & horseradish-Chinese cabbage slaw on a focaccia roll) was also delicious, it tasted so fresh!\n\nMoving on......the 'Baby Got Back Ribs' (baby-back pork ribs, grilled with a honey-tamarind glaze, served with pickled carrots and japanese sweet potato crisps) & the 'Orange Lamb' (pieces of lamb sirloin sauteed in a mildly spiced orange sauce, served with coconut jasmine rice & thai cucumber salad) were the best!

Six of us shared the platinum menu, but I think we were charged as seven, which might explain while there was actually enough food for everyone.

My favorite thing of the dish was the grilled eggplant. I thought the meat was a little tough but well seasoned and the potato stars seemed a little gimmicky. My friend had the miso glazed salmon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=2-46pk--D8rR6FRaWl3DxA) and she seemed to enjoy it. My bite of it combined with the wild rice revealed a nice combination of flavor. Definitely recommend it over the filet mignon.\n \nThe stars at Asia SF are the performers.

We came here on a Wednesday night so we were only required to make a minimum $25 purchase but out waitress kept pushing us for the $35 menage trios so we settled for that since I really wanted to try the ice cream that yelpers have been suggesting. Our appetizers were the sake steamed mussel (mediocre), blackened tuna sashimi (nothing to praise about), grilled shrimp and herb salad (must - try), and the ahi tuna burger (too much vinaigrette , don't get!) As for our main entree, we got the orange lamb, which tasted like any other braised meat to me with no distinctive flavoring to it. The crab cake was just average. One of our friends chose the soba noodles with truffle oil which was terrible and we ended up tossing away 3/4 of the plate. The salmon was probably the best choice and even came with black glutinous rice which made it a unique pairing. As for dessert, the miniature ice cream cone were really good especially the coconut flavored one. The drinks had so little alcohol, but I figured they did it on purpose so we would keep ordering more. We tried the lychee breeze, razzle dazzle, pussy cat, kiss, sex kitten .... which were all overwhelmingly sweet and lacked alcohol. Our bill came out to be 366.52 since gratuity was $75 already, but waitress kept telling me as I was signing the receipt to add tips for the performances... All in all, you're just paying for the shows here because the food was a huge disappointment and we ended up going to another restaurant afterwards to get a real meal.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-02-09"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with the blackened tuna sashimi, which was my favorite.

It's tender in the center and fresh, with a nice herbed crust that was just slightly peppery.  The Asia-dillas were good as usual, and the sundried cherry creme fraiche was a nice complement to the duck, but make sure you eat this warm.  The tamarind chicken satays are like any other chicken satay - done well, moist, chicken breast meat, with your standard peanut sauce.  The baby bok choy and shiitakes weren't too special, and they tasted like any other Chinese stir fry.  The grilled shrimp and herb salad was a nice cilantro salad with a sour vinaigrette with a nice kick.  I loved the crisped coconut and chopped peanuts, which added a nice crunch, but the shrimp was a bit overdone.\n\nOn to \"second courses.\"  Usually, I'm not a fan of lamb at all, but I always love their orange lamb.  The sauce is so good with rice and the taro chips, and I love the cucumber salad with it.  The miso glazed salmon has a subtle miso glaze, and it was cooked jst right.  The truffled soba noodles were a bit too oily this time, but I love the truffle scent and mushrooms and asparagus.  The ribs were pretty standard, nothing spectacular - just your usual honey tamarind glaze, but I couldn't taste the tamarind.\n\nAs for dessert, I loved the banana beignets with chocolate and butterscotch dipping sauces.  The banana beignets are crunchy on the outside, smooth/sweet inside, like a halved banana lumpia.  For the ice cream cones, the taro (purple) is my favorite; the other flavors are coconut and lychee.\n\nThe highlights are the performances (they are quite hot..) and birthday shots.  Girls take shots either from the chest, or between the legs (crotch shots).  They have lots of fruity cocktails, of which my favorites were the Jackie's razzledazzle and the sake cosmo.\n\nAfterwards, you can go downstairs, where there's a bar, a DJ, and a stripper pole.  It's pretty much all the diners from your sitting that go down there, but the music was good, and the bartenders are fun and let us do our own \"crotch shots\" among friends.\n\nParking isn't too bad, and it's pretty close to 101.  The area is a bit shady, and meter is free after 6pm (but $3/hour before that).  My only other complaint is that there are only 2 bathroom stalls.\n\nIt'll probably cost $70-100 per person with drinks, but it's a very unique experience.

They buzz your pager when everything is set and are shown to your seat. \n\nFood at Asia SF for groups is pre-fix. (There is an a la carte but may not make sense if you've got a crew.) You choose between 3 packages. Our group had the Platinum Group menu which had 9 items + 2 desserts for $48 pp. Note this is before the 20% gratuity and 4% health tax. And of course, doesn't include drinks. You are paying for dinner and show though.\n\nSo the layout of the evening is food and show, and more food and show. The 'ladies' double as the dancers. Super friendly sporting great bodies, and beautiful hair, guys in our group were definitely doing double takes. The sister to the emcee was especially cute.\n\nFood-wise, I was pleasantly surprised by the fusion cuisine. \n5 Appetizers - 1) Blackened Tuna Sashimi (pretty good, but had only a bite since there wasn't enough to go around), 2) Tamarind Chicken Satays (not dry which is good), 3) Asia-dilla (a duck quesadilla which was very tasty), 4) Baby Bok Choy & Shitake Mushroom (nice tender bok choy with sprinkling of mushroom), 5) Grilled Shrimp & Herb Salad (one of my favorites since the shrimp was freshly grilled and overall seasoning was a light thai sauce).\n\n4 Entrees - 1) Salmon (fish itself was typical but the red rice, tomato  and edamame it was served on gave nice texture), 2) Orange Lamb (very tender, not too gamey though I still don't like lamb in general, but was plated with sumono pickles which I love, and taro chips!),  3) Baby Back Ribs (very tasty and tender but requires eating with fingers), 4) Soba noodles (with asparagus and mushroom was ok).\n\n2 Desserts - 1) Mini ice cream cones in a variety of flavors - there were at least coconut, vanilla with nuts, ube, among others. 2) Banana Beignets, more like banana egg rolls which does come with chocolate or butterscotch dipping sauce. It was good but not excellent.\n\nHonestly what gives Asia SF a 4 star ranking is the show. The girls get up and perform on the bar, lip sync to a variety of popular songs, have a lot of fun with the choreography, and play with the audience. Among the more memorable acts was Simone who performed to Beyonce. She can really shake her booty. We were all laughing and having a great time.\n\nThe ladies will also come give blow job shots. Tucked in their ample decolletage, guys can take their shots mouth only. Lots of photo opps for sure.\n\nAnd there was good danceable music played throughout the night.

We stayed long enough to catch 2 shows even though the manager told us we could only catch one.  They gave us an hour and 45 minutes to eat and hang out, enough time to watch just one show, but we stayed a bit longer anyway.  It didn't surprise me that most of the trans-sexual performers were Filipino.  You can find them in great abundance if you visit Boracay in the Philippines.  The show was entertaining, but I wasn't impressed by the Caucasian performer.  I'm not being biased, but I think Filipino trans-sexuals practice a bit more, especially if they came from the Philippines; they have the tendency to be more flamboyant.\n\nThe highlight of my evening?

I had a friend from out of town come in, who originally introduced me to AsiaSF and thought this was THE BEST spot for a reunion. \n\nFrom the time you book to the time of the event, they treat you like royalty! When you arrive, you are taken downstairs to their lounge to drink and enjoy their inhouse DJ. Once dinner is ready, they check you in and take you to your table. Our serve was Nya Cruz and OH-EM-GEE, what an amazing girl! She was soooo personable, so fun, and so sweet. She took care of us all night. Knowing it was my birthday, she treated me to a BJ shot taken from between her legs LOL. \n\nIn my last review I talked about the food not being the best. OMG, what a complete difference. Remember that the 3-course meal will be about $49 and you choose from 7-8 items per course. Here's what I had this time: \n\n-1st Course: Blackened Tuna Sashimi with lemongrass beurre blanc and pickle vegetable salad. You get 6 slices of heaven, fresh tuna and some ginger on the side. Very flavorful and I liked the light beurre blanc under the tuna. Nice dipping sauce. \n\n-Main Course: Miso Glazed King Salmon, sauteed and finished with a miso glaze, served over black rice with a sweet tomato edamame salad. The miso wasn't as prominent but overall, OMG  loved it! A HUGE piece of salmon over lots of rice and the tomato edamame salad brought a refreshing taste. \n\n-Dessert Course: Asian pear and dried cherry spice route bread pudding served with whiskey hard sauce and whipped cream. Another BIG slice of heaven and SOOOO flavorful. What a great way to end the course. \n\nWOW, what an AH-MAZE-ING time. My birthday was celebrated in the most AH-MAZE-ING way with the most AH-MAZE-ING staff and entertainers.

We're talking long legs, toned, tanned, and big boobies. They are all insanely friendly to boot. \n\nWe got the Menage a Trois which is three course meal consisting of the first course, main course, then dessert all for $38. I started off with the sake steamed mussels. This was definitely a main course in terms of portion. I didn't want it to ruin my appetite before the main course even came but I tried my best and was only able to finish half of it. The mussels are served in a bowl of spicy red curry-kafir lime leaf broth. They provide you with mini-forks to use to fork out the mussels from the shells. They came off with so much ease it just made me that more excited to get down to business! The mussels were so juicy and it definitely brought the heat. The lime flavor was very strong. If you can't take spicy then this dish isn't for you. The garlic bread is also included inside the bowl. In my opinion, the two didn't go together but the bread was good nonetheless. \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Miso Glazed King Salmon. The sauteed miso glazed Pacific Salmon was served on top of a sweet tomato-edamame salad with this scary looking black rice sandwiched inbetween. The tomato-edamame salad tasted very fresh but it didn't have much flavor to it. Don't let the black rice scare you. It looks like wet rabbit poop but it is actually very tasty. I liked the idea of meshing the cold salad with the warm rice. It wasn't something my palette was used to. I don't normally order Salmon when I go out because most places cook it until the fish is dry and flakey. The fish was very moist and tender. The texture was almost like biting into a very tender piece of chicken.\n\nFor dessert, I got the warm chocolate cake which was a chocolate cake with a melted chocolate ganache filling. It's served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, topped with chocolate and butterscotch sauce. You also get a few raspberries. The chocolate was very rich and the chocolate filling makes it that much more sweeter. Now I understand why they serve it with vanilla bean. The chocolate can be too much so it's highly suggested that you eat it with the vanilla bean. \n\nTheir drinks are very strong and they all have dirty names to them. I think they name a drink after each \"lady\" that has worked there. I remember seeing some martini which may have had a woman's name and may have had the word bush in it. On top of this three course meal, you get a wonderfully entertaining show. Each lady will come out twice in their little costumes and dance across the bar with their selected song. Just the show alone is worth every penny that you're going to spend here. If you happen to come with a large party, you should definitely go downstairs and check out their club. \n\nOne cool tidbit: I won't have to go all the way up north for Asia SF anymore because they're going to open one up in Hollywood soon!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-21"}, {"excerpts": ["Main Course:\n- Miso Glazed King Salmon: baked just right but salty seasoning.

The week of the dinner, they send you a confirmation email, which you click to confirm your reservation.\n\nSo my husband and I finally redeemed the voucher last Sunday night. When my friend told me that there was plenty of parking, I thought that there was a parking garage nearby. Turns out that there was only street parking and since it was a Sunday, we didn't have to worry about the meters.\n\nMy husband and I were escorted by Scarlet (who is the new girl in AsiaSF) and we were seated at the bar. I ordered the grilled shrimp & herb salad, dungeness crab cakes and the banana beignet split. I was amused that the desserts were so Filipino. Even the trio of ice cream with the cone reminded my husband of those back in the Philippines. My husband ordered the mussels, miso glazed king salmon and a creme liqueur drink. Everything was great and we enjoyed every bite.\n\nSeating starts at 7:15pm on a Sunday then you order your food and drinks and have your first course before the first show at 8pm. Then after the show, you have your main course and dessert before the next show at 9pm. In between shows, the girls were giving shots to the birthday people in the room. It was hilarious. The performances were fun to watch, especially when they get someone to participate. I'm actually amazed that the girls could run in heels on that amount of bar space.\n\nThe day that we went, the place was packed. You enter the main room with the bar as soon as you get in.

No worries if you don't drink because the lady next to me doesn't drink so she wasn't given a shot. The bartenders were really nice and so were the girls. The girls were very entertaining.\n\nIn between shows, you can take pictures with the girls and the bartenders if you wish. Our total bill without the voucher was close to $100.

Both of their birthdays were this month, so I thought,  \"What better way to celebrate the occasion than a night out at AsiaSF!?\"\n\nThe plan was to have a nice dinner and a few drinks with just the three of us girls; but little did they know, I had a surprise up my sleeves! I planned for their boyfriends and a couple of close friends to surprise them at the dinner table and I am so very happy that it was a success!\n\nI basically made reservations for a party of eight, a month in advanced. It was an easy task using their online reservation system. I was able to choose the menu, time, and day that I wanted with no hassle whatsoever.\n\nThey had three different fixed party menus to choose from--gold, platinum, or diamond. The gold menu, which was $39/person, looked like a pretty hefty meal. I initially reserved for the gold menu, but when I called them two days before the event to confirm, they told me that...with the time slot that I chose, I would only be able to to choose the platinum ($49/person) or diamond ($59/person) menu. I did not understand why and honestly, I was pretty annoyed and hence the one star deduction. I know it's only a $10 difference, but it's really the principle of the matter. If I had not called, would they have informed me the day of the event? Was it some scheme to make more money? Well whatever the case, luckily my friends did not mind. We went with the platinum party menu, which included five first courses, four second courses, and two desserts. I will be blunt and say that the food was not very good. After all, you're really in a lounge/bar type of environment, so you can't expect five star dining. If I had to choose though, the only dishes that I liked were the miso glazed king salmon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=rsuV5sPwoYJ8WBUe5jKgMQ) and the Asia-dilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=k-P-9fHxzgYWnOtnLWMx8Q). The salmon was tender and perfectly cooked. The bed of sweet tomato-edamame salad was tangy and delicious!

Our entire party (men included) had a blast! We got to watch two shows and if I remember correctly, there were a total of eight or nine \"ladies\" who performed that night.

For our meal, we each ordered something different so we could try as many courses in our one trip. For the first course we ordered, the porcupines, the ahi burger, and the blackened tuna sashimi. The porcupines were excellent with the dipping sauce. My sister loved the sauce so much, she saved it for other dishes that came along later in the meal. The ahi burger was HUGE! I could've eatten it as my main course. It was delicious! The blackened tuna sashimi was also good, however it had a VERY strong pepper taste that gave it quite a kick.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the \"baby got back\" ribs, sansho spiced filet mignon, and the miso glazed king salmon.

The show was hilarious and quite amusing.

One from 7PM and another one at 9PM.

I started off with the Ahi Tuna Sliders; it was a whole burger that was cut in fours. Next was the ribs that I have to admit was hot and tasty! Then the dessert, how could I say no to that!? \n\nOur server for the night was black beauty diva \"Bionka\" not only was she gorgeous but she was so efficient and made sure that my table and the birthday girl was taken care of! Did I mention that she also is a great performer? Yes, the servers are also the performers and I have to admit that they sure know how to perform on that bar! I loved every minute of it!\n\nIs it your birthday? Well, I hate to spoil the surprise for you...but be prepared to take a lovely shot! Yes, after the performance, the server sits by you with a shot in between her legs and you have to grab it *only using your mouth* and swallow it all! *HAHA* what a delightful night! Nothing gets better than this!\n\nAfter your dinner you have the option of getting free access to their club downstairs and its free entry all night! Although, I was too full and excited about the dinner performance, I didn't get the chance to take advantage of the club scene so I have to come back and experience it!\n*PS-Friday/Saturday night dance club open until 2 AM.\n\nI would definitely encourage you to pick up the phone and make a reservation. This of the next big event or celebration you have and grab friends and celebrate here, you truly won't be disappointed.\n\nThank you AsiaSF for making my birthday the best I have had in a while!

This restaurant is the BEST place to celebrate, birthdays, anniversaries, first timers in Cali! Celebrate it all; just make sure you do it here! \n\nI had this place on my \"to-do\" list for a long time and I would have never thought I would have had the opportunity to come here to celebrate my birthday until my colleagues surprised me! My colleagues made reservations a week before the actual day. We came here on a Friday right when they opened which was 7PM and was able to grab a great seat by the window in the corner. \n\nAsiaSF offers two shows during the night. One from 7PM and another one at 9PM. This means that you have 2 hours to have the time of your life but be aware that all good things have to come to an end.\n\nThey also serve a dinner show menu for everyone no matter how small or big your party size is. The offer:\n*M\u00e9nage A Trios- 1-5 guest.  Choose: Any FIRST course, Any MAIN course, and any dessert or dessert drink.\n*Gold Package- 6 or more guests. Includes: nine delectable items with miniature ice cream cones for dessert.\n*Platinum Package-6 or more guests. Include: Eleven mouthwatering dishes including 2 desserts our most popular menu - a favorite for seafood lovers.\n*Diamond Package-6 or more guest include fourteen premium items including filet mignon, a Champagne toast & three desserts - the ultimate feast\n\nThe food was delicious and filling. I couldn't even it all of it! I wonder if that was because of all the excitement. Whatever it was...I enjoyed the food while I was devouring it. I started off with the Ahi Tuna Sliders; it was a whole burger that was cut in fours. Next was the ribs that I have to admit was hot and tasty! Then the dessert, how could I say no to that!? \n\nOur server for the night was black beauty diva \"Bionka\" not only was she gorgeous but she was so efficient and made sure that my table and the birthday girl was taken care of! Did I mention that she also is a great performer? Yes, the servers are also the performers and I have to admit that they sure know how to perform on that bar! I loved every minute of it!\n\nIs it your birthday? Well, I hate to spoil the surprise for you...but be prepared to take a lovely shot! Yes, after the performance, the server sits by you with a shot in between her legs and you have to grab it *only using your mouth* and swallow it all! *HAHA* what a delightful night! Nothing gets better than this!\n\nAfter your dinner you have the option of getting free access to their club downstairs and its free entry all night! Although, I was too full and excited about the dinner performance, I didn't get the chance to take advantage of the club scene so I have to come back and experience it!\n*PS-Friday/Saturday night dance club open until 2 AM.\n\nI would definitely encourage you to pick up the phone and make a reservation. This of the next big event or celebration you have and grab friends and celebrate here, you truly won't be disappointed.\n\nThank you AsiaSF for making my birthday the best I have had in a while!

I mean seriously where else are you going to find a place where you eat pretty good food while being entertained by beautiful trannies?  They are just fabulous.  Its hard to not stare and be like.. no it can't be.. is it? maybe?  how..? \n\nOf course I had heard so much about this place and so many other people have but have not gone.  Seriously if you have not come you need to.  Its perfect for a night out with girls catching up, bachelorette parties, or in my case my 25th Bday party dinner. \n\nThis place is much smaller than you think it is and its basically two floors.  Downstairs is the bar/club area where you can stay while waiting for your table or for after your dinner.  They have a bar down there with a bunch of bras hanging. haha.  So people leave this place bra-less? Interesting. \n\nSo to make sure the place wasn't booked and I got the ideal time of 7:30pm I called in 3 months ahead of time.  They are super great with reservations and completely understanding that with big parties it fluctuates.  I literally changed my reservation from 15 to 19 to 17 etc about 5 times and worked with Kim.  She was super nice about it.  I ended up with 17 people at my party. \n\nMy only qualm.. and me as in my friends is that its a bit pricey.  I totally think its worth it and know that its a once in a lifetime thing.  You wouldn't come to this type of thing all the time so thats why I wasn't bothered by it. \n\nSo its a pre-fix menu and you literally get everything on the menu.  I got a personalized menu too which was cute!  Will def keep for scrapbook purposes. haha. \n\nThey organized the dinner so well.. they bring the appetizers and everyone at the tables shares everything and their is def plenty of food.  Plenty of leftovers that we didn't bother taking home. \n\nSo the appetizers came first.. when we finished their was a performance of the \"girls\" lip synching with their hot bodes in scantliy clad clothes on the bar and then after then we got our entreees and got another performance by 4 \"girls.\" \n\nSo the food breakdown:  We had to get the Platinum menu because we were going on a Saturday evening so it was 48 bucks per person but plus tax 9.5% in SF and gratuity which is 20% its about 63ish bucks per person so I said 65 bucks. This is without drinks of course.  The drinks are yummy and they are about 10 bucks unless its wine so its like 8 or 9 bucks. \n\nPlatinum Feast:  \n- Tuna Sashimi (nice and fresh) \n- Asia Dilla- (very yummy and cheesy) \n- Chicken Satays (these were really DRY so maybe I had to douse it in sauce)\n- Baby Bok shoy and shitakes (great veggies for people that like it like me) \n- Grilled shrimp and herb salad (very seafoody- yum) \n\nEntree:\n- Orange lamb or tofu if you are vegetarian (got the lamb and it was tasty) \n- King Salmon (this was really good on a bed of black rice or something) \n- Soba Noodles (this was cold and grey and kinda odd- too soury for me) \n- Ribs (yum! fell of the bone so tender) \n\nDessert:\n- miniature ice cream cone that they put candles on for me to blow out!\n- Banana Beignet with chocolate and butterscotch sauce (SOO delicious- if I wasn't so full I'd eat more) \n\nBonus I got a blow job shot in between the legs of the \"women\" lol kinda freaky. \n\nAnyways I had a wonderful time.

On the corner of Howard and 9th is where you will find this not so hidden, \"hidden gem\", I mean as famous as this club/restaurant is, it still is not as well known as it should be. Whether you are a bay area native, of visiting from out of town, as long as you are looking for something different, a whole lot of fun, and have an open mind, a stop here is in order, trust me you will not regret it!!!

At $49/person for a show and dinner,I expected a good show and maybe mediocre tasting food at best. However the food was quite decent, the portions were fair size; there was a first course, second/main course, and \"of COURSE\", a very delicious dessert.  I tried the grilled shrimp & herb salad, the asia-dilla, sansho spiced filet mignon, and the pineapple cheesecake. They were all very delicious with the exception of the herb salad, I felt like I was eating straight cilantro, the shrimp was quite delicious as I cleared the salad of it. The asia-dilla was very tasty and flavorful, and the filet mignon was sliced, tender and better than most.  After dinner was time for dessert, the pineapple cheesecake was a piece of heaven, with a graham cracker crust, topped with delicious pineapple, swimming in a bed of strawberry sauce, and surrounded by pieces of fresh raspberries and blackberries, a great way to end the meal, and a great night.\n\nFirst Course: \nYour choice of; tamarind chicken satays, porcupines, asia-dilla, ahi burger, sesame steak salad, grilled shrimp & herb salad, blackened tuna sashimi, or sake steamed mussels.\n\nSecond Course:\nYour choice of; orange lamb (or tofu), miso glazed king salmon, dungeness crabcakes, \"baby got back\" ribs, sansho spiced filet mignon, or truffled soba noodles.\n\nDessert: \nYour choice of; arm chocolate cake, candied ginger rice pudding, banana beignet split, pineapple cheesecake, trio of miniature ice cream cones, or dessert drinks:\nJust Desserts Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e Cream Liqueur\nJust Desserts Thin Mint Chocolate Cookie Cream Liqueur\nJust Desserts Chocolate Chip Cookie Cream Liqueur\nFonseca Tawny Port from Portugal\nBV, Muscat de Beaulieu, Napa Valley\n\nThe show was even more enjoyable, these girls can break it down, and in heels on top of that (I know a lot of women who can't even WALK in heels, let alone dance in them!!). The atmosphere was electric as the crowd was very much into it, each performance kept you wanting more and more. The location is kind of small, but that works, because it created a more intimate and enjoyable environment. The bartenders and management were really hospitable and enjoyable, sitting at the bar I got to interact with them more and was given some shots from the bartender and manager for our birthday celebration, free shots!!! Always down for that. I left AsiaSF with a full, happy stomach, a slight buzz, and my jaw dropped, I mean this when I say it, I will definitely be back for more. \n\nReservations are easy, can be made by calling (415) 255-2742, booking via the www.asiaSF.com website, or on opentable.

Without a doubt, these men were SUPER HOT, but the performances wasn't exactly breath - taking. We came here on a Wednesday night so we were only required to make a minimum $25 purchase but out waitress kept pushing us for the $35 menage trios so we settled for that since I really wanted to try the ice cream that yelpers have been suggesting. Our appetizers were the sake steamed mussel (mediocre), blackened tuna sashimi (nothing to praise about), grilled shrimp and herb salad (must - try), and the ahi tuna burger (too much vinaigrette , don't get!) As for our main entree, we got the orange lamb, which tasted like any other braised meat to me with no distinctive flavoring to it. The crab cake was just average. One of our friends chose the soba noodles with truffle oil which was terrible and we ended up tossing away 3/4 of the plate. The salmon was probably the best choice and even came with black glutinous rice which made it a unique pairing. As for dessert, the miniature ice cream cone were really good especially the coconut flavored one.

It's a 2 hour seating limit starting from 7:15pm. I was suprisingly full after all the small plates were brought out. We had the $59 menu: crab cakes, champagne, potato cake with cavier on top, filet mignon, bok choy, tuna sashmi, soba noodles, salmon, and lamb. My faves were the lamb - surprisingly tender and flavorful; bok choy with shitake mushrooms, and the soba noodles - cold and a little bit vinegary but still good. I loved the dessert - miniature ice cream cones with taro ice cream or mango ice cream. There was also a banana flavored pastry dipped in chocolate sauce, and some small chocolate cakes (a little dry). But overall, the food was ok. \n\nI think people come here more for the atmosphere.

Entertainment, food, and drinks!  Who could ask for anything more?!  Not only was the show great but the food wasn't too shabby either.\n\nThe 'Tamarind Chicken Satay' (marinated chicken breast, skewered and grilled, served with Asia SF's spicy peanut sauce)  was a nice lite starter and the sauce was delicious.  The 'Porcupines' (shrimp, scallops & water chestnuts rolled in cellophane noodles, crisply fried & served with a plum wine/soy dipping sauce) and the 'Asia-dilla' (a quesadilla stuffed with duck, jack & manchego cheese, fresno peppers and scallions, with sun-dried cherry creme fraiche) were both good but neither overly memorable.  I thought the 'Sesame Steak Salad' (thinly sliced beef tenderloin seared and tossed in a sesame dressing, piled atop crisp greens, red onions, mint, and basil) was awesome-it was bright and full of flavor!  The 'Ahi Burger' (freshly ground pan seared ahi tuna, with a teriyaki glaze & horseradish-Chinese cabbage slaw on a focaccia roll) was also delicious, it tasted so fresh!\n\nMoving on......the 'Baby Got Back Ribs' (baby-back pork ribs, grilled with a honey-tamarind glaze, served with pickled carrots and japanese sweet potato crisps) & the 'Orange Lamb' (pieces of lamb sirloin sauteed in a mildly spiced orange sauce, served with coconut jasmine rice & thai cucumber salad) were the best!  The flavors were spot on.  The 'Truffled Soba Noodles' (grilled portobello mushroom & asparagus slices, tossed with cool sesame soba noodles, white truffle oil & scallion threads) were a little bland and not as tasty as the other dishes.\n\nAnd of course a meal would not be complete without 'Miniature Ice Cream Cones' (ube with toasted coconut, langka with sun-dried cherries, macapuno topped with candied peanuts) which were wonderful!\n\nNothing would have paired better with any of these dishes but a variety of cocktails!

When they found out that I didn't want to go, we were going to go somewhere else, but I convinced them that it was ok and in we went.\n\nThe whole establishment is quite small with the restaurant upstairs and the club downstairs. In the middle of the room is the bar (and the dance stage). We were seated and since we were a party of three, we were able to order the menage a trois. My sister and I ordered our drinks (I believe one of was pink kitten but I forgot the name of the other) which were sweet and delicious. For our meal, we each ordered something different so we could try as many courses in our one trip. For the first course we ordered, the porcupines, the ahi burger, and the blackened tuna sashimi. The porcupines were excellent with the dipping sauce. My sister loved the sauce so much, she saved it for other dishes that came along later in the meal. The ahi burger was HUGE! I could've eatten it as my main course. It was delicious! The blackened tuna sashimi was also good, however it had a VERY strong pepper taste that gave it quite a kick.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the \"baby got back\" ribs, sansho spiced filet mignon, and the miso glazed king salmon. The ribs were moist and very soft. The glaze was phenomenal!  The filet mignon was also cooked to perfection and the potato stars were the cutest things ever! It reminded us of the happy faced potatoes from the jelly belly factory. The salmon was juicy and very flavorful.\n\nThere were two \"ladies\" that we couldn't tell if they were real women or one of the \"ladies\" but when they stepped on stage for the show (the \"ladies\" dancing & lip syncing), that gave it away. Haha my bf was trying to figure it out the whole time prior the show. Man were those two a doozie! One of the \"ladies\" gave us a free shot of something really sweet and tasted yummie! The show was hilarious and quite amusing. My favorite was the last \"lady\" who sang \"Everyone's been F*ing but Me.\" One of the owners could be seen walking around talking to customers and refilling water. He looked like he was having a blast. He must really enjoy his company!\n\nBy dessert, I had enough alcohol so we stayed away from the dessert drinks. Yes, I'm a light weight but only recently! ^^;; Our \"waitress\" had highly recommended the warm chocolate cake (saying it was better than sex) so my sister ordered the dish. I ordered the banana beignet split while my bf ordered the trio of miniature ice cream cones.  The chocolate cake was moist and pretty good (tho I wouldnt say it was better than sex). The banana beignet was too big for me to finish alone (I didn't realize it was to serve two people in the first place) in addition to me being too gone to take in too much food/drink prior to the dessert even arriving.The miniature ice cream cones were so adorable and creamy.\n\nDefinitely will be returning with some unsuspecting friends! ^_^", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-01-07"}]}
