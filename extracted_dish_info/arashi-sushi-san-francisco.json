Tonight is the first time we stopped by this place, it was packed with a lot of people. We were sitting at the bar, we started off with the plum salmon sashimi, after the first bite of the salmon, I fell in love with this dish that I had to order another one. It's just so yummy. We also ordered the sunset roll , and the beef tataki. They all taste very good. Open sashimi order  was fresh off the boat.  \nThis place isn't too big, but very decent, they also have private room for party up to 14 ppl. I'm definitely  coming back to this place soon!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-10-03"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the plum salmon sashimi, tasted really unique cant describe it but its pretty amazing.

The interior is quite small but provided a really warm atmosphere also the music  they play there is nice too. I went in yesterday with my boyfriend we had some beer to start off with. The service was amazing, our waitress kept checking in on us and quick to punch in our order, most importantly she was smiley and didn't rush us when it past their closing time. Anyways we ordered some uni nigiri, which was really fresh no bitter taste to it it was sweet. We also ordered the regular oysters and oyster shooters. Im an oyster fanatic and i just wanna say they have like the most perfect size oysters ever (cause i like them tiny) even my boyfriend who doesn't eat oysters much ate a lot that day. We ordered the plum salmon sashimi, tasted really unique cant describe it but its pretty amazing. Btw the food came out pretty fast so im glad. We decided to order some sake midway of our dinner, even though theyre almost about to close they still let me which is a double plus plus ! Anyways ordered two rolls and also the hamachi carpaccio. The rolls has a nice presentation tasted fine no rice or the filling falling out. Aside from the oysters the hamachi carpaccio is my favorite! It was so fresh, flavorful, and melty , absolutely my favorite. I am definitely coming back here next time with pictures taken!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-01-31"}], "signature tray  rolls party": [], "nigiri tray  pcs party": [], "maki tray  rolls party": [], "ocean sunomono": [], "green tea cheesecake": [{"excerpts": ["The mochi ice cream was very chewy tastes really weird wouldn't order it but besides that everything was amazing especially the green tea cheesecake!
