Both were delicious, flavorful and portion size matched the price. Ban chon was very good. Rice and noodles were fresh. \n\nYou have a choice of cocobang and 707 in the immediate area and i would easily choose Zzan. Cocobang was good but not memorable (save for the long wait) and my one experience at 707 was unfriendly, overpriced and bulgogi was near-beef jerky dry. Seriously, it felt like the leftover bulgogi from the grill. I will say their seafood pancake was good.\n\nI don't go to restaurants twice unless I had an exceptional experience.
