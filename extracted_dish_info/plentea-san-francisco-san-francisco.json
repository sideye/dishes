Unlike the other places, it is open late, which has got me here a couple of times. The menu here is simple consisting of Classic Milk Teas, Special Milk Teas, Cold Brewed Teas, Ice Blended Drinks and Hot Teas. For milk you have options for both dairy (Clover whole and half-and-half) and non-dairy (Silk Soy and Califia Almond). For toppings you have boba, aloe, grass jelly, lychee jelly, chia seeds and egg pudding (50c each). Sweetness can be customized to your liking (100%, 50%, 25% or 0%). It seems to cross all boxes as far as options are concerned.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their Classic and Special Milk teas. One thing that distinguishes Plentea from other boba tea places is their insistence on using glass bottles instead of plastic cups, supposedly to help the environment. In today age when you can get fully compostable cups and straws, insisting on using glass bottles for protecting the environment is just wrong. Let's call it what it is, a marketing ploy that positions Plentea differently from their competitors. Goes without saying I am not a fan of these glass bottles as they feel heavy and makes holding the drink painful. I would prefer if they give you a choice of getting a glass bottle rather than palming them off on everyone. Anyway let's move on to the drinks.\n\nThe short and simple review would be that their drinks are good not great. It took a little trial and error to get to my customization right here. I started by getting my drinks 50% sweet, but found that for my taste I needed their regular sweetness (but that would be a little sweet for most people). Then I replaced whole milk with half-and-half as whole milk tended to undermine the tea taste and lastly getting less ice prevented the teas from becoming diluted with time.\n\nFrom the drinks that I've tried, I like their Jasmine Green tea and Nutella Milk Tea. The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. What I didn't like was the Matcha Latte. It was pretty weak and needed a lot more Matcha powder to give it the bitter sweet finish.\n \nMost of the teas are just under the $5 mark which with toppings will put you about $6 a cup give or take, which is in line with what you would pay at the fancy Boba Guys but 10% more than what you would pay at i-Tea just a block down. In my pecking order for Boba tree places in FiDi (or at-least the ones that I've been to) Plentea lies in the middle of i-Tea and Boba Guys, with i-Tea on top and Boba Guys at the bottom. During normal hours I prefer to go to i-Tea and end up coming to Plentea only for a late night boba fix.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-07-30"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the sea salt crema coffee and jasmine green tea with tapioca balls. \n\n"], "author": "Holly A.", "review": "Wow I love the clean look inside this spot.

Obviously this was so I could more fairly compare it to Bottle Zup, which is a very similar boba shop. I also wanted to go running, but needed a motivator, so obviously the solution was to make a bubble tea shop the destination and boba my reward.\n\nUnfortunately (for those who may have been pedestrians between my apartment and Plentea), I did not have the opportunity to run over a mile back home carrying a bottle full of boba in one hand and a bubble tea straw and my phone in the other, as I did when I visited Bottle Zup. This is partly because I was feeling lazy and the Montgomery Muni stop is nearby, and partly because Plentea only gives a plastic cap to cover the bottle, and I was afraid it wouldn't hold up under the stress of my running home.\n\nAs for the drink itself, the boba had a nice chewy consistency to it and was slightly sweet, but I am not a fan of the matcha latte. It wasn't too sweet, but the blend tastes more like jasmine green milk tea than matcha, but I am not a fan of the super-blended, mild-tasting matcha. I like my matcha strongly-flavored and textured, so this didn't quite hit the right note.\n\nThis place is pretty overpriced--I paid nearly $6 for my drink after tax, and had to pay in cash ($10 credit card minimum) which is a pain because it meant that I had to carry cash there while running and carry change back! The glass bottle is sturdy and slightly bigger than the one from Bottle Zup, but even if I bring it back for the 10% discount, I'm not sure it's worth it. I like the novelty of the glass bottle, but you could easily get the same for slightly better tea at Bottle Zup.

The last time (and first time) I came, it was quite crowded with music pumping. It's nice to a peaceful and calm vibe sometimes at boba places but I'd rather it be more alive...ESPECIALLY on a Saturday. \n\nThere isn't PLENTEA enough of drinks to choose from their menu but still enough choices to pick out a drink. They offer milk teas such as Jasmine, Roasted Oolong, and Earl grey. Plentea also has hot drinks such as Hot Oolong milk tea and cold brewed teas (Peach oolong, Premium mountain oolong, etc). They're are mostly known (in terms of drinks) for their Sea Salt Creama which I recommend to those who haven't tried it yet. I'm not a huge fan of Taro Milk tea but for all those Taro lovers out there, Plentea doesn't offer Taro Milk tea.\n\nThe guy who took our order was very quick and attentive. He was really informative by letting us know that the sweetness of their Thai tea cannot be adjusted. Kindly, he offered us a sample to see if it was too sweet for my mom's liking. Once we got our drinks, the person who made my drink even asked me to tell him if I needed more sugar in my Jasmine Milk tea!

Can I just say, Thank you Plentea very MATCHA for that Jasmine Milk Tea. It was definitely one of the best Jasmine Milk Tea I've ever tasted in my mouth. The tea was just as strong as the amount of half and half they put in. The creaminess of the half & half and the brewed taste of the Jasmine was just BOOOOOM. They also put in the matcha in front of you if you order the Matcha milk tea which creates a cool ombr\u00e9 mixed effect. That adds on even more to this Tea place that just shouts aesthetic. \n\nThe guy who took my order was even considerate enough to ask me if I wanted whole milk or half and half with my Jasmine Milk Tea.

Unlike the other places, it is open late, which has got me here a couple of times. The menu here is simple consisting of Classic Milk Teas, Special Milk Teas, Cold Brewed Teas, Ice Blended Drinks and Hot Teas. For milk you have options for both dairy (Clover whole and half-and-half) and non-dairy (Silk Soy and Califia Almond). For toppings you have boba, aloe, grass jelly, lychee jelly, chia seeds and egg pudding (50c each). Sweetness can be customized to your liking (100%, 50%, 25% or 0%). It seems to cross all boxes as far as options are concerned.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their Classic and Special Milk teas. One thing that distinguishes Plentea from other boba tea places is their insistence on using glass bottles instead of plastic cups, supposedly to help the environment. In today age when you can get fully compostable cups and straws, insisting on using glass bottles for protecting the environment is just wrong. Let's call it what it is, a marketing ploy that positions Plentea differently from their competitors. Goes without saying I am not a fan of these glass bottles as they feel heavy and makes holding the drink painful. I would prefer if they give you a choice of getting a glass bottle rather than palming them off on everyone. Anyway let's move on to the drinks.\n\nThe short and simple review would be that their drinks are good not great. It took a little trial and error to get to my customization right here. I started by getting my drinks 50% sweet, but found that for my taste I needed their regular sweetness (but that would be a little sweet for most people). Then I replaced whole milk with half-and-half as whole milk tended to undermine the tea taste and lastly getting less ice prevented the teas from becoming diluted with time.\n\nFrom the drinks that I've tried, I like their Jasmine Green tea and Nutella Milk Tea. The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. What I didn't like was the Matcha Latte. It was pretty weak and needed a lot more Matcha powder to give it the bitter sweet finish.\n \nMost of the teas are just under the $5 mark which with toppings will put you about $6 a cup give or take, which is in line with what you would pay at the fancy Boba Guys but 10% more than what you would pay at i-Tea just a block down. In my pecking order for Boba tree places in FiDi (or at-least the ones that I've been to) Plentea lies in the middle of i-Tea and Boba Guys, with i-Tea on top and Boba Guys at the bottom.

Obviously this was so I could more fairly compare it to Bottle Zup, which is a very similar boba shop. I also wanted to go running, but needed a motivator, so obviously the solution was to make a bubble tea shop the destination and boba my reward.\n\nUnfortunately (for those who may have been pedestrians between my apartment and Plentea), I did not have the opportunity to run over a mile back home carrying a bottle full of boba in one hand and a bubble tea straw and my phone in the other, as I did when I visited Bottle Zup. This is partly because I was feeling lazy and the Montgomery Muni stop is nearby, and partly because Plentea only gives a plastic cap to cover the bottle, and I was afraid it wouldn't hold up under the stress of my running home.\n\nAs for the drink itself, the boba had a nice chewy consistency to it and was slightly sweet, but I am not a fan of the matcha latte. It wasn't too sweet, but the blend tastes more like jasmine green milk tea than matcha, but I am not a fan of the super-blended, mild-tasting matcha. I like my matcha strongly-flavored and textured, so this didn't quite hit the right note.\n\nThis place is pretty overpriced--I paid nearly $6 for my drink after tax, and had to pay in cash ($10 credit card minimum) which is a pain because it meant that I had to carry cash there while running and carry change back! The glass bottle is sturdy and slightly bigger than the one from Bottle Zup, but even if I bring it back for the 10% discount, I'm not sure it's worth it. I like the novelty of the glass bottle, but you could easily get the same for slightly better tea at Bottle Zup.

I realize this is because they probably use powder, or because their tapioca comes from some questionable source, who knows. With Plentea's drink offerings, it tasted clean and like real tea and milk, which is something I appreciate a lot and I'm willing to pay the premium if I know what I'm drinking is not powder. I can even see the staff make my drink in front of me, which is more reassuring than the places that have someone take my order, disappear into the back, and come back with my drink. \n\nI've had here the Thai milk tea, Nutella milk tea, and the roasted oolong milk tea.

", "The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. "], "author": "Ahmad J.", "review": "Plentea is another popular Boba Milk Tea place in FiDi. Unlike the other places, it is open late, which has got me here a couple of times. The menu here is simple consisting of Classic Milk Teas, Special Milk Teas, Cold Brewed Teas, Ice Blended Drinks and Hot Teas. For milk you have options for both dairy (Clover whole and half-and-half) and non-dairy (Silk Soy and Califia Almond). For toppings you have boba, aloe, grass jelly, lychee jelly, chia seeds and egg pudding (50c each). Sweetness can be customized to your liking (100%, 50%, 25% or 0%). It seems to cross all boxes as far as options are concerned.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their Classic and Special Milk teas. One thing that distinguishes Plentea from other boba tea places is their insistence on using glass bottles instead of plastic cups, supposedly to help the environment. In today age when you can get fully compostable cups and straws, insisting on using glass bottles for protecting the environment is just wrong. Let's call it what it is, a marketing ploy that positions Plentea differently from their competitors. Goes without saying I am not a fan of these glass bottles as they feel heavy and makes holding the drink painful. I would prefer if they give you a choice of getting a glass bottle rather than palming them off on everyone. Anyway let's move on to the drinks.\n\nThe short and simple review would be that their drinks are good not great. It took a little trial and error to get to my customization right here. I started by getting my drinks 50% sweet, but found that for my taste I needed their regular sweetness (but that would be a little sweet for most people). Then I replaced whole milk with half-and-half as whole milk tended to undermine the tea taste and lastly getting less ice prevented the teas from becoming diluted with time.\n\nFrom the drinks that I've tried, I like their Jasmine Green tea and Nutella Milk Tea. The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. What I didn't like was the Matcha Latte. It was pretty weak and needed a lot more Matcha powder to give it the bitter sweet finish.\n \nMost of the teas are just under the $5 mark which with toppings will put you about $6 a cup give or take, which is in line with what you would pay at the fancy Boba Guys but 10% more than what you would pay at i-Tea just a block down. In my pecking order for Boba tree places in FiDi (or at-least the ones that I've been to) Plentea lies in the middle of i-Tea and Boba Guys, with i-Tea on top and Boba Guys at the bottom.

It wasn't crazy sweet like the ice milk in Tea Society nor was it bland. It was sweet enough for me to finish the whole bottle and not feel sick after. \n\nDefinitely will be back and this time i want to try the Nutella Milk Tea and their flavor milk (strawberry, mango, etc).

It seems to cross all boxes as far as options are concerned.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their Classic and Special Milk teas. One thing that distinguishes Plentea from other boba tea places is their insistence on using glass bottles instead of plastic cups, supposedly to help the environment. In today age when you can get fully compostable cups and straws, insisting on using glass bottles for protecting the environment is just wrong. Let's call it what it is, a marketing ploy that positions Plentea differently from their competitors. Goes without saying I am not a fan of these glass bottles as they feel heavy and makes holding the drink painful. I would prefer if they give you a choice of getting a glass bottle rather than palming them off on everyone. Anyway let's move on to the drinks.\n\nThe short and simple review would be that their drinks are good not great. It took a little trial and error to get to my customization right here. I started by getting my drinks 50% sweet, but found that for my taste I needed their regular sweetness (but that would be a little sweet for most people). Then I replaced whole milk with half-and-half as whole milk tended to undermine the tea taste and lastly getting less ice prevented the teas from becoming diluted with time.\n\nFrom the drinks that I've tried, I like their Jasmine Green tea and Nutella Milk Tea. The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. What I didn't like was the Matcha Latte. It was pretty weak and needed a lot more Matcha powder to give it the bitter sweet finish.\n \nMost of the teas are just under the $5 mark which with toppings will put you about $6 a cup give or take, which is in line with what you would pay at the fancy Boba Guys but 10% more than what you would pay at i-Tea just a block down. In my pecking order for Boba tree places in FiDi (or at-least the ones that I've been to) Plentea lies in the middle of i-Tea and Boba Guys, with i-Tea on top and Boba Guys at the bottom.

Generally, Plentea isn't my number one option, but I needed another one of their cute jars after mine had broken so that took me and my friend here!\n\nI think San Francisco has at least 2 different Plentea locations, and the one on Kearny was the closest one to us. Unfortunately, the parking here is especially horrendous since it's between Chinatown and the financial district, so you may have to loop around a few times or double park.\n\nBut after you find parking, you'll walk into a different world, a more beautiful world without walls separating people~ Plentea is known for its aesthetics and you see it right when you pass through the door. There's beautiful lights all around the ceiling and walls, there's cute plants on shelves, and the atmosphere is overall cute and welcoming.\n\nSo how do the drinks stack up? Plentea has your average assortment of boba drinks; they stick with what's popular like jasmine milk tea, oolong, and black milk tea as well as matcha. When we came here, my friend got the original milk tea and I got the oolong. Pro tip: do not swap out the milk base when you order; I've heard it doesn't taste was good. \n\nDrinks came out a few minutes later in their cute jars, and after taking our instagram pictures, we dug in. My friend loved her milk tea and thought the boba was amazing. I'm a huge fan of oolong and thought that my drink was good, but watered down and a bit too sugary. However, I finished that thing quick cause it was still good! \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this Plentea. The tea was okay even though mine was way too sweet because the taste was decent and the price was not bad for the fact that you get to KEEP THE JAR!!!, but I wouldn't come here above other places in the Bay.

My mistaken Oolong Milk Tea was pretty tasty but it wasn't what I wanted. 50% Sweet was sufficient; 75% Sweetness is probably my max (25% - 100% Sweetness level offered).

Google maps actually got the directions wrong (wanted me to go on the behind street) and I eerily missed it because where Plentea is located, there are no streetlights there and it looks dark as hell.

They had the glass bottles available even after a full day of orders on a Saturday. You'd expect them to be out. \n\nHmm maybe that's why they looked closed so they don't have sell to more customers. Just kidding. We took the bottle caps for our three drinks and some straws and headed back to the car. The green milk tea was a delivery for another friend and she said it was good.

He claimed it was, \"the best milk tea evarrrrr\" to which he continues with its better than a lot of places he has been too. \n\nCurious I tried mine, as I went for the Thai Tea with egg pudding.

Quite wonderful.\n\nAs much as this place makes it to one of my top spots in milk tea spots, I really hope it wasn't just a fluke when I went in that evening and it tasted good. \n\nIt looks like they take all major credit cards but have an outrageous 15 dollar minimum.

So I had the Sea Salt Crema Oolong w/ Egg pudding and I LOVED my drink. The crema was really smooth and creamy and didn't have too much salt. The egg pudding had a good consistency as well. One of my friends also liked my drink more than hers. The bad thing is that they are not consistent in their drinks. One of the Brown Sugar Ice Milk was more watery while the other was more sweet. The person that had the more watered down drink didn't care for his while the girl who had the more sweet drink enjoyed hers. The tapioca pearls were soft and not overly chewy so that's a plus. Fairly pricey but so yummy!\n\nNote: If you don't want your drink in the glass bottles, you get a 10% discount off the drink prices and get your drinks in a plastic cup instead. You also get the same discount if you bring the bottle back", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-28"}, {"excerpts": ["hey, now you are part of the trend drinking your milk tea in a glass bottle.

It was almost 90 degrees, my boyfriend was grumpy, hot and Yelp directions were leading us everywhere, so I knew that the only thing that could alleviate this situation was a nice cold glass on boba. When we finally got to Plentea, we were told by some guy on their second floor balcony that they were closed and that their grand opening is tomorrow, which I found odd because the store was open, pretty much looked ready to go, and there were 5 Yelp reviews raving about their boba. Disappointed, we took our business to Ten Ren a couple blocks up from Plentea.\n\nA day after their grand opening, my sister and I went to try their boba.

I went with their peach black tea with boba, and my friends got the sea salt crema with boba, and the peach oolong tea with lychee jelly.\n\nThe way their fresh fruit tea drinks work is that they're basically whatever tea you choose (black, green, or oolong), with minced pieces of your choice of fruit (mango, peach, honeydew, etc.).  The fruit flavor really isn't fully infused into the drink in the way that you might get from a syrup or powder, but then again, you get the benefit of knowing you've got fresh fruit in there.  The peaches were not ripe, though, so the bits and pieces were crunchy and super tart.  You win some, you lose some, I guess.  Between my black tea base, and one of my friends' oolong tea base, I'd probably try and go with the oolong, or maybe even green, next time.  The black tea almost overpowered the peach flavor, while the oolong nicely complimented it.  As for the sea salt crema... blech.  I've never been on that bandwagon, though, so take my comment with a grain of, er, salt...\n\nStill love the glasses here!

Well at least for me it did :P \nPlus it's environmentally friendly that way!\nYou can bring back the bottle next time for 20% off your drink. \n(Which I think is kind of a hassle to bring back and forth.. But it shouldn't be so bad if you have a bag with you :P)\n\nThe price is however.. overpriced.. At first I was willing to pay $6 for a drink because I get to keep the bottle, I would love to come back again to try all the flavors but I don't know if I want to pay like $5 for drink since it's just milk/tea.. Even if it's 20% off, it's still pricy. I don't think this should be more/as expensive than Jamba Juice or Starbucks.. :/\n\nThe workers there were very nice, and it's a pretty nice place to chill at. There are two floors to this place. \nBut overall, my experience was great. My only problem is the price.\n\n----- Update -----\n\nThe second time I went, I ordered Mango Oolong Milk Tea. They didn't really know how to make it but try tried anyway. It didn't taste good this time... There was way to much powder and my drink was warm..

They advise you to not stir it in until you try each of the components separately. The tea is lightly sweetened and good on its own. But the sweet creme is truly amazing.

I give them 2 stars for the average milk teas and nice chewy bobas with a nice bottle.

Rounded up 4 other friends, so that we could carpool to SF just to try this new place, as well as get the bottle.  I read one of the earlier reviews, saying they arrived just before they opened since there is a limited supply of bottle to get one, and originally that was the goal, but two of my friends had a slight time conflict, and we ended up showing up around 12:45.  The whole way there I was actually semi-stressed because it's about a 40 minute drive from where I live, so I was like WHAT IF WE DROVE ALL THIS WAY AND WE GET NO BOTTLES. But, praise the lord, they still had bottle when we arrived haha.  I'm guessing because it was a Sunday that parking was extremely easy to find.  I parked pretty much outside the shop, and then walked in.  The decor was fairly modern looking, and there is an upstairs. However, I immediately notice a few drawbacks about the decor.  Somewhat tight, but it's SF, so what can you do, but this led to all the tables on the first floor seating only 2 individuals, so for a group of 5, we took up 3 tables.  Also, I had no freaking clue that to the right of the register was a huge chalkboard that had FOOD ITEMS.  I was so busy looking forward at the drink menu, that I never noticed this.  Such a shame because some of the items sounded really exciting.  I also believe none of my friends noticed the food menu either.  Since I commuted so far, I went what the hell, I might as well get several bottles... LOL. So I decided to try three different drinks.  I got the iced milk with brown sugar and pudding,  the green milk tea with pearls, and a strawberry smoothie with pearls.  All came out pretty quickly, and I was actually extremely satisfied with all 3 drinks.  The level of sweetness is pretty good. It's just sweet enough that you can still taste the drink flavor and flavor from the pearls, but not overly sweet.  Although I really do enjoy the drinks, the price was a little bit steeper than I expected.  Granted I knew I'd be paying for the bottle, but if I were to just get it in a plastic cup, it's 20% off, but most of these drinks were 5$ or more, so that's only about a dollar off, and I think the plastic cup size is 12oz, so yup quite steep.

My Thai tea seemed to be heavy on the milk part but nonetheless good. Tapioca was chewy and not hard like other places. The one thing I didn't really like to much about Plentea, is the price of their drinks. A usual milk tea shouldn't be $4 almost $5, but I guess you are actually paying for a glass bottle too. Overall, everything was good, customer service needs some work but other than that, they are a good boba place with a novelty jar to take home!", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-08-03"}, {"excerpts": ["A very good boba milk tea place in the FD."], "author": "William N.", "review": "A very good boba milk tea place in the FD.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Finally a milk tea place in the FiDi.

Unlike the other places, it is open late, which has got me here a couple of times. The menu here is simple consisting of Classic Milk Teas, Special Milk Teas, Cold Brewed Teas, Ice Blended Drinks and Hot Teas. For milk you have options for both dairy (Clover whole and half-and-half) and non-dairy (Silk Soy and Califia Almond). For toppings you have boba, aloe, grass jelly, lychee jelly, chia seeds and egg pudding (50c each). Sweetness can be customized to your liking (100%, 50%, 25% or 0%). It seems to cross all boxes as far as options are concerned.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their Classic and Special Milk teas. One thing that distinguishes Plentea from other boba tea places is their insistence on using glass bottles instead of plastic cups, supposedly to help the environment. In today age when you can get fully compostable cups and straws, insisting on using glass bottles for protecting the environment is just wrong. Let's call it what it is, a marketing ploy that positions Plentea differently from their competitors. Goes without saying I am not a fan of these glass bottles as they feel heavy and makes holding the drink painful. I would prefer if they give you a choice of getting a glass bottle rather than palming them off on everyone. Anyway let's move on to the drinks.\n\nThe short and simple review would be that their drinks are good not great. It took a little trial and error to get to my customization right here. I started by getting my drinks 50% sweet, but found that for my taste I needed their regular sweetness (but that would be a little sweet for most people). Then I replaced whole milk with half-and-half as whole milk tended to undermine the tea taste and lastly getting less ice prevented the teas from becoming diluted with time.\n\nFrom the drinks that I've tried, I like their Jasmine Green tea and Nutella Milk Tea. The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. What I didn't like was the Matcha Latte. It was pretty weak and needed a lot more Matcha powder to give it the bitter sweet finish.\n \nMost of the teas are just under the $5 mark which with toppings will put you about $6 a cup give or take, which is in line with what you would pay at the fancy Boba Guys but 10% more than what you would pay at i-Tea just a block down. In my pecking order for Boba tree places in FiDi (or at-least the ones that I've been to) Plentea lies in the middle of i-Tea and Boba Guys, with i-Tea on top and Boba Guys at the bottom.

Obviously this was so I could more fairly compare it to Bottle Zup, which is a very similar boba shop. I also wanted to go running, but needed a motivator, so obviously the solution was to make a bubble tea shop the destination and boba my reward.\n\nUnfortunately (for those who may have been pedestrians between my apartment and Plentea), I did not have the opportunity to run over a mile back home carrying a bottle full of boba in one hand and a bubble tea straw and my phone in the other, as I did when I visited Bottle Zup. This is partly because I was feeling lazy and the Montgomery Muni stop is nearby, and partly because Plentea only gives a plastic cap to cover the bottle, and I was afraid it wouldn't hold up under the stress of my running home.\n\nAs for the drink itself, the boba had a nice chewy consistency to it and was slightly sweet, but I am not a fan of the matcha latte. It wasn't too sweet, but the blend tastes more like jasmine green milk tea than matcha, but I am not a fan of the super-blended, mild-tasting matcha. I like my matcha strongly-flavored and textured, so this didn't quite hit the right note.\n\nThis place is pretty overpriced--I paid nearly $6 for my drink after tax, and had to pay in cash ($10 credit card minimum) which is a pain because it meant that I had to carry cash there while running and carry change back! The glass bottle is sturdy and slightly bigger than the one from Bottle Zup, but even if I bring it back for the 10% discount, I'm not sure it's worth it. I like the novelty of the glass bottle, but you could easily get the same for slightly better tea at Bottle Zup. The one thing Plentea does have going for it is that it stays open so late (until 11pm) which is super convenient in a city where so many places (specifically boba places) close so early.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-06-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Unfortunately, I got the matcha latte with almond milk/boba with reg sweetness and I could not taste any matcha nor any other taste.
