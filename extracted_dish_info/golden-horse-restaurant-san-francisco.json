I ordered my usual items.  \nA small bowl of clear stock.  The usual sprinkling of green onion was missing.  The stock was lukewarm and smelled of pig's trotters and tasted strongly of MSG.                                                                                   .                                                                                                     I worked in many good Chinese restaurants.  The lukewarm  broth's lack of garnish and taste, was the lazy young cook.  \nHe put in frozen pork bones and too much MSG in the stock pot.  He didn't reboil the broth.  This can sicken you...or worse.  \n\nEvery Chinese restaurant uses MSG in the stock.  Why else is a bowl of MSG near the stock pot?                                                              .                                                                                                         The appetizer dish was salt and pepper chicken wings.  No color from being cooked in cooling oil.  Most bones were reddish and the meat rubbery.  \n\nThe garnish was burnt granulated re-hydrated garlic and mushy green onion...no hot green pepper.                                                       .                                                                                                     The last dish was beef with broccoli.  The sauce was watery with undissolved starch/soy sauce globules stuck to the otherwise OK boiled broccoli.  \nThe beef was barely cooked and cold.                                                               .                                                                                                      Everything came at once.  The total kitchen staff alternated hanging out in the dining room 1 table away from me.  Lookouts for the owner, no doubt.  \n\nMy waitresses, who remembered me, never asked how my meal was.

I mean raising the ceiling height and adding crown molding - that is unheard of detailing from a chinese restaurant.  Although the room is not that expansive, you don't feel 'crowded'.  This will give you a clue into Aspect #3.\n\nAspect #2 - Excellent menu selections from typical to the more exotic jellyfish, quail.  However, go to the inside back cover of the menu and choose from 4 preset family dinners ranging from $25.80 - $56.80 and you can't make a mistake here...the portions are not so puny that you have to request double portions.  We attended after a memorial and had two tables and our table had 5 adults and one teenager and we still boxed up 3 takeaways with leftovers.  See below for the family menu we selected.\n\nAspect #3 - One would think and assume that at $32.80 for 6 perfectly cooked and seasoned dishes ($5.47 per dish), it would be portioned for a party of 3 but as I stated in #2, they do not do that.  Plus, my comment about their detailing of the dining room extends to their detailing of the way the food is actually presented on each dish.  I would be easier to tip the wok of perfectly cooked vegetables onto a plate and ring the bell to serve, but they actually took the time to arrange the greens in a circular pattern and the seafood (prawns, squid & mushrooms) add to the overall color of the dish.  Each dish showed the same level of detailing which only adds to an overall positive experience - Bravo!\n\n$32.80 gives you \nSliced pork, salted egg w/ mustard green soup - Very tasty and not too salty.\n\nSpicy salt baked spareribs - similar to salt pepper pork chops, again not over seasoned.\n\nDouble seafood with tender greens = very good presentation\n\nBeef stew and tofu in a clay pot = very yummy and temperature hot\n\nPan fried flounder = crispy and golden, no hint of oil that has 10,000 hours of work.\n\nChinese broccoli (guy lon) with oyster sauce = tender and deep green\n\nI wasn't disappointed that a light dessert did not come with this dinner.\n\nService was excellent and friendly.  \n\nCheck Golden Horse out especially if you haven't been there in the past two years.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-09-06"}], "shredded pork": [], "steamed pork hash": [], "steamed stuffed bean curd": [], "deep fried stuffed bean curd": [{"excerpts": ["Deep Fried Stuffed Bean Curd ($6.75) - Another favorite of mine, especially when it's sauced up.

We also had steamed rice, so it wasn't as popular as it could have been if the steam one never showed up.\n\n* Deep Fried Stuffed Bean Curd ($6.75) - Another favorite of mine, especially when it's sauced up.  Good with white rice.\n\n* Steamed Fish - It was on the smaller side of life, which barely fed our family.\n\n* Pork Ribs - I usually skip this, especially the wet ones.  There's usually too much other stuff I'd rather get my fingers on.  \n\n* Long Life Noodles - A big surprise for all of us.  Usually bland and something that you order just because, it was surprisingly good.  Everyone was eating this up and no leftovers here!\n\n* Dessert was red bean soup.  Again, not a favorite of mine and always gets skipped.\n\nOverall, we had a lot of food and a few boxes of leftovers.  Prices were decent and service was just alright.  My family seems to be somewhat pleased with this place because they've been going there a lot in the past few months, so it works.  \n\nI did take photos of some of the dishes before my family members got their chopsticks into it!  Some of the dishes may have been doubled to accommodate our hearty eaters.\n\nUpdate! 05/4/08 - Went back for dinner last night and tried a few other dishes.\n\n* Soup with egg, corn, calamari?, and some other stuff -  Pretty good, I don't know exactly what kind of soup it was, but you can check the pictures to see for yourself.\n\n* Peking Duck - Fatty chunks of duck meat.  They still use the big buns with the red stamp on it!\n\n* Steamed Chicken with Ginger & Scallion Sauce (Half $7.50) - It tastes so good with the sauce!  Ask for extra sauce so you can slather your chicken with it!\n\n* Deep fried fish with snap peas - The fish was a bit dry, it needed some dipping sauce to give it a kick.  \n\n* Dessert was different this time - a coconut based hot sweet soup that was yummy and had us asking for more!  Definitely better than that red bean crap!", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-02-15"}], "combination seafood on hot iron platters": [], "beef stew in clay pot": [], "taro  stewed pork in clay pot": [], "mixed vegetable deluxe": [], "szechuan vegetables  tofu": [], "green": [{"excerpts": ["Chow fun with black bean, westlake beef soup, tomato beef cried chow mein, green beans, and pork ribs.\n\n"], "author": "Erik H.", "review": "My mom likes to take the family here.

So if you are looking for Panda Express or the type of place that you can get chicken chow mein or sweet sour chicken, you will not be happy.  This place is for the authentic chinese taste for those that immigrated to SF many years ago, or really know family style cooking, Chinese American style....\n\n1.  Ambiance - What can I say, this is a small place and drafty as well.  The decor is decidely inexpensive and well, the best chinese places have the worst restrooms, so this place is pretty darn good as far as chinese food goes, which means the restrooms are........\n\n2.  Banquet Size tables - They have three of the large size tables that can seat 8-10 easily. Big Lazy Susan for moving the food around, this makes for a perfect family get together.\n\n3.  The food - Here we go.  This is a chinese restaurant which means that you will find the service to be sub par according to western taste and perhaps abrupt.\n\na.  Fixed Menu - They have three fixed menu for 27.00, 36.00 or 57.00  Each of these has soup and then a variety of meat and seafood.  We had a table of 8 and I ordered the 57.00 menu.  It came with soup of the day, which is the best always.  Steamed Flounder, clams with black bean sauce, crispy chicken, crab with ginger / garlic, bok choy and mushroom, Peking Spare ribs.  As mentioned, the soup is the type that I have a hard time to find outside the SF Community and had to learn to make at home.  Double goiled, fish maw and crab. It is awesome.\n\nb.  Plus - I always order one or two add on to the fixed menu and have tried many, such as:\n\nc.  Beef Chow Fun (Dry) - I always order this for the kids and here it is as good as it gets. The noodles are the right consistency and firmness. The beef if extremely tasty and tender as it melts in your mouth.\n\nd.  Chicken with green onion and ginger - This is my favorite besides the salt baked chicken.  It is a simple dish, which brings out all the best flavors of the chicken and the chef's skill. This is essentially a boiled white chicken, whole or half and cut into bite size pieces that have all the bones in it.  Here it is great.\n\ne.  Steamed black Bass - I always love steamed fish and if the restaurant has a fresh water tank for the fish, I order it.  This time, they had bass and it was very nice. The mixture of steaming it with green onion, cilantro and then the soy sauce and oil is just right. Easy to remove the bone and to chow down on the tasty morsels!\n\n4.  Go back factor - This is my go to place when in town to see friends and family.\n\n5.  If you are from Hong Kong or southeast asia, you may find this place a bit under performing.  If you are a descendant from the Chinese immigration 100-150 years ago, you will know what it means to have this type of food at this restaurant.
