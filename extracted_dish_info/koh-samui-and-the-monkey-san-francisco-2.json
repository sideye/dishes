And then a bazillion have 4 stars.\n\nThis is the problem when it comes to Thai food: it is really hard to mess it up.  Thai food tends to be both budget and vegetarian friendly, and so generally everyone wins.  Who doesn't love Thai Iced Tea?\n\nThe dilemma then becomes how do you differentiate between Thai restaurants in SF?  Sure, there's the ever important how far is it from your house factor, and the do they have unlimited supplies of Siracha (rooster) sauce factor, or do they have anything other than Geyser Peak wine factor.  But really, when it comes down to it, they are testament to that especially San Francisco of problems: they are all so good.\n\nHowever, for me, none stands out above the crowd more than Koh Samui and the Monkey.  Here's why:\n\n1) Atmosphere: at Koh Samui, they've taken SOMA warehouse/office building and turned it into a lush, bubbling fountain, Giant Buddha kind of place, but without being tacky.  The decor doesn't overwhelm nor underwhelm: it just fits.  The end result is when you go to Koh Samui, you feel like you're doing something a little special, but without paying \"special\" prices.\n\n2) Presentation: The Fresh Spring Rolls (with shrimp, mint leaf and noodle) come out in a little dish that reminds you of a boat, with an umbrella that suggests a long lazy float down a river.  The pumpkin curry (chicken with red curry sauce served in pumpkin) is served in an actual green pumpkin.  Bags of Gold (minced chicken, shrimps wrapped in rice paper sacks) look, indeed, like bags of gold.  Even the dish I get most often, the \"Tofu with peanut sauce topped with crispy basil\" looks like someone thought about where they would ladle the sauce, not the standard mashup of ingredients you find elsewhere.\n\nWine List: A Pinot Noir from Central Otago. A Spanish Tempranillo. A lovely Chilean Reisling.  These are not your average Thai restaurant wines.\n\nFood: I think about the Tofu with peanut sauce when I am away.

The sauce was too sweet and too much of it.  \n\nSea bass Mor Din - steamed seabass sauteed w/ vermicelli noodle, shitake mushroom, broccoli and carrots - $16 - it was ok.\n\nEggplant tofu sauteed w/ bell pepper, fresh basil in chili and garlic sauce - $9 - it was ok, a bit on the greasy side\n\nYoung pepper pork - $13 - this was the best dish.  It has a nice spicy flavor to it - the pork was pretty tender.\n\nSteamed jasmine rice - $2.50.\n\nWe mixed the eggplant tofu to the pork and brought it home.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["A lunch special of Yellow Curry with potatoes and curry came with a side of Crispy Imperial Rolls. \n\n"], "author": "Mike K.", "review": "The past few weeks have been a blurry of lunch meetings and early morning coffees, but along the way, I've been able to explore some great new spots.\n\nLast week we sat down at Koh Samui and The Monkey, and if the aroma that drifts for blocks isn't enticing enough, the bustle of wide eyed eaters that pack into the venue will excite you.\n\nThe menu offers a wide selection, inspired heavily by the many spices that accompany Thai cuisine.

Larb is a salad of sorts, which is mainly composed of a meat (or tofu), onion, cilantro, lime, fish sauce, and chili. They do it very well here and it's served in a bell pepper. We also ordered the green papaya salad. Not much to say here, other than it was fresh and tasty.\n\nDuck---something, i can't exactly remember what, but it was served with a soy based sauce and spinach and it was amazing--succulent, succulent duck.

We actually had a discussion about this before ordering, one of the other people said that pad thai is the best way to tell if the thai restaurant is any good...a barometer of sorts to gauge the place. I personally disagree, i feel like pad thai is like ordering refried beans at a Mexican restaurant, it doesn't really tell you anything. The curries are where it's at! to me pad thai is a waste of a dish, but some people like to stick with what they know, what are you going to do?\n\nSouthern Curry. Beef panang curry. So amazingly good, it was a great blend of sweet and spicy and it was a thick curry sauce--it really stuck to the meat and rice and added a lot of flavor.

The Eggplant Tofu was good, but perhaps the weakest of the entrees we sampled.  The eggplant was well-cooked (still firm and well-flavored), but it was already only warm by the time it arrived to the table rather than piping hot.\n\nWhile the steamed brown rice was your average steamed rice, the coconut rice was OFF THE HOOK!

In addition, the AC was cranked on, so it was FREEZING like an ice box (we politely asked them to turn down the air, and they complied). Oh, and this was at around 6pm. However, after the sun finally set, the interior ambiance started to show up in dark wood, dim lighting, and asian decor. It turned out to be very trendy and romantic.\n\nMY MAIN GRIPE: We went here for a birthday occasion, so upon making the dinner reservation via OpenTable.com, I indicated in the notes section that this was a special birthday dinner. Having completely forgotten about that note, I was completely shocked when they brought over a nice little plate of chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and a happy birthday serenade. It was very sweet! The cake was actually delicious (and I normally don't like cake), and the coconut ice cream complimented it quite well. We didn't have to go to our next spot for dessert. HOWEVER, and here it is...I got the bill, and they charged us a whole $9 for the cake!! WTF?? Who does that? First of all, birthday dessert is normally complimentary at restaurants, and when it's not, they specify....not just randomly bring something out to your table and then BILL you for it!? Especially on a tab that was already $80?? NOT COOL. Management needs to get its act together. Two stars for that shadyness.\n\nI'm uncertain whether I'll be back at this point...", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-11-02"}, {"excerpts": ["We had Green Papaya Salad, Corn Fritters, Pumpkin Curry, and the Asian Beef.

The lamb was tender (a plus!), but was over seasoned (too salty!). It did, however, come with some nice veggies to cut the salt factor. The pad thai was slightly too al dente for my taste and the flavor wasn't too memorable. The Fire Cracker (mixed seafood, bell, onion, carrot, green bean and spicy peanut sauce) had a great sauce and the seafood was cooked well. This was my dish of choice among the three we tried. The Thai iced tea was too sweet (but that is the case for a lot of places); I simply diluted with water.\n\nOverall, the food was probably at 3 stars, and at a 3-star level I would return to try other dishes, but because of the price tag I have to give this place a 2.

Lastly the cup of tom yum kung soup came and 3 prawns were included in it. Very flavorful. \n\nBy this time we were pretty content. Although we still had 2 dishes coming. We had the shrimp pad thai and the Sri Ra Char Grilled Pork. The Pad Thai had was served with maybe 6 pieces of shrimp or more which was nice, although the noodles seemed a bit undercooked or stiff. Not as soft and lacked the kick I usually taste..maybe it could have used a little more fish sauce or rice vinegar? I'm not sure..but something... and the Grilled Pork was plentiful but it seemed more like it was panned fried vs. grilled? It came with sticky rice and some pickled cucumbers w/ mangos on the side which was a nice touch. \n\nWould we come back, maybe...although it was pricey although we did order a lot for just 2 1/2 people.

I would've never imagined to combine all these ingredients together, but they do complement each other very well. I would recommend this to try! \n\nTom Yum Kung Soup\nA little bit too sour for me, but it was okay. Bf really enjoyed this soup, as the prawns inside tasted really fresh! \n\nLarb Gai\nOther than spiciness from the chilies, the chicken was otherwise bland. I felt that it was a little bit too spicy for my taste.. and just underwhelming. Would definitely skip this dish.\n\nKee Mao Pork Sausage\nLimited selection of noodle dishes. This dish was okay, but was a little bit disappointed when it came out because it wasn't the flat rice noodles.. instead it was like squid ink spaghetti.. This dish, too, was a bit too spicy and lacked some flavor of a Kee Mao noodle dish.

I've eaten at a lot of different Thai restaurants and while the food was good, it wasn't anything special. Except for the Tofu Mieng Kum appetizer, which was awesome. This appetizer is a lettuce leaf containing a small piece of fried tofu, a tiny lime piece, onion, chopped peanut, chili and ginger. You simply put some of the accompanying roasted coconut dip on top of the other ingredients, wrap it up, and devour. I joked to my friends it was a \"flavor bomb.\" Each bite of this wonderful appetizer packs an incredibly flavorful burst to the taste buds.\n\nWe had a chicken dish that was good but pretty basic - just some chicken with red and green bell peppers, onion and basil. The portion was pretty small. The green vegetable curry tasted good but was very watery. We also had tofu and shrimp pad thai (tasty, with noodles that were more al dente which I prefer) and pea sprouts sauteed with garlic. I loved the pea sprouts, which were flavorful and garlicky. I don't see pea sprouts served at many restaurants so this was a real treat for me. \n\nAll in all a good meal in a restaurant with pretty decor, a full bar, and very nice ambiance and service.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-04-19"}], "lunch spicy tumeric salmon": [], "lunch chicken cashew nut": [], "lunch praram spinach chicken": [], "lunch sweet chili basil chicken": [], "lunch crispy chicken fried rice": [], "lunch prawn asparagus": [], "lunch thai pork stew": [], "lunch garlic and pepper beef": [], "lunch belly basil": [], "lunch beef mango": [], "lunch spicy tom yam fried rice": [], "lunch stir fried green beans": [], "lunch wok fried spicy basil": [], "lunch southern kurkling": [], "monday special": [], "tuesday special": [], "wednesday special": [], "thursday special": [], "friday special": [], "stirfried asparagus with oyster sauce": [], "woksauteed mushrooms": [], "stirfried green beans": [], "stirfried baby bok choy": [], "stirfried chinese broccoli": [], "stirfried cabbage": [], "stirfried iceberg lettuce": [], "royal curry": [{"excerpts": ["My Royal Curry with the red curry sauce option was horribly undercooked ", "and I was so hungry by the time the food arrived that I just ate it anyway.

As it is, this place very nearly ruined Valentine's Day for us.\n\nWe'd taken care to get our reservation in for Valentine's Day weeks before. They called to confirm, we had the confirmation email. What happens when we get there? We get told our reservation is not on the list at all, and they refused to seat us to boot - we had to dig out the email on my bf's phone for them to even give us a table.\n\nThe hostess then apologizes profusely and hastily gives us the tiny table along the aisle between the wall and the bar stools. Which turns out to be extremely drafty, and since I was dressed for the evening out I was shivering with cold and nearly got sick by the time the night was over.\n\nI'm not the sort to be turned off a good meal by cold, bad/rude service or crappy decor. But I've eaten better at holes-in-the-wall and this time the mixup with the reservations could not be saved by the food. My Royal Curry with the red curry sauce option was horribly undercooked and I was so hungry by the time the food arrived that I just ate it anyway. The vegetables (carrots, etc) were hard, tofu in it was bland. The only good thing about the curry was the sauce, which kind of tasted like it simply had been poured on. My bf's pumpkin curry was better and tasted like it had been properly stewed a while, but for $16 a portion, I'm expecting a great curry, and not merely a small portion of decent curry I could cook at home. Since we had gotten a Bloomspot deal I decided to have a pumpkin curry without the chicken. Which cued a repeat performance of blah-ness, though since squash is so easy to cook, it was soft enough for me.  The curry sauce did not fare so well and tasted hastily slapped on yet again.\n\nWe probably should have demanded they take back the Royal curry and complained about our reservation, but BF and I aren't the types to make a scene. If you are a curry enthusiast, and/or wanting to take no chances on impressing on special dinner date, this is a place best left unvisited.\n\nEdit: To the poster who called me an idiot - Oh sure, because other people have lives (including myself) to the extent they're busy on Valentine's Day and go to a restaurant post-work or college totally invalidates their previous review that the food sucked. I know what good curry tastes like and if you got offended that I slammed your favorite haunt, sorry, but it doesn't work that way. I say to you - I have standards when I eat, and I wouldn't have chosen this place, V-day or no, if I'd known the food and service was this bad. Had the restaurant cared about its customers they would have saved us a table in the main dining area, as well.

Sauce was too spicy for my liking, and I didn't touch the cucumber vinaigrette. Ordered steamed coconut rice which had a lovely flavour but should have been included with the entree. \n\nI'm a little on the fence with this one. The restaurant started to \"break down\" a little after us arriving. We were a party of 5, so I sat on the end of the table, which was unfortunately underneath a dripping pipe from the A/C. Nearby servers rotated the table, and in the end, moved our party to a different table altogether.  I was waiting for the women's washroom (single stall) when a male server came out and told me the soap dispenser was damaged. And I'm not sure he actually washed his hands properly in the process of trying to fix it, because he came out to say he couldn't. \n\nAs for ambiance, it's a bit busy with the decorations, but it gets quite loud, to a level where it was hard to hear one of our dinner companions two seats away from me unless I really leaned forward and strained to listen in. \n\nI'm not sure that I would recommend it, but I wouldn't object if someone suggested going there for lunch (when rice is apparently included with meals).
