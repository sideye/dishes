Our reservation was at 7:30, and we weren't seated until 8:00.  As we sat in wait by the host booth, we noticed that a tall, athlete-looking man and his date walked in without a reservation, requested a table by the water, and were seated immediately.  The hosts and manager/owner(?) fluttering about the host stand appeared disorganized and disheveled.  No one smiled.  \n\nWhen they finally seated us after our half hour wait, there was no apology for or acknowledgment of the wait whatsoever.  This tone of unapologetic neglect characterized our entire experience at Waterfront; for a place charging $20 and up for mediocre entrees, this kind of service is inexcusable.  \n\nAt the table, my mother was seated in a chair in which she found her feet entangled in the tubing that supplies fuel to the outdoor heating lamps, a set-up that seems a likely fire hazard.  When she asked the waiter to move her to the other side of the table, he hesitated because, he said, he \"might trip on it himself.\"  Hello?  Why was it set up this way in the first place?  \n\nThe waiter was horrible.  I have no idea why this man is in the food service profession.  He seemed nervous, and had absolutely no sense of graciousness.  He immediately asked us for our order without even greeting us, he didn't tell us the specials until we asked, he offered no explanation for our hour-long wait for our entrees, and (as I read in another review-- must be the same waiter), his response to anything we said was \"understood.\"  My mother's food came without the herb salad described on the menu.  When we pointed this out after we finished our meals (he never came back to check in with us as we ate, and we were not able to flag him down), he responded that our discontent was  \"understood.\"  Neither did he offer to comp a dessert or drink nor to bring the salad!  \n\nAfter an hour wait for the entress, we were so hungry that just about anything would taste good, yet I couldn't even finish my meal.  The lobster risotto was the only dish worth ordering of the three we had at our table.  The mesquite grilled sea bass was AWFUL-- dry and ill-prepared.  I can do better myself at home.  The sea bass came with no side dishes, no garnish-- essentially no color whatsover on the white plate.  The aeshetic presentation was much like one imagines food in the Arctic Tundra in the dead of winter -- white, gray, cream colors.  Bland all around.  I ate about a fourth of the fish before I gave up.  The spinach and fig salad I ordered for an appetizer was equally disappointing-- the spinach leaves were large and tough, and the dressing was gummy and sweet, kind of like Chinese dipping sauce.  I didn't finish that either (it's rare that I leave food on my plate, even if it's mediocre).   \n\nThe one glimmer of pleasure in this meal was the dessert course.  We shared a peach tartin and almond cake, both of which were lovely.  Their pastry chef seems to be the only one in the kitchen who knows what he/she is doing.  \n\nI definitely won't return to this place.

For the past couple years, I've been lucky enough to observe this week-long celebration of the coming of spring (characterized by inebriation, heavy partying, and usually a lot of nudity) in South Beach. Spring break in Cancun? That's for children compared to Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference week in Miami. And this year was no different. I flew back from four straight days of debauchery on Sunday night, and I was DEAD tired. All I wanted to do for my birthday the next day was sleep. However, having the sweetest sister in the world (poor me), she wanted to invite a couple of my friends and set up a little birthday dinner. How could I possibly say no to that? \n\nSis suggested that we go to the Waterfront. I knew where it was, but I hadn't been there in years. Since I wasn't doing any of the planning, I basically let my little sister do all the legwork. We got there about 15 minutes late, but thanks to the adorable valet who calls all the ladies \"bella\", we were able to get inside right away. My sister had called ahead and requested a table with a view, and they had told her they would try to accommodate us as much as possible, but it so happened that there was a huge Siemens conference going on that night and they had taken up the entire downstairs patio that overlooked the bay. Waterfront, however, was gracious enough to save a table for us upstairs that had an equally amazing view. We were seated right away.\n\nOur waiter came by and gave us the usual spiel on recommendations for the night. He then took our order, sans notepad. I love when they do that. Not only was the staff extra knowledgeable about the food, they were helpful and attentive, even though we were sitting in a table tucked away into one of the more secluded corners of the restaurant. Our glasses were never empty, our dishes came out promptly, and our food was at perfect temperature. I had the handmade seafood linguini, but I did try a little bite from everyone else, and they all tasted amazing. When the lobster mac and cheese came out, I could smell the truffle oil wafting into my brain and tantalizing all my senses. I. Love. Truffle.

We were looking simply looking for an apology and at least an offer to rectify the mishap (Really sorry about that, here's some dessert?).\n\nOur waiter sent the manager over to our table towards the end of the meal and his immediate response was to say \"You shouldn't have your phone on the table, I keep mine in my pocket.\" This is how he APPROACHED the conversation - didn't even greet us or tell us his name. It was more than 5 minutes into the discussion before he apologized, and that was after I pointed out that we had not yet received an apology. \n\nWe're reasonable people and understand that accidents happen. We had a circular conversation for over 10 minutes (I'm sure this disturbed other diners, but what did he care?) with someone who has blatant disregard for customer service and not an iota of people skills (rude, condescending and hostile is the extent of his abilities). He offered no solutions and was reluctant to even provide us with a business card (which he never did).\n\nFor what it's worth, this is the first Yelp! review I've been compelled to write. We've all experienced bad service and accidents happen. We weren't looking to get a free meal, but this guy was completely horrible.

The restaurant is very nice and it's got great service.  It's a little expensive and a little too touristy, but still a good place to eat.\n\nThe food was good.  I got the appetizer of black truffle and lobster macaroni and cheese.  It was delicious and not a big amount.  It did have a lot of lobster and great flavor.

I had always wanted to try Waterfront after driving by a few times and then checking out their menu online though.  Plus, it's right on the waterfront (so THAT's where the name comes from... =P), so that view alone made it worthwhile to try.\n\nWe came here on a mild evening for their Happy Hour menu, and got a chance to eat in their \"patio\" area.  Wanting to try a bit of everything, we ordered their Clams with White Wine and Garlic, Mussels in Madras Curry, Calamari, Fries, and the Duet of Sliders.  The Calamari and the Fries were pretty standard, though they went great with the aioli sauce (calamari) or the mussels/clams sauces (fries).  The Clams and Mussels were pretty good, but I would opt for the mussels again if only because the Madras Curry made it a little more unique.  The real winner was the sliders plate - really hit the spot with a cold beer after a day at work, and probably one of the better sliders I've had.  \n\nThere are certainly some redeeming qualities about this place, but I have to admit I can see why some felt their experience was underwhelming.  Service was uneven, as the waitress was nice, but it took a while for her to make her rounds.  Also, when we arrived to get a table for the happy hour, the hostess gave us an odd look and checked the clock before bringing us a table (we were there 30 mins before it ended, so not sure what was going on there).

"], "author": "Annie T.", "review": "I'm going to break this review into three categories: Food, Ambiance, Service.\n\nFood: 2 stars\nCrab cakes: Actually quite good. They were very small, but the crab was very meaty, fresh, and it wasn't mucked up with any creaminess in the cake itself. The sauce served with the crab cakes complimented the crust nicely.\nFries: Average and for the money I expected better. They could have been a little crispier, maybe cooked another minute\nClam Chowder: It had bacon in it, which was very nice. The bacon was quality (thick chunks of smoked bacon). There was also a nice amount of pepper in the chowder, which I really enjoyed. I think what was missing was that it seemed that the bacon was thrown into the chowder as an afterthought - it didn't taste as if the soup itself were stewed with bacon so the flavor wasn't injected well throughout the soup. Also, it was a little too creamy and thick for my taste. I prefer a chowder that you can't stand a spoon up in.\nLemon Risotto with Lobster: There may as well have been no lobster in there, because I didn't get any lobster flavor at all. I expected the lemon to be more flavorful - there was only a hint of lemon and there was zero lemon on the finish. My expectation was to have some seafood (lobster, perhaps?) undertone but there was nothing. The portion was enormous, however and it took passing the plate around to finish it.\nSpecial last night - seared ahi tuna with butternut squash puree - It was maybe the biggest serving of ahi tuna I have ever seen. It was too thick - the sear was so thin compared to the sheer thickness of the steak. There were two pieces served in a bowl - the bowl was far too small for this portion. that dish could have easily been served on a platter twice as big. Presentation was horrible. Ok, back to the food. I took a bite and I was surprised at the lack of flavor. It was basically sashimi with a 30 second sear on each side with no flavoring. The butternut squash puree was too thin - and there was far too much of it served - you couldn't pick it up really with your fork, you really needed a spoon to scoop it.  The sweetness was nice, but I didn't understand what it was doing with the ahi tuna - there was nothing added to the ahi by combining the puree with the tuna in one bite. \nPetrole Sole - There was nothing really impressive about this dish. The fish itself was well cooked but there was a severe lack of flavoring. The sauce served with the sole was tomato-based and added absolutely nothing to the fish.\nCrab mashed potatoes - this was by far the tastiest thing I had all night. I would go here just to get the crab mashed potatoes... it was SO GOOD. You took a bite and there was the perfect amount of shredded crabmeat intermingled with thick mashed potato and a lovely sweet butteriness that was just fabulous.\nAlmond Cake dessert - I enjoyed the almond cake, but I've had better (often). The cake itself was moist enough but the dish would have benefited from having some liquor-based sauce drizzled over it. Strawberries and creme fraise were served with the dish. . . the creme needed a little more sweetness, it was quite bland. The combination of the three was very light - overall for a dessert too mild.\nPeach Tartin with Cinnamon Ice Cream - Average. The tart itself didn't stand up to the heavily syruped (and very thinly sliced) peaches. Cinnamon Ice cream was very nice - not too sweet and could have actually been a little less sweet to contrast the very very syrupy peaches.\nWhite Peach and Lemon Sorbet - my favorite dessert. Definitely order this. The white peach sorbet had that lovely \"fuzzy\" finish, which seems so hard to replicate because I rarely have the pleasure of experiencing fuzzy sorbet. The lemon sorbet was fabulous. Very tart, made your lips smack, and complimented the white peach very well. I would definitely go out of my way just to have some.\nCreme Brulet - I'd say that this creme brulet was above average. I love when it's not too firm, which this pulled off. Didn't knock my socks off.\nEspresso - this was really very good and my date actually ordered one for himself after tasting mine. did not taste burnt at all, very nice creme, lovely finish. Complimented the almond cake very nicely.\n\nAll in all, I will probably never go back for food. But, it very well may be a nice place to stop in for dessert and espresso.\n\nAmbiance: 5 stars on the patio, 2 stars indoors\nThe patio is the winner here, everyone's said it. The space is small and intimate and the view is to die for. There's really no other reason to take someone here.\n\nService: 2 stars, was three, but they lost a point at the very end. \nService was OK.  He took quite a while to get around to ordering. He never once came by to ask how the food or how the drinks were, which was a bit odd - at the end however, he said \"you do realize service is not included, right?\" Umm...

The restaurant is pretty, the view is great. If you get stuck going here, its not the end of the world. Whoever designed the menu did a reasonably good job, but the execution is poor both on the food quality and the service front. And you know what poor execution means in a seafood restaurant: yup, that's overcooked fish. Nothing here tastes _bad_, mind you, but its often not high on the flavor or freshness scale. As other reviewers observed, the crab mashed potatoes are worth eating, esp. with a tasty lemon sauce around them. Your other choices are tuna (got good reviews at my table), slightly overcooked salmon, slightly overcooked white fish of various varieties. And steak. Dessert, ditto: flourless chocolate cake, ok, apple tart , shrug, etc etc. If I were served this food at a large wedding or other event, it would be unremarkably fine. Something you can eat without comment in the background. At an SF restaurant, it seems inexcusable. Especially given the prices.\n\nAs for the service, it was well-intentioned. But it didn't work out successfully. We were a table of 10, and the waitress wrote down the position of every dish. But then the plates would come and it would be a whole 5 min of, who ordered the salmon? Repeated with every course. And the wrong desserts came out, there was a 5 min discussion withe the waitress of whether it was possible to order a half-caf cappuccino (I was spectating and the result seemed highly unclear, though some form of cappuccino did arrive). And each plate seemed to be brought by a different person who had no contextual information, despite the fact that the restaurant was largely empty.\n\nTo sum up: the 2.5 star average on Yelp seems fair to me. Don't go by choice, but if you have to go, you'll live through the experience.

We did have reservations for four, but the place was not crowded at all. We were seated right away. The view is incredible! Too bad it was overcast. The staff is very courteous, friendly and attentive. Two brunch specials ($20. ea) were ordered that had granola & fruit with cream to start, then a single halved sausage served with a egg & mushroom scramble. Sorbet & coffee... nothing really exciting. I ordered the fried calamari appetizer($11), which was really tender and seasoned really great, and the fish and chips entree. This order was pathetic... a bed of battered fries and onions, with five or six fish nuggets on top and a little cup of malt vinegar. $16 bucks!

I had been hoping that the other reviews were just a fluke, but sadly, this is not true.  \n\nMy first reaction: \"tacky tacky tacky\" when I saw the reference to a 4% surcharge on your bill being added for health insurance costs.  Why not just add it to the cost of the menu without making me feel guilty?  I want San Franciscans to have health insurance.  I want good food.  I do not care for passive agressive political statements on my menu.\n\nThat being said, it's really about the food. I ordered off the \"fresh fish wild your way\"  part of the menu, and selected sea bass.  I mean, really.  Sea bass is a glorious fish and kind of hard to mess up, considering the fat content.  And my fish wasn't bad.  It just wasn't good.  The fish was slightly overdone and somewhat tasteless.  I will say, however, that the soy citrus wasabi sauce was very tasty.  Perhaps the flavors could have been used better than as a sauce added on the plate.  \n\nThe crab mashed potatoes were promising comfort food.  Again, they were good, but not great.  Just a bit underseasoned.  \n\nOn a good note, the pancetta wrapped prawns were grilled to perfection and the wine choices were as expected.  The location can't be beat - great views all around.  \n\nOverall, I'm not going back.  May be worth trying once, if someone else is paying and you want a nice view to go with your dinner.
