I used to look forward to my Pronto Pizza, but the past few times I've ordered, something major has been wrong... \n\nWhen I was first introduced to Pronto by my neighbors, it was when they had a guy standing in front of their door holding a fantastic smelling pizza that was obviously nice and fresh, as I could see the steam escaping from the box. Neat. Then I actually got to enjoy several similar deliveries of my own tasty pizza and/or wings. \"Hooray\" I thought. But it wasn't to last long...\n\nEpisode1: I now recognize what was the begging of the end...Rather than the more typical 45mins, my delivery was well over an hour. By the time my pizza finally arrived, it wasn't nice and fresh, but all congealed and the crust was soggy in the middle.\n\nSigh. I thought it was just because it was a busy weekend...\n\nEpisode 2: Delivery took over an hour. I answer the door, buzz the guy in and he just sits there waiting for me. It shouldn't matter that I live on the 3rd floor. I'm lounging around in my sweats, relaxing and watching movies...If I wanted to find my jacket, put on shoes and go down to the street, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO MY OWN DAMN CAR AND PICKED IT UP MYSELF. Delivery means *to my door*. Not to my building, to my street or the bottom of the stairs at the end of my building. To top it off? He was surly with me for having to wait. Are you kidding me? I did pizza delivery for 4 years full time. It's not hard work you lazy fuck.\n\nBut I was probably just unlucky. Off night with a driver who clearly wouldn't last long. Besides, everyone has an off night right? Wrong!\n\nEpisode3: I'm planning on working through the weekend and want lots of leftovers...and some dessert! So I ring up Pronto for an order of wings, pizza and a couple slices of cake. Again, over an hour to deliver, same bum of a driver won't come to my door, and it appears they've charged me $12 for two pieces of cake?!? So now I have to stand around in the cold while this guy tries to call back to his office to work it out....\n\nIt eventually gets done, but too little too late. If I want delivery, I want an effing delivery. If I have to walk down to my car anyhow, what's the point? There are much better places I can do take out from.\n\nSorry Pronto.
