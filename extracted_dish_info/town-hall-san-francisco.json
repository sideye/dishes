Overall for $15 I would expect to get more than 3 tiny servings (approx 6 bites).\n\n* Tuna tartare - as expected, really can one go wrong with tuna tartare? I'm not a big fan of fried green tomatoes in general and Town Hall is no exception. Really hard green tomatoes with no flavor\n\n* Cornmeal fried oysters - best appetizer of the evening by unanimous vote and also the best fried oysters I've had. Super juicy and clean flavor.\n\n* BBQ shrimp - just plain weird. A few shrimp on top of a huge piece of toast soaked in sauce. Took people a while to figure out what this brown thing was under the shrimp. Looked very unappetizing so I didn't try it but it did disappear.\n\n* Buttermilk biscuits - pretty awesome if you make a sandwich by spreading the jelly on the biscuit halves and wedging the prosciutto in between. Only 3 tiny biscuits though for $14. Could really use more biscuits given the amount of prosciutto.\n\nMain courses are more solid. I had the soft shell crab with a side of crispy okra. The crab was really good. The crispy okra came out whole and the breading was a little too oily. Other people ordered the pork chop, duck breast and fried chicken and everyone liked what they ordered.\n\nDesserts were the opposite of the appetizers. Too much of a good thing. I got the butterscotch and chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me which was more like a bowl de cr\u00e9me. Gigantic cereal bowl of pudding. No one was able to eat more than half on their own. Couldn't even take it home. I mean, I'm sure I could but how do you box up a layered pudding in a doggy bag?\n\nOverall food is 4 stars, service 2 stars, value 3 stars if you avoid the appetizers.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-08-14"}, {"excerpts": ["- buttermilk biscuits with prosciutto and Red pepper jelly - a lovely savory/sweet combo\n- Ham, cheese and egg toast with jalape\u00f1o cream - decadent goodness!!\n\n"], "author": "Melissa S.", "review": "I had been to Town Hall a few times about 4 years ago when working downtown and always thought highly of the restaurant. So when a childhood friend of mine came to town to visit, I thought this would be a good choice for a nice dinner. I was a little nervous about bringing our 2 year old son with us, but we couldn't get a babysitter.\n\nAfter I made a reservation, I decided to look at some reviews here on Yelp and was disappointed to find that some recent reviews were less than stellar and one reviewer was treated harshly after bringing a 2 year old nephew to dinner. Feeling uncomfortable after reading these reviews, I tried to find another venue for dinner but couldn't get a table on such short notice for Saturday night.\n\nThankfully, our dinner experience turned out to be quite wonderful. As soon as the hostess checked us in, she asked if we would like some crayons and paper for our son which we gratefully accepted. We had to wait perhaps 10 mins for our server to appear, but after that our order was taken promptly and we didn't have to wait long between courses. \n\nThe food itself got a huge thumbs up, every dish we ordered was flavorful and generously portioned:\n\n- heirloom tomato salad - very fresh, loved the mint and yoghurt dressing\n- tomato mascarpone risotto - creamy yet refreshing. The fresh tomatoes made all the difference.\n- buttermilk biscuits with prosciutto and Red pepper jelly - a lovely savory/sweet combo\n- Ham, cheese and egg toast with jalape\u00f1o cream - decadent goodness!!\n\nWe shared ou mains family style and got to sample the best of what Town Hall has to offer:\n- BBQ Ribs - meat fell off the bone, the sauce was a standout\n- Pork cooked two ways - perfectly tender pork medallions and pork belly, paired perfectly with nectarines\n- fried chicken - juicy, nicely seasoned classic\n\nDessert was also great, but my favorite will always be the butterscotch and chocolate pudding, which was exactly as I remembered it years ago.\n\nOverall we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening and I was grateful that the restaurant accommodated our 2 year old as this is really a place for adults to enjoy and linger over dinner. (Another bonus was that the adjoining garden courtyard at 199 Fremont ended up being the perfect playground for my 2 year old when he couldn't sit still after we finished our mains.)\n\nI'm glad to say that I would still highly recommend Town Hall as a dining destination!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-09-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Buttermilk Biscuits: ", "A few tiny biscuits with prosciutto-style ham and peach jam topping options.

The coleslaw adds a nice tangy contrast to the fried chicken since it is vinegar based without cream.  The chicken breasts are like adult-sized chicken tenders.  Very tasty and moist, but I wish the chicken was fresh out of the fryer instead of at room temperature.\n\nButterscotch Chocolate Pot De Cr\u00e8me (Take Away): Butterscotch, amazing how butter and brown sugar can create such magic.

The chicken was fresh and cooked to flawlessness - juicy inside and crispy outside with a lot of flavor.  The mashed potatoes were incredible since I can tell it was loaded with butter and cream (this is why I never make mashed potatoes at home).  The vegetables tasted like they had just been plucked from a near-by farm earlier that day especially for me...I really enjoyed the fact that the zucchini was not over-cooked and still had a bit of \"crunch\" to it.

I almost always get chocolate for dessert, but I'm glad I changed my mind at the last minute.  First of all, it's a huge portion, second of all it was swimming in caramel and that was enough for me.  As with everything else I'd eaten there so far, it tasted fresh...someone had made bread pudding literally when I ordered it and I could taste the milk and eggs and cinnamon and other yummy goodness that went into the dessert.  The pudding was soft and decadent, yet hearty and wonderful.  Toffee encrusted the top of the pudding and oozed into the upper nooks and crannies - it was syrupy-sweet and buttery goodness. Did I mention it was swimming in caramel?  I've had homemade caramel before, but this stuff was something else: sweet, rich, slight salty and completely amazing.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone...I'm not sure if they can completely accommodate those who are finicky eaters, but if you enjoy American Comfort food, this place takes the ordinary to extraordinary heights.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-04-21"}, {"excerpts": ["Buttermilk biscuits were melt in your mouth.

But I guess if you're ranking it against the rest of Bauer's Top 100, maybe they're not flawless. But we went last night and it was the most satisfying restaurant experience I've ever had. \n\nAbout me: ex-chef, would much rather have a delicious, filling meal than a 2-ounce crazy chemistry experiement for $40. I'm pretty forgiving of waitstaff, take cocktails pretty seriously, but above all else I don't let small stuff get in the way of having a good time. I'm Anthony Bourdain but I don't like to travel.\n\nSo me and my lady were on our two-year anniversary. We got there about 45 minutes before our reservation hoping they had a bar, and they did. I had a Kentucky Gun and 710 Ashbury (both whiskey-based) and she had a Black Beauty and a Pim's something or other. All 4 were house cocktails, and well made, with an interesting balance of flavors, maybe not enough booze but then, I love a way-too-strong drink. On the list, the Kentucky Gun initially turned me off with the Tabasco, but there was a nice fruit-to-spicy transition in the drink. She liked both of hers, I think the best of the four was the Pim's whatever it was called. \n\nWe were sat on time at a small 2-person table (I'd left a note via OpenTable that we'd prefer not to get a communal table, since it was an anniversary, and it looks like they took care of us). Our server was friendly, informed, happy to give us more time even though we were seated around 9:30, and kept a smile all night. He had about the perfect balance of attention without being up our butts. I think his name was Javier -- Town Hall, if you're reading this, he was the best server I've ever had.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Cab, not one of their higher priced ones (I think it was $55) and I think it was probably obvious we weren't wine experts -- we might as well have thrown a dart at the list -- but it was a pretty good bottle. Server even beat me once to refilling her glass (it's a sin around here for me not to fill her glass).\n\nLike I said, I prefer to be satisfied than to be surprised, so I went with the Buttermilk Biscuits and ham starter. She had the Tuna Tartare. The biscuits were, without exaggeration, one of the favorite things I've ever eaten. The baked-to-order biscuits were deep-South-perfect, the Johnston ham was sliced incredibly thin and there was plenty of it, and the spicy, peppery jelly was an amazing complement. Slather some butter on a bite of biscuit, put some ham on there, and top it with the jelly, and I'm not kidding I may have never had more fun putting food in my mouth. She's a seafood freak, and was very impressed with the tuna. It was a bit spicier than she'd like, but she's incredibly sensitive to spicy, so that's not Town Hall's fault. It came with fired green tomatoes ( I think in a cornmeal crust or something) and they were spectacular. Both appetizers were rad.\n\nEntrees came out just in time. I was kinda surprised at the relatively basic plating of the entrees, but I have no problem with that. I feel like if you make the visuals too important you're not paying attention to the food enough. So \"basic\" is often, to me, a good sign. And I was right. Shit was on point. She got the Sole, I tried it and it was really damn good, especially the Concord grape reduction, but my New York steak was king of the night. I thought the meat itself had a bit of extra fat or silverskin in there, but that's what you get when you get it bloody. It was crispy on the outside, nice and red inside, and whatever the hell that sauce was, it was great. We were drinking, and I missed that detail. Mine even came with mushrooms, and I hate freaking mushrooms...but this time I cleaned my plate. Finally, this order was accompanied with a little iron pot of potatoes au gratin, and they were the kind you wish you'd grown up on. Share some fork space with the steak and the potatoes and that's what food should be, every meal. \n\nWe ordered the Butterscotch Pot de Creme, I got up to pee, and as I sat back down she says some other server guy had approached our table with a small plate, but turned away...she didn't know what was up...then here comes server #2 with a plate of three tiny cupcakes, \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate. It was an awesome thing to do (I guess they did see the OpenTable note!) and each cupcake was better than the last. We ate them in the order we thought we'd like them most: first a chocolate thing, then some cocnut German corporately thing, then something with nuts on top, and tuned out we liked them in reverse order of what we thought. Just as we finished, here came the Butterscotch pot, and it was incredible. Hard to describe, some kind of mix of butterscotch and chocolate creamy puddings with some crispy buttersctoch/toffee things floating on top. It was as ridiculous. We were both stuffed, but still I scraped the bowl clean. \n\nI'm out of characters, so, in short: perfect night.

Too bad it wasn't what I ordered. \n\nThe pork chop started out on the right foot (or hoof, I suppose?). The peanut crust added a nice texture, and the side of rice and fava beans complimented it. About halfway in to it, in the dim light of the restaurant, I could see that my pork chop wasn't quite dead - in fact, it was really pink near the bone. I quietly brought this to the attention of the waiter who said he would chastise the kitchen and comped our dessert, but didn't comp the half-eaten entree. I was a few drinks in and on an expense account so I didn't bother to argue. Mistakes happen to be sure, but really, if you're going to send out a plate of trichinosis, at least comp the entree.\n\nThe service was generally good but a bit inconsistent.

There is plenty of street parking outside the restaurant, which is a rarity in san francisco!\n\nAs us 4 girls entered for our 8:45 reservation (yes, I couldn't get one earlier), I realized that perhaps the red dress and oversized black clutch I had with me were perhaps too dressy for fried chicken, but the sophistication of the restaurant was just at the right level to give a gal an excuse to get dressed up!\n\n We arrived a bit early hoping they could seat us earlier and were accomodated so by the friendly front staff who sat us about 20 min's earlier.  \n\nAppetizers we ordered included cornmeal fried oysters with spinach puree and bacon, buttermilk biscutis with country ham and peaches, and yellowtail sashimi with melon. For an entree I ordered trout stuffed with crab and also tried the buttermilk fried chicken with gravy and mash potatoes and the scallop dish my friends had ordered. Everything was delicious and we found ourselves finishing every bite on the plates. \n\nMy top picks of must orders:\n\nAPPETIZERS: The buttermilk biscuits with the country ham and peach compote. The biscuits were too die for and the prosciutto style ham is an interesting pairing, but worked well.\n\nENTREE:  Buttermilk Fried chicken with mash potatoes and gravy. It was crispy without being oily and was perfectly cooked.\n\nOverall, the staff was friendly and helpful. We were dining with a friend who was gluten intolerant and they were able to make some suggestions and check with the chef on ingredients. \n\nSome negatives:\n\nThe service was a bit slow on the night we went. It took about 40 min's for our main dishes to arrive after the appetizers. \n\nThe bar area is great, but it's small and if you arrive late you won't find a seat. The restaurant itself gets very crowded and crammed. We learned this the hard way.\n\nThe acoustics are incredibly loud. It's great for groups, but a bit loud for intimate conversations.\n\nOverall, great place, great food and great atmosphere. It's worth the reservation.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I can't evaluate the food in the restaurant, just at the bar, but the country ham on buttermilk biscuits with pepper jelly literally melts in your mouth...", "There is also usually a superb selection of soups and salads, and the jalapeno cornbread is the perfect complement to any of these!"], "author": "Bear S.", "review": "The food at Town Hall is American Comfort food with a twist, and the atmosphere fits.

The statements and opinions expressed herein are those of the authors only, and not their beloved spouses, who may or may not agree.\n\nBen sez:\n\nWe picked Town Hall because the Chronicle had it on its list of the Top 100 Restaurants, and TH had availability on the day we wanted to go out and eat.  Because dinner was recently, it was hella raining when we visited (and yes, I'm over 30, and yes, I said hella, and yes, you can kiss my black ass, and yes, I'm not black).  The interior was bright and shining and welcoming and WARM (I'm stunned how many restaurants in the city are cold when the weather is cold---if you can't keep a restaurant warm, you're doing something wrong).  We were early, indeed, we showed up before the dining room officially opened, yet we were greeted and shown to our seats.  No coat check, which is one of several things keeping this from being a 5-star review.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: 5-star restaurants take your coat and bag.  I won't 5-star a place that doesn't.  Sorry, but you're on notice (Colbert-style).\n\nOur waitress was really nice, friendly, helpful, and prompt.  Very knowledgeable about the food (I got a 30 second lesson on the awesomeness of my quail), and the wine.  Really, one of the nicer waiters/waitresses I've encountered in SF.\n\nWe shared an appetizer of buttermilk biscuits and ham.  The biscuits were a little too doughy for me, but the ham was wonderful.\n\nI had the quail, as previously alluded.  The quail was stuffed, which is a bit surprising in and of itself (quail is usually considered by restaurants to be too small to stuff).  The stuffing was good (tiny minced carrots abounded).  The quail was entirely decent, not transcendent.\n\nFor dessert, I had the apple pie.  SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: THE APPLE PIE DESSERT WILL FEED 4 PEOPLE.  This is the one ball our waitress dropped.  This dessert is freaking huge.  It was wonderful, but huge.  I asked for extra ice cream, which was necessary: extra only meant 2 scoops, which was barely enough for me to eat half the pie.\n\nSo, my bottom line: very good, great service, solidly 4 stars.\n\nWifey sez:\n\nWow.  I actually get to type my own answer instead of having it transcribed for me.\n\nAnyway.....Yes the ham was tasty, but the appetizer was barely big enough to share.  Personally I thought the biscuits were tasty too -- I like doughy biscuits.\n\nMy entree was a pork chop the size of a grapefruit.  And almost as round.  It was crusted with a peanut sauce of some sort -- good, but almost too many flavors were present.  It had a spicy, make-your-gums-tingle sorta kick to it that caught up with you after the first couple of bites.  Accompanying it was some patty pan squash and apples.  With the spicy chop, I would have liked more apple than squash, but overall I was pleased.\n\nDessert....Key Lime pie.  Mmmmmm....Key Lime pie.  It was tangy and tart (and delightful).  Like the apple pie, it was quite large -- easily a two-person dessert.  Somehow, through the pain and guilt, I was able to eat most of it.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-02-05"}, {"excerpts": ["i got to sample the fries, the buttermilk biscuits, and the baby beet salad was a very nice citrus medley.\n\n"], "author": "Anh V.", "review": "the simple design of this place makes it welcoming to come in for lunch or happy hour.  \n\ni had the day off so taking a two hour lunch was absolute decadence.  \n\nwith the tech convention so close by, i was pressed to get a cab so i ended up driving.  without any quarters in my pocket (hold the jokes pls), i was forced to pony up 17 bucks for lot parking a block away on howard and 1st.\n\ngeez, i am such a food whore...i mean enthusiast.  \ni got to sample the fries, the buttermilk biscuits, and the baby beet salad was a very nice citrus medley.\n\nthe meatloaf was a solid homestyle classic but i have to say that the rabbit, shrimp and crawfish etouffee was excellent.  \ni never eat leftovers since i go out almost every single day but i did take the leftovers home and am writing this with it in my distended but happy belly. \n\nwell, my mother always said that no meal is complete without dessert.  and yes, i was a fat kid growing up but i digress.\n\nthe end to the lovely meal was the cheesecake with sugared kumquats.  \n\nthe bill was discreetly tucked away in an old hardcover book which i found amusingly creative.\n\nhmmmm, now, i wish i took the dessert leftovers home.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-02-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered; crispy squash blossoms with four cheese stuffing, pesto, and a roasted cherry tomato vinaigrette, tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes, garlic chips, and Tabasco green onion vinaigrette, Buttermilk biscuits with Johnston family country ham and Dry Creek peach marmalade, and finally, smoked anduoille sausage with green garlic onion marmalade and Zataran's mustard, and the jalapeno corn bread.

Finally the maitre d' came over and explained that our ticket had been lost.  We again explained that we were in a rush and he said he would get our food out ASAP.  He brought us two delicious cups of asparagus soup to tide us over.  Finally our food arrived.  It was pretty good, although my husband said his salmon tasted not so fresh.  My portabella mushroom sandwich was quite tasty and the housemade chips were excellent.  We asked for the bill when the food arrived to speed things up.  The bill came and it was for $6.  I asked if there were a mistake and the server said, \"No we lost your order so you don't have to pay for the food!\"  I was quite amazed as we have never been comped all of a meal just because the service was slow.

He comes back and sits down, pleased with his correct identification of the bread. The bread guy he assaulted swings over with another basket, and slaps a hand on my dad's shoulder, chuckling. This bread guy is my father's new best friend. \n\nSo, we get down to the Real Food. Butter lettuce salad, tuna tartare, fondue to start. Salad had slices of one of the crispest Fuji apples I've had in a while (I am a stickler for firm apples and have had horrible luck finding one the past few months). Tuna tartare was fresh and light, complete with fried green tomatoes, which I wanted to bury myself in, they were so delicious. Fondue was forgettable. \n\nAnd then, like a ton of bricks, they hit us. Both at the same time, both to share and fight over, both in the hands of a waitress who could not walk fast enough. \n\nFried chicken with corn, biscuits and gravy.\nSteak with white bean puree and a delectable, artery-clogging sauce. \n\nThe perfectly-breaded chicken was deceptively inviting; a knife through the center released a sinus-clearing cloud of steam, taunting my hungry stomach. The roof of my mouth was pissed, as I defied the thought to let it cool off, and inhaled the chicken. Unlike many, I've never been head-over-heels for fried chicken, but I can (did) definitely appreciate the combination of crispy outside, juicy inside. \n\nWell beyond full at this point, I ventured towards the steak. I rarely (HA. GET IT?) order a slab of meat for myself and so I didn't anticipate wanting much more than a few bites. One fork-to-mouth exchange and I was questioning why I would have ever made that assumption. Perfectly medium-rare, nice burst of mushroom and wine. I snuck the last bites before my father could slurp up the sauce. \n\nManufacturers make elastic waistbands for these occasions. We sat there in a communal food coma, waiting for someone to clear the empty plates that could have gone without a wash, they were so thoroughly cleaned. This is a good place to mention that service was sweet, but slow.  Part of why I had decided it suitable to eat anything presented to me (and more) was due to the fact that it took a LONG time to get it all out. Our waiter would zip by and apologize, but even my patient mother was getting a bit peeved. The only time this worked in our favor was after we had eaten the entire zoo, carousel, and gift shop. \n\nWith the passing time, we were able to digest and plan ourselves to further discomfort. My mother insisted we had to get the butterscotch pot de creme, based on her recent visit. \n\nI love my mother. \n\nThe majority of the food I mentioned above could be found elsewhere for a lesser price. However, the butterscotch pudding was worth every ache and pain my stomach growled out later that night. I considered getting my bag, silently unzipping it, tossing the bowl of rich butterscotch and chocolate into my bag, and RUNNING to the nearest alley so that I could be alone to lick every last drop. \n\nNot really my \"scene,\" I probably wouldn't go back just for a dinner. I would prefer to drop the dough in one of the many eclectic, smaller, just-as-delicious venues the city has to offer. \n\nThat said, if someone says \"pudding,\" you can rest assured my answer would be: \"TOWN HALL!\"", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-12-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the tuna tar-tare, veal meatballs, and the butter lettuce salad.

There are a bunch of guys and a few women in business suits sitting in the lounge/host area having a drink after work.

We did fine...we decided last minute not to wear our tracksuits.\n\nWe made our way through the small crowd  and realized that we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. The hardwood floor, brick, and dark and light contrasts on the wall gave it and the semi rustic feel. I felt like I was in a New England restaurant that has been around for years. All it needed was a weimaraner lying on an animal skin rug. The dog and rug of course are in front of the fireplace with a gun hunting rifle on it.  \n\nNo fox hunts or LL Bean here. We had Apollo: the super waiter. He was really warm and once the section filled up, handled it like a pro. He was attentive, funny and multi-tasked well (I was a waiter and appreciate the hustle). The menu is definitely New American but with a new-found twist on the classics. I love rich food. It makes me think of a grandmother cooking food to taste good; not an uptight LA cook appeasing moviestars with egg whites. By recommendation, we had a few starters and shared an main. It was more than enough. We had the tuna tar-tare, veal meatballs, and the butter lettuce salad. For a main we spit the Ribeye and fries. The whole portion must be for that dude on the front of Brawny papertowels. It was perfect for two. Desert was great....but of course everything looks great with a candle sticking out of it.  \n\nI would go back here in a minute. Just to have a side with few drinks.

Tender, thinly sliced steak was topped with bell peppers and sauteed onions and drenched in white cheese.  All this cheesy, meaty goodness was served on a nice roll with a side of french fries.

I was looking for somewhere nice to go out to dinner in the city and he told me Town Hall had fantastic new American food.  It sounded interesting.  I went online and booked a table through their Open Table Reservation system, very convenient.  They were almost booked for the evening but I managed to get a table for two.  I was meeting a good friend who I had not seen in 10 years, and was greatly looking forward to a nice evening. I was already impressed with their website, and ease of reservations, but it was not to stop there.  \n     My friend had a change of plans and we were forced to dine later in the evening.  She called the restaurant and they were able to change our reservation for a half our later.  By the time I had picked her up and we got to the restaurant, it was 15 minutes past our reservation and I was worried we would be out of luck.  \n     I walked in to their entrance on Howard Street and was immediately amazed.  Their main dining room stretched out away from me with a beautiful bar along the left wall.  Rich hardwood floors met elegant white crown molding on the walls, supporting lovely windows that accented the rich redbrick walls.  And it was packed.  Servers were quickly weaving through the dining room rush, but I was immediately aware of the restaurant manager.  Her appraising gaze and calm demeanor instantly identified her.  Our hostess was a sweetheart.  Although she had marked us as a no show, she had us seated at a table in 4 minutes.   WOW.\n     The table was simply but ideally lain out, and we were soon seated amidst the rest of the well dressed and hungry guests.  Our server (Theodorus?sp) was fantastic, as was his support staff.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, was able to recommend a few items over others which I tremendously respect. It shows a server knows the menu and how to pair the guest with items they will love. I found a nice bottle of Spanish red for $50 and we settled in to catch up.  As a starter, we ordered the BBQ Gulf Shrimp with a Worcestershire sauce and garlic toast.  The kitchen split the appetizer for us and it was still a substantial portion.  3 large shrimp each, an the sauce was SOOOO good.  I would kill for the recipe.  Next, we decided to split a salad of butter lettuce, sliced pear, walnuts and Point Reyes blue cheese dressing. Split again and fantastic.  An elegant take on blue cheese dressing, it was lite but flavorful, and allowed the rest of the items to really shine.  We followed that with an entree each.  I had the Rabbit cooked 3 ways, served with greens, mashed potatoes and a coffee jus.  My friend had the porkchop.  The portions were great, as was the presentation.  The food was arranged elegantly without being molested into an awkward position on the plate.  The highlight of my plate was the rabbit saddle.  I could eat this every day.  Tender, rich, soft... I am lost for words.  The greens on the plate were perfectly cooked, the sauce was amazing.  I was hesitant at first about a coffee jus, but our server convinced me to try.  Im very glad I did.  The other preparation was a shredded rabbit that was molded, battered and deep fried. It was all right, I liked the textural difference that it added in the dish, having something nice and crisp.  I was slightly unimpressed with the 3rd preparation, which was a bone in rack of rabbit.  It was less than one bite.  Still, interesting and tasty.  My friends pork chop was huge, and faced the same problems any pork chop does... getting cooked enough without being dry.  I had a few bites and found it to be ok.  Nothing I would order again. We finished with a rocky road desert, which was amazing.  Rich, decadent, lush.  A great way to finish the evening.  I sat there with my double espresso wishing I could eat like this every day.

My favorite dish, which appears as an appetizer on the dinner menu, is offered as a sandwich for lunch. The warm Smithfield ham and cheese toast with poached egg and jalapeno cream sauce is definitely one of my top 10 lunches. Town Hall uses a whole wheat sourdough, drapes the ham on top, then blankets the whole thing in this delicious, rich jalapeno cream sauce, and tops it with a poached egg. The tang of the sourdough marries perfectly with the smoky saltiness of the ham. The jalapeno cream sauce is made by steaming some jalapenos to take out some of the heat but leave a little bit of bite and flavor, then adding lots of cream and butter and a little parmesan. Pierce the egg yolk on top of the sandwich and the combination is positively decadent. This is comfort food at its best and most fattening. \n\nBut I get ahead of myself.

I was surprised that the heavy and bold flavors common to American cusine didn't mask the quality of the main ingredients. As they should have, the sauces and sides accented the main dish without taking away from its grandeur. To the dismay of my company, our salad came out drenched in blue cheese dressing, which he describes as \"stale ranch.\" Although the butter lettuces had a great crunch to them, it was unfortunate that the dressing weighed down the individual leaves, making them soggy and inedible. I thought that maybe the heavy-handed dressing reflected the material excess of American culture, but probably should have sent it back [yes, it had that much dressing on it.]\n\nFrom my childhood memory, I vividly remember the experience of biting into an overcooked shrimp and feeling the individual body segments separate in my mouth--I stopped eating them for ten years. The anxiety of taking that first bite often crosses my mind now, but each of our five Worcestershire beauties ran contrary to all those bad impressions I've developed over the years. There's only a 30-second window of cooking when good shrimp turns bads and Town Hall managed to find that balance with precision.\n\nOur three jumbo sea scallops reminded me that scallops do not have to come in cream and cheese sauces. I tend to think scallops are extra chewy in a good way, but I now know what the true flavor and texture of a scallop is. These scallops were less \"flaky\" than I'm normally accustomed to and sans the cheese, I was finally able to perceive their subtle flavoring. Although the jambalaya was good and didn't overwhelm the scallops, it felt a little makeshift--as if they just mixed bbq sauce into rice. It was kind of a goopy mess.\n\nBy this time, my taste buds were telling me to give them a break and so I was a bit disappointed that there were no sorbets or light fruit options on the menu--only the decadance and indulgence of the heavy American palette. We opted to go with the bananas, since strawberry rhubarb was trite and since butterscotch&chocolate, marshmallow&peanut butter, and toffee&buttercream were all too much for our stuffed appetites. The pudding was very thick and although I felt like every bite was sending me to glutton hell, it was a successful marriage of two foods that I don't usually order for dessert.\n\nI would come back to Town Hall, even though I tend to prefer milder food.

"], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "Back when I first started Yelping, Town Hall was one of the most popular restaurants in SF.  It felt I would hear nothing but good things about the food and reservations always seemed to be a tough get (at normal dinner hours, anyways).  But now?  Oh how times have changed.\n\nNow, I don't necessarily mean that in terms of their food, though I have nothing to compare to.  Rather, I mean in terms of their popularity.  There still was a decent crowd on a Saturday night, but it wasn't exactly a full house either.  Not that I should really complain, since it meant we were able to snag a table for six the afternoon of.  Plus, I finally got to knock Town Hall off my list!\n\n-- TUNA TARTARE with Cornmeal Fried Green Tomatoes, Garlic Chips, Tabasco Green Onion Vinaigrette...$17\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=2IRYGeuG-2GwCRFsKmdbWQ)\nOverall, this was a pretty solid dish.  Although the tartare didn't amaze, it was still pretty decent and I liked the varied contrasts of the dish - the saltiness of the sauce, the freshness of the tuna, the spice of the vinaigrette, and the fried crunchiness of the green tomatoes.  \n\n-- TENNSHOOTOE, TN (?) COUNTRY HAM...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=IT4YBScgybGabBO4IiGuww)\nI *think* we ordered the Tennshootoe ham, but I'm not sure (my friends picked).  In any case, while I didn't get to try the biscuit (my friend said it was \"ehh...okay\"), the ham was good!  The cuts were sliced ever so thin, tender, a bit smokey, and just slightly salty (in a good way).\n\n-- ROASTED VEAL MEATBALLS with Potato Puree and Green Peppercorn Sauce...$15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=Y8bVLI1u56PaeDGwU7UO1Q)\nA perfectly fine rendition of a classic combo.  The sauce was great (really peppery/flavorful) and I liked how the meatballs had a nice balance between meaty and light/moist.  Despite all that, I'm not quite sure the dish warrants the price, especially since it wasn't all that amazing.\n\n-- BBQ SHRIMP with Worcestershire Sauce on Garlic Herb Toast...$17\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=RMSpacSdBzuYyAwwaJXRGQ)\nNot a bad dish, but, for $17, I was surprised it only came with one piece (albeit topped with a good amount of shrimp).  Even though the shrimp had a nice char on it, inside of the shrimp felt a little overcooked (not very juicy).  I did enjoy the toast (and sauce) quite a bit though.\n\n-- BUTTERMILK MARY'S FRIED CHICKEN with Baked Beans...$27\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=gpEcWOBDRp1q1rYpbjUB0g)\nAs a whole, the sides were just okay.  I don't recall their exact description, but I do know that the beans were fairly bland.  More importantly though, the chicken was terrific!  All three pieces were juicy, moist, and delicious.  Plus, the batter was just right - not too thick, not too thin, and very crispy.  Not sure it's the best fried chicken I've had, but it's up there.\n\nWhile the menu does change often, some dishes seem to stay the same or see only mild changes (e.g. the fried chicken is a staple, but the sides will vary).  In any case, there is an abundance of starters and entrees to choose from that is both modern and classic.  Just like with the decor, which makes Town Hall great for just about any occasion, from work dinners to dates.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS rounded up, though I initially wasn't so sure.  Town Hall is worthy of four stars based on food alone, but the prices for the starters is a little steep (good thing we were all sharing!).  However, considering how easy parking and reservations were, as well as how nice the service was, Town Hall is still more four stars than three.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-11-16"}, {"excerpts": ["For my entree, I had the tuna tartare.

With my friends, I had:\n-- Seared scallops, roasted butternut squash, chanterelles, quince, pumpkin vinaigrette ($29)\n-- Red snapper, \"pepper pot\", dirty rice, spicy peanuts ($26)\n-- Tuna tartare, cornmeal fried green tomatoes, garlic chips, Tabasco green onion vinaigrette ($15)\n-- Roasted veal meatballs, potato pur\u00e9e, green peppercorn sauce ($14)\n-- Chocolate and hazelnut crunch torte ($9)\n\nThe tuna tartare was average, I wasn't a fan of the chips at all.  The veal meatballs with mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing, the best part of the meal.  The snapper and scallops were also delicious.  Even the dessert was excellent.  Overall, the food was delicious - but given the high price tag, didn't exceed expectations.\n\nThe service was okay, though not as attentative as I'd have liked.  I had to ask many times for a refill on my soda.  They were good about taking 10 credit cards, which I always really appreciate.  Decor and ambiance was also quite nice.\n\nOverall, an outstanding experience, but with the total price tag of about $70 without alcohol, it's hard to give it 4 or 5 stars.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-01-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered oysters and tuna tartare for an appetizer....brillant!

Town Hall was really hot like 5 years ago and yet I never visited so I was pretty excited to catch-up.\n\nOverall the food was good but the service was really lacking. When we showed up at what we thought was the front entrance there was a bunch of people milling about with no apparent host or host station. It felt like we walked into some corporate event so we walked out and around the building thinking we were just at the wrong entrance. Nope. That was it. So we went back inside and still not host. Took a while for anyone to walk over and greet us. Our entire party wasn't there yet so we opted to wait at the bar. When they finally arrived and we wanted to be seated - again, the hosts had disappeared. After a few minutes I spied her chatting and talking with some friends to the side, pointedly ignoring us. Other people showed up looking confused and I had to let them know yes there was a host and they would be here eventually but they still look unconvinced. After 10-15 minutes she finally extricated herself from her socialization to come and seat us at our available table. So this was how the night started and how it continued. You know that feeling at a bar when the service is so slow that anytime the waiter appears you order another drink even if you still have a full one at hand? That's how it felt here. Service was slow. Food came out slow with long gaps in between.\n\nNow on to the food itself. A bunch of appetizers was shared by the table. Overall for $15 I would expect to get more than 3 tiny servings (approx 6 bites).\n\n* Tuna tartare - as expected, really can one go wrong with tuna tartare? I'm not a big fan of fried green tomatoes in general and Town Hall is no exception. Really hard green tomatoes with no flavor\n\n* Cornmeal fried oysters - best appetizer of the evening by unanimous vote and also the best fried oysters I've had. Super juicy and clean flavor.\n\n* BBQ shrimp - just plain weird. A few shrimp on top of a huge piece of toast soaked in sauce. Took people a while to figure out what this brown thing was under the shrimp. Looked very unappetizing so I didn't try it but it did disappear.\n\n* Buttermilk biscuits - pretty awesome if you make a sandwich by spreading the jelly on the biscuit halves and wedging the prosciutto in between. Only 3 tiny biscuits though for $14. Could really use more biscuits given the amount of prosciutto.\n\nMain courses are more solid. I had the soft shell crab with a side of crispy okra. The crab was really good. The crispy okra came out whole and the breading was a little too oily. Other people ordered the pork chop, duck breast and fried chicken and everyone liked what they ordered.\n\nDesserts were the opposite of the appetizers. Too much of a good thing. I got the butterscotch and chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me which was more like a bowl de cr\u00e9me. Gigantic cereal bowl of pudding. No one was able to eat more than half on their own.

We were seated in a corner, which was just fine because the tables are pretty close to each other.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers:  the tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes and the oxtail ravioli with english peas and shitake mushrooms.  The tartare was good, nothing special, but tasty.  The fried green tomatoes were, well, red.  They were obviously not green anymore, but more like underripe red tomatoes with a greenish tint (you know, the kind you avoid buying at the grocery store).  They didn't taste bad, but I always think if you're advertising green tomatoes, that's what should show up.  Also, the dish didn't really flow for me.  Why did they pair the tuna and tomatoes?  I thought it might be interesting, but it was just sort of ... meh.  My boyfriend liked the ravioli, but I was unimpressed.  Oxtail is delicious... but not in their ravioli.  It was ok but I definitely wasn't left wanting more.  \n\nI ordered the fried chicken for dinner, he ordered the gumbo with shrimp and sausage.  The chicken was great, and the smashed potatoes accompanying it were fabulous.  We make fried chicken at home every once in a while and it's fabulous, and this was almost as good, but not quite.  We had planned on sharing entrees and I was really bummed that I had to take the gumbo.  It was not good at all.  Having been in the south and cooked a lot of Southern food myself, this dish was just plain undesirable.  The flavor felt thin, and I just wished my boyfriend would give my fried chicken back.  \n\nWe also ordered hush puppies which were yummy on the outside (the part where it was crispy) but the inside was just kind of bland.  Also, there was no sauce served with them, so you ended up with a dry ball of cornmeal and nothing to dip it in.\n\nLastly, I ordered a latte that was just... weird.  I drink lattes daily from lots of places and this one tasted a bit burnt.  I can't remember the last time I sent a latte back, maybe never.  \n\nThe server was nice and very prompt, as were the bussers.  The atmosphere was nice and I had a great date, but it wasn't enough to win me over - the food just left something to be desired.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-03-25"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the tuna tartare as the appetizer, which was a bit spicy, but overall very tasty and met my expectations for what a good tuna tartare should be.

When we actually did finish though, the main course didn't come for another 15 minutes! \n\nMoving on to the main dish, I ordered the soft-shell crab sandwich to try something different, and this I wasn't very impressed with. The taste was a mixture of bland and starchy. The crab was crispy though, but it just didn't have much of a savory flavor to it. Disappointed with the crab, but some of the other hot entrees looked like they could be worth trying. \n\nThe best part was that check came in an actual book that some of the customers had even signed in the front or back.

With such a vibrant food culture, if you don't have a unique appeal or  \"wow\" factor then you're just another place that appeals to minute portion of the population who can afford to eat here and no longer the people.  In the end, it does serve its purpose but it really is all about the people.\n\nI do commend the service though.  I needed a private dining room for a party for a Thursday night and I had called on just that Tuesday before.  The coordinator was extremely efficient and quick in getting my menu set, contract approved, and even the tiny details.  Service on the day of the dinner was excellent was well.  They noticed that one extra person had showed up and swiftly set up another setting. \n\nYou should know that the private dining room upstairs requires a $2000 food and beverage minimum before tax and tip.  I wasn't sure if a group of 17 would be able to meet this but it did.  We chose a 4 course meal, 4 wines (multiple bottles of it), mixed drinks (from the full, standard bar), coffee, and tea.\n\nNow the reason for the 3 is because of the food.  I started out with a normal salad with peaches and a champagne vinaigrette which I thought was still too tart.  You have to each a bit of peach with every bite to balance it out.  Second dish was the tuna tartare which wasn't seasoned that intensely and you eat it with thinly sliced potatoes which doesn't add much to it either.  Third dish was the filet mignon which was cooked medium-well (I forgot to indicate how I wanted it) but still flavorful and tender.  Fourth was the infamous chocolate butterscotch pot de creme.

I really did.\n\nAnother entree option that night was the sea bass which turned out more like sea bream.  Usually this is served white, flaky, and plump but this was more like pan fried and like something you make at home.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed my time here.  The room is slightly bare bones, probably because we didn't have the amount of people to fill it.  I wouldn't recommend going under a party of 15 since this room can supposedly fill up to 40.  I do like that there are bathrooms and a bar just for us since we were upstairs.  It's nice to be removed from all the noise downstairs.

I thought this was prepared quite well, with just a hint of kick in the tartare itself.\n\nSalmon - It's not on the main lunch menu (i checked the website) but it came with a fruit-oriented sauce, over a white corn macque choux and okra.  I think this was favored over salmon, and it was delicious!  \n\nChicken Paillard Salad - tasty, but a salad is a salad.  It was a huge mountain of lettuce studded with big thick chunks of bacon (yum!), good ripe avocado cubes, and a mustard-based vinaigrette.  \n\nPot de creme - pretty much awesome in a jar.  The toffee was really the highlight, delicious and not to sweet.  I couldn't taste too much butterscotch, but it might be because the chocolate portion was pretty rich (and so good).\n\nSmores Tart - this is definitely for someone who loves chocolate.  It's really rich, as it's a wedge of essentially solid mostly bittersweet chocolate with a graham cracker crust and salted caramel marshmellow on top.  Most people that ordered it couldn't finish the chocolate part but seemed to enjoy the marshmellow and the crust.\n\nThe service was fine, though the server's quick movements when pouring water ended up in some water/ice getting flung onto my appetizer plate.

It didn't have a side, so we ordered the tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes as a starter.\n\nThe tuna/tomatoes were a pretty decent.  While I prefer a firmer tomato, the batter was lovely.

When I apologized for the rest of my party being a bit late, I was assured there was no hurry, and that I was welcome to sit at the bar until they arrived.  As I warmed the barstool, the informative bartender encouraged me to try new samples of things, and through her I discovered a new favorite - Old Tom gin.  When my family arrived, all smiles and joy, we were shown to our table.\n\nWhen dining out as a family, we always take the early seating (5:45 in this case) so other diners can enjoy some adult-only time afterwards.  We never felt rushed by the waitstaff despite lingering longer than most of the other family tables.

Sean? - it is a bit loud inside the charming brick walls) was excellent - though enthusiastic and cheerful, he never crossed the point of appropriateness.  \n\nAnd his guidance on the menu was honest and accurate.  Our 8 year-old daughter wanted the tuna tartare but was concerned the wasabi would make it too hot until we were assured that it could be toned down.

Drink these now, if you find any!\n\nSpeaking of the wine, the Sommelier (who helped create flawless service by assisting in other roles as needed) offered to decant and filter the wine, as there was a fair amount of sediment.

He comes back and sits down, pleased with his correct identification of the bread. The bread guy he assaulted swings over with another basket, and slaps a hand on my dad's shoulder, chuckling. This bread guy is my father's new best friend. \n\nSo, we get down to the Real Food. Butter lettuce salad, tuna tartare, fondue to start. Salad had slices of one of the crispest Fuji apples I've had in a while (I am a stickler for firm apples and have had horrible luck finding one the past few months). Tuna tartare was fresh and light, complete with fried green tomatoes, which I wanted to bury myself in, they were so delicious. Fondue was forgettable. \n\nAnd then, like a ton of bricks, they hit us. Both at the same time, both to share and fight over, both in the hands of a waitress who could not walk fast enough. \n\nFried chicken with corn, biscuits and gravy.\nSteak with white bean puree and a delectable, artery-clogging sauce. \n\nThe perfectly-breaded chicken was deceptively inviting; a knife through the center released a sinus-clearing cloud of steam, taunting my hungry stomach. The roof of my mouth was pissed, as I defied the thought to let it cool off, and inhaled the chicken. Unlike many, I've never been head-over-heels for fried chicken, but I can (did) definitely appreciate the combination of crispy outside, juicy inside. \n\nWell beyond full at this point, I ventured towards the steak. I rarely (HA. GET IT?) order a slab of meat for myself and so I didn't anticipate wanting much more than a few bites. One fork-to-mouth exchange and I was questioning why I would have ever made that assumption. Perfectly medium-rare, nice burst of mushroom and wine. I snuck the last bites before my father could slurp up the sauce. \n\nManufacturers make elastic waistbands for these occasions. We sat there in a communal food coma, waiting for someone to clear the empty plates that could have gone without a wash, they were so thoroughly cleaned. This is a good place to mention that service was sweet, but slow.  Part of why I had decided it suitable to eat anything presented to me (and more) was due to the fact that it took a LONG time to get it all out. Our waiter would zip by and apologize, but even my patient mother was getting a bit peeved. The only time this worked in our favor was after we had eaten the entire zoo, carousel, and gift shop. \n\nWith the passing time, we were able to digest and plan ourselves to further discomfort. My mother insisted we had to get the butterscotch pot de creme, based on her recent visit. \n\nI love my mother. \n\nThe majority of the food I mentioned above could be found elsewhere for a lesser price. However, the butterscotch pudding was worth every ache and pain my stomach growled out later that night. I considered getting my bag, silently unzipping it, tossing the bowl of rich butterscotch and chocolate into my bag, and RUNNING to the nearest alley so that I could be alone to lick every last drop. \n\nNot really my \"scene,\" I probably wouldn't go back just for a dinner. I would prefer to drop the dough in one of the many eclectic, smaller, just-as-delicious venues the city has to offer. \n\nThat said, if someone says \"pudding,\" you can rest assured my answer would be: \"TOWN HALL!\"", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-12-26"}, {"excerpts": ["For an appetizer, I had the tuna tartare that comes with lightly fried green tomatos.

But we went last night and it was the most satisfying restaurant experience I've ever had. \n\nAbout me: ex-chef, would much rather have a delicious, filling meal than a 2-ounce crazy chemistry experiement for $40. I'm pretty forgiving of waitstaff, take cocktails pretty seriously, but above all else I don't let small stuff get in the way of having a good time. I'm Anthony Bourdain but I don't like to travel.\n\nSo me and my lady were on our two-year anniversary. We got there about 45 minutes before our reservation hoping they had a bar, and they did. I had a Kentucky Gun and 710 Ashbury (both whiskey-based) and she had a Black Beauty and a Pim's something or other. All 4 were house cocktails, and well made, with an interesting balance of flavors, maybe not enough booze but then, I love a way-too-strong drink. On the list, the Kentucky Gun initially turned me off with the Tabasco, but there was a nice fruit-to-spicy transition in the drink. She liked both of hers, I think the best of the four was the Pim's whatever it was called. \n\nWe were sat on time at a small 2-person table (I'd left a note via OpenTable that we'd prefer not to get a communal table, since it was an anniversary, and it looks like they took care of us). Our server was friendly, informed, happy to give us more time even though we were seated around 9:30, and kept a smile all night. He had about the perfect balance of attention without being up our butts. I think his name was Javier -- Town Hall, if you're reading this, he was the best server I've ever had.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Cab, not one of their higher priced ones (I think it was $55) and I think it was probably obvious we weren't wine experts -- we might as well have thrown a dart at the list -- but it was a pretty good bottle. Server even beat me once to refilling her glass (it's a sin around here for me not to fill her glass).\n\nLike I said, I prefer to be satisfied than to be surprised, so I went with the Buttermilk Biscuits and ham starter. She had the Tuna Tartare. The biscuits were, without exaggeration, one of the favorite things I've ever eaten. The baked-to-order biscuits were deep-South-perfect, the Johnston ham was sliced incredibly thin and there was plenty of it, and the spicy, peppery jelly was an amazing complement. Slather some butter on a bite of biscuit, put some ham on there, and top it with the jelly, and I'm not kidding I may have never had more fun putting food in my mouth. She's a seafood freak, and was very impressed with the tuna. It was a bit spicier than she'd like, but she's incredibly sensitive to spicy, so that's not Town Hall's fault. It came with fired green tomatoes ( I think in a cornmeal crust or something) and they were spectacular. Both appetizers were rad.\n\nEntrees came out just in time. I was kinda surprised at the relatively basic plating of the entrees, but I have no problem with that. I feel like if you make the visuals too important you're not paying attention to the food enough. So \"basic\" is often, to me, a good sign. And I was right. Shit was on point. She got the Sole, I tried it and it was really damn good, especially the Concord grape reduction, but my New York steak was king of the night. I thought the meat itself had a bit of extra fat or silverskin in there, but that's what you get when you get it bloody. It was crispy on the outside, nice and red inside, and whatever the hell that sauce was, it was great. We were drinking, and I missed that detail. Mine even came with mushrooms, and I hate freaking mushrooms...but this time I cleaned my plate. Finally, this order was accompanied with a little iron pot of potatoes au gratin, and they were the kind you wish you'd grown up on. Share some fork space with the steak and the potatoes and that's what food should be, every meal. \n\nWe ordered the Butterscotch Pot de Creme, I got up to pee, and as I sat back down she says some other server guy had approached our table with a small plate, but turned away...she didn't know what was up...then here comes server #2 with a plate of three tiny cupcakes, \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate. It was an awesome thing to do (I guess they did see the OpenTable note!) and each cupcake was better than the last. We ate them in the order we thought we'd like them most: first a chocolate thing, then some cocnut German corporately thing, then something with nuts on top, and tuned out we liked them in reverse order of what we thought. Just as we finished, here came the Butterscotch pot, and it was incredible. Hard to describe, some kind of mix of butterscotch and chocolate creamy puddings with some crispy buttersctoch/toffee things floating on top. It was as ridiculous. We were both stuffed, but still I scraped the bowl clean. \n\nI'm out of characters, so, in short: perfect night.

I wasn't going to order the sandwich until I got suckered in by the melted brie, which makes nearly anything amazing. I opted for a sandwich rather than a regular entree because the two fish items somehow weren't working for me and I don't eat duck, beef, lamb or pork. I almost ordered the artic char dish, complete with butternut squash puree and a pomegranate reduction. But, the server couldn't tell me whether it was farmed or wild and whether that mattered.

If you're going to describe something as similar to salmon, you should be prepared  to answer the farmed or wild question.

Please keep reading . . .\n\nI took my friend to Town Hall for lunch to celebrate his passing the California Bar Exam (insert your favorite lawyer joke here).  We parked at the meter right in front of the entrance and walked in.  It was 11:30 am, so the place was pretty empty.  It filled up quickly, though; people just kept piling in.\n\nThe decor is beautiful in its simplicity: exposed brick, white wood siding, wooden tables and chairs, metal lighting fixtures.  It had that \"I bought a house on Cape Cod, remodeled it and moved it to SOMA\" feel.  The two styles were a bit eclectic for my taste, but it seemed to work for Town Hall.  I loved the water glasses and water pitcher they gave us: simple clear glasses with a gilded edge and a pitcher with a similar gilded pattern.  They made me think of my parents' dinner table from the days of yore.  Nostalgia at its best.  \n\nAlas, the food itself was neither eclectic nor original.  I had a butter lettuce salad with candied walnuts, radishes, bleu cheese and Fuji apples.  The dressing was bland, although there was a lot of it.  My friend had the tuna tartare . . .  I think my salad was a better value for the money.  The tuna was good, but . . . I'd compare it to sashimi from Todai, not tuna tartare from Aqua.  Trust me on that.\n\nFor my main course, I went with a Town Hall cheesesteak with french fries.  Tender, thinly sliced steak was topped with bell peppers and sauteed onions and drenched in white cheese.  All this cheesy, meaty goodness was served on a nice roll with a side of french fries.  The cheesesteak was delicious, but the french fries were not my cup of tea.  They were too crispy and too salty.  My friend had a pork chop, which was obviously overcooked.  I tried a piece, and it was not as tender as I would have expected.  The pork chop was served on the bed of spicy organic grits.  They were OK, but almost too spicy for that bland pork chop.\n\nOur waiter seemed somewhat disinterested in helping us, although the service wasn't bad.  They refilled my iced tea and my friend's Arnold Palmer promptly, but our request for more bread seemed to annoy them.  Interesting note: to refill my friend's Arnold Palmer, the waiter brought two pitchers--one with iced tea and one with lemonade--and poured them in a glass at the table.  I mean, I understand how the drink is made, but you don't see that every day.\n\nThey brought our check in . . . an old book.  It was an old, dog-eared hardcover edition of  \"Let Love Come Last\" by Taylor Caldwell.  What a cute, fun idea, to bring a check in an old book.  Almost made me feel like I didn't just spend $80 on lunch!  Apparently, the previous customers signed the first few pages of the book, much like one would sign a guestbook at a wedding.  \n\nI, too, am guilty of scribbling my note on page 3.

So when Jacey and I wanted to go to dinner - we decided upon this place and frankly, I was excited to try it out.\n\nA multitude of things went wrong.\n\nFirst -  we ordered wine.\nThe first bottle was a 94 Campillo Tempranillo - - $100+, can't remember how much exactly.  I think it was 125.  But the wine was 13 years old, and this was a good night, happy occasion - so I figured why not, especially since I forgot to bring a bottle of wine that I had wanted Jacey to try.  They decanted it upon bringing it to the table - and I tasted it, and something about it was not right.  I thought I'd let it breathe for a bit, but after some 15 minutes - - it tasted even more off.  I never, ever do this - but for the first time, I decided to return the wine and order something else.\n\nNow here is where things went sour.\nI was on the phone when the server came by - and JC tells her that this wine is not good.  The server asked if it was bad, or not good. (???)  JC answered that it was bad.  The server then takes the bottle and says she will go to the back and try it.  Now, I could care less if she chugged the whole thing - but if the customer tells you it's no good, then take it as that and offer something new - - her tasting it and then claiming it as superb is not going to make what we think is a wine-gone-bad into a great wine.  It just won't.  If we were people wanting to get more wine after downing 3/4 of the bottle, I get it.  Butwwe're barely able to finish one glass of wine each - - and we gave it a chance, and STILL, it sucked.  So then the sommelier comes over - - and tells us the wine is fine.  \"That's nice, I still don't like it,\" I tell him.\nNow, I won't knock the sommelier - - he informed us that wines from the Campillo winery simply taste like this, and so forth, while offering to exchange for us but recommending a different choice, some Spanish wine.  Coincidentally, that was what I had wanted - - but the server had told me that if it's a Rioja that I want, I best go with the 13 year old Rioja rather than that Spanish wine, which was my first choice.  He brought it out, decanted again -  and this one, we accepted.  It was alright - - but nothing anywhere near the caliber of wines I have at my house, costing 1/10th the price.  \nOH WELL, bad wine night.\n\nSecond, we ordered food.\nI'll say - the bread was good, the butter was good.\nThe beet salad we ordered had really good beets, but to get any flavor at all - - - we had to pour the salt on.  After eating about half, I look at Jacey and ask, \"WTF, is this bland or is it me?\"  She starts cracking up and we went nuts w/ the salt.  Ahhh... better.\nThe tuna tartare appetizer..... bland again, no appeal, and just nothing remotely memorable about it!  It came with some fried tomatoes that tasted like fried squash or something.... also bland.  \"GIMME THE SALT\".....\n\n\nThen came our entrees.  Jacey could not pick one to save her life - so she ended up ordering the second of the two choices I had been pondering, which was scallops.  I ordered the ribeye, medium-rare ($34?).  The steak was good - it was cooked exactly as requested, but accompanying it were really soggy tater-tot type of things, and string beans -  and this great hunk of meat was drowning in the sauce that accompanied it.  The sauce on its own was tasty, but the steak soooo did not need it.  What did strike me was that unlike the appetizers - -  this was nearing the point of being salty!  Hence, it had more flavor, and it was a good cut of meat w/ great marbling and very little CHUNKS of fat - - but I noted the inconsistency.  \nThe scallops.....\nWell, for some $28 (?), call me silly but I expect either really large scallops - - or if it's the average scallop size you're offering (which they are) - - give enough to make the person eating it not gawk.  THREE SCALLOPS with a mass of a barley concoction?  NO.  NO, NO, NO.\n\nTurned off.\n\nThird - dessert.\nNow WHY would we bother ordering dessert?  \nDon't be silly.............  I know how to take a hint.  Besides - by this point, JC was tipsied-out and laughing so much - and her laugh was cracking me up..... it started looking like delirium.\n\nOff to the Redwood Room we went to party it up, Mojito-style!

The food had always been good, and the service efficient and friendly - that is, from what I could remember, as it had been many months since my last visit.\n\nWe arrived about 10 minutes early for our 8:15 reservation - we weren't seated until after 8:30 as the party before us continued to linger well after paying their check. I ultimately recognize situations like this are beyond the restaurant's control, so while not ideal I certainly didn't start off with a bad impression.\n\nBad impressions, however, started to form after sitting down.\n\nOur waiter stopped by and asked if we wanted water while we looked over the menu - he returned about 5 minutes later with water and informed us they were out of a couple of items. My bf and I then needed a little bit of extra time deciding. When he returned we had a couple of questions: we asked for a recommendation between a couple of starters, asked what the substitution would be for one of the main courses as they were out of one of the items, and I asked about the preparation of one of the mains. Upon being asked the third question the waiter somewhat huffed and rolled his eyes: I tried to play it down as a non-issue, as I had prefaced the questions with \"I'm going to be a pain for a moment\" in a friendly way. I initially took his response as just sarcasm. As for drinks, the bf and I have been drinking a lot of wine lately, so we decided to skip alcohol for the evening: he stuck with water, I had an iced tea.\n\nWe ended up ordering the following:\n\nFaith's warm Smithfield ham and cheese toast with poached egg and jalapeno cream (shared)\n\nTuna tartare with fried green tomatoes, garlic chips, and green onion Tabasco vinaigrette (shared)\n\nFried buttermilk chicken with snap peas, mashed Yukon Gold potatoes, and bacon gravy (mine)\n\nStuffed pork chop with sun-dried tomatoes, fontina and mozzarella, dirty rice and bitter greens (bf's)\n\nThe food was \"good,\" not great. The ham and cheese toast was very good, just as I remembered it. I did use extra bread to soak up the cream. It was probably the best item we ordered. The tartare was decent: the flavors pleasant, the fish very fresh... however it was fairly boring in overall complexity. The fried chicken was very moist, though the skin wasn't nearly as crispy as I like (and was a bit on the greasy side). The sides were particularly skimpy, however the snap peas were perfectly cooked and the potatoes/gravy tasty. I tried the bf's pork chop: it was cooked to medium, moist and tender. He liked it, though wasn't particularly impressed.\n\nFood, overall, was good - I'd give it 2 - 2.5 stars ala Bauer's scale.\n\nThe service, however, was another story. After we placed our order we didn't see our waiter again until after we were done eating. The host brought out the appetizers - the busser essentially barked \"Are you done?\" before taking our plates. The mains were plopped in front of us - no one ever came by to ask how things were or whether or not we needed anything else. We sat with empty plates in front of us for quite some time. The waiter finally came by after the plates were cleared to present us with dessert menus: we'd already decided that we didn't care to remain through dessert.\n\nMind you, the restaurant was busy, though no more busy than usual. I frankly think the waiter \"sized us up\" after we asked questions/didn't order drinks and probably thought he could maximize his tip pull from other tables - so he ignored us.\n\nThe tab came to $94, including tax and tip. The tip, mind you, was just barely 15% - this was the first time in a VERY long time I considered leaving less. I typically leave 20-25% (or sometimes more for impeccable service). I'd probably give the service 1 star.\n\nThis was disappointing for me: I really enjoy Town Hall's younger sister, Salt House.

There are many potential downfalls starting with the scarcity of the proper ingredients, the recipes and cooking techniques, as well as the general concept of what the cuisine is all about, for starters. Town Hall wisely avoids all of the potential pitfalls in a variety of novel ways.\nFor starters the restaurant itself has a charming, rustic feel, with sturdy tables and wooden chairs and spectacular light fixtures. The crowd is a dressy but unpretentious  downtown sort that seem to have made this place a regular destination. The art is chic and appropriate, the music is fun, and the waitstaff is mostly efficient and attentive.\nI couldn't resist the starters so we had three course of them, six in all. An amazing tuna tartare studded with garlic chips and spiked with a red pepper hot sauce that was a perfect foil for the impeccably fresh tuna.

Mom and I had the Dorothy Parker (think lemony martini) and my sister got The Fine Line (tequila concoction). All drinks were superb and definitely refreshing.\n\nAs an appetizer we ordered several of the oysters recommended by our very nice waiter as well as the sardines. We had mixed reviews on the sardines, Dad and I really liked the smokey flavor, sister was not sold. The oysters were very tasty and fresh. We also split an order of the roasted beet salad (SO GOOD) but it definitely could have been bigger, or used more greens, there were just a few measly pieces of mache lettucs with beets mixed in with one goat cheese croquette to be found. Great flavors just lacking in size.\n\nAs an entree we all stuck with fish dishes, I had the grilled catfish with rice and okra, Dad had the fried Buttermilk Chicken (one of their staple dishes), sister had the Grouper and mom had the Sole. Everything was delicious but the real winners were the side dishes!! On the side, we made a game time decision and ordered the smoked andouille sausage jambalaya (salivating as I reminisce over this dish) as well as the cheese grits (so smooth and creamy). For a family of southerners, we were thoroughly impressed with these two side dishes, dishes that are hard to find this well done outside of the south.

I ate more of the jambalaya than I did my entree, honestly... if you love spicy and you love jambalaya... this is it!! Whew, okay, I'll stop.\n\nOn to dessert, we split an order of the 'Coffee and Donuts' as well as the Butterscotch and Chocolate Pots de Creme. Honestly, I could've done without both, neither of them knocked my socks off.

I was surprised that the heavy and bold flavors common to American cusine didn't mask the quality of the main ingredients. As they should have, the sauces and sides accented the main dish without taking away from its grandeur. To the dismay of my company, our salad came out drenched in blue cheese dressing, which he describes as \"stale ranch.\" Although the butter lettuces had a great crunch to them, it was unfortunate that the dressing weighed down the individual leaves, making them soggy and inedible. I thought that maybe the heavy-handed dressing reflected the material excess of American culture, but probably should have sent it back [yes, it had that much dressing on it.]\n\nFrom my childhood memory, I vividly remember the experience of biting into an overcooked shrimp and feeling the individual body segments separate in my mouth--I stopped eating them for ten years. The anxiety of taking that first bite often crosses my mind now, but each of our five Worcestershire beauties ran contrary to all those bad impressions I've developed over the years. There's only a 30-second window of cooking when good shrimp turns bads and Town Hall managed to find that balance with precision.\n\nOur three jumbo sea scallops reminded me that scallops do not have to come in cream and cheese sauces. I tend to think scallops are extra chewy in a good way, but I now know what the true flavor and texture of a scallop is. These scallops were less \"flaky\" than I'm normally accustomed to and sans the cheese, I was finally able to perceive their subtle flavoring. Although the jambalaya was good and didn't overwhelm the scallops, it felt a little makeshift--as if they just mixed bbq sauce into rice. It was kind of a goopy mess.\n\nBy this time, my taste buds were telling me to give them a break and so I was a bit disappointed that there were no sorbets or light fruit options on the menu--only the decadance and indulgence of the heavy American palette. We opted to go with the bananas, since strawberry rhubarb was trite and since butterscotch&chocolate, marshmallow&peanut butter, and toffee&buttercream were all too much for our stuffed appetites. The pudding was very thick and although I felt like every bite was sending me to glutton hell, it was a successful marriage of two foods that I don't usually order for dessert.\n\nI would come back to Town Hall, even though I tend to prefer milder food. It feels good to be back on the restaurant scene.", "rating": 4, "date": "2006-08-31"}]}
