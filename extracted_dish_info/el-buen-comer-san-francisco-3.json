El Buen Comer started when the owner (Chef Isabel) sold her delicious food from her Tenderloin apartment and in the Noe Valley's farmers' market. Eventually, she was able to open up El Buen Comer -- her first restaurant! \n\nI came here with a group of 6 for lunch on a Saturday. We made reservations, but there was plenty of room for us even if we didn't. The ambiance was spacious and had a relaxing and cute atmosphere. The service was great -- our waitress was super friendly and accommodating. \n\nMy friends and I decided to order different items on the menu and share. The food portions were smaller than expected, especially for the price. However, the quality of the food was incredibly tasty and made with care.\n\nWE ORDERED:\n- Chips and Guacamole: chips are from their homemade tortillas. The guacamole is avocado, cilantro, lime, with cubes of queso fresco on top. Very light and fresh tasting. \n\n- Mole Verde de Puerco: pork stew in a sauce made from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos, cilantro and epazote. One of my favorites! The pork was tender and the sauce was thick and creamy. \n\n- Chilaquiles Rojos o Verdes: crispy corn tortillas smothered in either homemade salsas and topped with egg or chicken. Another one of my favorites! It wasn't greasy or soggy. \n\n- Pollo en Morita: Braised chicken in a chile morita sauce. \n\n- Chicken Taquitos Dorados: another favorite! My friends and I were so full, but decided to still get these. We did not regret it. \n\n- Tinga Taco: pulled chicken simmered in tomato, onion & chipotle. Really delicious chicken and sauce. \n\n- Churros: comes with chocolate sauce for dipping. Not too sweet, but still a light dessert.\n\nAlthough it's a bit pricey, you pay for the quality.

If you see someone dining alone, please don't pity them. Many do it by choice. While I use to get major anxiety from it, I now relish the serenity, not to mention the solo foodgasms. \n\nEl Buen Comer opened in early June and I've been eyeing this place because I read that the owner started a restaurant out of her living room in the TL. With the help of La Cocina, she started doing pop-ups at the Noe Valley Farmer's Market and now has her first brick and mortar in Bernal Heights.\n\nEl Buen Comer serves up authentic, Mexican food - none of that overpriced hipster Mexican food (e.g. Tacolicious, Mateo's, Padrecito, Velvet Cantina). Their specialties are guisados, slow-cooked stews. Don't have your heart set on anything you see on their online menu because the menu changes daily. I wish they could post on social media their menu for the day since a lot of people do choose restaurants based on the menu and their dietary restrictions. \n\nI initially came in for the Mondongo, tripe stew that I saw on their online menu but they didn't have that. The only guisado they had for the day was a pork mole. I wasn't feeling pork so I decided to order something I normally wouldn't: Milanesa de Res, a breaded beef filet ($14) which was served with rice, black beans, salad: http://bit.ly/29L0EM0 and housemade tortillas: http://bit.ly/29RmH4z. \n\nThe milanesa was lightly breaded and had a jerky-like texture because it was pounded so thin (I think I ordered wrong). The rice and beans were simple and enjoyable, as were the freshly made, thick, hot corn tortillas. The salad was my favorite part of the dish. The greens were perfectly dressed in a creamy and tangy dressing, and I liked the tart crunch from the apples. Portions were fine for me but I don't think this would be filling for a hangry man. \n\nI had to sample more than one thing from the menu so I also ordered two Sopes: Chicharron and Tinga de Pollo ($3 each): http://bit.ly/2a6hqqG. Initially, I thought they were going to be super small like the ones at Cala but these sopes were sizeable (4 bites vs. 1 bite) and super delicious with the duo of salsas. Both were savory, flavorful, and had great texture. The chicharron was my fav as I love pork rinds. \n\nService was super friendly, prompt, and attentive since I was one of three tables there at the time. \n\nLoved the contemporary rustic space - high ceilings, wooden furnishings, open kitchen, and teal tiling. Great for a casual date or for a large group dinner. \n\nParking is easy during lunch on the weekdays and weekends but can be a nightmare at night. \n\nI hope the owner considers posting their daily menu on social media because I really want to try one of their guisados.

The guacamole comes with their signature chips, I can only surmise are made from their own hand made tortillas, some of which souffl\u00e9 up and make themselves into little guac scoops!  Its a must-order.\nWe tried three different kinds of sope, though you can choose from taco, sope, or tostada, each on the home made masa base you decide on.  We picked chicken tinga, cactus(nopales), and chicharr\u00f3n.  All were really amazing.  That chicharr\u00f3n is not the crispy kind, its more like a lovely tripe, not for the weak of heart, but for the experience, its right in the zone.  This all comes out on beautiful clay plates and a small bowl of their potent green sauce, which you only need to augment the food with a drop of.  Any more, and you throw off the existing balance.\nIsabel's food is homey but everything on each plate is seasoned with care.  Rice and sumptuous black beans accompanied chicken chilaquiles, and it was a symphony of flavor, with the lead violin being played by the spicy salsa roja.  Nothing lacked, and there is no greasy soggy undesirable, oh no, quite the opposite, se\u00f1orita, its a plate-licker.
