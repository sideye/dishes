The shrimp is stretched out like a piece of tempura and wrapped with an egg roll. Cute, simple and delicious with sweet plum sauce. \n\nToong Egern: minced chicken and vegetable wrapped in a pouch served with cucumber salad. Not a big fan of this. The chicken and vegetables are made into this curry filling, seems like there are potatoes in it too. The flavor is bland but presentation was nice. They're wrapped and tied together like a little bag of treats. \n\nMy main dish was the Kao Soy with egg noodles topped with yellow curry chicken, pickled green mustard and red onions. It was listed under noodle soup and it was far from soup! The  noodles are mixed in a rich, thick curry that you really can't drink with a spoon. It was more suacey than soupy.

Very tasty.  \n\nChan Pad Poo - stir-fried spicy thai noodles with dungeness crab meat, egg and green onions.  Basiclaly Pad Thai with crab in it.  SO GOOD, but we asked for medium spiciness and, I'm tellin' you, it was WAY too spicy for my non-spicy taste buds.\n\nPla Muk Gra-Tiem - saut\u00e9ed squid with garlic and pepper, served with mixed vegetables.  The squid was nice and peppery.  The mixed vegetables was basically some raw sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce.\n\nPla Pao - grilled marinated salmon wrapped in banana leaf, served with chef's secret sauce.

Check. Friendly customer service? Check. Amazing, mouthwatering food? Check.

I've had my fair share of hockey-puck dry fish cakes and these were definitely not that. It was delicious.\n\n- Crispy fried calamari served with sweet and sour sauce ($8.95): ooooohhh yeah, these were good. The coating on the calamari is different than those used in mainstream chain restaurants. It's lighter in color and taste; it's more of a pale yellow than dark brown color. The calamari to coating ratio was 3:1 instead of 1:1.\n\n- Chicken satay ($7.95): pretty standard but they done it right. Again, I had my fair share of dry chicken satay but they cooked these perfectly. I couldn't get enough of the peanut sauce! I dipped the crispy calamari into the sauce because it's THAT good.\n\nCurries:\n- Boneless duck in red curry with tomatoes, pineapple, and basil ($12.95): who doesn't like duck? It goes well in this curry; I can't imagine duck in a yellow or green curry. Forewarning: it's a bit spicy!\n\n- Pumpkin curry with beef in medium red curry sauce with bell pepper and basil ($11.95): MY FAVORITE DISH. I don't know what it is but the pumpkin curry is magical. It's not too sweet nor spicy - it's just... I don't know, I'm at a lost of words. You just have to try it for yourself.\n\nStir-fried/entrees:\n- Pad Thai ($10.95): Self-explanatory if you already know what pad thai is. My friends think that every pad thai taste the same but na-uh, that's where they're wrong. I think Amphawa has the best pad thai in all of SF.\n\n- Pad Kee-Mao - flat rice noodles with beef, onions, chili, chinese broccoli, and basil ($9.95): a bit on the sweeter side. It can be a bit oily but hey, it's a stir-fried dish. It needs a little bit of oil to combine and coax all of the ingredients into one cohesive dish.\n\n- Fried chicken over rice with sweet and sour sauce ($9.95): another self-explanatory dish. Their coating is lighter but somehow it makes the coating crunchier! I ain't complaining.\n\n- Steamed chicken over garlic rice ($9.95): a healthy option does exist! The chicken is soft and has a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. My favorite part of this dish is the garlic rice though. After everyone was done sampling a piece of the steamed chicken, there was a mount of garlic rice left. I scooped some up and ate it with the curry dishes - tastes just as good.\n\nDesserts:\n- Panna cotta with mango sauce - oh lawd, have mercy!\n- Sweet sticky rice with vanilla ice cream - mango isn't in season so we settled for ice cream.

The roti had the perfect consistency and I liked the sauce, even though It could have been a little thicker to help it stick to the roti.\n\n-- #48 KAO KA-PROW MOO KROB - Sauteed Crispy Pork Belly with Chili, Onions, Bell Peppers, and Basil over Rice...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#FWBdUHFgev8be6VHkyADQw)\nAs a pork belly fanatic, this was easy for me to enjoy.  Every piece was so juicy and I loved how flavorful the sauce was.  Slightly sweet with just a touch of spice.\n\n-- #102 CRISPY CHICKEN & FRIED RICE served with Sweet & Sour Sauce...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#D-iaGL2nrYWN8-ELzg7U0A)\nThe chicken wasn't bad (a little dry, very crispy), but they gave me white rice instead of fried rice.  What's worse, when I told our server, she tried to argue that's how it's served, despite the menu saying otherwise.\n\n-- #70 CHAN PAD POO - Stir Fried Spicy Thai Noodles with Dungeness Crab, Egg, and Green Onions...$12.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#Nj4pE-SxbUn9M51mZ_4bSw)\nOne of my favorite Thai dishes, and it's pretty awesome here.  The portion is deceptively large and has the perfect spiciness.  Plus, there's so much crab!\n\n-- #41 KAO MOO KROB - Crispy Pork Belly & Chinese Sausage Topped with Secret Gravy Sauce...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#NQ8MfrLnJv8UDmo75aj9NA)\nIt felt more Chinese than Thai, but decent nonetheless.  The pork belly's skin was really crispy and the sausage was so juicy.\n\n-- #50 KOR MOO YANG - Grilled Pork Shoulder with Chili Sauce...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#OgTID8EG6Uzpznbp53bftw)\nIt's served a la carte, so I added a side of brown rice for $2.  Some pieces were a little fatty, but the dish as a whole was really tender and flavorful.\n\n-- #13 KEAW TOD - Fried Shrimp and Pork Wonton served with Sweet and Sour Sauce...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#613AHUVN8M70rkvxC72_kQ)\nThe wontons were a bit dark (couldn't tell if it tasted overcooked or if the oil was old), but the filling was pretty tasty.\n\n-- #77 AMPHAWA NOODLES - Flat Rice Noodles topped with Ground Chicken, Green Bean, Onions, & Bell Peppers...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#E18eA3UzZ7KxKaQ4wyhMnA)\nWe subbed out the chicken for beef, but either would've been good.  The noodles were soft and feathery and the dish was well seasoned.  Really good!\n\n-- #108 PRA RAM - Choice of Meat (Chicken) & Mixed Vegetables with Peanut Sauce...$11.95 (a la carte)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#dlFG4WbMfDkVvxF6WPkHvw)\nIt wasn't bad, but I wasn't a fan.  It was certainly better than the last version I had, but I think I just prefer not having my veggies and chicken covered in peanut sauce.\n\n-- ROTI & ICE CREAM...$5.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#O6wff5PTAozXVj6i84wpIw)\nThis roti had the prefect texture as well, and the ice cream was terrific!  There could have been a little more condensed milk, but that's always true.\n\nWhileI love Amphawa, I'm regrettably rounding down from FOUR AND A HALF.  Most of what I've had has been better than solid, but it's hard to overlook the few dishes that were just okay.  Not that I won't be coming back, especially since I haven't seen that one worker.

I order this to be \"healthy\" but it's not really a salad, just a lot of silver noodles with some lettuce leaves. I'm not really sure what to do with the lettuce leaves.. sometimes I clumsily wrap the noodles in it. The dish is very flavorful and not too heavy. Don't make the mistake of ordering it medium spicy like I did one time because it was way too spicy and I could hardly enjoy it. Order it mild unless you have a very good tolerance.\n\n2) Kao pad goon-chiang: one of the best fried rice dishes I've had!

Service was good... although the restaurant is rather small, the two servers worked non-stop to make sure all tables were tended to.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-07-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Very Reasonable Priced too, The Thai Fried Rice is Spot on and ", "the Cocktails are really good, Try The Strawberry Mojito"], "author": "Chris H.", "review": "GREAT Authentic Thai Food, Very Reasonable Priced too, The Thai Fried Rice is Spot on and the Cocktails are really good, Try The Strawberry Mojito", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-02-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Pad Thai chicken\nChinese sausage fried rice\nNoodle soup with ground pork--amazing flavor!!!"], "author": "Lola D.", "review": "I was being a total fattie with my group again.

The delivery man seemed really upset as no one was tipping him because of the long delays.   Amphawa really needs an additional delivery person.   Do not order delivery if you are really hungry.  It would be faster to bus/drive/walk there.\n------\nI am going to go against my usual rule and am knocking off a point for service. \nIn this case, we had ordered delivery.  The person on the phone suggested it would be 45 minutes.  I called them at the 1.5 hour mark and asked if anything could be done to compensate for the additional 45 minutes of wait time.    After figuring out who I was,  which took a while and involved her taking my address down again (I would have assumed they lost my address, but it was in their computer system when I had called initially since I was a repeat customer).   \nThe food showed maybe 3 minutes later.  Absolutely cold.   Nothing done about the bill.   The delivery man seemed apologetic saying that they were busy.     If the wait is going to be doubled they really need to call and warn the customer.    \n1.5 hours for cold Thai food when I am only 14 blocks away is pretty bad.  \n\nThis would be an ideal opportunity for the business to respond to me personally.  \n\nOtherwise I think there food is pretty good.

I used to live in SF and recently moved back from NYC. Man, definitely the food is much better in here than New York, overall. Found this gem by accident, everything that we ordered were flavorful. Although I would say, the salmon curry was too watery. They should thicken little bit and less water. It looked like the ingredients swimming in the curry. Taste wise still very good. The mango salad is so yummy, not too salty like other places nor too sour. The garlic shrimp w rice also very good, wished bigger portion, lol. I will return soon. Waitress is friendly.
