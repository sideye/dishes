(Hi Dad, if you happen to be reading...don't worry, I mean Vienna sausages.)\n\nFormerly Thai Idea (second location), a vegan and vegetarian restaurant, Sweet Basil Thai is their carniwhorous sister restaurant by the same owners according to the staff. They still have faux meat available for all their dishes but decided to change their name since they offered meat dishes. Sweet Basil also has a location on Haight street and in Foster City. \n\nSweet Basil is definitely a neighborhood restaurant in Bernal Heights as it's not a destination restaurant. Finding street parking is awfully frustrating if you come after 6 pm on the weekdays or anytime on the weekends. Since Safeway is across the street, you can always buy a pack of gum which then technically makes you a \"customer\" so you can park in the lot for 90 minutes. Just a thought but park there at your own risk. \n\nJust like Thai Idea in TL, you can count on the wonderfully friendly service, trendy and sleek atmosphere, and beautiful presented dishes at reasonable prices. The menu ($6.95-$16.95) has a good selection of soups, salads, appetizers, curries, entrees, seafood, noodles, and chef specialties but they seem to be more of Americanized dishes which is not surprising given the area. \n\nI love Thai Idea in TL so I thought I would love their carniwhorous sister even more especially since they also don't use MSG and have brown rice available (my review: http://bit.ly/1aWSTNo). Disappointingly, I wasn't a fan of Sweet Basil's meat and fish dishes because they weren't well executed. I probably would have liked their faux meat more assuming it's prepared like their sister restaurant in TL. \n\nAs suggested by other Yelpers, we ordered the Massaman Curry ($8.95): http://bit.ly/1aWQYIH. We ordered it with duck for an extra $2. Deliciously rich, coconutty, and peanutty, the robust Massaman Curry was our favorite of the night. The duck could have been cut more thoroughly (pieces were stuck together) but it was very tender. This went very well with brown rice which soaked up all the yummy curry sauce. \n\nUnfortunately, things went downhill after this. The Volcanic Beef ($12.95) was pleasing to the eye but not the palate: http://bit.ly/1ce9q2A. There was no sear on the beef cubes making them incredibly chewy. I'm not a fan of OSHA Thai but I prefer their rendition over Sweet Basil's.\n\nThe Ginger Fish ($13.50) arrived on a bed of veggies with cornstarchy gravy: http://bit.ly/15bAe0w. There wasn't much ginger flavor but there were tons of button mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. Just odd and not how I envisioned it based on the menu description. My biggest gripe was the batter they used; it was heavy and cakey which really compromised the delicateness of the fish fillets.\n\nThe wine started talking to me so the Fried Bananas w/ Ice Cream ($5.95) was ordered for dessert: http://bit.ly/18MWaOm. To be frank, it was just awful. The same heavy and cakey batter was used for coating the bananas and the accompanying ice cream was ultra icy and ironically wasn't creamy.\n\nI hope they work out the kinks with their frying batter and meat preparation because they DO have an edge over their next door competitor (Pad Thai Restaurant) when it comes to faux meat options and using no MSG. IMO, it would be nice to see a couple of more popular and authentic Thai dishes like Ko Mu Yang: Grilled Pork Shoulder on the menu. Or even Sai Oua: Thai Sausage.

I have to give Sweet Basil 5 stars...\n\nIt was Tuesday night.  I'd been craving Thai food all day, but couldn't decide if I should give in or make something @ home instead.  I finally decided to just go for it.  But now it was almost 9:30...\nI call in to see if it's too late to place an order for pick up, since they close at 10:00.  The gentleman that took this call suggested delivery.  Problem was we are out of their delivery range.  He then says they'll deliver it anyway, if I don't mind a small delivery fee.\n\nOf course I don't mind.  I don't mind at all.\n\nHe says...\nWhy not stay nice & warm at home?\nNo rushing.  No driving.  No parking (on mission?  That's a laugh)...just relax & let them take care of it?  Uh...is this a trick question?  You don't have to ask me twice!\n\nHe then tells me he'll put my order in pronto, & that we'll be the last delivery of the night...no biggie.\n\nWhy can't everyone be this accommodating & everything be this easy?\n\nThe food arrived @ 10:00!  What?!  And everything was correct...\nDuck egg rolls.\nThai samosas.\nSpicy basil pork.\nSpicy fried rice w pork.\nJasmine rice.\n\nIf you like duck, you'll love the duck egg rolls.  If you love Indian samosas, you'll like these.  The Thai version are just smaller, without the peas in the filling, & a tad less spicy.  Delicious!  I wolfed down 2 of them before I even brought out the plates & silverware for crisake!  The basil pork was the only dish that I didn't find exceptional; the flavor was on point enough but it was way overcooked.  The spicy fried rice w pork was perfect.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly spicy, perfectly moist.  It was so good I'm salivating just thinking about it.  We loved it.\n\nThis was the most personable phone order I have ever experienced.  This guy was downright charming.  Absolutely gracious.  He was funny.  He was sweet.  He didn't rush me.  Considering the fact that I called just a half hour before closing time on a sleepy weeknight, that is beyond impressive.  \n\nSo...\nextraordinary phone side manner, lightening speed order to delivery time, & the food being above par, well...\n\nThat's why I have to give them 5 stars.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered pumpkin curry, sweet and sour chicken (Thai style) and spicy fried rice.
