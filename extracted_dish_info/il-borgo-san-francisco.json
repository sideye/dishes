My sweetie loves that she speaks Italian to him. \n\nThere is a gray-haired waiter who once gave my group complimentary shots of Grappa, \"the national drink of Italy\" he said.

We always laugh about that experience.\n\nHowever one time that same talkative waiter said some rather inappropriate things to my sweetie and I, and we felt a little uneasy for the rest of the dinner and for the next few times we were there. He must be a cousin or something that the owners feel they must keep on the payrol. Well, that's the story we made up about it.

Usually, when I'm coming off the Bay Bridge to go home, my route off Octavia leaves me stuck at a red light at Fell and Laguna.  During those 30 seconds, as I wait for the light to turn green, I would sit and wonder if Il Borgo was any good.  Just as I tell myself that I'm going to finally check them out though, the light changes, I go on my way, and I forget that Il Borgo even exists.  That is, until I'm stuck at that light again.  So when my friend recently suggested we go to Il Borgo for dinner, my immediate thought was \"Where the hell is that?\".\n\nWhen we arrived, it was nice that we were seated immediately, but it kinda sucked that our table was right next to the door.  Since it was such a cold night, there was a bit of a chill whenever someone walked in or out.  Skimming the menu, I was impressed to see they offered a good mix of dishes and at prices that are pretty reasonable compared to other Italian joints in SF.  Since we wanted to share a couple of dishes, we ordered the Funghi e Salsice pizza (mushroom and sausage) and the Spaghetti Carbonara.  \n\nAlthough the portions were pretty good for the price, our food left me conflicted.  The pizza tasted pretty good, and I liked how they didn't skimp on the toppings, but man was it oily.  Sure, there was sausage on it, but wow.  Plus, since the crust was so thin, the slices were kinda limp and soggy with oil.  As for the pasta, I really liked the pancetta (how can you not?), but I thought the sauce fell short.  Maybe this is the was it's supposed to be made, but it reminded me more of an alfredo dish than the spaghetti carbonaras I've had in the past.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, especially since the waitress (the owner?) was the only one taking care of each table.  It's a slight bummer that the place is CASH ONLY, but I think I saw an ATM towards the back (there are probably fees though).

Usually, when I'm coming off the Bay Bridge to go home, my route off Octavia leaves me stuck at a red light at Fell and Laguna.  During those 30 seconds, as I wait for the light to turn green, I would sit and wonder if Il Borgo was any good.  Just as I tell myself that I'm going to finally check them out though, the light changes, I go on my way, and I forget that Il Borgo even exists.  That is, until I'm stuck at that light again.  So when my friend recently suggested we go to Il Borgo for dinner, my immediate thought was \"Where the hell is that?\".\n\nWhen we arrived, it was nice that we were seated immediately, but it kinda sucked that our table was right next to the door.  Since it was such a cold night, there was a bit of a chill whenever someone walked in or out.  Skimming the menu, I was impressed to see they offered a good mix of dishes and at prices that are pretty reasonable compared to other Italian joints in SF.  Since we wanted to share a couple of dishes, we ordered the Funghi e Salsice pizza (mushroom and sausage) and the Spaghetti Carbonara.  \n\nAlthough the portions were pretty good for the price, our food left me conflicted.  The pizza tasted pretty good, and I liked how they didn't skimp on the toppings, but man was it oily.  Sure, there was sausage on it, but wow.  Plus, since the crust was so thin, the slices were kinda limp and soggy with oil.  As for the pasta, I really liked the pancetta (how can you not?), but I thought the sauce fell short.  Maybe this is the was it's supposed to be made, but it reminded me more of an alfredo dish than the spaghetti carbonaras I've had in the past.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, especially since the waitress (the owner?) was the only one taking care of each table.  It's a slight bummer that the place is CASH ONLY, but I think I saw an ATM towards the back (there are probably fees though).

There was nothing to spread onto our bread or dip it into, although after looking around at other tables, I saw that we just seemed to be missing our olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and their accompanying dipping dish.

The tomato sauce tasted stale and was severely lacking in flavor--I had to douse my food in red pepper flakes to taste ANYTHING. My fettuccine was oddly dense and definitely did not taste fresh at all. The WORST part: the chicken. Not only was it completely tasteless, the texture was so off-putting--soft and jelly-like, almost like tofu. One of my friends who also ordered this dish agreed wholeheartedly. The last time I checked, chicken is supposed to be...I don't know, fibrous? At least chewable. I don't think I've ever had chicken so strange and inedible in my life.\n\n-- Service (TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE): As a party of seven, we asked the server (ostensibly the owner) to split our checks.

The food was quick, as in the second we were done with the caprese our ravioli arrived. When we were done we sat and finished our wine and it was nice. There was some drum and bass playing, which I found a little odd, but I didn't really notice it after a while.\n\nUnfortunately, they are a cash only business. Having to double-check at the door that you have enough cash is a little annoying, but I'd say the food is worth it. Not sure why they do this, though.

There were two waiters working that night neither of which paid any attention to us as we waited.  My friend got one of their attention and asked for another glass of water.  We read the menus which were already on the table and made our decision.  Waited and waited. Then a sort of unkempt older guy comes over wearing jeans and wrinkled shirt with a green apron haphazardly tied and asked us, I think, if we were ready to order. (He looked more like a short order cook than a waiter).  No greeting of any kind! I asked for a glass of wine and he named the three wines of which I could only make out \"Grigio\" as the place was buzzing with conversations from other tables and with his accent it was hard to make out what he was saying. I ordered the penne mushroom and sausage with Italian sauce and my friend ordered the lobster ravioli. This \"waiter\" was very preoccupied his manner was one of impatience and he seemed irritated about something. He was not pleasant.

My friend's vegetable soup looked delicious and I was a bit sorry I passed on the soup, but I knew I had a pizza in my near term future.\n \nThe service was quite good, especially considering the crowd in this small restaurant. \n \nGood Italian food at a good price, is reason enough to return to Il Borgo.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-04-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Another notable dish was Vitello Saltimbocca ($18.75, Veal scaloppini in Marsala wine, sage, topped withprosciutto and mozzarella).

This is a cozy, casual restaurant which seems to fill up quickly on Friday night, so a reservation is probably recommended.  \n\nLasagnetta was excellent and I'd definitely recommend it  ($12.75, Rolled lasagna filled with prosciutto and mozzarella).  Another notable dish was Vitello Saltimbocca ($18.75, Veal scaloppini in Marsala wine, sage, topped withprosciutto and mozzarella).  Also I liked Mista ($6, Romaine lettuce, radicchio, arugula with Italian house dressing & fresh herbs), which I thought was really fresh and yummy.\n\nDidn't get to the dessert section as we were quite full, but heard that Tiramisu is also home-made.  I'm definitely going to try it the next time.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-09"}], "vitello al marsala": [], "agnello scotta dito": []}
