Earlier tonight, my wife and I waited just a few minutes for perfect seats at the center of the sushi bar, right in front of the head sushi chef.  For a Friday night, the place was understandably busy.  We could see most of the other food going to other customers were a variety of maki rolls and other entrees.  Our interest was pure and simple:  nigiri, and lots of it!\n\nThe meal was surprisingly sublime.  The fish was cool, tender, fresh, and properly seasoned as appropriate, while the rice was perfectly room temperature, with the right balance of chewiness, smoothness, and subtle vinegar flavor.  We believe we were at an advantage with our close proximity to the head sushi chef.  The time from him making the nigiri to it entering our mouths could literally be measured in seconds.\n\nOur favorites were the anago, the bonito, and the escolar, all bursting with flavor and wonderful mouth feel.  They were so good, we doubled up on those orders.  \n\nAlso good were the hotate, the kampachi, and the toro.  Less impressive, but still good, was the saba.  The hamachi sashimi was very nice.  The sunomono was good as well - I enjoyed the fresh piece of taco (octopus) from it.\n\nThe chef did comp us a special piece of toro with a nori wrap, no rice, and some sort of light color salty sauce.  That was quite nice of him.\n\nFor comparison, my wife and I commented to each other that this nigiri meal easily beat recent similar meals at Kabuto and Nagano on Geary St., and Higuma in Redwood City.  While not cheap, it was well worth the cost.\n\nPerhaps our experience would not have been as good if we had not sat at the sushi bar, nor focused on nigiri, but since we thoroughly enjoyed this one meal, and I've had good experiences before at Fuji, I'm assigning a 5 star rating.

I've been back here twice since and the first time back was better than the second but I went there with family members on Sunday and it was clear to me that the food and service are very much compromised; I don't even know if it's the same ownership! different cooks, waiters, everything!\n\nFor starters, I wanted the combination box number one; teriyaki chicken/mixed tempura with a few pieces of tuna sashimi, sushi with wasabi on the side and something that are like fried wantons or pot stickers that I didn't care for and white rice.\n\nI had that specific meal on my previous trip to Fuji and thought it would be an almost perfect combination if I could get all shrimp tempura as I don't care that much for most of the vegetable except for the broccoli but love shrimp tempura. So I asked the waiter if I could get that box with all shrimp tempura, even for an additional price and he said \"sure, no problem\" He then took everyone else's orders as they were ready to order. I felt reassured that I would get my meal the way I wanted it and waited patiently in anticipation for my food. \n\nWhen the waiter finally arrived with the food, I saw him putting what looked like my box down at someone else's seat but saw it had mixed tempura and thought maybe they ordered the same thing as me without all shrimp. then he put her box down in front of me which was all wrong as items on both plates were in the wrong box and my all shrimp tempura missing entirely. We point out the items that were wrongly placed in each box and the waiter says \"let me fix that for you\" and rearranges the two boxes and I point out that I ordered all shrimp tempura with my box as it was the first thing ordered and he just kept saying \"let me fix that for you\" so I assumed that he was going to bring me my shrimp tempura, but just goes off attending to his other tables as I begin to eat my meal. It becomes evident to me after a while that he is not bringing any shrimp and kept passing our table without checking in to ask if we needed anything. \n\nI finally flagged down another waitress and explained that I had ordered all shrimp tempura with my meal and that our waiter never brought me my shrimp. She tells me that shell bring me more shrimp tempura when it didn't matter anymore. I was just about done with everything else on my plate. twenty minutes after I finished the rest of my food, she brings me \"two\" shrimp tempuras and I had to save a bit of my Sapporo for a good ten minutes to wash it down and not have to order another one. the original box comes with a plate of tempura with only \"one\" shrimp tempura and about six vegetable. I was expecting five to seven shrimp but of course my whole order was messed up. \n\nAside from all of that, my teriyaki chicken wasn't very good either. the chicken tasted somewhat rubbery and I bit into two unidentifiable hard pieces that I had to spit out into a napkin and there was almost no teriyaki sauce either! just minimal on the chicken, but I have ordered teriyaki dishes many times at the previous Fuji and I was always able to mix the white rice and soak up the sauce with my rice; I have even ordered extra rice before and this time I couldn't soak up any sauce with my rice at all. We ordered a plate full of California rolls  with real crab meat to be shared and they were just okay. the miso and salad were good but that hardly redeems the mostly mediocre food and bad service.\n\nWhat pisses me off is that when you go out to eat, you go out to enjoy yourself and when a waiter or whoever brings you the wrong thing, all you can think about is how they screwed up your order and you can't enjoy your meal. the first waiter should have went straight to the kitchen and explained his own mistake, the chefs mistake or any other confusion and prioritized fixing my order, but the first waiter did nothing but mislead me into thinking he would fix my order ASAP but literally did nothing to make things right. \n\nIf it were up to me I would never go back to Fuji and find a better Japanese restaurant in the area or in San Francisco! there has to be plenty of them that are much better in San Francisco of all places, but I'm never the one to choose where we go out and eat.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-03-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Tried this place after a morning run and ordered the sashimi salad for lunch, really refreshing and light, just perfect...

Review #200 for Fuji.\n\nI really like little japanese restaurants like this. One of those places that sits in a sleepy little strip;  you might not notice it unless you were walking right by. But when you do venture through the door, you're surprised to find most seats filled with people happily eating their nigiri and slurping away at the udon. It's popular enough that they have their regulars who sit at the sushi bar on any given night talking to the sushi chefs. The place is very welcoming and spacious. The service was really friendly and attentive, they checked on us consistently and cleared the dishes right away. \n\nThe menu offers a varied selection, while the fresh fish of the day are posted on the wall. They have a lot of different rolls, but one that caught my eye was the Banana Split. I love my bananas and all, but in a sushi roll? \n\n- I tried the chirashi don, a selection of sashimi spread on a bed of sushi rice. The fish was nice and fresh, and the portions were ample. Not exactly the most adventurous, however, with salmon, yellowtail, tuna, octopus, egg, and mackeral making up the sashimi. There was also a nice, large spotted prawn joining the mix, which made for a nice presentation. The sushi rice was also well cooked. \n- Also tried the crunchy roll, which was spicy tuna covered in tempura crumbs and eel sauce with some more tuna on top. The eel sauce really masks the flavor of anything else in this roll, so we couldn't really taste much of the tuna or spicy tuna. \n- Tempura udon - The broth was fairly light and the noodles were not too chewy. Tempura was ok, as the shrimp tempura seemed a little overcooked and the tempura batter was somewhat dense. They give a pretty good amount of it, though. The udon also has cooked carrots in it. I've heard that's a Korean influence, but I'm not sure. \n\nPricewise, I'd say it's slightly above what you would expect to pay at a casual sushi restaurant. $21 for the chirashi don, $4-5 for standard nigiri, $10-15 for big rolls, $14 for tempura udon (that's pricey).

Unlike some other restaurants that serve distasteful burned chicken drenched in teriyaki sauce, Fuji's is light and not overpowering.\n\nIt is run by koreans, but who cares, cause the food is good. Its hard to find a decent, consistent Japanese restaurant anyway. Fuji is my go to place for Japanese. Yes, it may be a bit pricy but hey, it is the west portal area, rent is high. For those of you who have had a bad day here, I urge you to try it again. To the new folks, when you get a chance, come out here and try it.

I have frequented this restaurant since it first opened years ago, almost weekly for lunch. Unfortunately, the chef that used to run the place left a few months ago, and an unfortunate but subsequent downgrading of their food has happened.\n\nIt may be that I am a very picky person, or it may be that Fuji used to be an excellent, excellent place which raised my standards, but there was a period of time when their nigiri did not taste fresh, which is very distasteful to me, especially when it comes to raw fish. I could not finish my meal, and I almost decided to never go back. Only its lasting legacy from the past brought me back again.\n\nLuckily, I have recently been there for dinner many times and their chirashi sushi (sashimi sushi served arranged over sushi rice) has not been problematic at all. So it appears that whatever issue it was with their raw fish has been resolved.\n\nI also really like their salad dressing, which is not the cream kind that is often served in sushi restaurants, but rather a light, house-made vinegarette. \n\nService has always been superb, and, while dinner can be expensive, the restaurant's lunch specials are very affordable, and quite moderately priced. The place is also well-kept and neat.\n\nMy only current complaint is that Fuji used to serve the best beef teriyaki in town. It was not over-cooked, or too tough. Since the change of chefs, I have been hard-pressed to find something comparable. \n\nAlthough Fuji has lost its flare that made it exceptional for me, I would still go there just because it is still an average to good sushi restaurant with good service and tasteful food in general.

Earlier tonight, my wife and I waited just a few minutes for perfect seats at the center of the sushi bar, right in front of the head sushi chef.  For a Friday night, the place was understandably busy.  We could see most of the other food going to other customers were a variety of maki rolls and other entrees.  Our interest was pure and simple:  nigiri, and lots of it!\n\nThe meal was surprisingly sublime.  The fish was cool, tender, fresh, and properly seasoned as appropriate, while the rice was perfectly room temperature, with the right balance of chewiness, smoothness, and subtle vinegar flavor.  We believe we were at an advantage with our close proximity to the head sushi chef.  The time from him making the nigiri to it entering our mouths could literally be measured in seconds.\n\nOur favorites were the anago, the bonito, and the escolar, all bursting with flavor and wonderful mouth feel.  They were so good, we doubled up on those orders.  \n\nAlso good were the hotate, the kampachi, and the toro.  Less impressive, but still good, was the saba.  The hamachi sashimi was very nice.  The sunomono was good as well - I enjoyed the fresh piece of taco (octopus) from it.\n\nThe chef did comp us a special piece of toro with a nori wrap, no rice, and some sort of light color salty sauce.  That was quite nice of him.\n\nFor comparison, my wife and I commented to each other that this nigiri meal easily beat recent similar meals at Kabuto and Nagano on Geary St., and Higuma in Redwood City.  While not cheap, it was well worth the cost.\n\nPerhaps our experience would not have been as good if we had not sat at the sushi bar, nor focused on nigiri, but since we thoroughly enjoyed this one meal, and I've had good experiences before at Fuji, I'm assigning a 5 star rating.

Earlier tonight, my wife and I waited just a few minutes for perfect seats at the center of the sushi bar, right in front of the head sushi chef.  For a Friday night, the place was understandably busy.  We could see most of the other food going to other customers were a variety of maki rolls and other entrees.  Our interest was pure and simple:  nigiri, and lots of it!\n\nThe meal was surprisingly sublime.  The fish was cool, tender, fresh, and properly seasoned as appropriate, while the rice was perfectly room temperature, with the right balance of chewiness, smoothness, and subtle vinegar flavor.  We believe we were at an advantage with our close proximity to the head sushi chef.  The time from him making the nigiri to it entering our mouths could literally be measured in seconds.\n\nOur favorites were the anago, the bonito, and the escolar, all bursting with flavor and wonderful mouth feel.  They were so good, we doubled up on those orders.  \n\nAlso good were the hotate, the kampachi, and the toro.  Less impressive, but still good, was the saba.  The hamachi sashimi was very nice.  The sunomono was good as well - I enjoyed the fresh piece of taco (octopus) from it.\n\nThe chef did comp us a special piece of toro with a nori wrap, no rice, and some sort of light color salty sauce.  That was quite nice of him.\n\nFor comparison, my wife and I commented to each other that this nigiri meal easily beat recent similar meals at Kabuto and Nagano on Geary St., and Higuma in Redwood City.  While not cheap, it was well worth the cost.\n\nPerhaps our experience would not have been as good if we had not sat at the sushi bar, nor focused on nigiri, but since we thoroughly enjoyed this one meal, and I've had good experiences before at Fuji, I'm assigning a 5 star rating.

Review #200 for Fuji.\n\nI really like little japanese restaurants like this. One of those places that sits in a sleepy little strip;  you might not notice it unless you were walking right by. But when you do venture through the door, you're surprised to find most seats filled with people happily eating their nigiri and slurping away at the udon. It's popular enough that they have their regulars who sit at the sushi bar on any given night talking to the sushi chefs. The place is very welcoming and spacious. The service was really friendly and attentive, they checked on us consistently and cleared the dishes right away. \n\nThe menu offers a varied selection, while the fresh fish of the day are posted on the wall. They have a lot of different rolls, but one that caught my eye was the Banana Split. I love my bananas and all, but in a sushi roll? \n\n- I tried the chirashi don, a selection of sashimi spread on a bed of sushi rice. The fish was nice and fresh, and the portions were ample.

There was also a nice, large spotted prawn joining the mix, which made for a nice presentation. The sushi rice was also well cooked. \n- Also tried the crunchy roll, which was spicy tuna covered in tempura crumbs and eel sauce with some more tuna on top. The eel sauce really masks the flavor of anything else in this roll, so we couldn't really taste much of the tuna or spicy tuna. \n- Tempura udon - The broth was fairly light and the noodles were not too chewy. Tempura was ok, as the shrimp tempura seemed a little overcooked and the tempura batter was somewhat dense. They give a pretty good amount of it, though. The udon also has cooked carrots in it. I've heard that's a Korean influence, but I'm not sure. \n\nPricewise, I'd say it's slightly above what you would expect to pay at a casual sushi restaurant. $21 for the chirashi don, $4-5 for standard nigiri, $10-15 for big rolls, $14 for tempura udon (that's pricey).

So it appears that whatever issue it was with their raw fish has been resolved.\n\nI also really like their salad dressing, which is not the cream kind that is often served in sushi restaurants, but rather a light, house-made vinegarette. \n\nService has always been superb, and, while dinner can be expensive, the restaurant's lunch specials are very affordable, and quite moderately priced. The place is also well-kept and neat.\n\nMy only current complaint is that Fuji used to serve the best beef teriyaki in town. It was not over-cooked, or too tough. Since the change of chefs, I have been hard-pressed to find something comparable. \n\nAlthough Fuji has lost its flare that made it exceptional for me, I would still go there just because it is still an average to good sushi restaurant with good service and tasteful food in general.

It isn't very visually appealing and can be easily missed on the corner, but once you're in it's actually pretty cozy like you're at a local cafe.\n\nOn a weekend this place was just the right amount of crowded, meaning that my sister, mom and I didn't have to wait long for a table even though there were a few parties ahead of us and people leaving the restaurant. Now onto the food; the prices overall are a little steep, but in the end it was pretty worth it for the amount of food you get. My sister got the tempura donburi, I got the dinner bento box two and my mom got the bento box three.

I don't know if I would order both dinner items and sushi rolls if they don't come out at the same time.\n\nAnyways, I LOVED my bento box two; came with salmon teriyaki, a decent portion of tuna and salmon sashimi (these were FAT pieces and probably one of the places I can recommend for very fresh fish), shrimp and veggie tempura, and this side of spinach with ponzu sauce. The bento box three my mom got had two skewers of yakitori, an eggplant side, veggie tempura and california roll. Both boxes were about $17-$19 which isn't too bad for what you're getting.\n\nDownside of my experience: they weren't on top of refilling our waters or asking if everything was okay. I would definitely come back for the sashimi , but maybe to-go this time.
