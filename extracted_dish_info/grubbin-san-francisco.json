Then, it tasted just as it looked...good, but not spectacular. As far as the meat, I mostly tasted the ham, which is my least favorite of all the meat in the Grubbin' It. I barely tasted the bacon, which was the reason I chose to order it over the Droolin' (but it was in there, I checked). I hardly tasted the pastrami and cheddar cheese in the sandwich. The Dutch crunch bread was a little off as well. I wouldn't say it was stale, but it really did not have that delicious, sweet taste that fresh Dutch crunch usually has. The grub sauce was dripping out of the sandwich, making it very soggy and messy to eat. Overall, it was still a good sandwich, it just wasn't mind-blowing. People hyped it up too much. \n\nWhat I did like about my experience...it's a cute, little shop with great concept, name, and logo.

The Dutch crunch bread was a little off as well. I wouldn't say it was stale, but it really did not have that delicious, sweet taste that fresh Dutch crunch usually has.

I'm definitely coming back here. \n\nI went by there tonight, and while they are still putting on the final touches for the lighting and dining area, I was able to order up one of their \"juicin' sandwiches. Translation: juicin = turkey, avocado, bacon & fresh onions with their pesto aioli on a roll of your choice.   Given my previous experiences with rather mediocre sandwich places on this side of town, my expectations were somewhat low going in..  But the sandwich here was clearly several levels above any typical chain sandwich shop, and better than any usual mom & pop type of place.\n\nFresh ingredients. No skimping on the meat, shredded lettuce, Toasted Dutch crunch bread, and a complimentary soft drink or free bottled water too. $8.60 out the door for a 9\" long big TASTY sandwich. \n\nFriendly service too!\n\nYep..

"], "author": "Julie N.", "review": "so delicious!!\n\nit was my first time trying this place yesterday. I'm such a sandwich snob too, but it definitely exceeded my expectations! I had the \"droolin\" on wheat (no cheese). The wheat bread was surprisingly delightful. I normally would choose Dutch crunch (who wouldn't?!), but they were sold out of every other bread--again, another reflection of sandwich success. Anyways, back to the wheat--it was mildly sweet and flavorful. Not too much bread either (you know, when it overpowers the rest of the ingredients). The sauce was key! Typically, my favorite pastrami sandwich is from Subcenter--but the one downside is that, that sandwich is too \"drippy\" and messy. But this one isn't, it's a very \"neat\" sandwich, if that makes sense. Very filling as well, I was able to save the other half for a late night snack. \n\nOh, and I had some tater tots too--such a great idea! Reminds me of my middle school days. \n\nCan't wait to try the other sandwiches.

It's nice to finally have a bomb ass sandwich place by my house. I've tried a few things from here:\n\nJuicin' - turkey, bacon, avocado. OMG the best turkey sandwich I have ever had. Normally I hate getting turkey sandwiches cause they're just so..basic..like ham and you could make it yourself. But this place is the ONLY place I would ever pay for a turkey sandwich. Insanely delicious, super flavorful. I can't even describe. Perfect sandwich. \n\nDroolin - pastrami and salami. I was excited about this one but it's not as good as it sounds. Somehow there's just a weird flavor and it doesn't work well. (Other places do the same but it works) wouldn't get this sandwich again. \n\nCheesy tater tots - with ranch and bacon. Pretty good but it can be a little salty when you get the bacon. \n\nGarlic fries - pretty expensive for very little. Just the basic garlic fries... I wouldn't recommend it cause it doesn't come with much. \n\nOverall, just get the Juicin on Dutch crunch and you won't regret it. As much as I love this place.. I hope it doesn't get TOO popular cause I don't want to have to wait in line....", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-07-13"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Juicin' sandwich with tater tots and will be going back for more."], "author": "Pablo G.", "review": "Amazing little hole in the wall that produces incredibly fresh, delicious sandwiches.
