I immediately thought of Freshroll, mostly because I had it in my mind to have Vietnamese food.\n\nWhen we walked in, it was evident that this was probably going to be closer to a fusion experience rather than an authentic one.  Not really a big deal to me, think of what goes through your mind when you walk into a Chipotle for the first time after thinking you want an authentic burrito.  Speaking of Chipotle, the ordering system works very similar to that.  My process went as follows:\n\n1) Pick your Style: Vermicelli noodle bowl\n2) Pick your Protein: Lemongrass pork\n3) Pick your Veggies: Bean sprouts, cucumbers, scallions\n4) Pick your Sauces: Vietnamese Vinaigrette (aka nuoc cham)\n\nIt was all placed very nicely into the bowl and my friend got a Vietnamese Iced Coffee along with her Pork noodle bowl.  I love nuoc cham, especially full-flavored and less diluted by water nuoc cham.  Freshroll's version (and then calling it vinaigrette...really?) was mediocre and was watery with not too much flavor in the bottle.  What I did like about the bowl was the pork.  It had a really good flavor to it and they gave me a very generous serving. The veggies were also good, and at the end of the meal, I really thought that while it pales in comparison to somewhere like Bun Mee, for being around Westfield and City Target, this was a solid lunch spot.

By coincidence, I tried the nearby Bamboo Asia the other week, and that takes the same concept but goes for a contrived triple play by covering India, Japan, and Thailand. Freshroll wisely doesn't attempt a far-flung tour of the Far East. Instead, they focus strictly on Vietnam and consequently doesn't suffer from the Jack-in-the-Box syndrome of spreading itself too thin across a continent.\n\nI've been twice now - the first time by chance on their opening day, the second a couple of weeks later to see if some of the preparation jitters by the neophyte staff were ironed out. I think it's decent fare, nothing all that extraordinary and nothing that offensive, right in the middle. It's pretty easy to grasp what they're doing here once you study the menu once. You choose one of seven fillings and/or toppings (interestingly, none of them beef) - two variations on grilled chicken, another two using pork, one combo pork and chicken, one shrimp only, and one veggie option with tofu.\n\nThen you decide the vessel upon which you want them to place your ingredients - a roll trio, a super-roll, a vermicelli noodle bowl, a rice bowl, or a lettuce bowl.

Gone are the simple days of \"Choose your type, choose your protein, choose your toppings..\" Now every permutation of items has a different cost.  Shrimp costs $2 extra, Steak costs $1 extra, Fried scallions is $1 extra, avocado $1 extra, etc.  \n\nAnd, if you go over 3 toppings on the sandwich, they charge $0.50 per topping!!  You get 5 toppings on the salad, but the 6th will cost another $0.50 each.  Of course, $0.50 isn't enough for avocado, so that's an extra $1.00.

I ordered a side of taro chips for my two entrees (for a friend and me), and then I asked for sauces.  They said I could only get two pre-packaged sauces.  I remember being annoyed by that during my last visit, but I assumed at least it was 2 sauces per entree - no, two sauces per order, and no extra sauces for ordering the taro chips, which are presumably designed to dip in the sauces.  \n\nOf course, when I went to pour my own sauce, they were out of my favorite, the Orange Ginger sauce.  When I asked for more, I got a frustrated, \"I told you, only two sauces\" look.  After he realized they had run out of self-service sauce, he begrudgingly got me two more sauces.\n\nRather the sauces to me, he tried to cram them into the salad bowl.  This is pretty disgusting, especially given the slovenly appearance of the clerk, but also that he had been handling money without gloves - the same hands that carried the bowl and shoved it deep into my salad.  \n\nBetween the nickel-and-diming and the poor service, I was already pretty disappointed.
