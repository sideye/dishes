Hey, at least I tried. \n\nOK, Back to Basics...\n\nFounded in 1918, St. Francis Fountain operated as a candy store and ice cream parlor. 10 years ago, the current owners installed a kitchen turning St. Francis Fountain into a greasy spoon diner while keep the nostalgia of the early 1900s ice cream parlor with swirly retro stools. Serving breakfast ALL day, St. Francis Fountain has an extensive all-American breakfast menu with weekend specials (5 eggs benedict variations), a nice vegan selection, and $4 mimosas! They also have soups, salads, sandwiches and burgers on the menu. Don't forget to stop by their candy counter to revive the fat kid in you (mines never left) with Pop Rocks, Necco Wafers, Ring Pops and Sugar Daddys. \n\nSince Mr. NSS loves breakfast food, I thought St. Francis Fountain would be a great place to bring him. Do expect a wait on the weekends. On a Sunday afternoon at 2:30 PM, there was still a 10-15 minute wait. On the bright side, parking is much easier in this part of The Mission and Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream is just several blocks away.\n\nWhile enjoying the 80s and 90s throwbacks playing in the background, Mr. NSS had the Chef's Mess ($10) which was an artery-clogging behemoth of a thing in a bowl. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zx_VDLeaFdnMFkGyorDZtQ?select=8-4ip_RG5nlesdN-19dNog#8-4ip_RG5nlesdN-19dNog Crispy homefries with scrambled eggs, bacon, and mushrooms topped with melted cheese, tomatoes & sour cream. If that wasn't enough, he added avocado (+$1.50) and KILLED the entire thing.

This is very much a hipster place so make sure to come with your skinny jeans, fedora, and black-rimmed glasses. \n\nAfter several FAILED attempts of trying to \"refine\" Mr. NSS, I've come to terms that guys like and appreciate simplicity.

Great tip! It was everything a great breakfast should be: starchy, spicy, sweet and savory. The potatoes were cooked so that one side was a little well done crunchy (but not burnt). I thought that really elevated the dish. Even the guac had a good flavor; not sure if it is housemade, but it sure tasted like it was. The chorizo was mighty spicy and set my mouth on fire... I loved every second of it. It hurt so good! \n\nI tried a bite of Rosie's sandwich... that seitan is phenomenal!

Here's the thing - we were more than willing to build the burrito on its own, but $25 fucking dollars for one? It was a dick move for the server to charge it all separately, especially since each item wasn't in full on the side and was mixed ultimately for the burrito. Of course, we don't realize this until my credit card is charged, and I had to get back to work.\n\nDear server at St. Francis: if you're seeing that someone's BURRITO is totaling $25, don't be an ass and bring it to their attention.

It's not like it is hard to beat out Denny's but it is hard to find a place that will make breakfast at night, right. \n\nThe place looks much like the way it was opened back in the twenties. All of the booths and counters have to be at least 30-40 years old which gives it character, but with character comes the aging lines of time. It was easy to recognize where to sit in the booth because the butt prints of diners' past marked the landing zone with cracks and holes in the leather. The booths stand up straight like wooden castles that surround your party. \n\nThe food feels like they throw the kitchen sink at you. We had the french toast delight and the chef's mess. The french toast was anything but french and instead resembled the desert mountains of the west right after the first snow storm of the year. The toast was deep in the mountain floor under piles of strawberries, pineapples, nut, apples, raisins and sugar powdered granola. Ribbons of yogurt lined the lodes of french toast.

The contrast between the different textures and flavors, made the whole dish enjoyable with little nuggets of delight in every bite.\n\nThe chef's mess was what it claimed to be with eggs, cheese, sour cream, green onions and of course the most important ingredient... bacon. With these ingredients, its like shooting fish in a barrel when it comes to making something tasty. Rather than make your stomach feel like it hits your knees the mess was lighter and energizing.\n\nThe food was hearty but not overbearing. It seemed that the waiters were not eating it though because they were both morbidly skinny. I am coming back next time I feel like pancakes late, yet I don't want to feel like a bloated whale afterward.

This was the closest one that popped up.

Oh...my god folks...they add sour cream, cheese, chives and their homemade salsa that tastes like it came from a legit Mexican place. Best potatoes I've ever had. The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. While I've had bigger biscuits, these were unbelievably buttery and deliscious, and the gravy was bomb. The guitarist in the band had the exact same breakfast I did and was equally blown away which is a feat considering his food snobbery. Our keyboardist had this awesome breakfast burrito and a coffee shake which was also amazing. \n\nThe Verdict: \nGuys, this was hands down the best plate of biscuits and gravy I've ever had, and I always judge breakfast places by their pancakes or biscuits (usually both).

"], "author": "Natalye R.", "review": "St. Francis Fountain is one of those places I've been meaning to go to for the longest time, but for whatever reason, just haven't. \n\nThis past week, that finally changed. After striking out at Golden Era (closed on a Tuesday?!) and Weird Fish (closed for a private party?!), we decided on St. Francis. Since it was a week night, there were a ton of empty tables, which was a nice welcome compared to the last time I tried to eat there (a weekend morning) when we were told our wait would be an hour or two. \n\nWhen we walked in we were told to sit wherever we pleased. So we sat at a nice table in the back. \"Oh wait, not that one, in case a party of more than four comes in\" is what we were told. Oh, okay. So we moved to another table. No big deal, although no larger party did come in during our time there (about an hour before closing).\n\nI get the menu and I'm stoked to see all the vegan options. A bit later our drink orders are taken. A friend gets a Diet Coke. Another gets a Vanilla Coke. I hold off because I'm eyeing the soy milkshakes.\n\nServer comes a bit later. A friend orders first. She wants one of the Things (not certain if she orders the Vegan one or the Nebulous Potato one). Only catch, she wants black beans instead of homefries. We are told that the chef will refuse to make it this way, because the homefries are important for the \"structural integrity\" of the dish. OK fine. So she orders something else.\n\nI am torn between a few items, so I decide to ask some questions. \n\nSince the Chorizo and Eggs is calling out my name, I think that maybe I'll get that with tofu instead of eggs, even though that substitution costs an extra dollar or two. So I ask if they have vegan sour cream. The answer of which is no. \n\nThis is surprising to me, because they have vegan cheese and vegan other things. Additionally, anyone who KNOWS breakfast knows that sour cream is an important component in the \"structural integrity\" of potatoes. So why they cater to the vegan crowd on almost everything else but sour cream is baffling, but again, fine.\n\nInstead, I decide to get the Vegan Thing. I really want black beans instead of homefries, but I'd rather have vegan cheese than no sour cream. I need some kind of fake dairy to satiate my hunger.\n\nAlongside this, I order that shake I've been lusting after since the second we walked in.\n\nMoments later, our server returns to inform me that they're out of soy for the shakes. Insert sad face here. Instead, I decide to get a vanilla coke as well, since I've just tasted my companion's and it's quite good. Server goes to get it and returns shortly, saying they just ran out of vanilla coke - in fact, my friend got the last one. Which is annoying because not only are they out of it, but I'd also assumed that a diner like SFF would make their own - you know, regular coke with vanilla infusion. I mean, even Denny's does this on their own. But oh well, I settle for a diet vanilla coke, which is just fine in my book.\n\nSo we're sitting and chatting and waiting for our food when our server returns again to inform me that the chef has just begun making my meal and realizes that they're out of vegan cheese. Uh what?\n\nBegrudgingly, I settle on the Vegan Chorizo Hash & Tofu instead. Which is twice-removed from the meal I really wanted, but whatever, I'm starving.\n\nA minute or two passes and he comes out with my friends' meals. Mine doesn't come out for another 10 or so. So by the time they've finished their meals, I'm less than halfway through. As their plates are being cleared, I just ask for a to-go box, because we have some place we need to get to, and my food just isn't that good anyway.\n\nThe check comes, and my coke is comped. That's all. While I'm not expecting handouts, and I don't blame anyone for my subpar dining experience, it was still super disappointing that my entire time there felt more like a hassle than a pleasure. And while any singular instance of what happened wouldn't have bothered me, the fact that so many things went wrong, one after another, was discouraging.\n\nI don't know - call me a cynic, or an asshole, but if a menu boasts having lots of vegan options, I'd think that actually having those vegan ingredients on hand would be important to the \"structural integrity\" of its claim.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Because the Vegan Thing was SO GOOD.

Well, I had the \"Veggie Mess\" and it had soooo much cheese on it plus a pile of sour cream, I wasn't quite expecting that.

I get it if they are short staffed but that didn't seem to be the case.  Either way, the wait was only about 10 minutes but it just seemed odd.\n\nReason #3.  I get that its a place that employ's the hipsters... goes with the whole Mission Schtick... but I have a problem when dudes that are serving food are wearing tank tops.

Great tip! It was everything a great breakfast should be: starchy, spicy, sweet and savory. The potatoes were cooked so that one side was a little well done crunchy (but not burnt). I thought that really elevated the dish. Even the guac had a good flavor; not sure if it is housemade, but it sure tasted like it was. The chorizo was mighty spicy and set my mouth on fire... I loved every second of it. It hurt so good! \n\nI tried a bite of Rosie's sandwich... that seitan is phenomenal! It almost had a roast beef, pastrami-esque texture and flavor, without being as overpoweringly salty as its meaty counterpart. I've never seen seitan sliced so thin. I would love to order this on my next visit, as it comes with a heaping side of fries if you so choose. It looks fantastic, especially when you choose to add grilled onions and avocado on top. \n\nWe each must have had at least 2-3 cups of coffee, as they were quick to come by with a fresh pot to give us a warm-up. I really appreciated that! The staff is excellent, very attentive and well-mannered, especially for a Sunday morning (when I know my demeanor can be a little bit cranky).

Do expect a wait on the weekends. On a Sunday afternoon at 2:30 PM, there was still a 10-15 minute wait. On the bright side, parking is much easier in this part of The Mission and Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream is just several blocks away.\n\nWhile enjoying the 80s and 90s throwbacks playing in the background, Mr. NSS had the Chef's Mess ($10) which was an artery-clogging behemoth of a thing in a bowl. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zx_VDLeaFdnMFkGyorDZtQ?select=8-4ip_RG5nlesdN-19dNog#8-4ip_RG5nlesdN-19dNog Crispy homefries with scrambled eggs, bacon, and mushrooms topped with melted cheese, tomatoes & sour cream.

This is very much a hipster place so make sure to come with your skinny jeans, fedora, and black-rimmed glasses. \n\nAfter several FAILED attempts of trying to \"refine\" Mr. NSS, I've come to terms that guys like and appreciate simplicity.

Why don't you just go up to every customer, look them in the eye and say 'I could care less if you eat or not today because I'm a bitch.'\" Because that's kinda what it felt like. (2) I ordered coffee, because it's how I roll. I couldn't get anyone's attention to refill my coffee, and had about a cup and a half of it the entire time. Ask my friends...they will tell you that a cup and a half is not even near enough to satisfy me.

St. Francis Fountain just happened to be the pick of the day. And what a good choice it was...\n\nOld school 50's style dining brought to you by Mission Hipsters. I had read reviews that stated the servers here are aloof or dirty. I found the opposite to be true for the most part. Our coffee and water never got empty without being refilled.

Vegan Blueberry Pancakes were repeated back to us twice with \"Buttermilk Pancakes\". So once that confusion was solved our order came out extremely fast to the point were we thought it wasn't ours. So what did we get instead of Vegan Blueberry Pancakes? That's right, a Vegan Breakfast Burrito... Huh? It turned out to be a good thing since they asked if we would like to keep the burrito while they would whip up the correct pancake order. Free food? Score!\n\nThe Tofu Scramble with Ranchero was delicious even though it appeared to be undercooked and not very scrambled. Since I don't eat with my eyes I dove into the flavors of all the Ranchero sauce mixed with the tofu, mushrooms and green onions. One of the better tasting scrambles I've had in awhile. Coupled with a generous portion of tasty spuds along with a few slices of toast, this is a huge shareable dish.  \n\nThose Vegan Blueberry Pancakes that took some haggling to get weren't too bad. I like blueberries as much as anyone but I think they went a little buck wild with the blueberry scooper. The entire center was blueberries. They were good, not great. I would probably get one of the other Vegan options next time.\n\nThat free Vegan Breakfast Burrito plate was something I would consider ordering next visit. The black beans on the side had a bit of a chili kick to them. Very tasty. The filling was consisted mostly of a Vegan jack cheese.

"], "author": "Natalye R.", "review": "St. Francis Fountain is one of those places I've been meaning to go to for the longest time, but for whatever reason, just haven't. \n\nThis past week, that finally changed. After striking out at Golden Era (closed on a Tuesday?!) and Weird Fish (closed for a private party?!), we decided on St. Francis. Since it was a week night, there were a ton of empty tables, which was a nice welcome compared to the last time I tried to eat there (a weekend morning) when we were told our wait would be an hour or two. \n\nWhen we walked in we were told to sit wherever we pleased. So we sat at a nice table in the back. \"Oh wait, not that one, in case a party of more than four comes in\" is what we were told. Oh, okay. So we moved to another table. No big deal, although no larger party did come in during our time there (about an hour before closing).\n\nI get the menu and I'm stoked to see all the vegan options. A bit later our drink orders are taken. A friend gets a Diet Coke. Another gets a Vanilla Coke. I hold off because I'm eyeing the soy milkshakes.\n\nServer comes a bit later. A friend orders first. She wants one of the Things (not certain if she orders the Vegan one or the Nebulous Potato one). Only catch, she wants black beans instead of homefries. We are told that the chef will refuse to make it this way, because the homefries are important for the \"structural integrity\" of the dish. OK fine. So she orders something else.\n\nI am torn between a few items, so I decide to ask some questions. \n\nSince the Chorizo and Eggs is calling out my name, I think that maybe I'll get that with tofu instead of eggs, even though that substitution costs an extra dollar or two. So I ask if they have vegan sour cream. The answer of which is no. \n\nThis is surprising to me, because they have vegan cheese and vegan other things. Additionally, anyone who KNOWS breakfast knows that sour cream is an important component in the \"structural integrity\" of potatoes. So why they cater to the vegan crowd on almost everything else but sour cream is baffling, but again, fine.\n\nInstead, I decide to get the Vegan Thing. I really want black beans instead of homefries, but I'd rather have vegan cheese than no sour cream. I need some kind of fake dairy to satiate my hunger.\n\nAlongside this, I order that shake I've been lusting after since the second we walked in.\n\nMoments later, our server returns to inform me that they're out of soy for the shakes. Insert sad face here. Instead, I decide to get a vanilla coke as well, since I've just tasted my companion's and it's quite good. Server goes to get it and returns shortly, saying they just ran out of vanilla coke - in fact, my friend got the last one. Which is annoying because not only are they out of it, but I'd also assumed that a diner like SFF would make their own - you know, regular coke with vanilla infusion. I mean, even Denny's does this on their own. But oh well, I settle for a diet vanilla coke, which is just fine in my book.\n\nSo we're sitting and chatting and waiting for our food when our server returns again to inform me that the chef has just begun making my meal and realizes that they're out of vegan cheese. Uh what?\n\nBegrudgingly, I settle on the Vegan Chorizo Hash & Tofu instead. Which is twice-removed from the meal I really wanted, but whatever, I'm starving.\n\nA minute or two passes and he comes out with my friends' meals. Mine doesn't come out for another 10 or so. So by the time they've finished their meals, I'm less than halfway through. As their plates are being cleared, I just ask for a to-go box, because we have some place we need to get to, and my food just isn't that good anyway.\n\nThe check comes, and my coke is comped. That's all. While I'm not expecting handouts, and I don't blame anyone for my subpar dining experience, it was still super disappointing that my entire time there felt more like a hassle than a pleasure. And while any singular instance of what happened wouldn't have bothered me, the fact that so many things went wrong, one after another, was discouraging.\n\nI don't know - call me a cynic, or an asshole, but if a menu boasts having lots of vegan options, I'd think that actually having those vegan ingredients on hand would be important to the \"structural integrity\" of its claim.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Vegan sausage, Vegan chorizo hash, an omelet, ww toast,Chocolate malt, coffee and tea!\n\n"], "author": "Rinky N.", "review": "Success!

I have yet to try anything bad at this restaurant.  In order to be thorough they also have soups, salads and some vegetarian items on the menu that I have never tried.\n\nOn my most recent visit I ordered one of my menu favorites, the Chef's Mess (pictured).  This is an egg scrambler that combines their homefries, bacon pieces and sliced mushrooms.  Cheddar and jack cheese are melted on top of the scrambler then diced tomatoes, a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions finish the dish.  Your choice of toast comes with this selection.\n\nOn my second most recent visit I had the Hamburger with Bacon and Cheddar (also pictured).  All of their burgers are cooked medium well unless of course you ask otherwise, and these are thick, lean, beefy patties.  The menu states that they are 6 oz. patties.  The base burger comes with shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, a few thin strings of red onion and a couple of pickle chips.  The burger had a thick slice of cheddar melted on top of the patty along with two thick strips of crispy bacon that I had to crumble in half in order to make it fit.  The price is on the steeper side, but the burger is delicious.\n\nBurgers and sandwiches come with French Fries on the side.  I like how they are fried up crispy with the skin intact.  If you are not into the fried potatoes however, there are several other sides you can choose from including salad, soup, chili, mac and cheese or fruit.\n\nThey serve Mitchell's ice cream at St. Francis Fountain with about a dozen flavors.  I don't let my lactose intolerance bother me ever.  I carry Lactaid tablets with me at all times, and I enjoy ordering ice cream items.  My favorite flavor combination has always been vanilla ice cream with orange sherbet.  That's right the Dreamsicle combo.  Perhaps that is why I love the Dream Shake (pictured) so much.\n\nI sit at the counter most of the time because I enjoy watching the waitress make my shake with a light pour of whole milk, a shot of Torani vanilla syrup, orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream.  One of the waitresses with short dark hair makes a real kick ass milkshake.  Sorry but I always forget to ask her name.  She leaves the shake on the mixer for a super long time and the result is a shake so thick the long metal spoon will stand up in the middle of the glass for a good half hour after the shake has been made.  Don't ask why, but I tried it once (the spoon caper, that is).\n\nThe service is usually pretty good as the wait staff are really cool.\n\nAlthough I have a long time to go before I can exercise the ten percent senior discount here I'm hopeful that San Francisco's oldest ice cream parlor will still be here serving up a great menu and delicious ice cream treats.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["The dreamsicle soda was AMAZING as was the old-fashioned shake (", "yeah, i pigged out).

There is a line outside and everyone in the party must be present to be seated, luckily it isn't raining yet. \n\nWe are seated in a comfy booth and are drink orders are taken immediately. Just water for me. \n\nPerusing the menu, I give in and order the \"Nebulous Potato Thing\" ($6.75) which is basically home fries w/ sour cream, salsa, green onions, melted cheese. It takes about 15-20 mins for the food to come out. It looks smaller than it is because the plate it comes on is actually a wide bowl. There is plenty of food there. I slather on the ketchup, hot sauce and pepper until I have red hott mess in front of me. \n\nIt was so good and filling, I didn't eat till 10:00 that night, and that is after a hike in Marin. I will definitely come back for the Guinness float or some of the other breakfast dish.

I have yet to try anything bad at this restaurant.  In order to be thorough they also have soups, salads and some vegetarian items on the menu that I have never tried.\n\nOn my most recent visit I ordered one of my menu favorites, the Chef's Mess (pictured).  This is an egg scrambler that combines their homefries, bacon pieces and sliced mushrooms.  Cheddar and jack cheese are melted on top of the scrambler then diced tomatoes, a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions finish the dish.  Your choice of toast comes with this selection.\n\nOn my second most recent visit I had the Hamburger with Bacon and Cheddar (also pictured).  All of their burgers are cooked medium well unless of course you ask otherwise, and these are thick, lean, beefy patties.  The menu states that they are 6 oz. patties.  The base burger comes with shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, a few thin strings of red onion and a couple of pickle chips.  The burger had a thick slice of cheddar melted on top of the patty along with two thick strips of crispy bacon that I had to crumble in half in order to make it fit.  The price is on the steeper side, but the burger is delicious.\n\nBurgers and sandwiches come with French Fries on the side.  I like how they are fried up crispy with the skin intact.  If you are not into the fried potatoes however, there are several other sides you can choose from including salad, soup, chili, mac and cheese or fruit.\n\nThey serve Mitchell's ice cream at St. Francis Fountain with about a dozen flavors.  I don't let my lactose intolerance bother me ever.  I carry Lactaid tablets with me at all times, and I enjoy ordering ice cream items.  My favorite flavor combination has always been vanilla ice cream with orange sherbet.  That's right the Dreamsicle combo.  Perhaps that is why I love the Dream Shake (pictured) so much.\n\nI sit at the counter most of the time because I enjoy watching the waitress make my shake with a light pour of whole milk, a shot of Torani vanilla syrup, orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream.  One of the waitresses with short dark hair makes a real kick ass milkshake.  Sorry but I always forget to ask her name.  She leaves the shake on the mixer for a super long time and the result is a shake so thick the long metal spoon will stand up in the middle of the glass for a good half hour after the shake has been made.  Don't ask why, but I tried it once (the spoon caper, that is).\n\nThe service is usually pretty good as the wait staff are really cool.\n\nAlthough I have a long time to go before I can exercise the ten percent senior discount here I'm hopeful that San Francisco's oldest ice cream parlor will still be here serving up a great menu and delicious ice cream treats.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Awesome Dream Shake by the way (your \"old school\" straw will fall apart... as for a 2!).

From what I understand, this establishment was already old-school by the 1950's, and actually is closer to 100 years old!  \n\nIt doesn't take much more than that to get me excited about \"hip\" little diners like this; you already have a pretty clear idea of what is being served up at the St. Francis: Breakfast, Burgers, Coffee - Oh, and a selection of Mitchell's Ice Cream, so Milkshakes, Banana Splits and Hot Fudge Sundaes (if that's what you want for lunch!).  I went with the Turkey Bacon Club on Sliced Sourdough with Cheddar and a Caesar Salad...not one bit disappointed by my decision at all.  \n\nSurprisingly the parking is pretty easy here, considering that this part of San Francisco can be a little challenging at times (and many spaces limited to 1 hour only).  Just bring a handful of change ($2/hr...wow San Francisco!), and be ready to sidestep the panhandler with the shopping cart after you feed the meter.  Really, though, it actually is a pretty nice neighborhood!\n\nAlso be prepared to \"chat it up\" with the person sitting next to you if you come alone and sit at the counter: the place fills up quick, and the \"hip-girl\" with the Oversized sunglasses (which never came off) sitting next to me wanted some conversation in addition to me passing her the sugar for her soy-infused coffee.  \n\n\"What was I doing in the neighborhood?\" was the general tone of the conversation.  \n\nJust passing through...and I will be sure to do that here again sometime soon!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-11-08"}, {"excerpts": ["But the portions for lunch were small - and my side order of banana bread was ridiculously small given the price.

In fact, it's pretty good. I like it, and when it's not busy, I'll sneak in for a vegan peanut butter milkshake and I will REALLY ENJOY IT.\n\nDamn it. \n\nThe difference between this place and Boogaloo's is... They have good food. Duh. They have good VEGAN food, too. I mean, man -- their vegan milkshakes are awesomely delicious. And I've always had good service here. \n\nMy friend Sara and I boldly journeyed here for brunch in a torrential downpour when our office out on ends-of-the-earth-Marin-Headlands Beach was closed during the big storms at the beginning of January. We basically had the place to ourselves (only a torrential downpour and 60-mile-an-hour winds could keep the hipsters away; they're like the Wicked Witch of the West, you know; they melt in water!). And as pretty much the only customers, we had a great time with the servers. \n\nThey taught me a thing or two about my new (psychotic) CrackBerry (further evidence that hipsters are hypocrites themselves when it comes to technology; see my Boogaloo's review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/boogaloos-san-francisco#hrid:Z9uvuBpgNtfjQWRsq6YABQ).   They served us delicious vegan sammies and fries that left me NOT complaining about wanting REAL diner food.

But she can make you any kind of milkshake under the sun -- totally vegan, and you'd never know it. The flavors she concocts, back in her wood-paneled kitchen laboratory... Hot damn. That particular day, I tried banana walnut, at her suggestion. Oh yeah.\n\nSo my beef with St. Francis is, of course, that we really only get downpours torrential enough to keep the hipsters away about once every couple months. So I'm usually passing the Fountain by, groaning at all the skinny jeans lined up outside as I move on to the Sun Rise a few blocks up 24th.\n\nTherefore I can only give them three stars. And yes, I'm punishing them for their clientele. But just know that I really want to give them more, and be satisfied that I realize I'm a hypocrite. \n\nHipsters make the best vegan milkshakes.

The selection of fruit was quite sad, just raisins, apple and cantaloupe chunks, strawberries and grapes, which are some odd pairings with yogurt and toast?

My family is from NYC, but I grew up throughout the country. Wherever I lived I would seek out the best diner and call it my culinary home. In Boston, it was S&S in Inman Square. In NYC, it was too many to choose from (paradise!). In Santa Fe, it was the Plaza Cafe. \n\nSo, when I moved to San Francisco last year and discovered I lived a block away from a diner people raved about, I got nervous. \"What if it totally sucks? What if the place I like is miles away at the end of some trolley car, or whatever they drive here, line?\" \n\nTo be honest, my worries were not quelled when I saw the hipster crowds hanging outside. My experience is that the \"scene\" spots in life are not always the best eating. And why should they be? If a scene is what people want to pay for, give them the scene (and cut your expenses on those gourmet cheeses).  \n\nBy the time I had my first meal at St. Francis, a BLT and a cup of chicken soup, I was prepared for the worse.  But from the minute I stepped inside to my last slurp of chocolate milkshake, my fears were replaced by admiration for the quality, care and charm of this singular, homestyle, \"write home about\" worthy establishment. \nHere's why St. Francis excels, in particular: \n\n1. They have all the diner standards, but they use fresh ingredients and prepare the food with care. The flavors are clear, well balanced, and I find the dishes to be as rich, salty and cheesy as you want them to be, but they go easy on the grease. \n2. The staff is fresh, young and beautiful (ok, put up your hipster shields), but they are also sincere, kind and attentive (put your shields down). \n3. They don't rush you. If they are not busy you are free to leisurely finish your meandering conversation about the New Yorker article you and your friend both skimmed but have strong opinions about. \n4. Going alone feels great, even without a book. If you're a freelancer like me, this is a useful bonus. It's not Cheers where everyone comes rushing over and gives you a hug, but you will be looked in the eye, treated with respect and served amazing food. \n\nI wish I could recommend lots of menu items, but I'm now stuck in the most satisfying ordering rut, the veggie reuben with spinach salad and a chocolate milkshake.

I have yet to try anything bad at this restaurant.  In order to be thorough they also have soups, salads and some vegetarian items on the menu that I have never tried.\n\nOn my most recent visit I ordered one of my menu favorites, the Chef's Mess (pictured).  This is an egg scrambler that combines their homefries, bacon pieces and sliced mushrooms.  Cheddar and jack cheese are melted on top of the scrambler then diced tomatoes, a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions finish the dish.  Your choice of toast comes with this selection.\n\nOn my second most recent visit I had the Hamburger with Bacon and Cheddar (also pictured).  All of their burgers are cooked medium well unless of course you ask otherwise, and these are thick, lean, beefy patties.  The menu states that they are 6 oz. patties.  The base burger comes with shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, a few thin strings of red onion and a couple of pickle chips.  The burger had a thick slice of cheddar melted on top of the patty along with two thick strips of crispy bacon that I had to crumble in half in order to make it fit.  The price is on the steeper side, but the burger is delicious.\n\nBurgers and sandwiches come with French Fries on the side.  I like how they are fried up crispy with the skin intact.  If you are not into the fried potatoes however, there are several other sides you can choose from including salad, soup, chili, mac and cheese or fruit.\n\nThey serve Mitchell's ice cream at St. Francis Fountain with about a dozen flavors.  I don't let my lactose intolerance bother me ever.  I carry Lactaid tablets with me at all times, and I enjoy ordering ice cream items.  My favorite flavor combination has always been vanilla ice cream with orange sherbet.  That's right the Dreamsicle combo.  Perhaps that is why I love the Dream Shake (pictured) so much.\n\nI sit at the counter most of the time because I enjoy watching the waitress make my shake with a light pour of whole milk, a shot of Torani vanilla syrup, orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream.  One of the waitresses with short dark hair makes a real kick ass milkshake.  Sorry but I always forget to ask her name.  She leaves the shake on the mixer for a super long time and the result is a shake so thick the long metal spoon will stand up in the middle of the glass for a good half hour after the shake has been made.  Don't ask why, but I tried it once (the spoon caper, that is).\n\nThe service is usually pretty good as the wait staff are really cool.\n\nAlthough I have a long time to go before I can exercise the ten percent senior discount here I'm hopeful that San Francisco's oldest ice cream parlor will still be here serving up a great menu and delicious ice cream treats.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["I loved the fried egg sandwich with vegan sausage and the dreamsicle orange sherbet float that I got.

I had it on my list of places to visit in SF mainly because of the vegan shake and ice cream.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up having lunch here on our last day in town.  The guy next to us had ordered the Vegan Chorizo Hash with Tofu, and it looked sooooo good, we BOTH GOT IT.  \n\nIt was pretty amazing: in the center, a tofu scramble with ranchero sauce, and surrounding it, vegan chorizo mixed in with diced potatoes, with three soft, hot corn tortillas on the side! \n\nIt comes with a side: I got mine with a side of veggie chili--it wasn't as good as the Whole Foods canned variety, but was topped with scallions--and my boyfriend got a side of home fries, which were really good, nice and firm, and covered in herbs.\n\nHe got the \"Dream\" shake (orange sherbet and vanilla, topped with whipped cream and a cherry), and I got the vanilla \"All Soy\" shake.

They even have veganaise and Earth Balance Buttery Spread.\n\nI ordered the vegan blueberry pancakes with a side of vegan chorizo hash. The pancakes are more dense and chewy than your typical buttermilk variety. This is neither better nor worse, just different. They were bursting with blueberries, which was a treat. The vegan chorizo hash is quite oily (as hash often is), but it's quite tasty. They served it with the Earth Balance spread, which I had never tried before. It's pretty similar to a salted, whipped butter.\n\nMy partner ordered the Polar Melt on light rye. The seitan is well seasoned. If you like patty melts and the like, this is a great veggie option (it came with jack cheese, which you can probably leave off it you want to go vegan). It's one of the best melts I've tasted in a long time!\n\nThey carry Mitchell's ice cream and La Copa Loca gelato for desserts and fountain drinks. They also have vanilla soy as a non-dairy option. We didn't try any of these since we were so full from our meals. Maybe next time.\n\nTheir brewed coffee is pleasantly strong and their staff is quite friendly. Combined with a big, tasty meal, it's hard to leave without a smile on your face. It's not the healthiest place to eat (it is an old-school diner after all!), but the veggie and vegan options really show how almost every other restaurant out there is really dropping the ball when it comes to plant-based dining!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-03-14"}], "chocolate brownie": [], "homemade apple pie": [], "apple pie a la mode": [{"excerpts": ["the apple pie a la mode is pretty cathartic on a day where nothing is peachy.
