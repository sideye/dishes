Reasonably priced and good quality fish.\n\nBest thing about this place is the chill and relaxed vibe and the head chef/manager Ryo.  I've become a regular here and he definitely knows his fish and his technique is impeccable.  Sit at the bar, order from him and he'll take care of you.\n\nFor me a sign of a good chef is one that's constantly tasting his food, making sure that it's up to his standards of taste and quality.  I've had the pleasure of sitting in front of the sushi bar and watching Ryo break down the complicated structure of a flying fish, all the while tasting different cuts and making sure they were excellent. Over the next few weeks he refined his marinade and cure for his flying fish to the point that he really brought out its beautiful flavors without sacrificing the fish's great texture.\n\nIt's a common misconception that sushi is the freshest fish available when in fact most sushi is aged, marinated, or cured for a few days before serving.  There in lies some of the art to great sushi, and at Domo, Ryo knows how to treat the fish he gets.  I'm a sushi purist.  Give me your nigiri, give me your sashimi.  I don't really care for sushi rolls but I've had them and they don't disappoint either.  Before Domo I used to HATE mackerel.  At other sushi places, the fishiness of mackerel would be overpowering.  At Domo, Ryo prepares his mackerel carefully and in small batches and the outcome is a fresh fish taste and texture.  I love the mackerel at Domo, and I believe that he elevates all of the other fish he receives to a higher degree than most other sushi spots at the same price point.  Along those same lines, a sign of a really good chef is consistency. If I like a restaurant, I'll always return a few times, and when it comes to sushi I'll invariably have bad visits - times when I'll find a bone in my sushi or the fish won't be up to par.  This hasn't been the case at Domo.  I've been several times and it's always been wonderful.\n\nMy faves on the menu:\nFish Tacos - Love the tempura fried nori.  I always ask him to go light on the salsa.\n\nSea urchin crudo - He pairs his urchin with avocado, and it reinforces the butteryness of the urchin while mellowing out the oceany flavor.\n\nAnkimo (monk fish liver) crudo - a simple presentation and take on ankimo and it's really good.\n\nSake toro (salmon belly)\nSunazuri (hamachi belly)\nRyo has a great way of balancing out the fattyness of these cuts with something bright and refreshing be it a thin, thin slice of kumquat or some pickled ginger.\n\nAnd again, ask him for what he's got and what's \"fresh\" Ryo is great at showcasing some of his fresh batches and what's in season.  Some of my faves off-menu have been:\n\nFlying fish - great texture and mild flavor\nHalf Beak - a firmer, smoother texture than most fish but delicious\nWalu (butterfish) - cured well with an almost sweet/buttery flavor\nBlack Snapper\nRed Snapper\n\nCome to Domo, sit at the bar, order sushi, and enjoy - rinse, wash and repeat.

Still too much but oh so good.\n\nThe firecracker balls were my favorite, as I mentioned, but the domo roll was a close second. A california roll wrapped in cooked salmon and seared scallops topped with spicy mayo and a few other sauces. Oh good lord those scallops were good. I wish there had been more of them (it was more salmon heavy). Although delicious it was difficult to eat. I think the scallops made it a bit hard to roll so the pieces fell apart. Huge sushi pet peeve of mine but it was damn tasty I let it slide. SLIDE RIGHT INTO MY BELLY, THAT IS.\n\nThe service is quick but not overly friendly.

Forget that it has 15 seats and doesn't take reservations--it's charming with specials handwritten on a mirror and cozy with views of either tree-lined Laguna Street or the sushi chefs hard at work.  The menu is big enough for classics and creativity, yet small enough to not be visually overwhelming. \n\nMy boyfriend let me take the reigns with ordering and, of course, I went crazy.  We began with uni (sea urchin) and ankimo (monkfish liver) crudo (two for $6).  They were beautifully presented on soup spoons, and I couldn't help but compare them to the Spoonfuls of Happiness at Koo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/koo-san-francisco).  Although the crudo here was delicate in flavor and rich in texture, the Spoonfuls of Happiness there were a foodgasm in my mouth.  We also had the dynamite mussels (two for $6)--these were hot, juicy, and flavorful, though I'm still more crazy about the baked mussels at Sushi Zone (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-zone-san-francisco).  \n\nA sushi bar is only as good as its cuts of sashimi, so we had to have some of my favorites: hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon) (5 pieces each for $10).  The hamachi was incredible--so fresh and so thick.  The sake would've been as enjoyable if it weren't so thin.  Where Domo shines, however, is the rolls.  We had the fire cracker balls ($10), the spider roll ($9), and the spicy hulk ($10).  The fire cracker balls were a flavor explosion (no pun intended)--crunchy and saucy with kick.  It was my pick of the three.  The spider was as good as any great one that I've had.  The parties on either side of us ordered the spicy hulk, so we did as well; the spicy tuna in it was delicious, but the ponzu sauce overpowered it sometimes. \n\nAlthough I've had better versions of the same things elsewhere, my collective experience at Domo was still nothing short of five stars.  Even with seven items, beer, and sake, the total bill was only $83 before tax and tip.

The inside is just avocado and another veggie, while the kobe beef wraps around it like nori. NOT tasty. Not worth it. \n\nThe wait is 30 min - 1 hr on weekends at dinner time.

We began with uni (sea urchin) and ankimo (monkfish liver) crudo (two for $6).  They were beautifully presented on soup spoons, and I couldn't help but compare them to the Spoonfuls of Happiness at Koo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/koo-san-francisco).  Although the crudo here was delicate in flavor and rich in texture, the Spoonfuls of Happiness there were a foodgasm in my mouth.

The hamachi was incredible--so fresh and so thick.  The sake would've been as enjoyable if it weren't so thin.  Where Domo shines, however, is the rolls.  We had the fire cracker balls ($10), the spider roll ($9), and the spicy hulk ($10).  The fire cracker balls were a flavor explosion (no pun intended)--crunchy and saucy with kick.  It was my pick of the three.  The spider was as good as any great one that I've had.  The parties on either side of us ordered the spicy hulk, so we did as well; the spicy tuna in it was delicious, but the ponzu sauce overpowered it sometimes. \n\nAlthough I've had better versions of the same things elsewhere, my collective experience at Domo was still nothing short of five stars.  Even with seven items, beer, and sake, the total bill was only $83 before tax and tip.  Yes, it isn't cheap but it's reasonable--the bites were well worth the dollars.\n\nThis was the perfect cap to our Sunday afternoon walk through Hayes Valley.

One thing I always complain about is how San Francisco lacks good sushi.  I'm talking about delicious L.A.-style sushi.  You know, the trendy, fun sushi that you eat at Katsuya while people-watching.  For me, Domo served this purpose... except without the celebrities and celebutantes... \n\nIt was a Saturday night and we had made dinner reservations at a different place in Hayes Valley and were STARVING.  To our dismay, we learned out our table would not be ready for awhile since other diners were lagging, so we decided to walk around Hayes Valley.  I wasn't even craving sushi at the time, but saw Domo and instantly started to think about how delicious it could be.  We put our names on the list and - lucky us! - were able to get seats at the inside bar area within a few minutes!\n\nPlease note that I can't speak to the quality of the sashimi or nigiri because we were STARVING so we just shared rolls (more bang for our buck), but the rolls are outstanding if you are in the mood for that!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nFirecracker balls: 5/5 REaLLy tasty!  Don't expect to really taste the fish and to love the firecracker balls as sushi, but still expect to love them.  They're SO flavorful!  And deliciously spicy.  No wasabi or soy sauce needed.\n\nSpicy hulk:  5/5 One thing Domo does REALLY well is its spicy tuna!  Get as much of it as you can!  I usually don't like rolls wrapped in cucumber rather than rice, but the spicy hulk was SO good!  Again, perfectly spicy and tasty - no wasabi or soy sauce needed.\n\nCrunchy spicy tuna: 4.5/5 Also delicious, again because of the outstanding spicy tuna.  Would definitely get this again.\n\nJalapeno hamachi: 3/5 Decent.  We didn't love it, but it was still decent.  The chunks of jalapeno were a bit much, I thought.  My eyes started to water a bit.  I wouldn't get this roll again.\n\nFiesta: 1/5  Yuck.  I guess I don't like mango pieces in rolls.  It tasted a bit disturbing with the fish and I ended up pulling the mango pieces out in the end and dousing this roll with soy sauce and wasabi.  Definitely would not get this again.\n\nFish taco appetizer:  This dish gets probs for how creatively it is put together.  The taco \"shell\" is made of seaweed and tempura batter.  I am going to refrain from giving this a rating since I HATE salmon and didn't realize, in our ordering frenzy (don't judge me), that there was salmon in here.  My dinner companion liked this, though, and he's a salmon fan.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dinner at Domo.  We shared a bottle of unfiltered sake, which made for a fun evening:)  \n\nJust a tip:  I don't recommend coming here if you have more than 2 people because I think it's pretty hard to get a table.

Figured that (A) they have a lot of good reviews, and (B) their menu isn't insanely expensive like some places (i.e. Blue Fin). Both points are pretty spot on.\n\nBe warned, Domo is a sushi BAR, not a restaurant; there's enough seating for maybe 15-20 people at most, making it a pretty tight squeeze if you're looking to bring friends. The atmosphere is both modern and intimate, so it'd make a nice little dinner-date location if anything.

Because I did not have any more assignments to do, nor did I have to wake up this morning at the butt crack of dawn, I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically agreed to meet him in the city for dinner.

And then when I *finally* made it to Hayes Valley, there was no parking AND stupid-ass drivers kept blocking the roads.  To top it all off, I had drunk a gallon of coffee at work, and didn't pee before I left Napa.  This equaled a miserable Kerrie L.\n\nAfter I *finally* found parking, my friend, his friend, and I went into Domo...where a table for three was miraculously waiting for us.  (I made a bee-line for the bathroom, which was nice, by the way.)  So...apparently, we're all pretty loquacious, which meant we weren't in a big hurry to look at the menu.  We pretty much made our decisions while the server was there, taking a little more of their time than they had wanted, I'm sure.  So - their patience was a high point.\n\nWhen I finally got around to looking at the menu, my first thought was, \"JIVE ASS.\"  Firecracker Balls, Spicy Hulk, Sexy Mama???

Not the case at Domo, each roll works and it is a great place to experiment with new kinds of fish and flavor combinations that you might not have put together yourself. Don't miss the Spicy Hulk!

Because I did not have any more assignments to do, nor did I have to wake up this morning at the butt crack of dawn, I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically agreed to meet him in the city for dinner.  However, this involved getting to the city from Napa at rush hour - I kept hitting stupid traffic...bay bridge traffic started way back in El Cerrito...and then again at the Octavia St exit.  And then when I *finally* made it to Hayes Valley, there was no parking AND stupid-ass drivers kept blocking the roads.  To top it all off, I had drunk a gallon of coffee at work, and didn't pee before I left Napa.  This equaled a miserable Kerrie L.\n\nAfter I *finally* found parking, my friend, his friend, and I went into Domo...where a table for three was miraculously waiting for us.  (I made a bee-line for the bathroom, which was nice, by the way.)  So...apparently, we're all pretty loquacious, which meant we weren't in a big hurry to look at the menu.  We pretty much made our decisions while the server was there, taking a little more of their time than they had wanted, I'm sure.  So - their patience was a high point.\n\nWhen I finally got around to looking at the menu, my first thought was, \"JIVE ASS.\"  Firecracker Balls, Spicy Hulk, Sexy Mama???  What would Nobu think? :(  I told my companions that I could go for anything...anything except uni and monkfish liver.  Because...well...EW.\n\nBut as the night went on, and I drank more sake, I learned to accept the jive ass...even encouraging another order of the Fish Tacos.  Everything was fresh, flavors were strong, and of course, the presentation was very nice.  Finally, one of us dropped out and said he was done, but being the troopers we were, the \"bro\" and I decided to go for one last dish.  And because I was in such a great mood, I agreed to try an order of UNI and MONKFISH LIVER (you pick two items from the \"small crudos\" section of the menu).  I did it, I loved it, and now you can't say I'm not adventurous.\n\nSuch a perfect way to start my 2-MONTH vacation. :D", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-18"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorite roll we ordered was the Sexy Mama.

For me, Domo served this purpose... except without the celebrities and celebutantes... \n\nIt was a Saturday night and we had made dinner reservations at a different place in Hayes Valley and were STARVING.  To our dismay, we learned out our table would not be ready for awhile since other diners were lagging, so we decided to walk around Hayes Valley.

We put our names on the list and - lucky us! - were able to get seats at the inside bar area within a few minutes!\n\nPlease note that I can't speak to the quality of the sashimi or nigiri because we were STARVING so we just shared rolls (more bang for our buck), but the rolls are outstanding if you are in the mood for that!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nFirecracker balls: 5/5 REaLLy tasty!  Don't expect to really taste the fish and to love the firecracker balls as sushi, but still expect to love them.  They're SO flavorful!  And deliciously spicy.  No wasabi or soy sauce needed.\n\nSpicy hulk:  5/5 One thing Domo does REALLY well is its spicy tuna!  Get as much of it as you can!  I usually don't like rolls wrapped in cucumber rather than rice, but the spicy hulk was SO good!  Again, perfectly spicy and tasty - no wasabi or soy sauce needed.\n\nCrunchy spicy tuna: 4.5/5 Also delicious, again because of the outstanding spicy tuna.  Would definitely get this again.\n\nJalapeno hamachi: 3/5 Decent.  We didn't love it, but it was still decent.  The chunks of jalapeno were a bit much, I thought.  My eyes started to water a bit.  I wouldn't get this roll again.\n\nFiesta: 1/5  Yuck.  I guess I don't like mango pieces in rolls.  It tasted a bit disturbing with the fish and I ended up pulling the mango pieces out in the end and dousing this roll with soy sauce and wasabi.  Definitely would not get this again.\n\nFish taco appetizer:  This dish gets probs for how creatively it is put together.  The taco \"shell\" is made of seaweed and tempura batter.  I am going to refrain from giving this a rating since I HATE salmon and didn't realize, in our ordering frenzy (don't judge me), that there was salmon in here.  My dinner companion liked this, though, and he's a salmon fan.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dinner at Domo.  We shared a bottle of unfiltered sake, which made for a fun evening:)  \n\nJust a tip:  I don't recommend coming here if you have more than 2 people because I think it's pretty hard to get a table.

Absurdly good.\nCrispy spicy tuna (also not on the menu): holy crap.  $9.60 of intense flavor and great textures!  Comes on an extra long plate, and the pieces of the roll barely fit into my mouth.  It's super filling and very indulgent.  \nThe nigiri is always very good and fresh tasting.  I've tried to be more adventurous in my fish consumption - the Tazmanian Trout is a new favorite.\nThe Spicy Hulk roll is fun and tasty.  Using cucumber as a wrapper is inventive and I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate.\nThe Rock and Roll is a good standard unagi roll.\nThe Jalepeno Hamachi is another good combo - I really like the bright flavor of the pepper mixed with the fish.\nMy vegetarian friend has good things to say about the veggie stuff.  We both like the edamame.  \nThe service is brisk and efficient.

The fish is always fresh and sliced generously and the sushi rice is seasoned properly.  I've been going for about three years, and now that I live in the neighborhood, I go at least twice a month.  And, while I may go alone, I never eat alone.  Ryo, the head sushi chef and manager, is unpretentious, outgoing, cool, and has great taste in music.  It's easy to sit at the bar and engage him in conversation while he prepares you some delicious sushi.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful with the menu. \n\nI like to recommend Domo as a good date place, especially for dates #1-4.  It's small and intimate with soft lighting, so everyone looks pretty good and you don't have to yell to communicate.  The seating is all counter style so you sit next to one another which can work when you're too nervous or don't want to be forced to face each other, or, when you want to be able to lean in closer or even have a reason to \"accidentally\" touch.  Finally, it's sushi.  For those fortunate enough to be on a date with someone who likes sushi, it's perfect date food, light, yet filling, allows you to show off your cultured palate and the dinner can be as long or as short as you can handle.  And to help you seal the deal, you can try going off the beaten path from the menu and order dinner from Ryo, omakase (chef's choice).\n\nWhile they don't have a \"kitchen\", there are some excellent dishes besides sushi/sashimi that are unique to Domo.  Try any of their Crudos; the Ankimo, monkfish liver pate, is made in-house, fresh, and is great for those who enjoy foie gras or duck liver pate.  The Daikon Salad, served with arugula and bonito shavings; light and refreshing while anchored with the earthy bitterness of the arugula and the delicate saltiness of the bonito and drizzled with a house dressing.  Iidako, deep-fried baby octopus served with a spicy dipping sauce, takes the pedestrian calamari to a different level.  One of my go-to favorites, and highly overlooked, is the Hamachi Kama.  The kama is the jaw or cheek of the Yellowfin Tuna that they broil and serve with lemon and a light soy or temari sauce.  It's always cooked perfectly tender and completely satisfying.  Try the Fish Tacos.  It's a creative take on mexican tacos using deep-fried nori as the shell, filled with a couple different fish and avocado and topped with a house-made salsa.   And finally, while I am not a roll girl, I would recommend trying the Crunchy California Roll, which is a tempura-style deep-fried roll, the Domo Roll, which is a really luxurious baked roll topped with scallop and sauces, and the Jalapeno Hamachi,not nearly as big or as fancy as the previous two, but the juxtaposition of the sweet, soft hamachi with the crunchy, crisp, sometimes spicy jalapeno and sea salt is one that I often crave.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Got a seat at the bar and ordered what I recalled were my favourites: firecracker balls and the crunchy california roll.

The fish is always fresh and sliced generously and the sushi rice is seasoned properly.  I've been going for about three years, and now that I live in the neighborhood, I go at least twice a month.  And, while I may go alone, I never eat alone.  Ryo, the head sushi chef and manager, is unpretentious, outgoing, cool, and has great taste in music.  It's easy to sit at the bar and engage him in conversation while he prepares you some delicious sushi.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful with the menu. \n\nI like to recommend Domo as a good date place, especially for dates #1-4.  It's small and intimate with soft lighting, so everyone looks pretty good and you don't have to yell to communicate.  The seating is all counter style so you sit next to one another which can work when you're too nervous or don't want to be forced to face each other, or, when you want to be able to lean in closer or even have a reason to \"accidentally\" touch.  Finally, it's sushi.  For those fortunate enough to be on a date with someone who likes sushi, it's perfect date food, light, yet filling, allows you to show off your cultured palate and the dinner can be as long or as short as you can handle.  And to help you seal the deal, you can try going off the beaten path from the menu and order dinner from Ryo, omakase (chef's choice).\n\nWhile they don't have a \"kitchen\", there are some excellent dishes besides sushi/sashimi that are unique to Domo.  Try any of their Crudos; the Ankimo, monkfish liver pate, is made in-house, fresh, and is great for those who enjoy foie gras or duck liver pate.  The Daikon Salad, served with arugula and bonito shavings; light and refreshing while anchored with the earthy bitterness of the arugula and the delicate saltiness of the bonito and drizzled with a house dressing.  Iidako, deep-fried baby octopus served with a spicy dipping sauce, takes the pedestrian calamari to a different level.  One of my go-to favorites, and highly overlooked, is the Hamachi Kama.  The kama is the jaw or cheek of the Yellowfin Tuna that they broil and serve with lemon and a light soy or temari sauce.  It's always cooked perfectly tender and completely satisfying.  Try the Fish Tacos.  It's a creative take on mexican tacos using deep-fried nori as the shell, filled with a couple different fish and avocado and topped with a house-made salsa.   And finally, while I am not a roll girl, I would recommend trying the Crunchy California Roll, which is a tempura-style deep-fried roll, the Domo Roll, which is a really luxurious baked roll topped with scallop and sauces, and the Jalapeno Hamachi,not nearly as big or as fancy as the previous two, but the juxtaposition of the sweet, soft hamachi with the crunchy, crisp, sometimes spicy jalapeno and sea salt is one that I often crave.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorites are the Sake Toro, Domo Roll, Albacore Tetake, and Uni.

But all the sashimi I tasted here were so fresh it's comparable or even better than those high-end Japanese places like Sakae and Sushi Tomi people rave about...  The uni was so sweet and the toro melted in my mouth... everything was just so fresh! \n\nIf you like rolls, try their Domo roll or Hulk roll... Albacore tataki was also very tasty, tuna tartar was delicious, and their hamachi kama was so good I wanted to order one all for myself. \n\nThey also have a great selection of sake and very friendly waiters and sushi chefs =) I'll definitely be back here over and over!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Very small place, perfect for 2 people - order the Fish Tacos and the Domo Roll!"], "author": "Sara B.", "review": "Very small place, perfect for 2 people - order the Fish Tacos and the Domo Roll!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["The Domo roll is hot and sooooooo yummy.

This time, we were seated upon arrival.\n\nThe food is fantastic, as I've said. This time we had the Kobe beef roll, the IC, and Domo, the Shiitake (only place that does this really well) and soup and edamame. The IC was a special roll and I believe last time we ordered a special too, so I would suggest checking out the list on the mirror. The Domo roll is hot and sooooooo yummy.
