This is coming from the lady at the register not me! \n\nI got here at 1:30pm sadly, but there was no line at all! That was nice as I was in a hurry and with every warm sandwich sold out I opted for the roast beef cold sandwich. They popped my order into a brow lunch sack in under 60 seconds. Here's the breakdown:\n\nBread - reminded me of a Hawaiian sweet roll or brioche. Paired well with the roast beef. \n\nMeat - rare tender juicy. Generous portion. Brine-y flavor. Lots of pepper grounds that bring out the flavor. Too much meat for my personal taste. \n\nOther fix-ins - fris\u00e9e pickled onions and horseradish cream cheese... Made every bite extra juicy! \n\nAlthough I didn't get the most popular thing on the menu I enjoyed what I ordered. The quality was clear from the first bite and the portion was huge (I only ate half). I usually opt for the standard turkey, bacon and avo on a dutch roll when I pop into random delis. Overall I still prefer my usual sammy to the hyped Sentinel offers.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-02-01"}], "corned beef hot sandwich": [{"excerpts": ["Got the corned beef hot sandwich due to all the reviews on here ", "and it was quite good.

The line moves very quickly here and decided to go for the Lamb and Eggplant hot sandwich as it sound interesting. \n\nYes, absolutely a instant hit for my sammie list. The sesame & poppy seed bun with lamb, eggplant, chickpea and curry herb pesto was heavenly. The ingredients combine works like magic in making this sandwich a excellent choice for a first timer.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-10-24"}]}
