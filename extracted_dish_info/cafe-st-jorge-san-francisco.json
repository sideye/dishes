If not for the price tag, I think I could have devoured at least a couple more slices. Ironically, I don't think they toasted the toast, as it was served at room temp. Do they pre-toast the toast? Gosh, I hope not.  \n\nTheir lattes are unimpressive. On my last visit, it was way too foamy and lacked that bold, delicious espresso flavor I have come to expect. No latte art, either.

Even love that they have some of the menu items written in Portuguese (like galao). \n\nI had a lovely time here having a cup of coffee and baguette with olive oil. The olive oil was great, with a sprinkle of salt layered on the bottom of the oil. \n\nI also tried the Pasteis de Nata (eggtart), which I'm a HUGE fan ever since I tried the actual pasteis from Belem, Portugal. I was a little disappointed when the nata came out a little too soft, instead of crunchier on the outside. I think it might be because they (kindly :) ) heated it up for me, so maybe next time I'll just ask to get it right off the counter. Also, try to get it without any cinnamon - for the 'real' portuguese experience. \n\nGreat atmosphere, and truly lovely interior. I heard from the staff that the owner is from Azores, Portugal. I'm glad she/he opened such a cafe. Satisfied my craving for Portuguese everything :). Will return, for breakfast or lunch - and next time, I'm getting myself some galao!", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-08-25"}], "fave bean crostini": [], "sardine crostini": []}
