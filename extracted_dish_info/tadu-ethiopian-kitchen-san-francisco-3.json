I would describe the food as tasty comfort food that you could easily develop a craving for.  Portions didn't look much when I first got it, me being a \"healthy\" eater but it was more than enough to fill me up.

Tasty with a mild spicy sauce on the side. Nicely packed, so you actually can taste the stuffing. Lamb Tibs.  Grilled tidbits with onions and spices.

If not, I would have been turned off to Ethiopian cuisine.  The restaurant was a bit in the shady area of San Francisco but well worth the trip. It was dotted with more of the homeless and indignant rather than gangs so I didn't feel unsafe when I went in the late afternoon daylight hours.\n\nFor the restaurant itself; small cafe style with about 6 small tables.  Clean, well kept, homey, and comfortable, nothing fancy.  It looked like about 60% of the business was take out.  Since this was my first experience with Ethiopian food, I didn't have a basis to compare the food with but I can tell you everything was fresh, flavorful, excellently prepared and unexpectedly well presented for a small cafe restaurant in the Tenderloin district. I would describe the food as tasty comfort food that you could easily develop a craving for.  Portions didn't look much when I first got it, me being a \"healthy\" eater but it was more than enough to fill me up.  I think the Injera bread has a lot to do with it.\n\nA family run business and I really appreciate the friendly, caring atmosphere where customers are made to feel as a guest in their \"home\", a lost art with most business nowadays. \n\nMy wife and I had the Sambussa.. Tasty with a mild spicy sauce on the side. Nicely packed, so you actually can taste the stuffing. Lamb Tibs.  Grilled tidbits with onions and spices.  This was really good having a nice seared flavor.   Vegetarian combination.  Great way to try all the different Ethiopian prepared veggies.  Each has it unique flavor, some mild, while others are a bit more spicy.  I like the spicy Misir Wot the best.  I had a small cup of Ethiopian coffee which the owner gave me for free to try We also got a complementary Baklava and Spiced tea (they forgot to give us our Spice tea during our order) (a typical example of how customers are treated as a valued and appreciated \"guest\").  Boy the Baklava was good too, being not overly sweet having a flaky pastry.\n\nAll and all, excellent experience and tasty food at a reasonable price.

"], "author": "Jessie L.", "review": "TLDR: flavorful Ethiopian food, large portions, very reasonable prices; definitely recommend for a different dining experience\n\nI've seen Tadu listed as one of the \"Best of Yelp\" Restaurants for many weeks now (maybe since its opening?). I've yet to see a place maintain a 5-star rating for so long and with 100+ reviews, so of course it made my bookmarks list. Honestly, if fellow Yelper Ben K. hadn't suggested it for dinner, I don't know if I would've ever made it here since I don't like to frequent the TL.\n\nThe restaurant is a small hole-in-the wall with maybe 5-6 tables and probably has the capacity for only 15ish people. In contrast to the surrounding TL, the inside is pretty nice and clean. The place wasn't busy yet at around 6pm on a Friday, but it filled up pretty easily and there were people waiting by the time we left.\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with Ethiopian food (like me) might be a little lost with the menu, not because there are too many options, but because everything sounds more or less the same. The menu has a few appetizers and several veggie and meat entrees, which all come with injera, a spongy sourdough crepe. I'd recommend the SAMBUSSAS as a starter and LAMB TIBS as an entree. And you can't go wrong with the VEGETARIAN COMBO, which will give you sampling of almost all the veggie entrees. The food overall was pretty tasty and I really enjoyed anything cooked with berbere (some sort of chili/spice).\n\nFor anyone who hasn't had Ethiopian food, there are no utensils (unless asked for). You basically break off pieces of injera and use it to pick up the meat/veggies or dip it in the more hummus-like veggie dishes.\n\nEntrees range from $10-15 and portion sizes are big and filling, especially with the unlimited injera. One entree can easily feed you for 2 meals, so it's definitely worth the price. Being the fatass that I am sometimes though, I ended up eating much more than I should have..\n\nService is pretty good here. Our server (who I think may have been the owner) checked in on us a few times to ask how the food was and to see if we needed more injera or water.\n\n===========\n\nSAMBUSSA ($4) - 5/5\nComes with 3. Kind of like samosas, but the dough is thinner, airier, flakier and crispier, and the inside is filled with ground beef or lentils. We got the ground beef, which was amazing! A little bit of spice and so much flavor\n\nLAMB TIBS ($14) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed in spices, onions, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, berbere]\nJuicy and delicious! The jalape\u00f1os and berbere give it a good kick, but more heat would've been even better. The dish was on the greasy side for me but tasted so good that the greasiness couldn't stop me from eating more of it\n\nVEGETARIAN COMBINATION ($12) - 4/5\nWe ordered the vegetarian banatu/firfir, but I'm pretty sure they gave us the veggie combo now that I'm looking back at my picture. The vegetarian firfir is supposed to be vegetables and pieces of injera in berbere but we definitely did not get that on our plate. The veggie combo didn't disappoint though and was a really good sampler of many of their veggie entrees\n\n     -MISIR WOT - 4.5/5\n     [split lentil sauce made w/ berbere, onions, ginger, garlic]\n     Orange/red and similar in texture to a thick tomato sauce. A little bit spicy from the berbere, which I loved. Definitely one of my favorite veggie options\n     \n     -ALICHA TIKIL GOMEN - 4.5/5\n     [cabbage, potatoes & carrots]\n     Another favorite from the combo. Not as flavorful as the misir wot but I like that it actually has veggies in it\n\n     -GOMEN - 3.5/5\n     [collard greens]\n     A little bitter but still pretty good\n\n     -KIK ALICHA WOT - 3/5\n     [chickpea cooked w/ spicy tumeric, ginger & garlic]\n     Yellow and a little thicker than hummus in texture. Not bad but didn't impress me\n\n     -BUTICHA - 3/5\n     [ground chickpeas, peppers & onions]\n     Reminded me of a potato salad in taste and mashed potatoes in texture. I actually liked the flavor but it felt pretty rich and heavy so I could only eat a few bites\n\n     -AZIFA - 3/5\n     [lentils sauteed w/ onions, jalapeno, ground mustard seeds & lemon]\n     Served cold. Also kind of rich/heavy\n\nVEGGIE MEDLEY ($10) - 4/5\n[mushrooms stir fried w/ peppers, jalapeno & berbere]\nSolid. Not super special and pretty greasy, but very flavorful\n\nKITFO ($13.50) - 3.5/5\nFlavorful lean ground beef, cooked to a nice medium rare. I liked it a lot at first but wasn't really a fan of the half raw ground texture after a bit\n\nINJERA (complimentary)\nThe entrees are served on a giant piece of injera. I've only had Ethiopian once before and didn't like the injera much because of the acidity, but was pleased with the injera here. Theirs was soft, spongy and tasted like sourdough without being too acidic. I don't really like sourdough in general so I wouldn't eat the injera on its own, but it works well with the entrees and soaks up the juices of the lamb very well", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the Beef Sambussa as an appetizer.

I asked the woman at the register what she recommended since I was unfamiliar with everything on the menu except kitfo and injera (photo: http://bit.ly/1Dt2tGn).

For my entree, I decided on the $12.50 Gomen Besega, a house specialty that takes a huge round of injera, the spongy native bread of Ethiopia, and then covers it with cooked collard greens mixed with bits of minced lamb, garlic and onion. There was a thicker version of the tomato sauce on the side, which I think mixed in mashed lentil beans, as well as a fresh salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1ESSTfG).\n\nOn top of this generous portion came a basket of rolled injera which they served like bottomless mimosas (photo: http://bit.ly/1FwgaE4).

There's a sour taste to it and I know it sounds weird but it goes very well with the food.\n\nYou eat with your hands by scooping up food with Injera (there's also extra Injera served besides the one used as the \"plate\") or if you are weak, they can give you a spoon and fork. But that defeats the whole purpose of trying this type of food - it just does not taste the same unless you eat it how it's meant to be eaten. Food was delicious and service was great. I liked everything we had.\n\nThe only qualm I have was that I felt as if the portions were a bit small. For the price we paid, I expected a little more. We were 5 hungry, growing boys, and we all felt a little hungry after we devoured our meal. \n\nAll in all, a great experience and will definitely come back!\n\nPS - don't try to correct me in my reference to the bread. It's Injera. To call it \"Injera Bread\" would be like calling lumpia \"Lumpia roll\" or Chai \"Chai Tea\".

The star of the combo was the Misir Wot, which had great flavor and a little bit of a kick to it. The other items were pretty typical and not especially interesting (have yet to have them anywhere where I thought they were great).\n\nIn addition to the vegetables, we had the lamb tibs and beef tibs. The lamb had a nice, strong lamb flavor to it. To our dismay, the beef tibs were tasteless. In addition, the two dishes are prepared in exactly the same way, so the contrast in flavors (or lack thereof) was especially noticeable.\n\nPlenty of injera for our meal (they asked if we wanted more, but we were already full). We certainly overordered as we had leftovers.\n\nOverall, this is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.

If you add another couple of bucks for the second injera you will end up close to the price point of other Ethiopian restaurants, so it's a little bit of smart price management here so as not to price them out of the hood.

While going through its menu I was surprised that it did not have a meat combo (chicken, lamb and beef stew) that I generally get in any new Ethiopian restaurant that I try, as it gives you an opportunity to try different dishes from the restaurant in one go. I decided to get the Chicken Tibs ($9.95) which is chicken sauteed with Tadu's special sauces, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos and berbere using the on-line ordering app on Yelp.\n\nA very painful part of this entire experience was reaching Tadu as it is in the heart of the hood (Tenderloin). While walking from FiDi you will cross a couple of homeless colonies spread out on the pavement and have to shoo off at-least a couple of determined panhandlers before you reach the restaurant. The good news is that my order was ready as soon as I reached and I was on my way back via a slightly longer route back that avoided the worst parts of the hood.\n\nI got decent sized container having 3 sections, the largest one of which was filled with the Chicken Tibs, while the other two had some salad and green leafy vegetables. What I liked was they had not tossed the injera on top of the food making it soggy, something that other Ethiopian restaurants are notorious for, but instead had packaged it separately. Like most Ethiopian restaurants in NorCal the injera lacked the intense sour taste that is typical of injera from restaurants in SoCal. The chicken tibs were excellent. They were juicy and had a nice spicy kick. Even the green leafy vegetables were extremely good. Overall this turned out to be a very enjoyable meal. My only complaint was that this came with only one injera bread, which left me wanting a lot more.\n\nPrice wise this particular dish was pretty cheap for Ethiopian restaurant standards. Other items like the beef and lamb tibs were around the $15 mark. If you add another couple of bucks for the second injera you will end up close to the price point of other Ethiopian restaurants, so it's a little bit of smart price management here so as not to price them out of the hood.

We also asked what \"telba\" was (I haven't seen that before), and were given free samples of it (which was good, as it was totally not what I was expecting, and I would not have enjoyed it - tasty enough, but way too thick to be particularly refreshing), and when my wife ordered a baklava for dessert, instead they gave us one for free.

The place wasn't busy yet at around 6pm on a Friday, but it filled up pretty easily and there were people waiting by the time we left.\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with Ethiopian food (like me) might be a little lost with the menu, not because there are too many options, but because everything sounds more or less the same. The menu has a few appetizers and several veggie and meat entrees, which all come with injera, a spongy sourdough crepe. I'd recommend the SAMBUSSAS as a starter and LAMB TIBS as an entree. And you can't go wrong with the VEGETARIAN COMBO, which will give you sampling of almost all the veggie entrees. The food overall was pretty tasty and I really enjoyed anything cooked with berbere (some sort of chili/spice).\n\nFor anyone who hasn't had Ethiopian food, there are no utensils (unless asked for). You basically break off pieces of injera and use it to pick up the meat/veggies or dip it in the more hummus-like veggie dishes.\n\nEntrees range from $10-15 and portion sizes are big and filling, especially with the unlimited injera. One entree can easily feed you for 2 meals, so it's definitely worth the price. Being the fatass that I am sometimes though, I ended up eating much more than I should have..\n\nService is pretty good here. Our server (who I think may have been the owner) checked in on us a few times to ask how the food was and to see if we needed more injera or water.\n\n===========\n\nSAMBUSSA ($4) - 5/5\nComes with 3. Kind of like samosas, but the dough is thinner, airier, flakier and crispier, and the inside is filled with ground beef or lentils. We got the ground beef, which was amazing! A little bit of spice and so much flavor\n\nLAMB TIBS ($14) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed in spices, onions, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, berbere]\nJuicy and delicious! The jalape\u00f1os and berbere give it a good kick, but more heat would've been even better. The dish was on the greasy side for me but tasted so good that the greasiness couldn't stop me from eating more of it\n\nVEGETARIAN COMBINATION ($12) - 4/5\nWe ordered the vegetarian banatu/firfir, but I'm pretty sure they gave us the veggie combo now that I'm looking back at my picture. The vegetarian firfir is supposed to be vegetables and pieces of injera in berbere but we definitely did not get that on our plate. The veggie combo didn't disappoint though and was a really good sampler of many of their veggie entrees\n\n     -MISIR WOT - 4.5/5\n     [split lentil sauce made w/ berbere, onions, ginger, garlic]\n     Orange/red and similar in texture to a thick tomato sauce. A little bit spicy from the berbere, which I loved. Definitely one of my favorite veggie options\n     \n     -ALICHA TIKIL GOMEN - 4.5/5\n     [cabbage, potatoes & carrots]\n     Another favorite from the combo. Not as flavorful as the misir wot but I like that it actually has veggies in it\n\n     -GOMEN - 3.5/5\n     [collard greens]\n     A little bitter but still pretty good\n\n     -KIK ALICHA WOT - 3/5\n     [chickpea cooked w/ spicy tumeric, ginger & garlic]\n     Yellow and a little thicker than hummus in texture. Not bad but didn't impress me\n\n     -BUTICHA - 3/5\n     [ground chickpeas, peppers & onions]\n     Reminded me of a potato salad in taste and mashed potatoes in texture. I actually liked the flavor but it felt pretty rich and heavy so I could only eat a few bites\n\n     -AZIFA - 3/5\n     [lentils sauteed w/ onions, jalapeno, ground mustard seeds & lemon]\n     Served cold. Also kind of rich/heavy\n\nVEGGIE MEDLEY ($10) - 4/5\n[mushrooms stir fried w/ peppers, jalapeno & berbere]\nSolid. Not super special and pretty greasy, but very flavorful\n\nKITFO ($13.50) - 3.5/5\nFlavorful lean ground beef, cooked to a nice medium rare. I liked it a lot at first but wasn't really a fan of the half raw ground texture after a bit\n\nINJERA (complimentary)\nThe entrees are served on a giant piece of injera. I've only had Ethiopian once before and didn't like the injera much because of the acidity, but was pleased with the injera here. Theirs was soft, spongy and tasted like sourdough without being too acidic. I don't really like sourdough in general so I wouldn't eat the injera on its own, but it works well with the entrees and soaks up the juices of the lamb very well", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Next up, the vegetarian combo, beef berebere banatu, firfir, lamb tibs, and shiro ", "wot "], "author": "Shereen A.", "review": "Tadu freaking ROCKS!\n\nWas really craving Ethiopian food and after not finding anything comparable to Seattle, I decided I didn't care and wanted to try this place (the five stars lured me in).\n\nThe first time we came here, it was an hour before closing to find that there were no seats and it was SUPER packed.

Tadu is the highest rated Ethiopian spot in the city, one of the highest overall in the Tenderloin, and I live 10 minutes walk away, so it seemed like a match made in heaven.  I had some trouble finding the place because it's kind of hidden away, so I encourage you to plan routes and save maps before you go, just in case.  Once you find it, and figure out that the door closes automatically behind you (weird slow door, everyone makes the same mistake), you step inside and see only 5-6 tables.  I was trying this place out with fellow Yelper Jessie L., as both of us hadn't had the pleasure of having 5-star Ethiopian food.  It's good we came at 6PM sharp, because when we left at 7, there were 7-8 people waiting outside on the sidewalk.  \n\nOn a recommendation from a friend (who lived in Ethiopia), we ordered the vegetarian firfir, but I believe we got the vegetarian combo instead (I didn't notice this).  We also got the lamb tibs, and the beef sambussas as an appetizer.  Appetizers come out separately, and for the mains you have the choice of individual plates or one large plate for all the entrees.  I recommend getting the traditional large plate!  It's a nice change of pace from everywhere else, it's good for groups, and you get a nice big injera that soaks up the flavor from the food and becomes a different taste in every bite.  One big plus is the extra injera (spongy pancake-y crepe-y thing) with free refills if you need it.  We didn't - 2 main entrees and 1 basket of injera was more than enough, and most of the foods are high in carbs.\n\nThe sambussas were nice - would have liked 4 pieces instead of 3, and maybe cooked a little more (in comparison, Greek spanakopita is similar and is usually browned and crispy on the outer layer - this was just a little bit crispy on the outside and soft inside.  The beef filling was moist and packed a punch of flavor.\n\nThe lamb tibs were cooked well and there was enough for 2 people - here again the flavor was very nice but not overpowering.  I loved mixing the lamb tibs with different parts of the vegetarian combo inside a piece of injera - injera lamb wraps!  Vegetarian combo was a nice variety of what they can make - I only wish we were able to try the firfir.  \n\nOverall I'd say 4 to 4.5 stars.  Value for money was good, and service was good, as you may expect in such small confines.

I've yet to see a place maintain a 5-star rating for so long and with 100+ reviews, so of course it made my bookmarks list. Honestly, if fellow Yelper Ben K. hadn't suggested it for dinner, I don't know if I would've ever made it here since I don't like to frequent the TL.\n\nThe restaurant is a small hole-in-the wall with maybe 5-6 tables and probably has the capacity for only 15ish people. In contrast to the surrounding TL, the inside is pretty nice and clean. The place wasn't busy yet at around 6pm on a Friday, but it filled up pretty easily and there were people waiting by the time we left.\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with Ethiopian food (like me) might be a little lost with the menu, not because there are too many options, but because everything sounds more or less the same. The menu has a few appetizers and several veggie and meat entrees, which all come with injera, a spongy sourdough crepe. I'd recommend the SAMBUSSAS as a starter and LAMB TIBS as an entree. And you can't go wrong with the VEGETARIAN COMBO, which will give you sampling of almost all the veggie entrees. The food overall was pretty tasty and I really enjoyed anything cooked with berbere (some sort of chili/spice).\n\nFor anyone who hasn't had Ethiopian food, there are no utensils (unless asked for). You basically break off pieces of injera and use it to pick up the meat/veggies or dip it in the more hummus-like veggie dishes.\n\nEntrees range from $10-15 and portion sizes are big and filling, especially with the unlimited injera. One entree can easily feed you for 2 meals, so it's definitely worth the price. Being the fatass that I am sometimes though, I ended up eating much more than I should have..\n\nService is pretty good here. Our server (who I think may have been the owner) checked in on us a few times to ask how the food was and to see if we needed more injera or water.\n\n===========\n\nSAMBUSSA ($4) - 5/5\nComes with 3. Kind of like samosas, but the dough is thinner, airier, flakier and crispier, and the inside is filled with ground beef or lentils. We got the ground beef, which was amazing! A little bit of spice and so much flavor\n\nLAMB TIBS ($14) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed in spices, onions, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, berbere]\nJuicy and delicious! The jalape\u00f1os and berbere give it a good kick, but more heat would've been even better. The dish was on the greasy side for me but tasted so good that the greasiness couldn't stop me from eating more of it\n\nVEGETARIAN COMBINATION ($12) - 4/5\nWe ordered the vegetarian banatu/firfir, but I'm pretty sure they gave us the veggie combo now that I'm looking back at my picture. The vegetarian firfir is supposed to be vegetables and pieces of injera in berbere but we definitely did not get that on our plate. The veggie combo didn't disappoint though and was a really good sampler of many of their veggie entrees\n\n     -MISIR WOT - 4.5/5\n     [split lentil sauce made w/ berbere, onions, ginger, garlic]\n     Orange/red and similar in texture to a thick tomato sauce. A little bit spicy from the berbere, which I loved. Definitely one of my favorite veggie options\n     \n     -ALICHA TIKIL GOMEN - 4.5/5\n     [cabbage, potatoes & carrots]\n     Another favorite from the combo. Not as flavorful as the misir wot but I like that it actually has veggies in it\n\n     -GOMEN - 3.5/5\n     [collard greens]\n     A little bitter but still pretty good\n\n     -KIK ALICHA WOT - 3/5\n     [chickpea cooked w/ spicy tumeric, ginger & garlic]\n     Yellow and a little thicker than hummus in texture. Not bad but didn't impress me\n\n     -BUTICHA - 3/5\n     [ground chickpeas, peppers & onions]\n     Reminded me of a potato salad in taste and mashed potatoes in texture. I actually liked the flavor but it felt pretty rich and heavy so I could only eat a few bites\n\n     -AZIFA - 3/5\n     [lentils sauteed w/ onions, jalapeno, ground mustard seeds & lemon]\n     Served cold. Also kind of rich/heavy\n\nVEGGIE MEDLEY ($10) - 4/5\n[mushrooms stir fried w/ peppers, jalapeno & berbere]\nSolid. Not super special and pretty greasy, but very flavorful\n\nKITFO ($13.50) - 3.5/5\nFlavorful lean ground beef, cooked to a nice medium rare. I liked it a lot at first but wasn't really a fan of the half raw ground texture after a bit\n\nINJERA (complimentary)\nThe entrees are served on a giant piece of injera. I've only had Ethiopian once before and didn't like the injera much because of the acidity, but was pleased with the injera here. Theirs was soft, spongy and tasted like sourdough without being too acidic.

Again a waft of positive Yelp reviews gave me the courage to gird my loins after dark and find my way to Ellis between Leavenworth and Jones where this cafe resides. Even though it was just past 8PM by the time I arrived, it was nearly full up with diners who didn't look like they were going anywhere soon. Luckily by the time I ordered at the counter, the front table opened up. I asked the woman at the register what she recommended since I was unfamiliar with everything on the menu except kitfo and injera (photo: http://bit.ly/1Dt2tGn). Kitfo is a bit like Hamburger Helper, Ethiopian style, which is not a bad thing but probably more meat-heavy than I had in mind for an entree.\n\nIn the meantime, who wouldn't want to start with an Ethiopian empanada called Sambussa, where you get three large, deep-fried turnover-like creations filled with lentil beans, onions and peppers? A trio for $4 struck me as a good deal, and it was, especially with a huge ramekin of a light marinara-like tomato sauce for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/1EST1vN). For my entree, I decided on the $12.50 Gomen Besega, a house specialty that takes a huge round of injera, the spongy native bread of Ethiopia, and then covers it with cooked collard greens mixed with bits of minced lamb, garlic and onion. There was a thicker version of the tomato sauce on the side, which I think mixed in mashed lentil beans, as well as a fresh salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1ESSTfG).\n\nOn top of this generous portion came a basket of rolled injera which they served like bottomless mimosas (photo: http://bit.ly/1FwgaE4). By the time I depleted half of it, more injera came out as if it somehow multiplied in the kitchen. No matter since I happen to be a fan, and this one had a less vinegary taste than I've had at other Ethiopian spots. I was full by the time I was halfway through my entree, so I asked for a box which they happily provided. The owner came by to see if I enjoyed the food, and he shared with me his story about being a cabbie who dreamed of opening a place where he could serve his grandmother's recipes. Mission accomplished as the food has a very home-style flavor to it that tempers the exotic aspects of the cuisine.
