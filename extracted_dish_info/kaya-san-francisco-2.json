The salt fish in the jamaican breakfast added a nice savoriness to the scramble. I wasn't eating deep fried foods at the time, so I couldn't try the fritters, but I really liked the chimichurri. Was great as a sauce with other dishes. Make sure to also try their hot sauces if you'd like a little kick to your dishes. The french toast syrup was delicious!

I thought they were juice heavy as I really only like a splash for color. Out of the three, I liked the tartness of the passionfruit. I found the blood orange too sweet. Though some in our party mixed the two together and found a good balance. I don't know how the rum punch bowl serves four as it's huge! It drank our party of eight with quite a few extra glasses left. I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but I didn't mind it here. The punch was pretty stiff at first sip, but seemed to mellow out with drinking. If you're a big coffee drinker, they only do french presses here, so I'd suggest getting your caffeine fix elsewhere.

The Rum-Filled Coconut, paired w/ a closing coup de gr\u00e2ce pairing of Red Stripe, was refreshing w/ the extracted coconut water and the effervescent rum. The biggest disappointment was the Rude Boi: the consistency was decent only for 1/5th of the cocktail, then it devolved into something of a \"sparkling Midori\" that was watered-down & left a terrible aside for my last few oxtail bites. Would've just gone for another Rum Punch instead, but oh well that's why I'm experimenting for you Yelpers!\n\nOverall, the meal was a pricey one, a few buckaroos over $100, for everything above (18% service charge included).

First, as others have commented, the background music--really foreground music--is loud, so it's not a place where conversation is easy. The design of the restaurant, however, is inviting and very chic, with a tall wall of liquors providing the backdrop. Now to the food: all of us agreed that it was tasty! The portion sizes vary, however. My wife's piri-piri chicken was a half bird with plenty of meat and accompaniments. My goat curry was bony, as goat tends to be, so there really was very little meat; I would have been hungry if I were not able to finish off the chicken that my wife couldn't eat. The curried vegetables ordered by one friend was ample enough that he took some home. The grilled wild gulf shrimp ordered by the other friend was billed as a small eat, but she had trouble consuming it because it was so spicy. We all  sampled the salt fish fritters, which some of us really liked and others not so much. Likewise, we shared a slice of Jamaican black cake, which was very dense with hints of rum that reminded us of a Christmas cake. Two of us consumed most of it, with the others satisfied by a small bite. My wife really enjoyed her pomegranate mint soda, but my spicy ginger beer really didn't taste very gingery or spicy at all. I'd opt for the mint soda. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but considering the prices of the big plates, we felt that the value wasn't there.

While the shrimp was cooked well, that pungent sweet and sour tartness was just not there. The tamarind flavor was too mellow but perhaps that was their intention since it may be too potent for some.\n\nAs a litmus test of solid Caribbean restaurant, we ultimately decided to go with the Jerk Chicken ($24) for our shared entr\u00e9e: http://bit.ly/2DrbW6k. Our second server was kind enough to allow us to order dark meat only (thanks to my yelp friend, Adrienne H. on the heads up of the dry white meat).\n\nI like it HAWT and baby, this jerk chicken was fiyaaah - my mouth turned into a burning furnace on this chilly night. BUT, it didn't taste like jerk chicken. While it had great heat, it was missing the robust, complex spices one would associate from a good jerk chicken. My friend said, it tasted like a spicy blackened chicken and I agree. The chicken was tender but not fall off the bone tender. The accompanying fluffy rice and nicely caramelized plantains were our favorite items on the plate.\n\nService was a bit spotty but it's barely week two so it's understandable. After taking our drink and appetizer order, our server never came back to check on us or to take the remainder of our order...but she did check in with tables next to us. \n\nWhen we were looking for our server, the young server with the beard stepped right in. He was great, he took our entree order and checked in with us several times - thank you! The host was nice too and jumped in to clear our empty plates.\n\nThe dining room is still hip and dark (from the Alta CA days) with the addition of cool art from Caribbean artists and a Jamacian movie streaming on the projector screen. Not much sound dampening so it can get loud if it's a full house. \n\nWhile there's not a strong presence of Jamaican food in SF, it's hard to justify paying these prices again at Kaya since the food and drinks were very disappointing. The bold, Caribbean flavors just weren't there for us at Kaya or maybe this is Caribbean food for techbros?\n\nYou can find much better Jamaican food elsewhere and for a fraction of the cost (~40% less) at Flavas (SSF), Coconuts (PA), Back A Yard (MP & SJ), or even Cha Cha Cha (SF).", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-01-22"}, {"excerpts": ["What I ordered: \n- SALT FISH FRITTERS\n- GRILLED WILD GULF SHRIMP\n- SAUTE\u00c9D STRING BEANS\n", "- JERK CHCIKEN SALAD"], "author": "Jenn L.", "review": "Such a great Jamaican style meal!

Although we enjoyed the novelty of Jamaican food, my wife and I decided that one visit was sufficient. First, as others have commented, the background music--really foreground music--is loud, so it's not a place where conversation is easy. The design of the restaurant, however, is inviting and very chic, with a tall wall of liquors providing the backdrop. Now to the food: all of us agreed that it was tasty! The portion sizes vary, however. My wife's piri-piri chicken was a half bird with plenty of meat and accompaniments. My goat curry was bony, as goat tends to be, so there really was very little meat; I would have been hungry if I were not able to finish off the chicken that my wife couldn't eat. The curried vegetables ordered by one friend was ample enough that he took some home. The grilled wild gulf shrimp ordered by the other friend was billed as a small eat, but she had trouble consuming it because it was so spicy. We all  sampled the salt fish fritters, which some of us really liked and others not so much. Likewise, we shared a slice of Jamaican black cake, which was very dense with hints of rum that reminded us of a Christmas cake. Two of us consumed most of it, with the others satisfied by a small bite. My wife really enjoyed her pomegranate mint soda, but my spicy ginger beer really didn't taste very gingery or spicy at all. I'd opt for the mint soda. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but considering the prices of the big plates, we felt that the value wasn't there.

My group does love trying everything. I adored the salmon and the jamaican breakfast. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Still silky and moist. The salt fish in the jamaican breakfast added a nice savoriness to the scramble. I wasn't eating deep fried foods at the time, so I couldn't try the fritters, but I really liked the chimichurri. Was great as a sauce with other dishes. Make sure to also try their hot sauces if you'd like a little kick to your dishes. The french toast syrup was delicious! I don't know what alcohol was in it (probably rum?), but boy, did it pack a punch. We just kept dipping everything in it: the fruit, the cornbread, just whatever went with syrup.

I thought they were juice heavy as I really only like a splash for color. Out of the three, I liked the tartness of the passionfruit. I found the blood orange too sweet. Though some in our party mixed the two together and found a good balance. I don't know how the rum punch bowl serves four as it's huge! It drank our party of eight with quite a few extra glasses left. I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but I didn't mind it here. The punch was pretty stiff at first sip, but seemed to mellow out with drinking. If you're a big coffee drinker, they only do french presses here, so I'd suggest getting your caffeine fix elsewhere. The pots didn't yield many coffee cups.\n\nA fun new brunch spot.

There were lots of plantains and papaya in those dishes, and fruit-and-meat combos can be a dicey proposition if executed poorly. However, this place boasts a true expert, chef Nigel James of Oakland's Kingston 11, in partnership with Daniel Patterson whose restaurant Alta was the previous occupant. I was underwhelmed with the overzealous California cuisine of that operation (review: http://bit.ly/2pMFjun), so I tried to keep an open mind about Kaya.

Kitchen was open & people can walk through to get to the restrooms, which I think is pretty cool as long as us eaters aren't too nasty around it...\n\nFood: Had the Salt Fish Fritters and the Oxtail Stew.

The oxtail stew, WOW this dish is excellent.

This was the best part of the meal, by far. Great to have tried such a wonderful centerpiece for the dinner.\n\nDrinks: Rum Punch + Rude Boi + Rum-Filled Coconut. The Rum Punch started out bitter, but gradually it delivered some really great citrus kicks. Wish I could have a bowl of this, but I'll have to bring some friends next time! The Rum-Filled Coconut, paired w/ a closing coup de gr\u00e2ce pairing of Red Stripe, was refreshing w/ the extracted coconut water and the effervescent rum. The biggest disappointment was the Rude Boi: the consistency was decent only for 1/5th of the cocktail, then it devolved into something of a \"sparkling Midori\" that was watered-down & left a terrible aside for my last few oxtail bites. Would've just gone for another Rum Punch instead, but oh well that's why I'm experimenting for you Yelpers!\n\nOverall, the meal was a pricey one, a few buckaroos over $100, for everything above (18% service charge included). Was it worth it? Just for the cocktails & fritters, probably not. The Oxtail Stew did its job to elevate the whole experience to above-average, while I would be amiss to remind that this place is still in its opening weeks.

I thought it was pretty good but again probably a little too sweet for what I was hoping from a salad.\n\nMy entree was the $19 Curried Vegetables, a rather hefty if somewhat pricey bowl of broccoli, green beans, carrots, chayote (cho cho), sweet and Irish potatoes, peas, and more of the caramelized plantains covered in a thick Jamaican curry (photo: http://bit.ly/2uqfq9r). The ingredients were fine, but the result was a little too heavy and unfortunately a bit bland. I was really hoping Kaya would be better than my previous dining experience at Alta, but I felt somehow it was another near-miss for Patterson.

Although we enjoyed the novelty of Jamaican food, my wife and I decided that one visit was sufficient. First, as others have commented, the background music--really foreground music--is loud, so it's not a place where conversation is easy. The design of the restaurant, however, is inviting and very chic, with a tall wall of liquors providing the backdrop. Now to the food: all of us agreed that it was tasty! The portion sizes vary, however. My wife's piri-piri chicken was a half bird with plenty of meat and accompaniments. My goat curry was bony, as goat tends to be, so there really was very little meat; I would have been hungry if I were not able to finish off the chicken that my wife couldn't eat. The curried vegetables ordered by one friend was ample enough that he took some home. The grilled wild gulf shrimp ordered by the other friend was billed as a small eat, but she had trouble consuming it because it was so spicy. We all  sampled the salt fish fritters, which some of us really liked and others not so much. Likewise, we shared a slice of Jamaican black cake, which was very dense with hints of rum that reminded us of a Christmas cake. Two of us consumed most of it, with the others satisfied by a small bite. My wife really enjoyed her pomegranate mint soda, but my spicy ginger beer really didn't taste very gingery or spicy at all. I'd opt for the mint soda. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but considering the prices of the big plates, we felt that the value wasn't there.

You can always tell a good Caribbean place by their patties so, without this taste, I can't give a full assessment, but I'll go ahead and talk about the non-patty experience I had.\n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nKaya is super hip. They have gorgeous wooden tables accented with colored chairs and a fun bar in the middle of the restaurant. A projector casts films on one of the walls as the packed restaurant fills with a social buzz. The restaurant is not in the greatest location, but it's gentrifying quickly so it's not too bad. You can see the kitchen in the back and if you're lucky enough to get a seat by it, it smells SOOOO GOOOD. \n\nFOOD:\n\nI'll quickly cover the drinks first:\n\nI started off with the Rum Punch - wray + nephew, lime, strawberry, pineapple, orange, coconut. It definitely tasted like rum with food coloring and I just couldn't down it. I kept trying through my appetizers but it honestly tasted like they forgot some of the ingredients. Like, I actually think the drink was just a mistake. In any case, they didn't charge me for it which was really nice.\n\nI swapped it out for a Deep Dub which was AMAZING. It was sweet and tasted like a pina colada. I would definitely get it again. Pretty sure I could feel the island breeze as I drank it.\n\nApps:\nI got the plantains of course, which were cooked SO well. Lovely flavor, lovely caramelized crunch with a warm, soft inside. Heaven.\n\nI also got the Gulf Shrimp which were okay. They are super sweet and could use a kick. I thought there might be some spice in it but it was pure sweet and it just threw me off. The shrimp themselves were big and juicy. Mmmm.\n\nFinally, I got the string beans which were salty but somehow, everything I needed. I would order them again in an instant!\n\nThe apps were the best part of the meal, as the main course floundered. \n\nI got the black pepper crab. We have a black pepper crab where I'm from so I thought it would be similar -- it's not. The crab is in the shell but easy to crack open, and there's a lot of meat. However, the sauce isn't really able to make it into the meat so it just sits on the shell and you can dip your meat into the sauce, but a good crab is infused with flavor, and this crab just didn't have it. The sauce is sweet, not spicy (it says sweet and spicy) and very sticky, but they'll give you a hot towel, so don't worry about that. The sweet sauce again was just okay... needed way more spice!\n\nMy friend got the Oxtail. It was good, cooked so well. Tender, amazing... It was just a small portion (mostly bone) so for the price, it was questionable. That being said, it was good. 7.5/10 and would maybe order it again. \n\nI wouldn't order the crab again. \n\n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was fine. People were nice. They didn't charge me for my botched drink. I felt like the staff was attentive but didn't pressure me to pay the bill even though it was packed.\n\nPRICES: \n\nPrices are expensive for the flavor, but normal for the city. If I wanted to pay $180 I would probably go elsewhere, but I get that SF prices are just sky high. Not ideal but I'm on board if everyone else is. Would prefer a $5 patty and $8 jerk chicken from a hole-in-the-wall place though.\n\nTL;DR\n\nNot the best Caribbean place and there are better ones at cheaper prices, but I'll probably be back.

Although we enjoyed the novelty of Jamaican food, my wife and I decided that one visit was sufficient. First, as others have commented, the background music--really foreground music--is loud, so it's not a place where conversation is easy. The design of the restaurant, however, is inviting and very chic, with a tall wall of liquors providing the backdrop. Now to the food: all of us agreed that it was tasty! The portion sizes vary, however. My wife's piri-piri chicken was a half bird with plenty of meat and accompaniments. My goat curry was bony, as goat tends to be, so there really was very little meat; I would have been hungry if I were not able to finish off the chicken that my wife couldn't eat. The curried vegetables ordered by one friend was ample enough that he took some home. The grilled wild gulf shrimp ordered by the other friend was billed as a small eat, but she had trouble consuming it because it was so spicy. We all  sampled the salt fish fritters, which some of us really liked and others not so much. Likewise, we shared a slice of Jamaican black cake, which was very dense with hints of rum that reminded us of a Christmas cake. Two of us consumed most of it, with the others satisfied by a small bite. My wife really enjoyed her pomegranate mint soda, but my spicy ginger beer really didn't taste very gingery or spicy at all. I'd opt for the mint soda. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but considering the prices of the big plates, we felt that the value wasn't there.

I have found some great hole-in-the-wall places with cheap eats packed with flavor. If you're a fan of Caribbean food too, you'll understand why this is important: This review was written without having tasted the Beef Patties.\n\nThat's right, the beef patties are NOT available for dinner. You can always tell a good Caribbean place by their patties so, without this taste, I can't give a full assessment, but I'll go ahead and talk about the non-patty experience I had.\n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nKaya is super hip. They have gorgeous wooden tables accented with colored chairs and a fun bar in the middle of the restaurant. A projector casts films on one of the walls as the packed restaurant fills with a social buzz. The restaurant is not in the greatest location, but it's gentrifying quickly so it's not too bad. You can see the kitchen in the back and if you're lucky enough to get a seat by it, it smells SOOOO GOOOD. \n\nFOOD:\n\nI'll quickly cover the drinks first:\n\nI started off with the Rum Punch - wray + nephew, lime, strawberry, pineapple, orange, coconut. It definitely tasted like rum with food coloring and I just couldn't down it. I kept trying through my appetizers but it honestly tasted like they forgot some of the ingredients. Like, I actually think the drink was just a mistake. In any case, they didn't charge me for it which was really nice.\n\nI swapped it out for a Deep Dub which was AMAZING. It was sweet and tasted like a pina colada. I would definitely get it again. Pretty sure I could feel the island breeze as I drank it.\n\nApps:\nI got the plantains of course, which were cooked SO well. Lovely flavor, lovely caramelized crunch with a warm, soft inside. Heaven.\n\nI also got the Gulf Shrimp which were okay. They are super sweet and could use a kick. I thought there might be some spice in it but it was pure sweet and it just threw me off. The shrimp themselves were big and juicy. Mmmm.\n\nFinally, I got the string beans which were salty but somehow, everything I needed. I would order them again in an instant!\n\nThe apps were the best part of the meal, as the main course floundered. \n\nI got the black pepper crab. We have a black pepper crab where I'm from so I thought it would be similar -- it's not. The crab is in the shell but easy to crack open, and there's a lot of meat. However, the sauce isn't really able to make it into the meat so it just sits on the shell and you can dip your meat into the sauce, but a good crab is infused with flavor, and this crab just didn't have it. The sauce is sweet, not spicy (it says sweet and spicy) and very sticky, but they'll give you a hot towel, so don't worry about that. The sweet sauce again was just okay... needed way more spice!\n\nMy friend got the Oxtail. It was good, cooked so well. Tender, amazing... It was just a small portion (mostly bone) so for the price, it was questionable. That being said, it was good. 7.5/10 and would maybe order it again. \n\nI wouldn't order the crab again. \n\n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was fine. People were nice. They didn't charge me for my botched drink. I felt like the staff was attentive but didn't pressure me to pay the bill even though it was packed.\n\nPRICES: \n\nPrices are expensive for the flavor, but normal for the city. If I wanted to pay $180 I would probably go elsewhere, but I get that SF prices are just sky high. Not ideal but I'm on board if everyone else is. Would prefer a $5 patty and $8 jerk chicken from a hole-in-the-wall place though.\n\nTL;DR\n\nNot the best Caribbean place and there are better ones at cheaper prices, but I'll probably be back.

My group does love trying everything. I adored the salmon and the jamaican breakfast. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Still silky and moist. The salt fish in the jamaican breakfast added a nice savoriness to the scramble. I wasn't eating deep fried foods at the time, so I couldn't try the fritters, but I really liked the chimichurri. Was great as a sauce with other dishes. Make sure to also try their hot sauces if you'd like a little kick to your dishes. The french toast syrup was delicious! I don't know what alcohol was in it (probably rum?), but boy, did it pack a punch. We just kept dipping everything in it: the fruit, the cornbread, just whatever went with syrup. Yum!\n\n*MIMOSA: make it a pitcher ($25 each); blood orange x1, mango x1, passion fruit x1\n*NEGRIL-ONI: smith + cross, campari, sweet vermouth ($12)\n*RUM PUNCH: wray + nephew, lime, strawberry, pineapple, orange, coconut ($50 punch bowl)\n*FRENCH PRESS COFFEE ($10) x2\n\nSince it was brunch, we decided to try all three mimosas. I thought they were juice heavy as I really only like a splash for color. Out of the three, I liked the tartness of the passionfruit. I found the blood orange too sweet.

You can always tell a good Caribbean place by their patties so, without this taste, I can't give a full assessment, but I'll go ahead and talk about the non-patty experience I had.\n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nKaya is super hip. They have gorgeous wooden tables accented with colored chairs and a fun bar in the middle of the restaurant. A projector casts films on one of the walls as the packed restaurant fills with a social buzz. The restaurant is not in the greatest location, but it's gentrifying quickly so it's not too bad. You can see the kitchen in the back and if you're lucky enough to get a seat by it, it smells SOOOO GOOOD. \n\nFOOD:\n\nI'll quickly cover the drinks first:\n\nI started off with the Rum Punch - wray + nephew, lime, strawberry, pineapple, orange, coconut. It definitely tasted like rum with food coloring and I just couldn't down it. I kept trying through my appetizers but it honestly tasted like they forgot some of the ingredients.

It was sweet and tasted like a pina colada. I would definitely get it again. Pretty sure I could feel the island breeze as I drank it.\n\nApps:\nI got the plantains of course, which were cooked SO well. Lovely flavor, lovely caramelized crunch with a warm, soft inside. Heaven.\n\nI also got the Gulf Shrimp which were okay. They are super sweet and could use a kick. I thought there might be some spice in it but it was pure sweet and it just threw me off. The shrimp themselves were big and juicy. Mmmm.\n\nFinally, I got the string beans which were salty but somehow, everything I needed. I would order them again in an instant!\n\nThe apps were the best part of the meal, as the main course floundered. \n\nI got the black pepper crab. We have a black pepper crab where I'm from so I thought it would be similar -- it's not. The crab is in the shell but easy to crack open, and there's a lot of meat. However, the sauce isn't really able to make it into the meat so it just sits on the shell and you can dip your meat into the sauce, but a good crab is infused with flavor, and this crab just didn't have it. The sauce is sweet, not spicy (it says sweet and spicy) and very sticky, but they'll give you a hot towel, so don't worry about that. The sweet sauce again was just okay... needed way more spice!\n\nMy friend got the Oxtail. It was good, cooked so well. Tender, amazing... It was just a small portion (mostly bone) so for the price, it was questionable. That being said, it was good. 7.5/10 and would maybe order it again. \n\nI wouldn't order the crab again. \n\n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was fine. People were nice. They didn't charge me for my botched drink. I felt like the staff was attentive but didn't pressure me to pay the bill even though it was packed.\n\nPRICES: \n\nPrices are expensive for the flavor, but normal for the city. If I wanted to pay $180 I would probably go elsewhere, but I get that SF prices are just sky high. Not ideal but I'm on board if everyone else is. Would prefer a $5 patty and $8 jerk chicken from a hole-in-the-wall place though.\n\nTL;DR\n\nNot the best Caribbean place and there are better ones at cheaper prices, but I'll probably be back.

There were lots of plantains and papaya in those dishes, and fruit-and-meat combos can be a dicey proposition if executed poorly. However, this place boasts a true expert, chef Nigel James of Oakland's Kingston 11, in partnership with Daniel Patterson whose restaurant Alta was the previous occupant. I was underwhelmed with the overzealous California cuisine of that operation (review: http://bit.ly/2pMFjun), so I tried to keep an open mind about Kaya. You know how hard that was for me to do since the vibe was virtually identical to Alta.\n\nI came here after working out at the gym, so I was already self-conscious about how casual I looked. I slithered up to the bar and decided to start things off with an $8 Spicy Ginger Beer since I wanted something tropical and non-alcoholic (photo: http://bit.ly/2E11x0O). It was pretty refreshing but a tad too sweetly fermented for my taste. For my starter, I ordered the $11 Papaya + Greens, which mixed pickled papaya slices, Granny Smith apple slices, caramelized plaintains, and greens with their house vinaigrette in a good-size bowl (photo: http://bit.ly/2pNdBxs). I thought it was pretty good but again probably a little too sweet for what I was hoping from a salad.\n\nMy entree was the $19 Curried Vegetables, a rather hefty if somewhat pricey bowl of broccoli, green beans, carrots, chayote (cho cho), sweet and Irish potatoes, peas, and more of the caramelized plantains covered in a thick Jamaican curry (photo: http://bit.ly/2uqfq9r). The ingredients were fine, but the result was a little too heavy and unfortunately a bit bland. I was really hoping Kaya would be better than my previous dining experience at Alta, but I felt somehow it was another near-miss for Patterson. I'm not averse to unique cuisines, but I think I may need to do a restart when I try Caribbean food again. After all, the oxtail stew and goat curry sound calorifically good.\n\nDay me say day me say day me say day o\nDaylight come and me wanna go home\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the ingredients seemed tight but the flavors were on the sweet side and often bland\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still the same dark, trendy space that Alta was\nSERVICE - 4 stars...the bartenders were most attentive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...my check done come and me wanna go home", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-03-27"}, {"excerpts": ["I enjoyed my spicy ginger beer ", "- it was a surprisingly good non-alcoholic beverage.

Although we enjoyed the novelty of Jamaican food, my wife and I decided that one visit was sufficient. First, as others have commented, the background music--really foreground music--is loud, so it's not a place where conversation is easy. The design of the restaurant, however, is inviting and very chic, with a tall wall of liquors providing the backdrop. Now to the food: all of us agreed that it was tasty! The portion sizes vary, however. My wife's piri-piri chicken was a half bird with plenty of meat and accompaniments. My goat curry was bony, as goat tends to be, so there really was very little meat; I would have been hungry if I were not able to finish off the chicken that my wife couldn't eat. The curried vegetables ordered by one friend was ample enough that he took some home. The grilled wild gulf shrimp ordered by the other friend was billed as a small eat, but she had trouble consuming it because it was so spicy. We all  sampled the salt fish fritters, which some of us really liked and others not so much. Likewise, we shared a slice of Jamaican black cake, which was very dense with hints of rum that reminded us of a Christmas cake. Two of us consumed most of it, with the others satisfied by a small bite. My wife really enjoyed her pomegranate mint soda, but my spicy ginger beer really didn't taste very gingery or spicy at all. I'd opt for the mint soda. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but considering the prices of the big plates, we felt that the value wasn't there.
