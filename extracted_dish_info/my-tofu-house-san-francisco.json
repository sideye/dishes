They offered a limited selection of Korean comfort dishes that we have all come to love  - Tofu Stews, Bibimbab, Korean BBQs and savory Pancakes. The menu is small and these traditional favorites made up the entire menu. We ordered the Seafood Tofu Stew, Bibimbab and Fried Noodles Soft Tofu to share. Some entrees were missing the wow factor. One was particularly hearty and outstanding with a good kick. Prices of some were steep for what you get. I was taken aback by the sky-high price tags on the Pancakes and BBQs. Lightheartedly, we needed to save face and not behave like el cheapos by leaving! So we did the right thing but skipped the pancakes and BBQs!\n \nHowever, where Tofu House surpassed others was in their banchan. Every dish of banchan from the proverbial kimchee to the fish cakes, daikon, cucumbers and bean sprouts were garlicky, deliciously marinated and seasoned with authentic Korean spices. The standout was not kimchee but the small fried yellow croaker fish. They were nicely salted with delicate mild flavors.\n\nThe Seafood Soft Tofu ($14.98) was served in a steaming cauldron of soft tofu stew. The stew was teeming with clams but they skimped on other ingredients. There were a few small shrimps with heads and shells and one piece (yes, one piece) of oyster. Nonetheless, I have to admit the stew tasted phenomenal albeit a little briny, which was expected being a seafood stew. The little clams stole the show! Then, there was this 'crack yourself' raw egg and the servers were funny by displaying their nonchalance towards customers not in the know what to do! The egg added more aesthetics to the cauldron now looking like fiery volcanic lava! This was the best dish for the evening and one of the best renditions in the city. (5/5)\n\nThen came the disappointment mainly on the value department. The Fried Noodle Soft Tofu ($14.98) was priced the same as the Seafood Stew but all you get were tofu, carrots and onions plus a few mouthfuls of ramen. Although the broth tasted the same as the Seafood Stew, it felt like a rip considering the meager ingredients! If you are into ramen, Marufuku Ramen in Japantown gives you a better bang for your buck and a more substantial bowl of ramen. (2/5)\n\nI love my rice bowl be it Chinese or Japanese! Bibimbab is the classic Korean rice bowl with just as much flavor, texture and color. We ordered the no meat version -the Mushroom and Vegetable Babimbab ($17.98). Rice was served in a stoneware, topped with saut\u00e9ed veggies and 'gochujang' sauce on the side, which was a savory, sweet and spicy condiment for flavor enhancement. Again, there was this raw egg smack dab in the center but this time the yolk brought out the sunshine look! It was a pretty presentation, good tasting but certainly not mind blowing.  For a vegetarian bowl, I felt the price was up in the clouds as well! (3/5)\n\nService was efficient as they were staffed with energetic young boys! There wasn't time for friendly banters as the place was jammed a half-hour after they opened! The d\u00e9cor was elegantly appointed Japanese style with an emphasis on wood.

They offered a limited selection of Korean comfort dishes that we have all come to love  - Tofu Stews, Bibimbab, Korean BBQs and savory Pancakes. The menu is small and these traditional favorites made up the entire menu. We ordered the Seafood Tofu Stew, Bibimbab and Fried Noodles Soft Tofu to share. Some entrees were missing the wow factor. One was particularly hearty and outstanding with a good kick. Prices of some were steep for what you get. I was taken aback by the sky-high price tags on the Pancakes and BBQs. Lightheartedly, we needed to save face and not behave like el cheapos by leaving! So we did the right thing but skipped the pancakes and BBQs!\n \nHowever, where Tofu House surpassed others was in their banchan. Every dish of banchan from the proverbial kimchee to the fish cakes, daikon, cucumbers and bean sprouts were garlicky, deliciously marinated and seasoned with authentic Korean spices. The standout was not kimchee but the small fried yellow croaker fish. They were nicely salted with delicate mild flavors.\n\nThe Seafood Soft Tofu ($14.98) was served in a steaming cauldron of soft tofu stew. The stew was teeming with clams but they skimped on other ingredients. There were a few small shrimps with heads and shells and one piece (yes, one piece) of oyster. Nonetheless, I have to admit the stew tasted phenomenal albeit a little briny, which was expected being a seafood stew. The little clams stole the show! Then, there was this 'crack yourself' raw egg and the servers were funny by displaying their nonchalance towards customers not in the know what to do! The egg added more aesthetics to the cauldron now looking like fiery volcanic lava! This was the best dish for the evening and one of the best renditions in the city. (5/5)\n\nThen came the disappointment mainly on the value department. The Fried Noodle Soft Tofu ($14.98) was priced the same as the Seafood Stew but all you get were tofu, carrots and onions plus a few mouthfuls of ramen. Although the broth tasted the same as the Seafood Stew, it felt like a rip considering the meager ingredients! If you are into ramen, Marufuku Ramen in Japantown gives you a better bang for your buck and a more substantial bowl of ramen. (2/5)\n\nI love my rice bowl be it Chinese or Japanese! Bibimbab is the classic Korean rice bowl with just as much flavor, texture and color. We ordered the no meat version -the Mushroom and Vegetable Babimbab ($17.98). Rice was served in a stoneware, topped with saut\u00e9ed veggies and 'gochujang' sauce on the side, which was a savory, sweet and spicy condiment for flavor enhancement. Again, there was this raw egg smack dab in the center but this time the yolk brought out the sunshine look! It was a pretty presentation, good tasting but certainly not mind blowing.  For a vegetarian bowl, I felt the price was up in the clouds as well! (3/5)\n\nService was efficient as they were staffed with energetic young boys! There wasn't time for friendly banters as the place was jammed a half-hour after they opened! The d\u00e9cor was elegantly appointed Japanese style with an emphasis on wood.

We did, however, go for the a BBQ dish and two bibimbab dinner plates.\n\nI'd have to say first that My Tofu House is a bit more expensive than your average Korean restaurant (which is already a little more than your standard eatery). So expect to pay around $20 per person at around dinner time. Lunch prices are more moderate, however.\n\nI had a craving for some BBQ so I chose to order the Kal Bi, a Korean short rib dish (on bone, of course). It was probably the most expensive item on the menu at $27, but YOLO I guess! The meat was very delicious with a pretty generous portion on short ribs on a bed of cooked onions. I really enjoyed the dish, but sadly when you order this... it's all you get aside from the appetizers and a bowl of rice. It's a meat lovers go-to for sure though.\n\nWe were celebrating my moms birthday and she had the pork bibimbab. My wife went with the beef variation. The dishes were pretty similar and came packed with rice, veggies, and other fixin's. These dishes also had a little bit of heat to them... but not too much. If you like it hot, these wouldn't do it for you, but they were perfect for my mom and wife.\n\nI think to really give this restaurant a fair shake, the next time I come I'll have to go for one of the tofu soups. I mean... why go to tofu house if not to get some tofu?\n\nOverall Tofu House is a solid Korean restaurant that sits a little on the more expensive side of things.

Make sure you cool your plate first.... i know i know....seeing it and trying it right away can be really exciting... but it can be too hot that it burns your tongue...and when it does, you miss out on the good flavorful stuff in the plate. So...adore it for maybe at least 5 minutes, mixing everything before taking your first bite.\n\nThe order of Kalbi is droolingly yummy!!! one order is probably enough for 2 people. or could be for 3, if there's another entree. It's really tasty!!! But you've gotta be ready to go down and dirty with the bones.\nthat's where all the flavor is at.\n\nOne of our friends ordered the Dumpling Soft Tofu. It's really good as well... Good thing she has a really small appetite so all of us took her leftovers. lol.\n\nThe service is great.

Actually, mama always knows best... sorry, dads. She picked this spot for the \"heat\" and knowing parking wouldn't be too bad (as long as you get there before 6:30 pm). One of the most common complaints in eating Korean cuisine is that you go home selling like dinner. Not here, since all of the cooking is done in the kitchen. Here's what we ordered for a party of four: \n\nOriginal Tofu with chicken (not spicy - dad's choice) - Bubbling hot crock filled with soft tofu, chicken chunks, mushrooms, and seaweed... add a raw egg and watch it cook. Think chicken broth soup with the above. \n\nCombination Tofu (mild - didn't want to go overboard) - Bubbling hot crock with soft tofu, two or three prawns, beef, mushrooms, clams, and seaweed... again adding a raw egg. This had a subtle kick and, like the above, is great with rice. \n\nKalbi - Hot platter of marinated short ribs on a bed of onions that grill as it sits on the hot plate. Hearty plate for the meat lover (my brother). Nice flavor and great with rice. \n\nDak Gui - Hot platter of marinated boneless, lean chicken meat on a bed of onions. Nice flavor again and... I'm beginning to see a pattern, great with rice. \n\nBanchan - We were given six different appetizers consisting of Kim Cheer, spicy radish, marinated bean sprouts, marinated cucumbers, marinated little silver fishes (not the bugs), and grilled king fish. I'm not big on the fishy ones, but my parents made up for me. \n\nRice - Served in a black iron pot, topped with peas and ginkgo nuts. After they empty the pot, they add tea into the pot to soften the crusty bottom which are nice for second servings. \n\nTofu Salad - Four firm tofu cakes are served on a bed of iceberg lettuce, julienne carrots, sliced mushrooms, and corn niblets in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. \n\nI like this meal for its variety of flavors, from sour to sweet to savory to spicy. We arrived shortly after 6 pm and were fortunate to be seated in an extra dining area closer to the kitchen, as the line grew. Be sure to put your names and party # on their waiting list.

The standout was not kimchee but the small fried yellow croaker fish. They were nicely salted with delicate mild flavors.\n\nThe Seafood Soft Tofu ($14.98) was served in a steaming cauldron of soft tofu stew. The stew was teeming with clams but they skimped on other ingredients. There were a few small shrimps with heads and shells and one piece (yes, one piece) of oyster. Nonetheless, I have to admit the stew tasted phenomenal albeit a little briny, which was expected being a seafood stew. The little clams stole the show! Then, there was this 'crack yourself' raw egg and the servers were funny by displaying their nonchalance towards customers not in the know what to do! The egg added more aesthetics to the cauldron now looking like fiery volcanic lava! This was the best dish for the evening and one of the best renditions in the city.

The Fried Noodle Soft Tofu ($14.98) was priced the same as the Seafood Stew but all you get were tofu, carrots and onions plus a few mouthfuls of ramen. Although the broth tasted the same as the Seafood Stew, it felt like a rip considering the meager ingredients! If you are into ramen, Marufuku Ramen in Japantown gives you a better bang for your buck and a more substantial bowl of ramen. (2/5)\n\nI love my rice bowl be it Chinese or Japanese! Bibimbab is the classic Korean rice bowl with just as much flavor, texture and color. We ordered the no meat version -the Mushroom and Vegetable Babimbab ($17.98). Rice was served in a stoneware, topped with saut\u00e9ed veggies and 'gochujang' sauce on the side, which was a savory, sweet and spicy condiment for flavor enhancement. Again, there was this raw egg smack dab in the center but this time the yolk brought out the sunshine look! It was a pretty presentation, good tasting but certainly not mind blowing.  For a vegetarian bowl, I felt the price was up in the clouds as well! (3/5)\n\nService was efficient as they were staffed with energetic young boys!

Their pancake was almost like a deep dish pizza with how thick it was. Since it wasn't a thin pizza, it wasn't crispy all the way through and had a doughy center with the seafood ingredients. I didn't particularly like it since I like my pancakes thin. \n\nPrice-wise, it's more expensive than average and it can probably end up being $15-20 per person. Although their menu offers bulgogi and bibimbap as well, I would only come here solely just for soft tofu. After all, that's what they are named and known for.

Waiting time can be anywhere from 10-15 minutes. The interior design gave us a sense that we were eating in our own home. There is a roof over the top and ledges that separates one table from another to give a sense of privacy. Our table felt homey and cozy. \n\nThe service is swift with refilling your barley tea.

I usually choose mild, because even 'mild' at most Korean restaurants is pretty spicy to me, but here 'medium' is much more suitable for me.\n\nAll the tofu soups are around $12. Not a bad price, but not so cheap anymore. But hey, there's always banchan. Here they serve bean sprouts, seasoned cucumber, kimchi, fried tofu skin, spicy winter melon, fried fish, and raw eggs to crack into your soup.

The silky tofu falls apart and absorbs the flavors of the soup. \n\nI've tried the...\nOriginal - w/ mushrooms, beef or pork or chicken:\nI'd say choose beef if you're picking a protein, because it gives the soup the most flavor. \n\nSeafood - w/ oyster, shrimp & clam:\nThe seafood is not great. The shrimp are tiny and difficult to eat, and the rest of the shellfish get lost in the soup.\n\nKimchi - w/ kimchi, mushrooms, beef or pork:\nThe kimchi loses its distinguishing kimchi traits as the seasoning washes off the cabbage leaves and seep directly into the soup.\n\nDumpling - w/ dumpling, rice cake, beef\nMy favorite of the bunch, because it's very filling. The dumplings are not bad, pretty meaty and the skin is very soft. Sometimes I dip a spoonful of rice into the soup to give it flavor, but I usually can't finish the rice after I eat all the dumplings.\n\nIf you are interested in trying one of the BBQ dishes, come for lunch, because the dinner price is nearly double the cost, and I don't really think it's worth it.\n\nService is very good. I respect all the servers carrying around piping hot dishes and carrying out all those tiny banchan plates.\n\nSometimes there is a wait for the dinner crowd. I'm a little surprised.

The waitress came out with our orders switched resulting in his granny having the medium spice tofu soup where she can't handle. I kindly asked her to change it because she clearly messed up the order but she being really rude about it. She kept looking back at her notepad trying to claim that it was ordered correctly and making the situation harder and more complicated than it needed to be. All I asked for was to have the tofu soup remade to mild and I even kept my mild tofu soup so it would be less trouble for her. Eventually, she took it back to have it remade but didn't come out with the new one till end of dinner when his granny was already full from eating off of our other dishes. \n\nOverall, food is decent for what it is but for the price, it's def more on the pricey side for the usual Korean dishes.

As we all know, the Richmond tends to be cold and damp at this time of the year.  So the location at Geary and 10th Avenue in the heart of the district is ideal.  As a kind of Asian warming hut, it's top notch.  At $11.50 for a hot bubbling bowl of tofu soup, tea, tons of rice, a fried fish, and a bunch of little appetizer plates typical of Korean cuisine, it's affordability is hard to beat.  It's truly an excellent deal.\n\nIf you're like me and dislike waiting, I advise an earlier 6-6:30pm arrival time.  I arrived at about 6:45pm last night, and I waited about 10 minutes.  There are plenty of tables, but crowds do descend at peak times and a line does form quickly then.   This is not a fast food spot, so expect to wait a bit because they do get busy.  But you won't be waiting forever.  Their menu is relatively simple, and they've thus got the service system down well.  After setting down tea, I ordered the Combo Tofu soup:  tofu with beef, shrimp, and clams. \n\nThe small plates are a treat.  If you're hungry and your chopsticks are poised, you'll tuck into these as soon as they appear.  There are meat strips, cucumber, daikon, sprouts, kim chi (naturally), a raw egg (for the soup), firm tofu, and a small fried fish.  Most of these items come dressed in Korean spices.  You have to like Korean flavoring, in other words, if you want to hang at My Tofu House. It's all Korean, all the time.   It's all good for you, and high in vitamin C.\n\nThe soup arrived boiling in a clay pot.  Take caution, the pot is burning hot and is no joke.  The soup is very hot, too, so save your tongue and let it cool, but not too long.  It's best eaten hot.  You'll find loads of tofu in the soup, with ample pieces of shrimp and clams.  I could have used more beef, so if you want a lot of beef, order the Beef tofu soup.  It felt so good to eat- so warming, so comforting.  I was trying to fend off a cold I felt coming on, so it did me good.  I felt my sinuses clearing any my body warming quickly with each spoonful of piping hot soup.\n\nRice is de rigeur in Asian spots, and they give you a ton at My Tofu House.  The server leaves the hot rice pot at the table for you.  Once all of the rice has been scooped into your silver metal bowl, he slowly pours hot rice broth into the empty rice pot.  The toasted browned rice stuck to the sides of the pot soak into the broth, producing a warm rice soup that is enjoyed at meal's end.  All very good.  \n\nOn the whole, My Tofu House is very representative of affordable Asian fare in SF.  It's affordable, authentic, no nonsense, and efficient.  That is to say, hole in the wall prices but authentic, delicious food.

That means you better get going and crack that egg kuz it doesn't leave much time for the egg to cook.  The soondobu was...kinda bland, but it was thick and full of tofu (so that wasn't too bad).  The Pajeon was bland too, you really needed the soy dipping sauce.  I found the pancake to be a bit too doughy.  I've had better where it was just full of seafood and veggies in a light batter.

One of the most common complaints in eating Korean cuisine is that you go home selling like dinner. Not here, since all of the cooking is done in the kitchen. Here's what we ordered for a party of four: \n\nOriginal Tofu with chicken (not spicy - dad's choice) - Bubbling hot crock filled with soft tofu, chicken chunks, mushrooms, and seaweed... add a raw egg and watch it cook. Think chicken broth soup with the above. \n\nCombination Tofu (mild - didn't want to go overboard) - Bubbling hot crock with soft tofu, two or three prawns, beef, mushrooms, clams, and seaweed... again adding a raw egg. This had a subtle kick and, like the above, is great with rice. \n\nKalbi - Hot platter of marinated short ribs on a bed of onions that grill as it sits on the hot plate. Hearty plate for the meat lover (my brother). Nice flavor and great with rice. \n\nDak Gui - Hot platter of marinated boneless, lean chicken meat on a bed of onions. Nice flavor again and... I'm beginning to see a pattern, great with rice. \n\nBanchan - We were given six different appetizers consisting of Kim Cheer, spicy radish, marinated bean sprouts, marinated cucumbers, marinated little silver fishes (not the bugs), and grilled king fish. I'm not big on the fishy ones, but my parents made up for me. \n\nRice - Served in a black iron pot, topped with peas and ginkgo nuts. After they empty the pot, they add tea into the pot to soften the crusty bottom which are nice for second servings. \n\nTofu Salad - Four firm tofu cakes are served on a bed of iceberg lettuce, julienne carrots, sliced mushrooms, and corn niblets in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. \n\nI like this meal for its variety of flavors, from sour to sweet to savory to spicy. We arrived shortly after 6 pm and were fortunate to be seated in an extra dining area closer to the kitchen, as the line grew. Be sure to put your names and party # on their waiting list. The service is very homey and nice as there are basically three people working the floor (orders, serving, and busing). It was nice that a waiter remembered us and served the tofu salad as a bonus to our meal (we didn't order it). By the time we left at 7:30 pm, the line was out the door. They are definitely doing something right and it's certainly not a secret.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-04-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Looking at the menu, the food was a bit pricey, but figured the quality of food would make up for it.

Either way, make sure that they make you rice toast soup! They'll pour tea into the hot stone rice pot, which will lift the crusty, toasty rice off of the surface. Let it sit and thicken just a bit and you'll get rice toast soup.

A friend had suggested going for dinner after a long day walking around in windy and chilly SF. I was definitely looking forward to wolfing down some sizzling/boiling food to warm myself up. \n\nFirst off, we had a VERY difficult time finding parking. It was a late Saturday evening and we were circling the area for what seemed like an eternity, looking for parking. No dice. Meanwhile, I was impatiently salivating at the promise of being served hot delicious morsels of food. Finally we found a spot a few blocks away a good 20 mins or more later. We ran towards the restaurant to get out of the cold wind.\n\nWhen we got there, the very narrow hallway in front of the door was  jam packed with many bodies waiting to be seated. I pushed through to get to the waiting list only to have this chick rudely swoop in to grab the pen just as I was reaching for it. She pens her name down and I follow suit  - there are at least 8 names on the list before us. I attempted to find a tiny niche to stand and wait, only to be told to move back by an employee, to give patrons more privacy as the waiting area immediately spilled into the diner's booths/tables. I will count their concern for diners as a plus. An hour later we are finally called to be seated and I immediately inform the server that we had already decided our order.\n\nHot tea is brought out in \"clear\" plastic short tumblers that looks suspiciously too light to be tea. I take and sip and yes, it tastes like hot water, not tea. But hey, at least it was free. Our order is taken and my friend and I order the same thing - the #3 seafood tofu, mine mild and hers spicy (fyi, there are 4 levels: not spicy, mild, medium, spicy). I can't tolerate spice well and since I was at what appeared to be an authentic Korean restaurant I decided to play it safe. The side dishes come out soon after we order and I have to admit that they were the highlight of the meal. The kimchi was perfect, quite spicy but in a deliciously tolerable way. I love anything pickled and salted so the anchovies, bean sprouts, cucumbers, radish and salted/fried fish were all good. Our tofu dishes come out still sizzling hot and I'm staring in anticipation as they're put down. I crack the egg over and start looking for the oysters only to realize they put in the wrong order because there's beef in it. Ugh. Disappointing. But I decided to keep eating anyway. I dig in and the tofu soup is NOT spicy at ALL, neither is it as flavorful as I had expected. I try my friend's spicy dish to compare and found barely any heat to it. Disappointing again. There was barely any meat, mostly tofu and I had expected more for the price of $10.05, but then again I guess it's SF. Meanwhile, rice topped with green peas and chick peas is brought out in a stone pot and scooped out for us. Hot water was then poured over the rice stuck to the bottom so we could enjoy the slightly burned rice. \n\nTo sum up, service was prompt but they messed up on our 2 simple orders. I can let that slide since it was obviously a busy night, but then again, I figure it's not the first busy night they've had. Food was way overpriced and I saw that the meat dishes were priced in the almost $20 zone which deterred me, but thankfully I just wanted something soupy.

My friend's Korean friend recommended a place there, which I believe was a mini-chain, and the tofu really didn't seem soft and silky. The broth also wasn't as good as My Tofu House's. Needless to say, I was really sad and was crying inside for My Tofu House in SF. :( \n\nI'm not really sure why some Yelpers are complaining that the portions here are small - I think that the servings for bulgogi and soon dubu are pretty normal for a Korean restaurant.

With \"Tofu\" in it's name, this place sure knows how to make their signature item perfect. The tofu is so silky smooth, and the ingrediants compliments it to the tee. The soup is served on a boiling iron bowl, so it stays nice and warm throughout the dinner. The BBQ items are great too, you must try the ribs.\n\nThe Korean numerous side dishes \"were\" awesome, they have now reduced the number of side items for each table. BOO! It used to be 10+ items on the table, now it's half that. \n\nThe price is decent. The soup was $8.45 and ribs were $15(or so). But now the prices have gone up. Another Boo!
