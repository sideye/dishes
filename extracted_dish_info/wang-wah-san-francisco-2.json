It was really easy to call in the day before, and they can work with you on the amount of food. When they say enough for one person, they make the assumption that's all their eating. So if you order noodles for 15 people, you're literally getting enough noodles to fill 15 people up. \n\nI worked with them to make vegan noodles (rice noodle chow mien with no egg), as we had a vegan attending. It was cooked pretty well, and was very filling. \n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken wings: they're really good, but you need to eat them fast. Or maybe I needed to open the tin foil so it didn't steam. The fry is a little more like a thick batter (think beer batter). The chili peppers were delicious.\n\nMixed Veggies: I did say we had a vegan, right? They were really nice at figuring out how to make this one more substantial, and ended up adding tofu in the mix.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty easy process. We had a ton of leftovers, though people were happy to take the rest. It's one of the best Chinese food spots on the Ocean Avenue corridor. \n\n\nAgain, might be bias because I spoke to the owner in Chinese, and she kind of knew who I was because of her children. But.
