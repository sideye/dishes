"], "author": "Vay V.", "review": "The food was better than I expected for being in a semi-tourist area. I wanted to give it a try being that I live around the corner. It is in the range of a 3-4 star but the service was a little slow. I ordered for pickup, they told me it would take 10 minutes, but I waited over 30 minutes for my order of three items. The place itself was not busy with active patrons, but they were super busy with online orders for both delivery and pickup. I ordered the following dishes:\n\nGarlic Shrimp\nSesame crispy beef\nKung Po Tofu\n\nThe garlic shrimp was well cooked and flavorful, but it was a little disappointing in size as well as how it was prepared. I love the silvers of garlic found in the dish that gave it a more pungent garlic taste. My togo box was only half filled. The broccoli that it came with was steamed and the shrimp was sitting on top of it. The broccoli would had been better if it was saut\u00e9ed with the shrimp to gain some flavor. The flavor profile of the steamed broccoli and saut\u00e9ed garlic shrimp didn't quite match. For the price, I would had expected a larger portion.\n\nThe sesame crispy beef was recommended. It was savory, but had a familiar taste of orange beef but not as spicy and pungent. I was both disappointed but surprised, I was disappointed because I could had just order orange chicken instead and I was also disappointed because it wasn't crispy, as the name suggested. \n\nThe kung po tofu wasnt as spicy as other kung pos I have had elsewhere. The tofu was pre-fried before cooking with the other ingredients. The tofu was over-fried giving it a more chewy and tough texture. I would had liked it lightly friend for some texture, still giving it some firmness on the outside with a night crisp but keeping it soft on the inside.\n\nOverall the place was better than mediocre but below fantastic. The portions are a little smaller than Chinatown and what I am used to getting living on the East Coast, Midwest and Sacramento. I would try this place again especially to get my Chinese food fix.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-09-06"}, {"excerpts": ["The pot stickers were good and the garlic shrimp was wonderful.

Casual attire for dining in this minimally decorated storefront restaurant.  The restaurant is ok for group dining sizes from single diners to modest family numbers, but could not handle larger group numbers.  Dining with children is ok.\n\nFood: A terrific variety of typical Hunan/Szechuan/Cantonese dishes will certainly satisfy most everybody's taste.  The Hot and Sour soup was exceptionally well prepared.  Same for dim sum appetizers.  House duck in brown sauce was perfectly crispy.  Lemon Chicken was crispy and very lemony!  Food portions were satisfactory.  Dinner with soup, appetizers, and entrees with rice, but without alcohol will average $20/person.\n\nBeverages:  The restaurant appears to be licensed for beer/wine and has an adequate selection of all the customary beers and soft drinks.\n\nService:  Servers were quiet, polite, and appropriately attentive.\n\nIf you're near Union Square and want excellent Chinese food fast and without the hike over the hill into Chinatown, you can dine in, take out, or call for delivery from these guys.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-07-19"}], "seafood delight szechuan style": [], "garlic shrimp sauteed with slow toast garlic": [], "kun pao three ingredient": [], "hunan general tsuos chicken lunch special": [], "szechuan chicken with fresh veggie lunch special": [], "szechuan crispy sesame beef lunch special": [], "chicken with black bean sauce lunch special": [], "beef with black bean sauce lunch special": [], "green bean chicken lunch special": [], "green bean beef lunch special": [], "hunan spicy sauce beef lunch special": [], "bean sauce chicken lunch special": [], "szechuan kung pao prawns lunch special": [], "prawns with green bean lunch special": [], "hunan spicy sauce prawns lunch special": [], "cashew prawns lunch special": [], "fish black bean sauce lunch special": [], "broccoli with mushroom lunch special": []}
