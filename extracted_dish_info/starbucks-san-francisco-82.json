"], "author": "Elena R.", "review": "This is the worst Starbucks expierence I've ever had at Starbucks. \n\nNo exaggeration, waiting 15 minutes to order on New Year's Day. They had one person at the register who was clearly new because they had to keep asking other staff to help with the register. \n\nI paid for a Protein Box and ordered a Grande Hot Water and a Tall Cinnamon Dolce Latte no whip. I waited another 15 minutes for my name to be called. When it was they gave me a Tall Whole Milk Cinnamon Dolce Latte with whipped cream and no hot water. When I asked for the Hot Water another Barista yelled at me and said I would have to wait until she was done for the row of drinks... for hot water. \n\nI threw my CDL out and wasted that money. Starbucks is typically fairly consistent but this was horrible.", "rating": 1, "date": "2018-01-01"}]}
