Our choices: Taqueria Cancun (the one between 18th and 19th) and Taqueria San Jose. Since I didn't feel like driving through a goddamn hurricane for tacos, we settled on the one that is closest to my house.\n\nI hadn't been back to my stomping grounds for a while (Luna Park definitely does not count), and I quickly saw that it was the same as I had left it. There were roughly 5 or 6 police cars all over this stretch of Mission street, sirens blaring and a mass of cops walking around like one of them had lost their keys. As we crossed the street in the rain, we passed by two police offers, who quickly ran down the situation:\n\nCop 1: \"So we still don't have a victim?\"\nCop 2: \"That's right, Lieutenant.\"\n\nNothing like tacos and random gunfire to welcome you home.\n\nTaqueria San Jose, as you might of guessed, is a 3-star taqueria that doesn't really have anything to write home (or on Yelp) about. The food is a bit greasy, the salsa at the salsa bar is not fresh, and the place is cold as shit. However, sometimes you kind of want that, or dare I say need that. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos with cheese and guacamole, and they were both great. Not taco truck great, not La Taqueria great, but \"it's 11pm and I'm glad I'm eating these tacos instead of gnawing my fucking arm off from hunger\" great. And that's all you can really ask for.\n\nWith so many taquerias in the area, why chose Taqueria San Jose over any other taqueria?

Chips are pretty standard, mass-produced but good.  The salsa bar was good and they have Tapatio on the tables.. nice!\n\nThe burrito was enormous, but not all that great.  I mean, it wasn't bad, the al pastor was decently marinated but doesn't compare to El Farolito across the street.  The rest of the ingredients were pretty standard.\n\nI enjoyed the cantaloupe aguas frescas, but I think the stuff at La Taqueria (also across the street) is better.\n\nOverall, this place is ok, but La Taqueria and El Farolito are better, giving you little to no incentive to eat here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-05-17"}], "strawberry beverage": [], "melon beverage": [], "tamarindo beverage": [], "orange soda": [], "milk": []}
