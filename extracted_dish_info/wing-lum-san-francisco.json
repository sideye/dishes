I know that there are many Chinese restaurants in San Francisco that offer competition. But this establishment gets five stars from me which is significant because I don't pass out five stars generously. But Wing Lum deserves every bit of those five stars.\n    Ok I know there are a lot of good Chinese restaurants out there. But there is usually something I don't like about them. The portions aren't big enough. They won't take the vegetables out of the fried rice(I don't do vegi's). The servers are unfriendly. Too over priced for what you get. Not here at Wing Lum. Everything from the quality and portions of the food served to the service and price is right on the mark with what a good Chinese restaurant should be. \n    Lets focus on the food right now. I'm sorry but nobody does it right like Wing Lum does it. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I do realize that there are a lot of good Chinese restaurants out there. Especially in a city like San Francisco. But no matter where I am at the moment, I will go out of my way to be able to eat at Wing Lum. I recommend their sweet and sour pork. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Not only is it delicious but they give you a lot of it. By the time time you finish you will be full. :-) The great thing is it won't cost you an arm and a leg to get full either. \n    The same waiter always waits on me and my friend every time we go in there.

Not able to finish all the dishes in the dinner we asked if we could box it up to go. Our waiter (I think the owner, as he said he had been there for 14 years) offered to box it up himself and took our dishes to go box them. He returned with one semi-large bag. We thanked him for our time there and went home. The next day when I opened the food bag up for leftovers dinner I found that the majority of our food was missing.\n\nEach of the take-out boxes were filled no more than halfway, when they each should have been overflowing, if not put in multiple boxes. We had barely touched the cashew chicken dish: one bite by each of us.\n\nI called and asked about our predicament. The person on the phone remembered who I was and blamed us for the problem, explaining that we forgot the other food, that he threw it out this morning, and that if we had called earlier he would still have it. I asked how we could have forgotten it when he didn't bring it out to us. He then switched languages on me, and I couldn't understand what was said. To his credit when I told him I didn't understand he switched back to English.\n\nFrom then on, he was very rude and hostile toward me saying over and over again that I had forgotten the food. I kept asking how this was possible as he only brought out one bag for us, and put it directly on the table. Seeing this was going nowhere, I told him to have a nice night and that I am sorry but I cannot return to his dishonest business.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me if there was an extra bag (that he might have left in the back) was that we had four dishes to be boxed up: mongolian beef, cashew chicken, bbq pork fried rice, and won ton soup (he switched the soup in the Szechuan Dinner at the beginning when we ordered, as we asked)\n\nThe bag I received had one box for each of these dishes, but extremely small portions of each inside. If there had been another bag, it makes more sense to me that you would box one dish up at a time. So if a dish took up more than one box, those boxes would be filled before any of the other dishes were boxed up. Then I would put the boxes for one dish in a single bag, and only after running out of space in that bag (weight, volume), then I would get a second bag and put the rest of the dishes in there.\n\nBecause the bag I received had portions of all the dishes in it, it makes more sense to me that our waiter did not even box up the rest and decided not to give us our food. But maybe he just forgot to bring out the other bag.\n\nEither way, he was extremely rude on the phone and dishonest about the situation, blaming me for a mistake he made.

Our waiter (I think the owner, as he said he had been there for 14 years) offered to box it up himself and took our dishes to go box them. He returned with one semi-large bag. We thanked him for our time there and went home. The next day when I opened the food bag up for leftovers dinner I found that the majority of our food was missing.\n\nEach of the take-out boxes were filled no more than halfway, when they each should have been overflowing, if not put in multiple boxes. We had barely touched the cashew chicken dish: one bite by each of us.\n\nI called and asked about our predicament. The person on the phone remembered who I was and blamed us for the problem, explaining that we forgot the other food, that he threw it out this morning, and that if we had called earlier he would still have it. I asked how we could have forgotten it when he didn't bring it out to us. He then switched languages on me, and I couldn't understand what was said. To his credit when I told him I didn't understand he switched back to English.\n\nFrom then on, he was very rude and hostile toward me saying over and over again that I had forgotten the food. I kept asking how this was possible as he only brought out one bag for us, and put it directly on the table. Seeing this was going nowhere, I told him to have a nice night and that I am sorry but I cannot return to his dishonest business.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me if there was an extra bag (that he might have left in the back) was that we had four dishes to be boxed up: mongolian beef, cashew chicken, bbq pork fried rice, and won ton soup (he switched the soup in the Szechuan Dinner at the beginning when we ordered, as we asked)\n\nThe bag I received had one box for each of these dishes, but extremely small portions of each inside. If there had been another bag, it makes more sense to me that you would box one dish up at a time. So if a dish took up more than one box, those boxes would be filled before any of the other dishes were boxed up. Then I would put the boxes for one dish in a single bag, and only after running out of space in that bag (weight, volume), then I would get a second bag and put the rest of the dishes in there.\n\nBecause the bag I received had portions of all the dishes in it, it makes more sense to me that our waiter did not even box up the rest and decided not to give us our food. But maybe he just forgot to bring out the other bag.\n\nEither way, he was extremely rude on the phone and dishonest about the situation, blaming me for a mistake he made.

Not able to finish all the dishes in the dinner we asked if we could box it up to go. Our waiter (I think the owner, as he said he had been there for 14 years) offered to box it up himself and took our dishes to go box them. He returned with one semi-large bag. We thanked him for our time there and went home. The next day when I opened the food bag up for leftovers dinner I found that the majority of our food was missing.\n\nEach of the take-out boxes were filled no more than halfway, when they each should have been overflowing, if not put in multiple boxes. We had barely touched the cashew chicken dish: one bite by each of us.\n\nI called and asked about our predicament. The person on the phone remembered who I was and blamed us for the problem, explaining that we forgot the other food, that he threw it out this morning, and that if we had called earlier he would still have it. I asked how we could have forgotten it when he didn't bring it out to us. He then switched languages on me, and I couldn't understand what was said. To his credit when I told him I didn't understand he switched back to English.\n\nFrom then on, he was very rude and hostile toward me saying over and over again that I had forgotten the food. I kept asking how this was possible as he only brought out one bag for us, and put it directly on the table. Seeing this was going nowhere, I told him to have a nice night and that I am sorry but I cannot return to his dishonest business.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me if there was an extra bag (that he might have left in the back) was that we had four dishes to be boxed up: mongolian beef, cashew chicken, bbq pork fried rice, and won ton soup (he switched the soup in the Szechuan Dinner at the beginning when we ordered, as we asked)\n\nThe bag I received had one box for each of these dishes, but extremely small portions of each inside. If there had been another bag, it makes more sense to me that you would box one dish up at a time. So if a dish took up more than one box, those boxes would be filled before any of the other dishes were boxed up. Then I would put the boxes for one dish in a single bag, and only after running out of space in that bag (weight, volume), then I would get a second bag and put the rest of the dishes in there.\n\nBecause the bag I received had portions of all the dishes in it, it makes more sense to me that our waiter did not even box up the rest and decided not to give us our food. But maybe he just forgot to bring out the other bag.\n\nEither way, he was extremely rude on the phone and dishonest about the situation, blaming me for a mistake he made.

Get back in the car and drive all the way back home. Set up the table, turn on the TV and finally open the box... and what do i find????? A COLD SOUP WITH WHITE STEAMED NASTY RICE!!!! WTF???? They totally messed up my order!\n\nI called back immediately very pissed at this point, the guy who answered said they could not refund me, and not only that but it was also too late for them to cook my CORRECT food again??? No further compensation other than come back here and we \"may\" give you half off and NO apology... WHAT!\n\nThey are BY FAR THE WORST RESTAURANT, with awful food (I took a sip of that soup and it gave me the runs the next day) and WITH THE WORST AND LOWEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE CITY!\n\nSTAY AWAY!", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-02-23"}], "bbq pork fried rice": [{"excerpts": ["The BBQ pork fried rice is decent but after the chicken I questioned the state of the pork.

Not able to finish all the dishes in the dinner we asked if we could box it up to go. Our waiter (I think the owner, as he said he had been there for 14 years) offered to box it up himself and took our dishes to go box them. He returned with one semi-large bag. We thanked him for our time there and went home. The next day when I opened the food bag up for leftovers dinner I found that the majority of our food was missing.\n\nEach of the take-out boxes were filled no more than halfway, when they each should have been overflowing, if not put in multiple boxes. We had barely touched the cashew chicken dish: one bite by each of us.\n\nI called and asked about our predicament. The person on the phone remembered who I was and blamed us for the problem, explaining that we forgot the other food, that he threw it out this morning, and that if we had called earlier he would still have it. I asked how we could have forgotten it when he didn't bring it out to us. He then switched languages on me, and I couldn't understand what was said. To his credit when I told him I didn't understand he switched back to English.\n\nFrom then on, he was very rude and hostile toward me saying over and over again that I had forgotten the food. I kept asking how this was possible as he only brought out one bag for us, and put it directly on the table. Seeing this was going nowhere, I told him to have a nice night and that I am sorry but I cannot return to his dishonest business.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me if there was an extra bag (that he might have left in the back) was that we had four dishes to be boxed up: mongolian beef, cashew chicken, bbq pork fried rice, and won ton soup (he switched the soup in the Szechuan Dinner at the beginning when we ordered, as we asked)\n\nThe bag I received had one box for each of these dishes, but extremely small portions of each inside. If there had been another bag, it makes more sense to me that you would box one dish up at a time. So if a dish took up more than one box, those boxes would be filled before any of the other dishes were boxed up. Then I would put the boxes for one dish in a single bag, and only after running out of space in that bag (weight, volume), then I would get a second bag and put the rest of the dishes in there.\n\nBecause the bag I received had portions of all the dishes in it, it makes more sense to me that our waiter did not even box up the rest and decided not to give us our food. But maybe he just forgot to bring out the other bag.\n\nEither way, he was extremely rude on the phone and dishonest about the situation, blaming me for a mistake he made. I will not be returning here, despite the comfortable aroma and pretty good food. There are plenty of other Chinese food restaurants in the area.", "rating": 1, "date": "2011-12-12"}, {"excerpts": ["didn't get anything exciting, stuck to the (white girl eating chinese) classics: sweet and sour chicken, beef with snow peas, bbq pork fried rice and vegetable chow mein.
