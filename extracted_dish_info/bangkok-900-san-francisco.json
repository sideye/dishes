I came away from this place with few fond, lingering memories, but there were two:\n\nFirst, unfortunately, is the bad memory: it seemed a wee bit expensive for where it's located on its lonely corner and with minimal atmosphere.\n\nBut, the good memory:  Mussamun Beef Curry!  I first had this dish in LA (the capital of Thai food in the U.S.) and it was amazing -- essentially, it's beef stew, Thai style, with potatoes and peanuts.  The traditional way is using cubes of beef that melt in your mouth and are easily cut with a fork, same as in good American beef stew.\n\nThe majority of Thai restaurants I've been to in SF don't even have the item on the menu, and I've subsequently found out that it's a very regional dish.  But of the ones that do have it on the menu, they use sliced beef which, if I haven't been led down the wrong road, is simply not the way it's supposed to be made, and I can certainly tell you that the dish is not very special without the cubed beef.\n\nSo this restaurant is the first one I've been to here that not only carries it, but generally makes it the right way.\n\nNow, that said (and the reason I say \"generally\" above)...\n\nSomeone else here mentioned that they had a curry dish there and there was a big glob of oil in  with the sauce, as if it hadn't been mixed properly (or shouldn't have been in there in the first place).  I'm afraid that that is the case with the mussamun too.  I did my best to leave the oil in the serving dish while carefully spooning out the best of the sauce.\n\nOk, yeah, I know, why bother.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-05-02"}, {"excerpts": ["I always get pad thai, chicken sate, chicken curry, gai kow prow, and sometimes spring rolls with rice.  \n\n"], "author": "Matt B.", "review": "I have been eating here for 10 years.

The thing is it took us years to realize how great it is, because it always looks so vacant inside that I thought that might bode ill for the food.  Well, they do a thriving take-out business, so it's not like people are avoiding them.  Finally I realized, that with 3 kids, the lack of people in the dining room suited our needs perfectly.  That's when I realized the gem I'd been missing out on.  It's  now my kids' favorite place.  The gentleman who runs the place quickly got to know who we were when we started coming back again and again, and gives us excellent, good-humored service--even has our order memorized.  In addition to the chicken sates the kids devour, my husband and I always get the calamari salad, and they serve a beef dish with the most amazing dipping sauce for the steamed vegetables, ever.  It was so good the next time I came back my whole order was  vegetable plate with that sauce and I'm not the biggest fan of vegetables. (I wish I knew what it was called to recommend it.)
