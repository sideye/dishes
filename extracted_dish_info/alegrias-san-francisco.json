The service is both kind and attentive - I remember calling up twice and asking for reservations to which they politely complied to, as well as our waiters being very personable during our meals.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant romanticizes the experience, or at least gives a solid enough a backdrop for my nostalgia--it's ideal for a mellow romantic date, and even if the person you're out with decides that they want to eat at the (admittedly inexpensive) Chinese restaurant in Chinatown immediately after, you'll still come out smiling.\n\nI'm not particularly versed with their selection of wines, but their Sangria is tasty (unfortunately I haven't been there in a while so I cannot comment on this further). The one drawback that I find from the entire experience is the price relative to how much food you get. Don't get me wrong: the food is great, but you don't get as much as you would hope to in other restaurants. Appetizers are normally around $7.00 to $9.00, and the main dishes go to about $20 per plate. I'm not saying it's not worth it: I'm just saying that it's not wise to go here and expect it to be a cheap hangout (but maybe that's because I'm a student, I don't know). My suggestion is to sample as much of their tapas as you can, and order one paella dish (Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol) if you want variety in your meals.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Alegrias, you'll find the experience to be pleasant. I would recommend trying the following:\n1. Patatas Alioli - it's basically fried potatos bits drizzled in Alioli, but it's still very good. \n2. Cazuela de Caracoles y Almejas -  Snails and Manila clams stewed in red sauce\n3. Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos con Cordero - it's like an Indian samosa with pimiento peppers as the wrap; succulent and one of the few dishes that I find well worth its price.\n4. Croquetas del dia - one time it was ham; the other time it was chicken. Both were great.\n5. Tabla de Quesos y Chorizos Espa\u00f1oles - it's basically a sampling of cheese and sausage from Spain. Take it with wine.\n6. Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol - this is, I think, my favorite paella out of the four available.

"], "author": "Jessie L.", "review": "TLDR - Solid Spanish tapas but the dishes lacked a wow factor in comparison to other tapas restaurants in SF\n\nI've basically been slowly going around SF looking for the best Spanish tapas restaurant. Alegrias is a pretty small one sort of hidden away in the Marina. Compared to the other places I've been to, it's definitely on the homier side and it feels very family run. The restaurant is rather cramped inside and has more of a casual, intimate feel. It seems to get busy on the weekend, so make a reservation in advance if you can. \n\nThe menu has a variety of hot tapas, a few cold ones and paella, and there's a solid wine menu as well. The paellas take about 30 minutes, but they time everything pretty well so that there isn't a long wait in between dishes. For 4 people, we ordered 5 tapas, 1 paella and 1 pitcher of sangria for about $130 after tax/tip.\n\nThe dishes and menu offering felt more traditional with none of that flair you sometimes get at more trendy restaurants. The food was pretty good but as a whole, I wasn't wowed. Definitely recommend the Croquetas and Empanadillas though.\n\n* SANGRIA ($26 for pitcher)\nOne pitcher's maybe good for 6 of their glasses (which were on the smaller side for wine glasses). \n\n* EMPANADILLAS DE CARNE ($8.50) - 4.5/5\n[beef, green onions, olives, raisins, herbs]\nComes with only 2 empanadillas, each of which are maybe 2 bites. They're really good though so I'd recommend ordering enough to have your own. The beef filling was sweet and delicious and the outside was crisp without being greasy.\n\n* CROQUETAS DE JAMON IBERICO Y GAMBA ($9.50) - 5/5\n[croquettes filled w/ minced jamon iberico & prawn]\nProbably the best thing we ordered! This one comes with 4 croquetas, each of which was delicately fried on the outside and filled with creamy goodness on the inside.\n\n* ESPINACAS A LA CATALANA ($8.50) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed spinach, garlic, raisins, apple, pine nuts]\nI'm convinced I should be sauteeing my spinach with raisins and apples now to add some sweetness. I was disappointed at how small the portion size was though.. Not really worth ordering in comparison to other dishes.\n\n* PATATAS AIOLI ($8) - 3.5/5\n[crisp fried potatoes, traditional aioli sauce]\nIf you love potatoes, you'll probably like these more than I did. They had a decent crisp to them, but otherwise I found them pretty average. I've had Spanish patatas at other places paired with a tastier sauce. The portion size was big and filling though.\n\n* CONEJO A LA CAZUELA ($13) - 4/5\n[stewed rabbit w/ vegetables & wine]\nThere were only 3 pieces of meat so the dish was disappointing for the price. The tomato broth was tasty but also simple, nothing super special in flavor.\n\n* PAELLA A LA VALENCIANA CON CHORIZO ESPANOL ($29) - 3/5\n[saffron flavored spanish rice, chicken, seafood, chorizo]\nOne of the more disappointing paellas I've had. The chicken was well cooked and the chorizo was tasty, but the seafood was a little overcooked and the rice lacked flavor and fragrance.

I called them to inquire, and the lady who picked up my call was so nice as to prepare our table as we were walking there (it took about 10 minutes for our large group to leisurely saunter over).\n\nMy first impression of the restaurant when I first walked in was that it was very intimate and romantic. The inside is dimly lit and has a cozy feel to it. Most of the tables were occupied by couples young and old going for a Saturday night dinner date. We were seated in the back area where they had prepared our table, and it felt even more romantic in there because they had these strings of yellow lights strung up along the walls.\n\nFor 9 people, we ordered 3 paellas (each paella serves around 2) and 14 tapas dishes and that was a good amount of food.\n\nFor me the highlights of the meal were:\n\nArroz negro (paella): liked the squid ink paella a lot more than the other two paellas we got. The flavor was more subtle than the seafood paella but it still had really good flavor.\n\nEmpanadillas de carne: these small empanadas were served piping hot. The filling was very tasty and full of yummy meat juices.\n\nTortilla de chorizo: a potato omelette with onions and chorizo.

We arrived very early, however, the owner agreed to seat us which was really nice.  We were shown to a table way in the back of the rear room (the front room looked more atmospheric).  And there was a huge group that was seated right next to that table then another large table in the back of it.  Needless to say it looked claustrophobic so we asked to be moved which the owner graciously accommodated.  We were so glad we made this decision as the table seated next to the original table we were shown to was filled with a few very extremely stupidly loud men who were obviously drunk.  The noise they created was a total annoyance to not only us but to the other diners who were looking at them.  Thus, one could barely speak to one's dining companions without shouting due to these moronic, conscienceless drunks.  When they finally left after two hours later it was a total relief.\n\nThe food was quite good especially the paella (we ordered the paella a la Valenciana and the paella a la marinera).  We began with three tapas:  Empanadillas de carne, mejilones (mussels), and gambas al ajillo (prawns in garlic sauce).  The mussels were very large and plump/juicy, and the accompanying dish to put the shells could barely fit them all as it was too small; would have been better to have provided a larger dish for the shells.  Shrimp were not that many just a few in a partially spicy garlicky sauce, but the garlic could have been more as it was a bit weak tasting to me. The paellas are in smallish pans than what we're used to in Spain and in the UK.  It can only feed two people at most.

The portion was more than what we'd ordered at Los Galayos in Madrid so we were pleased. Owner's husband (I think) came around to encourage my husband to take more of the crisped rice that was at the bottom of the pan.  Some restaurants really burn the rice too much for my liking; Alegrias just did it enough.\n\nDesserts we ordered were the arroz con leche & flan; both were a nice end to a lovely meal.  We also ordered cortados which were nicer than the usual espresso since there was a layer of frothy milk on the top.\n\nWe had a simple Spanish white wine with dinner-a Muscadet.  A bit sweet but it accompanied the meal well anyhow.\n\nThe only negatives were small.  First was being shown to that awful table way in the back of the rear room and next to a bunch of loutish types.  We made a reservation two days prior so it was a bit surprising to be shown to such a poor location.  Secondly the service was erratic perhaps because the owner mentioned and apologized that staff called in sick.  However, our waiter came timely to take our order & give us our bill.  Otherwise, it was a different waiter (or waiters) who delivered our food if he wasn't around.  We had to ask for more bread & water refills.

Their recent trip to Spain inspired an idea: TAPAS.  Between my Dad's diabetes and Mom's appetite that rivals that of Nicole Richie's, I thought it best to stay with small portions.  A search of TAPAS on the Talk boards and the general Search function yielded a wealth of recommendations.  Bocadillos didn't take reservations and I didn't think the elders would appreciate the raucous din that is Cha Cha Cha's.  So Alegria's it was.  And what a wise choice.  \n\nOur waiter let me practice my substandard Spanish--I found myself saying \"Mas despacio\" or \"slower please\" and \"Como se dice..\" or \"How do you say...\" throughout our very stilted and time consuming conversation.  But it was fun and I thought he showed remarkable restraint--I'm sure he was silently saying, \"Bitch.  Please.  Order already.\"\n\nOur meal was authentically Spanish, as reported by my parents who had recently made a trip to Barcelona.  The sangria was good, though not the best I've had.  But the 10-year old madeira was amazing and worth its pricetag ($12 for a teensy glass, not more than the amount of a shotglass).  The dishes were classically tapas-sized small and our party of six had to order two servings of several of the dishes as recommended by our ever-patient waiter.  \n\nMy favorite was the empanadillas de carne which were crunchy meat-filled empanadas with lots of flavor and surprisingly light for being fried.

Zarzuela is a better bet.***\n__________________________________________________\n\nMy wife and I went to Alegrias last night for dinner and sat in the table for two in the front of the restaurant.  The curtains over the window mostly hid the the lovely neon parking garage across Lombard.  Our ordering was a bit on the tame side as I'm avoiding meat in an effort to lose some of the  subcutaneous insulation I built up over the holidays.  \nOur menu consisted of:\n\n*Tortilla De Chorizo  $9.95\nClassic Spanish potato, caramelized onion, and Spanish chorizo omelette.\n-- Pretty standard, though at the bottom of the \"standard\" range.  Pretty clearly reheated prior to serving.  A bit dry?\n\n*Calamares Fritos con Alioli $9.95\nFried calamari with aioli sauce.\n--Great aioli.  We took the little ramekin of aioli off of the plate and made good use of it until the sauce was no more.  The calamari was good and crispy, not terribly oily.\n\n*Patatas Bravas $6.95\nCrisp potatoes with spicy red sauce.\n--Unlike any patatas bravas I've ever had.  Totally lame cubes of potato (like the kind that is served with corned beef hash), fried, and served with what was basically a marinara sauce.  Lame; especially since we paid nearly $7 dollars for this mound of disappointment...\n\n*Espinacas a la Catalana $7.50\nSauteed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple, and pine nuts.\n-- This was one of the better dishes, though I felt the spinach was a bit over-cooked and the pine nuts would have benefited from a bit of toasting.  A good mix of flavors.\n\n*Mejillones Alegrias $8.95\nSteamed Mussels in a white wine, garlic, and parsley sauce.\n--This was a highlight.  Though the mussels were a bit on the small side for the West Coast, the broth they were served in was very good.  If I weren't trying to restrict my caloric intake I would have savaged the bread plate and mopped up every last drop of liquid goodness in the bowl.  Then again, I'm like that when it comes to mussels.\n\n*Pimientos Del Piqullo Rellenos  $9.95\nCon Cordero Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb.\n-- The texture on this dish was great, though sadly the lamb was chopped fine (like hamburger) and the flavor was way, way in the background.  Did they rinse the meat after cooking?  The sauce didn't add much to the dish, and had the consistency of melted Velveeta.  This dish fell far short of my expectations.\n\nMy wife had a glass of sangria which was perfect- sweet and with a nice kick, and I started with a glass of fino sherry followed by a nice big balloon glass full of Rioja.  Rioja is one of my favorite wines, and I loved this one.  I wish I could remember what it was, but I think it was the 2003 Bodegas y Viedos Pujanza Rioja.  For reviews see: http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=275384 \n\nOur service was good and well-paced, though we were asked if we were ready to order after having our menus for two minutes, and a few times I found myself searching for our waiter.  The atmosphere has Spanish accents and is homey, though as we sat in the far front we didn't get to see the rest of the place.  It looked like there was a back room which had more atmosphere.  If I had to do it again, I would sit farther back in the restaurant. \n\nAs a silly aside, the people sitting at the table next to us, a couple in their late 40s had a series of increasingly ridiculous conversations that would have made Woody Allen proud.  They covered Tibetan antiques and their worth to thieves, culminating in a conversation about whether the phrase \"Indian-giving\" might be offensive and where it could have come from.

The service is both kind and attentive - I remember calling up twice and asking for reservations to which they politely complied to, as well as our waiters being very personable during our meals.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant romanticizes the experience, or at least gives a solid enough a backdrop for my nostalgia--it's ideal for a mellow romantic date, and even if the person you're out with decides that they want to eat at the (admittedly inexpensive) Chinese restaurant in Chinatown immediately after, you'll still come out smiling.\n\nI'm not particularly versed with their selection of wines, but their Sangria is tasty (unfortunately I haven't been there in a while so I cannot comment on this further). The one drawback that I find from the entire experience is the price relative to how much food you get. Don't get me wrong: the food is great, but you don't get as much as you would hope to in other restaurants. Appetizers are normally around $7.00 to $9.00, and the main dishes go to about $20 per plate. I'm not saying it's not worth it: I'm just saying that it's not wise to go here and expect it to be a cheap hangout (but maybe that's because I'm a student, I don't know). My suggestion is to sample as much of their tapas as you can, and order one paella dish (Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol) if you want variety in your meals.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Alegrias, you'll find the experience to be pleasant. I would recommend trying the following:\n1. Patatas Alioli - it's basically fried potatos bits drizzled in Alioli, but it's still very good. \n2. Cazuela de Caracoles y Almejas -  Snails and Manila clams stewed in red sauce\n3. Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos con Cordero - it's like an Indian samosa with pimiento peppers as the wrap; succulent and one of the few dishes that I find well worth its price.\n4. Croquetas del dia - one time it was ham; the other time it was chicken. Both were great.\n5. Tabla de Quesos y Chorizos Espa\u00f1oles - it's basically a sampling of cheese and sausage from Spain. Take it with wine.\n6. Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol - this is, I think, my favorite paella out of the four available.

Zarzuela is a better bet.***\n__________________________________________________\n\nMy wife and I went to Alegrias last night for dinner and sat in the table for two in the front of the restaurant.  The curtains over the window mostly hid the the lovely neon parking garage across Lombard.  Our ordering was a bit on the tame side as I'm avoiding meat in an effort to lose some of the  subcutaneous insulation I built up over the holidays.  \nOur menu consisted of:\n\n*Tortilla De Chorizo  $9.95\nClassic Spanish potato, caramelized onion, and Spanish chorizo omelette.\n-- Pretty standard, though at the bottom of the \"standard\" range.  Pretty clearly reheated prior to serving.  A bit dry?\n\n*Calamares Fritos con Alioli $9.95\nFried calamari with aioli sauce.\n--Great aioli.  We took the little ramekin of aioli off of the plate and made good use of it until the sauce was no more.  The calamari was good and crispy, not terribly oily.\n\n*Patatas Bravas $6.95\nCrisp potatoes with spicy red sauce.\n--Unlike any patatas bravas I've ever had.  Totally lame cubes of potato (like the kind that is served with corned beef hash), fried, and served with what was basically a marinara sauce.  Lame; especially since we paid nearly $7 dollars for this mound of disappointment...\n\n*Espinacas a la Catalana $7.50\nSauteed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple, and pine nuts.\n-- This was one of the better dishes, though I felt the spinach was a bit over-cooked and the pine nuts would have benefited from a bit of toasting.  A good mix of flavors.\n\n*Mejillones Alegrias $8.95\nSteamed Mussels in a white wine, garlic, and parsley sauce.\n--This was a highlight.  Though the mussels were a bit on the small side for the West Coast, the broth they were served in was very good.  If I weren't trying to restrict my caloric intake I would have savaged the bread plate and mopped up every last drop of liquid goodness in the bowl.  Then again, I'm like that when it comes to mussels.\n\n*Pimientos Del Piqullo Rellenos  $9.95\nCon Cordero Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb.\n-- The texture on this dish was great, though sadly the lamb was chopped fine (like hamburger) and the flavor was way, way in the background.  Did they rinse the meat after cooking?  The sauce didn't add much to the dish, and had the consistency of melted Velveeta.  This dish fell far short of my expectations.\n\nMy wife had a glass of sangria which was perfect- sweet and with a nice kick, and I started with a glass of fino sherry followed by a nice big balloon glass full of Rioja.  Rioja is one of my favorite wines, and I loved this one.  I wish I could remember what it was, but I think it was the 2003 Bodegas y Viedos Pujanza Rioja.  For reviews see: http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=275384 \n\nOur service was good and well-paced, though we were asked if we were ready to order after having our menus for two minutes, and a few times I found myself searching for our waiter.  The atmosphere has Spanish accents and is homey, though as we sat in the far front we didn't get to see the rest of the place.  It looked like there was a back room which had more atmosphere.  If I had to do it again, I would sit farther back in the restaurant. \n\nAs a silly aside, the people sitting at the table next to us, a couple in their late 40s had a series of increasingly ridiculous conversations that would have made Woody Allen proud.  They covered Tibetan antiques and their worth to thieves, culminating in a conversation about whether the phrase \"Indian-giving\" might be offensive and where it could have come from.

It's dimly lit, romantic, and intimate, so love was definitely in the air that night. There was a prix fixe menu, so we got the lobster croquettes, gambas al ajillo (garlic/white wine prawns), lamb stuffed piquillo peppers, jamon serrano, escalivada, and the CALLOS A LA MADRILENA (Note: I thought I'd be adventurous and order the rabbit stew, but they were sold out that night so I'm assuming it's good. Still on my list!). I love me some Spanish food, but I particularly love this place because they offer a lot of dishes that they don't serve at other Spanish restaurants. Everything we ordered was delicious, but it's the callos a la madrilena (Madrid style tripe) that has me coming back to this place. That, and to my pleasant surprise, a waitress that I met at El Torito was serving us that night and it was great to see her again. I stop by this restaurant to say Hi because she's a sweetheart.\n\nNot a lot of restaurants serve this kind of Madrid style tripe in all its yummy tomato sauce glory, so when the craving strikes I go straight here. The last time we ate here, we also tried the garlic mushrooms and the jamon iberico & prawn croquettes, and both are yummy in my tummy. I'd definitely order those again. As an Asian, people find it appalling that I dislike rice, but I like some kinds of rice as long as its different. So we ordered the arroz negro, which is paella cooked in squid ink. It's very flavorful but also very filling so I was stuffed. I've also ordered the manchego flambeado as recommended by other Yelpers, which was cool to watch and to try, but it's not a must have.\n\nTo summarize, Alegrias is a wonderful Spanish restaurant, especially if you want to explore more authentic Spanish dishes (I.E. more than just jamon serrano, manchego cheese, patatas bravas, etc. *yawn*).

With a squeeze of lemon, some extra salt and pepper, it tastes extra satisfying when you're craving carbs at the end of the meal (especially after a ton of sangria).  I wish it had a crust on the bottom, though.\n\nThey were nice enough to let us bring in our own cupcakes for the birthday girl without extra charges.

"], "author": "Jessie L.", "review": "TLDR - Solid Spanish tapas but the dishes lacked a wow factor in comparison to other tapas restaurants in SF\n\nI've basically been slowly going around SF looking for the best Spanish tapas restaurant. Alegrias is a pretty small one sort of hidden away in the Marina. Compared to the other places I've been to, it's definitely on the homier side and it feels very family run. The restaurant is rather cramped inside and has more of a casual, intimate feel. It seems to get busy on the weekend, so make a reservation in advance if you can. \n\nThe menu has a variety of hot tapas, a few cold ones and paella, and there's a solid wine menu as well. The paellas take about 30 minutes, but they time everything pretty well so that there isn't a long wait in between dishes. For 4 people, we ordered 5 tapas, 1 paella and 1 pitcher of sangria for about $130 after tax/tip.\n\nThe dishes and menu offering felt more traditional with none of that flair you sometimes get at more trendy restaurants. The food was pretty good but as a whole, I wasn't wowed. Definitely recommend the Croquetas and Empanadillas though.\n\n* SANGRIA ($26 for pitcher)\nOne pitcher's maybe good for 6 of their glasses (which were on the smaller side for wine glasses). \n\n* EMPANADILLAS DE CARNE ($8.50) - 4.5/5\n[beef, green onions, olives, raisins, herbs]\nComes with only 2 empanadillas, each of which are maybe 2 bites. They're really good though so I'd recommend ordering enough to have your own. The beef filling was sweet and delicious and the outside was crisp without being greasy.\n\n* CROQUETAS DE JAMON IBERICO Y GAMBA ($9.50) - 5/5\n[croquettes filled w/ minced jamon iberico & prawn]\nProbably the best thing we ordered! This one comes with 4 croquetas, each of which was delicately fried on the outside and filled with creamy goodness on the inside.\n\n* ESPINACAS A LA CATALANA ($8.50) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed spinach, garlic, raisins, apple, pine nuts]\nI'm convinced I should be sauteeing my spinach with raisins and apples now to add some sweetness. I was disappointed at how small the portion size was though.. Not really worth ordering in comparison to other dishes.\n\n* PATATAS AIOLI ($8) - 3.5/5\n[crisp fried potatoes, traditional aioli sauce]\nIf you love potatoes, you'll probably like these more than I did. They had a decent crisp to them, but otherwise I found them pretty average. I've had Spanish patatas at other places paired with a tastier sauce. The portion size was big and filling though.\n\n* CONEJO A LA CAZUELA ($13) - 4/5\n[stewed rabbit w/ vegetables & wine]\nThere were only 3 pieces of meat so the dish was disappointing for the price. The tomato broth was tasty but also simple, nothing super special in flavor.\n\n* PAELLA A LA VALENCIANA CON CHORIZO ESPANOL ($29) - 3/5\n[saffron flavored spanish rice, chicken, seafood, chorizo]\nOne of the more disappointing paellas I've had. The chicken was well cooked and the chorizo was tasty, but the seafood was a little overcooked and the rice lacked flavor and fragrance. I always look forward to the crispy rice at the bottom of the pan, but theirs failed to really produce any of that crunch.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-05-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I chose 'Espinacas a la Catalana' and 'Empanadillas de Carne', sooo delicious.

We opted for the group menu and a couple of pitchers of sangria.\n\nUnfortunately, the sangria wasn't as strong as I'd hoped.  We started with bread, olive oil/balsamic, and aceitunas (olives).\n\nThe first course was a salad with candied pecans - pretty standard.

Zarzuela is a better bet.***\n__________________________________________________\n\nMy wife and I went to Alegrias last night for dinner and sat in the table for two in the front of the restaurant.  The curtains over the window mostly hid the the lovely neon parking garage across Lombard.  Our ordering was a bit on the tame side as I'm avoiding meat in an effort to lose some of the  subcutaneous insulation I built up over the holidays.  \nOur menu consisted of:\n\n*Tortilla De Chorizo  $9.95\nClassic Spanish potato, caramelized onion, and Spanish chorizo omelette.\n-- Pretty standard, though at the bottom of the \"standard\" range.  Pretty clearly reheated prior to serving.  A bit dry?\n\n*Calamares Fritos con Alioli $9.95\nFried calamari with aioli sauce.\n--Great aioli.  We took the little ramekin of aioli off of the plate and made good use of it until the sauce was no more.  The calamari was good and crispy, not terribly oily.\n\n*Patatas Bravas $6.95\nCrisp potatoes with spicy red sauce.\n--Unlike any patatas bravas I've ever had.  Totally lame cubes of potato (like the kind that is served with corned beef hash), fried, and served with what was basically a marinara sauce.  Lame; especially since we paid nearly $7 dollars for this mound of disappointment...\n\n*Espinacas a la Catalana $7.50\nSauteed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple, and pine nuts.\n-- This was one of the better dishes, though I felt the spinach was a bit over-cooked and the pine nuts would have benefited from a bit of toasting.  A good mix of flavors.\n\n*Mejillones Alegrias $8.95\nSteamed Mussels in a white wine, garlic, and parsley sauce.\n--This was a highlight.  Though the mussels were a bit on the small side for the West Coast, the broth they were served in was very good.  If I weren't trying to restrict my caloric intake I would have savaged the bread plate and mopped up every last drop of liquid goodness in the bowl.  Then again, I'm like that when it comes to mussels.\n\n*Pimientos Del Piqullo Rellenos  $9.95\nCon Cordero Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb.\n-- The texture on this dish was great, though sadly the lamb was chopped fine (like hamburger) and the flavor was way, way in the background.  Did they rinse the meat after cooking?  The sauce didn't add much to the dish, and had the consistency of melted Velveeta.  This dish fell far short of my expectations.\n\nMy wife had a glass of sangria which was perfect- sweet and with a nice kick, and I started with a glass of fino sherry followed by a nice big balloon glass full of Rioja.  Rioja is one of my favorite wines, and I loved this one.  I wish I could remember what it was, but I think it was the 2003 Bodegas y Viedos Pujanza Rioja.  For reviews see: http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=275384 \n\nOur service was good and well-paced, though we were asked if we were ready to order after having our menus for two minutes, and a few times I found myself searching for our waiter.  The atmosphere has Spanish accents and is homey, though as we sat in the far front we didn't get to see the rest of the place.  It looked like there was a back room which had more atmosphere.  If I had to do it again, I would sit farther back in the restaurant. \n\nAs a silly aside, the people sitting at the table next to us, a couple in their late 40s had a series of increasingly ridiculous conversations that would have made Woody Allen proud.  They covered Tibetan antiques and their worth to thieves, culminating in a conversation about whether the phrase \"Indian-giving\" might be offensive and where it could have come from.

The service is both kind and attentive - I remember calling up twice and asking for reservations to which they politely complied to, as well as our waiters being very personable during our meals.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant romanticizes the experience, or at least gives a solid enough a backdrop for my nostalgia--it's ideal for a mellow romantic date, and even if the person you're out with decides that they want to eat at the (admittedly inexpensive) Chinese restaurant in Chinatown immediately after, you'll still come out smiling.\n\nI'm not particularly versed with their selection of wines, but their Sangria is tasty (unfortunately I haven't been there in a while so I cannot comment on this further). The one drawback that I find from the entire experience is the price relative to how much food you get. Don't get me wrong: the food is great, but you don't get as much as you would hope to in other restaurants. Appetizers are normally around $7.00 to $9.00, and the main dishes go to about $20 per plate. I'm not saying it's not worth it: I'm just saying that it's not wise to go here and expect it to be a cheap hangout (but maybe that's because I'm a student, I don't know). My suggestion is to sample as much of their tapas as you can, and order one paella dish (Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol) if you want variety in your meals.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Alegrias, you'll find the experience to be pleasant. I would recommend trying the following:\n1. Patatas Alioli - it's basically fried potatos bits drizzled in Alioli, but it's still very good. \n2. Cazuela de Caracoles y Almejas -  Snails and Manila clams stewed in red sauce\n3. Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos con Cordero - it's like an Indian samosa with pimiento peppers as the wrap; succulent and one of the few dishes that I find well worth its price.\n4. Croquetas del dia - one time it was ham; the other time it was chicken. Both were great.\n5. Tabla de Quesos y Chorizos Espa\u00f1oles - it's basically a sampling of cheese and sausage from Spain. Take it with wine.\n6. Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol - this is, I think, my favorite paella out of the four available.

Zarzuela is a better bet.***\n__________________________________________________\n\nMy wife and I went to Alegrias last night for dinner and sat in the table for two in the front of the restaurant.  The curtains over the window mostly hid the the lovely neon parking garage across Lombard.  Our ordering was a bit on the tame side as I'm avoiding meat in an effort to lose some of the  subcutaneous insulation I built up over the holidays.  \nOur menu consisted of:\n\n*Tortilla De Chorizo  $9.95\nClassic Spanish potato, caramelized onion, and Spanish chorizo omelette.\n-- Pretty standard, though at the bottom of the \"standard\" range.  Pretty clearly reheated prior to serving.  A bit dry?\n\n*Calamares Fritos con Alioli $9.95\nFried calamari with aioli sauce.\n--Great aioli.  We took the little ramekin of aioli off of the plate and made good use of it until the sauce was no more.  The calamari was good and crispy, not terribly oily.\n\n*Patatas Bravas $6.95\nCrisp potatoes with spicy red sauce.\n--Unlike any patatas bravas I've ever had.  Totally lame cubes of potato (like the kind that is served with corned beef hash), fried, and served with what was basically a marinara sauce.  Lame; especially since we paid nearly $7 dollars for this mound of disappointment...\n\n*Espinacas a la Catalana $7.50\nSauteed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple, and pine nuts.\n-- This was one of the better dishes, though I felt the spinach was a bit over-cooked and the pine nuts would have benefited from a bit of toasting.  A good mix of flavors.\n\n*Mejillones Alegrias $8.95\nSteamed Mussels in a white wine, garlic, and parsley sauce.\n--This was a highlight.  Though the mussels were a bit on the small side for the West Coast, the broth they were served in was very good.  If I weren't trying to restrict my caloric intake I would have savaged the bread plate and mopped up every last drop of liquid goodness in the bowl.  Then again, I'm like that when it comes to mussels.\n\n*Pimientos Del Piqullo Rellenos  $9.95\nCon Cordero Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb.\n-- The texture on this dish was great, though sadly the lamb was chopped fine (like hamburger) and the flavor was way, way in the background.  Did they rinse the meat after cooking?  The sauce didn't add much to the dish, and had the consistency of melted Velveeta.  This dish fell far short of my expectations.\n\nMy wife had a glass of sangria which was perfect- sweet and with a nice kick, and I started with a glass of fino sherry followed by a nice big balloon glass full of Rioja.  Rioja is one of my favorite wines, and I loved this one.  I wish I could remember what it was, but I think it was the 2003 Bodegas y Viedos Pujanza Rioja.  For reviews see: http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=275384 \n\nOur service was good and well-paced, though we were asked if we were ready to order after having our menus for two minutes, and a few times I found myself searching for our waiter.  The atmosphere has Spanish accents and is homey, though as we sat in the far front we didn't get to see the rest of the place.  It looked like there was a back room which had more atmosphere.  If I had to do it again, I would sit farther back in the restaurant. \n\nAs a silly aside, the people sitting at the table next to us, a couple in their late 40s had a series of increasingly ridiculous conversations that would have made Woody Allen proud.  They covered Tibetan antiques and their worth to thieves, culminating in a conversation about whether the phrase \"Indian-giving\" might be offensive and where it could have come from.

We arrived very early, however, the owner agreed to seat us which was really nice.  We were shown to a table way in the back of the rear room (the front room looked more atmospheric).  And there was a huge group that was seated right next to that table then another large table in the back of it.  Needless to say it looked claustrophobic so we asked to be moved which the owner graciously accommodated.  We were so glad we made this decision as the table seated next to the original table we were shown to was filled with a few very extremely stupidly loud men who were obviously drunk.  The noise they created was a total annoyance to not only us but to the other diners who were looking at them.  Thus, one could barely speak to one's dining companions without shouting due to these moronic, conscienceless drunks.  When they finally left after two hours later it was a total relief.\n\nThe food was quite good especially the paella (we ordered the paella a la Valenciana and the paella a la marinera).  We began with three tapas:  Empanadillas de carne, mejilones (mussels), and gambas al ajillo (prawns in garlic sauce).  The mussels were very large and plump/juicy, and the accompanying dish to put the shells could barely fit them all as it was too small; would have been better to have provided a larger dish for the shells.  Shrimp were not that many just a few in a partially spicy garlicky sauce, but the garlic could have been more as it was a bit weak tasting to me. The paellas are in smallish pans than what we're used to in Spain and in the UK.  It can only feed two people at most.  But the ingredients were a good amount, the seafood (clams, mussels, a few pieces of small squid, and prawns) were fresh; the flavor was quite tasty too. The portion was more than what we'd ordered at Los Galayos in Madrid so we were pleased. Owner's husband (I think) came around to encourage my husband to take more of the crisped rice that was at the bottom of the pan.  Some restaurants really burn the rice too much for my liking; Alegrias just did it enough.\n\nDesserts we ordered were the arroz con leche & flan; both were a nice end to a lovely meal.  We also ordered cortados which were nicer than the usual espresso since there was a layer of frothy milk on the top.\n\nWe had a simple Spanish white wine with dinner-a Muscadet.  A bit sweet but it accompanied the meal well anyhow.\n\nThe only negatives were small.  First was being shown to that awful table way in the back of the rear room and next to a bunch of loutish types.  We made a reservation two days prior so it was a bit surprising to be shown to such a poor location.  Secondly the service was erratic perhaps because the owner mentioned and apologized that staff called in sick.  However, our waiter came timely to take our order & give us our bill.  Otherwise, it was a different waiter (or waiters) who delivered our food if he wasn't around.  We had to ask for more bread & water refills.  Seems from other reviews that when they're quiet there is much better/attentive service.\n\nIn any event, we will surely be returning as there are hardly any Spanish restaurants in SF especially one that is family-owned.

Alegrias is a pretty small one sort of hidden away in the Marina. Compared to the other places I've been to, it's definitely on the homier side and it feels very family run. The restaurant is rather cramped inside and has more of a casual, intimate feel. It seems to get busy on the weekend, so make a reservation in advance if you can. \n\nThe menu has a variety of hot tapas, a few cold ones and paella, and there's a solid wine menu as well. The paellas take about 30 minutes, but they time everything pretty well so that there isn't a long wait in between dishes. For 4 people, we ordered 5 tapas, 1 paella and 1 pitcher of sangria for about $130 after tax/tip.\n\nThe dishes and menu offering felt more traditional with none of that flair you sometimes get at more trendy restaurants. The food was pretty good but as a whole, I wasn't wowed. Definitely recommend the Croquetas and Empanadillas though.\n\n* SANGRIA ($26 for pitcher)\nOne pitcher's maybe good for 6 of their glasses (which were on the smaller side for wine glasses). \n\n* EMPANADILLAS DE CARNE ($8.50) - 4.5/5\n[beef, green onions, olives, raisins, herbs]\nComes with only 2 empanadillas, each of which are maybe 2 bites. They're really good though so I'd recommend ordering enough to have your own. The beef filling was sweet and delicious and the outside was crisp without being greasy.\n\n* CROQUETAS DE JAMON IBERICO Y GAMBA ($9.50) - 5/5\n[croquettes filled w/ minced jamon iberico & prawn]\nProbably the best thing we ordered! This one comes with 4 croquetas, each of which was delicately fried on the outside and filled with creamy goodness on the inside.\n\n* ESPINACAS A LA CATALANA ($8.50) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed spinach, garlic, raisins, apple, pine nuts]\nI'm convinced I should be sauteeing my spinach with raisins and apples now to add some sweetness. I was disappointed at how small the portion size was though.. Not really worth ordering in comparison to other dishes.\n\n* PATATAS AIOLI ($8) - 3.5/5\n[crisp fried potatoes, traditional aioli sauce]\nIf you love potatoes, you'll probably like these more than I did. They had a decent crisp to them, but otherwise I found them pretty average. I've had Spanish patatas at other places paired with a tastier sauce. The portion size was big and filling though.\n\n* CONEJO A LA CAZUELA ($13) - 4/5\n[stewed rabbit w/ vegetables & wine]\nThere were only 3 pieces of meat so the dish was disappointing for the price. The tomato broth was tasty but also simple, nothing super special in flavor.\n\n* PAELLA A LA VALENCIANA CON CHORIZO ESPANOL ($29) - 3/5\n[saffron flavored spanish rice, chicken, seafood, chorizo]\nOne of the more disappointing paellas I've had. The chicken was well cooked and the chorizo was tasty, but the seafood was a little overcooked and the rice lacked flavor and fragrance.

", "We began with three tapas:  "], "author": "Luisa T.", "review": "We made an Open Table reservation for a Saturday night recently after reading how popular this restaurant is.  We arrived very early, however, the owner agreed to seat us which was really nice.  We were shown to a table way in the back of the rear room (the front room looked more atmospheric).  And there was a huge group that was seated right next to that table then another large table in the back of it.  Needless to say it looked claustrophobic so we asked to be moved which the owner graciously accommodated.  We were so glad we made this decision as the table seated next to the original table we were shown to was filled with a few very extremely stupidly loud men who were obviously drunk.  The noise they created was a total annoyance to not only us but to the other diners who were looking at them.  Thus, one could barely speak to one's dining companions without shouting due to these moronic, conscienceless drunks.  When they finally left after two hours later it was a total relief.\n\nThe food was quite good especially the paella (we ordered the paella a la Valenciana and the paella a la marinera).  We began with three tapas:  Empanadillas de carne, mejilones (mussels), and gambas al ajillo (prawns in garlic sauce).  The mussels were very large and plump/juicy, and the accompanying dish to put the shells could barely fit them all as it was too small; would have been better to have provided a larger dish for the shells.  Shrimp were not that many just a few in a partially spicy garlicky sauce, but the garlic could have been more as it was a bit weak tasting to me. The paellas are in smallish pans than what we're used to in Spain and in the UK.  It can only feed two people at most.  But the ingredients were a good amount, the seafood (clams, mussels, a few pieces of small squid, and prawns) were fresh; the flavor was quite tasty too. The portion was more than what we'd ordered at Los Galayos in Madrid so we were pleased. Owner's husband (I think) came around to encourage my husband to take more of the crisped rice that was at the bottom of the pan.  Some restaurants really burn the rice too much for my liking; Alegrias just did it enough.\n\nDesserts we ordered were the arroz con leche & flan; both were a nice end to a lovely meal.  We also ordered cortados which were nicer than the usual espresso since there was a layer of frothy milk on the top.\n\nWe had a simple Spanish white wine with dinner-a Muscadet.  A bit sweet but it accompanied the meal well anyhow.\n\nThe only negatives were small.  First was being shown to that awful table way in the back of the rear room and next to a bunch of loutish types.  We made a reservation two days prior so it was a bit surprising to be shown to such a poor location.  Secondly the service was erratic perhaps because the owner mentioned and apologized that staff called in sick.  However, our waiter came timely to take our order & give us our bill.  Otherwise, it was a different waiter (or waiters) who delivered our food if he wasn't around.  We had to ask for more bread & water refills.  Seems from other reviews that when they're quiet there is much better/attentive service.\n\nIn any event, we will surely be returning as there are hardly any Spanish restaurants in SF especially one that is family-owned.

It ended up not making any difference... the place was pretty empty for a Friday night at 7pm. It kinda worried me...\n\nWe were greeted upon walking in and asked if we wanted to sit in the front or back part of the dining room. We opted for the back and were seated by a group of 4 having a girls' night, which ended up being not too great for us because we couldn't have all that much of a conversation due to them talking a lot and quite loud. I can't really blame them, but it could have been prevented since most of the restaurant was empty. \n\nThe Face and I started with ordering the Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol and a pitcher of red Sangria... figured it would be better than by the glass at $5.50. I'm not much of a drinker of anything, so I maybe had the equivalent of 1 glass (Sir Face kept pouring more in my glass even though I never even got halfway) while he had most of the rest. \n\nAfter some time and bread, we also ordered the beef empanadillas and the patatas bravas. The empanadillas were delicious. The flavor was great and the barely crisp shell was made very well. One thing that can probably change, though, is that the center was just warm. The potatoes were good, but seemed to be missing just a little something... a tad more salt, maybe some more aioli... I was quite excited when the paella came out as I've never had it before. The server gave us clean plates and served the paella to us too. Even after all that... we still got more bread and I noticed that he went for a new plate for the bread as well. It wasn't necessary, but a nice touch. It was pretty good, but I don't care too much for mussels or clams... or calamari if it isn't fried. The chorizo was also a little on the dry side.\n\nOverall, great meal (despite the girls we sat next to) and great service. Someone always stopped by to check on us throughout the meal. The best part? Because I mentioned that it was for his birthday, we got a comped dessert of the flan. I didn't even notice it until the server was right behind Mr. Face lighting the candle... haha.

The service is both kind and attentive - I remember calling up twice and asking for reservations to which they politely complied to, as well as our waiters being very personable during our meals.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant romanticizes the experience, or at least gives a solid enough a backdrop for my nostalgia--it's ideal for a mellow romantic date, and even if the person you're out with decides that they want to eat at the (admittedly inexpensive) Chinese restaurant in Chinatown immediately after, you'll still come out smiling.\n\nI'm not particularly versed with their selection of wines, but their Sangria is tasty (unfortunately I haven't been there in a while so I cannot comment on this further). The one drawback that I find from the entire experience is the price relative to how much food you get. Don't get me wrong: the food is great, but you don't get as much as you would hope to in other restaurants. Appetizers are normally around $7.00 to $9.00, and the main dishes go to about $20 per plate. I'm not saying it's not worth it: I'm just saying that it's not wise to go here and expect it to be a cheap hangout (but maybe that's because I'm a student, I don't know). My suggestion is to sample as much of their tapas as you can, and order one paella dish (Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol) if you want variety in your meals.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Alegrias, you'll find the experience to be pleasant. I would recommend trying the following:\n1. Patatas Alioli - it's basically fried potatos bits drizzled in Alioli, but it's still very good. \n2. Cazuela de Caracoles y Almejas -  Snails and Manila clams stewed in red sauce\n3. Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos con Cordero - it's like an Indian samosa with pimiento peppers as the wrap; succulent and one of the few dishes that I find well worth its price.\n4. Croquetas del dia - one time it was ham; the other time it was chicken. Both were great.\n5. Tabla de Quesos y Chorizos Espa\u00f1oles - it's basically a sampling of cheese and sausage from Spain. Take it with wine.\n6. Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol - this is, I think, my favorite paella out of the four available. It has both seafood and chicken as well as chorizos (a personal favorite).", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-03-16"}], "paella a la valenciana con chorizo espaol": [], "paella de verduras": [{"excerpts": ["Paella de Verduras-full of seafood.

I called them to inquire, and the lady who picked up my call was so nice as to prepare our table as we were walking there (it took about 10 minutes for our large group to leisurely saunter over).\n\nMy first impression of the restaurant when I first walked in was that it was very intimate and romantic. The inside is dimly lit and has a cozy feel to it. Most of the tables were occupied by couples young and old going for a Saturday night dinner date. We were seated in the back area where they had prepared our table, and it felt even more romantic in there because they had these strings of yellow lights strung up along the walls.\n\nFor 9 people, we ordered 3 paellas (each paella serves around 2) and 14 tapas dishes and that was a good amount of food.\n\nFor me the highlights of the meal were:\n\nArroz negro (paella): liked the squid ink paella a lot more than the other two paellas we got. The flavor was more subtle than the seafood paella but it still had really good flavor.\n\nEmpanadillas de carne: these small empanadas were served piping hot. The filling was very tasty and full of yummy meat juices.\n\nTortilla de chorizo: a potato omelette with onions and chorizo. It was my first time eating this dish but I found myself really enjoying it!\n\nSetas al ajillo: sauteed mushrooms.

Still on my list!). I love me some Spanish food, but I particularly love this place because they offer a lot of dishes that they don't serve at other Spanish restaurants. Everything we ordered was delicious, but it's the callos a la madrilena (Madrid style tripe) that has me coming back to this place. That, and to my pleasant surprise, a waitress that I met at El Torito was serving us that night and it was great to see her again. I stop by this restaurant to say Hi because she's a sweetheart.\n\nNot a lot of restaurants serve this kind of Madrid style tripe in all its yummy tomato sauce glory, so when the craving strikes I go straight here. The last time we ate here, we also tried the garlic mushrooms and the jamon iberico & prawn croquettes, and both are yummy in my tummy. I'd definitely order those again. As an Asian, people find it appalling that I dislike rice, but I like some kinds of rice as long as its different. So we ordered the arroz negro, which is paella cooked in squid ink.
