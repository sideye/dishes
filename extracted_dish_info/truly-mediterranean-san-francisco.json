Seems as though this pan atop the grill was merely a vessel rather than a means for keeps the meat hot, juicy, and delicious. Re-heating the meat at this point yielded only a slight improvement but was mostly a lost cause. The lamb's accompaniments added bulk (and the glorious onion breath we all desire) to the meal but not much else.\n\nTo scoop up smooth, but not overly creamy, and yes, quite flavorful hummus, we received oodles of heated pitas. Quantity does not make up for quality though and while the hummus hit the spot, the rest of the meal left me longing.

Credits go to the BF who have been frequenting here for quite some time. \n\nThe first time there, I ordered a lamb shawerma and chose to eat it there--on the cushioned stools, facing the mirror. Being a complete newbie, I didn't realize that there was only one correct end to open the tin foil. I opened mine from the bottom (wrong side).  Just when I was about the dive in, the cashier quickly caught my attention, and rushed over to re-wrap my shawerma with tin foil. The top (correct end) is open, you see, and had the cashier not saved me, I would have been left with bits of lamb, yogurt sauce, onions, etc. falling onto on my lap. Great service--even from behind the counter! The shawerma was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning and tenderness of the meat. \n\nThe second time, I got the lamb shawerma again. Opened it up from the top end. No mishaps there except the mess I made from devouring the thing.\n\nYesterday, my third time, I was lucky enough to go on a chicken day (Tuesdays and Fridays). Got the chicken shawerma (with hot sauce, of course). Once again, lived up to expectations..and in fact, I like the chicken more than the lamb. Need to make a mental note to visit more frequently on chicken days. \n\nMake sure to get the hot sauce!
