I asked if we order at the counter or take a seat, they told us to just sit wherever.  Walking down the stairs into the dining room, you find a cute little loft setting for a dining area with picture of San Francisco, and some art piece on the walls.  \n\nThen I noticed the oddities.  There was a wooden screen semi-blocking a computer, desk, chair, boxes and a bike.  Hence, my curiocity of it being a storage area.  But oh well.

Not only were the not visually appealing for dessert, but they both really lacked any other flavor and creativity.  The Mango Medley was blended mangos, with Jello pieces of Aloe, cut up apple pieces and mango on top.  Eh...thats all I can say.  Nothing special at all.  \n\nThe Mango Ice Cream Pillows, if you are wondering what these are, is pretty much a Crepe pancake wrapper with a scoop of mango ice cream, wipe cream, and a piece of mango inside.  It was just alright, I would've preferred it to have been a little pan-fried on the top drizzled caramel and more powderd suger.  =X I'm so bad.\n\nI would definitely prefer to come back here for dinner or lunch sometimes as their regular menu seems to be pretty interesting with all of the diverse options to chose from.\n\nService here stinks!

But I was really tempted to get the special mango dessert for $6.50 that comes with mango chunks, almond jelly, and scoop of vanilla ice cream. I think there were variations as to what you wanted to be added to your mango \"sundae\". I had a small taste of my friend's sundae and it was good - sweet and satisfying.

To my surprise, this visit (probably my 4th or 5th on ever) was the best out of any of them.\n\nSome changes had been made since I last visited Mango Medley. For one, the dining room is the only place you can enter into now. Before there was another room that overlooked the kitchen, past a counter, with a huge menu over it, that made it confusing as to where to stand and wait for a table. That area is now blocked off, making the walk-in process much more straightforward, though now I'm not sure where you'd stand if all the tables are full. Probably outside.\n\nSecondly, rather than have any sort of server, the owner and chef was the one to seat us and take our order. We came in at 9:30 on a Thursday and there were only a few tables besides us. Even still, service had a bit to be desired. I was very happy that this was the first time I actually felt taken care of, though, service-wise.\n\nThirdly, the menus for Dinner and Dessert have been updated. My go-to Salmon Pineapple Bacon fried rice is now \"Pineapple bacon fried rice with choice of meat\" (no salmon option, *sadface* ). And no more avocado or taro shake, (also *sadface*). The menus are so extensive, though, that it's easy to try a new thing every time you come in. And with their track record for good food, it wouldn't be a mistake.\n\nTHE FOOD (!!!) as always, and maybe even better than what I remember, was so so good. Mango Medley always has a homemade quality with personal touches to it, everything I've ever ordered from here has been delicious. This particular evening we had:\n\nBeef Brisket Soup\nSeafood Curry w/ Rice\nSoy Ginger Drink, LG\n\nI couldn't decide between the Oxtail and Beef Brisket soup, but ended up going with the brisket as it came with noodles. Added egg for $1.50 extra. The flavor of the broth was out-of-this-world rich and gratifying. The meat was tender and flavorful and just like the most succulent pot roast out of a slow cooker. The addition of Asian greens and mushrooms added complexity and good texture. Yum.\n\nSeafood Curry came with some shrimp, mussels, and pieces of fish in a yellow curry sauce. Rice was extra, $1.50 or $2 I think, but you gotta have it with your curry! This dish was also delicious and we both were able to get one mussel and a couple shrimp each when sharing it.\n\nThe hot Ginger Soy drink we ordered to go after paying, and it was delicious. Very spicy, warm, and sweet without being overpowering. The perfect way to end a nice night out walking into the cool evening. \n\nAlthough the service is still left to be desired, this has got to be my smoothest experience at this strange but delicious little restaurant.

I asked if we order at the counter or take a seat, they told us to just sit wherever.  Walking down the stairs into the dining room, you find a cute little loft setting for a dining area with picture of San Francisco, and some art piece on the walls.  \n\nThen I noticed the oddities.  There was a wooden screen semi-blocking a computer, desk, chair, boxes and a bike.  Hence, my curiocity of it being a storage area.  But oh well.  Haha.  \n\nFurthermore, Mango Medley is confused between being Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian.\n\nThe appetizer section had options ranging from Japanese Gyoza, to Vietnamese Spring Rolls, to Indian Roti...you get the picture.  For entree's it ranges from Hong Kong Baked rice and spaghetti items, Pineapple Fried Rice, Katsu...and a section of vegetarian options. \n\nWhile Mango Medley is diverse, and has a picture menu of options, it was a bit difficult to decide on what to order.  \n\nHowever, my little sister and I had came here after dinner with our folks at Dragon River, so we were only in the mood for dessert.   \n\nWe decided on the Mango Medley as of course the name of the place implies, as well as the Mango Ice Cream \"Pillows.\"  \n\nBoth were disappointments.  Not only were the not visually appealing for dessert, but they both really lacked any other flavor and creativity.  The Mango Medley was blended mangos, with Jello pieces of Aloe, cut up apple pieces and mango on top.  Eh...thats all I can say.  Nothing special at all.  \n\nThe Mango Ice Cream Pillows, if you are wondering what these are, is pretty much a Crepe pancake wrapper with a scoop of mango ice cream, wipe cream, and a piece of mango inside.  It was just alright, I would've preferred it to have been a little pan-fried on the top drizzled caramel and more powderd suger.  =X I'm so bad.\n\nI would definitely prefer to come back here for dinner or lunch sometimes as their regular menu seems to be pretty interesting with all of the diverse options to chose from.\n\nService here stinks!

Shrimp is tender and not chewy.\n2) Seaweed Salad with Tobiko - so good! Wakame, lettuce, tobiko, miso dressing, and sesame seeds - pretty standard but done right.\n2) Vietnamese Spring Rolls (Vegetarian) - yummy veggie alternative to the shrimp ones (tofu and shitake mushrooms instead of shrimp).\n\nEntrees:\n1) Ramen with Mixed Mushrooms in Soy Broth - the best I ever had! Even better than Japantown. Fresh, crisp veggies and a variety of mushrooms. Broth is tasty and noodles are perfectly done.\n2) Spinach Noodles with Tofu and Mixed Mushrooms - my old standby. Flavorful and filling.\n3) Rice Wine Tofu and Mushrooms over Rice - great light dish if you aren't that hungry. So very tasty!\n4) Tamarind Tofu and Veggies over Rice - my bf's favorite! Lots of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness.\n5) Garlic Basil Linguine with White Wine Sake Sauce - So yummy!

Pretty simple dish - ripe mangoes, whip cream, crepes - but oh so good!\n3) Mango Bliss (buttermilk panna cotta and mango sorbet version) - tasty, refreshing, and fruity - a must if you love mangoes.\n\nDrinks:\n1) Hot Ginger Honey - my usual order, a definite must on a cold, foggy day/night. Fresh pressed ginger juice, water, and honey - oh so good for you!\n2) Hot Milk Green Tea with Soy Milk - my go-to drink of choice if it weren't for the calories. Yummy milky goodness!\n3) Hot Chai Latte - so tasty!

We thought it was weird that only one thing came out and not all of them at the same time, but we figured they were kinda busy, and the others would be out shortly\n\nAbout 10-20 minutes later the next two dishes came. the doufu fa and mango tofu fa. By this time, all the surrounding tables we found were OUT OF SPOONS. We managed to scavenge one up, but one of my friends had to eat his doufu fa with chopsticks. Yes, chopsticks. You can all imagine how well that worked out for him xD. I tried some of my friend's mango doufu fa, and I thought it was a bit weird mixing the mango with the ginger, but she liked it.\n\nLast but not least came the cream pillows. They were alright, but like i mentioned in my picture, they were just crepes with some more folds in them. Now, that's not a bad thing, i love me some crepes, but I wish this was explained a bit more.\n\nThe waitress herself was nice and she joked with me a bit when she was taking our orders. However, she only came to our table to drop off food. When we asked for anything else, she said okay, give her a minute, and never came back. *poof*\n\nAnother gripe: They charge $0.50 for hot water. Really? They don't even charge for hot water in China...\n\nThe decor and ambiance here were decent.

Flavorful and filling.\n3) Rice Wine Tofu and Mushrooms over Rice - great light dish if you aren't that hungry. So very tasty!\n4) Tamarind Tofu and Veggies over Rice - my bf's favorite! Lots of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness.\n5) Garlic Basil Linguine with White Wine Sake Sauce - So yummy! If you need a garlic fix, this is for you!\n\nDesserts:\n1) Panne Cotta with Fruit Sauce - light, refreshing, and delish!\n2) Mango Crepes (I think they are called mango pillows) - yummy! Pretty simple dish - ripe mangoes, whip cream, crepes - but oh so good!\n3) Mango Bliss (buttermilk panna cotta and mango sorbet version) - tasty, refreshing, and fruity - a must if you love mangoes.\n\nDrinks:\n1) Hot Ginger Honey - my usual order, a definite must on a cold, foggy day/night. Fresh pressed ginger juice, water, and honey - oh so good for you!\n2) Hot Milk Green Tea with Soy Milk - my go-to drink of choice if it weren't for the calories. Yummy milky goodness!\n3) Hot Chai Latte - so tasty! Maybe not as authentic as the chai tea at Golden Gate Pizza and Indian Cuisine down the street, but still a tasty blend of spices and milk.\n\nThe parking sucks, as are the wait and service (hence the minus 1 star), but as I said before - THE FOOD IS WORTH IT!!!! Especially if you are vegetarian. Prices are reasonable and ambiance is cozy. They just expanded the seating so that should help with the late night rushes.

When we first walked in, Mango Medley looked more like a coffee shop then anything else.  It's a bit small, but it does have a cozy type of feel to it.  \n\n    They did have a regular food menu, but we didn't really look at it since we were only there for dessert.

The panna cotta was rich and creamy, and the mangoes were just the way I liked them.  Not overly ripe, but firm, sweet, and with tart undertones.  I was too full to try the desserts my friends ordered, but they claimed it was good.\n\nThe only hiccup was that my friend's Mango Medley Delight took forever to come.

The chick with the ugly pixie haircut that knows only how to utter phrases such as \"Uh yeah\", \"No\", \"Leave it\", \"What is that?\" has thee worst customer service EVER. Reasons for this are as followed:\n\n#1) My friends and I walked in and the place was empty, but what do you expect it's a weekday around 11pm so I wasn't expecting anything. But  I DID expect to see a waiter or waitress or someone at the cashier --NOPE. We seat ourselves anyways even though it looked like it was closed, but we knew it was open because we had called earlier. I shout for hello a couple of times but STILL no  one is there. We get the menus ourselves and we figure out what we want, and granted that it's our first time there we aren't sure if maybe we're supposed to go up and order? So we do. Finally the short haired chick \"waitress\" comes out of god knows where since the place is so small, and we ask if we order here. She replies \"No.\" Okay this chick is getting on my nerves already for the rude and blunt customer service. MINUS ONE STAR\n\n#2) We seat ourselves yet again and she finally comes and takes our order. I order the mango medley delight. Then my friend orders #24, the \"waitress\" responds by saying \"What is that?\".. UH, how do you not know what is on the menu? And even if you did not know, don't be rude and act dumb.  Are you serious?? Rude service yet again while not knowing about your own work establishment, i.e., the MENU when youre a waiter for pete's sake, are you kidding me?! MINUS ONE STAR\n\n#3) We get our food after about fifteen minutes or so, and my friend receives her spicy tomato fried rice first. Then comes my mango medley delight. I was really excited it came because I was getting a little hungry. I take one bite and I actually like it! Take another one, and it's pretty good! Then BAM! It's not even one strand of black hair, its like THREE OR FOUR TANGLED OR CRUMPLED TOGETHER LIKE A KNOT in the middle of my dessert! At this point, I'm pretty annoyed.  I go up to the counter because obviously if I called for service earlier and she doesn't come, why try again for the third time?! So I go up there, and there she is, in the kitchen with some other lady that I assume is the cook. I wave to her and say \"hello\" she just LOOKS at me and turns her head away continuing to talk to the other lady. UH HELLO?! I shout again, she doesnt even turn her head this time. But a moment later she just comes up to the counter, no response. I tell her there is a piece of hair knot in my dessert and she just goes \"Uh.\" And walks back to the kitchen. I'm standing there like WTF. She comes back and says \"Uh yeah\" and I go... \"Do i leave it here?\" And she goes \"Leave it\". WOW.  MINUS TWO STARS\n\n#4) She comes back a few minutes later, which was obvious to me that she probably just took out the hair and dumped a bunch of mangoes on top. She doesn't even say sorry or ANYTHING to me. And apparently she was snickering while giving it to me. I'm pretty annoyed at that point and I in my normal voice just vent out the horrible customer service and how she probably just gave me the old one. I know she heard me but she doesn't even care. I eat the mangoes on the bottom and don't even finish half of my dessert. I don't even bother leaving any tip because WHAT SERVICE WAS THERE?! She doesn't even come to give us the check when its been an hour and not ONCE does she come check up on us. We just walk up there and my friend tells her we want our checks separately. She mumbles something under her breath, who knows wth she is saying. I was thinking about arguing with her but I had no valid proof that she gave me the old one, just my voice against hers. \n\nMango Medley has got to be the worse asian dessert customer service that I have EVER encountered. I know every other asian dessert place in SF is whatever on the customer service for the most part, but ARE YOU SERIOUS MANGO MEDLEY?! To be frank, where did that knot of TANGLED BLACK HAIR even COME FROM? It was all stringy and black while the waitress had obviously dyed her hair and the cook in the back had brown hair too, SO WHERE DID THE HAIR EVEN COME FROM? \n\nThe food is not bad, don't get me wrong, although the hair is questionable in it's own right. My friends and I could have easily dined & dashed because this chick was seriously ABSENT, and when she was there, she was so rude and dumb. I'm never coming back here, EVER! That little turd, she's lucky that I did NOT go Korean on her ass because I was pretty damn furious. And I'm still thinking right now as I'm writing this review, why I did not fight with her. God damn you waitress from Mango Medley, ruined my night.", "rating": 1, "date": "2010-12-29"}], "crme brulee": []}
