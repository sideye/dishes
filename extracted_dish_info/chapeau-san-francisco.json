I ordered three course meal-Fourme D'Ambert Tart, Bouillabaisse, and Bail Napoleon. \n\nThe complimentary Tomato Soup with Basil Oil was very delicious. I usually do not like tomato soup, but I gave a try and I liked this one. It wasn't overwhelming with tomatoes .\n\nMy son liked his soup and dinner. He had no complaints and will see himself coming back to try other dishes.\n\n-Fourme D'Ambert Tart:\nThe fris\u00e9e salad with pear was refreshing with right amount of acidity. I am not a cheese person so the cheese on the tart was a little too strong for me.\n-Bouillabaisse:\nIf you like seafood, this is the dish. The scallop was tender and sweet. The clams were fresh. I wished the mussels were in a larger size so that I can taste the meat of the mussels.  I don't know which fish, dorado or bronzini or both, tasted fishy. Maybe the fish skin that released the fishy taste? I usually marinate my fish with a little fresh ginger juice to get rid of any fishiness when I prepare my fish dish. I also wished the fish was a little thicker filet so that I could taste the sweetness of the fish. The shrimp was ok. Overall, the dish was well-seasoned, not salty and I enjoyed it very much even though the fish was a little fishy.\n-Basil Napoleon:\nLight, refreshing, not overly sweet. I can eat this dessert everyday. \n\nI will definitely come back with my whole family and/or friends there.\n\nThe chef came out and greeted almost every table.

The red theme and line drawing of a woman holding a glass of red wine with a large chapeau tipped over her eyes is rather eye-catching. So I made a reservation and we came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The interior was cramped and the dim orange lighting made it feel like even more of a tight squeeze. However, it looked nice with flowers on the tables, white tablecloths, and a small bar.\nWe both went with the 3-course menu (currently $44.50), which was not a bad price considering it costs about $10 more than an entree. \n\nSeared Foie Gras:\nThe plate had a very nice sized slab of foie gras. The slab was accompanied with neatly arranged apple slices and some microgreens over a gastrique drizzled on the plate. The outer part was slightly over-seared and a little rubbery. It was still deliciously rich and fatty, while the sauce and the apple slices added sweetness and crunch to the dish.\n\nFrench Onion Soup:\nor Traditional Onion Soup as they call it, was good. Mr. Joy ordered this and I was surprised he liked it even after he ate all the cheese and was left with caramelized onions in broth.\n\nBouillabaisse - Striped Bass, Thai Snapper, Alaskan Halibut Cheeks, P.E.I. Mussels & Manila Clam, Poached in a Fish Fumet, Fondue Proven\u00e7ale, Croutons with Gruy\u00e8re & Rouille :\nGood, I just wish there was more of it. There were a few pieces of fish embedded in the soup, about 3 mussels and clams each. The fish broth was light, but savory. The 'crouton' was actually toasted bread with shredded gruyere. \n\nCanard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices - Duck Breast, Celery Root Puree, Honey & Spiced Duck Jus:\nDelicious duck breast went very well with the sauce. Maybe because I'm Asian, I just think it would be even better if the skin was broiled until crunchy. \n\nFrench Toast - Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Anglaise:\nDelicious take on French toast. The toast was so soft, almost a custard texture. Salted caramel ice cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. \n\nProfiteroles:\n3 profiteroles covered in thick chocolate sauce and almond slivers. These were okay, but the puff pastry was a little stale, possibly left in the fridge for a while. The chocolate sauce was cold. I've definitely had better profiteroles. \n\nThe prices aren't bad for French fare, but certainly getting up there. The food was pretty good. It would be nicer if there was a little more room to spread out. If I find myself back here again, I may try the filet mignon with bone marrow.

"], "author": "Mark L.", "review": "I came here because of the ratings.  with over 2000 raters getting 4 1/2 stars is impressive.  And it's quite difficult to rate this restaurant because it's not a traditional French restaurant you visit.\n\nTherefore, it's difficult to rate against other elegant French restaurants and according to Yelp, 3 stars is good rating.  This restaurant definitely is not \"as good as it gets\" (4 stars).  If just based on the food, it's definitely a 4 stars better than many 1 Michelin star restaurants I went to but the overall package is not a 4 stars.  Frankly, I can't say \"I'm a fan\" neither because the overall experience (not just the quality of the food) is not what I expect from how they price their dishes.\n\nService:\n\n1.  Overall, server are courteous.  However, they lacked of the \"classy restaurant\" training.  Case in point, we sit next to a divided wall where servers, for their convenient, taking plates and serving foods across the divided half wall... that feels... not classy.\n\n2.  The kind of restaurants Chapeau! categorized with, I never had to get the server attention.  Which means it's not understaffed.  I had to ask for water twice, ask to order a glass of wine, asked for bread twice (sorry, kids were hungry), asked to order and asked for a check.\n\n3.  The bus (both of them) were very friendly, hard working but one expects more from a French restaurant at this caliber.  They are wonderful servers and I loved to dine with such staff.  However, they need more training to serve in a classy French restaurant.  One server use a towel when he pours water to prevent water bounce on to the table or the customer, that's training!  However, the other servers obviously didn't have as much training... such as serving dishes between me and my wife while he could have wait to serve from the opening of the table (there were someone standing by our table, I believe it's a server for another table)\n\nDecor:\n\n1.  Even though Chapeau! priced as a high class restaurant, the decor is more like a casual bistro.  The lighting is good but if you look at the decor... the molding around the ceiling and the walls, the chairs, wooden chairs that has no style nor character... feels like you walked into a rustic cafeteria.  \n\n2.  Extra chairs were stacked outside the restaurant by a lack luster single door entry.  I believe if pay more attention to design detail, it can make this a much stylish French restaurant.\n\n3.  The entry was divided by a curtain cornered at the entry.  Lack sincerity. \n\n4.  Bathrooms... I've been to many small restaurants in the city.  The food is no where near the quality of Chapeau! but they were thoughtful and stylish design even with very small space.  But the decor in the bathroom looks like those at some cheap Chinese restaurants.    Design can be done at low cost, again it's how much thoughts they put in to it.\n\nFood:\n\n1.  Cream of corn soup with crab cake and dash of truffle oil - Impressive.  It's creamy but not  heavy.  The flavorful chunky crab cake was just the proper portion.\n\n2.  Baked onion soup - This is not a traditional onion soup.  Because traditional onion soup is not delicious... they are always too salty.  This onion soup emit enormous sweetness...  The beef stock was subtle, didn't overwhelm the onion flavor. The cheese they use is probably Gruyere,  Its aroma and chewiness made the soup perfect.  Personally, I would like to see more cheese, but that just for cheese lover like myself.\n\n3.  Blue cheese tart - I had to say layers were so crispy and buttery, the blue cheese didn't overwhelm the rest of the tart.  It's quite good even for someone who's not a fan of blue cheese.\n\n4.  Foie Gras - It was good.  The timing was perfect... it melts in your mouth but still can flavor the crispiness on the outside.  The only comment I have is that the quality of the goose liver.  I've had better where the chef removed all the tendon/vessels inside the liver.  The one I had still have a little bit in it.  But then, even in some highly rated restaurant in the city, I've had worse experience with the Foie Gras.  Thus, I've no complaint.\n\n5.  Filet Mignon - This is done perfect.  I've seen steak done perfectly medium rare, most places will over cooked it and some under.  Chapeau! did it perfectly.  The mushroom sauce is a bit on the salty side but the steak was not marinated much so it turned out to be a perfect balance.  If anything (trying to be a perfectionist), I'd like a bit more crispy, which means about 50 degree higher heat to slightly burn the outside of the steak to make the crispiness stand out.\n\n6. Seared duck breast - Perfect done. amazingly tender!\n\n7. Bouillabaisse - was smaller than expected.  Especially if you had it in France.  The flavor is good, but the lemon in soup was a bit strong.  It was not my favorite dish.\n\nAll in all, it feels like a Chinese run restaurant with a 1 Michelin star French chef in the culinary.

We were greeted by the Chef and seated immediately.  Legit.  Our waiter had a very thick French accent, which was hard to understand at times.  He even called us madam and misses. Gentleman brownie points.  I was tempted to joke and say bonjourno monsieur but held back.\n\nThey served unlimited fresh sliced baguettes which was awesome. What was best was that we didn't have to ask the waiters for refill. They knew wassup and gave us another fresh basket right away.  We probably went through 5 baskets of those bad boys.

The Foie Gras was bomb diggity ding dongalicious.  It had a nice crisp on the outside topped with a pear glazed sauce.  Once you bite into it, it melted like butter.  That's a big statement coming from someone who usually doesn't like fatty meat.  The sliced apples gave a crisp contrast taste with the Foie Gras.\n\nThe onion soup had a great cheesy crunch on the top and right when you dive your spoon in, you enter a heaven full of melted cheese, crunchy bread bits, and onion soup.

Any word that makes you want to reply with \"that's what she said.\"  I wasn't a big fan of lamb until I had this perfectly cooked meat. \n\nI had the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was juicy and tender.

No. But definitely up there. \n\nBoth my mom and bro got the Salmon for a healthier option and after trying them meats, it sure tasted healthy! It came crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  It was served with this spinach puree sauce I wished had a little more flavor so I decided to stick to my meat. \n\nOnto Dessert! Finally! \n- French Toast with soft caramel and hazelnut ice cream\n- Tahitian vanilla creme brulee\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, rum-raisin ice cream, caramel sauce.\n- Basil Napoleon maui pineapple, manilla mango, banana, kiwi & strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream\n\nFrench toast. ::drool::  Just get it.

I do wish the top was more crunchy, but it was light and not overly sweet.  \n\nHoly cow, did I need some milk for this Chocolate cake!  It was extremely rich and creamy.  Right when you pop that sucker out...warm chocolate oozes out so fast.

We all ended up getting our own three course meal with an appetizer, entree and dessert.  \n\nI, myself ordered a half dozen oysters for my appetizer, the Cassoulet de Toulouse for my entree, and the French Toast for dessert. We all tried to order different things so that we can sample each other's goodies. After we have all ordered and the server came to pour us our wine, the chef himself, Phillipe, came out to personally greet us! He was very friendly and even joked around with us... making the whole dinner and restaurant feel very warm and hospitable! DEFINITE PLUS!\n\nBefore our appetizers could come out, we were served toasty bread with butter, baked just right with the warm inside and crunchy outside: and it was refilled so often that it was hard to keep our hands off of it! Shortly after the bread, the appetizers came so  we then had a combo of oysters, the trio of salmon, traditional onion soup, and the Salade Landaise. Just to keep the review short.... everything was great, but the trio of salmon..... OMG! simply delicious! \n\nThen, onto the entrees, we recieved the Pan Seared Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, Filet Mignon, a Salmon dish that I can't remember the name of (menu changes every so often) and my Cassoulet de Toulouse. \nMy favorite was my own dish, the Cassoulet! I'm not usually a fan of lamb, but the reviews raved about it! I just had to try it... and I was definitely not disappointed!!! I also enjoyed my friend's duck dish a lot as well! \n\nFINALLY!... dessert. The guy sitting in the table next to our party was a usual and he highly recommended that we tried the french toast. He did such a great job advertising it as he ate his that our whole table ended up ordering the same dessert! Dear God.... it was orgasmic! The french toast was sweet with a light syrup glazed over the toast... adorned with powdered sugar, accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely perfect! \n\nAfter our meal, our bill came to us in a hat which i though was adorable since \"chapeau\" literally means \"hat\" in french! We stayed to chat after a while with the chef and he even met us outside to take a picture with us, and to wish my friend a happy birthday! So NICE!!!\n\nThis place is definitely a place to check out whether you're in the area or not. It might sound a little bit pricey, but for what you're getting (a quality 3 course meal),  it's obviously worth it! I'll most certainly be back to try all the new things on the next menu.

The salad was served with Fried Camembert and Pistachios and was quite large.  The sweetbreads can be served as either and appetizer or entree and I found it perfect as an appetizer.  It came about crispy yet lite with an excellent mushroom truffle sauce.  I opted for the small fish course which was a scallop served in a fish sauce with bulgur.  The scallop really missed and the bulgur just didn't need to be on the plate.  That being said, the fish sauce was a hit but probably could have worked better as a soup.  For entrees we ordered the Monkfish and Skatefish.  The monkfish was served over a pesto risotto and was perfectly cooked.  The Skate Wing was served in a Grenobloise sauce with fingerling potatoes.  I would recommend either of these fish dishes.  \n\nService:\nAlthough their seemed to be a large waitstaff, they seemed constantly unprepared and lost.  Our waiter didn't know the specials and didn't help very much in our food selections.  He always seemed to be bringing more silverware that didn't make sense.  He would come out with forks and then return a few minutes later with spoons, then knives, all separately.  Someone else ordered a steak to share with they brought out to show the table.  It was meant to be carved on a cart nearby but the cart had no knife.  They had to go back into the kitchen to find an appropriate knife while the steak got cold.  \n\nThe food should get 4 stars and the service 2, making my overall 3 stars.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-05-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The Mesclun Salad (excellent), the Petite Poussin (excellent), and the creme brulee (excellent).

I also had the pleasure of tasting the Escargot de Bourgogne in Butter-Parsley & Garlic Sauce, Trio of Salmon, and the Soup of the Day. All of which tasted pretty good. But overall, I really loved my salad!\n\nFor the main course I ordered the Louisiana Gulf Wild Flounder with\nmashed potatoes, braissed leeks, roasted tomatoes, and mussels in Saffron sauce. Chapeau! indeed!  The texture of the flounder was... I don't even know how to describe it! Oh! Like that of scallop and cod combined. I was very happy with my selection. The sauce was very cleverly made. I commend the chef for creating a sauce so light, but rich enough in flavor. I love finishing a dish without having the feeling that I overstuffed myself in the process.\n\nFor dessert I had the Basil Napoleon. The mixture of pineapple, mango, banana, kiwi and strawberries looked as festive as it tasted. I especially liked the Champagne-Citrus Pastry Cream. Not too sweet.

Bay Area\"... and that's the major reason my partner and I chose to celebrate my birthday there last night.  I love well prepared French cuisine: nouvelle or old-school, when it''s right, it's heaven.  What I saw on CPBA  convinced me it was worth an excursion. \n\nMore deciding factors in our choice of Chapeau included that escargot and duck breast be on the menu.  Bam!  \"Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic\", reads the menu, and that's what you get and then some.  I missed the novelty of the shells and hardware (I love props), but the baked escargot served in their own pools of clarified butter and an abundance of garlic and parsley was wicked... I had to make an effort not to fill myself up on baguette and the remainder of the tasty butter pools which would prevent me from enjoying the rest of the dishes to come.  The duck breast seemed to be made especially for me:  the medium rare was perfection; the duck breast succulent and tender.\n\nThe early bird special is a great choice if you plan on dining between 5 and 6 pm.  We wanted to get bang for our buck so we made reservations for 5:15 pm.  I'd online-researched a good Pinot Noir and picked up a bottle of Shea Vineyards, Oregon 2008 at K&L on 4th Street (fab place - unique wines and great staff knowledge and assistance).  Chapeau has an impressive wine list on its own, but again we were on bang-for-the-buck mode (isn't just about everyone these days) and with  Chapeau's corkage fee being $18, you can buy a mid- to expensive bottle of wine at retail, pay the corkage and avoid a 3-figure wine cost on your dinner bill.  I shared tastings with Philippe the owner and my waiter and they approved my choice.  \n\nOn that same theme, because the early bird / prix fixe menu is so affordable and it was my birthday afterall,  we ordered an additional starter for each of us: pan seared scallop on a little bed of pesto risotto served with a lobster reduction sauce.  It was charming and sublime.  A complete miniature dinner plate on its own, the scallop was hearty yet tender and flavorful; the risotto just the right side of al dente for my preference, and the lobster reduction a nice punctuation. Oh, and before I forget, I am a fussy and impatient diner, so I was disappointed to see the escargot and Philip's chestnut soup (excellent btw!) appear before the additional scallop appetizer we especially ordered.  We were told by our support waiter that the scallop would be served after the escargot which, I realized made much more sense for the sequence.  It was my bad wannabe gourmand party foul... and I appreciate the waiter's attention to detail. Not quite ready to jump into the Pinot Noir  I asked for a suggestion of white to go with the scallops.  The waiter seved me a perfectly paired Sancerre.\n\nAnd before I go on, there was a delightful amuse bouche of filet of anchovy in a bed of baked fio dough that we were served on the house before our meal began. \n\nAs I said, the duck breast was exactly the way I love it.  Philip's pork tenderloin was delectable.  And, as it was still my birthday dinner we again went bang-for-the-buck and each ordered an after dinner mesclun salad with a creme dijonnaise dressing, red seedless grapes, pistachio, fried camembert and toasted walnut bread.  A great way to change it up after your main course and before dessert.\n\nAs I dreaded, I was subjected to the happy birthday singing by the staff when my profiteroles came for dessert.  I'd expected something sinister when I saw Philip chatting with one of the waters at the door.  But the restaurant patrons joined in and sang sincerely and I was humbled and felt like I was really being feted.  \n\nI'm looking forward to my return to Chapeau!  The prix fixe menus starting at $38 for a three-course meal and $46 for four courses of your choice is sill a great bang-for-your-buck for outstanding French cuisine and service. \n\nBravo, Chapeau!

Then I moved on to the bacon wrapped pork loin. Sure, it would probably be difficult for this dish not to taste good - but it was especially so. I finished with a Nuage de Noix, which consisted of roasted pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly and Italian meringue. Yeah, I didn't know what it was either when I ordered it, but I sure am glad I did. Compliments of the chef, we also were offered a Basil Napoleon - not my thing, as I don't typically care for the new age dessert that consists of non-traditional spices and flavors, but interesting.\n\nAll of this was served in close quarters. Be aware that if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, I don't believe there is a spot in this restaurant for you. Tables are very closely packed. At first, I was a little taken aback by this, but it added to the charm of the place for me. Not everyone will agree.\n\nService was just a bit off. I overheard the table to my right complain about a couple of things - first the wine, then the preparation of the fish. Mind you, I think they were kind of...annoying. But the waiter didn't have quite the right response either time. Then he delivered their dinner to us - that certainly didn't help matters. And somehow still in the end, it wasn't sorted out when we each received the others' bill. I overheard the table to my left complain about the slow pace of service - and indeed, it at times seemed to move like a snail. I certainly felt that way when my tea never arrived and I had to ask for it after my husband had gotten his coffee. Other little things, like the wrong fork for salad, just gave the place more of an amateurish feel than it deserves.\n\nStill, this is an excellent value for excellent food.

Although I did  not taste my husbands duck salad he said he enjoyed it. For my entre I ordered the poussin which had bacon in the sauce.  I was concerned it would be greasy but that was certainly not the case. As with the salad I finished every drop!

Not PC but I have been wanting to try this culinary delight for a long time. And delightful it was. It was seared on the outside and very soft and smooth on the inside. Extremely rich, served with a piece of toast soaked in a sweet sauce, a side of microgreens and thinly sliced apples. Sooo good!\n\nFor entrees I ordered the halibut, which was served with a saffron and celery root broth with fennel, fettucine and a piece of crispy toast with smoked salmon paste. My boyfriend ordered the sauteed monkfish, which was served with risotto in a lobster bisque. Both dishes were nothing short of sublime. We have not had fish that perfectly cooked in a long long time, so moist and delicate. Just amazing.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the apple tart with hazelnut ice cream and a dollop of caramel, and the vanilla bean creme brulee. The creme brulee was perfection, and the tart was excellent, especially with the ice cream, which was bursting with hazelnut flavor and so damn good. \n\nThe service was superb, attentive without being overbearing. The restaurant is very cozy with some tables that are very close together. We asked to be moved to a table by the window, which the server obliged, and we enjoyed our meal happily and comfortably. \n\nThe owner/executive chef, Philippe Gardelle, greets everyone when they arrive, and graciously thanks and says goodbye to everyone as they leave with a handshake for the men and a European double kiss for women.

He helped us pick a Santenay pinot noir as a companion to our meal. The wine was flowery and not too heavy, with a flavor that easily permeated throughout the meal. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe about this restaurant is that they sat us VERY close to the next table. There was probably an inch of space between us. Our neighbors were also very loud (thanks to the level of noise in the room, you have to speak up to be heard across the table), which definitely detracted from my experience. Though the lighting is dark and the decor is romantically European, Chapeau! may not be the best location for a quiet, intimate dinner. \n\nI am a sucker for cute little perks like the glittery hat they place your bill in (chapeau means hat in French), and getting to meet the chef at the end of the meal. We left the restaurant somewhat abruptly, and the chef even chased us outside to make sure he got a chance to meet us.

I loved it.  Period.  I ordered up their Cassoulet de Toulouse, which was their braised lamb shoulder for the entree, and it was huge!  Nice and tender, that plate can surely fill 2 people.  If you can't finish that lamb entree (I don't blame you), do pack it to go!  They use foil for packaging and they shape the foil into a swan-like shape and it creates a handle for you to hold it!  Pretty creative over boxes!  Their Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with parsnip puree, was decent, but not the best entree, I would say.\n\nWe got lost in translation for the French desserts, so we asked our waiter which ones we should get.  He didn't steer us in the wrong direction at all.  Their Sauteed Fig in Red Wine Soup dessert, was one of a kind!  Something I have never tried before and worthy of getting!  The fig and wine with vanilla ice cream, complimented warmly with each other!  The taste of fig, vanilla blend and wine, was a wonderful mix that I would have not thought of stirring up!  As for their Tarte Du Jour, which the desciption was not on the menu, but just the name itself on the menu, was superb!  It reminded me of a chocolate puff pastry, but up it by times ten!

Unfortunately because this restaurant is pretty small and they were packed that night, we could not be moved to a larger table and had to accommodate 7 people at a table that was only sufficient for 6. It wasn't really the restaurants fault and both the hostess and our waiter were extremely attentive and accommodating, apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Dine About Town Menu was $34.95 for a three course pre-fixe meal. After taking a look at their regular menu, we all found it to be unnecessary. Chapeau offers their own pre-fixe menus for similar prices and your options are open to anything on the menu. It costs additional for certain items but well worth the cost.\n\nBetween the 7 of us, we sampled most of the entrees as well as a majority of the desserts. The food was delicious.

Nothing great and nothing bad.\nFilet Mignon: Fantastic, hearty meat with a deep rich sauce that was wonderfully soaked into the potatoes. The trumpet mushrooms add even more power to it.\nDuck Breast: This was my friends' favorite. The duck breast was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, with an excellent lightness to it. Would definitely order again.\nSkate Wing: SO GOOD. Fyi, a Skate is a type of ray so you're eating the meaty wing of it. The meat was soft like seafood would be but still had some texture to it. But mainly, the combined flavors of the skate, potatoes, capers, and sauce balanced so perfectly for such a unique and absolutely delicious entree. I definitely had trouble sharing this plate with everyone..  :)\n\nFor desserts, we got the French Toast, Creme Brulee, Chocolate Cake, and Sorbet Trio. All were perfectly done and tasted great, but the French Toast was exceptionally good. Salted Caramel ice cream oozing over warm French Toast is a definite winner.\n\nPriced at $45 for the 3 course menu, I would gladly go again for the relaxed atmosphere, amazing flavors, and good portions.\n\nAlmost forgot, the bread they serve is hot and crispy I must've eaten an entire loaf myself... so good!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-05-13"}, {"excerpts": ["My boyfriend got the Salade Landaise; the duck confit on it was amazing.

The server replaced it for us right away with no fuss. \n\nFor our entrees I got the salmon and my boyfriend got the filet mignon. The filet mignon was super tender and cooked perfectly. The knife sliced right through with ease. The mushroom sauce on it was also extremely good. Presentation was a little lacking as it was placed kind of off to the side of the plate; however it was delicious so whatever :-p. I did't like my salmon as much. The mussels that came with it were too salty and the hickory smoked salmon was way too hickory smoked for my liking. In fact, I felt the salmon was a little overdone. However, the mashed potatoes that came with the salmon were super good. \n\nDessert was one of my favorite parts of the meal! I ordered the amazing Nuage de Noix - soooo good. I loved the pistachio crumble on top as well as the walnuts throughout the lovely frozen cream. SO GOOD. My boyfriend ordered the Basil Napoleon which was very fragrant but no where close to what we though it'd be. We thought it'd be a napoleon ckae, with the alternating puff pastry and cream layers; it was more of a fruit salad with custard and wafers.   \n\nI think my overall conclusion is that the food gets to be pretty salty and service can be slow which is the only reason for the minus star.

In operation since the mid-90's up until its move to the Richmond in the fall of '09, Bay Area residents have been treated to the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" that frequently come out of the mouths of the anticipated sold-out crowds at this establishment as they peer down on their beautifully crafted plates as well as their neighbors'.\n\nIts no surprise to anyone that it requires one to make a reservation well in advance considering the space seats 49 (with an additional 12 at the bar), but Chef Philippe personally welcomes all of his patrons as if he was throwing a family dinner, every night, for a family of 49.  As you walk in, it feels as if you're immediately transported to another world (for those of you that have seen the movie \"Midnight in Paris\") by the charm and finesse of Gardelle and his well-trained staff.\n\nEven with reservations, there have been many times where there was a significant wait after the allocated time slot.  I don't blame them, it must be difficult to get people to leave their chairs here.  However, I never did mind the delay since the spacious bar is always stocked with a flurry of options for scotches, cocktails, and spirits I haven't seen anywhere else.  Its really a nice place to just have a pre-dinner glass of wine.\n\nI have never been a big fan of escargot but was willing to give it another shot with the traditional escargots de borgogne served in butter, parsley, and (yes!) garlic.

It really does excel compared to many steakhouses out there.  As such, it is usually an extra $6 to select this item on their prix-fixed menus but is well worth it.\n\nConclude your experience with the always refreshing trio of sorbet with hazelnut basket and apple compote, or one of my personal favorites, the tahtienne vanilla bean creme brulee, and you'll feel like you just had a meal fit for a king.\n\nJust to elaborate a bit more on the service, I will provide an example from one of my experiences dining here.  One time, my friend had accidentally knocked over a glass of wine on the table and immediately, several of the wait staff came over and started to clear everything off of the table.

Since the tables are so close together, we actually became friendly with them. \n\nWe both ordered the prix fixe menu 1. \nI had:\n- Salade Landaise: Fris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret, Fingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette\n- Wild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter, Fingerling Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, Banana Flamb\u00e9e & Rum-Raisin Ice Cream,\nCaramel Sauce \n\nThe hubby had:\n- the special foie gras\n- Cassoulet de Toulouse: Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder,\nDuck Leg Confit, Garlic & Toulouse Sausage \n- French Toast, Soft Caramel, Hazelnut Ice Cream \n\nThe server brought a complimentary roasted cauliflower soup which came in a demi tasse. Really good and was great with the warm bread and butter. \n\nThe chef came out to make his rounds and greeted everyone. Nice touch I thought. \n\nOur appetizers arrived and we really enjoyed them. I loved my salad and wished there were more duck in it. The hubby liked his foie gras too.\n\nOur neighbors got mussels and raved about them. \n\nThen we waited a REALLY long time for our entrees to come. Our neighbors got their entrees before we did. We were all a little shocked since we had arrived at least 30 minutes before them. \n\nOur server was no where to be found. \n\nWe not only were hungry since a lot of time had gone by since our appetizers but we just wanted to see how much longer it was going to be. Our neighbors were almost done with their food when we finally got a hold of our server who just came by and said \"I'll go check on your entrees\" and walked off. \n\nWe were actually thinking of leaving but decided against it since it was our anniversary. If we were anywhere else on any other day, we would have just asked for the check for the apps and been out. \n\nCouple of minutes went by and he came back to say \"They are working on them\" and walked off. Then we waited some more. By this time our neighbors were done with their entrees. I was not happy. \n\nWe finally got our entrees and even though I was hungry, my skate wing was just ok. My hubby did not like his dish at all. We thought the food would be amazing and it was just ok. It was very disappointing after waiting that long. \n\nOur neighbors and we started talking and we didn't like that our server was so nonchalant about our wait. A simple \"I'm sorry for the wait\" or any information or some sort of apology would have been nice. Even when he dropped off the entrees, he didn't say a word. If you're in a nice establishment, you expect a certain level of service and we just didn't get it. \n\nOur entrees were cleared and while we were waiting for dessert, the chef came by. I guess he heard about our wait and our conversation because  he apologized for it. He acknowledged that it's not only the food but the service that makes for a memorable dining experience. I really appreciated the apology and wish the server would have done something as well. If it was a mistake in the kitchen like the chef indicated, the server could have said so. \n\nWhen we got our desserts, he included an extra one which was; Nuage de Noix Roasted Pistachios, Almonds & Hazelnuts in a Frozen Chantilly & Italian Meringue. I had a candle on my cake too to celebrate our anniversary. It was a nice touch but maybe a little too late. \n\nBy that time we had been there for over 2 hours. We just wanted to finish eating and go home. \n\nWe just thought it was over hyped and maybe our experience wasn't the norm but it was enough for us to think about not going back which is sad because I should have tried the mussels.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-11-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Appetizers:\n\nSalade Landaise:\n"], "author": "Payal P.", "review": "This was one of the most magical dining experiences I've had in ages.

Bravo.\n\nThe sweetbread (a.k.a. cow thymus, or other glands.  Neither sweet, nor bread! =P) was again a very solid dish.  My advice, don't get it if you get the foie gras.  Very similar creamy, rich animal organ texture that was already achieved better with the foie gras.  Also, the sauce on the sweetbread is the same as what is on the Filet Mignon.  Our waiter told us in hindsight.  Although excellent, I would have passed on the sweetbread, had I known.\n\nOur bi-polar meal turns for the worst when our two Filet Mignon entrees arrive.  While tender like a newborn, our medium rare medallions were pink on the inside, but BONE DRY.  Our jovial conversation begins to transform into various synonyms for SAW DUST.  The limited sauce on the plate didn't make up for the meat's sandiness.  I look over at a neighboring table's Filet Mignon: the gentleman's plate was just as arid.  Not a drop of juice, blood, sauce, anything, the filet was a sponge.\n\nWith 3 out of 3 steaks being dry, I was convinced that if I complained, nothing would change about the Filet Mignon.  I suspect (though I am not sure) that the meat was over-aged, leaving little blood inside to moisten the meat.\n\nTo quench the drought on my palette, the bordeaux wine I had was adequate.  But at $13 for a meager pour, I was hoping for better.\n\nThe desserts allow Chapeau! to redeem itself.  The thinly sliced french toast had the crust removed and is drizzled in a light, caramelly/mapley sauce that I can't quite identify, and the Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream on top was decadent.  The french toast barely had any egg yolk flavor and you could tell that a lot of care went into making this dessert.  \n\nMy chocolate cake (lava cake style) was very good, but Roy's has perfected that dish and Chapeau fell short of Roy.  But the Rum ice cream paired with it was something special; as rich as it could be, and as full of Rum flavor as ice cream can hold.\n\nLike everyone says, the chef is a wonderful host and kisses my significant other on the cheeks on her way out.\n\nAll in all, bi-polar gastronomy gets the belly full, and gives the emotional centers of our brains a roller coaster ride.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The Salade Landaise would come with a big chunk of perfectly seared piece on top.

The Salade Landaise would come with a big chunk of perfectly seared piece on top. The foie gras they used to use was top notch also, it was either better quality or more expertly prepared than other restaurants.\n\nThe free bread here is amazing, as good if not better than any artisan bread you will find in the city. The butter is also good. It is very hard for me to not fill up on bread, but I've come to limit myself to 2 or 3 pieces. If I find myself asking for a extra basket of bread before the appetizer comes out, I've learned to cut myself off at that point.\n\nAs far as appetizers and entrees go, I actually can't go too much into depth on everything on the menu because I've always pretty much gotten the same exact thing: salade landaise (duck salad) and fillet mignon medium rare with bone marrow (the bone marrow is a recent addition to their menu).

If you end up getting the filet, it is $6 dollars in addition to the 3 course menu price of about $40 and the salad is 2 or 3 dollars in addition as well. The marrow will run you another 5.

"], "author": "Hao L.", "review": "Dined here on Mon Jan 4, 2010. Chapeau in French means a \"hat\", but as you may know, from the menu or other sources, adding an exclamation mark results in a new meaning of \"wow\". You could say \"c'est chapeau!\", the equivalent of \"bravo\" or \"hats off!\". And vraiment, that is what you will be saying by the time your experience, dining and otherwise, ends here. And your experience starts the minute you walk in the door, with jolly and convivial chef/owner Philippe Gardelle, who halls from Cotignac in Provence and never went to a culinary school, personally greeting you. Philippe and his wife Ellen opened Chapeau! in 1996 but in December 2007 they bought Clementine from owners Didier Labbe and Laurent Legendre, a space that used to house Alain Rondelli, and moved Chapeau! into the larger Clementine space in August 2009, which seats 49 plus 12 at the bar, compared to the old Chapeau!'s 35.  Decor is a bit sparse at the moment, the walls a comfortable yellow but unadorned. Having set the tone, from there the excellent staff take over and continue the outstanding personal service. Chapeau! offers an early bird 3 course prix fixe Sundays through Thursdays for $28 from 5 to 6 PM and which changes every two weeks. They also offer a 3 course prix fixe for $38, a 4 course prix fixe that adds a tasting fish for $46, and palate cleansers for an additional $4.50, the same as their a la carte price. There is also a vegetarian 3 course prix fixe for $38. My friend and I chose the 4 course prix fixe with the palate cleansers. The baguette bread brought to our table was warm and not too hard, two qualities which I was very pleased with. On each table was a little square glass candy dish with heart-shaped corners and peaked sides filled with red and green jingle bells, the kind you might find on a jester's hat, a very nice touch. Our meal began with an amuse bouche of white truffled cream of cauliflour soup, very nice. Initially, i had planned to get the deep-fried black tiger prawns with shredded phylo dough, tomato & onion marmalade, petits legumes, and herbed aioli, $13 a la carte, but upon hearing about the foie gras appetizer special, $18 a la carte, $6 with the prix fixe, I ordered it instead. The foie gras ($19.50) arrived on a square plate, pan-seared lobes arranged on toasted brioche pedestals, the bottom of the plate covered with thin zigzagging lines of apple gastrique. In the center a thinly sliced apple wedge stood straight up; at the bottom corner a manicured pile of peppery greens that cut the richness of the other elements. Stunning plating for an equally blissful dish. My friend had the salade Landaise (a reference to the Landes region in Aquitaine) with frisee, duck confit & smoked duck magret (the breast meat of the Moulard duck, known for its superior quality), fingerling potato chips, and classic French vinaigrette (white wine vinegar, shallots, salt, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and olive oil), $12.50 a la carte. Quite good. Next came the tasting fish: pan-seared dayboat scallop with lobster sauce on pesto risotto with basil pollen and tomato confit. The scallop was quite good, and the risotto especially so, absolutely perfect actually. I loved every bite. Next came the palate cleansers. I had the Trou Normand (French for \"Norman Hole\"), a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the apetite and make room for the next course. In this case it appropriately came with a matching green apple sorbet. My friend had the Colonel: a lemon-ginger sorbet with a citrus-infused vodka. Sorbet Colonel is usually a lemon sorbet drizzled with vodka. They were both very nice. For my entree, I chose the sauteed striped bass with Yukon gold mashed potato, fondue provencale (tomatoes, court-bouillon, kalamata olives), caramelized pearl onions, jus de poulet (chicken), basil oil, and fried leeks, $24 a la carte. Chef Philippe Gardelle came around to check on the food, and was kind enough to explain the ingredients in the fondue provencale. Fondue here means \"blended\" as oppose to \"melted\" or \"molten\". An excellent dish. My friend had the bacon-wrapped natural pork tenderloin with polenta puree, braised green swiss chard, and apple-calvados sauce. An exceptional dish. For dessert, I had the Basil Napoleon, with Maui pineapple, manilla [sic] mango, banana, kiwi, strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream, and Feuille de Bric (literally brick sheets, thin sheets of wheat flour, the term bric being etymologically linked to phyllo...), $8.50 a la carte. This was a very deconstructed Napoleon, not in the traditional stack, but just as delicious and easier to eat! My friend had the warm chocolate cake with banana flambee, rum & banana ice cream, and caramel sauce, $8.50 a la carte. He loved it.

It means wow in French. That is exactly how I felt throughout my whole experience at this establishment. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and I can most certainly say that it was an unforgettable experience.\n\nEven before we entered the restaurant, the host was so kind and friendly. He made us feel like we were walking into his home for a truly personal experience. After being seated and waiting a bit, our waiter, a quirky French gentleman, provided us with the menus and explained all of the specials for the night. I personally recommend choosing the 3 or 4 course pre-fixe menu just because the value is so much better, and you and your partner can try different things! The quality of service was absolutely superb. Waters constantly refilled, timely checkups to see how we were doing at the table, and even having our napkins folded when we went to use the bathroom added to the whole experience.\n\nAs for the food, there were definitely some highlights and must-gets:\n\nTrio of Salmon: Definitely a must-get! They made this dish so light and flavorful. The crispy capers added a nice crunch and saltiness to the extremely fresh salmon that was served. In addition, there was a hint of sweetness from the caviar and lemon dressing that rounded out the whole dish. \n\nVeal Sweetbreads: If you haven't had sweetbreads, then this is definitely the place to try them! They have a very savory taste, very similar to liver. The texture was slightly chewy but extremely tender, and the dark sauce and mushrooms that accompanied the dish were amazing.\n\nPan-Seared Day Boat Scallop: Probably one of the best scallops I've ever had. Like seriously. Try this dish.\n\nBouillabaisse: The broth was slightly salty for my taste, but all in all a great dish that contained a lot of fresh seafood and also some DELICIOUS gruyere on toast.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: This was okay. If you're a lover of smoked meats then I definitely recommend this to you. The duck was extremely tender and the sausage reminded me of Texas BBQ. The beans were also good as well, but definitely serve to fill you up quickly. \n\nChocolate Cake: I love chocolate molten cake so much, and this one was extremely interesting! There was a slight hint of rum in the cake that was a little too strong for me, but aside from that it was delicious.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: The best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had!

In retrospect, this was WAY more food than I ever wanted, but I'm glad we picked it if only for the delicious tasting fish. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the trio of salmon and salade landaise. The salmon was fresh, but I enjoyed the duck salad quite a bit more. The different versions of duck (smoked duck breast, duck confit, and duck liver pate) in the salad were all wonderfully flavored, and the frisee provided a good complement and palate cleanser for all the different tastes. The potato chips on top were a nice touch, too. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" ended up being a delectable scallop surrounded by a creamy pesto risotto. Probably the best part of the meal, to be honest -- highly recommend!  \n\nOur entrees were the skate wing and the cassoulet de toulouse.

Chapeau is still a popular place that gets booked up quickly.  I was lucky to be able to get a reservation with three days notice, and an earlier time slot (5PM), the night before.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy but not as small as you would think.  The place was pretty bustling towards the end of dinner and we could see why.  We were the second party to be seated, and I honestly would have preferred another table than the one we got, but I guess that's okay.  Because it was Restaurant Week, Chapeau didn't offer their Early Bird Dinner, which in actuality is a better value than the Restaurant Week menu.  Since foie gras was back I decided on doing the seared foie gras appetizer ($20) and for my entree the duck frisee salad ($16).  He stuck with the Restaurant Week menu and chose: the trio of salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and the Basil Napoleon.  \n\nFirst came out the amuse bouche which was a sort of anchovy breadstick, first bite, it was just a salty breadstick, then came in the fishy anchovy taste.  He was fine with it, for me, I just couldn't do another bite.  The foie gras mas magical!  He said it was the best foie gras he ever had - even compared to Gary Danko's and Au Cheval's foie gras scrambled eggs.  It was nicely seared and fatty.  The apple slices were the perfect sweet accompaniment.  The trio of salmon was so fresh and light.  Loved the tartare and the creme fraiche and herbs complimented this well.  My frisee came with lots of tender duck confit and duck breast pieces.  I wished it would have came with a little more than duck and the frisee; even a little bit of citrus would have tied everything together and added a wonderful missing element to the dish.

I think it's a perfect dessert for someone who isn't much into sweets.  \n\nI think Chapeau is almost at 5.

The city is full of amazing restaurants so choosing can be difficult. Luckily it coincided with date night with my girlfriend and she suggested that we check out Chapeau! for a lovely, romantic meal. Problem solved!\n\nThe meal started innocuously with a super flavorful, crusty bread with butter that had just enough salt. An amuse bouche of cauliflower soup was served, which would actually become my favorite dish I had all night. It was perfectly seasoned and finished off with a drop of truffle oil. (Truffle oil is one of those ingredients that is somewhat looked down upon by master chefs since it is basically just a manufactured aromatic and not actually a truffle-infused oil. While I wouldn't serve it to Chef Ramsey, I do enjoy a drop or two in my favorite dishes.)\n\nFor our first course, my girlfriend and I enjoyed their trio of salmon and a creamy yellow corn soup.  The salmon was served as stack with gravlax, tartare, and caviar, with egg mimosa, fried capers, and creme fraiche and the soup was served with a deep fried crab cake and white truffle oil.  The salmon dish was fantastic and each component builds on top of the flavor of the last.  The whole dish comes together in a single bite.  The soup was super refreshing and paired perfectly with the crab cake.  I could have done without the drizzle of truffle oil in this case, but it did add a rich dimension to the soup.\n\nOur main courses included the cassoulet de toulouse and oven roasted wild atlantic salmon.  The cassoulet was served with canellini beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, and garlic and toulouse sausage, while the salmon came with a fondue provencale, fennel confit, parsley oil, and roasted bell pepper sauce.  The cassoulet was rich and the sausage was delicious, and the meat fell right off the bone of the duck leg.  It might have been a tad over-seasoned but the dish was otherwise executed very well.  The salmon was cooked to medium-rare, something I didn't know was possible.  I loved it, and that's how I'm going to cook mine from now on.  It was perfectly seasoned and light, tender, and amazing.  The components combined to make the perfect summery bite.\n\nFor dessert we shared the nuage de noix and baked alaska.  I really liked both desserts with the nuage de noix being filled with roasted pistachios, almonds, and hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly and italian meringue in an orange soup.  I happen to love nuts and this combination really hit the spot.  I felt like I was eating the world's most special oatmeal cookie.  The baked alaska featured a sponged rum cake, coffee ice cream, italian meringue, chocolate sauce, and candied toasted almonds.  The baked alaska lacked the theater of the San Diego version, but was fantastic nonetheless.  The dark chocolate and rum sauce was to die for and all together a heavenly way to end the meal.\n\nService here was fantastic, with attention to detail starting the moment you walk through the door.  Even the chef came out to say hi, and everybody was just so darn nice.  I enjoyed the entire meal and there were high notes in each course.  If you go, definitely get the salmon and nuage de noix.  It was a fantastic place for a date dinner and I encourage you to bring your loved ones here for a fantastic evening.\n\nFood: 9/10\n\nService: 10/10\n\nPrice: $$$\n\nAtmosphere: 9/10", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend had the trio of salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin,  and their fabulous nuoge de noix .

What a warm welcome :\n\nMost of us opted for the 4 course option. Our waiter brought us a chilled sorbet-liked 'soup' which is said to have palate-cleansing power, served in an espresso size cup. Not sure if our palates were cleansed but the bread that they served while we waited for our appetiser was indeed heavenly with a hint of garlic, soft on the inside but crispy on the outside.

I had a sample of the mussel & it was delectable too, especially when the bread soaked up all the delicious goodness.\n\nFor the 'fish tasting' it is a pan-seared scallop sitting on a bed of risotto. My scallop was cooked just right but some of the others were slightly over-cooked. The risotto, to me came in slightly under-cooked as I could still bite into the crunchy bits. Next was the much anticipated entree. My left brain had to fight with my right brain... duck or lamb, duck or lamb, duck or lamb... I decided on the 'Special' - lamb-shank. Verdict??? I was disappointed.. what?!?!?!?! yup, you heard me right. DISAPPOINTED!!! It was too salty and the sauce was too sweet for my liking. As none of us ordered the duck, I am still intrigue as to how that would turn out. Maybe that's my excuse to go back there in future\n\nThe most important course of the dinner was of course dessert ;) With 8 of us ordering desserts, I had a chance to sample the Baked Alaska (ice-cream with rum cake), creme brulee and the french toast. French toast top the list. Bummer that I only had just one teeny-weeny bite *sigh*\n\nOn our way out, Philippe was at the door, cheek kissing us gals. Didn't pay attention if the guys shake hands or cheek kissed as well.\n\nWith all the highs & lows, it was overall an enjoyable experience.

The mussels were steamed with white whine, shallot and parsley, which came along with a side of pommes frites. Yum! I had been already full from my salad, so I ate all the mussels and saved my fries for to go. The white wine sauce was soo yummy that I asked for more bread to dip and eat it. \n\nWild Caught Skate Wing - Never heard of this dish before, but my dad had this and it was a pretty big portion! I could tell that it was very soft and tender and very flavorful by the looks of it!\n\nBoneless Roasted Half Chicken Dodine Stuffed with Mousse of Veal - My mom had this and I remembered she was really full and had packed this to go! \n\nFrench Toast, Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Creme Anglaise - I was already so full from my main course, but I just had to save room for dessert.

Yes, right when we entered, we were greeted by the welcoming hostess and the chef which was awesome! But the rest of our time there consisted of: our server quickly taking down our order, people just dropping off our food without any clear details of what each course was, no water refills for about 20 minutes of my boyfriend's cup being completely empty, absolutely no check ups or asking us if we enjoyed the food/needed anything else, and a long time to receive our bill. Don't get me wrong, the staff was extremely friendly, but the service wasn't as great as we had read. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was delicious!

Bone marrow was a little bit on the salty side, but still delicious. I forgot to also mention that the boyfriend and I both had a glass of wine, but sadly I can't remember the name. Our server chose for us because he said it pairs well with filet mignon and he was so right.\n\n** Desserts! I got the Baked Alaska and my boyfriend the French Toast.

My boyfriend's french toast was great as well. \n\nI did write down it was my boyfriend's birthday on opentable, but I guess they forgot..

So the sweetie that my bf is, he remembered I wanted to try this place and booked it as a random surprise for me. Lesson learned: make a reservation in advance!!\n\nYou can order a la carte or from their \"Menu options.\" Meaning either a 3 or 4 or 5 course meal. And the nice thing is, both people do NOT have to do the same option, whereas some places will dictate that you need to. So I got a 3 course ~$40 (choose your own appetizer, entry, dessert) and my bf got the 4 course ~$50, which included a tasting fish. Some options you may have to add a few extra dollars for that choice.\n\nFor appetizers, we got the trio of salmon and the corn soup. The salmon trio was yum!! And very pretty. I love fried capers too. Now, the bf picked the corn soup because there the word \"giant prawn\" in the description, but really...there was only one giant prawn and the rest was corn soup. HAHA...howeverrrr....I thought the soup was absolutely delicious! I love creamy corn soups and this was just the right consistency and sweetness. He was upset there was only one prawn haha\n\nThe tasting fish was a sort of scallop dish. TBH, I couldn't understand the thick French accent of our waiter for the life of me. All I heard were the words \"scallop\" and \"mango\"...which is a weird combination. But this scallop looked kind of like it was deconstructed and flattened. Topped with mango cubes, parsnips, some crunchy nut (maybe hazelnuts...) SOUNDS WEIRD I KNOW. You just had to try it. It was pretty damn good.\n\nEntrees, we got the roasted duck breast and Cassoulet de Toulouse--which had canellini beans,  lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, garlic & toulouse sausage. Roasted duck breast was really tender, the veggies and polenta with it were good...I thought it was better than the one we had at Redd in Napa.

Walking in the decor is lovely but the noise level here really takes always from the ambiance. When I think French, I think romantic and intimate not clamorous, annoyance. That being said our server had great knowledge of the menu and actually warned my girlfriend about one of their unique dishes (cassoulet the Toulouse). However, what really rubbed me the wrong way was all the additional charges that came with each menu item. Yes, if you are thinking $44.50 for a pre-fixed is too good to be true, you are absolutely correct. Almost all the good menu items were an additional $2-$8 some were even an extra $20. What's the point of even having a pre-fixe menu at that point?\n\nThe food was about average for me. Nothing really stood out.

When we arrived, we were greeted by none other than Executive Chef Philippe himself (although I did not know who he was at that time!). With a welcoming smile and handshake, he immediately escorted us to our table. After a server came to explain to us how the menu worked, we decided to order \"Menu 2,\" which was the 4-course menu.\n\n*FOOD*\nI ordered the French onion soup (appetizer), scallop with basil risotto (tasting fish), filet mignon (entree), and french toast w/ salted caramel ice cream (dessert). We also got complimentary dishes (which I will mention in the \"Service\" section below)! To start off, the soup was perfect! The scallop dish was simply exquisite, especially the risotto which I am obsessed about (it wasn't too creamy nor too dry). I pretty much had to hold back tears at that point, hah! I do wish the dish consisted of more than one scallop, though. As for the filet mignon, although the meat came out to be medium rare as requested, it was slightly chewy and not as tender as other filet mignons I've had where the meat easily sliced away with a knife. It wasn't anything bad, but it was not the best piece of filet mignon I've had - the potato and mushroom accompaniment were very good though! As for dessert, it was the best French toast I've ever had (and what they recommended too)! The salted caramel ice cream that came with the toast really balanced out the taste of the French toast and although the dessert sounds super sweet, it really wasn't overwhelmingly sweet at all!\n\n\"J\" pretty much had the same courses as me, except for his trio of salmon (appetizer) and trio of sorbet (dessert). The trio of salmon was delicious and a must-have if you like raw fish. The trio of sorbet was nothing special so I suggest choosing another dessert that's more worthwhile.\n\n*DECOR/AMBIANCE*\nThe restaurant itself is rather small and the decor is nothing spectacular, but if you want a place where you can have a quiet conversation with someone, this might not be the place. It was actually quite loud in the restaurant seeing how each table/group is only about a foot or two away from each other. We fortunately sat next to a very nice man who was dining alone and had a lovely conversation about the food with him. (= The couple who sat to our other side, however... they would not STOP MAKING OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. I tried so hard not to throw up my precious food that was happily sitting in my stomach. I've never seen anyone PDA to this extent at an upscale restaurant. Even the group next to them whispered among themselves about it. So as a side note to the couple who sat at the corner back table on 11/23: please get yourselves a room far, far away from here.\n\n*PRICE*\nA little over $50 for a high-quality 4-course meal? What more do you want?!\n\n*SERVICE*\nThe service here is what really shined the most on top of its excellent dishes. As I mentioned earlier, I initially didn't know that the man who escorted us to our table was in fact the main chef of the restaurant. That alone says a lot about the restaurant, when the main chef performs \"normal\" duties like other staff members. I finally realized who he was when he stopped by our table after we ordered to talk about his new \"fake\" foie gras creation, which he explained with such passion and charisma and in which he was very proud of! Surprisingly, after the convo, Philippe went into the kitchen and brought out complimentary faux foie gras for us to try (it was so smooth and tasty)! Another reason why I think the service here was excellent is because no matter how late you stay to finish your meal, you never feel rushed to leave nor do they forcefully try to make you leave. We arrived at 9pm and did not leave the restaurant until a bit after 11:30pm even though the restaurant officially closed at 10pm. While we were enjoying our desserts well after 10pm, Philippe came by our table once again to check up on us and then as he walked away from us, he shouted towards the kitchen something in French and a few minutes later, out came another dessert dish which were \"compliments from the chef\"! All of the other staff members were courteous and on-point when it came to refilling water, etc. (someone even came by to fold my napkin at the table when I went to the restroom). As we were about to leave the restaurant, Philippe stopped us at the bar area and cheerfully \"demanded\" that we give him hugs and kisses (first time I ever kissed a chef on the cheek! Oh, the French!). My only regret is that we didn't take a picture with him - he is so passionate about food and so down-to-earth, and his laugh is absolutely contagious! Thank you for everything, Philippe!\n\nThis is my new favorite French restaurant! I definitely will be coming back.

I really enjoyed the profiteroles as they were basically creme puffs but they were not extremely rich as they were also covered in melted dark chocolate. To me, the lemon tart was extremely sour but it could have also been since I had already taken bites from the creme brulee. Both my co-workers enjoyed it though.\n\nThe waiter was very patient with us as we tried to settle the number of people in our group since many canceled on us.

Best part was that it wasn't overly salty like most onion soups.  One step closer to obesity? Perhaps.  Delicious?  Oh, you know it, baby.\n\nThe Trio of Salmon had a beautiful presentation.  The smoked salmon was light and complimented well with the dressing.  I actually really enjoyed the little fried capers sprinkled around, it gave a nice texture to everything.\n\nNow the only appetizer that was slightly disappointing was the crab cake with tomato bisque.  I like my crab cake extra crispy but the ball came a little soggy since it was placed in the tomato bisque.  However, the crab and the tomato bisque had a great consistency.

Then came the fish tasting course which was a Seared scallop that evening.  My scallop was cooked nicely although the risotto was a bit salty.  I had the Striped bass & braised ox tail for entree & that was the most disappointing dish of the evening.  The filets were a bit fishy, there was this 1 tiny bite of ox tail hidden in the dish, & the sauce was strangely sour in a way that my palette is not accustomed to.  The best thing about the dish was the mashed potato which was really rich, creamy, & buttery good.  I ended with a French toast which I adored.

So lucky and no waiting so far.\n\nI liked the decor of the restaurant.  Very warm and cozy.  The service was great.  Everyone was so welcome, professional and efficient.  \n\nMy friend and I got the four courses tasting menu.  You could choose from one appetizer, one entree, one dessert from the regular menu.  And also a tasting fish dish for the day.  The tasting fish for that night was scallop risotto.  It was pretty good.  The presentation of the dish was nice.  The sauce was rich and creamy.  The scallop was so fresh but it was little salty to me.  \n\nFor appetizer, I got the trio of salmon and my friend got Porcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads.  I liked the salmon a lot.  Very refreshing and good flavors.  The sweetbread was Little heavy to me and filling.  It was mushrooms, baby carrots\nand turnips with truffle sauce.  \n\nI picked Black Bass, Thai Snapper, Monkfish, Mussels & Manila Clam for my entree.  The presentation was not as good as other dishes.  Fish was way to salty.  I did not even finish it.  But the Pork Tenderloin that my friend picked was very good.  The pork was tender and flavorful but not over salty.  I especially liked the apple sauce.  It was a perfect combination.  \n\nFor dessert, I got the French Toast and my friend got the warm chocolate cake.  The french toast was ok, not too impressive.  The chocolate cake was very good.  Very rich.  Too bad we were kinda full by that time and could not finish it.  \n\nOverall, I had a great dinning experience here.

A single scallop...and this made our prix fix an additional $9...) on a bed of pesto and creamy rice in a sea of lobster cream sauce.

My cassoulet was really delicious and came in a huge portion, but at this point I could barely eat any of it because I had gotten 3/4 full from the previous 2 dishes and the bread! It came with shredded lamb and beans in kind of a stew and the duck confit. I think that it was a little salty for my taste but still overall delicious!\n\nDessert:\nI got the chocolate cake (DIVINE) and my boyfriend got the apple tart.

The pool of white wine sauce was tooooo salty. The cropped herb was way too much and overpowered the taste of mussels. The combination caused the mussels too salty and grassy. \n\nThe fries and sauce that came with the mussels were great, but the presentation needed help. The fries were put in a paper & wire cone rack. Usually only big pieces of fries or fried food would use such a big cone rack. Tiny pieces of fries like theirs got lost in the cone.

That fried leeks was NO GOOD. It was greasy and tasted greasy. It's not crispy; it's tough to work with. By the time you can swallow the other elements, you'd still need to continue to chew on it. \nSalty & greasy. The truffle sauce was on the heavy greasy side. It tasted like their almost poured back the oil they used to sear the sweetbreads onto the plate. The sweetbreads absorbed the grease and gave me that heavy greasiness to the stomach. I went to the vegetables, expecting the baby carrots and turnips would help lightening the grease. The baby carrots were OK, but the turnips were way too salty. After that, I need to go for water to chase down the salt and grease. I could only finish 2/3.

Again, it tasted like the oil that they used to cook the meat were poured back onto the dish. It caused the meat tasting greasy. The grease was absorbed by the potatoes on the plate, causing the potatoes tasted greasy as well. The skill of cooking this steak should still be refined. The dish did not perform as well as a filet mignon dish should be. \n\n\nIf they look at our order, we didn't order much wine.

However, Chapeau demystifies all these myths.  \n\n2 years later, I find myself back at Chapeau, this time at their new location; at the old Clementine.\n\nCame here last Thursday w/ reservations and it was PACKED! It seemed like a Saturday night. Although we were late for our reservations, we were promptly seated. \n\nAs we walked to our table, we were warmly greeted by the Executive Chef/Owner. Nice way to begin a good meal!\n\nFOOD:\n*Amuse Bouche of Cauliflower Soup: This was a perfect start to our meal esp when it was very cold out that night. The soup was creamy and smooth. Cauliflower can be very bland, but the soup was well seasoned to bring out the natural flavor of the cauliflower. \n\n*Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche/Micro Herbs with Lemon Dressing: MmMm! Essentially, it was fresh salmon tartar wrapped in smoked salmon and surrounded by salmon roe. The combination of flavors was amazing--Salmon roe: saltiness and zing, gravlax: smokiness, cr\u00e8me fraiche: creaminess, and tempura bits: crunch. Talk about flavor and texture explosions in your mouth.  \n\n*Bacon wrapped Veal Lion with Truffled Soft Polenta and Spinach: The veal was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Although we didn't see much bacon (perhaps it fell off), it did it's job by seasoning the veal just enough to bring out it's meaty flavor. The veal was very tender; the texture was pretty similar to what I would expect from a filet mignon but softer. I normally cringe when I hear of polenta, but my GAWD...the truffled polenta was TO DIE FOR. It was creamy, smooth, and rich. My how truffles can do wonders for a dish.\n\n*French Toast w/ Caramel Sauce and Hazelnut Vanilla Ice Cream: I'm normally not a dessert person, but I always like to order desserts when going out to a nice restaurant to see how well-rounded the place is. And, in this case the dessert is the reason why I didn't give Chapeau 5 Stars. It was toasted white bread (didn't taste the egg mixture) soaking in caramel sauce and topped w/ hazelnut vanilla ice cream. I was disappointed... the bread quickly got soggy from sitting in the caramel sauce and the ice cream. The caramel sauce was not what I expected it to be; it was very watery and milky. And, the ice cream had a very faint hazelnut taste. \n\nSERVICE: Impeccable. Our waiter who was the same waiter I has 2 years ago was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. He recommended a great California Pinot to go with our meal which was perfect. It wasn't too dry or too strong which complemented the meat well. Although we stayed there for over 3 hours and they were closing, they never rushed us.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: I actually prefer Chapeau's new location on Clement and 2nd. Upon entering in, there is a new bar area. And, the dining room is larger and the tables aren't so close together; MORE elbow room! It's very simple with hardwood floors, tan tables and chairs and crisp white table clothes. Because the place is always packed, it may be a little difficult to easily hold a conversation.\n\nCROWD: Older crowd with a handful of people in their 20s on dates. \n\nPRICES: I think Chapeau's prices are quite fair for French food. Both times, I did the menu 1 for $38 (which hasn't changed) and includes the app, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. If you opt for the foie gras, it's an additional $6, the veal or filet, an additional $6. \n\nI plan to come back very, very soon for the Prime Rib for 2 served carved table side with Bone Marrow!!! *DROOL*", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-09"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the trio of salmon as appetizer.

And if you're lucky enough to have Pascal as your waiter, then you'll have an enjoyable exploration of French cuisine, with perfectly timed explanations, yet unobtrusive table service - exactly what a waiter should be. The ambiance is cosy, and unpretentious, lacking art on the walls, for instance.

The point is to be accommodating.  You can choose from tasting menus that include full portions of 3 or 4 plates, or smaller portions of many plates of the chef's choosing.  However, you can still order single, full-size items, by just picking appetizers and entrees.  \n\nThe amuse bouche was a cup of asparagus cream soup, heavy in salt, but very aromatic and tasty.  I had the trio of salmon as appetizer. It was a very fatty, soft raw salmon, plated with some salmon eggs, crumbled hard boiled eggs and a light dressing of creme fraiche. It was divine.\n\nNext came the entre-act of a single scallop on a bed of green risotto in a brown creamy sauce.

Who doesn't like a hint of bacon on their food? I was happy to see it didn't overpower the pork. The gratin dauphinois and spinach was interesting because it was on the sweeter side. \n\n+ Apparently the Skate Wing is a fish.

The shellfish was sparse with only a few clams and mussels while the three types of fish filet were overloaded.

The filet was cooked just right, although, in true French style, they put a little bit more sauce on it than I would have preferred. The bone marrow was pure fatty heaven, though, and was great on the fresh bread that was served before the meal. The seafood of the day was a pan-seared scallop with risotto and lobster sauce. Not the best risotto I've had, nor the best scallop, but both were done above average. By this point, we were pretty stuffed and decided to pass on some of the more aggressive dessert choices (like the chocolate cake, which read deliciously) and stuck with the trio of sorbets and the French toast. The sorbets were all fresh and a good diverse selection, but the French toast was the highlight for me - it's drizzled with caramel and is paired with a rich hazelnut ice cream. I'm a huge fan of French toast to begin with, but I've had a lot of variants as of late, and I really like what they did with it for dessert.\n\nAll in all, the meal was fantastic.

The expressions on our faces when that cake just POPPED open was hilarious.\n \nOne bottle of good wine and a glass each of Macallan 18 on the rocks (that Archie bought for me, and Chapeau allowed us to drink by bringing us wine glasses and ice - they do not serve hard alcohol here, FYI) -  we left, stuffed to the gills, toasty as can be, and off for more adventures in SF.\n \nWhat a romantic, spectacular and outstanding dinner this was...

I'm sure you want to know my total bill and it was roughly $160 after tax & tip.\n\nThey sat us down and took about 10 minutes to get bread to us to munch on, while they attended to different customers. We stared at the menu and were pretty elated at what they had to offer. We ordered a bottle of wine for $37 and I thought that was a decent price. A bottle of champagne was 60+ and other wines (red and white) were rougly $40-50. \n\nThey started us off with freshly baked bread and it was toooo good. They gave us a sample of their asparagus soup and I wanted like 10 more cups considering the cup they gave it to us was smaller than an expresso cup.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nESCARGOT - Shelled and ready to go! Awesome! It was served ontop of scalloped potatoes and the flavor was just right.\n\nTRIO OF SALMON - Interesting. I didn't find 3 different types of prepared salmon in there but it was pretty good so I didn't complain.\n\nSWEETBREADS - I've never had sweetbreads before but if you think it's bread that's sweet, it's not. Haha. It's the thymus glands of some animal, I forget. The texture of sweetbreads compares to really really really soft chicken. This was paired off with a sauce that was pretty salty and mushrooms. I would order sweetbreads from here again.\n\nDUCK ENTREE - The fattiest duck I've ever had. We ordered it to be cooked at medium and there was so much fat on there I felt like I was going to chew forever. Two duck breasts sat ontop of mashed potatoes (which were good) and topped off with fruits: grapes, figs, pears. \n\nFILET MIGNON ENTREE - NO NO NO. I should have sent this plate back and have them recook it. We had it done medium since that's how I like most of my steaks cooked. In other words, I don't want it bloody. The first half of the filet mignon was pretty good, but the second half was mushy. MUSHY. It mushed around in my mouth and if you were to ask me, It didn't taste like beef. It was slightly disgusting and I was pretty disappointed. The potatoes and mushrooms that it came with on the other hand were delightful. I could go for a big bowl of that, but not the filet mignon. \n\nCREME BRULEE - THEY RAN OUT!!!?!?!??!?!?!?! I was SO sad. But they did have pumpkin creme brulee which we did try and that was interesting. We ended up just eating the sugared part on top, haha\n\nAPPLE CUSTARD TART THING - Served with hazelnut icecream, YUM! This was pretty good. Better than the creme brulee.\n\nOverall, slightly disappointed and 160 dollars poorer.

The chef brought the near-finished product to our table to show us the 2+ pounds of deliciousness. Then, he whisked it aside to a cutting table where he cut and plated the dishes in front of us. It was fun to watch but MORE fun to eat. \n\nAs an added touch, they also served the bone marrow (still inside the bone-- you use a special spoon to scoop out the fatty marrow... I admit, this was a little overwhelming for me!). We were surprised (in a pleasant way) by the very bold flavors in the Roquefort sauce. The black truffle/ pepper sauce was more subtle but just as delicious. \n\nThe special comes with the gratin and chard on the side (more than enough for two people). We had a nice, slow meal progressing from the smoked trout amuse-bouche to the trio of salmon appetizer to the cote de beouf to the profiteroles! Perfection!! \n\nUNASSUMING LOCALE: \nChapeau! is a simple yet elegant neighborhood restaurant in the RICHMOND! It is cozy and unpretentious. I mean, it's in the Richmond... not the Mission, not Downtown, but the RICHMOND... just down the street from truly dirt-cheap Chinese diners. The atmosphere was conducive for hubby and me to start chatting up the staff and other diners. I loved it!\n\nAWESOME STAFF: \nThe owner/chef Philippe is hands-on to say the least; he greeted everyone in the house, helped out with diners' drink choices, etc., etc... The super-attentive waiters even learned it was my birthday, informed Philippe, and treated us to complimentary profiteroles! \n\nAt the end of the evening, Philippe sent us off with a handshake/ double cheek-kiss.

Man.. if it wasn't for her and her 23d (and yelp of course) I would have never knew about this place! \n\nParking was the ONLY thing that wasn't perfect about this dining experience... and to be honest.. it wasn't even that bad. Took me 5 minutes! And of course.. me and my friends are never on time... but they called in and they pushed our reservation back half and hour to give us time to all get there... no questions asked!\n\nSo once all 10 of us arrived.. we were promptly seated and a very friendly waiter came to explain and translate everything on the menu. We all ended up getting our own three course meal with an appetizer, entree and dessert.  \n\nI, myself ordered a half dozen oysters for my appetizer, the Cassoulet de Toulouse for my entree, and the French Toast for dessert. We all tried to order different things so that we can sample each other's goodies. After we have all ordered and the server came to pour us our wine, the chef himself, Phillipe, came out to personally greet us! He was very friendly and even joked around with us... making the whole dinner and restaurant feel very warm and hospitable! DEFINITE PLUS!\n\nBefore our appetizers could come out, we were served toasty bread with butter, baked just right with the warm inside and crunchy outside: and it was refilled so often that it was hard to keep our hands off of it! Shortly after the bread, the appetizers came so  we then had a combo of oysters, the trio of salmon, traditional onion soup, and the Salade Landaise. Just to keep the review short.... everything was great, but the trio of salmon..... OMG! simply delicious! \n\nThen, onto the entrees, we recieved the Pan Seared Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, Filet Mignon, a Salmon dish that I can't remember the name of (menu changes every so often) and my Cassoulet de Toulouse. \nMy favorite was my own dish, the Cassoulet! I'm not usually a fan of lamb, but the reviews raved about it! I just had to try it... and I was definitely not disappointed!!! I also enjoyed my friend's duck dish a lot as well! \n\nFINALLY!... dessert. The guy sitting in the table next to our party was a usual and he highly recommended that we tried the french toast. He did such a great job advertising it as he ate his that our whole table ended up ordering the same dessert! Dear God.... it was orgasmic! The french toast was sweet with a light syrup glazed over the toast... adorned with powdered sugar, accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely perfect! \n\nAfter our meal, our bill came to us in a hat which i though was adorable since \"chapeau\" literally means \"hat\" in french! We stayed to chat after a while with the chef and he even met us outside to take a picture with us, and to wish my friend a happy birthday! So NICE!!!\n\nThis place is definitely a place to check out whether you're in the area or not. It might sound a little bit pricey, but for what you're getting (a quality 3 course meal),  it's obviously worth it! I'll most certainly be back to try all the new things on the next menu.

Crazy huh? \n\nBut oh this place is so incredibly darling. We tried here on a whim with a call Saturday night looking for last-minute open seats (usually an impossible task). He offered to save two seats at the bar and once off the phone we cabbed right over. \n\nThe restaurant was small and signage not clear from the street due to a huge tree at the front sidewalk. But the warm yellow tones, glimpse of white tablecloth, dark orange droplights over the bar, and tons of happy faces clustered around tables and engaged in avid conversation made us sure we had found the right place. \n\nThe owner/chef Philippe Gardelle is amazing. I find it incredible that after 10+ years he still maintains an energy and charisma that continues to permeate this place and make it so enchanting. He makes a point to welcome every guest that arrives at the door, but still manages to have a hand on all the dishes and desserts and even the wine that appear on the menu. He walks through the dining room, ensuring everyone has everything they need, and he is extra sure to bid them goodbye and help them call a taxi if they need it before they leave. As things calm down towards the end of service he even wipes down the outside covers of every single menu and makes sure the pages are secured. \n\nOn top of that, the food is divine and affordable for French fare without the stuffiness. You can make your own 3-course dinner for $38 (a little extra if your entree is seafood), 4-courses for $46, with a sorbet between appetizer & entree at $50.50. Come as an early bird and order between 5-6pm (excludes Fri & Sat) and the 3-course is $28. There are also plenty of affordable good wines under $40. \n\nThe \"Trio of Salmon\" was absolutely luxurious with salmon tartar wrapped by a ring of salmon gravlax, surrounded by a circle of creme fraiche and salmon roe, again by an outer ring of crispy fried capers and fluffy little bits of soft-boiled egg, and topped with microgreens and a crispy thin latticed chip. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" that came only with the four-course selection was diced stewed tomato and sprouts atop a perfectly cooked scallop resting on basil-green risotto and a ring of creamy lobster sauce. It was like living \"Ratatouille\", where each individual component was a little spark of light in my mouth that exploded into fireworks when mixed together. \n\nThe \"bouillabaisse\" was a clean and rich-flavored broth with two fish fillets in the center and four mussels around it. Served with crisp croutons made of french bread and two little side bowls of smoky rich aioli, shredded cheese. The \"Cassoulet de Toulouse\" used dried and reconstituted cannellini beans which gave a great texture, duck leg confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and a little toulouse sausage. It was really rich and comforting for the cold winter night although a little too salty. \n\nThey offer two palate cleansers in the form of sorbet served in a little triangle bowl with a shot of liquor poured in. We tried the \"Colonel\", a lemon-ginger sorbet with a shot of citris vodka that really made the ginger sharpen up. Be careful if you've already committed to wine though because it can effect the taste. \n\nFinally, les desserts. Oh dear god those desserts. Our neighbors had a molten chocolate cake that for everywhere else seemed so passe, but this was a beautiful cake that completely collapsed in the center, looking like a chocolate donut with the most oozy divine chocolate syrup. We also eyed the Creme Brulee with envy. But we chose the \"Profiteroles\" thinking it would be a light end of the meal. Oh no, it's stuffed with ice cream, liberally drizzled with melted chocolate ganache and topped with slivered almonds. The surprising winner was also the \"Basil Napoleon\". Yes, basil and dessert. Who would've thought? The mini-diced mango, maui pineapple, banana and kiwi topped with three delicate cookie circles went so well with the champagne-citris pastry cream and basil. \n\nGot leftovers? They even wrap it up and shape the tinfoil like a basket. Adorable. Tired, stuffed beyond belief and content after such a wonderful night, we wandered home and slept like babies. \n\n5 stars, and definitely one of my new all-time SF favorites.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-02-09"}, {"excerpts": ["I recommend the trio of salmon, poussin, seared duck, and nuage de noix.

Nothing too special, but the sauce was delicious!\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse\nCanelli beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder/ duck leg confit/ garlic and toulouse sausage\nThis dish tasted the way it looked, very unappetizing. I was very dissappointed in not only the presentation of the dish but the taste as well. The excessive amount of beans reminded me of Mexican food. I barely tasted the lamb or the duck, although the sausages were definitely there. I was expecting more from an upscale restaurant like Chapeau!.\n\nFilet Mignon with Foie Gras\nwith oyster and lobster mushrooms and potatoes\nThe waiter recommended us to get this with the foie gras and so we did. I think it was my first time trying foie gras. The waiter was right, the filet mignon tasted really good with the foie gras. I don't think I could have had the whole dish to myself because the foie gras itself is very rich, thus making the dish very rich.

It's not overwhelming with sweetness. It had natural sweetness from all the fruits. After having such a rich dessert like the french toast, it was perfect. Tasted nice amd healthy. I felt good eating it.\n\nFrench Toast\nBest dessert there!! It's seriously delicious. Who would have ever thought that french toast as a dessert would be so good! I loved how it was warm and there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top drizzled with a little bit of caramel. Heaven in my mouth!!\n\nBanana Panna Cotta\nStrawberry Salad/ Shortbread \nThe strawberries weren't that fresh and a little bit on the sweet side, but the shortbread was delicious.

I've been here twice and each time with different people and the feedback from my guests was consistent - good price for a 3-course pre-fixed dinner for moderate French cuisine, but the add costs on certain items on the menu and side order of foie gras were not worth it. \n\nI thought the French cuisine at Chapeau was not spectacular. Do they use good quality meat, seafood and vegetables? Yes, they do. Do they service with a smile and make the diners feel welcome and comfortable, they sure did. In fact, the executive chef himself was on the floor roaming from table to table checking on his patrons and occasionally chatting up a few conversations and when we were leaving the restaurant, he bid us farewell at the door and saw us off. On my second visit, we left without the knowledge of the chef, he even ran out of the restaurant to say goodbye to us on the street. Service was great! 5 stars for that. \n\nI'm afraid I couldn't say the same about the food. I could only appoint Chapeau 3 stars. No doubt the ingredients were good, but the execution was nothing to brag about. The $38 pre-fixed 3-course menu consists of an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert that you pick from their regular menu. Depending on which entr\u00e9e you pick, there might be additional costs to it. \n\nOn my first visit, I had the duck leg confit casserole with white beans, my guest has the rack of lamb cooked to medium rare. There was nothing impressive or particular outstanding about the 2 entrees that deserve to write home about. My casserole was very heavy and the flavor was a little bland. It was a dish meant for sharing because after a few bite, your taste buds are bored with the same taste and one texture dish - mushy beans and duck meat that was too overcooked that the meat was too soft. My guest's rack of lamb was fine, although slightly better than my dish. The portion was enough to satisfy our hunger. \n\nI gave Chapeau a second chance and returned the second time to try other things on the menu. On my second visit, I had the appetizer of duck breast with fris\u00e9e salad and surprisingly it was much better than the duck casserole entr\u00e9e. They should have just put that on the entr\u00e9e menu. My guest had the Trio of Salmon appetizer and the filet mignon and she thought both dishes were fine. Foie gras was on the menu, but with additional charge. We ordered one to share. The serving was small and a little undercooked for my taste. The foie gras has a little gelatinous texture to it and it wasn't seared well on the outside. \n\nDesserts were the typical tarts, cr\u00e8me brulee, and sorbet. Boring, boring, boring. \n\nIf you ask me will I go to Chapeau again, I can tell you without hesitant that most likely not. I know I seemed harsh on my review, but I had better French food and the city offers many French restaurants that have better French food, why go all the way out in the Richmond just for that?

We shared some laughs with them and it happened to be her birthday as well which made for some added conversation.\n\nWhen we got to Chapeau we were greeted by the Chef and quickly tended to by the other staff.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to read everything I'll give you a quick summary\n\nService: 4.5\nFood: 3\nAmbiance: 2\nOther: Parking: 2\n\n\nI was torn between a few different restaurants initially but ended up going with Chapeau based on reviews. It was our birthday dinner (mine the 10th hers the 12th) so I was looking for something a bit romantic but nothing overboard. The first thing I noticed walking into Chapeau was how loud it was. I don't mind a bit of noise but when I have to lean over the table to have a conversation it becomes a bit tiresome. The tables were too long and narrow putting us even further apart. \n\nWe decided on the \"Menu 1\" choice and ordered/shared the following:\n\nAppetizers:\nFoie Gras\nTrio Salmon\n\nEntrees:\nLavender Chicken\nCassoulet de Toulouse\n\nDessert:\nNuage de Noix\nCremee Brulee\n\nThe Foie Gras was good - my first time having it. It literally melted in my mouth and the apples it was served with were crisp and sweet. A good balance\n\nThe Trio of Salmon was sort of bland. The fried capers had no flavor, the egg mimosa was too strong, and there was almost no salmon on the plate \n\nThe presentation was excellent\n\n\nThe Lavender Chicken with Dijon Honey glaze tasted like a flower bed. All I could taste was the Lavender. The portions were extremely small and had we not gone with the Menu 1 selection (appetizer and desert) it would have been thought of like a bar-snack, not an entree.\n\nCassoulet with the Duck Leg Confit, sausage, and shredded lamb shoulder was actually quite good, but rather simple. The skin on the duck leg was perfectly crisp, the canellini beans excellent, and the portions a bit better than the Lavendar Chicken. The presentation was extremely disappointing though. It was served in a round, brown ceramic baking dish, on a white plate. Everything on the plate was brown which reminded me of a poor experience at Applebees I had four or five years ago.\n\n\nDesert was amazing\n\nThe Nuage de Noix had a wonderfully sweet but strong lemon flavor. It was velvety in texture and the nuts provided a great balance\n\nThe Creme Brulee was hands down the best I've ever had. I'm not a huge dessert person usually but any time I see a Creme Brulee is on the menu I have to order it. It has a delectable crust, easily breakable and amazingly crisp/sweet. The filling was rich and light\n\n\nAn added bonus came when the Chef found out it was our birthdays and had a Caramel Creme Puff sent out. It was airy, cold, and a good way to end the dinner. \n\nWith our Dinner we had ordered a bottle of Malbec, and with dessert a glass of Muscat. Our bill came to $154 before tip.\n\n\nOne of the biggest disappoints for me was the fact that the menu posted online is only about 80% accurate. Many of the entrees and appetizers are different. I expect that at a fine dining restaurant not all menu items may always be available depending on local ingredients, etc., but that wasn't the case for us. It was clear that the website had been neglected. \n\n\nConsidering I spent nearly $200 at the end of the night for average \"fancy\" food, in a loud environment..

I don't know what they put in the seasonings, but the skate was delicious, moist, and cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nWow, the desserts were delicious!  We had the Trio of Sorbet (a refreshing cranberry, lime, and passion fruit), Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and Basil Napoleon, Warm Chocolate Cake.  The Basil Napoleon was a real surprise.  It looked rather plain, but once you started digging in there were lots of different flavors that surprisingly went very well together.  I absolutely recommend it.  The Warm Chocolate Cake had a side of Rum-Raisin Ice Cream that was also yummy.  I think I liked it more than the cake! LOL  With the Trio of Sorbet, the cranberry kind of tasted like grape or raspberry, the lime kind of tasted like grapefruit, and the passion fruit tasted a bit like mango.  We were only able to guess the flavor of the passion fruit correctly, but they all tasted wonderful!\n\nThe service and the atmosphere were excellent.

Basil Napoleon was an interesting combination, but the flavors didn't quite work together.  Floating Island was a piece of art with a delicate weave of hardened sugar curving over the plate.

Upon entering the dining room it was very crowded with tables within arms distance of eachother as expected.  Phillipe came charging up to us and greeted us right away looking for a table.  We were seated next to the door and I was literally in front of it.  A dark curtain is placed in front of the door to prevent people from looking at you while eating.  But people would inadvertanly pull the curtain aside to come in and tap me on the shoulder.  They probably thought it was a soft couch pillow but that was my fatty back people.  Since there were 4 of us we decided to order the 3 dish create your own set menu.  For $38 it was a very good deal.  We ended up ordering different dishes so we could sample everything.  The onion soup and warm brie were very good.  I would definitely recommend getting the trio of salmon.  It was excellent.  We also ordered a large bowl of mussels for the table with pomme frittes.  In hind sight we were better off ordering 12 raw oysters.  The mussels weren't that great.  For dinner I had the bouillabaisse which had a really good flavor.  The manatee ended up trading her half eaten monk fish for my 3/4 eaten food.  I wasn't going to complain.  hahaha.  The monk fish was served with a creamy risotto which was on teh creamy side but very good.  The monk fish was overcooked, however.  It was on the chewy side.  But I still devoured it.  My sister and her manatee had the prime rib for 2.  It was served with bone morrow which I tried for the first time.  It was interesting to say the least.  But wasn't worth finishing because I don't need extra cholesterol.  The prime rib was pretty good but I think it was reheated.  It also cooled down fairly quickly.  It wasn't the best i've had in the city (No, I don't think House of Prime rib is good).  For dessert the Vanilla bean creme brulee is the winner here.  It is just as good if not better than Ruth Chris's cremem brulee which is the best I've ever eaten.  I am fat and trust me I have eaten my share of creme brulee.  The apple tart and chocolate cake were also very good.  The napoleon was given a twist served open face with the 3 piece of dough on top of the filling and fruit.  On the bottom of the plate was a basil concoction.  It made a very interesting combination that worked very well.  I was impressed.  Overall I ate alot of food because the manatee said I basically ate everyone's appetizer, entree and dessert.  As I am sitting here writing this review my stomach is currently resting on my lap.  Good food for a very reasonable price is Chapeau!.  I almost gave the place 4 stars because as we left I was waiting for Phillipe to come say bye but there was no sight of him.  Then all of a sudden he comes barging through the curtains and out the door to make out with my manatee and sister.  I wish he would have given me a kiss.

In operation since the mid-90's up until its move to the Richmond in the fall of '09, Bay Area residents have been treated to the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" that frequently come out of the mouths of the anticipated sold-out crowds at this establishment as they peer down on their beautifully crafted plates as well as their neighbors'.\n\nIts no surprise to anyone that it requires one to make a reservation well in advance considering the space seats 49 (with an additional 12 at the bar), but Chef Philippe personally welcomes all of his patrons as if he was throwing a family dinner, every night, for a family of 49.  As you walk in, it feels as if you're immediately transported to another world (for those of you that have seen the movie \"Midnight in Paris\") by the charm and finesse of Gardelle and his well-trained staff.\n\nEven with reservations, there have been many times where there was a significant wait after the allocated time slot.  I don't blame them, it must be difficult to get people to leave their chairs here.  However, I never did mind the delay since the spacious bar is always stocked with a flurry of options for scotches, cocktails, and spirits I haven't seen anywhere else.  Its really a nice place to just have a pre-dinner glass of wine.\n\nI have never been a big fan of escargot but was willing to give it another shot with the traditional escargots de borgogne served in butter, parsley, and (yes!) garlic.

It really does excel compared to many steakhouses out there.  As such, it is usually an extra $6 to select this item on their prix-fixed menus but is well worth it.\n\nConclude your experience with the always refreshing trio of sorbet with hazelnut basket and apple compote, or one of my personal favorites, the tahtienne vanilla bean creme brulee, and you'll feel like you just had a meal fit for a king.\n\nJust to elaborate a bit more on the service, I will provide an example from one of my experiences dining here.  One time, my friend had accidentally knocked over a glass of wine on the table and immediately, several of the wait staff came over and started to clear everything off of the table.  They quickly replaced the soiled tablecloth with a brand new one (we saw the top of the table completely bare) and replaced every item in exactly the same position it was before.

Couples admiringly looking at each other and their food. Wonderful. There were large parties celebrating birthdays. I love it. Food and laughter is the way to my heart.\n\nWe open the menu and my dear friend said, \"This evening is yours. Order whatever you like, as much as you like. I want you to enjoy.\" At this point I am already preparing to unbutton my pants under the table so that I can go to town.\n\nI shared with her that I completely trust her in ordering and I want to enjoy this food journey with her guidance. After all, she is the expert. She kindly accepted the responsibility... Here is what we ordered: Are you ready? \n\nAppetizers:\n\nSalade Landaise:\nFris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret,\nFingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette \n\nTraditional Escargots de Bourgogne\nin Butter, Parsley & Garlic \n\nOysters on the Half Shell\n\nMain:\n\nFilet Mignon,\nPommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms,\nSauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine \n\nScallops (I didn't see it on the menu today but I believe it was seared scallops over pesto risotto) \n\nDessert:\n\nI have no idea what it was but the chef brought it out on the house. IT WAS SLAP YO MOMMA GOOD.\n\nI guess I should add that I ate a lot of this by myself. The escargot tasted like yummy fried cheese balls. The salade was light and flavorful. The filet melted in my mouth. The scallops were perfectly cooked.\n\nI am having a foodgasm just thinking about my meal. My friend and I enjoyed the dishes with great spiritual conversation. Yes, it was difficult to converse because it was a bit loud but we made it work nonetheless. And yes, I did have to unbutton my jeans before the meal was over. ;) \n\nThe chef came out and shook all the diners' hands. Talk about service. This is was what sets a restaurant like this apart from others. Well crafted dishes and personal connections. WOW. \n\nThank you Chapeau! and my lovely friend for an evening I will never forget.

"], "author": "Lori D.", "review": "My boyfriend Alex surprised me and taken me to Chapeau! last night for my birthday.  I told my waiter after I ate my meal, that it was best birthday dinner I had ever had.\n\nProps to this place being open on a Monday.  My birthday fell on a Monday this year and many fancy restaurants are just not open on Mondays.  And with all the high reviews on Yelp, he knew that he wanted to take me here.\n\nThere is a lady's face in the window etched on the glass but no visible sign saying the name of the restaurant.  So Alex wasn't sure we were at the right spot until I asked him, \"Is it a French bistro?\".  He said yes, I said I'm pretty sure this is it then, and then we walked inside.\n\nNo one acknowledged us until the chef came out to greet me with a hug.  That was quite a shock but felt really nice.  We arrived 15 minutes late for a reservation at 8:30 because Alex had a harder time finding parking than expected.  That did not matter at all, they had a place for us.\n\nThe decor was simple yet classy.  Dimmed lighting, a white rose in a vase on each table, no need for candles.  There was a handful of people there already enjoying dinner when we arrived.  Majority of the waiters and the owner are actually Frenchmen, I understand enough French from high school to tell that they were truly speaking it to one another and not just some person with a fake accent.  Their accents might make it hard to understand them but they are not offended if you ask for clarification.\n\nWe shared a Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic appetizer.  I ordered the Pan Seared Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, Creamy Truffled Polenta, Salsifies, Pears & Grapes, Green Peppercorn Sauce.  They will ask you how you want the duck done, which threw me off for him asking, so I just said medium.  Alex got the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin.\n\nThe baguette was a nice combination of crispy and soft, accompanied by a warm plate with a slab of butter on it.  More places need to do this, makes the butter so easy to spread.  The escargots were mouthwatering, with plenty of garlic and butter, and very tender.  I always have to get them when I'm dining on French food.  And they were good enough to impress my boyfriend as well (it was his first time eating escargots) that he would be willing to eat them again.  Plus you will have enough sauce after you finish to dip the baguette into.\n\nDinner arrived promptly with an oh so delicate presentation.  The tender pears and grapes on my plate were just arranged so perfectly, yet there was plenty of them to savor.  I have had duck before but never like this, this was exquisite!  The duck was not too fatty or stringy, it was just perfect.  This green peppercorn sauce it was in was one of the most flavorful, indulgent sauces for meat that I have ever had in my life.  I wish I could learn how to recreate it!  Truffled polenta was the right, light and creamy texture with the truffle essence slightly enhancing the grain.  I ate every single bite, not even thinking I could pull of the feat,  because it was THAT delicious!  Alex really like his pork tenderloin, it was stacked so neatly on the mashed potatoes.  I don't eat bacon so I didn't try his meat but he said it was tender and tasty.  He did say to me that I need to try the potatoes: I couldn't place the herbs and spices used there, but it was unique and pleasant.  \n\nAlex asked for the dessert menu.  They told us they were out of the Tarte du Jour which was fine by us.  After much deliberation, I had to go for the cheese plate in lieu of something sugary.  Also, another reason Alex picked this restaurant, he knows I love my cheese!  On the cheese plate was Saint Agur (Monts du Velay, Auvergne, [Cow]), Sainte-Maure (Caprifeuille, Vall\u00e9e de la Loire, [Goat]), Comt\u00e9 (Massif jurassien, [Cow]), Marshall's Farm Orange Blossom Natural Honey, Marshall's Farm Natural Honey, Unfiltered-Raw, Apple & Walnuts.  Alex told them to leave the walnuts off the plate and they had no problem doing that.  The cheese plate arrived and there was a lit candle stuck in the wedge of bleu cheese!  I was astonished, birthday cheese for me!  Alex told them that it was my birthday when making the reservation, they made a note of it!  As I finally decided on a wish, I blew out the candle... it came back to life.  So they pulled the trick candle on me, no worries, just means I got a dozen wishes!  My favorite was the Comte cow cheese, which was a harder cheddar.  There were many complex flavors to this cheese, with a bit of nuttiness.  Alex enjoyed the goat cheese the most, which was very buttery and creamy.  And the bleu cheese was very soft, not too pungent and sharp.  It came with very light and crisp apples thinly sliced and stuck together vertically.  I'm still trying to figure out how they did that.  They also had grapes on the plate (perhaps instead of the walnuts) along with a very delicate honey.  A wonderful way to end the meal.\n\nGo here, eat divine food, feel very welcome :0).", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["\"Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic\", reads the menu, and that's what you get and then some.

Bay Area\"... and that's the major reason my partner and I chose to celebrate my birthday there last night.  I love well prepared French cuisine: nouvelle or old-school, when it''s right, it's heaven.  What I saw on CPBA  convinced me it was worth an excursion. \n\nMore deciding factors in our choice of Chapeau included that escargot and duck breast be on the menu.  Bam!  \"Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic\", reads the menu, and that's what you get and then some.  I missed the novelty of the shells and hardware (I love props), but the baked escargot served in their own pools of clarified butter and an abundance of garlic and parsley was wicked... I had to make an effort not to fill myself up on baguette and the remainder of the tasty butter pools which would prevent me from enjoying the rest of the dishes to come.  The duck breast seemed to be made especially for me:  the medium rare was perfection; the duck breast succulent and tender.\n\nThe early bird special is a great choice if you plan on dining between 5 and 6 pm.  We wanted to get bang for our buck so we made reservations for 5:15 pm.  I'd online-researched a good Pinot Noir and picked up a bottle of Shea Vineyards, Oregon 2008 at K&L on 4th Street (fab place - unique wines and great staff knowledge and assistance).  Chapeau has an impressive wine list on its own, but again we were on bang-for-the-buck mode (isn't just about everyone these days) and with  Chapeau's corkage fee being $18, you can buy a mid- to expensive bottle of wine at retail, pay the corkage and avoid a 3-figure wine cost on your dinner bill.  I shared tastings with Philippe the owner and my waiter and they approved my choice.  \n\nOn that same theme, because the early bird / prix fixe menu is so affordable and it was my birthday afterall,  we ordered an additional starter for each of us: pan seared scallop on a little bed of pesto risotto served with a lobster reduction sauce.  It was charming and sublime.  A complete miniature dinner plate on its own, the scallop was hearty yet tender and flavorful; the risotto just the right side of al dente for my preference, and the lobster reduction a nice punctuation. Oh, and before I forget, I am a fussy and impatient diner, so I was disappointed to see the escargot and Philip's chestnut soup (excellent btw!) appear before the additional scallop appetizer we especially ordered.  We were told by our support waiter that the scallop would be served after the escargot which, I realized made much more sense for the sequence.  It was my bad wannabe gourmand party foul... and I appreciate the waiter's attention to detail. Not quite ready to jump into the Pinot Noir  I asked for a suggestion of white to go with the scallops.  The waiter seved me a perfectly paired Sancerre.\n\nAnd before I go on, there was a delightful amuse bouche of filet of anchovy in a bed of baked fio dough that we were served on the house before our meal began. \n\nAs I said, the duck breast was exactly the way I love it.  Philip's pork tenderloin was delectable.  And, as it was still my birthday dinner we again went bang-for-the-buck and each ordered an after dinner mesclun salad with a creme dijonnaise dressing, red seedless grapes, pistachio, fried camembert and toasted walnut bread.  A great way to change it up after your main course and before dessert.\n\nAs I dreaded, I was subjected to the happy birthday singing by the staff when my profiteroles came for dessert.  I'd expected something sinister when I saw Philip chatting with one of the waters at the door.  But the restaurant patrons joined in and sang sincerely and I was humbled and felt like I was really being feted.  \n\nI'm looking forward to my return to Chapeau!  The prix fixe menus starting at $38 for a three-course meal and $46 for four courses of your choice is sill a great bang-for-your-buck for outstanding French cuisine and service. \n\nBravo, Chapeau!

They only had about a handful of twenty some small tables, I think, so big groups would probably need to be reserved way ahead by phone. I already had to reserve ours way ahead for an early weekend evening as I found out why when we came. All tables filled once we arrived at 5pm when it opened. They don't open for breakfast or lunch on the weekends. The place is actually not big and they do fill in the bar as well. Decor was nice and simple inside.\n\nThey do put on the menu to put your phone away which I tried to take my pictures quick with no flash. It was kinda dark inside so thank goodness for my iPhone focus made it brighter. \n\nAs for the service, our table was always cleaned by the bus boys when we were done and the waiter always asked how we were doing and was attending. Our waiter was helpful and friendly, too! \n\nWe ordered their 3-course meal for $55 to make things simple.

It did come with Toulouse sausage which was good as well. It did not come with shredded lamb shoulder as on the menu but gave me a larger cut sausage that might be pork? It was still good thou. I would have preferred the lamb.)\nDessert - Chocolate Cake (oozing hot dark chocolate with a piece of plantain banana in the middle, the sauce spread tasted like coffee and vanilla ice cream with raisers in it. Very well made and very good.)\n\nEverything was good and well prepared. Quality and service was nothing less than expected. I will have to try it here again once my wallet can afford it again.

And finally got to eat here last Saturday, thanks to a lovely surprise dinner from the boy.\n\nWe both ended up ordering the prix fixe menu with appetizer, entree, tasting fish, and dessert. In retrospect, this was WAY more food than I ever wanted, but I'm glad we picked it if only for the delicious tasting fish. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the trio of salmon and salade landaise. The salmon was fresh, but I enjoyed the duck salad quite a bit more. The different versions of duck (smoked duck breast, duck confit, and duck liver pate) in the salad were all wonderfully flavored, and the frisee provided a good complement and palate cleanser for all the different tastes. The potato chips on top were a nice touch, too. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" ended up being a delectable scallop surrounded by a creamy pesto risotto. Probably the best part of the meal, to be honest -- highly recommend!  \n\nOur entrees were the skate wing and the cassoulet de toulouse. The skate wing was fresh and tender, but the flavors weren't as complex as I would've liked. The lamb shoulder in the cassoulet was to die for! Juicy with a great texture and hearty mix of flavors... I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it. \n\nBy the time we ordered our desserts, I felt like my stomach was going to explode. As a result, I only ate a few bites of my French toast with salted caramel ice cream, but the few bites I had were amaaaaaazing. The French toast was warm, fresh, and fluffy. The ice cream itself was dense and creamy (and maybe a little too sweet). We also ordered the trio of sorbet (lemon, blackberry, and mango). The sorbets tasted light and natural -- we liked the blackberry flavor the most. \n\nOur waiter was attentive, helpful, and very French. He helped us pick a Santenay pinot noir as a companion to our meal. The wine was flowery and not too heavy, with a flavor that easily permeated throughout the meal. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe about this restaurant is that they sat us VERY close to the next table. There was probably an inch of space between us. Our neighbors were also very loud (thanks to the level of noise in the room, you have to speak up to be heard across the table), which definitely detracted from my experience. Though the lighting is dark and the decor is romantically European, Chapeau! may not be the best location for a quiet, intimate dinner. \n\nI am a sucker for cute little perks like the glittery hat they place your bill in (chapeau means hat in French), and getting to meet the chef at the end of the meal. We left the restaurant somewhat abruptly, and the chef even chased us outside to make sure he got a chance to meet us.

If a restaurant hits all the marks, it gets only gets four stars. In order to get that final star, there must be a dish, a bite--something--that makes time pause for a moment as little fireworks explode from my taste buds. Chapeau indeed had that moment (more on that later) but a few flaws keep it from a perfect score.\n\nMy girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Being my birthday, I went with the works: Menu 2 with the palate cleanser and the upgrade for the filet mignon and bone marrow.\n\nThe appetizers were a good start. I got the veal sweetbreads while she got the trio of salmon. The trio of salmon was a very well constructed dish, something that wouldn't be out of place at a place like Commis. It was light, fresh, vibrant, with lot of good flavor. The sweetbreads were on the other spectrum, but just as good. It's a much heartier dish, borderline an entree, and I was afraid I'd be too full for the rest of the meal afterward.\n\nThe tasting fish was amazing. It was a generously sized scallop on a small bed of risotto. The scallop was perfectly cooked and risotto was seasoned well with amazing flavor. If they tripled this plate and called it an entree, I would be very happy. She didn't get a tasting fish, but Chapeau was gracious enough to give her a set of cutlery and a small plate to join in the fun.\n\nThe main entree is where I felt Chapeau missed the mark. My filet was well cooked, but overly salty, as were the potatoes. You would think they'd taste a dish before sending it out. I much preferred her duck breast but the duck leg confit was touch dry. I know what you're thinking. Duck?? Leg?? Confit?? Dry? But it was.\n\nFor desserts, I went with the baked Alaska while she got the French toast based on a recommendation from a friend. The baked Alaska was unremarkable as a dessert, having any complexity in flavor totally masked by the overwhelming chocolate sauce, which resembled Hershey's syrup more than anything else. The French toast, however, was mind-blowingly delicious. It's so good I still think about it today and wonder if I could call in for take out for just this dish. \n\nOverall, I got the mind-blowing moment I was looking for, but a few flaws keep Chapeau from the perfect score.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["PALATE CLEANSER:\n\n"], "author": "Robert C.", "review": "Our dinner at Chapeau!

The place was warm, festive (read: loud!)  and relaxed.  The tables were so closely placed together but I did not feel closed in. It was still possible to whisper \"sweet nothings\"  without being listened in by diners next to you.  I guess because the place was equally loud!

Only complaint was that I prefer it a bit thicker, but it was still so wonderful.  The apple of course pairs well (come on, anything sweet will pair with foie gras) and the microgreens are the trend now.\n\nTasting fish was scallop over pesto risotto with some sort of a fish sauce.  Not the Vietnamese fish sauce but some sort that he made himself.  totally different so dont be confused.  It was ridiculous!  Scallop was a perfect sear.  Not over cooked or anything.  Pesto risotto was surprising and like everything else, technically perfect.  Flavor was amazing as well.  So creamy, I loved it.  That sauce put everything together.\n\nduck confit with duck breast.  very traditional.  Duck breast was perfect.  classic orange pairing with it.  I felt the duck confit was a bit dry.  Somehow...  isn't it supposed to be baked in its oil?  Maybe it was because we had the last batch of the day...? I dunno.  It was still good.\n\nSkate wing.  first time I've had it, definitely won't be my last the way Chef Phillipe Gardelle cooked it.  So amazingly good.  So.  Good.\n\nPalate cleanser.  A must!  Vodka infused with lemon ginger.  The sorbet with it... dude.\n\nDessert... again, dude.  I was so freaking stuffed by the end.  there were 5 of us, we ordered 5 different ones, but since we were the last group of the day, they threw in a 6th dessert for us to try them all.  No complaints about any of them.  None.  We had the basil napoleon, french toast, chocolate cake, nodue de naiz (I totally have no idea how to spell it, it was some frozen creme type of thing), and a puff pastry dessert.

The dough was yummy \n\nPalate Cleanser: Colonel - Lemon-Ginger Sorbet, Citrus Infused Vodka. This was surprisingly very delicious. Love ginger though. \n\nMy entree: Wild Caught Skate Wing - per all the Yelp reviews I decided to order the Chef's masterpiece. It was good, but not crazy delicious. I wouldn't order it again. Kind of plain. I guess I was expecting more. \n\nFiance's entree: Duck special (I think). I was so sad when our dishes came out as my plate was HUGE and my fish was pretty large, but his dish was soooo tiny and his food looked like baby bites. He says it was decadent, and that he didn't really need that much, but they could have presented it a bit better. \n\nI did like that they didn't rush us out as I think we left around midnight. I didn't like Chef Philipe kissing me goodbye. Creepy!!!!!! And that he was out mingling the entire time we were there and never once was in the kitchen, was kind of surprising. I guess he trusts his cooks, but I wanted to see less of him chatting it up with the guests and hanging out at the bar. \n\nOverall...I won't be back.

Almost everything about my experience here was perfect, with the exception of one glaring oversight on the part of the server at the beginning of the evening. \n\nWe were seated right away with a Sunday night dinner reservation at 8pm. The owner came by to introduce himself and personally welcome us, which was a nice touch. We were brought water and menus. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more... We waited approximately 20 minutes for someone to bring bread, take a drink order, or take some sort of notice of our presence at all. Finally, our server came over, and abruptly asked if we were ready to order. \n\nThere was no explanation of the menu, or the specials for the evening. I was particularly looking forward to trying the foie gras, which is not on the menu. Luckily, I had overheard him explain the foie gras to someone at a neighboring table, and asked about it. Still, no explanation of the menu or specials was forthcoming. He briefly explained the preparation to me (seared). He seemed completely rushed, and even somewhat bothered by being asked a question and having to take my order. Luckily, I had spent the prior 20 minutes studying the menu, so I knew exactly what I wanted to order by the time he finally deigned to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAfter the disastrous first 20 minutes, I was fully prepared for the rest of the evening to continue in the same fashion. Instead, I was delightfully surprised. Not only was the food delicious, the service for the rest of the evening was exceptional. Same server, but huge difference in service.

The prawns were perfectly cooked, and the flavor was nice and light.

It was too much food for me to finish, but I definitely enjoyed making the attempt. The lamb was moist and tender, very flavorful, a perfect medium rare. The potato gratin was very nice, as was the ratatouille. \nWarm Chocolate Cake/Banana Flamb\u00e9e/ Rum & Banana Ice Cream/Caramel Sauce - Rich, chocolately, divine. The warm, gooey chocolate center is my favorite part. \n\nAmuse Bouche (Smoked Trout/Potato Salad) -  a tasty snack\nFish Tasting (Seared Scallop/Tomato Confit/Pesto Risotto/Fish & Lobster Reduction) - The scallop was so sweet and delicious, perfect with the fish and lobster reduction, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.\nPalate Cleanser (Colonel: Lemon-Ginger Sorbet/ Citrus Infused Vodka) - The sorbet is light and refreshing, and the vodka gives an unexpected punch of flavor\n\nWe had a bottle of the wine recommended by our server, a merlot (actually a blend) that complemented the rest of the meal very nicely.\n\nI definitely plan to go back again.

She only usually likes Asian food and judges every restaurant harshly, as my dad is a REAL 5 star chef -  equivalent of Michelin rating (minus the service, pure taste - think Soup Nazi on Seinfield).  I stay away from Chinese or Asian food with my dad because, of course, he can make it better.  My dad (took him there for his birthday) simply nodded when asked how dinner was.

I wished the mussels were in a larger size so that I can taste the meat of the mussels.  I don't know which fish, dorado or bronzini or both, tasted fishy. Maybe the fish skin that released the fishy taste? I usually marinate my fish with a little fresh ginger juice to get rid of any fishiness when I prepare my fish dish.

The toast was so soft, almost a custard texture. Salted caramel ice cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. \n\nProfiteroles:\n3 profiteroles covered in thick chocolate sauce and almond slivers.

Not only does the bread inside hold its texture after the cooking process, the cheese stays in the perfect chemical state and doesn't just melt away or coagulate. Escargot? Classic. Definitely not for someone who shies away from garlic and oil, but the flavors coming off of this plate. C'est bien.\n\nMains - Although we didn't order the steak and bone marrow for two, the chef came out to personally slice it for other tables, and the smell coming off of this thing was ridiculous.

The tenderloin comes with this creamy mashed potato side that you will melt with when you put it in your mouth.\n\nDessert - WOW. Real creme brulee with vanilla bean inside the vanilla bean custard. Not overly burnt caramelized sugar at the top and just a creamy interior. The real show stopper is the french toast.

Between the two of us we had the scallops with risotto, shredded oxtail with sea bass, bouillabaisse, salmon trio, chestnut soup, baked Alaska, French toast and the chef even gave us a complimentary crime brulee. The amuse bouche was an excellent  tomato soup which was perfect since it was so cold outside.

My suggestion would be that they could dial down the portion sizes (and price) for the tasting menu. They were out of the bouillabaisse. \n\nThe ambiance is not good. The restaurant is crowded and plain. In some spots you are basically sharing a table with another couple, not exactly what we had in mind for a romantic evening out.

That was nice.\n\nBottom line though, for the price, experience matters. If you order the tasting menu, you are probably going to be there for a couple hours, at least.

"], "author": "Mark L.", "review": "I came here because of the ratings.  with over 2000 raters getting 4 1/2 stars is impressive.  And it's quite difficult to rate this restaurant because it's not a traditional French restaurant you visit.\n\nTherefore, it's difficult to rate against other elegant French restaurants and according to Yelp, 3 stars is good rating.  This restaurant definitely is not \"as good as it gets\" (4 stars).  If just based on the food, it's definitely a 4 stars better than many 1 Michelin star restaurants I went to but the overall package is not a 4 stars.  Frankly, I can't say \"I'm a fan\" neither because the overall experience (not just the quality of the food) is not what I expect from how they price their dishes.\n\nService:\n\n1.  Overall, server are courteous.  However, they lacked of the \"classy restaurant\" training.  Case in point, we sit next to a divided wall where servers, for their convenient, taking plates and serving foods across the divided half wall... that feels... not classy.\n\n2.  The kind of restaurants Chapeau! categorized with, I never had to get the server attention.  Which means it's not understaffed.  I had to ask for water twice, ask to order a glass of wine, asked for bread twice (sorry, kids were hungry), asked to order and asked for a check.\n\n3.  The bus (both of them) were very friendly, hard working but one expects more from a French restaurant at this caliber.  They are wonderful servers and I loved to dine with such staff.  However, they need more training to serve in a classy French restaurant.  One server use a towel when he pours water to prevent water bounce on to the table or the customer, that's training!  However, the other servers obviously didn't have as much training... such as serving dishes between me and my wife while he could have wait to serve from the opening of the table (there were someone standing by our table, I believe it's a server for another table)\n\nDecor:\n\n1.  Even though Chapeau! priced as a high class restaurant, the decor is more like a casual bistro.  The lighting is good but if you look at the decor... the molding around the ceiling and the walls, the chairs, wooden chairs that has no style nor character... feels like you walked into a rustic cafeteria.  \n\n2.  Extra chairs were stacked outside the restaurant by a lack luster single door entry.  I believe if pay more attention to design detail, it can make this a much stylish French restaurant.\n\n3.  The entry was divided by a curtain cornered at the entry.  Lack sincerity. \n\n4.  Bathrooms... I've been to many small restaurants in the city.  The food is no where near the quality of Chapeau! but they were thoughtful and stylish design even with very small space.  But the decor in the bathroom looks like those at some cheap Chinese restaurants.    Design can be done at low cost, again it's how much thoughts they put in to it.\n\nFood:\n\n1.  Cream of corn soup with crab cake and dash of truffle oil - Impressive.  It's creamy but not  heavy.  The flavorful chunky crab cake was just the proper portion.\n\n2.  Baked onion soup - This is not a traditional onion soup.  Because traditional onion soup is not delicious... they are always too salty.  This onion soup emit enormous sweetness...  The beef stock was subtle, didn't overwhelm the onion flavor. The cheese they use is probably Gruyere,  Its aroma and chewiness made the soup perfect.  Personally, I would like to see more cheese, but that just for cheese lover like myself.\n\n3.  Blue cheese tart - I had to say layers were so crispy and buttery, the blue cheese didn't overwhelm the rest of the tart.  It's quite good even for someone who's not a fan of blue cheese.\n\n4.  Foie Gras - It was good.  The timing was perfect... it melts in your mouth but still can flavor the crispiness on the outside.  The only comment I have is that the quality of the goose liver.  I've had better where the chef removed all the tendon/vessels inside the liver.  The one I had still have a little bit in it.  But then, even in some highly rated restaurant in the city, I've had worse experience with the Foie Gras.  Thus, I've no complaint.\n\n5.  Filet Mignon - This is done perfect.  I've seen steak done perfectly medium rare, most places will over cooked it and some under.  Chapeau! did it perfectly.  The mushroom sauce is a bit on the salty side but the steak was not marinated much so it turned out to be a perfect balance.  If anything (trying to be a perfectionist), I'd like a bit more crispy, which means about 50 degree higher heat to slightly burn the outside of the steak to make the crispiness stand out.\n\n6. Seared duck breast - Perfect done. amazingly tender!\n\n7. Bouillabaisse - was smaller than expected.  Especially if you had it in France.  The flavor is good, but the lemon in soup was a bit strong.  It was not my favorite dish.\n\nAll in all, it feels like a Chinese run restaurant with a 1 Michelin star French chef in the culinary.

The highlight of the meal had to be the filet mignon. From the sauce, potatoes, mushrooms, plus the bone marrow, created a symphony of foodgasmic flavors in every bite.

I usually take my sister and together we wax poetic about our gastronomic adventures...sometimes we even sing about it. \n\nAlas, that is not my mood tonight. I am beyond furious and I am thinking that I may need to find a new restaurant for my French adoration because I have been spurned by Chapeau!\n\nFirst, we got to the doors about 5 minutes early and were told to wait. No big deal. But when 5 p.m. came and went, I began to worry slightly. See, it was cold and blowing in a rain storm off the sea so waiting on the sidewalk left much to be desired. Add to the fact that we traveled from Hayward to the city in Friday traffic, of course we were going to be early because getting reservations to this place is getting harder and harder- but it isn't because of the service, after tonight I can be sure of that.\n\nWhen we were seated, we noticed that the pictures save one had been removed and that the wall had a bare, naked feel. Our server came over, an Ethiopian gentleman, and did not introduce himself, but asked if we wanted wine. Do you remember my fear, dear reader? You can read the first review of Chapeau if you need to refresh- because that fear was going to become a reality tonight. Another thing we noticed was the staff had a tight, fearful yet angry feel- you know the feeling when you are at a dinner party where the hosts are fighting? Yeah, something like that- people going into the back room and returning with angry faces, or fearful looks over their shoulders. I wanted to ask if the restaurant had been taken hostage and were they being forced to attend dinner service under duress. \n\nWe made our orders. And the waiter did something that had never happened before- he tried to up sell us. For those who don't know, that is the practice of trying to get you to buy more than you want. We made our order and waited......\n\nFirst course was awesome, they really know how to serve fois gras. I love the texture and flavor of a masterfully crafted plate. This is when things started to go bad...\n\nThe water never usually gets below half full- not tonight, tonight it was empty and I had to actually ask for a refill...then the table of doctors arrived and our waiter just left us. Actually the tables around us, save the doctors table were abandoned. We had to wait for random servers to take pity on us, and when our main course came, the manager served it- thank God or I don't believe we would have eaten!\n\nThe food in the main course was a disappointment. The Bouillabaisse was bland. I have never had a bland thing out of that kitchen! The fish was prepared wonderfully but the broth was bland and missing something. In fact, all of the people at my table agreed, it was like the saucier was on vacation or something. There was a layer missing- leaving the dish ok, but not up to the Chapeau standard that they, themselves set.\n\nSo we completed the main course and we were still missing our server and I am starting to get angry. Let's face it, the recession has left everyone with less money and things I usually got to do every month or two is every three or four instead. So I relish it when I am able to go out to French food.\n\nI started complaining and how did the waiter respond? By giving us a dessert before our dessert course. We were all getting dessert with the prix fix menu- so I am really confused to what this was supposed to achieve. Then after I start complaining the waiter goes and apologizes to my father. My father wasn't paying the bill- I was.

Then why were you slobbering all over the doctors' table and ignoring everyone else in your section). Well I was beyond furious and asked to speak to a manager. HE ARGUED MORE WITH ME.

Not gonna happen. I told the manager and she said she would make it up to me next time. But to be honest, I don't know if I will go back.\n\nNo one should have to be angry after they eat French food.

Whether trying to impress your date or just looking for a non-Asian food option, this place won't disappoint.  Everyone seems to be steered towards the prix fixe options, which can make a long meal, but it's worth it for some old school French charm.\n\nCauliflower Soup: Anything with cream and truffle oil is a win for me.  This also had a really potent cauliflower taste, not mellowed out like many other overly cooked cream soups.  I appreciated that it was a free taste in the espresso cup, but it wasn't pungent enough to be a true palate opener.\n\nCheese Napoleon: There was a lot going on in this dish!  They could have been more heavy on the goat cheese, but I did enjoy all the various tastes and textures.  The eggplant pearls added a good smoky layer, but I wasn't a fan of its typical soggy texture amongst the firm, flaky and pasty layers.\n\nTrio of Salmon: A salmon lover's dream, but too fishy for me.  I enjoy salmon tartare, lox and salmon roe individually when paired against some starch/crunch and possibly cream.  Paired against each other put me in fish overload.  I ended up deconstructing small bites and pairing with the tiny bubbles of scrambled egg.\n\nFoie gras: Appetizer WIN!  Two huge portions of perfectly seared fatty liver oozing with complex flavor.  The bread base was too dense for my liking, almost like a muffin.  Would have preferred a fluffy brioche.  The pear fruit pairing was forgettable, thank goodness the foie gras was a star by itself!\n\nBouillabaisse: The accoutrements impressed me more than the fish soup, which was great anyway.  I received three separate containers from which I could assemble a toasted crostini with a creamy spread and top with grated cheese.  I then lowered the crostini into the soup to soak up the broth and it was magical!  The broth was rich with spices, tomato and the sea but not too fishy.  The shellfish was sparse with only a few clams and mussels while the three types of fish filet were overloaded.  Two of the fish filets were awesome, but the third was kind of rubbery.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: How can you go wrong with duck confit, sausage and cannellini beans?  Each item was great individually.  Together they were nice, but I didn't sense that the beans really absorbed the animal fat enough and could have been richer.\n\nScallops Taste:  I'm so glad they cooked their one large scallop properly.  The outsides were seared and crispy while the inside was moist and not too firm.  Cooking large scallops properly really is an art and they succeeded.  The pesto risotto was nice for novelty's sake since I've never had the two together and it tasted great balancing creamy and herbal perfectly.  The tomato chunks on top were firm and rich, like a non-dried version of sun dried tomatoes.\n\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: Standard.  I've had better, but also had worse.\n\nFloating Island: This looked like a Lady Gaga stage act.  A huge sugary dome that was like playground monkey bars on top of a large marshmallow looking meringue and floating in a moat of sweet cream.  The meringue was unique since it was a lot denser than the fluffier versions I've had on top of pies.  It was pure white, not touched by  a torch.

There are also plenty of affordable good wines under $40. \n\nThe \"Trio of Salmon\" was absolutely luxurious with salmon tartar wrapped by a ring of salmon gravlax, surrounded by a circle of creme fraiche and salmon roe, again by an outer ring of crispy fried capers and fluffy little bits of soft-boiled egg, and topped with microgreens and a crispy thin latticed chip. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" that came only with the four-course selection was diced stewed tomato and sprouts atop a perfectly cooked scallop resting on basil-green risotto and a ring of creamy lobster sauce. It was like living \"Ratatouille\", where each individual component was a little spark of light in my mouth that exploded into fireworks when mixed together. \n\nThe \"bouillabaisse\" was a clean and rich-flavored broth with two fish fillets in the center and four mussels around it. Served with crisp croutons made of french bread and two little side bowls of smoky rich aioli, shredded cheese. The \"Cassoulet de Toulouse\" used dried and reconstituted cannellini beans which gave a great texture, duck leg confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and a little toulouse sausage. It was really rich and comforting for the cold winter night although a little too salty. \n\nThey offer two palate cleansers in the form of sorbet served in a little triangle bowl with a shot of liquor poured in. We tried the \"Colonel\", a lemon-ginger sorbet with a shot of citris vodka that really made the ginger sharpen up. Be careful if you've already committed to wine though because it can effect the taste. \n\nFinally, les desserts. Oh dear god those desserts. Our neighbors had a molten chocolate cake that for everywhere else seemed so passe, but this was a beautiful cake that completely collapsed in the center, looking like a chocolate donut with the most oozy divine chocolate syrup. We also eyed the Creme Brulee with envy. But we chose the \"Profiteroles\" thinking it would be a light end of the meal. Oh no, it's stuffed with ice cream, liberally drizzled with melted chocolate ganache and topped with slivered almonds. The surprising winner was also the \"Basil Napoleon\". Yes, basil and dessert. Who would've thought? The mini-diced mango, maui pineapple, banana and kiwi topped with three delicate cookie circles went so well with the champagne-citris pastry cream and basil. \n\nGot leftovers? They even wrap it up and shape the tinfoil like a basket. Adorable. Tired, stuffed beyond belief and content after such a wonderful night, we wandered home and slept like babies. \n\n5 stars, and definitely one of my new all-time SF favorites.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-02-09"}, {"excerpts": ["The skatwing and  bouillabaisse was blow your mind delicious and the french toast and.basil napolean desserts were absolutely to die for. \n", "When we entered the owner came to greet us, and before we left, he bid us farewell.\n", "I will definitely come here again, as they have great food, great prices and great people!"], "author": "deanna k.", "review": "My fiance took me here for my birthday, and I had a great dining experience!

I tirelessly yelped and yelped for days (ok, maybe just like 20 minutes) searching for the right spot. I ruled out any place too sceney, hipstery, trendy or with a Danko-esque price list. \n\nChapeau!'s glowing reviews were the deal breaker. I called two weeks in advance and made a rather early reservation for five people.\n\nNow, I heard this place was small, but I wasn't prepared for the sea of heads I saw as I walked through the velvet curtains into the restaurant. They know how to pack the people in, that's for sure. I was a little bummed that our table was right in front of the door, so we caught every draft every time the door was opened, which was every two minutes being that the chef opens the door and welcomes everyone and opens the door to say goodbye to everyone. And if you thought I was bummed, you should have heard my mother.\n\n\"Brrrrrrr. Close the door! my feet are freezing! vrrrrrrr.\"\nYa, mom's pretty much a huge complainer, and isn't shy with the bossiness. hey, she's a Jewish mommy from Oakland, what do you expect?

The broth was really flavor-full and lovely. The clams and mussels were well cooked and flavorful, but the fish was way too fishy. Everyone who tasted it agreed with me. I really don't like fishy fish, which is why I never get salmon unless it's raw. My mother loved her fish (I think it was sea bass), my sister and brother-in-law got the cassoulet and  sirloin.

He probably had to take the whole bottle of Lipitor that night), and said it was good, but he didn't even taste the bacon.\n\n4. I think the desserts were the hit of the evening. We had the vanilla creme brulee, warm chocolate cake, praline cake and the apple tart. The creme brulee and chocolate cake were drool-worthy good. I'm not a sweets person, but at this particular meal I was the one at the end of the meal with my spoon scrapping the edges of the plates. Licking the plates would have been a little embarrassing for the fam, so I restrained myself.\n\nThe servers were on top of the water, wine, bread, etc. But the service was really slow. Fortunately mom compared the meal to ones she had in France, which was a positive thing. She pointed out that since the food was so filling, it was a treat to be able to enjoy a long, leisurely meal where she wasn't stuffing her face.\n\nIt was also on the Chevy's-level loud side.

There was a lot of ear cupping and repeating. \n\nBut the space is darling (the paint job is really cutsie and romantic), the service was delightful, the food was delicious, and the prices didn't force my dad to take a second mortgage out on the house.

The Salade Landaise had half a piece of foie gras on it, too even though it was not included on the list of ingredients!\n\nThe Tasting Fish was the Scallop over Pesto Risotto with a lobster sauce.

It was a long week and I was looking forward to this evening to be happening!  My boyfriend made reservations and they seated us at the corner in the back with comfy cushioning as seating.  The lights were dimly lit for the romantic setting and with the splendid entrees that kept coming out, I was whisked away to drowsiness and eventually to almost sleeping during the dessert end.  It was very pleasant.  Don't get me wrong!\n\nWe opted for the Prix Fixed (includes appetizer, entree and dessert) with the Trou Normand for the cleansing and tasting fish.  To start off with appetizers, we ordered up the Salade Landaise, which was the Frisee salad with delicately sliced, thin duck confit and smoked duck magret.  It was wonderful!  As for the Trio of Salmon with tartare, bits of sprinkled caviar, egg mimosa, fried capers and creme fraiche, it was well made, but I liked the flavor of the duck better!\n\nFor wine, we ordered up their French Red Wine Bordeaux, which complimented well for all the meals ordered.  \n\nTheir grilled scallop with risotto, was delightfully delicious!  I loved it.  Period.  I ordered up their Cassoulet de Toulouse, which was their braised lamb shoulder for the entree, and it was huge!  Nice and tender, that plate can surely fill 2 people.  If you can't finish that lamb entree (I don't blame you), do pack it to go!  They use foil for packaging and they shape the foil into a swan-like shape and it creates a handle for you to hold it!  Pretty creative over boxes!  Their Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with parsnip puree, was decent, but not the best entree, I would say.\n\nWe got lost in translation for the French desserts, so we asked our waiter which ones we should get.  He didn't steer us in the wrong direction at all.  Their Sauteed Fig in Red Wine Soup dessert, was one of a kind!  Something I have never tried before and worthy of getting!  The fig and wine with vanilla ice cream, complimented warmly with each other!  The taste of fig, vanilla blend and wine, was a wonderful mix that I would have not thought of stirring up!  As for their Tarte Du Jour, which the desciption was not on the menu, but just the name itself on the menu, was superb!  It reminded me of a chocolate puff pastry, but up it by times ten!

Chapeau is still a popular place that gets booked up quickly.  I was lucky to be able to get a reservation with three days notice, and an earlier time slot (5PM), the night before.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy but not as small as you would think.  The place was pretty bustling towards the end of dinner and we could see why.  We were the second party to be seated, and I honestly would have preferred another table than the one we got, but I guess that's okay.  Because it was Restaurant Week, Chapeau didn't offer their Early Bird Dinner, which in actuality is a better value than the Restaurant Week menu.  Since foie gras was back I decided on doing the seared foie gras appetizer ($20) and for my entree the duck frisee salad ($16).  He stuck with the Restaurant Week menu and chose: the trio of salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and the Basil Napoleon.  \n\nFirst came out the amuse bouche which was a sort of anchovy breadstick, first bite, it was just a salty breadstick, then came in the fishy anchovy taste.  He was fine with it, for me, I just couldn't do another bite.  The foie gras mas magical!  He said it was the best foie gras he ever had - even compared to Gary Danko's and Au Cheval's foie gras scrambled eggs.  It was nicely seared and fatty.  The apple slices were the perfect sweet accompaniment.  The trio of salmon was so fresh and light.  Loved the tartare and the creme fraiche and herbs complimented this well.  My frisee came with lots of tender duck confit and duck breast pieces.  I wished it would have came with a little more than duck and the frisee; even a little bit of citrus would have tied everything together and added a wonderful missing element to the dish.  The fingerling potato chips bit did and a nice crunch to it.  He loved his tender and juicy bacon wrapped tenderloin and the au ju was perfect on the bed of mashed potatoes.  He was going to go with the typical creme brulee but I asked him to go with the Basil Napoleon, and we both were glad that he did.  Thin little almost paper thin like crepes with bits of pineapple, mango, banana and kiwi with a light pastry creme makes this dessert light and refreshing.  I think it's a perfect dessert for someone who isn't much into sweets.  \n\nI think Chapeau is almost at 5.  If the Restaurant Week Menu had a beef or duck main entree offering I may have considered going by that menu instead.  They were offering other pre fixe menu options too, but once I heard foie gras I decided to get it with a little something else.  The staff is attentive and wonderful here (ladies you'll get a kiss on both cheeks Parisian style from the owner on your way out as well).  The food was wonderful, and we were totally eyeing the steak for two which may have to get next time.

It does get a little busy (and a bit on the loud side) so to secure yourself a table, make a reservation.  If you arrive a bit early for your reservation, there is a full bar.\n\nFOOD:\n*Traditional French Onion Soup - Delicious and savory.  The soup had a perfect balance of bread, onions, and a heavy layer of cheese.  Though the soup doesn't look like a large serving, the ingredients make the dish a bit heavy so share the soup if you can. \n\n*Escargot de Bourgogne (6 pieces) - Yum, a must get!  The snails are marinated and baked with butter, parsley and garlic.  Extremely flavorful but be careful when it comes out, the dish is piping hot.\n\n*Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin - The pork was tender, though one piece was more tender than the other.  However though I saw the bacon, I didn't taste the bacon.  The pear sauce (I think?) had a nice sweet, caramel like taste to it.\n\n*Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee - Delicious and was a perfect end to the meal.  The dessert is big enough for two to share.  The custard has a nice vanilla taste and isn't too sweet and the top layer had a nice sweet crunch.\n\nSERVICE:\nService is great.  Our waiter periodically checked up on us without being overbearing.  What was nice was the chef walking over to each table to say his hellos and check to make sure the food was to our liking.  Upon leaving the restaurant, he ran out to say goodbye and to make sure we enjoyed our meal.  My only small gripe is that there wasn't a host to greet us.

Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations due to the lack in romantic atmosphere, taste in flavor, and just overall experience.

I haven't had escargots since I was 10 so this was a treat.  They were really meaty & super delicious.  I do wish they were still in their shells though.  Then came the fish tasting course which was a Seared scallop that evening.  My scallop was cooked nicely although the risotto was a bit salty.  I had the Striped bass & braised ox tail for entree & that was the most disappointing dish of the evening.  The filets were a bit fishy, there was this 1 tiny bite of ox tail hidden in the dish, & the sauce was strangely sour in a way that my palette is not accustomed to.  The best thing about the dish was the mashed potato which was really rich, creamy, & buttery good.  I ended with a French toast which I adored.  I am not sure what kind of bread was used but its density was able to soak up all the hazelnut sauce goodness.  The salted caramel ice cream was in sanely good.\n\nMy Daddy (can't call him a birthday boy & birthday man sounds weird) also created his 4 course dinner.  He started with the Porcini crusted veal sweetbread.  This was our first time have sweetbreads & we really liked how creamy they were.  He also had the Scallop tasting course that I did and he actually had sand in his scallop.  He had the Cassoulet de Toulouse for the main course which he found to be too salty (he has hypertension so he doesn't eat a lot of salt).  He really liked the Cannellini bean with the shredded lamb shoulder though.  He finished his meal with his favorite dessert, a Tahitienne vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It had a really nice crust on top, it wasn't too sweet, & it was creamy without being too rich.\n\nThe service was good except for the main waiter who gave off a \"I don't really want to be here serving you\" attitude.

The wine by the glass selection was a little small, but they do conveniently offer half glasses if you're not much of a drinker.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu, which was pretty reasonable at $40 for 3 courses and $49 if you want to add the tasting fish (my gf did).  Bread was fresh, hot, and crusty, and we received amuse-bouche of cauliflower soup which was creamy, delicious, and an unexpected surprise.  My onion soup appetizer was excellent.  The onions were sweet and soft and the gruyere wasn't an overwhelming obstacle on top of the cup but rather the perfect amount.  My girlfriend's salad nicoise was also very good, the ahi was a little too peppery, but the quail egg and perfectly cooked potatoes made up for it.  The tasting fish came next, which was a large seared scallop served over basil pesto risotto with lobster sauce.  This was the best thing I ate all night, a perfectly cooked scallop, the flavors complimented each other so well, really an outstanding preparation.  For the main course I had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin served on top of whipped parsnip and baked apple slices with shaved brussel sprouts and an apple and brown sugar sauce.  The sweetness of the apple went well with the salty bacon and almost bitter parsnip.  I love pork tenderloin, and the dish did not disappoint.

Finally for desert I had the nuage de noix, some type of pistachio, almond, and hazelnut whipped piece of deliciousness, and my girlfriend had baked alaska.  Both were great, and the fact that even after so much food we were both able to clean our plates speaks volumes.

I chose the three course prix fixe menu (which is basically choosing an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $41) and the others at my table got the early bird  menu (which is a limited three course prix fixe for $31). Our waiter was very helpful when ordering and he did a great job explaining the menu.\n\nFor the appetizer course, I had the Fourme d'Ambert tart, which came with a pear salad and a balsamic vinaigrette. This was my favorite dish of the night. It had the right amount of cheesiness, and the crunch from the salad and the tartness from the balsamic complemented the dish very well. My brother got the corn soup. It was very creamy and had a ton of corn flavor. Both of the appetizers were exceptional.\n\nI got the filet mignon for my entree. It was ordered medium rare, but it was slightly overcooked. However, it was still very flavorful and I loved the potatoes it came with. I also tried the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. It was tasty and cooked perfectly. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the nuage de noix. It basically was nuts in a frozen meringue.

I told my waiter after I ate my meal, that it was best birthday dinner I had ever had.\n\nProps to this place being open on a Monday.  My birthday fell on a Monday this year and many fancy restaurants are just not open on Mondays.  And with all the high reviews on Yelp, he knew that he wanted to take me here.\n\nThere is a lady's face in the window etched on the glass but no visible sign saying the name of the restaurant.  So Alex wasn't sure we were at the right spot until I asked him, \"Is it a French bistro?\".  He said yes, I said I'm pretty sure this is it then, and then we walked inside.\n\nNo one acknowledged us until the chef came out to greet me with a hug.  That was quite a shock but felt really nice.  We arrived 15 minutes late for a reservation at 8:30 because Alex had a harder time finding parking than expected.  That did not matter at all, they had a place for us.\n\nThe decor was simple yet classy.  Dimmed lighting, a white rose in a vase on each table, no need for candles.  There was a handful of people there already enjoying dinner when we arrived.  Majority of the waiters and the owner are actually Frenchmen, I understand enough French from high school to tell that they were truly speaking it to one another and not just some person with a fake accent.  Their accents might make it hard to understand them but they are not offended if you ask for clarification.\n\nWe shared a Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic appetizer.  I ordered the Pan Seared Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, Creamy Truffled Polenta, Salsifies, Pears & Grapes, Green Peppercorn Sauce.  They will ask you how you want the duck done, which threw me off for him asking, so I just said medium.  Alex got the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin.\n\nThe baguette was a nice combination of crispy and soft, accompanied by a warm plate with a slab of butter on it.  More places need to do this, makes the butter so easy to spread.  The escargots were mouthwatering, with plenty of garlic and butter, and very tender.  I always have to get them when I'm dining on French food.  And they were good enough to impress my boyfriend as well (it was his first time eating escargots) that he would be willing to eat them again.  Plus you will have enough sauce after you finish to dip the baguette into.\n\nDinner arrived promptly with an oh so delicate presentation.  The tender pears and grapes on my plate were just arranged so perfectly, yet there was plenty of them to savor.  I have had duck before but never like this, this was exquisite!  The duck was not too fatty or stringy, it was just perfect.  This green peppercorn sauce it was in was one of the most flavorful, indulgent sauces for meat that I have ever had in my life.  I wish I could learn how to recreate it!  Truffled polenta was the right, light and creamy texture with the truffle essence slightly enhancing the grain.  I ate every single bite, not even thinking I could pull of the feat,  because it was THAT delicious!  Alex really like his pork tenderloin, it was stacked so neatly on the mashed potatoes.  I don't eat bacon so I didn't try his meat but he said it was tender and tasty.  He did say to me that I need to try the potatoes: I couldn't place the herbs and spices used there, but it was unique and pleasant.  \n\nAlex asked for the dessert menu.  They told us they were out of the Tarte du Jour which was fine by us.  After much deliberation, I had to go for the cheese plate in lieu of something sugary.  Also, another reason Alex picked this restaurant, he knows I love my cheese!  On the cheese plate was Saint Agur (Monts du Velay, Auvergne, [Cow]), Sainte-Maure (Caprifeuille, Vall\u00e9e de la Loire, [Goat]), Comt\u00e9 (Massif jurassien, [Cow]), Marshall's Farm Orange Blossom Natural Honey, Marshall's Farm Natural Honey, Unfiltered-Raw, Apple & Walnuts.  Alex told them to leave the walnuts off the plate and they had no problem doing that.  The cheese plate arrived and there was a lit candle stuck in the wedge of bleu cheese!  I was astonished, birthday cheese for me!  Alex told them that it was my birthday when making the reservation, they made a note of it!  As I finally decided on a wish, I blew out the candle... it came back to life.  So they pulled the trick candle on me, no worries, just means I got a dozen wishes!  My favorite was the Comte cow cheese, which was a harder cheddar.  There were many complex flavors to this cheese, with a bit of nuttiness.  Alex enjoyed the goat cheese the most, which was very buttery and creamy.  And the bleu cheese was very soft, not too pungent and sharp.  It came with very light and crisp apples thinly sliced and stuck together vertically.  I'm still trying to figure out how they did that.  They also had grapes on the plate (perhaps instead of the walnuts) along with a very delicate honey.

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and I can most certainly say that it was an unforgettable experience.\n\nEven before we entered the restaurant, the host was so kind and friendly. He made us feel like we were walking into his home for a truly personal experience. After being seated and waiting a bit, our waiter, a quirky French gentleman, provided us with the menus and explained all of the specials for the night. I personally recommend choosing the 3 or 4 course pre-fixe menu just because the value is so much better, and you and your partner can try different things! The quality of service was absolutely superb. Waters constantly refilled, timely checkups to see how we were doing at the table, and even having our napkins folded when we went to use the bathroom added to the whole experience.\n\nAs for the food, there were definitely some highlights and must-gets:\n\nTrio of Salmon: Definitely a must-get! They made this dish so light and flavorful. The crispy capers added a nice crunch and saltiness to the extremely fresh salmon that was served. In addition, there was a hint of sweetness from the caviar and lemon dressing that rounded out the whole dish. \n\nVeal Sweetbreads: If you haven't had sweetbreads, then this is definitely the place to try them! They have a very savory taste, very similar to liver. The texture was slightly chewy but extremely tender, and the dark sauce and mushrooms that accompanied the dish were amazing.\n\nPan-Seared Day Boat Scallop: Probably one of the best scallops I've ever had. Like seriously. Try this dish.\n\nBouillabaisse: The broth was slightly salty for my taste, but all in all a great dish that contained a lot of fresh seafood and also some DELICIOUS gruyere on toast.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: This was okay. If you're a lover of smoked meats then I definitely recommend this to you. The duck was extremely tender and the sausage reminded me of Texas BBQ. The beans were also good as well, but definitely serve to fill you up quickly. \n\nChocolate Cake: I love chocolate molten cake so much, and this one was extremely interesting! There was a slight hint of rum in the cake that was a little too strong for me, but aside from that it was delicious.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: The best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had!

You don't see that kind of old school chivalry anymore.\n\nChapeau! is the quintessential French restaurant of San Francisco. I've heard wonderful things about the place since I was in high school and have no idea what took me so long to eat here. It wasn't until this year that I finally dined here with my boyfriend's family. $55 per person for 3 courses from their prix fixe menu, $65 for 4. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think there was an option to order dishes individually so don't say you weren't warned.\n\nThe complimentary cauliflower soup was a delightful opener to our meal. Simple, but very tasty. I ordered the escargots de bourgogne to start, which was wonderfully garlicky and delectably chewy. My bf's dad, a French cuisine enthusiast, ordered the sweetbreads-- a dish I've always been curious about because I've frequently seen it on tv and but have never really seen it on a menu. It was definitely interesting; to be honest, it tasted a lot like the Filipino delicacy balut lol. Not bad, though I think I'll stick to escargot; that's adventurous enough right? We also ordered some foie gras to share, which at most restaurants is my favorite part of the whole meal. This was no exception.\n\nFor my main course, I got the cassoulet de toulouse. REALLY filling. I can't even decide what my favorite part was-- the duck confit or the braised lamb shoulder. The sausage was good too. It's the perfect dish if you want to try a little of everything. Of course I forced my bf to get the filet mignon w/ bone marrow so I can pick off his plate. The bone marrow made each bite of steak melt in my mouth. Just delicious, buttery perfection.\n\nI ordered the nuage de noix for dessert, which I personally liked a lot more than the raved about basil napoleon. I really liked the contrasting textures of the nuts and meringue plus the hint of orange. The basil napoleon was kind of weird to the palette; you get that fruity bite with kiwi as the top note, then the pastry cream, and finally the lingering flavor of basil. Meh, felt like I was still eating an entree. However, of the desserts at our table, my favorite was the creme brulee. Classic.\n\nThe only downside of our meal was the wine that Mrs. Gardelle suggested, which was too young and acidic to truly enjoy with our meal. But they did give us complimentary dessert wine at the end. Overall, good French restaurant. 4 stars for the food, bonus points because the owner is a sweet man whose stories made for an interesting meal.

I already had to reserve ours way ahead for an early weekend evening as I found out why when we came. All tables filled once we arrived at 5pm when it opened.

In retrospect, this was WAY more food than I ever wanted, but I'm glad we picked it if only for the delicious tasting fish. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the trio of salmon and salade landaise. The salmon was fresh, but I enjoyed the duck salad quite a bit more. The different versions of duck (smoked duck breast, duck confit, and duck liver pate) in the salad were all wonderfully flavored, and the frisee provided a good complement and palate cleanser for all the different tastes.

As a result, I only ate a few bites of my French toast with salted caramel ice cream, but the few bites I had were amaaaaaazing. The French toast was warm, fresh, and fluffy. The ice cream itself was dense and creamy (and maybe a little too sweet). We also ordered the trio of sorbet (lemon, blackberry, and mango). The sorbets tasted light and natural -- we liked the blackberry flavor the most. \n\nOur waiter was attentive, helpful, and very French. He helped us pick a Santenay pinot noir as a companion to our meal. The wine was flowery and not too heavy, with a flavor that easily permeated throughout the meal. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe about this restaurant is that they sat us VERY close to the next table. There was probably an inch of space between us. Our neighbors were also very loud (thanks to the level of noise in the room, you have to speak up to be heard across the table), which definitely detracted from my experience.

I've been wanting to try this restaurant since over a year ago when someone recommended it to me as one of her favorite restaurants in SF. Well, that's a pretty tall order. Tried to make reservations here back in February for Valentine's Day, but they were completely packed! So the sweetie that my bf is, he remembered I wanted to try this place and booked it as a random surprise for me. Lesson learned: make a reservation in advance!!\n\nYou can order a la carte or from their \"Menu options.\" Meaning either a 3 or 4 or 5 course meal. And the nice thing is, both people do NOT have to do the same option, whereas some places will dictate that you need to. So I got a 3 course ~$40 (choose your own appetizer, entry, dessert) and my bf got the 4 course ~$50, which included a tasting fish. Some options you may have to add a few extra dollars for that choice.\n\nFor appetizers, we got the trio of salmon and the corn soup. The salmon trio was yum!! And very pretty. I love fried capers too. Now, the bf picked the corn soup because there the word \"giant prawn\" in the description, but really...there was only one giant prawn and the rest was corn soup. HAHA...howeverrrr....I thought the soup was absolutely delicious! I love creamy corn soups and this was just the right consistency and sweetness. He was upset there was only one prawn haha\n\nThe tasting fish was a sort of scallop dish. TBH, I couldn't understand the thick French accent of our waiter for the life of me. All I heard were the words \"scallop\" and \"mango\"...which is a weird combination. But this scallop looked kind of like it was deconstructed and flattened. Topped with mango cubes, parsnips, some crunchy nut (maybe hazelnuts...) SOUNDS WEIRD I KNOW. You just had to try it. It was pretty damn good.\n\nEntrees, we got the roasted duck breast and Cassoulet de Toulouse--which had canellini beans,  lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, garlic & toulouse sausage. Roasted duck breast was really tender, the veggies and polenta with it were good...I thought it was better than the one we had at Redd in Napa. Food was solid, wasn't super blown away, but you can tell they definitely put a lot of thought into the food and I enjoyed it.\n\nDesserts: baked alaska (yummy rum cake with espresso ice cream and tahitian vanilla creme brulee...both were solid.\n\nHonestly, I might be okay with just ordering off the menu, but it was a great experience and I would be down to try more things here. But mostly, the ambiance was great and service was excellent as you could expect from French dining. The poor waitress must have thought my bf was a fish because he drank so much water, but she just kept on refilling without a word and without fail. We also got a cozy seat for two in the back booth and we were more than half an hour late for our reservation due to stupid new Bay Bridge traffic, but they called us and held the spot.\n\nThe executive chef, Phillipe, came to offer us the dessert menu and I saw him doing wine pairings for most people. He also wouldn't let me leave without a few pecks on the cheek. Literally...he stuck out his arm to block my pathway as he was talking to other guests to say goodbye to me before I left.

Wanted to find two good restaurants for the evenings I had available and Chapeau was very well reviewed here and the menu was the most enticing of the dozen or so options that came to me as recommendations by way of a local. One of my criteria was that the place was close enough to downtown that I would walk back to my hotel in the financial district after an early dinner and Chapeau looked to be about an hour walk, which is just about right. \n\nSummary: great food, great service, good wines, reasonably priced, and I'd definitely return. Traditional French dishes cooked and served by [some] French people.\n\nDetails: First, let me mention that the chef came out of the kitchen periodically and greeted everyone he hadn't already greeted and expressed his appreciation for customers. He's personable and it was a very nice touch and came across as sincere. Second, let me mention that I got a waiter that is French, an older gentleman whose name I believe is Pascal, and he was a significant factor in the entire dining experience and I would definitely ask for him again if I'm able to return to San Francisco and Chapeau is still around. The menu: very traditional French options, this is not fusion or \"inspired\", it is solid French, just the way I like it. Though not on the menu online, I was overjoyed to find fois gras on the menu as a starter and so the only decision to make was the entr\u00e9e. I am partial to duck, particularly confit de canard, and Pascal recommended the Cassoulet de Toulouse. I should have listened to my instincts that were saying \"too much food!\" because every cassoulet I've ever ordered was enough for two persons - but alas, I didn't follow my instincts.

I must mention the wines: a wonderful Sauternes (they have several on the menu!) was paired with my fois gras and a reasonable Bordeaux was paired with my entr\u00e9e. The red was not fabulous but the wine list is good enough that were I to have been dining with a companion I would have gotten a bottle of something at the upper end, which were not too expensive.\n\nLastly, for those so inclined, the walk back to downtown is a good one, taking California Avenue all the way.

To give you an idea, I have been a patron of Chef Philippe's since his first Chapeau! when it was on 14th street, and had dined at this current location when it was called Clementine. Fast forward to now where it has been renamed to Chapeau! after Philippe closed the other location down.\n\nHaving been a longtime patron, I have tried *every* single dish on the menu and off the menu. The food here is always excellent, and barring some minor details (I will get to it later), never fails to please me and my family. Admittedly, my favorite dish of all time was the foie gras, but ever since the CA ban, the Salmon Trio has filled the spot quite nicely.\n\nTasty and fresh, the dish doesn't overwhelm the palate. The salmon's subtle flavor and texture is emphasized and added to by the caviar and fried capers, and the micro herbs with lemon dressing is a nice complement that doesn't overwhelm the dish. I highly recommend this one to first timers.\n\nYou are always given a complementary Cauliflower soup in a small cup that is rich and creamy. I gotta learn how to make this!\n\nFor the main course, you can (almost) never go wrong with the Prime Rib and bone marrow. It is actually intended for two people, but if you are two females sharing, you will have enough food for a third person (female). It comes with steamed spinach and baked potatoes n' Cheese, along with three sauces that you can choose from for your prime rib. The potatoes n' cheese is always baked just right - the inside is soft and gooey without being overwhelming with its cheese, and the potatoes are always cooked through.\n\nThe best dessert to me is the Baked Alaskan - with a hard crunchy exterior and a gooey, soft rum cake on the inside with espresso ice cream, this is one dessert not to be missed!\n\nCons\nThe ones I would avoid: I had the Cassoulet de Toulouse twice now, and it's always been bland. There's nothing special and the beans just overwhelms the dish. It basically felt like I was eating a fancy baked bean dish...which I guess is what it is, so there you go. I have to admit though, I am bias as I don't particularly like beans.\n\nChef Philippe once had a rabbit dish on the menu. I don't ever recommend it. It was incredibly bland and a bit tough to chew.\n\nWhat else...there are so many dishes, to review them all would make this an essay! So I am going to move onto the service.\n\nThe service here has been on a slow decline. We have been getting more and more snotty or rude waiters where they either were inattentive or took a long time to get us a refill of water, or outright was condescending. In the last case, we have experienced this twice from two different waiters. The most recent one was fired, according to Philippe. Guess we weren't the only ones who got the attitude. Today, we had a white, tall, bald waiter who never checked in on us. It was quite a feat to get his attention for refills or extra utensils, and our tables were never cleared off except when the next course arrived and there was no space. The waiter even dropped a pen on me, which hit my thigh tip down before bouncing away. When I brought it to his attention that something dropped and hit me, did he apologized? No. Instead, he assured me it was just his pen and not to worry. Uhhhh...dude, you just dropped a metal pen on me, a customer. When I was a waitress, it is expected you would apologize for HURTING A CUSTOMER. Not to mention, he was rude when we asked him a few questions about the new dishes, as if the questions were stupid and he was so put upon to answer them. That's one star down.\n\nAs for the food, I tried the Boneless Roasted half chicken dodine today and it wasn't too bad, but not something I would get again nor recommend. The sauce was a tad too salty and the chicken meat was flavorless.\n\nChef Philippe and his wife are lovely and I expect to continue patronizing their restaurant, but today...today was just a not a five star experience.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-12-30"}, {"excerpts": ["My husband liked his dish, he got Cassoulet de Toulouse and said it was great.

Besides, it's been a few days and she isn't dying of cystercercosis.  The puree @ on the plate was really sweet & we think it might be banana.  Unfortunately this item is not on the menu online so I can't go back and verify our suspicion.

I haven't had escargots since I was 10 so this was a treat.  They were really meaty & super delicious.  I do wish they were still in their shells though.  Then came the fish tasting course which was a Seared scallop that evening.  My scallop was cooked nicely although the risotto was a bit salty.  I had the Striped bass & braised ox tail for entree & that was the most disappointing dish of the evening.  The filets were a bit fishy, there was this 1 tiny bite of ox tail hidden in the dish, & the sauce was strangely sour in a way that my palette is not accustomed to.  The best thing about the dish was the mashed potato which was really rich, creamy, & buttery good.  I ended with a French toast which I adored.  I am not sure what kind of bread was used but its density was able to soak up all the hazelnut sauce goodness.  The salted caramel ice cream was in sanely good.\n\nMy Daddy (can't call him a birthday boy & birthday man sounds weird) also created his 4 course dinner.  He started with the Porcini crusted veal sweetbread.  This was our first time have sweetbreads & we really liked how creamy they were.

Because it was a Saturday night, parking was absolute hell and we managed to arrive at the restaurant 20 minutes late. Not a problem, and the head chef Philippe personally sat us down after firm handshakes. He is a very jovial guy interested in his patrons. This was the first flag that this restaurant was not to be underestimated.\n\nI started off with a pinot noir, which was very sweet and reasonably priced at $4.50 for a half-glass. The meal I ordered was the 3-course meal for a fixed rate of $38.\n\nFood:\nAppetizer: Salade Landaise:Fris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret,Fingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette. The salad was OK, vinaigrette added a savory flavor. The chips at the side served as a nice complement to the salad, a softer and easier to chew version of the croutons found in a salad, yet still remaining crunchy. The cherry on top for this appetizer though, was the duck at the top. I love Peking duck, and I expected to chew right through this one but it instantly melted in my mouth causing instant palate gratification and sensory overload. This part alone made this appetizer worth it, eat it slowly. *\n\nEntree:\nCassoulet de Toulouse: In simpler English terms, the main course appeared to be breaded lamb swimming in a sea of canellini beans. Like the other meat in this restaurant, everything is so soft and my teeth literally cut through the lamb like butter. The beans were mixed in a sauce and made the meal filling. The garlic and toulouse sausage was OK, I've had juicier and softer sausage.\n\nDessert:\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake: Very hot, crispy chocolate cake that started 'bleeding' liquid chocolate once I cut into it. In the middle I found caramelized banana sorta like a hidden gem, props for the aesthetics of the meal. To the side was the creamiest vanilla ice-cream I have ever eaten, which made a cool compliment to the hot fudge. I also sampled my friend's French Toast which she got at the waiter's suggestion, and I must say that they transformed the french toast like an art.

I was thrilled to finally get a reservation (one week ahead of time) from this highly praised and talked about french restaurant, but was only disappointed to the slow service and decent food. For a three person party and  one week reservation, we were seated in a cramped two person table. And though the food was better than average, it didn't meet the 5 star rating.\n\nI ordered the:\n\nSalade Landaise: 2 stars. The salad and dressing were yummy together but the duck was prepared too salty. \n\nFilet Mignon with bone marrow: 4 stars. The meat was medium rare, tender, and warm except the outer pieces which was cooked past medium and was slightly burnt and crispy.  The sauce, potatoes, and mushrooms complimented well though. The bone marrow was too oily.\n\nBacon wrapped pork tenderloin: 3 stars. Tender and cooked perfectly, but didn't have any distinctive taste to it. It was okay.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: 3 stars. It looked like a gumbo stew with a variety of meat thrown in together. It was definitely filling but it didn't look very appetizing. Neither was the taste. \n\nChocolate cake: 2 stars. Worse cake I ever had. It had a bit of bitterness to it and I didn't like the rum raisin ice cream. Vanilla would have been a better choice.\n\nFrench toast: 4 stars. This was the best dish of the night. Although it is literally just toast, the sauce and ice cream complimented it very well. \n\nCreme Brulee: 3 stars. Did not have much taste. It was meh. \n\nOur server was kind and professional but slow in refilling bread and picking up dishes off our table. We were seated at 7:15 and did not leave until 9:00.

We eat out a lot and my husband will normally write positive reviews and save negatives for our own conversation.  However, I feel that the inconsistencies we experienced at this restaurant needed to be shared because of the type of restaurant and  the prices being charged.\n\nHere is our experience for Mother's Day: (take it with a grain of salt since it is one of the busiest days of the year)\n\nWe walked into Chapeau right in front of another party of 4 (there were 3 in our party) and we all barely fit into their tight curtained off entry. (it was like being piled onto the 38 Geary bus)...  We shuffled into the restaurant to give the other party some room and just stood there in view of the entire restaurant while we waited to be seated.\n\nThe hostess/manager/waitress (she played all 3 during our stay in her tight white jeans and flip flops) showed us to a table that was obviously just an extra stuffed into the others to accommodate the Mother's Day crowd (we watched at least one other party refuse to be seated there until it was finally just removed).  It looked right onto their reservation/billing computer, back room, chipped wall paint,  and several discarded and unused ice buckets.  I indicated that the table wouldn't be suitable (it was mother's day and I wanted mom to feel special) so we were moved to an equally \"stuffed in\" table right in the pathway of the kitchen/bar that we moved back a bit so that I would not be pummeled and bruised with each passing waiter on their way to serve other diners.  At least this table over looked some of the restaurant... or was that a good thing?  Not necessarily...  (the walls were dirty with chipped paint everywhere and absolutely no art work or any kind of decor to be seen) As we were seated (our butts not quite in the chairs) we were immediately asked... \"something to drink\" to which we had to ask for a minute to consult the menu.  After being seated and moving the table, we were promptly told in a very stern voice that we could not move it because the other diners would not have enough room.. We had to compromise by moving the table just a tad so that their wait staff had enough room. (my small purse had been knocked off my chair twice during this process while waiters passed) This earned us an audible groan and eye roll from the hostess/manager/waitress.  I know she was upset  because it then took another half an hour and my husband's request to get someone back to take that original drink order.  During this time, we considered whether or not we should stay, and since it was Mother's Day, stuck it out and we were glad we did... The food was amazing and the service did get better.\n\nWe had the mussels and sweet breads and both were sublime.  My husband had the pork tenderloin that was obviously brined because it was so tender the juices just ran with each cut... just lovely with the slight bitterness of the kale and creamy parsnip puree.  My Mother-in-Law had the Skate, which had a butter/mustard sauce that went perfect with the green/fingerling potato salad.  I had the Cassoulet de Toulouse that was cooked to perfection.  Everything was moist and the beans still had a bit of firmness and no mush... very filling and good for at least one more meal.  For dessert we shared the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake with the rum raisin ice cream..We wanted to lick the plate.\n\nI would say that if you can ignore the less than charming ambience you may expect for $30.00 French entrees, it is worth it for the food.

Whether trying to impress your date or just looking for a non-Asian food option, this place won't disappoint.  Everyone seems to be steered towards the prix fixe options, which can make a long meal, but it's worth it for some old school French charm.\n\nCauliflower Soup: Anything with cream and truffle oil is a win for me.  This also had a really potent cauliflower taste, not mellowed out like many other overly cooked cream soups.  I appreciated that it was a free taste in the espresso cup, but it wasn't pungent enough to be a true palate opener.\n\nCheese Napoleon: There was a lot going on in this dish!  They could have been more heavy on the goat cheese, but I did enjoy all the various tastes and textures.  The eggplant pearls added a good smoky layer, but I wasn't a fan of its typical soggy texture amongst the firm, flaky and pasty layers.\n\nTrio of Salmon: A salmon lover's dream, but too fishy for me.  I enjoy salmon tartare, lox and salmon roe individually when paired against some starch/crunch and possibly cream.  Paired against each other put me in fish overload.  I ended up deconstructing small bites and pairing with the tiny bubbles of scrambled egg.\n\nFoie gras: Appetizer WIN!  Two huge portions of perfectly seared fatty liver oozing with complex flavor.  The bread base was too dense for my liking, almost like a muffin.  Would have preferred a fluffy brioche.  The pear fruit pairing was forgettable, thank goodness the foie gras was a star by itself!\n\nBouillabaisse: The accoutrements impressed me more than the fish soup, which was great anyway.  I received three separate containers from which I could assemble a toasted crostini with a creamy spread and top with grated cheese.  I then lowered the crostini into the soup to soak up the broth and it was magical!  The broth was rich with spices, tomato and the sea but not too fishy.  The shellfish was sparse with only a few clams and mussels while the three types of fish filet were overloaded.  Two of the fish filets were awesome, but the third was kind of rubbery.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: How can you go wrong with duck confit, sausage and cannellini beans?  Each item was great individually.  Together they were nice, but I didn't sense that the beans really absorbed the animal fat enough and could have been richer.\n\nScallops Taste:  I'm so glad they cooked their one large scallop properly.  The outsides were seared and crispy while the inside was moist and not too firm.  Cooking large scallops properly really is an art and they succeeded.  The pesto risotto was nice for novelty's sake since I've never had the two together and it tasted great balancing creamy and herbal perfectly.  The tomato chunks on top were firm and rich, like a non-dried version of sun dried tomatoes.\n\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: Standard.  I've had better, but also had worse.\n\nFloating Island: This looked like a Lady Gaga stage act.  A huge sugary dome that was like playground monkey bars on top of a large marshmallow looking meringue and floating in a moat of sweet cream.  The meringue was unique since it was a lot denser than the fluffier versions I've had on top of pies.  It was pure white, not touched by  a torch.  After the initial presentation shock and first few novel bites, it got a little tedious.

We tried here on a whim with a call Saturday night looking for last-minute open seats (usually an impossible task). He offered to save two seats at the bar and once off the phone we cabbed right over. \n\nThe restaurant was small and signage not clear from the street due to a huge tree at the front sidewalk. But the warm yellow tones, glimpse of white tablecloth, dark orange droplights over the bar, and tons of happy faces clustered around tables and engaged in avid conversation made us sure we had found the right place. \n\nThe owner/chef Philippe Gardelle is amazing. I find it incredible that after 10+ years he still maintains an energy and charisma that continues to permeate this place and make it so enchanting. He makes a point to welcome every guest that arrives at the door, but still manages to have a hand on all the dishes and desserts and even the wine that appear on the menu. He walks through the dining room, ensuring everyone has everything they need, and he is extra sure to bid them goodbye and help them call a taxi if they need it before they leave. As things calm down towards the end of service he even wipes down the outside covers of every single menu and makes sure the pages are secured. \n\nOn top of that, the food is divine and affordable for French fare without the stuffiness. You can make your own 3-course dinner for $38 (a little extra if your entree is seafood), 4-courses for $46, with a sorbet between appetizer & entree at $50.50. Come as an early bird and order between 5-6pm (excludes Fri & Sat) and the 3-course is $28. There are also plenty of affordable good wines under $40. \n\nThe \"Trio of Salmon\" was absolutely luxurious with salmon tartar wrapped by a ring of salmon gravlax, surrounded by a circle of creme fraiche and salmon roe, again by an outer ring of crispy fried capers and fluffy little bits of soft-boiled egg, and topped with microgreens and a crispy thin latticed chip. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" that came only with the four-course selection was diced stewed tomato and sprouts atop a perfectly cooked scallop resting on basil-green risotto and a ring of creamy lobster sauce. It was like living \"Ratatouille\", where each individual component was a little spark of light in my mouth that exploded into fireworks when mixed together. \n\nThe \"bouillabaisse\" was a clean and rich-flavored broth with two fish fillets in the center and four mussels around it. Served with crisp croutons made of french bread and two little side bowls of smoky rich aioli, shredded cheese. The \"Cassoulet de Toulouse\" used dried and reconstituted cannellini beans which gave a great texture, duck leg confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and a little toulouse sausage. It was really rich and comforting for the cold winter night although a little too salty. \n\nThey offer two palate cleansers in the form of sorbet served in a little triangle bowl with a shot of liquor poured in. We tried the \"Colonel\", a lemon-ginger sorbet with a shot of citris vodka that really made the ginger sharpen up. Be careful if you've already committed to wine though because it can effect the taste. \n\nFinally, les desserts. Oh dear god those desserts. Our neighbors had a molten chocolate cake that for everywhere else seemed so passe, but this was a beautiful cake that completely collapsed in the center, looking like a chocolate donut with the most oozy divine chocolate syrup. We also eyed the Creme Brulee with envy. But we chose the \"Profiteroles\" thinking it would be a light end of the meal. Oh no, it's stuffed with ice cream, liberally drizzled with melted chocolate ganache and topped with slivered almonds. The surprising winner was also the \"Basil Napoleon\". Yes, basil and dessert. Who would've thought? The mini-diced mango, maui pineapple, banana and kiwi topped with three delicate cookie circles went so well with the champagne-citris pastry cream and basil. \n\nGot leftovers?

Dang - I'm from VA - why am I complaining? Darn you San Diego for spoiling me with your awesome weather. \n\nWe were greeted by the cheerful just so delightful chef. We were asked if we had a reservation and when we said no, the chef tried for several minutes to look for a table - mentioning to us that he had just given away his last free table - and even after we told him we can sit at the bar. I was surprised at first with all the empty tables but within 15 minutes of sitting down, the restaurant was full and busy. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the early bird prix fixe menu. \n\nThe bread was delicious. Perfect warm, soft, texture, crisppy crust. The butter was delicious. I ate most of the loaf. \n\nEscargot de Bourgogne in Butter-Parsley & Garlic Sauce - I've never had escargot before. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was scared but adventurous. The escargot was mild and prepared extremely well but the delight was the butter parsley & garlic sauce. It was fantastic! I loved the garlic undertones - it gave it a nice kick. I used the bread to try to finish as much of the sauce as possible. \n\nCassoulet de Toulouse - Canellini Beans/ Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder/Duck Leg Confit/ Garlic & Toulouse Sausage - The duck leg confit is the best I've had so far. Moist, not overly salty, delicious with the crust. The Garlic & Toulouse sausage was amazing too. The beans were a soft compliment to everything. I asked for a box to go.

Texturelly perfect, the flavors were perfect and they used real vanilla beans. Perfect!\n\nFrench Toast - It was delicious! Pefectly cooked, rich, but not heavy. I wanted to devour the whole thing but I was stuffed beyond stuffed. \n\nService was thoughtful, amazing, and well, perfect! I dont' think I used the word perfect and delicious so many times in any review. The staff was so attentive. I loved how the chef walked by saying Bon Appetit and asking us how our meal is. \n\nBut the highlight of the evening was when we were leaving, about 15 feet outside the restaurant, our wonderful chef ran outside, in the rain, to say good bye and hoped to see us again.

I was very satisfied with just that alone.\n\nWe had:\n\nFish and potato taster:\nThis was complimentary from the chef. It was a nice little surprise. I thought the fact that it came out in a little spoon was so cute! Fits perfectly into the mouth. I really enjoyed this little teaser. I really like potatoes and fish so it satisfied my taste buds.\n\nTrio of Salmon:\nGravlax, tartar and caviar/egg mimosa, fried capers and creame friache/ microherbs with lemon dressing\nThis appetizer was delicious. The salmon was full of flavor and was a very refreshing appetizer. It was definitely one of our favorites that night. The checkered chip on top reminded me of potato chips.

I dipped our complimentary bread into the sauce and let it soak into the bread. YUM!

I think it was my first time trying foie gras. The waiter was right, the filet mignon tasted really good with the foie gras. I don't think I could have had the whole dish to myself because the foie gras itself is very rich, thus making the dish very rich. When eating the foie gras with the filet mignon, its best to just get a little piece of foie gras to go with the meat, otherwise it's too rich.\n\nBasil Napoleon\nMaui Pineapple, Manilla Mango, Banana, Kiwi & Strawberries/\nChampagne-Citrus Pastry Cream/ Feuille de Bric\nVery refreshing dessert. It's not overwhelming with sweetness. It had natural sweetness from all the fruits. After having such a rich dessert like the french toast, it was perfect. Tasted nice amd healthy. I felt good eating it.\n\nFrench Toast\nBest dessert there!! It's seriously delicious. Who would have ever thought that french toast as a dessert would be so good! I loved how it was warm and there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top drizzled with a little bit of caramel. Heaven in my mouth!!\n\nBanana Panna Cotta\nStrawberry Salad/ Shortbread \nThe strawberries weren't that fresh and a little bit on the sweet side, but the shortbread was delicious.

Very pleased with this dish.\n\ndessert:  oh boy~ Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e, Basil Napoleon with Maui Pineapple, Manilla Mango, Banana, Kiwi and Strawberries/\nChampagne-Citrus Pastry Cream/ Feuille de Brique, AND an apple tart with hazelnut gelato and fig? preserve on the side.  DELICIOUS.  I loved the basil syrup~ which was not only a good sweet note but an awesome shade of green.  the tart was just right and not too sweet.  the gelato and especially the fig were to die for.  the brule~ excellent and lots of vanilla bean. :)  they also have excellent coffee. \n\nservice was FANTASTIC.  i mentioned this before in another one of my reviews but excellent service and presentation make any meal feel wonderful.  Our waiter, Charles was so pleasant (he also had a very sexy accent).  The owner/ owner's wife were also seen milling around the restaurant which I think is really rad.  I appreciate places where the owners actually put forth their face and effort alongside their employees.  She even walked us out to the door and bid us farewell.  that's a sign of a good restaurant where the owners actually care about the food and their customers.\n\ni would give this place a 4.5-5 stars.  i would definitely come back again. *edit*  i thought they were closing down but @elsie was kind enough to share the correct info~ \"Chapeau is not closing ....

In any case, the waiter spilled two glasses of water and the vase of flowers on our table while he was setting up, all in the span of 5-7 minutes. Pretty ridiculous to be able to manage that.\n\nChef Philippe, however, made the night a very pleasant one.  His amicable personality just makes you feel right at home!

Mostly because of the entertaining couple sitting next to us though, not because of the restaurant. We shared some laughs with them and it happened to be her birthday as well which made for some added conversation.\n\nWhen we got to Chapeau we were greeted by the Chef and quickly tended to by the other staff.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to read everything I'll give you a quick summary\n\nService: 4.5\nFood: 3\nAmbiance: 2\nOther: Parking: 2\n\n\nI was torn between a few different restaurants initially but ended up going with Chapeau based on reviews. It was our birthday dinner (mine the 10th hers the 12th) so I was looking for something a bit romantic but nothing overboard. The first thing I noticed walking into Chapeau was how loud it was. I don't mind a bit of noise but when I have to lean over the table to have a conversation it becomes a bit tiresome. The tables were too long and narrow putting us even further apart. \n\nWe decided on the \"Menu 1\" choice and ordered/shared the following:\n\nAppetizers:\nFoie Gras\nTrio Salmon\n\nEntrees:\nLavender Chicken\nCassoulet de Toulouse\n\nDessert:\nNuage de Noix\nCremee Brulee\n\nThe Foie Gras was good - my first time having it. It literally melted in my mouth and the apples it was served with were crisp and sweet. A good balance\n\nThe Trio of Salmon was sort of bland. The fried capers had no flavor, the egg mimosa was too strong, and there was almost no salmon on the plate \n\nThe presentation was excellent\n\n\nThe Lavender Chicken with Dijon Honey glaze tasted like a flower bed. All I could taste was the Lavender. The portions were extremely small and had we not gone with the Menu 1 selection (appetizer and desert) it would have been thought of like a bar-snack, not an entree.\n\nCassoulet with the Duck Leg Confit, sausage, and shredded lamb shoulder was actually quite good, but rather simple. The skin on the duck leg was perfectly crisp, the canellini beans excellent, and the portions a bit better than the Lavendar Chicken. The presentation was extremely disappointing though. It was served in a round, brown ceramic baking dish, on a white plate. Everything on the plate was brown which reminded me of a poor experience at Applebees I had four or five years ago.\n\n\nDesert was amazing\n\nThe Nuage de Noix had a wonderfully sweet but strong lemon flavor. It was velvety in texture and the nuts provided a great balance\n\nThe Creme Brulee was hands down the best I've ever had. I'm not a huge dessert person usually but any time I see a Creme Brulee is on the menu I have to order it. It has a delectable crust, easily breakable and amazingly crisp/sweet. The filling was rich and light\n\n\nAn added bonus came when the Chef found out it was our birthdays and had a Caramel Creme Puff sent out. It was airy, cold, and a good way to end the dinner. \n\nWith our Dinner we had ordered a bottle of Malbec, and with dessert a glass of Muscat. Our bill came to $154 before tip.\n\n\nOne of the biggest disappoints for me was the fact that the menu posted online is only about 80% accurate. Many of the entrees and appetizers are different. I expect that at a fine dining restaurant not all menu items may always be available depending on local ingredients, etc., but that wasn't the case for us. It was clear that the website had been neglected. \n\n\nConsidering I spent nearly $200 at the end of the night for average \"fancy\" food, in a loud environment.. I don't know that I'll be going back. The service was great but there are many other restaurants that I'd like to return to, and some that I'd like to experience still.\n\n\n\nP.S - The attire there wasn't really \"dressy\" or \"casual\".

I don't eat shellfish, so I decided to stay away from seafood in general. I'm like an opposite pescetarian. The waiter asked me why I didn't eat it and I told him, he was very nice and got me a slice of baguette with tomato sauce on it, which was wonderful. On to appetizers, I had the onion soup. It was alright, I guess since I love my mother's onion soup, it's hard to match it. I found it was a bit dull, it had no bang to the initial mouthful. Then my entree was the Cassoulet de Toulouse, it was nice, very filling. The lamb was cooked perfectly. It was still moist and kept it's flavor. But I enjoyed my boyfriend's filet mignon much more, he had it with the Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine, and it was just indescribably good. Then for dessert I had the Banana Panna Cotta/ Strawberry Salad/ Shortbread. I think that the shortbread could of been either smaller or thinner. This reminded me of strawberry shortcake. It was wonderful none the less. I could taste the strawberry more than the banana panna cotta. Just reviewing it now, reminded me it was banana rather than strawberry panna cotta. \n\nAtmosphere: My boyfriend and I came in semiformal. Sadly there was no dress code, yes, I wished there were a loose dress code. It boosts the atmosphere. Since this seems like a very nice place. There were people coming in, in sweats and t shirts. It was very cramped in the restaurant. You would imagine a place would have quiet conversations where everyone seems to be whispering. But not this place, everyone is so close it turns into a loud hum, just below a Chinese restaurant.\n\nService: The waiter was very nice and very personable. He had quite a thick French accent so when he was telling us the specials it was sort of hard to hear. No problems though, he was nice enough to tell us what we miss with out being irked about it. He also offered to take my coat to the coat room and at the end he held it out for me to put it back on. I'm not use to this service so I felt very awkward. He was really good with recommendations. The chef also came out and greeted everyone, shook everyone's hand and initiated conversations. He reminded me of the chef in a queen latifah movie...Last Holiday. At the end of the meal my boyfriend and I stepped out the door and the chef came out just to say goodbye to us.

Next came the Salade Landaise (Fris\u00e9e, Duck confit and smoked duck magret, fingerling potato chips and vinaigrette), which was a hearty salad. \n(3). It's been a while since I've had traditional escargot and this was delicious. \n(4). Palate Cleanser was apple sherbet with French apple liqueur\n(5).  The main course was filet mignon with seared foie and marrow. Just decadent. \n(6).  Dessert was French toast with caramel ice cream.\n\nAt the end of this particular week, I needed this particular meal. The service was good and the ambiance was very energetic.  With tax and tip, this meal was $130. It's about what you would expect to pay for fine dining in SF.

SO's Creme Brulee was light and good, so I had some of that. \n\nOf course we had wine, the wine was paired to our food, I just said surprise us! \n\nOK - This part is kinda gonna sound nasty... since I loved the bread, I loved the butter.. but at one point, the butter had a piece of hair in there, I almost threw up! I told the waiter, and he told us that he will find out who it is and shave his head off LOL..... but to make it up to us, he gave us a glass of rose. \n\nIn the end I told him my mignon was a little on the dry side... he told me he asked the chef to make me another one so i can take it home to eat it and it'll be just right when I heat it up.

It's a heavy dish with a tad too much salt, but can be balanced out with good wine...\n\nI selected a modest 2006 Sup\u00e9rieur Senailhac I found rather luxurious being a bargain French Bordeaux, smooth mouthfeel and a nice fragrant blend with oak and dark fruit tasting notes.\n\nEscargots: a half dozen prepared in the classic Bourguignonne style. Some exertions needed upon mastication, good balance of salty and earthy.\n\nFourme D'Armbert Tart - Frisee Salad, Anjou Pear, Balsamic Reduction: a mountainous pile of Frisee gives a fresh crispness that compliments a heavier pan-fried savory tart batter, offset by the sweetness of the fruit. This was a very simple dish that demonstrated effective contrast.\n\nTrou Normand - Green Apple Sorbet, Calvados: I don't recall ever being served a dessert amuse bouche in between warm savory courses in any French dining, but I find the freezing tartness of the sorbet an effective disruption, giving tonight's dinner a multidimensional experience.\n\nWild Skate Wing in Brown Butter - Fingering Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache: A popular Southeastern French dish is this tricky fish which could taste rather off if improperly prepared.

Umami nuances tastefully furnished by both varieties of the fungi.\n\nProfiteroles: sweet creamy filling in a puffy choux, topped with chocolate syrup and dusted in powdered sugar.

Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think there was an option to order dishes individually so don't say you weren't warned.\n\nThe complimentary cauliflower soup was a delightful opener to our meal. Simple, but very tasty. I ordered the escargots de bourgogne to start, which was wonderfully garlicky and delectably chewy. My bf's dad, a French cuisine enthusiast, ordered the sweetbreads-- a dish I've always been curious about because I've frequently seen it on tv and but have never really seen it on a menu.

The toast was so soft, almost a custard texture. Salted caramel ice cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. \n\nProfiteroles:\n3 profiteroles covered in thick chocolate sauce and almond slivers. These were okay, but the puff pastry was a little stale, possibly left in the fridge for a while. The chocolate sauce was cold. I've definitely had better profiteroles. \n\nThe prices aren't bad for French fare, but certainly getting up there. The food was pretty good.

I was debating between that and the lamb shoulder, but my gut just went with good old beef. It was cooked perfectly; true medium rare. Just enough red juice was oozing, and the meat was tender. It came with diced potatoes and mushrooms, but those got pretty salty once it soaked in the sauce for too long. The filet mignon with the sauce was mouth-watering, on the other hand. It was seriously one of the most tender cuts I've had, and incredibly well made.\n\nFor dessert, we all got something different. I got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but had a taste of the French toast, chocolate cake, baked Alaska, and trio sorbet. French toast was a little too sweet for me, chocolate cake cake was good but super rich (so I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it), trio sorbet tasted like the real fruit (mango, lemon, and black currant, but black currant tasted a bit spiked), and the baked Alaska definitely had a strong rum taste (my tolerance is pretty low since I rarely drink, so others may think otherwise). My creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was not too sweet, and the portion was a huge size. The layer of sugar wasn't perfect since it didn't cut my mouth as I bit into a bite,  and the consistency of the cream part wasn't too thick.\n\nWe walked out of there STUFFED, but our stomachs were definitely happy. It's a cute little restaurant, and definitely a great place to have a nice dinner without breaking the bank. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

"], "author": "Mark L.", "review": "I came here because of the ratings.  with over 2000 raters getting 4 1/2 stars is impressive.  And it's quite difficult to rate this restaurant because it's not a traditional French restaurant you visit.\n\nTherefore, it's difficult to rate against other elegant French restaurants and according to Yelp, 3 stars is good rating.  This restaurant definitely is not \"as good as it gets\" (4 stars).  If just based on the food, it's definitely a 4 stars better than many 1 Michelin star restaurants I went to but the overall package is not a 4 stars.  Frankly, I can't say \"I'm a fan\" neither because the overall experience (not just the quality of the food) is not what I expect from how they price their dishes.\n\nService:\n\n1.  Overall, server are courteous.  However, they lacked of the \"classy restaurant\" training.  Case in point, we sit next to a divided wall where servers, for their convenient, taking plates and serving foods across the divided half wall... that feels... not classy.\n\n2.  The kind of restaurants Chapeau! categorized with, I never had to get the server attention.  Which means it's not understaffed.  I had to ask for water twice, ask to order a glass of wine, asked for bread twice (sorry, kids were hungry), asked to order and asked for a check.\n\n3.  The bus (both of them) were very friendly, hard working but one expects more from a French restaurant at this caliber.  They are wonderful servers and I loved to dine with such staff.  However, they need more training to serve in a classy French restaurant.  One server use a towel when he pours water to prevent water bounce on to the table or the customer, that's training!  However, the other servers obviously didn't have as much training... such as serving dishes between me and my wife while he could have wait to serve from the opening of the table (there were someone standing by our table, I believe it's a server for another table)\n\nDecor:\n\n1.  Even though Chapeau! priced as a high class restaurant, the decor is more like a casual bistro.  The lighting is good but if you look at the decor... the molding around the ceiling and the walls, the chairs, wooden chairs that has no style nor character... feels like you walked into a rustic cafeteria.  \n\n2.  Extra chairs were stacked outside the restaurant by a lack luster single door entry.  I believe if pay more attention to design detail, it can make this a much stylish French restaurant.\n\n3.  The entry was divided by a curtain cornered at the entry.  Lack sincerity. \n\n4.  Bathrooms... I've been to many small restaurants in the city.  The food is no where near the quality of Chapeau! but they were thoughtful and stylish design even with very small space.  But the decor in the bathroom looks like those at some cheap Chinese restaurants.    Design can be done at low cost, again it's how much thoughts they put in to it.\n\nFood:\n\n1.  Cream of corn soup with crab cake and dash of truffle oil - Impressive.  It's creamy but not  heavy.  The flavorful chunky crab cake was just the proper portion.\n\n2.  Baked onion soup - This is not a traditional onion soup.  Because traditional onion soup is not delicious... they are always too salty.  This onion soup emit enormous sweetness...  The beef stock was subtle, didn't overwhelm the onion flavor. The cheese they use is probably Gruyere,  Its aroma and chewiness made the soup perfect.  Personally, I would like to see more cheese, but that just for cheese lover like myself.\n\n3.  Blue cheese tart - I had to say layers were so crispy and buttery, the blue cheese didn't overwhelm the rest of the tart.  It's quite good even for someone who's not a fan of blue cheese.\n\n4.  Foie Gras - It was good.  The timing was perfect... it melts in your mouth but still can flavor the crispiness on the outside.  The only comment I have is that the quality of the goose liver.  I've had better where the chef removed all the tendon/vessels inside the liver.  The one I had still have a little bit in it.  But then, even in some highly rated restaurant in the city, I've had worse experience with the Foie Gras.  Thus, I've no complaint.\n\n5.  Filet Mignon - This is done perfect.  I've seen steak done perfectly medium rare, most places will over cooked it and some under.  Chapeau! did it perfectly.  The mushroom sauce is a bit on the salty side but the steak was not marinated much so it turned out to be a perfect balance.  If anything (trying to be a perfectionist), I'd like a bit more crispy, which means about 50 degree higher heat to slightly burn the outside of the steak to make the crispiness stand out.\n\n6. Seared duck breast - Perfect done. amazingly tender!\n\n7. Bouillabaisse - was smaller than expected.  Especially if you had it in France.  The flavor is good, but the lemon in soup was a bit strong.  It was not my favorite dish.\n\nAll in all, it feels like a Chinese run restaurant with a 1 Michelin star French chef in the culinary.

If a restaurant hits all the marks, it gets only gets four stars. In order to get that final star, there must be a dish, a bite--something--that makes time pause for a moment as little fireworks explode from my taste buds. Chapeau indeed had that moment (more on that later) but a few flaws keep it from a perfect score.\n\nMy girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Being my birthday, I went with the works: Menu 2 with the palate cleanser and the upgrade for the filet mignon and bone marrow.\n\nThe appetizers were a good start. I got the veal sweetbreads while she got the trio of salmon. The trio of salmon was a very well constructed dish, something that wouldn't be out of place at a place like Commis. It was light, fresh, vibrant, with lot of good flavor. The sweetbreads were on the other spectrum, but just as good. It's a much heartier dish, borderline an entree, and I was afraid I'd be too full for the rest of the meal afterward.\n\nThe tasting fish was amazing. It was a generously sized scallop on a small bed of risotto. The scallop was perfectly cooked and risotto was seasoned well with amazing flavor. If they tripled this plate and called it an entree, I would be very happy. She didn't get a tasting fish, but Chapeau was gracious enough to give her a set of cutlery and a small plate to join in the fun.\n\nThe main entree is where I felt Chapeau missed the mark. My filet was well cooked, but overly salty, as were the potatoes. You would think they'd taste a dish before sending it out. I much preferred her duck breast but the duck leg confit was touch dry. I know what you're thinking. Duck?? Leg?? Confit?? Dry? But it was.\n\nFor desserts, I went with the baked Alaska while she got the French toast based on a recommendation from a friend. The baked Alaska was unremarkable as a dessert, having any complexity in flavor totally masked by the overwhelming chocolate sauce, which resembled Hershey's syrup more than anything else. The French toast, however, was mind-blowingly delicious. It's so good I still think about it today and wonder if I could call in for take out for just this dish. \n\nOverall, I got the mind-blowing moment I was looking for, but a few flaws keep Chapeau from the perfect score.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the filet mignon add bone marrow which came out to about $40.

When I was still settling in, i heard someone say \" Hello Mademoiselle\"  , shock to hear this, i turned around, and there he was Philippe the head chef.  \" Hello, mademoiselle, how are you? thank you for coming here tonight\" * shakes hands and leaves* i was completely star struck to say the least.  I  never had the head chef come out and talk to people. I felt rich and felt like an important socialite, yes i know i'm dreaming. \n\nAnyways, my friend and i did the prix menu for $38.00.  The special for that night was the foie gras which was an additional 6.00 with is totally worth it! It was seared perfectly! It literally melts in your mouth. I wanted to savor every bite of it and eat it as slowly as possible. If only i can have this as my entree I absolutely love it. They had a special sauce with this dish. I asked my waitress what type of sauce it was, she said it was an apple gastrique sauce. It went perfectly with the foie gras, pear and the bread. I now know what i want to eat if i was stuck on an island and i can only chose one item to eat for the rest of my life. The foie gras totally exceeded my expectations. \n\nWe also were give samples of the shredded rabbit on a baguette. I like how the rabbit was shredded, I've had rabbit before in other places but it was tough. But this wasn't the case here. It was tender and it had a good amount of juice in it.  \n\nFor the main course i had the Filet Mignon with the bone marrow.  The Filet Mignon was good it was tender, I loved the potatoes that it came with. The potatoes were so good and the sauce with the steak was every more tasty. It was my first time eating bone marrow. i was able to scrap all to the bottom and use the spoon to spoon it out. The tasted like foie gras! It was super yummy but too bad it was as small portion.   My friend got the Wild Caught Skate Wing. It wasn't dry and it had a good amount of sauce on it.  It tasted very smooth and silky\n\nFor dessert, we got the baked Alaska and the French toast.  The french toast was very soft and it was covered in caramel. It wasn't too bad, and it went perfectly with the coffee ice cream. I hope to find a way to make it exactly like theirs at home. My friend got the Baked Alaska, It had the Italian Meringue, with rum sponge cake inside and the ice cream inside as well.. I like the outside of it more, because of the texture. The inside had a very strong rum taste to it. So it's perfect for you rum lovers\n\nOverall, i enjoyed my experience here, and I can't wait to come back, but i now know to make reservations far in advance.

Yes, right when we entered, we were greeted by the welcoming hostess and the chef which was awesome!

I've never had legit French fine dining so Yelp was a very good friend to me. With an average of 4.5 stars and a total of 1736 reviews, Chapeau! definitely did not disappoint. D thought it was delicious and it was also a delicious cherry pop of the French cuisine for me. \n\nI made reservations for 8pm, but we got there around 730pm since we left early enough to leave plenty of time for parking. Right when we walked in, we were a bit confused as to what to do. When you walk in, it's like a super small \"lobby\" with curtains blocking your view of the dining area so if there is nobody standing in that little lobby waiting on customers, you might be ignored for a long time because no one can see you. So after a minute of being confused, I decided to just walk out of that area so the hostess would be able to see me. If anything, this would be my only complaint for Chapeau. I was scared that this little neglect would set the tone for the night, but thank God it didn't. After the hostess saw us, we were seated right away. \n\nChapeau is small, and with the dim lights, it's very intimate and romantic. The tables are pretty squished together and though the restaurant wasn't that crowded that night, D and I were seated right next to another couple. We were seated so close that it felt like we were just all seated together on one table. It was a bit awkward at first.....but the older couple was very friendly and super cute so it turned out to be a-okay. (I hope to be that cute with my significant other in the future hehe) \n\nAnyway, let's start on the food. D and I both ordered the 3 course meal which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. \n\nAppetizers:\n- I chose the oysters. It came with six oysters, special vinegar sauce with garlic, and lemon. Oh it was divine. The oysters were plump and just the perfect size and the sauce went soooo well with the oysters. \n- D chose the escargot. He loves escargot so I already knew beforehand that he would choose this. I'm glad it didn't disappoint my little birthday boy. At the end of dinner I asked him what was his favorite, and he choose the escargot. Everything was yummy, but this was how yummy the escargot was for him. \n\nEntree:\n- Filet mignon was mine! Hehe mmm! I love meat. I asked for it medium rare and it was indeed medium rare! It was tender and was served on a bed of potatoes and mushrooms. Everything about this dish was cooked to perfection. Honestly if you asked me to choose between the filet mignon itself or the potatoes and mushrooms, I wouldn't know which to choose..I guess it was just too perfect together. \n- D had the duck leg confit. Oh this was really good too! It came with some veggies...and something else but I don't really remember what it was. The duck was tender and soft. Once you bit into it, it pretty much just melted in your mouth. Oh gosh. Talk about orgasm in your mouth..\n\nDessert:\nWe decided on the creme brulee and french toast. Funny story to this. I was waiting for D to go to the bathroom throughout the whole dinner so I could ask our hostess to put a candle on his dessert. Time was flying by and he still didn't leave the table so this had to go down:\n\n \"Umm do you need to use the bathroom?\"\n\"No...\"\n\"Maybe you should go..\"\n\"What..why? Oh. Are you trying to tell them to put a candle on it..?\" -laughs-\n\"Hehe yes.\"\n\nSo he leaves to use the bathroom and after a minute or two trying to find the hostess, I get a text from D saying 'she's waiting for the bathroom LOL'\n\nOh dammit. Then while I tried to wave down a waiter, another waiter started walking out with our desserts. Fail boat.. I ended up asking if he could put a candle on it first and the older gentleman waiter was very happy to oblige to my request. It took a while for D to come out and even though it wouldn't take long for them to put a candle on it, the waiter actually waited for my boyfriend to return to surprise him with his candled creme brulee. I very very much appreciated this :) \n\nSo back to the desserts. OMG SO GOOD. The french toast takes 15 mins to make after ordering but omg omg omg, you have to get this. THE BEST DESSERT EVER. It comes with salted caramel ice cream and goodness, it was that out-of-this-world type of good. The creme brulee was also very yummy. Unlike usual creme brulee with the hard top, this one wasn't as hard. I liked it more this way. Made it seem more fresh and made-to-order. The inside was very creamy and not too sweet. Yums. \n\nWow.

I came here with a bunch of friends for SF Dine About Town at one of my girlfriend's suggestions since she loves French cuisine. I've always passed by this area on Clement but never noticed Chapeau! It has a cute exterior but is quite small and can be easy to miss.\n\nI had made the reservation for 7:30pm for 6 but last mine my friend's girlfriend decided to come along too. Unfortunately because this restaurant is pretty small and they were packed that night, we could not be moved to a larger table and had to accommodate 7 people at a table that was only sufficient for 6. It wasn't really the restaurants fault and both the hostess and our waiter were extremely attentive and accommodating, apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Dine About Town Menu was $34.95 for a three course pre-fixe meal. After taking a look at their regular menu, we all found it to be unnecessary. Chapeau offers their own pre-fixe menus for similar prices and your options are open to anything on the menu. It costs additional for certain items but well worth the cost.\n\nBetween the 7 of us, we sampled most of the entrees as well as a majority of the desserts. The food was delicious. I don't quiet remember every item we ordered but each entree was as delicious as it looked. I would definitely recommend the Salade Landaise as an appetizer. Pan Seared Foie Gras was the special for the day; this would be a good dish to share since it comes in a large heavy piece. Personally i prefer the rare preparation much more but this was quite tasty as well. It was an amusing highlight that braised lamb came with baby carrots and the filet mignon was quiet tender. For desserts... the Profiteroles is a MUST !! Out of the 5 desserts we shared, this one was the best. Fresh cream puff pastries with chocolate drizzle and ice cream :) :)\n\n\nGet out to Richmond and try this place! & make a reservation so you can get a better table !\n\n- jenn", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-24"}, {"excerpts": ["For dinner we had the boullaibaise and filet mignon with bone marrow.

She pretty much breezed through the menu quick, we felt kinda rushed and confused on what the specials were. Then when we ordered our cocktails I asked for which rose' bottles would be good and if I can try them, she didn't bother to tell me. She just told one of the other waiters to grab a rose bottle and serve it to me. I didn't even know which bottle it was until I asked the waiter if I can see the bottle so I knew which brand or region it came from. Again, we felt a bit rushed in ordering the food.\n2) It's a very small place and for Mother's Day weekend it was pretty packed. All of the tables were full but it was ok, that didn't bother us. What bothered us were the utensils laying out at the end of the bar vs the kitchen. That's where the waiters and busboys would grab clean utensils and set it up on the tables.

For the appetizer we ordered the Foie Gras Torchon with Brioche, Mussels and Fries, Veal Sweetbreads, and Salade Landaise. Note that some appetizers, like the Mussels, can be ordered as an entree or an appetizer, but I would order it as an appetizer so you can try other entrees. Also, the portion size for the Mussel appetizer was plenty big and could easily have been for more than TWO people. The mussels were bite sized and bathed in a delicious wine sauce (and a huge portion!).

"], "author": "Stefan N.", "review": "An extremely disappointing meal; stressful ambience and terrible service. The food is fine, but not worth the price or tolerating the rest of the experience. Here's our story:\n\nWe arrived on time for a late evening reservation on a Saturday night. The restaurant was crowded: every table was taken and the vestibule / greeting area, which feels like it's about 4 feet by 4 feet, was packed shoulder to shoulder with guests waiting to be seated. It took us several minutes, packed like sardines and listening to the owner yelling into a phone, just to get attention (actually, it required the owner snapping at the maitre d' with an embarrassing and abusive-sounding, \"Will you please seat the people?!\" to get attention). We're still in the vestibule, curtained off from the restaurant, and things are already feeling hectic.\n\nThe dining room is PACKED and LOUD. There are far too many tables in too small of an area, and there's an immediate sense that we're about to have a cheap and commoditized experience. It's obvious the management cares more about optimizing tables/revenue than ambience.\n\nWalking across the dining room, we unintentionally create multiple traffic jams of wait staff and there's an overwhelming feeling that we are in the way. The maitre d' asks for our jackets, but there's literally no room to stretch our arms and take them off. We reach across other diners' tables, careful not to dip our jackets in their $50 entrees, and eek out of our jackets. The maitre d' takes them to the coat room -- actually, some hooks on the walkway between the kitchen and the dining room -- and, in the process, creates a backup of staff trying to get in and out of the kitchen. One waiter tries to walk through the blocked kitchen door, crashes into it, and drops silverware everywhere. Oops. Fortunately, we barely hear the crash over the din of other diners.\n\nOur table is uncomfortably close to the diners on either side of us, so close that they bump into and move our table whenever someone leaves to go home or visit the restroom. My girlfriend and I have trouble paying attention to each other over the conversations happening on either side of us. We felt exposed; absolutely no privacy for intimate conversation.\n\nWe both ordered the $75 chef's menu. The staff was pleasant, but forgetful. They forgot:\n- To bring our wine (we ordered wine as soon as we sat down, but didn't get any until after amuse-bouche and halfway through the first course)\n- To bring an entire course (sorbet before the main course)\n- Silverware for our main course (we watched our rare filet mignon cook for two minutes)\n- Wine refills (we were never offered a second pour in over 2 hours)\n- To clear our plates (we spent significantly more time staring at dirty plates than eating)\n- To clean our table (crumbs everywhere until the very end)\n\nWhen the staff did bring things, they were rushed and oafish. Splashed wine. Silverware thrown down and clanged about. Rushed explanations of the dishes plopped in front of us. Basically, the service quality of a Denny's.\n\nWhen we mentioned a course had been forgotten, there was no apology. They later brought us a free creme brulee, but neither of us wanted it or had asked for it. To add insult to injury, the desserts that did come with our meal (figs in wine sauce) were literally inedible. For our dessert course, we sat disappointed with three plates: one we didn't want, and two we couldn't eat. We picked at the few bites of ice cream that weren't smothered in bitter, salty, fig sauce.\n\nThe bathroom (which we got to know well, having to sit and drink water for over 2 hours) was FILTHY. The floors were wet and dangerously slippery, and the room generally felt unclean. They say you can judge the cleanliness of a restaurant by the bathroom; knowing this, when I saw their bathroom, I considered leaving.\n\nFor two hours and over $200, we felt like we got some decent filet mignon, an enjoyable appetizer, a forgettable amuse-bouche, an inedible dessert, and an order of stress and frustration. We couldn't even get drunk because the staff never remembered to refill our wine glasses. We did enjoy the bread and butter, but the waiter forgot when we asked for more.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever felt RIPPED OFF by a dining experience. Going out for burritos would have been more relaxed and better value. It feels like all of our complaints -- the ambience, noise, forgetful staff, botched desserts -- are simply a product of greed: too many diners without enough space or staff to support them. You can tell this place could be (or maybe once was?) special, but greed is holding it back.

The veal melts in your mouth and all the ingredients just complement each other so nicely. The mushroom by themselves are also phenomenal. \n\nFilet Mignon: All that needs to be said, and it did not let down one bit.\n\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake: It was good, but not as satisfying as the other two dishes.

I thought it was just a playful name for the Salted Caramel and Chestnut Puree that it came with. Rich, cold + hot, and truly decadent. The fruity Basil Napoleon was refreshing and a great choice if you're too stuffed.

I really like the mixed nuts within it. But I would probably never order a green salad in this kinda fine dinning restaurant. The only reason we did cuz my friend is vegetarian.\n- Tomato soup(3.5/5): it was a lil bit sour for me.\n- Pork tenderloin (4/5): it wasn't overcooked but it was a little bit dry. I think they cooked it wrong they used the way to cook filet mignon to cook the tenderloin. The Apple-Calvados sauce was really good and the side dish kale and Parsnip pur\u00e9e made up for the meat for sure.\n- Baked Alaska (4.5/5): this is probably my favorite dish of the night, definitely highly recommended. It's a rum flavored cake with candied toasted almonds inside and italian meringue outside. Also they have the espresso ice cream inside. They sprayed the almonds and chocolate sauce on the plate. There are just so many things on the plate, but it was plated beautifully. The flavor wasn't too creamy but fresh!\n- Vanilla bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (4/5): the reason I ordered this cuz I love creme brulee, but I was kinda disappointed since they made it a little bit too thick. I love the thin creme brulee with nice crispy on top.\n\nService and ambiance (3/5)\nI wasn't happy with the service cuz they are only super nice to the French people or their friends, maybe cuz it was a Friday evening, so they were supre busy.

I guess the upside is that the executive chef always came out to ask around how's the food. \nIt was too noisy for a fine dining restaurant and they put the small table supre close to each other, which I literally can hear the next table's convo.\n\nMaybe I would go back again on a non-busy night give a try since I heard so many good things about Chapeau!

I was in my third trimester with gestational diabetes, so I had to be careful with what I ate.  Since it was her birthday, though, I opted to splurge a bit.  I ordered their special 3 course meal, because their prices were reasonable.  I selected the escargot, the canard au miel and the baked alaska.  All were excellent, even the coffee!  The service was also excellent, and I've kept it on my list of fave restaurants.  The best thing about this meal was my blood sugar level NEVER took a hit!  When I checked my level, it was normal!  Woooooo!\n\nThen imagine my surprise when I just saw this lovely bistro featured on a crappy show like Mystery Diners!  Not only was the owner supposedly receiving complaints about the service (of which I never experienced nor witnessed while I was there), but the son was making out with the hostess?  Unless there had been a drastic change, my family and I were not greeted by an Asian-ish hostess!  We were greeted by the owner himself!  Now, I sit here confused, because it wasn't that long ago (less than a year) that I experienced such fantastic food and service at this bistro.  Perhaps things changed since my time there.  Maybe the owner added a hostess and the service mysteriously tanked since I ate there.  Given the articles I've read about Mystery Diners, I highly doubt it.\n\nEither way, I enjoyed my experience, and I won't let a bunch of malarkey like Mystery Diners taint my time there.

"], "author": "Tony L.", "review": "Let us all take a moment of silence to commemorate and celebrate Chapeau's success in putting the city of San Francisco on the world's map for fine French cuisine with an American twist.\n\nExecutive Chef Philippe Gardelle's wonderful talent of transferring his mind full of beautiful poetry into a meal can be readily appreciated by those that are fortunate enough to pay a visit to this quaint bistro on Clement.  In operation since the mid-90's up until its move to the Richmond in the fall of '09, Bay Area residents have been treated to the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" that frequently come out of the mouths of the anticipated sold-out crowds at this establishment as they peer down on their beautifully crafted plates as well as their neighbors'.\n\nIts no surprise to anyone that it requires one to make a reservation well in advance considering the space seats 49 (with an additional 12 at the bar), but Chef Philippe personally welcomes all of his patrons as if he was throwing a family dinner, every night, for a family of 49.  As you walk in, it feels as if you're immediately transported to another world (for those of you that have seen the movie \"Midnight in Paris\") by the charm and finesse of Gardelle and his well-trained staff.\n\nEven with reservations, there have been many times where there was a significant wait after the allocated time slot.  I don't blame them, it must be difficult to get people to leave their chairs here.  However, I never did mind the delay since the spacious bar is always stocked with a flurry of options for scotches, cocktails, and spirits I haven't seen anywhere else.  Its really a nice place to just have a pre-dinner glass of wine.\n\nI have never been a big fan of escargot but was willing to give it another shot with the traditional escargots de borgogne served in butter, parsley, and (yes!) garlic.  As I took a good scoop into my mouth, my taste buds quickly turned from hesitation to exhilaration and I knew right there and then that I had to prepare myself for an excellent dining experience.\n\nSome of my other favorites on the appetizer list include, but are not limited to, the french onion soup, P.E.I. mussels soup served with creme fraiche, parsley, and garlic croutons, as well as the salade landaise, which is prepared with frisee, duck confit, fingerling potato chips, and classic french vinaigrette.\n\nAs for the main course, you can never go wrong with any of their seafood options such as the wild flounder but my all-time favorite item would be the filet mignon served on a bed of pommes de terre landaise topped off with king trumpet and oyster mushrooms.  It really does excel compared to many steakhouses out there.  As such, it is usually an extra $6 to select this item on their prix-fixed menus but is well worth it.\n\nConclude your experience with the always refreshing trio of sorbet with hazelnut basket and apple compote, or one of my personal favorites, the tahtienne vanilla bean creme brulee, and you'll feel like you just had a meal fit for a king.\n\nJust to elaborate a bit more on the service, I will provide an example from one of my experiences dining here.  One time, my friend had accidentally knocked over a glass of wine on the table and immediately, several of the wait staff came over and started to clear everything off of the table.  They quickly replaced the soiled tablecloth with a brand new one (we saw the top of the table completely bare) and replaced every item in exactly the same position it was before.  They were extremely quick going about their business and within 5 minutes, it was as if it never happened and we were sitting at a new table!\n\nChapeau has clearly become my favorite French restaurant in SF and I would easily choose to go here over Gary Danko or Michael Mina.\n\nThank you Chef Philippe & company for letting the rest of us in on your passion and dedication to the craft and congratulations to your continued success!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the filet mignon with bone marrow and the Alaska salmon for our entrees.

It was actually quite loud in the restaurant seeing how each table/group is only about a foot or two away from each other. We fortunately sat next to a very nice man who was dining alone and had a lovely conversation about the food with him. (= The couple who sat to our other side, however... they would not STOP MAKING OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. I tried so hard not to throw up my precious food that was happily sitting in my stomach. I've never seen anyone PDA to this extent at an upscale restaurant. Even the group next to them whispered among themselves about it. So as a side note to the couple who sat at the corner back table on 11/23: please get yourselves a room far, far away from here.\n\n*PRICE*\nA little over $50 for a high-quality 4-course meal? What more do you want?!\n\n*SERVICE*\nThe service here is what really shined the most on top of its excellent dishes. As I mentioned earlier, I initially didn't know that the man who escorted us to our table was in fact the main chef of the restaurant. That alone says a lot about the restaurant, when the main chef performs \"normal\" duties like other staff members. I finally realized who he was when he stopped by our table after we ordered to talk about his new \"fake\" foie gras creation, which he explained with such passion and charisma and in which he was very proud of! Surprisingly, after the convo, Philippe went into the kitchen and brought out complimentary faux foie gras for us to try (it was so smooth and tasty)! Another reason why I think the service here was excellent is because no matter how late you stay to finish your meal, you never feel rushed to leave nor do they forcefully try to make you leave. We arrived at 9pm and did not leave the restaurant until a bit after 11:30pm even though the restaurant officially closed at 10pm. While we were enjoying our desserts well after 10pm, Philippe came by our table once again to check up on us and then as he walked away from us, he shouted towards the kitchen something in French and a few minutes later, out came another dessert dish which were \"compliments from the chef\"! All of the other staff members were courteous and on-point when it came to refilling water, etc. (someone even came by to fold my napkin at the table when I went to the restroom). As we were about to leave the restaurant, Philippe stopped us at the bar area and cheerfully \"demanded\" that we give him hugs and kisses (first time I ever kissed a chef on the cheek! Oh, the French!). My only regret is that we didn't take a picture with him - he is so passionate about food and so down-to-earth, and his laugh is absolutely contagious! Thank you for everything, Philippe!\n\nThis is my new favorite French restaurant! I definitely will be coming back.

Superb French meal that exceeded my expectations.  \n\nMy family and I took my mama here to celebrate her birthday and it was definitely the right choice.\n\nService:  I called two days before and luckily scored a reservation at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  We were greeted by the Chef and seated immediately.  Legit.  Our waiter had a very thick French accent, which was hard to understand at times.  He even called us madam and misses. Gentleman brownie points.  I was tempted to joke and say bonjourno monsieur but held back.\n\nThey served unlimited fresh sliced baguettes which was awesome. What was best was that we didn't have to ask the waiters for refill. They knew wassup and gave us another fresh basket right away.  We probably went through 5 baskets of those bad boys. The bread was extra crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just the way I like it. \nOh, and every time you walk away from the table or if the napkin is left unfolded on the table, ::ZOOM:: next thing you see is a waiter re-folding the napkin back in place. \n\nFood:  We all went with the prix fixed three course meal for $38.  I made sure each family member got something different so we could sample each dish.\n\nAppetizer (in order of my favorite)\n- Pan Seared Foie Gras w sliced apples (additional $6)\n- Traditional Onion Soup\n- Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, tartar & caviar, egg mimosa, fried capers & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, micro herbs with Lemon Dressing.\n- Tomato Bisque with deep fried crab cake  \n\nEverything was divine.  The Foie Gras was bomb diggity ding dongalicious.  It had a nice crisp on the outside topped with a pear glazed sauce.  Once you bite into it, it melted like butter.  That's a big statement coming from someone who usually doesn't like fatty meat.  The sliced apples gave a crisp contrast taste with the Foie Gras.\n\nThe onion soup had a great cheesy crunch on the top and right when you dive your spoon in, you enter a heaven full of melted cheese, crunchy bread bits, and onion soup.  Best part was that it wasn't overly salty like most onion soups.  One step closer to obesity? Perhaps.  Delicious?  Oh, you know it, baby.\n\nThe Trio of Salmon had a beautiful presentation.  The smoked salmon was light and complimented well with the dressing.  I actually really enjoyed the little fried capers sprinkled around, it gave a nice texture to everything.\n\nNow the only appetizer that was slightly disappointing was the crab cake with tomato bisque.  I like my crab cake extra crispy but the ball came a little soggy since it was placed in the tomato bisque.  However, the crab and the tomato bisque had a great consistency.  Dip the bread into the soup! \n\nMain Entr\u00e9e:\n- Rack of Lamb special served in a bed of au gratin\n- Filet Mignon with oyster mushrooms and stir-fried potatoes (additional $6)\n- Salmon with red bell peppers and sweet corn \n\nOut of these three entrees, the rack of lamb wins hands down.  My dad got it done medium and it was so tender, juicy, moist. Any word that makes you want to reply with \"that's what she said.\"  I wasn't a big fan of lamb until I had this perfectly cooked meat. \n\nI had the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was juicy and tender.  Not as tender as that lamb though.  The mushrooms and potatoes went great with the sauce and meat.  Best filet mignon I've ever had? No. But definitely up there. \n\nBoth my mom and bro got the Salmon for a healthier option and after trying them meats, it sure tasted healthy! It came crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  It was served with this spinach puree sauce I wished had a little more flavor so I decided to stick to my meat. \n\nOnto Dessert! Finally! \n- French Toast with soft caramel and hazelnut ice cream\n- Tahitian vanilla creme brulee\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, rum-raisin ice cream, caramel sauce.\n- Basil Napoleon maui pineapple, manilla mango, banana, kiwi & strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream\n\nFrench toast. ::drool::  Just get it. It was heavenly.  It came out warm and soft with this amazing caramel sauce and went great with the ice cream. My whole family scarfed that baby down so fast like a nascar.  \n\nThe Cr\u00e8me Bruelee came in a big portion! I likey.  I do wish the top was more crunchy, but it was light and not overly sweet.  \n\nHoly cow, did I need some milk for this Chocolate cake!  It was extremely rich and creamy.  Right when you pop that sucker out...warm chocolate oozes out so fast.  My family couldn't finish this because it was too heavy. \n\nAnything that tastes too healthy to me does not have that yummy factor.  Basil Napoleon had great chopped fruits in it but it was nothing comparable to the others..  \n\nMy parents have been to Paris multiple times and claim this was better than the meals they've had there.  Afterwards, the Chef said goodbye to us and we got to take a picture with him.  Coolios.\n\nOverall, a clutch 5 star meal.

I had pretty high expectations, but apparently when we went it was undergoing some construction.  Hopefully it looks better regularly, but I can't imagine how it might look any different.  It seemed a bit overpriced for a location in Inner Richmond and I couldn't see why the restaurant warranted a 4.5 rating.\n\nWe got the Menu 1, which allowed us to get an appetizer, entree, and dessert item for a pretty good price at $38, but you had to pay a little extra for all the foods that you actually wanted to eat.

I remember we both for the Prix-Fixe 3 course meal, i got the Trio of Salmon, Filet Mignon, and French Toast, while he got the Tiger Prawns, Duck Breast, and Creme Brulee... YUM. everything was so so good. i loved the fresh Salmon, delish. The filet Mignon was cooked to perfection with those huge mushrooms. \"drool\" the french toast however, i thougth was just ok. Not as great as i was hoping, too sweet i think. My bf on the other hand LOVED LOVED the tiger prawns. a year later, hes still talking abut it. lol. he also liked the duck breast along with the pear sauce. and the creme brulee was GOOD. i made him share. hehehe. overall, it was a great experience!

It's nice that they treat us to a complimentary amuse-bouche. haha. it was definitely amusssssing for my bouche. lol ;]\n\nso later on that year, i went for my cousins bday. we had a huge party, i think around 10 people. and they accomdated us. Service was up to par. the food was ALLLLL amazing. i tried the foie gras... omg. i can still taste it in my mouth. GOODNESS GRACIOUS. it was like heavan came down and got seared in a pan, and placed on my plate with slices of apples. hahaha. AHHH. i also got the petit poussin... goodness, chicken needs to be like that. ALL the time. hahaha. i murdered that plate. hahhaah. it was ALL gone. hehe. i didnt want to share at all...\n\nfinally...i went this weekend for my bday... lol. (yes, i guess its now a tradition) and this experience was the reason for the minus one star. Ok, maybe i am tripping, but was there a different chef? that guy did not look like Chef Phillipe... =.=', weird. lol. maybe he got a hair cut and grew out some facial hair.. but still.. ionooo. hahaha. but yes, so the menu that we oh so loved was well different. lol. i got the escargot, the salmon (even tho i wanted the petit poussin again, it wasnt available) and my bf got the sweetbread (which he really really really really really liked) LOL. he wanted to lick the plate. goodness. and he got the duck breast and duck leg... umm what. ok. so the escargot is very yummy, has plenty of flavors , and i dipped it in bread. the salmon was forgettable.. my bf said he didnt liek the fact that there were only a few peices of breast... and a leg. he wanted it to be all breast! (hahaha) and then they ran outta creme brulee. OMG. so sad. i was actually sad. like verge of tears. lol. hahaha. so i had to get the chocolate cake and by got the profilitures..(sp?) ... eh. they were ok. lol... sad facE. super sad face...\n\nso all in all..i will still return.. perhaps earlier so i can get my creme brulee.. and hopefully the Real Chef Phillipe will be there.. or um grow his hair back out. they do have an extensive wine list. and greattt service! i loveee the atmoshpere. lol.  i dont have to whisper. haha. actually its really loud in there. but yes. i still love this place!!! \n\n=]", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-06-01"}, {"excerpts": ["The four of us chose 3 course menus which consisted of filet mignon, striped bass, escargots, and goat cheese.

BAY AREA, SEASON 2: JACQUES PEPIN SPECIAL  (291)\n\nFebruary 13, 2010, Saturday, at 5:20 PM\n\nCupid must have been smiling on us this Valentine's eve.\n\nNot only we scored parking a block away at this parking nightmare neighborhood, we also snagged a table at Chapeau  without a dinner reservation before 6pm during this lovers' holiday!\n\nVENUE/AMBIANCE: Love was in the air at Chapeau--a teeny-tiny but cozy French Bistro.   The place was warm, festive (read: loud!)  and relaxed.  The tables were so closely placed together but I did not feel closed in. It was still possible to whisper \"sweet nothings\"  without being listened in by diners next to you.  I guess because the place was equally loud! Definitely not for quiet dining but I liked it this way tonight. Diners were getting more relaxed as they were enjoying their bottles of wines. (Some couples ordered 2 bottles each.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=OAc2e7WyaMSCGmY0el8EnA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=rGxHjwPLt1HnTYnkPdABFw\n\nSOCIAL SCENE: It was packed to the door and every seat was taken. Romeos of all ages wooing Juliets were at his restaurant tonight. \n\n It was nice to see old men and women dressed very nice for their dates as well as the teenager-looking young man right next to us who was obviously so uncomfortable in his suit but trying to impress his young date. (Young loves can be tragic but cute!)\n\nSERVICE: Our waiter spoke French, of course, which BF and I do not speak but he was not pretentious. Quite friendly and helpful with the menu.  Despite the tight space, the service was like a choreographed dance. Everything went smoothly during dinner. Attentive but not overbearing and we never felt hurried--just as how French dining should be.\n\nDRINK: Kir Royale for me. Nice and bubbly.\n\nAPPS:  Escargot in Garlic Sauce:  I ate a lot of snails when I was growing up in the Philippines cooked by my mom in coconut milk and squash. It's my fave! Snails are not exotic for me but they are for my BF and most Americans, I think.  We enjoyed our escargot and used our bread to clean out every last drop of the garlic sauce! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=untlhyUAbezHx3WsY8V3mA\n\nPALATE CLEANSER:  2 orders of Apple Sorbet with Calvados: Very fresh-tasting sorbet with a generous splash of apple liquor. Not only it cleaned our palate but it cleared our head. That stuff was nice and strong!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=r0KjlIrVfAZUeTy-bv_BSg\n\nAMUSE BOUCHE: 2 little cups of Cauliflower Soup compliments of the chef. So nice and creamy but I could only have a sip since it's pure cream.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=SWMDMPqI4wVqfFoXpFDVzw\n\nFILET MIGNON: (Pommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine.) BF really enjoyed this perfectly cooked medium-rare steak with potatoes. He said he wished it was bigger! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=JX4ArBrJGu-03SywpVh23w\n\nPETIT POUSSIN: (Lavender Honey & Dijon Glazed Petit Poussin\nYukon Gold Mashed Potato, White Mushrooms, Bacon & Pearl Onions, Jus de Poulet) The lavender sold me to this dish. My gosh! I'm not a poultry person but this game hen dish was so juicy and had nice deep poultry flavors.  The sauce was slightly sweet with a hint of lavender.  Very nice! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=Vb4o2-ap9k5LaJNSnzkSvQ\n\nCHOCOLATE CAKE: (Warm Chocolate Cake\nBanana Flamb\u00e9e, Rum-Raisin Ice Cream, Caramel Sauce) Perfect way to end a delighful dinner.

(4 Stars for the food and .5  Star for the unpretentious service and reasonable prices.)\n\nTAB: $111 including 20% tip and a Diet Coke. \n(We ordered everything a la carte but our server rearranged our orders into a prix fixe which saved us few dollars which was very considerate.)

We realized the quality of service and food had degraded since then our last visit 2 years ago.\n\nChef is running the floor full time now instead of in the kitchen as before. They really need a chef managing the kitchen as the food really didn't taste as good as before.\n\n\nAppetizer 1: \nPrince Edward Island Mussels:\nSteamed with White Wine, Shallot & Parsley,\nPommes Frites & Rouille. \n\nThe mussels themselves are good. The pool of white wine sauce was tooooo salty. The cropped herb was way too much and overpowered the taste of mussels. The combination caused the mussels too salty and grassy. \n\nThe fries and sauce that came with the mussels were great, but the presentation needed help. The fries were put in a paper & wire cone rack. Usually only big pieces of fries or fried food would use such a big cone rack. Tiny pieces of fries like theirs got lost in the cone. We had to \"fish\" them out.. and because the fries were so little, they began to fall out from the bottom of the cone. \n\n\nAppetizer 2: Trio of Salmon\nGravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Egg Mimosa, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche,\nMicro Herbs with Lemon Dressing\n\nWith salmon and creme fraiche, it couldn't go too bad. The dish tasted decent and presented well.\n\n\nHowever with all the messiness caused by the fries and breads, the waiter didn't bother to clean that up... Crumbs all over the table while we waited for our entrees.\n\n\nEntree 1:\nPorcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads:\nKing Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Baby Carrots & Turnips,\nTruffle Sauce, Fried Leeks, White Truffle Oil. \n\nThe presentation looked decent; the smell of truffle oil was exciting. That fried leeks was NO GOOD. It was greasy and tasted greasy. It's not crispy; it's tough to work with. By the time you can swallow the other elements, you'd still need to continue to chew on it. \nSalty & greasy. The truffle sauce was on the heavy greasy side. It tasted like their almost poured back the oil they used to sear the sweetbreads onto the plate. The sweetbreads absorbed the grease and gave me that heavy greasiness to the stomach. I went to the vegetables, expecting the baby carrots and turnips would help lightening the grease. The baby carrots were OK, but the turnips were way too salty. After that, I need to go for water to chase down the salt and grease. I could only finish 2/3. Couldn't go any further.\n\n\nEntree 2:\nFilet Mignon,\nPommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms,\nSauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine\n\nSalty & greasy. Again, it tasted like the oil that they used to cook the meat were poured back onto the dish. It caused the meat tasting greasy. The grease was absorbed by the potatoes on the plate, causing the potatoes tasted greasy as well. The skill of cooking this steak should still be refined. The dish did not perform as well as a filet mignon dish should be. \n\n\nIf they look at our order, we didn't order much wine. Either if we ordered, the entrees were still waaaay to greasy for a normal dish. \n\nWith this meal, I think I drank at least 4 glasses of water to chase down that saltiness and greasiness.\n\n\nDessert 1:\nTrio of Sorbet\n\nIt was great. Can't go too wrong with sorbet.\n\n\nDessert 2:\nTahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n\nI wish that creme brulee served either chilled or slightly warm. Room temperature of the creme brulee had a yogurt-y texture and didn't taste as good as expected... \n\n\n\nIf 2 years ago, I'd give it a 4-star... \nNow I say I'd only give maximum a 3-star.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-12-16"}, {"excerpts": ["After that came the filet mignon with a bone marrow, mushrooms and potatoes.

It was cooked to the perfect temperature, came with bone marrow and bread and tasted amazing. The meat was so tender and juicy. I am usually not a fan of Prime Rib (hence why i've never been to House of Prime Rib) but this was delicious. \n\n5. Traditional Escargots cooked in Butter, Parsley & Garlic presented inside what looks like an egg carton.. - way too salty \n\n6. Filet Mignon with potatoes and mushrooms.

However, Chapeau demystifies all these myths.  \n\n2 years later, I find myself back at Chapeau, this time at their new location; at the old Clementine.\n\nCame here last Thursday w/ reservations and it was PACKED! It seemed like a Saturday night. Although we were late for our reservations, we were promptly seated. \n\nAs we walked to our table, we were warmly greeted by the Executive Chef/Owner. Nice way to begin a good meal!\n\nFOOD:\n*Amuse Bouche of Cauliflower Soup: This was a perfect start to our meal esp when it was very cold out that night. The soup was creamy and smooth. Cauliflower can be very bland, but the soup was well seasoned to bring out the natural flavor of the cauliflower. \n\n*Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche/Micro Herbs with Lemon Dressing: MmMm! Essentially, it was fresh salmon tartar wrapped in smoked salmon and surrounded by salmon roe. The combination of flavors was amazing--Salmon roe: saltiness and zing, gravlax: smokiness, cr\u00e8me fraiche: creaminess, and tempura bits: crunch. Talk about flavor and texture explosions in your mouth.  \n\n*Bacon wrapped Veal Lion with Truffled Soft Polenta and Spinach: The veal was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Although we didn't see much bacon (perhaps it fell off), it did it's job by seasoning the veal just enough to bring out it's meaty flavor. The veal was very tender; the texture was pretty similar to what I would expect from a filet mignon but softer. I normally cringe when I hear of polenta, but my GAWD...the truffled polenta was TO DIE FOR. It was creamy, smooth, and rich. My how truffles can do wonders for a dish.\n\n*French Toast w/ Caramel Sauce and Hazelnut Vanilla Ice Cream: I'm normally not a dessert person, but I always like to order desserts when going out to a nice restaurant to see how well-rounded the place is. And, in this case the dessert is the reason why I didn't give Chapeau 5 Stars. It was toasted white bread (didn't taste the egg mixture) soaking in caramel sauce and topped w/ hazelnut vanilla ice cream. I was disappointed... the bread quickly got soggy from sitting in the caramel sauce and the ice cream. The caramel sauce was not what I expected it to be; it was very watery and milky. And, the ice cream had a very faint hazelnut taste. \n\nSERVICE: Impeccable. Our waiter who was the same waiter I has 2 years ago was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. He recommended a great California Pinot to go with our meal which was perfect. It wasn't too dry or too strong which complemented the meat well. Although we stayed there for over 3 hours and they were closing, they never rushed us.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: I actually prefer Chapeau's new location on Clement and 2nd. Upon entering in, there is a new bar area. And, the dining room is larger and the tables aren't so close together; MORE elbow room! It's very simple with hardwood floors, tan tables and chairs and crisp white table clothes. Because the place is always packed, it may be a little difficult to easily hold a conversation.\n\nCROWD: Older crowd with a handful of people in their 20s on dates. \n\nPRICES: I think Chapeau's prices are quite fair for French food. Both times, I did the menu 1 for $38 (which hasn't changed) and includes the app, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. If you opt for the foie gras, it's an additional $6, the veal or filet, an additional $6. \n\nI plan to come back very, very soon for the Prime Rib for 2 served carved table side with Bone Marrow!!! *DROOL*", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-09"}, {"excerpts": ["My mom got the filet mignon, which she wanted medium rare, and it came out PERFECTLY cooked.

Too salty to just drink on its own. I actually started dipping my bread in it. \n\nThe Fish Taste that came with Menu 2 was one seared scallop over risotto with lobster sauce: The scallop was cooked well but the green risotto it sat on was very undercooked. The crunchy uncooked bits of risotto killed the dish for my BF and I. I understand that we were one of the first tables they served for the dinner but if you didn't have time to cook the risotto all the way through... just don't serve it?! My BF couldn't stand the undercooked risotto so all he ate was the scallop.\n\nBoth the BF and I went w the 4 course option (Menu 2):\nI ordered:\nSalmon Trio: Bland in my opinion but it tasted fresh\n\nFilet mignon: I ordered medium rare and it came out perfect. The sauce and potatoes it came with were great, no complaints but nothing to write home about. I wasn't WOW'd or anything. Pretty standard, I guess.\n\nCheese plate: I ordered this for desert and the sliced apples it came with were mushy... like old apples. The grapes were mushy as well.. like they had been sitting in the fridge for a while. The cheeses were tasty but the bread it came with was not appetizing at all. The bread was cold and rubbery.

The amuse bouche was a well-prepared cauliflower soup - not totally plain, but not too salty that the simple nature of the soup was overrun.

Not the best risotto I've had, nor the best scallop, but both were done above average. By this point, we were pretty stuffed and decided to pass on some of the more aggressive dessert choices (like the chocolate cake, which read deliciously) and stuck with the trio of sorbets and the French toast. The sorbets were all fresh and a good diverse selection, but the French toast was the highlight for me - it's drizzled with caramel and is paired with a rich hazelnut ice cream. I'm a huge fan of French toast to begin with, but I've had a lot of variants as of late, and I really like what they did with it for dessert.\n\nAll in all, the meal was fantastic. I really liked the appetizers and the desserts, but I think the middle 2 portions of our 4-course meal could have been slightly stronger.

We stared at the menu and were pretty elated at what they had to offer. We ordered a bottle of wine for $37 and I thought that was a decent price. A bottle of champagne was 60+ and other wines (red and white) were rougly $40-50. \n\nThey started us off with freshly baked bread and it was toooo good. They gave us a sample of their asparagus soup and I wanted like 10 more cups considering the cup they gave it to us was smaller than an expresso cup.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nESCARGOT - Shelled and ready to go! Awesome! It was served ontop of scalloped potatoes and the flavor was just right.\n\nTRIO OF SALMON - Interesting. I didn't find 3 different types of prepared salmon in there but it was pretty good so I didn't complain.\n\nSWEETBREADS - I've never had sweetbreads before but if you think it's bread that's sweet, it's not. Haha. It's the thymus glands of some animal, I forget. The texture of sweetbreads compares to really really really soft chicken. This was paired off with a sauce that was pretty salty and mushrooms. I would order sweetbreads from here again.\n\nDUCK ENTREE - The fattiest duck I've ever had. We ordered it to be cooked at medium and there was so much fat on there I felt like I was going to chew forever. Two duck breasts sat ontop of mashed potatoes (which were good) and topped off with fruits: grapes, figs, pears. \n\nFILET MIGNON ENTREE - NO NO NO.

Bravo.\n\nThe sweetbread (a.k.a. cow thymus, or other glands.  Neither sweet, nor bread! =P) was again a very solid dish.  My advice, don't get it if you get the foie gras.  Very similar creamy, rich animal organ texture that was already achieved better with the foie gras.  Also, the sauce on the sweetbread is the same as what is on the Filet Mignon.

But at $13 for a meager pour, I was hoping for better.\n\nThe desserts allow Chapeau! to redeem itself.  The thinly sliced french toast had the crust removed and is drizzled in a light, caramelly/mapley sauce that I can't quite identify, and the Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream on top was decadent.  The french toast barely had any egg yolk flavor and you could tell that a lot of care went into making this dessert.  \n\nMy chocolate cake (lava cake style) was very good, but Roy's has perfected that dish and Chapeau fell short of Roy.  But the Rum ice cream paired with it was something special; as rich as it could be, and as full of Rum flavor as ice cream can hold.\n\nLike everyone says, the chef is a wonderful host and kisses my significant other on the cheeks on her way out.\n\nAll in all, bi-polar gastronomy gets the belly full, and gives the emotional centers of our brains a roller coaster ride.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Boyfriend had the filet mignon, medium rare.

It was one crostini so naturally I wanted more!\n- Foie Gras: The portion was generous. It was served on brioche with slices of apples. I prefer mine with a some sort of fruit reduction so their version lacked sauce for me; however, the foie gras was rich and delicious as always. \n-Skate Wing: I chose to stray from my norm and ordered fish ....WOW! BEST FISH I've ever had hands down. It's served in a brown butter sauce but there was a slight lemon taste that complemented the fish perfectly. The flaky, tender fish sat on a bed little bread croutons and potatoes. My favorite green salad, mache , also accompanied it. Ive  never had mache warm before but it worked with the dish/sauce.

It was meringue atop coffee ice cream atop rum cake in a chocolate sauce. The best part was the ice cream inside.

This was my favorite dish of the night. It had the right amount of cheesiness, and the crunch from the salad and the tartness from the balsamic complemented the dish very well. My brother got the corn soup. It was very creamy and had a ton of corn flavor. Both of the appetizers were exceptional.\n\nI got the filet mignon for my entree.

It's nice and seems very fancy smancy, but you don't have to dress that way.  Everyone seemed to be in pretty casual wear.  Dim lights with a romantic ambiance to it.  Perfect place for dates.\n\nThe owner and his wife are super friendly. They walked around greeting their customers and making sure everything was ok. Our waiter= superb. Service was excellent here. I was very satisfied with just that alone.\n\nWe had:\n\nFish and potato taster:\nThis was complimentary from the chef. It was a nice little surprise. I thought the fact that it came out in a little spoon was so cute! Fits perfectly into the mouth. I really enjoyed this little teaser. I really like potatoes and fish so it satisfied my taste buds.\n\nTrio of Salmon:\nGravlax, tartar and caviar/egg mimosa, fried capers and creame friache/ microherbs with lemon dressing\nThis appetizer was delicious. The salmon was full of flavor and was a very refreshing appetizer. It was definitely one of our favorites that night. The checkered chip on top reminded me of potato chips. Loved the presentation as well as the taste of this dish. YUMMY!\n\nPrince Edwards Island Mussels:\nsteamed with white wine, shallot and parsley\nI love mussels. The sauce was awesome and very tasty. I dipped our complimentary bread into the sauce and let it soak into the bread. YUM! I loved the taste of parsley, it made it taste really refreshing!\n\nPommes Frites and Rouille:\nIt reminds me of In and Out's fries. I have nothing to complain about that, I just wouldn't expect it at a fine dining restaurant. Nothing too special, but the sauce was delicious!\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse\nCanelli beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder/ duck leg confit/ garlic and toulouse sausage\nThis dish tasted the way it looked, very unappetizing. I was very dissappointed in not only the presentation of the dish but the taste as well. The excessive amount of beans reminded me of Mexican food. I barely tasted the lamb or the duck, although the sausages were definitely there. I was expecting more from an upscale restaurant like Chapeau!.\n\nFilet Mignon with Foie Gras\nwith oyster and lobster mushrooms and potatoes\nThe waiter recommended us to get this with the foie gras and so we did. I think it was my first time trying foie gras. The waiter was right, the filet mignon tasted really good with the foie gras. I don't think I could have had the whole dish to myself because the foie gras itself is very rich, thus making the dish very rich. When eating the foie gras with the filet mignon, its best to just get a little piece of foie gras to go with the meat, otherwise it's too rich.\n\nBasil Napoleon\nMaui Pineapple, Manilla Mango, Banana, Kiwi & Strawberries/\nChampagne-Citrus Pastry Cream/ Feuille de Bric\nVery refreshing dessert. It's not overwhelming with sweetness. It had natural sweetness from all the fruits. After having such a rich dessert like the french toast, it was perfect. Tasted nice amd healthy. I felt good eating it.\n\nFrench Toast\nBest dessert there!! It's seriously delicious. Who would have ever thought that french toast as a dessert would be so good! I loved how it was warm and there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top drizzled with a little bit of caramel. Heaven in my mouth!!\n\nBanana Panna Cotta\nStrawberry Salad/ Shortbread \nThe strawberries weren't that fresh and a little bit on the sweet side, but the shortbread was delicious. Out of the 3 desserts, this was my least favorite. It was still pretty good, but just my least favorite.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed EVERYTHING except my dish the Cassoulet de Toulouse with canelli beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder/ duck leg confit/ garlic and toulouse sausage", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-04-23"}, {"excerpts": ["like many other yelpers, we enjoyed the french onion soup, the foie gras, and the filet mignon with MORE foie gras on top.

When I made this reservation, I read a yelp review that mentioned their souffle and I thought, YES, finally Souffle!! My whole family LOVES LOVES souffle.. in fact, sometimes after eating out we contemplate going to Mortons just to order one of their souffles.  Let's face it - a souffle is not easy to get and not many restaurants have them because you need an on-site pastry chef.  A tip for all you souffle lovers out there: YOU NEED TO CALL AT LEAST 24 HRS PRIOR TO YOUR RESERVATION IF YOU WANT TO ORDER A SOUFFLE AT YOUR DINNER.  Contrary to the normal \"30 minutes advanced notice\" only applies to restaurants with an on-site pastry chef.  Actually, that was the first question I asked when we were seated - \"we're going to order souffle\".  I was seriously crushed when I was told the sad news.  I wish I had known that was an option!  I guess I just figured that an upscale FRENCH restaurant would serve souffle :(  Instead I ordered their chocolate lava cake which was a total mistake haha. Not a fan.. but nothing comes close to what I wanted.\n\nThe creme brulee was good, same taste as it should have - no complaints there.  My sister had the Baked Alaska but wasn't a huge fan.  The rest ordered the sorbet or the chocolate cake - but since I started the rumor that they had souffle the chocolate cake didn't stand a chance.  My mom on the other hand ordered their french toast.  Who would have thought something that sounded so simple could have such a unique and amazing taste!  Actually, her dessert came out after everyone else finished theirs for some reason, which didn't matter much to her because she was full, and so were we... but once we had a taste of that toast, we all chowed down like we hadn't had a meal in days.  \n\nThe chef also came out to shake everyone's hands and introduce himself which I thought was very nice of him to take the time to do that.  He must love what he does and it's nice that he came out to actually see everyone who was dining there.  Very nice touch.  \n\nI had to take down 1 star solely based on my disappointment on their dessert.  I would definitely come back again.

The mister got the Menu 1 ( which contains one appetizer, entree and dessert) . I got the Menu 2 ( which has one appetizer, a tasting fish , entree and dessert) alongwith the Colonel (which is a palette cleanser. \n\nMister's Menu1\nAppetizer - Trio of Salmon\nHe said that this was his least favorite of all the things he had ordered because the salmon did not taste fresh\n\nEntree-  Rack of Lamb \nIt was delish. It was done just right and accompanied by a gorgeous sauce and a potato au gratin\n\nDessert - Fruit plate in a coconut flakes cup\nThe mister said this was the best thing ever. It had a creamy custardy base topped with seasonal fruits in a toasted coconut flakes cup . I was too busy eating my dessert that  I never tried his dessert but judging by the sheer delight on his face :) I could tell it was good\n\nMy Menu2\nAppetizer -Veal Sweetbreads\nPLEASE order this. The first bite into the sweetbread and you  know you are eating high quality stuff and the sauce was to die for.\n\nTasting fish \nThe tasting fish was fixed and it was a scallop surrounded by a bed of pesto risotto. Need I say more. The risotto was cooked to perfection and the scallop was just right , not chewy but felt just right .\n\nPalette Cleanser- Colonel\nThis was a lime sorbet with vodka. It was sharp, cold and set me up for my entree \n\nEntree-  Filet Mignon (medium) with Bone marrow\nI am not a bone marrow fan but the mister is and we ordered the bone marrow (You pay an additional 6$ if you order the bone marrow) . Once again the meat was cooked to order and it came with a great sauce but what struck me most were the cubed potatoes. These were baked and fried I think but they were so delish.\nThe bone marrow however I think is a waste of money. Our bone did not have enough marrow in it \n\nDessert - Profiteroles\nI have a soft corner for Profiteroles ( That's an understatement !) . I love it when I bite into the puff and then I am hit with the cold cream and the chocolate sauce . Never go wrong with it. This was another winner.\n\nThe bill for two was around 175$ which includes additional amounts for  a few glasses of wine as well.\nLoved the ambiance and the price point for the quality of food you get here is great. The executive chef was there to say us goodbye on our way out .\nWill we come back here ? -  I think we will .\n\nPS: I loved the small flower holders on the tables.

Her husband Philippe Gardelle is the chef.  \n\nHospitality plays a major role in the dining experience and her warm welcome is parallel to the cozy yet sharp ambiance.\n\nOnto the food,...\n\nFrench fare is all about core ingredients but cooked with different techniques.\n\nA few appetizers stand out.  Succulent escargot presents an earthy tone served over quarter sized potatoes (a bit under cooked). Skip the oysters, they were small in size and the dressing made no splash.\n\nhint: I order food that makes the chef work. Meaning, order things you can not make at home and requires testing the chef's technique.\nOyster with a few splashes of dressing, not too hard.\n\nThe French onion is one of the best in the Bay Area.  The full bodied soup displays sweet tones from tender onions along with a layer of cheese that did not over power the dish.\n\nAll the while, close your eyes and immerse yourself in the ambiance.  With soft color tone walls and service that is on key, the meal continued with grace.  \n\nFor the entree, duck meat cooked medium rare is fanned out bathing in a sweet and savory sauce.  Another dish on point was the filet mignon, but nothing spectacular.   \n\nBlushing pink meat make up the rack of lamb with artichoke.\n  \nWe tried the 3 course menu and opted to choose two appetizers and one main course.\nFor a table of four, the total cost including tip rounded out to $200.\n\nFor my sister's birthday, Ellen (co-owner) graciously presented a cr\u00e8me brulee with a candle.\nBy the time dessert had arrived, I was filled.  Generous portions and rich sauces make up a heavy meal.\n\nWhen leaving, Ellen chased us down to thank us for coming.\nFor an evening with someone special, you can't go wrong with Chapeau.\n\nComment for owner: I would like to see more creative seafood entr\u00e9e courses.  Lamb, beef, salmon tend to lack sizzle.\n\nMy favories. {Gary Danko, Masa, Bistro LeZinc}", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["For entree we both had the filet mignon, although mine was overdone they took it back without question and second time it was cooked perfectly.

"], "author": "Gourmet Princessa L.", "review": "This little French bistro in the Richmond district is almost hidden from the street. I've been here twice and each time with different people and the feedback from my guests was consistent - good price for a 3-course pre-fixed dinner for moderate French cuisine, but the add costs on certain items on the menu and side order of foie gras were not worth it. \n\nI thought the French cuisine at Chapeau was not spectacular. Do they use good quality meat, seafood and vegetables? Yes, they do. Do they service with a smile and make the diners feel welcome and comfortable, they sure did. In fact, the executive chef himself was on the floor roaming from table to table checking on his patrons and occasionally chatting up a few conversations and when we were leaving the restaurant, he bid us farewell at the door and saw us off. On my second visit, we left without the knowledge of the chef, he even ran out of the restaurant to say goodbye to us on the street. Service was great! 5 stars for that. \n\nI'm afraid I couldn't say the same about the food. I could only appoint Chapeau 3 stars. No doubt the ingredients were good, but the execution was nothing to brag about. The $38 pre-fixed 3-course menu consists of an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert that you pick from their regular menu. Depending on which entr\u00e9e you pick, there might be additional costs to it. \n\nOn my first visit, I had the duck leg confit casserole with white beans, my guest has the rack of lamb cooked to medium rare. There was nothing impressive or particular outstanding about the 2 entrees that deserve to write home about. My casserole was very heavy and the flavor was a little bland. It was a dish meant for sharing because after a few bite, your taste buds are bored with the same taste and one texture dish - mushy beans and duck meat that was too overcooked that the meat was too soft. My guest's rack of lamb was fine, although slightly better than my dish. The portion was enough to satisfy our hunger. \n\nI gave Chapeau a second chance and returned the second time to try other things on the menu. On my second visit, I had the appetizer of duck breast with fris\u00e9e salad and surprisingly it was much better than the duck casserole entr\u00e9e. They should have just put that on the entr\u00e9e menu. My guest had the Trio of Salmon appetizer and the filet mignon and she thought both dishes were fine. Foie gras was on the menu, but with additional charge. We ordered one to share. The serving was small and a little undercooked for my taste. The foie gras has a little gelatinous texture to it and it wasn't seared well on the outside. \n\nDesserts were the typical tarts, cr\u00e8me brulee, and sorbet. Boring, boring, boring. \n\nIf you ask me will I go to Chapeau again, I can tell you without hesitant that most likely not. I know I seemed harsh on my review, but I had better French food and the city offers many French restaurants that have better French food, why go all the way out in the Richmond just for that?

We also had a couple of glasses of wine, slightly overpriced but not terrible.  We weren't set that we were going to be getting the prix fixe menu, and we started with 1 appetizer to split between us, we each had an entree, and then we made the decision to go for a dessert to split. We were both disappointed that they didn't turn one of our meals into the prix fixe price when they did that for the people sitting next to us. We did not argue the point, which we should have, so some of the fault is our's, but I would expect at a good restaurant that it would be automatically done.\n\nAmbiance: It's VERY noisy inside due to the small space (we actually had to move the table so one of us could sit down). We could hear the entire conversation on both sides of us. We're not from SF or a large city, so this may be standard and maybe people from the city are so used to it that it doesn't bother them at all, but we had a hard time with it.\n\nStaff: Our waiter left a lot to be desired. We were uncomfortable on several occasions. There was just a big discrepancy between how we were treated and how some of the other tables were treated.\n\nFood: Delicious.  We had the black tiger prawn appetizer - 3 prawn wrapped in phylo dough (I think it was phylo dough) with tomato and onion was delicious. She had the filet mignon which was perfect.

The tables are RIGHT next to each other and the decor is bland.  It is very beige in there and it feels like it is missing something.  Also the bathrooms was sloppily done - they chose a tile to match the existing tile, but it didn't match very well.  Makes me wonder a bit what they do in the kitchen...

We were both exited to go as we had been to Clementine last year which we enjoyed tremendously, which is apparently owned by the same person as Chapeau.\nAnyhow, the hosts and service staff were very polite and attentive and did their job well.  However, from what I could tell, all of the service staff were either Asian or Latino.  That was the first bummer, we were all set to try out our french and there was no one to converse with.  \n\nThe meal was paced well and we were allowed to take our time and we really appreciated this.  This was starting to feel a little more French.\nA real downer was the staffs lack of knowledge of french wines.   In my opinion French wines are like mysteries that need to be explained to truly appreciate each unique bottle.  We were advised by a very well intentioned Asian gentleman to try a Grand Cru from the  Bordeaux region.  We were told it was very \"smooth\", which I kinda chuckled when I heard that.  Anyhow, I asked what grapes comprised the wine and he was not able to tell me.  When I pressed him on it he said Cabernet.  Any of you wine buffs out there know that French wines are mostly blends, that is part of their craft and pride.  He just didn't know what he was talking about and did not bother to find out for me.   I was thinking, IS THIS REALLY A FRENCH RESTAURANT?  That bummed me out.\n\nNow to the food, I enjoyed the appetizers, the blini with caviar and salmon in pastry was very nice, they both featured the fish very well and did not overpower the intent.  The oyster was good but I would have expected it in a restaurant know for Ceviche more than French food. \nOn to the pancetta wrapped fish on risotto, this was good but not great. \nAfter the fish, they served us a filet mignon with truffle butter, asparagus and mashed parsnip.  This pairing was excellent and in my opinion a perfectly balanced classic french entree, very nicely done.\nDessert must have been uneventful as I cannot recall what we had.\n\nSo this is my take, If your going to ask $350 for a French meal for two, I would expect that all of the elements come together perfectly.  Knowledgeable French staff, excellent French wine with  someone who knows and understands French wine, Slow French Pace to let us enjoy our meal  and of course delicious French Food.  I would have been down to say this meal should have fetched about $150 bones at best.\n\n So I am giving Chapeau 3 stars, wish it were better, but these guys need to bring the \"French\" back into their French Restaurant.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Filet Mignon - tender, cooked just right to med-rare.\n", "5.

They have no hostess stand either.  Our server eventually ended up seating us at a 2-top which I thought was odd considering they had sooo many tables open.  Before we got seated, my date even asked if I wanted to leave! (yes, it was that odd).\n\nWe finally got seated and the server asked us if we would like to start with a drink before dinner.  We both knew we wanted wine but no wine list had been provided!  She asked him (but not me) \"sparkling or still\" and then walked away.  The inattentive service stopped there.

Her husband got the pork tenderloin and it was a bit on the bland side, as well.  When the server came over to ask how our entrees were, my friend told him the filet was overcooked.  The server was very nice about it and apologized and offered to take it back, but since they already ate half of it, they didn't want to make a big fuss.  To make it up to us, they gave us 2 desserts on the house, in addition to the ones we already ordered.  That put our total to 7 desserts.  LOL.  It was definitely dessert overload.  I really enjoyed the napoleon, surprisingly.  I didn't think I would like it but I really enjoyed how fresh it was with the all the fruits.  It definitely wasn't like a traditional napoleon.  My other favorite was the profiteroles.  The french toast was interesting since I would typically associate that with breakfast rather than dessert.  It was a bit sweet for me because of the caramel they drizzled on top, but my hubby really liked it.  Overall, the experience at Chapeau was good but not great.

Given the nearly unanimously stellar reviews, it was with very high expectations that I dined at this outer Richmond favorite.  Needless to say , I was very much let down. \n\nFirst off, when you first walk into the place you enter a closet sized curtained enclosure where you are expected to wait for your table.  This we did with another couple.  It felt like all four of us were playing seven minutes in heaven except it was more like 10 minutes and there was no making out.  Thats pretty minor for me, I'm not a big complainer...just pointing it out.  As for the service...It was all very much well-intentioned I suppose, but it was all over the place.  Similar to reviewer andy, we literally had about four different waiters, none of whom paid any real attention to us.  \n\nThen there is Phillipe...Highly touted for his signature \"french\" kisses.  Again I agree with Andy in that the whole thing seems kind of gimmicky now.  When we left we were about a block away when I hear running from behind...I swear I thought I was getting rolled on by gangstas.  Sure enough it was Phillipe, as promised, with the kisses.  \n\nThe worst part of the whole evening for me ,though , had to do with the wine service. After laboring to find the perfect Bordeaux for the night, Phillipe comes over and presents the bottle to my date.  \"What's this?\" I ask myself...\"could Phillipe be mistaken about who ordered (and who's paying)?\"  I mean after all I think it was the busboy who took my wine order so its very possible.  Phillipe continues to pour the taster for my date, who at this point is equally baffled, and then pours himself a small glass.  He toasts my date as they both sip the wine and I stare in disbelief.  I cant imagine anyone who doesn't know that the person who ordered always taste first before the guest is served.  And that he poured himself a taste?!?!?.. Don't get me wrong if he had employed the proper serving method I would have gladly poured him a healthy glass.  But it was almost as if he wanted to pull the whole \"smooth french guy hitting on the american dude's chick\"  thing.   That little move really turned me off from the beginning.\n\nThe food...yeah its good, but not nearly as good as the reviews suggest.  I can't claim any expertise on french food, but what we had was enjoyable.  Mussels, brie, cassoulet, filet mignon and creme brulee...All as part of the prix fixe deal, which is quite reasonable.

It would have been very, very good had the main vegetarian course not been sweet, too.

In retrospect, this was WAY more food than I ever wanted, but I'm glad we picked it if only for the delicious tasting fish. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the trio of salmon and salade landaise. The salmon was fresh, but I enjoyed the duck salad quite a bit more. The different versions of duck (smoked duck breast, duck confit, and duck liver pate) in the salad were all wonderfully flavored, and the frisee provided a good complement and palate cleanser for all the different tastes. The potato chips on top were a nice touch, too. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" ended up being a delectable scallop surrounded by a creamy pesto risotto. Probably the best part of the meal, to be honest -- highly recommend!  \n\nOur entrees were the skate wing and the cassoulet de toulouse. The skate wing was fresh and tender, but the flavors weren't as complex as I would've liked. The lamb shoulder in the cassoulet was to die for! Juicy with a great texture and hearty mix of flavors... I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it. \n\nBy the time we ordered our desserts, I felt like my stomach was going to explode. As a result, I only ate a few bites of my French toast with salted caramel ice cream, but the few bites I had were amaaaaaazing. The French toast was warm, fresh, and fluffy. The ice cream itself was dense and creamy (and maybe a little too sweet). We also ordered the trio of sorbet (lemon, blackberry, and mango). The sorbets tasted light and natural -- we liked the blackberry flavor the most. \n\nOur waiter was attentive, helpful, and very French. He helped us pick a Santenay pinot noir as a companion to our meal. The wine was flowery and not too heavy, with a flavor that easily permeated throughout the meal. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe about this restaurant is that they sat us VERY close to the next table. There was probably an inch of space between us. Our neighbors were also very loud (thanks to the level of noise in the room, you have to speak up to be heard across the table), which definitely detracted from my experience. Though the lighting is dark and the decor is romantically European, Chapeau! may not be the best location for a quiet, intimate dinner. \n\nI am a sucker for cute little perks like the glittery hat they place your bill in (chapeau means hat in French), and getting to meet the chef at the end of the meal.

Sorry, can't recall our waiter's name, but he spoke French. He was very funny and asked us to order in French....well the question was directed to my daughter:). \n\nWe ordered the 3 course( prefix meal for about $45.  My daughter ordered the appetizer corn soup, entre mussels and pome frites, dessert warm chocolate cake. I ordered the escargot and the white fish in a broth, but didn't know I had to drink the broth. The soup was very rich and tasty. The fresh French bread was hot when provided prior to appetizers, very soft, and crunchy on the outside, the best. Forgot to ask if bread is made there or not.  The corn soup was very rich, sweet and tasty. The escargot had quite a bit of garlic, but very yummy and hot, so be careful not to burn yourself.\n\nThe waiter showed us how to eat the mussel the French style by using one shell and pulling the muscle out of the other shell, which was new to us. My daughter loved the mussels, garlic, wine soup base, French fries, she ate everything.\n\nMy halibut was tasty as well with the crunchy kale, bread with melted cheese. Didn't know the halibut came in a soup broth, until the chef/owner came out to explain how to eat the meal.  Normally, the chef/owner comes out of the kitchen to greet his patrons.\n\nLastly, the dessert, warm chocolate cake takes about 20 minutes to make. My daughter was so full, she refused to eat the cake at first, then gobbled the entire dish up. I ordered the trio of sorbet...just perfect, very light, but finished the mango and raspberry flavored.

In operation since the mid-90's up until its move to the Richmond in the fall of '09, Bay Area residents have been treated to the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" that frequently come out of the mouths of the anticipated sold-out crowds at this establishment as they peer down on their beautifully crafted plates as well as their neighbors'.\n\nIts no surprise to anyone that it requires one to make a reservation well in advance considering the space seats 49 (with an additional 12 at the bar), but Chef Philippe personally welcomes all of his patrons as if he was throwing a family dinner, every night, for a family of 49.  As you walk in, it feels as if you're immediately transported to another world (for those of you that have seen the movie \"Midnight in Paris\") by the charm and finesse of Gardelle and his well-trained staff.\n\nEven with reservations, there have been many times where there was a significant wait after the allocated time slot.  I don't blame them, it must be difficult to get people to leave their chairs here.  However, I never did mind the delay since the spacious bar is always stocked with a flurry of options for scotches, cocktails, and spirits I haven't seen anywhere else.  Its really a nice place to just have a pre-dinner glass of wine.\n\nI have never been a big fan of escargot but was willing to give it another shot with the traditional escargots de borgogne served in butter, parsley, and (yes!) garlic.  As I took a good scoop into my mouth, my taste buds quickly turned from hesitation to exhilaration and I knew right there and then that I had to prepare myself for an excellent dining experience.\n\nSome of my other favorites on the appetizer list include, but are not limited to, the french onion soup, P.E.I. mussels soup served with creme fraiche, parsley, and garlic croutons, as well as the salade landaise, which is prepared with frisee, duck confit, fingerling potato chips, and classic french vinaigrette.\n\nAs for the main course, you can never go wrong with any of their seafood options such as the wild flounder but my all-time favorite item would be the filet mignon served on a bed of pommes de terre landaise topped off with king trumpet and oyster mushrooms.  It really does excel compared to many steakhouses out there.  As such, it is usually an extra $6 to select this item on their prix-fixed menus but is well worth it.\n\nConclude your experience with the always refreshing trio of sorbet with hazelnut basket and apple compote, or one of my personal favorites, the tahtienne vanilla bean creme brulee, and you'll feel like you just had a meal fit for a king.\n\nJust to elaborate a bit more on the service, I will provide an example from one of my experiences dining here.  One time, my friend had accidentally knocked over a glass of wine on the table and immediately, several of the wait staff came over and started to clear everything off of the table.  They quickly replaced the soiled tablecloth with a brand new one (we saw the top of the table completely bare) and replaced every item in exactly the same position it was before.  They were extremely quick going about their business and within 5 minutes, it was as if it never happened and we were sitting at a new table!\n\nChapeau has clearly become my favorite French restaurant in SF and I would easily choose to go here over Gary Danko or Michael Mina.\n\nThank you Chef Philippe & company for letting the rest of us in on your passion and dedication to the craft and congratulations to your continued success!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We finished our 2 hour meal with the trio of sorbet: meyer lemon, mango and black currant.

When we arrived, we were greeted by none other than Executive Chef Philippe himself (although I did not know who he was at that time!). With a welcoming smile and handshake, he immediately escorted us to our table. After a server came to explain to us how the menu worked, we decided to order \"Menu 2,\" which was the 4-course menu.\n\n*FOOD*\nI ordered the French onion soup (appetizer), scallop with basil risotto (tasting fish), filet mignon (entree), and french toast w/ salted caramel ice cream (dessert). We also got complimentary dishes (which I will mention in the \"Service\" section below)! To start off, the soup was perfect! The scallop dish was simply exquisite, especially the risotto which I am obsessed about (it wasn't too creamy nor too dry). I pretty much had to hold back tears at that point, hah! I do wish the dish consisted of more than one scallop, though. As for the filet mignon, although the meat came out to be medium rare as requested, it was slightly chewy and not as tender as other filet mignons I've had where the meat easily sliced away with a knife. It wasn't anything bad, but it was not the best piece of filet mignon I've had - the potato and mushroom accompaniment were very good though! As for dessert, it was the best French toast I've ever had (and what they recommended too)! The salted caramel ice cream that came with the toast really balanced out the taste of the French toast and although the dessert sounds super sweet, it really wasn't overwhelmingly sweet at all!\n\n\"J\" pretty much had the same courses as me, except for his trio of salmon (appetizer) and trio of sorbet (dessert). The trio of salmon was delicious and a must-have if you like raw fish. The trio of sorbet was nothing special so I suggest choosing another dessert that's more worthwhile.\n\n*DECOR/AMBIANCE*\nThe restaurant itself is rather small and the decor is nothing spectacular, but if you want a place where you can have a quiet conversation with someone, this might not be the place. It was actually quite loud in the restaurant seeing how each table/group is only about a foot or two away from each other. We fortunately sat next to a very nice man who was dining alone and had a lovely conversation about the food with him. (= The couple who sat to our other side, however... they would not STOP MAKING OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. I tried so hard not to throw up my precious food that was happily sitting in my stomach. I've never seen anyone PDA to this extent at an upscale restaurant. Even the group next to them whispered among themselves about it. So as a side note to the couple who sat at the corner back table on 11/23: please get yourselves a room far, far away from here.\n\n*PRICE*\nA little over $50 for a high-quality 4-course meal? What more do you want?!\n\n*SERVICE*\nThe service here is what really shined the most on top of its excellent dishes. As I mentioned earlier, I initially didn't know that the man who escorted us to our table was in fact the main chef of the restaurant. That alone says a lot about the restaurant, when the main chef performs \"normal\" duties like other staff members. I finally realized who he was when he stopped by our table after we ordered to talk about his new \"fake\" foie gras creation, which he explained with such passion and charisma and in which he was very proud of! Surprisingly, after the convo, Philippe went into the kitchen and brought out complimentary faux foie gras for us to try (it was so smooth and tasty)! Another reason why I think the service here was excellent is because no matter how late you stay to finish your meal, you never feel rushed to leave nor do they forcefully try to make you leave. We arrived at 9pm and did not leave the restaurant until a bit after 11:30pm even though the restaurant officially closed at 10pm. While we were enjoying our desserts well after 10pm, Philippe came by our table once again to check up on us and then as he walked away from us, he shouted towards the kitchen something in French and a few minutes later, out came another dessert dish which were \"compliments from the chef\"! All of the other staff members were courteous and on-point when it came to refilling water, etc. (someone even came by to fold my napkin at the table when I went to the restroom). As we were about to leave the restaurant, Philippe stopped us at the bar area and cheerfully \"demanded\" that we give him hugs and kisses (first time I ever kissed a chef on the cheek! Oh, the French!). My only regret is that we didn't take a picture with him - he is so passionate about food and so down-to-earth, and his laugh is absolutely contagious! Thank you for everything, Philippe!\n\nThis is my new favorite French restaurant! I definitely will be coming back.

The pool of white wine sauce was tooooo salty. The cropped herb was way too much and overpowered the taste of mussels. The combination caused the mussels too salty and grassy. \n\nThe fries and sauce that came with the mussels were great, but the presentation needed help. The fries were put in a paper & wire cone rack. Usually only big pieces of fries or fried food would use such a big cone rack. Tiny pieces of fries like theirs got lost in the cone. We had to \"fish\" them out.. and because the fries were so little, they began to fall out from the bottom of the cone. \n\n\nAppetizer 2: Trio of Salmon\nGravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Egg Mimosa, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche,\nMicro Herbs with Lemon Dressing\n\nWith salmon and creme fraiche, it couldn't go too bad.

Crumbs all over the table while we waited for our entrees.\n\n\nEntree 1:\nPorcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads:\nKing Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Baby Carrots & Turnips,\nTruffle Sauce, Fried Leeks, White Truffle Oil. \n\nThe presentation looked decent; the smell of truffle oil was exciting. That fried leeks was NO GOOD. It was greasy and tasted greasy. It's not crispy; it's tough to work with. By the time you can swallow the other elements, you'd still need to continue to chew on it. \nSalty & greasy. The truffle sauce was on the heavy greasy side. It tasted like their almost poured back the oil they used to sear the sweetbreads onto the plate. The sweetbreads absorbed the grease and gave me that heavy greasiness to the stomach. I went to the vegetables, expecting the baby carrots and turnips would help lightening the grease. The baby carrots were OK, but the turnips were way too salty. After that, I need to go for water to chase down the salt and grease. I could only finish 2/3. Couldn't go any further.\n\n\nEntree 2:\nFilet Mignon,\nPommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms,\nSauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine\n\nSalty & greasy. Again, it tasted like the oil that they used to cook the meat were poured back onto the dish. It caused the meat tasting greasy. The grease was absorbed by the potatoes on the plate, causing the potatoes tasted greasy as well. The skill of cooking this steak should still be refined. The dish did not perform as well as a filet mignon dish should be. \n\n\nIf they look at our order, we didn't order much wine. Either if we ordered, the entrees were still waaaay to greasy for a normal dish. \n\nWith this meal, I think I drank at least 4 glasses of water to chase down that saltiness and greasiness.\n\n\nDessert 1:\nTrio of Sorbet\n\nIt was great.

I remember when Chef Philippe first opened Clemetine, which was the restaurant at the current location, and eventually just merged them into the newer location with the name Chapeau! This restaurant is divine. The atmosphere is elegant but also casual. It isn't unusual to find people dressed nicely in formal wear, but most wear semiformal, semi casual clothes, with jeans actually quite common (especially at the bar section). All the servers are polite, with Philippe's wife acting as the manager. The waiters really do know what they are doing, and while I do not believe they have a designated sommelier, they do have a fine selection of wine. One of the best aspects of dinner here is that Philippe always comes out as customers are eating and goes to every table and greets them. He'll grab a glass and pour himself a glass and toast with you and chat for a bit. This fun, friendly, and warm environment just cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nNow, finally onto the food.

Meaning, we never would've discovered this place if it wasn't for yelp.  It's kinda in a residential area of the Richmond district between 2nd and 3rd.  It took about a 20-25 min cab ride out of downtown SF to actually get to this place, but it was well worth it.  We dined here a few days after Christmas... \n\nWe got there for an early reservation right when they opened up for dinner service.  The ambiance is upscale, but casual...clientele was very eclectic, from young & old couples to families.  Some were dressed in jackets while others wore jeans and t-shirts.    \n\nService was charming, friendly and prompt.  All of the waiters had French accents and appeared to be speaking French to one another.  Our waiter gave us his honest opinions of what he personally thought tasted the best that evening.  Food service pace can best be described as European, so this may not be your cup of tea if you're in a rush to get in and out of this place.  We enjoyed the leisurely pace, and never felt rushed although the restaurant was packed to the gills.   \n\nStarted off with the appetizer-sized portion of Porcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms/ Baby Carrots & Turnips/Truffle Sauce/ Fried Leeks/ White Truffle Oil, and my wife had a salad of some sorts with mixed beets.  Light crisp coating surrounding moist and flavorful sweetbreads...\n\nEntree:  Vegetable Napoleon made of Barley & Wheat/ Lentils with Dried Fruits & Toasted Almonds/Curry Cauliflower Mousse/ Artichoke Dome/ Green Curry Sauce.  My wife is a vegetarian and loved this dish...such an usual and creative dish with such artistic presentation that we've never seen before.   \n\nEntree:  Veal Medalion with Chanterelles in a Veal Reduction\nTruffled Soft Polenta/ Spinach Soubise.  Perfectly cooked veal with an outstanding polenta that was chock full of chanterelles in a super-rich veal reduction...what more can you ask for? \n\nDessert:  Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  I thought this was just 'okay,' but it probably wasn't the best dessert to top off such a rich dinner. \n\nUnfortunately, they dimmed the lights right before our food was served so none of my cell phone photos came out, but take my word for it, everything except dessert was super-delicious!  The portions were unusually large for French cuisine and the sauces were just spectacular...and they did not skimp on the use of butter.  This food is not for the weight-watchers crowd...but what the hell? Ya gotta live a little sometimes...\n\nThe only downfall, if you need to grab a cab back to downtown SF...make sure you call for a cab from the restaurant.  It took us about 15-20 minutes to hail a cab on the street.

Problem solved!\n\nThe meal started innocuously with a super flavorful, crusty bread with butter that had just enough salt. An amuse bouche of cauliflower soup was served, which would actually become my favorite dish I had all night. It was perfectly seasoned and finished off with a drop of truffle oil. (Truffle oil is one of those ingredients that is somewhat looked down upon by master chefs since it is basically just a manufactured aromatic and not actually a truffle-infused oil. While I wouldn't serve it to Chef Ramsey, I do enjoy a drop or two in my favorite dishes.)\n\nFor our first course, my girlfriend and I enjoyed their trio of salmon and a creamy yellow corn soup.  The salmon was served as stack with gravlax, tartare, and caviar, with egg mimosa, fried capers, and creme fraiche and the soup was served with a deep fried crab cake and white truffle oil.  The salmon dish was fantastic and each component builds on top of the flavor of the last.  The whole dish comes together in a single bite.  The soup was super refreshing and paired perfectly with the crab cake.  I could have done without the drizzle of truffle oil in this case, but it did add a rich dimension to the soup.\n\nOur main courses included the cassoulet de toulouse and oven roasted wild atlantic salmon.  The cassoulet was served with canellini beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, and garlic and toulouse sausage, while the salmon came with a fondue provencale, fennel confit, parsley oil, and roasted bell pepper sauce.  The cassoulet was rich and the sausage was delicious, and the meat fell right off the bone of the duck leg.  It might have been a tad over-seasoned but the dish was otherwise executed very well.  The salmon was cooked to medium-rare, something I didn't know was possible.  I loved it, and that's how I'm going to cook mine from now on.  It was perfectly seasoned and light, tender, and amazing.  The components combined to make the perfect summery bite.\n\nFor dessert we shared the nuage de noix and baked alaska.  I really liked both desserts with the nuage de noix being filled with roasted pistachios, almonds, and hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly and italian meringue in an orange soup.  I happen to love nuts and this combination really hit the spot.  I felt like I was eating the world's most special oatmeal cookie.

Just tasty, tasty soup.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\nI got: the salt cod brandade: HOLY SALT BALLS! A *very* salty (and oily) emulsion of fish, mashed potatoes, and oil in a cute, Le Creuset mini casserole dish.\n\nShe got: the trio of salmon: a refreshing, delicious dish with (1) Gravlax (raw salmon) wrapped around (2) salmon tartare, and (3) caviar with creme fraiche, herbs, and a lemon dressing. Delicious. \n\nShe also got: the foie gras. I'm not a huge foie gras person, but she said it was \"pretty good, pretty good.\" In other words, nothing to write home about.\n\nENTREES:\nI got: the salmon dish that came with some cooked tomato, corn, green beans, and, um, chips. Yep, chips. Sounds silly, but they were SO good and went well with each bite. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?userid=cqf8dqO5_QUxjfo6WiM7yg#QTD508A9mSCZUFbyjdbE8Q)\n\nShe got: the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, with parsnip pur\u00e9e, shaved Brussels sprouts, and an apple-calvados sauce. I'm not a pork kinda gal, but this dish was DUH-LISH.

It was sitting in a pool of orange cream and slivered oranges. Interesting and tasty, but not as good as what she got. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?userid=cqf8dqO5_QUxjfo6WiM7yg#PF9cDjDtOhJ9faAFKx2c2w)\n\nShe got: the profiteroles, pastry puffs split in two and filled with vanilla ice cream, and DOUSED with melted milk chocolate. There were these surprise bites of candied slivered almonds that were excellent. The entire dish was heavenly.

The warm, personal atmosphere is lively (a little noisy, but friendly) and I like how the service has a personal touch.\n\nFor starters we had the trio of salmon (gravlax, tartar and salmon caviar with egg mimosa, creme fraiche) and the mesclun salad. I loved the salmon trio; the caviar added a nice bit of salty bite to the refreshing taste of the gravlax, and with the fried capers (my favorite touch) and creme fraiche the salmon was especially delicious.

Okay, less whining more Yelping...]\n\nFor me, the favors of the desserts we shared were most memorable. The Nuage de Noix Pretty much blew my mind. It was so sweet, yet refreshing with a nice variety of textures. The experience was so great and new for me that there was zero guilt in eating it (which is how a great dessert should work, IMO)! The French toast was great too, with a hazelnut ice cream that softly melted into a tender French toast. It was a bit sweet for me towards the end but that's because the serving size was pretty generous and I refused to leave any bites behind. I tell you this though, because I think it'd be a shame to have two French toasts at the same table - definitely try as many desserts as you can as I am positive they'd all be amazing.\n\nGo out and treat yourself to a nice dinner at Chapeau!

My brother got the corn soup. It was very creamy and had a ton of corn flavor. Both of the appetizers were exceptional.\n\nI got the filet mignon for my entree.

Overall, it was a great experience. The food was near superlative, the scene was bustling, and the atmosphere was intimate yet casual. The only note that did not quite keep up was the service, which strived for the same greatness, but missed on a number of levels.\n\nWe enjoyed Chapeau! during Dine About Town, which featured a 3-course prix fixe menu for $34.95 - a truly great deal for food of this caliber. Even if you strayed from this menu and stuck to the regular offering (which my husband did), it was only a mere few dollars more. I began with an excellent Mesclun salad with grapes, pistachios, fried camembert and walnut bread. The combination of flavors here was just right - and the walnut bread was the perfect complement. Then I moved on to the bacon wrapped pork loin. Sure, it would probably be difficult for this dish not to taste good - but it was especially so. I finished with a Nuage de Noix, which consisted of roasted pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly and Italian meringue. Yeah, I didn't know what it was either when I ordered it, but I sure am glad I did.

Be aware that if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, I don't believe there is a spot in this restaurant for you. Tables are very closely packed.

But the waiter didn't have quite the right response either time. Then he delivered their dinner to us - that certainly didn't help matters. And somehow still in the end, it wasn't sorted out when we each received the others' bill. I overheard the table to my left complain about the slow pace of service - and indeed, it at times seemed to move like a snail. I certainly felt that way when my tea never arrived and I had to ask for it after my husband had gotten his coffee.

It literally melted in my mouth and the apples it was served with were crisp and sweet. A good balance\n\nThe Trio of Salmon was sort of bland. The fried capers had no flavor, the egg mimosa was too strong, and there was almost no salmon on the plate \n\nThe presentation was excellent\n\n\nThe Lavender Chicken with Dijon Honey glaze tasted like a flower bed. All I could taste was the Lavender. The portions were extremely small and had we not gone with the Menu 1 selection (appetizer and desert) it would have been thought of like a bar-snack, not an entree.\n\nCassoulet with the Duck Leg Confit, sausage, and shredded lamb shoulder was actually quite good, but rather simple. The skin on the duck leg was perfectly crisp, the canellini beans excellent, and the portions a bit better than the Lavendar Chicken. The presentation was extremely disappointing though. It was served in a round, brown ceramic baking dish, on a white plate. Everything on the plate was brown which reminded me of a poor experience at Applebees I had four or five years ago.\n\n\nDesert was amazing\n\nThe Nuage de Noix had a wonderfully sweet but strong lemon flavor. It was velvety in texture and the nuts provided a great balance\n\nThe Creme Brulee was hands down the best I've ever had. I'm not a huge dessert person usually but any time I see a Creme Brulee is on the menu I have to order it. It has a delectable crust, easily breakable and amazingly crisp/sweet. The filling was rich and light\n\n\nAn added bonus came when the Chef found out it was our birthdays and had a Caramel Creme Puff sent out. It was airy, cold, and a good way to end the dinner. \n\nWith our Dinner we had ordered a bottle of Malbec, and with dessert a glass of Muscat. Our bill came to $154 before tip.\n\n\nOne of the biggest disappoints for me was the fact that the menu posted online is only about 80% accurate. Many of the entrees and appetizers are different.

It was clear that the website had been neglected. \n\n\nConsidering I spent nearly $200 at the end of the night for average \"fancy\" food, in a loud environment..

IT was good to say the least. You may even dip your bread in to get the rest of the sauce. \n\nCOTE BOEUF: this was on the specials on the day we went and our waiter said it was good enough to share if we're not too hungry. In English terms, Cote Boeuf means Rib Steak which is a thick piece of rib steak with bone. The waiter wasn't joking when he said we could share this. He presented the whole rib steak to us pre-cut and it was very big in portion. Then he took it back in and cut it into pieces for us. The steak was very tender and juicy. The bone marrow was hot and deliciously gelatinous and fatty. Paired together was like a burst of heavenly flavors in my mouth. I really enjoyed it. I had about 5 pieces of perfectly cooked medium rare rib steak and it was more than enough.\n\nBASIL NAPOLEON: I'm not really a sweets person so I often skip dessert but the bf can be when he wants to. He was feeling dessert this particular night so we asked our waiter for a suggestion. He recommended their popular Basil Napoleon which he said was light and not too sweet so that i can try it also. The dessert was very pretty with fruits such as mango, strawberries, kiwi's, etc. It was lightly crisp as you take your first bite but met with a creamy texture once you sink your teeth in. Flavors were interesting and light indeed; my bf really liked it. But it was just alright for me. A bit too sour from the mango. but then again... i do have a biased opinion on desserts and mango lol. \n\nService was superb. Our waiter, Guillame (on the receipt), was really cordial and formal. Refilled our waters without request and checked in without being too hovering.

Omg omg omg.\n\nJk, of course I washed my hand. But this actually happened as he was explaining the significance behind the restaurant name, and I was very flattered. You don't see that kind of old school chivalry anymore.\n\nChapeau! is the quintessential French restaurant of San Francisco. I've heard wonderful things about the place since I was in high school and have no idea what took me so long to eat here. It wasn't until this year that I finally dined here with my boyfriend's family. $55 per person for 3 courses from their prix fixe menu, $65 for 4. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think there was an option to order dishes individually so don't say you weren't warned.\n\nThe complimentary cauliflower soup was a delightful opener to our meal. Simple, but very tasty. I ordered the escargots de bourgogne to start, which was wonderfully garlicky and delectably chewy. My bf's dad, a French cuisine enthusiast, ordered the sweetbreads-- a dish I've always been curious about because I've frequently seen it on tv and but have never really seen it on a menu. It was definitely interesting; to be honest, it tasted a lot like the Filipino delicacy balut lol. Not bad, though I think I'll stick to escargot; that's adventurous enough right? We also ordered some foie gras to share, which at most restaurants is my favorite part of the whole meal. This was no exception.\n\nFor my main course, I got the cassoulet de toulouse. REALLY filling. I can't even decide what my favorite part was-- the duck confit or the braised lamb shoulder. The sausage was good too. It's the perfect dish if you want to try a little of everything. Of course I forced my bf to get the filet mignon w/ bone marrow so I can pick off his plate. The bone marrow made each bite of steak melt in my mouth. Just delicious, buttery perfection.\n\nI ordered the nuage de noix for dessert, which I personally liked a lot more than the raved about basil napoleon. I really liked the contrasting textures of the nuts and meringue plus the hint of orange. The basil napoleon was kind of weird to the palette; you get that fruity bite with kiwi as the top note, then the pastry cream, and finally the lingering flavor of basil. Meh, felt like I was still eating an entree. However, of the desserts at our table, my favorite was the creme brulee. Classic.\n\nThe only downside of our meal was the wine that Mrs. Gardelle suggested, which was too young and acidic to truly enjoy with our meal. But they did give us complimentary dessert wine at the end.

Another pleasant surprise: we were still able to get the prix fixe, although it was past 6 pm.  Sure, it's $55 for three courses (or $65 for four), but it's still a much better deal and you can try more of the menu. \n\nEverything came out so fresh, some of my boyfriend's dishes were literally boiling as they were set down on the table. In hindsight, they could probably dial it back a bit on that score. He had the cassoulet, packed with protein: duck confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and generous chunks of sausage. I am a constant sucker for duck, truffle oil, and stone fruit paired with savory. The Canard aux Peches was ridiculously perfect for me. Though it was for an extra charge, I'm glad I got the seared foie gras to start. It was delightfully creamy and rich yet balanced by the light texture and pears.\n\nMy boyfriend was torn over almost every dessert, finally deciding on and thoroughly enjoying the Baked Alaska. The only middling point of the meal for me was my dessert, the Basil Napoleon. The feuille layers were limp, and I regretted being too adventurous with basil in a dessert.\n\nFrom start to even moments before we got up to leave, our server was attentive. I was surprised he waited for me to come back to the table to taste my wine before pouring me a glass (I've only ever had this courtesy extended when buying a bottle), and that he folded our napkins every time we got up. The chef had been so gregarious in the beginning, we half expected him to say goodbye as we left. No more than thirty seconds after we remarked upon this did we hear him coming out the door, following us to say goodbye!

Chapeau! definitely reminds me of homestyle French cooking w/ a unique San Francisco twist to it. \n\nAll 6 of us ordered from the prix fixe menu-- which was absolutely SUCH a deal (3 courses for $44.50) Wowzers! \n\nFor my appetizer, I chose the Trio of Salmon- which I thought was on the saltier side, but still delish nonetheless. The salmon tasted quite smokey and overall it reminded me of an Asian fusion inspired dish.\n\nFor the entree I chose the Canard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices. THIS, was the highlight of the meal.

However, the overall portions at this restaurant are HUGE, and I had to struggle to finish the last 4 pieces of this entree...but I did anyway, and felt like a champ! \n\nThe palate was great and I believe reminded me of cauliflower.

Anyway, it was good, but not spectacular. I tried my friend's profiteroles--and those, my fellow Yelpers, were AMAZING. I was swept up to cloud 9 by those profiteroles.

The place was pretty bustling towards the end of dinner and we could see why.  We were the second party to be seated, and I honestly would have preferred another table than the one we got, but I guess that's okay.  Because it was Restaurant Week, Chapeau didn't offer their Early Bird Dinner, which in actuality is a better value than the Restaurant Week menu.  Since foie gras was back I decided on doing the seared foie gras appetizer ($20) and for my entree the duck frisee salad ($16).  He stuck with the Restaurant Week menu and chose: the trio of salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and the Basil Napoleon.  \n\nFirst came out the amuse bouche which was a sort of anchovy breadstick, first bite, it was just a salty breadstick, then came in the fishy anchovy taste.  He was fine with it, for me, I just couldn't do another bite.  The foie gras mas magical!  He said it was the best foie gras he ever had - even compared to Gary Danko's and Au Cheval's foie gras scrambled eggs.  It was nicely seared and fatty.  The apple slices were the perfect sweet accompaniment.  The trio of salmon was so fresh and light.  Loved the tartare and the creme fraiche and herbs complimented this well.

The food was excellent. I have had seared duck breasts in numerous restaurants and finally at Chapeau! I found one that I truly love. It wasn't just the most tender or the most flavorful.

It was crispy yet buttery - a shocking contrast to the soft duck meat. I loved every bite of it. \n\nThe only thing I didn't enjoy as much was the escargot. It was on the salty side and the flavors were kinda monotonic. The trio of salmon was delicious but a bit ordinary. Mussels were excellent. The french fries really caught me off guard. Didn't expect they could actually pull this off so elegantly. Fries were perfectly done and the sauce is a very creative twist. Creme Brulee was the second best I have had.

Gentleman brownie points.  I was tempted to joke and say bonjourno monsieur but held back.\n\nThey served unlimited fresh sliced baguettes which was awesome. What was best was that we didn't have to ask the waiters for refill. They knew wassup and gave us another fresh basket right away.  We probably went through 5 baskets of those bad boys.

The Foie Gras was bomb diggity ding dongalicious.  It had a nice crisp on the outside topped with a pear glazed sauce.  Once you bite into it, it melted like butter.  That's a big statement coming from someone who usually doesn't like fatty meat.  The sliced apples gave a crisp contrast taste with the Foie Gras.\n\nThe onion soup had a great cheesy crunch on the top and right when you dive your spoon in, you enter a heaven full of melted cheese, crunchy bread bits, and onion soup.  Best part was that it wasn't overly salty like most onion soups.  One step closer to obesity? Perhaps.  Delicious?  Oh, you know it, baby.\n\nThe Trio of Salmon had a beautiful presentation.  The smoked salmon was light and complimented well with the dressing.  I actually really enjoyed the little fried capers sprinkled around, it gave a nice texture to everything.\n\nNow the only appetizer that was slightly disappointing was the crab cake with tomato bisque.

My dad got it done medium and it was so tender, juicy, moist. Any word that makes you want to reply with \"that's what she said.\"  I wasn't a big fan of lamb until I had this perfectly cooked meat. \n\nI had the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was juicy and tender.  Not as tender as that lamb though.  The mushrooms and potatoes went great with the sauce and meat.  Best filet mignon I've ever had? No. But definitely up there. \n\nBoth my mom and bro got the Salmon for a healthier option and after trying them meats, it sure tasted healthy! It came crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  It was served with this spinach puree sauce I wished had a little more flavor so I decided to stick to my meat. \n\nOnto Dessert! Finally! \n- French Toast with soft caramel and hazelnut ice cream\n- Tahitian vanilla creme brulee\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, rum-raisin ice cream, caramel sauce.\n- Basil Napoleon maui pineapple, manilla mango, banana, kiwi & strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream\n\nFrench toast. ::drool::  Just get it. It was heavenly.  It came out warm and soft with this amazing caramel sauce and went great with the ice cream.

I do wish the top was more crunchy, but it was light and not overly sweet.  \n\nHoly cow, did I need some milk for this Chocolate cake!  It was extremely rich and creamy.  Right when you pop that sucker out...warm chocolate oozes out so fast.

Very good. Nice texture, not too heavy. Tasting Fish Of The Day was the Scallop Risotto in Lobster Sauce. Impressive and delightful. Nice sear on the edges of the scallops were fantastic and made the dish that more memorable. Risotto was prepared and seasoned perfectly.

While the Feuille De Bric was a great compliment when eaten together.\n\nChapeau has set the bar high for French restaurants in San Francisco. To think they have only been around since 1996 is incredible for I thought Chapeau has been around for 30+ years. Chapeau will be around for many years to come. My overall experience at Chapeau was outstanding. From beginning to end the hostess, attentive wait staff, informative and well trained Francais serveurs, to the occasional visit from Chef Phillipe Gardelle to ensure all of our dining needs have been met, Chapeau is truly a fine dining French Bistro. \n\nP.S.- With rougly 20-25 tables reservations are encouraged. No valet so keep your head up when trying to find street parking. Don't get discouraged for it could take up to 15 minutes to find parking. Just a quick local tip.

I knew I had to go.\n\nWe made reservations about 2 weeks in advance and got the exact day/time that we wanted. I think making a reservation a week earlier should be sufficient but we went in around the holidays so they were pretty booked up for a Saturday. Also, they told us that they had an $18 corkage fee. That's a pretty good deal considering you can take in your  favorite bottle of wine and save some bucks, which we did.\n\nWe both went for the prixi fixe dinner options.The BF got the filet mignon w/ foie gras and I got the seared striped bass. I loved my entree but he didn't enjoy his as much. When he told our waiter that he wasn't exactly satisfied with his meal -- Philippe came out in no time to ask him why it was a miss and what he's going to do about it. It was really nice to see how much they truly care about their reputation and our satisfaction. As for me, I didn't really have any complaints. I love goat cheese and appreciated that there was plenty of it all over the menu. Naturally, the best part of our meal really was the dessert though. I had the French toast a la mode and my BF had the basil napoleon. Both were exceptional and really left an impression. \n\nOur time at Chapeau! was really memorable and we will definitely be back here. Even though I felt really guilty for eating a ton of fatty goat cheese, I did not feel guilty for spending my money here.

I was visiting an old friend, who decided that I should pick the restaurants since I can't eat in SF every night, so I did a lot of research online before making what turned out to be a fantastic choice.  We loved Chapeau!  Loved the food, the wine list, the ambiance, and the excellent service.\n\nI chose the prix fixe menu 2, a four-course meal, and every bite was delicious.  Presentations were gorgeous, a treat for the eyes.  The meal began with an amuse-bouche, an espresso cup of some magical tomato \"soup\" that tasted like the pure essence of a perfectly ripened tomato, with just a hint of heat.  I have no idea how this wonderful liquid was made, but as soon as I tasted it, I knew we had chosen the right restaurant. For my appetizer, I had the beautiful trio of salmon--gravlax, tartare, and caviar, garnished with microgreens, fried capers, and chopped egg and dressed with a light touch of creme fraiche. The salmon was fresh and cold and sumptuous, and the restrained garnishes added some crunch and interesting flavors to each bite.  The tasting fish was a perfectly cooked scallop served atop a fresh basil risotto that just sang--a lovely summer aria. My entree was a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with kale, parsnip puree, and a calvados sauce. The pork was tender and juicy, the parsnips were creamy, and the calvados sauce added depth to the whole dish, and what better to pair with pork than an apple brandy?  For dessert, the basil napoleon, which was fresh fruits with a citrus-champagne pastry cream layered between light-as-air feuilles--a light, tart, perfect ending to a wonderful meal.

Pretty good deal, eh?    \n\nAnd as for the food.  Did they deliver?  Here's a rundown of all the eats:\n\n+ Bread: warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. Slathered some butter on it, and it was super yummy!\n+ Pastry sticks with anchovies: Complimentary little bites, one for each of us. I suppose this was the amuse-bouche if I had to call it something, and a fun little beginning to the meal.\n+ Red beet soup: Wow, what a complex soup - so many flavors!  It pleased my senses!  The soup itself was pretty thick in consistency and hearty.  It was slightly tangy, partly savory, and partly creamy.  There was some kind of cream/cheese in the middle of the soup, which was visually pleasing too.  On a cold day, a warm, hearty soup like this was perfect.\n+ Smoked trout: This came with a side of greens, and I thought it was alright.  The trout was quite...smokey, and the anchovy that came along with it was super salty for my taste, but I did like the dish overall.\n+ Duck leg confit and duck breast: We ordered this medium rare, and it came on top of some pretty tasty polenta.  I didn't particularly love the breast pieces and found it somewhat lacking in flavor, but I did enjoy the duck leg.  While I wasn't wowed by it, it was still pretty good.\n+ Pork tenderloin: We ordered this medium rare, and although it came out medium, I really liked it.  There was also a bed of mashed potatoes, some greens, and pears too, which were fun to eat.  Overall, a tasty piece of meat!  I'd order this again! \n+ Basil napoleon: Like!  I was very surprised when this dish came out, as I was expecting a dessert that would look like a standard napoleon.  Instead, it was somewhat of a fruit salad with pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, mango, and banana, with four super thin slices of pastry.

Sweet, rich, and tasty.  \n\nFor $30/person (before tax/tip), I thought it was a great deal for stellar food.  Service was also good, our bread was constantly refilled, and our waiter was very friendly.\n\nAlso, when we got here around 5:30pm on a Thursday, the place was maybe half-filled, but as we got into our meal the restaurant filled up quickly.

Not the Vietnamese fish sauce but some sort that he made himself.  totally different so dont be confused.  It was ridiculous!  Scallop was a perfect sear.  Not over cooked or anything.  Pesto risotto was surprising and like everything else, technically perfect.  Flavor was amazing as well.  So creamy, I loved it.

We tried here on a whim with a call Saturday night looking for last-minute open seats (usually an impossible task). He offered to save two seats at the bar and once off the phone we cabbed right over. \n\nThe restaurant was small and signage not clear from the street due to a huge tree at the front sidewalk. But the warm yellow tones, glimpse of white tablecloth, dark orange droplights over the bar, and tons of happy faces clustered around tables and engaged in avid conversation made us sure we had found the right place. \n\nThe owner/chef Philippe Gardelle is amazing. I find it incredible that after 10+ years he still maintains an energy and charisma that continues to permeate this place and make it so enchanting. He makes a point to welcome every guest that arrives at the door, but still manages to have a hand on all the dishes and desserts and even the wine that appear on the menu. He walks through the dining room, ensuring everyone has everything they need, and he is extra sure to bid them goodbye and help them call a taxi if they need it before they leave. As things calm down towards the end of service he even wipes down the outside covers of every single menu and makes sure the pages are secured. \n\nOn top of that, the food is divine and affordable for French fare without the stuffiness. You can make your own 3-course dinner for $38 (a little extra if your entree is seafood), 4-courses for $46, with a sorbet between appetizer & entree at $50.50. Come as an early bird and order between 5-6pm (excludes Fri & Sat) and the 3-course is $28. There are also plenty of affordable good wines under $40. \n\nThe \"Trio of Salmon\" was absolutely luxurious with salmon tartar wrapped by a ring of salmon gravlax, surrounded by a circle of creme fraiche and salmon roe, again by an outer ring of crispy fried capers and fluffy little bits of soft-boiled egg, and topped with microgreens and a crispy thin latticed chip. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" that came only with the four-course selection was diced stewed tomato and sprouts atop a perfectly cooked scallop resting on basil-green risotto and a ring of creamy lobster sauce. It was like living \"Ratatouille\", where each individual component was a little spark of light in my mouth that exploded into fireworks when mixed together. \n\nThe \"bouillabaisse\" was a clean and rich-flavored broth with two fish fillets in the center and four mussels around it. Served with crisp croutons made of french bread and two little side bowls of smoky rich aioli, shredded cheese. The \"Cassoulet de Toulouse\" used dried and reconstituted cannellini beans which gave a great texture, duck leg confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and a little toulouse sausage. It was really rich and comforting for the cold winter night although a little too salty. \n\nThey offer two palate cleansers in the form of sorbet served in a little triangle bowl with a shot of liquor poured in. We tried the \"Colonel\", a lemon-ginger sorbet with a shot of citris vodka that really made the ginger sharpen up. Be careful if you've already committed to wine though because it can effect the taste. \n\nFinally, les desserts. Oh dear god those desserts. Our neighbors had a molten chocolate cake that for everywhere else seemed so passe, but this was a beautiful cake that completely collapsed in the center, looking like a chocolate donut with the most oozy divine chocolate syrup. We also eyed the Creme Brulee with envy. But we chose the \"Profiteroles\" thinking it would be a light end of the meal. Oh no, it's stuffed with ice cream, liberally drizzled with melted chocolate ganache and topped with slivered almonds. The surprising winner was also the \"Basil Napoleon\". Yes, basil and dessert. Who would've thought? The mini-diced mango, maui pineapple, banana and kiwi topped with three delicate cookie circles went so well with the champagne-citris pastry cream and basil. \n\nGot leftovers? They even wrap it up and shape the tinfoil like a basket. Adorable. Tired, stuffed beyond belief and content after such a wonderful night, we wandered home and slept like babies. \n\n5 stars, and definitely one of my new all-time SF favorites.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-02-09"}, {"excerpts": ["My dessert was light (Basil Napoleon).

I was very dissappointed in not only the presentation of the dish but the taste as well. The excessive amount of beans reminded me of Mexican food. I barely tasted the lamb or the duck, although the sausages were definitely there. I was expecting more from an upscale restaurant like Chapeau!.\n\nFilet Mignon with Foie Gras\nwith oyster and lobster mushrooms and potatoes\nThe waiter recommended us to get this with the foie gras and so we did. I think it was my first time trying foie gras. The waiter was right, the filet mignon tasted really good with the foie gras. I don't think I could have had the whole dish to myself because the foie gras itself is very rich, thus making the dish very rich.

It's not overwhelming with sweetness. It had natural sweetness from all the fruits. After having such a rich dessert like the french toast, it was perfect. Tasted nice amd healthy.

I thought the French onion soup was a tad sweet and the cheese melted throughout the soup instead of a large clump on top of the soup.

Hubby thought the outside of his rack of lamb was not seared enough and stated that he preferred the rack of lamb at Bursa Kebob in West Portal.  \n\nJr. Yelper #1 enjoyed the chopped roasted potatoes with mushroom more than his filet mignon.  Jr. Yelper #2 thought the duck breast was good as well as the polenta and poached pears.  I tried 3 scoops of the apple sorbet instead of their trio of blackberry, lime and passionfruit.  Both desserts were served with apple sauce and a lace cookie holding a dollop of applesauce.  The apple sorbet didn't have as much flavor as the sorbet trio.

The entire dish was superb, but the sauce was the winning element. Fortunately, they keep your bread basket full, so as to allow you to soak up any last trace elements of that sauce.\n\nThe entrees was where I took away a star. I ordered the halibut, and I was surprised by the presentation of it. While it was a great piece of fish, and good overall dish, the entire plate was beige. There wasn't a bit of color, aside from the red-ish sauce on the bread chip. A little addition of micro greens on the top would have given the plate more flair. Aside from that, it was just good. Not great, not memorable - and after the first two courses - a little disappointing. The fiance got the skate dish, which was better and had little bits of crouton for texture, but still not a memorable dish.\n\nFinally, the desserts were fantastic!

The oysters were incredibly fresh and well portioned, not like the dinky ones you hate to find. The trio of salmon was surprisingly very tasty, commencing with a nice tangy sweetness kick and ending with a salty aftertaste. This means a lot because I am generally not a big fan of caviar and salmon.

Being a huge carnivore myself, I found the meat cuts itself to be a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the sauce was fabulous, but the rack of lamb lacked the natural savory taste of lamb. Perhaps the saucing was too overwhelming and it stole the thunder of the natural taste of the lamb. boo.\n\nThe desserts were perhaps the highlight of the night!

Even if you strayed from this menu and stuck to the regular offering (which my husband did), it was only a mere few dollars more. I began with an excellent Mesclun salad with grapes, pistachios, fried camembert and walnut bread. The combination of flavors here was just right - and the walnut bread was the perfect complement. Then I moved on to the bacon wrapped pork loin. Sure, it would probably be difficult for this dish not to taste good - but it was especially so.

There is also a vegetarian 3 course prix fixe for $38. My friend and I chose the 4 course prix fixe with the palate cleansers. The baguette bread brought to our table was warm and not too hard, two qualities which I was very pleased with. On each table was a little square glass candy dish with heart-shaped corners and peaked sides filled with red and green jingle bells, the kind you might find on a jester's hat, a very nice touch. Our meal began with an amuse bouche of white truffled cream of cauliflour soup, very nice. Initially, i had planned to get the deep-fried black tiger prawns with shredded phylo dough, tomato & onion marmalade, petits legumes, and herbed aioli, $13 a la carte, but upon hearing about the foie gras appetizer special, $18 a la carte, $6 with the prix fixe, I ordered it instead. The foie gras ($19.50) arrived on a square plate, pan-seared lobes arranged on toasted brioche pedestals, the bottom of the plate covered with thin zigzagging lines of apple gastrique. In the center a thinly sliced apple wedge stood straight up; at the bottom corner a manicured pile of peppery greens that cut the richness of the other elements. Stunning plating for an equally blissful dish. My friend had the salade Landaise (a reference to the Landes region in Aquitaine) with frisee, duck confit & smoked duck magret (the breast meat of the Moulard duck, known for its superior quality), fingerling potato chips, and classic French vinaigrette (white wine vinegar, shallots, salt, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and olive oil), $12.50 a la carte. Quite good. Next came the tasting fish: pan-seared dayboat scallop with lobster sauce on pesto risotto with basil pollen and tomato confit. The scallop was quite good, and the risotto especially so, absolutely perfect actually. I loved every bite. Next came the palate cleansers. I had the Trou Normand (French for \"Norman Hole\"), a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the apetite and make room for the next course. In this case it appropriately came with a matching green apple sorbet. My friend had the Colonel: a lemon-ginger sorbet with a citrus-infused vodka. Sorbet Colonel is usually a lemon sorbet drizzled with vodka. They were both very nice. For my entree, I chose the sauteed striped bass with Yukon gold mashed potato, fondue provencale (tomatoes, court-bouillon, kalamata olives), caramelized pearl onions, jus de poulet (chicken), basil oil, and fried leeks, $24 a la carte. Chef Philippe Gardelle came around to check on the food, and was kind enough to explain the ingredients in the fondue provencale. Fondue here means \"blended\" as oppose to \"melted\" or \"molten\". An excellent dish. My friend had the bacon-wrapped natural pork tenderloin with polenta puree, braised green swiss chard, and apple-calvados sauce. An exceptional dish. For dessert, I had the Basil Napoleon, with Maui pineapple, manilla [sic] mango, banana, kiwi, strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream, and Feuille de Bric (literally brick sheets, thin sheets of wheat flour, the term bric being etymologically linked to phyllo...), $8.50 a la carte. This was a very deconstructed Napoleon, not in the traditional stack, but just as delicious and easier to eat! My friend had the warm chocolate cake with banana flambee, rum & banana ice cream, and caramel sauce, $8.50 a la carte. He loved it. On our way out, Chef Philippe Gardelle thanked us personally and shook our hands. Chapeau! is the best French bistro in San Francisco.

So we're thinking...this place must and will be amazing!  As fellow Yelpers have attested to, we anticipated a fine dining experience..especially with 881 reviews and 4  1/2 stars, what could go wrong right?  \n\nWell, we arrived and were seated instantly. My coat was checked and hung. Drinks (water and champagne), bread and butter were served right away. Great start. After sitting there for 10 minutes, this man, I'm not sure if he's the owner/manager/head waitress but he gave us the menus and took our order (He also took every table's order thereafter so I'm sure he's the top personnel) . We went with the early bird of $28/person and shared it family style.\n\nFOOD:\n1st Course: \n\nSOUP OF THE DAY (ONION SOUP)-\nTasted like melted cheddar cheese and precooked yet over cooked thick onion broth.  The bread at the bottom of the bowl was too soggy and had been sitting in the soup too long. \n\nTRADITIONAL ESCARGOT DE BOURGOGNE IN BUTTER-PARSLEY & GARLIC SAUCE-\nThe butter-parsley sauce was rich and could very well resemble olive oil.  The escargot was soft to the bite, excellent. \n\n2nd Course:\n\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS STEAMED WITH WHITE WINE, SHALLOT & PARSLEY, POMMES FRITES & ROUILLE-\nGood but not great following the escargot. The sauce was similar to the butter-parsley & garlic sauce used with the escargot only a little more diluted. Good portion.\n\nFARM RAISED CANADIAN SALMON BRAISED FENNEL & LEEK, BACON FLAVORED FINGERLING POTATOES, SHALLOT CONFIT, SAFFRON EMULSION-\nSalmon was medium rare as the guy that took our order had stated, but almost crusted on the top and tasted sweet. I'm a huge fan of salmon and sake but the sweet flavor just threw my taste buds off. \n\n3rd Course: \n\nBASIL NAPOLEON W/ MAUI PINEAPPLE, MANILLA MANGO, BANANA, KIWI & STRAWBERRIES/CHAMPAGNE-CITRUS PASTRY CREAM/ FEUILLE DE BRIQUE-\nDon't let the name and description fool you. It would have been a beautiful and excellent dish if it had not been for the basil flavored sauce. The basil is potent. If you get this dish, make sure you omit the sauce or get it on the side. Personally, this dish was so confusing; it'd be better served as an appetizer than dessert. It really made me wish I had chosen ice cream instead =/.\n\nTAHITIENNE VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRUL\u00c9E, ALMOND TUILE-\nThis made up for the Basil Napolean and reminded me why I was there in the first place...excellent. Great portion.\n\nAMBIENCE:\nObviously I missed the part where it says \"a French Bistro\" under their restaurant name. It's true, they're a bistro with a fine dining price tag. The place is dimly lit and the tables are very close to one another. Let's just say every time I looked up from my plate, I was practically a part of the neighboring parties' table! I had to avoid eye contact so they wouldn't think otherwise.  Also, be prepared for a loud dining experience as the place is small. It's pretty packed and everyone is talking too.  With that said, It's not a date friendly nor romantic place. And it definitely lacked the French ambiance I was looking for, the head personnel were Asian speaking French...which is great...but the atmosphere just wasn't there...and our bus boy/waiter was Latino who didn't understand English.  Just a really differently infused yet diverse place. Truth be told, I was expecting a place more like the quaint Italian restaurants off of Columbus Street in North Beach with Italian servers or fast paced Chinese waiters serving food in Chinatown. This place was just different.\n\nI always like to judge a place by its restroom...if you don't need to go, don't go. Chapeau's women's restroom (single) reeked of urine and d\u00e9cor sincerely lacked for such a high-end bistro.\n\nSTAFF/SERVICE: Very attentive, friendly, and fast. Considering we were seated by the kitchen and along the wall that paralleled the aisle to the kitchen, staff was rushing back and forth every other minute. That was distracting...but they never let my water glass go empty. \n\nPersonally, the 1-3 star yelpers for Chapeau give a more accurate account and perception. Everyone else might have been buzzed. *This place serves wine like no other...every table had wine and the staff is excellent at refilling if you purchased a bottle! Maybe that's what helped them through their dinner and rate the restaurant so high.\n\nWe walked out of there $95 less (gratuity included).", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-02-24"}, {"excerpts": ["For dessert I had the Basil Napoleon (a mixed fruit dish with pineapple, mango, kiwi, strawberries and banana topped with a light basil sauce) which also was a standout (I tried my friends creme brulee and was definitely more impressed by my dessert).

The red theme and line drawing of a woman holding a glass of red wine with a large chapeau tipped over her eyes is rather eye-catching. So I made a reservation and we came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The interior was cramped and the dim orange lighting made it feel like even more of a tight squeeze. However, it looked nice with flowers on the tables, white tablecloths, and a small bar.\nWe both went with the 3-course menu (currently $44.50), which was not a bad price considering it costs about $10 more than an entree. \n\nSeared Foie Gras:\nThe plate had a very nice sized slab of foie gras. The slab was accompanied with neatly arranged apple slices and some microgreens over a gastrique drizzled on the plate. The outer part was slightly over-seared and a little rubbery. It was still deliciously rich and fatty, while the sauce and the apple slices added sweetness and crunch to the dish.\n\nFrench Onion Soup:\nor Traditional Onion Soup as they call it, was good. Mr. Joy ordered this and I was surprised he liked it even after he ate all the cheese and was left with caramelized onions in broth.\n\nBouillabaisse - Striped Bass, Thai Snapper, Alaskan Halibut Cheeks, P.E.I. Mussels & Manila Clam, Poached in a Fish Fumet, Fondue Proven\u00e7ale, Croutons with Gruy\u00e8re & Rouille :\nGood, I just wish there was more of it. There were a few pieces of fish embedded in the soup, about 3 mussels and clams each. The fish broth was light, but savory. The 'crouton' was actually toasted bread with shredded gruyere. \n\nCanard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices - Duck Breast, Celery Root Puree, Honey & Spiced Duck Jus:\nDelicious duck breast went very well with the sauce. Maybe because I'm Asian, I just think it would be even better if the skin was broiled until crunchy. \n\nFrench Toast - Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Anglaise:\nDelicious take on French toast. The toast was so soft, almost a custard texture. Salted caramel ice cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. \n\nProfiteroles:\n3 profiteroles covered in thick chocolate sauce and almond slivers. These were okay, but the puff pastry was a little stale, possibly left in the fridge for a while. The chocolate sauce was cold. I've definitely had better profiteroles. \n\nThe prices aren't bad for French fare, but certainly getting up there. The food was pretty good. It would be nicer if there was a little more room to spread out. If I find myself back here again, I may try the filet mignon with bone marrow.

If you're looking for the French Laundry, why are you on Clement? Otherwise, you've found one of the best tiny little French restaurants in the entire Bay Area. Prices are very reasonable ($55 for three courses or $65 for four), and portions are excellent. Also, if I may gush a little, the bread is so wonderfully soft and flavorful on the inside, yet crusty on the exterior that we had about 2.5 baskets worth it.\n\nStarters - let's talk about how hot, well-seasoned (not overly greasy or salty), and perfectly composed their onion soup is. Not only does the bread inside hold its texture after the cooking process, the cheese stays in the perfect chemical state and doesn't just melt away or coagulate. Escargot? Classic. Definitely not for someone who shies away from garlic and oil, but the flavors coming off of this plate. C'est bien.\n\nMains - Although we didn't order the steak and bone marrow for two, the chef came out to personally slice it for other tables, and the smell coming off of this thing was ridiculous. Can I also say, perfectly cooked, rare steak? We had the bacon-wrapped tenderloin and bouillabaisse. Again, perfectly cooked all around. No briny flavors coming off tender mussels and clams. A nice hunk of flaky fish at the bottom, and a very decently braised scallop on top. The tenderloin comes with this creamy mashed potato side that you will melt with when you put it in your mouth.\n\nDessert - WOW. Real creme brulee with vanilla bean inside the vanilla bean custard. Not overly burnt caramelized sugar at the top and just a creamy interior. The real show stopper is the french toast. Again, imagine a great piece of bread that's been covered in egg yolk and seared and then re-covered in hazelnut bechamel and salted caramel ice cream. Top that off with a grape and a candle because it was my birthday.\n\nHow does the night end? Same way it begins. The chef says, \"Au revoir. A bientot!\" and gives us a handshake and goodbye kiss.

I remember dining here as a kid way back at their original location on 15th and Clement.  For the excellent food and value, there's very few like them.\n\nI have always liked Chef Philippe, he's very personable and even came out tonight to greet my GFs and I.  Shook each of our hands along w/ many other patrons and greeted everyone with a smile.  His food - excellent as always and if you have ever been to Chapeau!, then you would also know that his servings are very generous.\n\nWith that being said, it was no surprise that I had leftovers of my duck confit.  I literally had my whole duck leg left and when our server came to clear our plates, I asked him if I could box it up.  He literally looked at me with a \"are you kidding me\" look?  Shocking, I never experienced such rude service here before and plenty of people get boxes for their leftovers here, with their cute foil wrapping with a handle.  I didn't think what I was asking for was out of the ordinary.  I was still in disbelief and thought maybe he did not hear me clearly or understand me so I asked politely again if I could get a box.  The same \"what\" look...TWICE!!  I was sitting on the booth side and my GF who was sitting across from me totally saw his rude expression through the mirror behind me.  Not only was I full, but I was completely mortified at this point.  I am not a confrontational person and definitely did not want to make a scene, especially not over a box, but I also didn't want the food to go to waste.  Since I couldn't get a box that I had kindly asked for, it would have been shameful if I left a whole duck leg with TONS of meat wasted on my plate.  My GF sitting to my left told me to just take my time eating it, they are in no rush.  It was embarrassing to say the least.  I ate way more than I wanted/needed to and by then, our dining experience here was ruined.  \n\nBy the time our desserts came (which was fabulous, especially the French Toast), we were itching to leave.  It was such a shame!  My GF wanted to dine here one last time before she moves away, but I felt so bad she is leaving the city with such a bad impression of Chapeau!  \n\nI know good help is hard to find these days but Chef Philippe does not deserve waitstaff like the gentleman we encountered tonight to ruin his establishment that he has worked so hard maintaining.  My apologies for the low stars but given that they were featured on the Food Network's Mystery Diners back in 2014, Chef Philippe should know that his front end staff is lacking while he is working so hard in the kitchen.  \n\nI wholeheartedly still recommend Chapeau! for their food.  $40 for their 3-course early bird special (5-6pm daily, except Fridays and Saturdays) is a total steal.

In retrospect, this was WAY more food than I ever wanted, but I'm glad we picked it if only for the delicious tasting fish. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the trio of salmon and salade landaise. The salmon was fresh, but I enjoyed the duck salad quite a bit more. The different versions of duck (smoked duck breast, duck confit, and duck liver pate) in the salad were all wonderfully flavored, and the frisee provided a good complement and palate cleanser for all the different tastes. The potato chips on top were a nice touch, too. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" ended up being a delectable scallop surrounded by a creamy pesto risotto. Probably the best part of the meal, to be honest -- highly recommend!  \n\nOur entrees were the skate wing and the cassoulet de toulouse. The skate wing was fresh and tender, but the flavors weren't as complex as I would've liked. The lamb shoulder in the cassoulet was to die for! Juicy with a great texture and hearty mix of flavors... I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it. \n\nBy the time we ordered our desserts, I felt like my stomach was going to explode. As a result, I only ate a few bites of my French toast with salted caramel ice cream, but the few bites I had were amaaaaaazing. The French toast was warm, fresh, and fluffy. The ice cream itself was dense and creamy (and maybe a little too sweet). We also ordered the trio of sorbet (lemon, blackberry, and mango). The sorbets tasted light and natural -- we liked the blackberry flavor the most. \n\nOur waiter was attentive, helpful, and very French. He helped us pick a Santenay pinot noir as a companion to our meal. The wine was flowery and not too heavy, with a flavor that easily permeated throughout the meal. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe about this restaurant is that they sat us VERY close to the next table. There was probably an inch of space between us. Our neighbors were also very loud (thanks to the level of noise in the room, you have to speak up to be heard across the table), which definitely detracted from my experience. Though the lighting is dark and the decor is romantically European, Chapeau! may not be the best location for a quiet, intimate dinner. \n\nI am a sucker for cute little perks like the glittery hat they place your bill in (chapeau means hat in French), and getting to meet the chef at the end of the meal.

IT WAS AMAZING. The bread was baked with a crunchy crust and super soft middle. With the butter, it paired up perfectly. For appetizer, I got the soup that had a crab cake (I can't rememeber what the name of it was). The soup was PERFECT. It was almost like a tomato cream soup, but was really light. I swear I could've eaten like, 5 bowls of that. Great flavor. One of my friends got the tasting of fish and it was mostly salmon, but was super fresh.\n\nFor entree, I got the filet mignon, medium rare. I was debating between that and the lamb shoulder, but my gut just went with good old beef. It was cooked perfectly; true medium rare. Just enough red juice was oozing, and the meat was tender. It came with diced potatoes and mushrooms, but those got pretty salty once it soaked in the sauce for too long. The filet mignon with the sauce was mouth-watering, on the other hand.

For the first course, 2 escargots, 1 salmon trio, and 1 roasted chestnut soup.  I would've liked to have a taste of the soup as I love roasted chestnut, but I barely even got a second to capture a pic of it before it was devoured so it must be good.  You can not go wrong with escargots which I love served the traditional way in herbed butter so you can dip your bread into the melted herb butter after you eat your escargots.  They were so good that even the kid in a neighboring table was tempted by his mom to try it and ended up eating not 1 but 3 of them.  Granted he had no clue what they really were, it was refreshing to see a child being open to trying new foods willingly.  Salmon trio was also a nice combo of the salted capers, egg, and salmon but could've used more chips to scoop up the yummy mixture.  \n\nEntrees consisted of 2 skate wings, 1 mussel, and 1 pork tenderloin.  The skate wing was very tender and melts in your mouth but I do like my fish with more texture which is more of a personal preference than a reflection of the chef.  I absolutely loved the mussel dish and would probably get that myself next time.  The wine sauce is so flavorful that I ended up probably consuming almost an entire basket of bread myself sopping up every bit of juicy goodness.  The person who got the pork tenderloin really enjoyed it but since I usually like my pork cooked more than medium, I personally did not try it.  \n\nDessert was 2 cr\u00e8me brulees which were a good sized cr\u00e8me brulee and 2 French toasts.  I am so glad that I read Yelpers raving about the French toast as it was so good I ate the whole thing myself without sharing a single bite.

Too much temptation especially since everything looks so good.  I love how Philippe comes by every table to shake hands making you feel like he is welcoming you into his own home for a decadent dinner party.

That's how all food should be served!\n\nBread Service\nVery generous baskets of white bread with delicious butter. \n\n3-course Early Bird Menu ($37 pp)\nCreamy Corn Soup\nTrio of Salmon\nBacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin\nCanard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices (suppl. $3)\nTahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nFrench Toast\n\nEverything tasted fairly mediocre. My two favorite dishes were the corn soup and bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin. The pork was tenderly delicious and the apple-calvados sauce it was served with was superb. I would go back for this alone! My main dish was the canard (duck breast); the flavors were Asian-inspired, the duck served in a honey and spiced duck jus, which I didn't like at all. For dessert, the cr\u00e8me brulee was way too sweet, so the powdered sugar was unnecessary. The french toast was slightly better, but the mushy texture of the toast with the salted caramel ice cream and hazelnut creme Anglaise wasn't very appealing.\n\nService\nOur server was friendly, but the pacing between dishes was morbidly slow. We waited over 20-minutes for our mains and over 10-minutes for dessert. Our entire meal took three hours, which is pretty ridiculous for three courses. I've done 12-courses in the same amount of time! Otherwise, service was lovely. On our way out, we were warmly given kisses on both cheeks and wished a wonderful evening. So French.\n\nI can't say I'm dying to come back, but the Early Bird menu really is a great deal to take advantage of (Sun-Thu, 5-6 pm) and you must try the pork tenderloin.\n\nMichelin: Bib Gourmand (2014)", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-09-12"}, {"excerpts": ["French toast with salted caramel ice cream (lightly toasted, and scrumptious)\n\n"], "author": "Patty O.", "review": "My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner and were very impressed.

Being my birthday, I went with the works: Menu 2 with the palate cleanser and the upgrade for the filet mignon and bone marrow.\n\nThe appetizers were a good start. I got the veal sweetbreads while she got the trio of salmon. The trio of salmon was a very well constructed dish, something that wouldn't be out of place at a place like Commis. It was light, fresh, vibrant, with lot of good flavor. The sweetbreads were on the other spectrum, but just as good. It's a much heartier dish, borderline an entree, and I was afraid I'd be too full for the rest of the meal afterward.\n\nThe tasting fish was amazing. It was a generously sized scallop on a small bed of risotto. The scallop was perfectly cooked and risotto was seasoned well with amazing flavor. If they tripled this plate and called it an entree, I would be very happy. She didn't get a tasting fish, but Chapeau was gracious enough to give her a set of cutlery and a small plate to join in the fun.\n\nThe main entree is where I felt Chapeau missed the mark. My filet was well cooked, but overly salty, as were the potatoes. You would think they'd taste a dish before sending it out. I much preferred her duck breast but the duck leg confit was touch dry.

Not sure if our palates were cleansed but the bread that they served while we waited for our appetiser was indeed heavenly with a hint of garlic, soft on the inside but crispy on the outside.

I was disappointed.. what?!?!?!?! yup, you heard me right. DISAPPOINTED!!! It was too salty and the sauce was too sweet for my liking.

We came here last night for my boyfriend's birthday. We had reservations at 8pm, but we came a little early and were able to be sat immediately which was great.\n\nI'll talk about the service first. After reading a good amount of reviews beforehand, we were delighted to know that the service here is awesome! However, I honestly didn't think the service we received was anything too great. Yes, right when we entered, we were greeted by the welcoming hostess and the chef which was awesome! But the rest of our time there consisted of: our server quickly taking down our order, people just dropping off our food without any clear details of what each course was, no water refills for about 20 minutes of my boyfriend's cup being completely empty, absolutely no check ups or asking us if we enjoyed the food/needed anything else, and a long time to receive our bill. Don't get me wrong, the staff was extremely friendly, but the service wasn't as great as we had read. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was delicious! We both decided to go with the Menu 2: your choice of appetizer, tasting fish, choice of entr\u00e9e, and choice of dessert. They first started us off with complimentary bread of course, which was good! (Partially because we were starving at that point already). It came with (onion?) soup which I really loved. \n\n** Appetizers! I got the foie gras and my boyfriend the trio of salmon. The foie gras was amazing!! Came with toasted brioche, slices of fresh apples, with a delicious Gew\u00fcrztraminer gelatin on the plate. It was actually my first time having foie gras, so I can't really compare it to anything. But it surely hit the spot. My boyfriend's salmon appetizer was good as well; I loved how citrus-y it was. \n\n** Tasting fish! It was a seared scallop with a pesto risotto and lobster sauce. Oh gosh... this was too amazing. I'm somewhat of a pesto freak, so I absolutely loved this course! Everything on this plate was so balanced and mouth-watering.\n\n** Entr\u00e9es! We both got the filet mignon, with extra $5 bone marrow, and extra $8 Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine. So amazing! Cooked to perfection, and was super juicy. Bone marrow was a little bit on the salty side, but still delicious. I forgot to also mention that the boyfriend and I both had a glass of wine, but sadly I can't remember the name. Our server chose for us because he said it pairs well with filet mignon and he was so right.\n\n** Desserts! I got the Baked Alaska and my boyfriend the French Toast. I fell in love with the baked alaska.. Rum spongecake, rich chocolate sauce, toasted almond slices, coffee ice cream, and meringue.. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it. My boyfriend's french toast was great as well. \n\nI did write down it was my boyfriend's birthday on opentable, but I guess they forgot.. So I had to remind our server and he rushed back to get a candle. Boo :/ \n\nOverall, we had a good experience. Decent service, delicious food.

I've never had legit French fine dining so Yelp was a very good friend to me. With an average of 4.5 stars and a total of 1736 reviews, Chapeau! definitely did not disappoint. D thought it was delicious and it was also a delicious cherry pop of the French cuisine for me. \n\nI made reservations for 8pm, but we got there around 730pm since we left early enough to leave plenty of time for parking. Right when we walked in, we were a bit confused as to what to do. When you walk in, it's like a super small \"lobby\" with curtains blocking your view of the dining area so if there is nobody standing in that little lobby waiting on customers, you might be ignored for a long time because no one can see you. So after a minute of being confused, I decided to just walk out of that area so the hostess would be able to see me. If anything, this would be my only complaint for Chapeau. I was scared that this little neglect would set the tone for the night, but thank God it didn't. After the hostess saw us, we were seated right away. \n\nChapeau is small, and with the dim lights, it's very intimate and romantic. The tables are pretty squished together and though the restaurant wasn't that crowded that night, D and I were seated right next to another couple. We were seated so close that it felt like we were just all seated together on one table. It was a bit awkward at first.....but the older couple was very friendly and super cute so it turned out to be a-okay. (I hope to be that cute with my significant other in the future hehe) \n\nAnyway, let's start on the food. D and I both ordered the 3 course meal which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. \n\nAppetizers:\n- I chose the oysters. It came with six oysters, special vinegar sauce with garlic, and lemon. Oh it was divine. The oysters were plump and just the perfect size and the sauce went soooo well with the oysters. \n- D chose the escargot. He loves escargot so I already knew beforehand that he would choose this. I'm glad it didn't disappoint my little birthday boy. At the end of dinner I asked him what was his favorite, and he choose the escargot. Everything was yummy, but this was how yummy the escargot was for him. \n\nEntree:\n- Filet mignon was mine! Hehe mmm! I love meat. I asked for it medium rare and it was indeed medium rare! It was tender and was served on a bed of potatoes and mushrooms. Everything about this dish was cooked to perfection. Honestly if you asked me to choose between the filet mignon itself or the potatoes and mushrooms, I wouldn't know which to choose..I guess it was just too perfect together. \n- D had the duck leg confit. Oh this was really good too! It came with some veggies...and something else but I don't really remember what it was. The duck was tender and soft. Once you bit into it, it pretty much just melted in your mouth. Oh gosh. Talk about orgasm in your mouth..\n\nDessert:\nWe decided on the creme brulee and french toast. Funny story to this. I was waiting for D to go to the bathroom throughout the whole dinner so I could ask our hostess to put a candle on his dessert. Time was flying by and he still didn't leave the table so this had to go down:\n\n \"Umm do you need to use the bathroom?\"\n\"No...\"\n\"Maybe you should go..\"\n\"What..why? Oh. Are you trying to tell them to put a candle on it..?\" -laughs-\n\"Hehe yes.\"\n\nSo he leaves to use the bathroom and after a minute or two trying to find the hostess, I get a text from D saying 'she's waiting for the bathroom LOL'\n\nOh dammit. Then while I tried to wave down a waiter, another waiter started walking out with our desserts. Fail boat.. I ended up asking if he could put a candle on it first and the older gentleman waiter was very happy to oblige to my request. It took a while for D to come out and even though it wouldn't take long for them to put a candle on it, the waiter actually waited for my boyfriend to return to surprise him with his candled creme brulee. I very very much appreciated this :) \n\nSo back to the desserts. OMG SO GOOD. The french toast takes 15 mins to make after ordering but omg omg omg, you have to get this. THE BEST DESSERT EVER. It comes with salted caramel ice cream and goodness, it was that out-of-this-world type of good. The creme brulee was also very yummy. Unlike usual creme brulee with the hard top, this one wasn't as hard. I liked it more this way. Made it seem more fresh and made-to-order. The inside was very creamy and not too sweet. Yums. \n\nWow. Long review, but Chapeau! deserves a full-detailed review. With two 3 course meals, one drink, and one glass of wine, it came out to be around 125$ not including tip.

I came in thinking that they were going to be gross but after one bite it blew my mind. I can't even describe the explosion of flavors from biting into one. The sauce they cook it in is also incredibly delicious. The duck salad was pretty great but not anything too amazing. \n\nEntrees: Skate Wing in brown butter and Cassoulet De Toulouse.\nI had the skate wing and it was fall off the bone soft. I originally had thought I was ordering some form of chicken (yeah idk I'm culinary challenged) but was pleasantly surprised to find out this was fish. I personally don't prefer fish but this skate wing was so soft, juicy, and flaky that it changed my mind. I will always be open to trying fish now. As for the Cassoulet De Toulouse, I personally thought it was kind of a glorified French chili but my friend enjoyed it tremendously and I will admit the sausage was delicious.\n\nDesserts: Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Baked Alaska\nWow.

The trumpet mushrooms add even more power to it.\nDuck Breast: This was my friends' favorite. The duck breast was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, with an excellent lightness to it. Would definitely order again.\nSkate Wing: SO GOOD. Fyi, a Skate is a type of ray so you're eating the meaty wing of it. The meat was soft like seafood would be but still had some texture to it. But mainly, the combined flavors of the skate, potatoes, capers, and sauce balanced so perfectly for such a unique and absolutely delicious entree. I definitely had trouble sharing this plate with everyone..  :)\n\nFor desserts, we got the French Toast, Creme Brulee, Chocolate Cake, and Sorbet Trio.

Luckily they do their own menu that's only about $5 more! From other yelp reviews, I knew it was going to be good so the foodie in me was really excited to go, even if my reservation was at 10:00 pm.\n\nAs my friend and I stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted by the owner or chef (not sure which one) and he was super friendly! The waiters hit that perfect medium of constantly stopped by to make sure we were doing okay without being bothersome. Now onto the food:\n\nFirst course: \nMussels: HUGE portion for an appetizer! And the pesto toast it comes with is amazing. I recommend getting some pomme frites and dipping them into the sauce.\nDeep fried tiger prawns: Big prawns, good flavor. Not as big of a portion as the mussels.\n\nMy friend got the extra course which was scallops. Out of everything we ate, I would say this is the least memorable since I can't actually remember what it came with. I know it was good but nothing past that...\n\nSecond course:\nChicken Dondine: Menu says half a roasted chicken but it seemed small for half a chicken but definitely enough to fill you up (my friend had leftovers)\nFilet Mignon: In my opinion, the filet blew the chicken out of the water. The flavor was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. Even though I was full at this point, I wanted to keep eating it so that my mouth could always have that amazing taste.\n\nDessert:\nFrench toast: Takes longer to come out (~15 mins) but worth the wait. The french toast perfectly complements the ice cream\nHazelnut/Coffee special: As a hazelnut and coffee lover, this was my heaven. Not overly sweet but enough to fill my desire for something decadent at the end of the meal. My only complaint is that it was too small because I wanted to keep eating it! \n\nI love how the restaurant embraces its name and hands out the bills in hats. I especially like the special touch of putting your leftovers into a tin foil basket - so cute! The owner/chef made especially sure to personally say goodbye to us as we left - he even ended a phone call just to shake our hands!

We had reservations at 5:45 and arrived promptly and were seated accordingly by the hostess. Shortly after receiving our menus and perusing for a couple minutes, the waitress came over and explained everything to us because it was our first time. She was very patient and explicit with everything, mentioning surcharges and specialties and such. After strategizing and debating for another short while, we all decided on what we would have. \n\nFor myself, I had a 3 course meal with the Trio of Salmon, Caniard, and Baked Alaska. The salmon, along with every other dish came out beautifully presented. The salmon was delicious and prepared beautifully; the outer layer of salmon was especially delicious in my opinion. Next was my caniard, and it  was perfectly cooked. A little pink in the middle with the skin crispy. There was polenta with some veg on top which was nice and creamy. I cleaned off the entire plate without hesitation. My baked alaska was honestly nothing too extraordinary, but I have to defintely applaud the almond because the texture was so surprisingly crunchy! \n\nMy family also had 3 course meals which included: (apps) escargot, foie gras, oysters, (mains) bacon wrapped tenderloin, cassoulet, bouillabaisse, (desserts) creme brulee, hazelnut french toast, and the rum cake (: \n\nI don't wanna go too into detail on each because that would be a lot to write, but basically everything was delicious. The cassoulet, however, I do have to point out that it may be a little underwhelming. Huge disproportion of beans compared to meat. Given, our waitress diiiiid warn my brother that there'd be a lot of beans. It wasn't amazing but in any other setting, I would have thought it was a pretty solid casserole. Again, it is a casserole, we made that connection a little late hahaha My mom really enjoyed the bouillabaisse also!

My bouillebaisse's seafood and fish was excellent and cooked perfectly. Though I noticed my dad's scallop was much smaller than mine, about half the size only.

He even walked us out of the restaurant at the end of our meal, opened the door for us and gave us big kisses on the cheek. So adorable.\n\nThe food was tr\u00e8s bien! The sliced baguettes arrived warm and toasty with a rather large pot of rich creamy butter to spread to your heart's desire. We started with an Amuse Asparagus Soup with a light drizzle of olive oil, which was simple, flavorful and savory. The Trio of Salmon was texturally on point and extremely delicious to boot. The Tomato Soup with a Fried Prawn was fantastic as well. I've tried to make tomato soups to go along with my grilled cheese sammies, but they've always underwhelmed me. Chapeau!'s made me a believer in the generic tomato soup. \n\nThe Filet Mignon with Bone Marrow (2!) and potatoes was my favorite out of our 3 entrees. The combination of lean filet with buttery marrow is genius. My Mussels were fantastic as well and the fries came with 2 savory sauces - a rouille and an herby aioli. No complaints about the Seared Duck Breast either - unique seasoning and spicy jus. Yum!\n\nThe desserts...oh man. The French Toast is literally a slice of french toast.

Seating is intimate so you will be somewhat close to other people. \n\nMake reservations, especially for peak nights, but you can usually get a seat at the bar on off days like in the early to mid week for an early dinner.\n\nFavorites are the filet mignon, french toast dessert and the mussels.

Of course you still are limited to picking from the apps, entrees, and desserts per course...you can't just pick 4 entrees in case you were wondering haha.\n\nEverything was seriously D-Lish. The waiter first brought out a little taster \"compliments of the chef\", it was just a spoonful of a creamy pesto, fingerling potato and ham...but what a bite! It was one of my wife's favorites of the weekend haha.\n\nWe got into our appetizers soon after, I had the sweetbreads and she got the salmon carpaccio. I seriously loved the carpaccio, honestly one of the best sashimi/fish carpaccio appetizer type dishes I've had. It had a really light and buttery vinaigrette over the top of it all, with crunchy toasted hazelnuts, fried garlic chips and a few other herbs and spices and sprouts. It was seriously just good shiz between the contrasting textures and flavors. awesome! The sweetbreads were good too but it was just a little big and rich for an appetizer. I'd totally recommend it if you're down with sweetbreads.\n\nOur next dish was our tasting fish of the night which was a scallop on top of a pesto risotto. Another home run dish for chapeau, there's few scallop dishes that I would put above this one that I've personally had. The Risotto was of perfect consistency, not to creamy and to soupy, it was just perfect and the pesto went really well inside of it. The scallop was seared exactly right, and on the bottom of everything sat a brown butter sauce, that had a hint of sweetness to it to help pull it all together. Loved this dish immensely!\n\nfor the entree I got the filet and the wife got the pork tenderloin. I personally thought hers was really good but wouldn't have wanted to eat the whole thing. It was a tad on the sweet side for me, but to each their own because she loved it and thought it was better than my filet. Me on the other hand loved the filet and wanted more of it. Again it was topped with more french butter sauciness in a mushroom reduction. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was the melt in your mouth steak  that everybody writes about when they've had a good steak. \n\nWe ended the meal with the lava cake and the french toast...I'd go with the french toast any day of the week.

Chapeau! (got to add the \"!\") is by far one of the best dining experiences I've had at this point in my life. A few have referred to the restaurant as the \"Poor Man's French Laundry\", and since I think I'm going to be 'poor' for awhile, Chapeau! is a wonderful treat. My first dining experience here was with friends for the holidays and then with my boyfriend, for just a last-minute, we should do something special to celebrate meal (what we were celebrating, I can't even remember anymore). The have a great assortment of appetizers, my favorite being the salad with grapefruit (not currently available) and the foie gras. My favorite dish is hands down the tasting fish, which is more often than not the Scallop Risotto with Lobster Sauce. This was a great recommendation from my aesthetician, Ennee of Pink Cherry Spa. The dish only comes with one scallop, but it's huge, cooked to perfection and the sauce is so creamy! I usually hate risotto, but they make it just right here. Honestly, whatever I get as an entree is kind of an after thought and is usually finished off by my boyfriend. I haven't found an entree I'm completely taken by, but will keep trying them out until I do (so far I've had the sea bass and the duck breast). I'm really not sure why I always go for the 4 course prix fixe when I would be happy without the entree, but I guess it's not really dinner without the entree. By the time dessert comes around I'm stuffed, but the French Toast dessert is so good here, I always find that little bit of room to eat a bit more. \n\nService is spot on here -- for our holiday dinner, they informed us well in advance that our last minute reservation could only be accommodated at the very front of the restaurant, near the entrance, and it may be a little bit cramped. FYI - last minute here can sometimes mean 1-2 weeks in advance. This was fine, as we were just lucky to grab a table (indecisive friends made me late to make an rsvp) and the staff remained very attentive. Chef Phillipe is very friendly, so don't be shocked if he has a conversation with you while you're eating, gives you a peck on the cheek or shakes your hand. Servers do their best to be on top of things and will readily admit when something about your experience is under par. The last time I was there, dessert and our bill took long to get to us as the kitchen was backed up, so they provided us with a small sample of another dessert as we waited. So many other restaurants and their staff are not as quick to address their mistakes (I'm talking about you Radius, but I'll get to that in another review). \n\nThis is a great place to take a significant other for something special, as opposed to someone you are just getting to know. At least for me, the ambiance of this place may be a bit too much and the experience a bit too special to waste on someone you're not crazy about it. I also thought this was a wonderful place to take a small group of friends for a \"coming of age\" type of dinner, you know, where you all get to feel really fancy and a lot older than your high school days, order food you may not know how to pronounce, laugh about how you don't know how to pronounce it, all while enjoying delicious and elegant French cuisine.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-08-29"}, {"excerpts": ["We didn't have room for dessert, but have heard that The French Toast is to die for."], "author": "Miranda Y.", "review": "The owner is very nice and friendly - he pleasantly greeted us at the door with a handshake and hosted us as if we were family.

We had an 8:30pm reservation for a friend's birthday dinner and weren't seated until after 9pm.  We weren't alone.

When we arrived, we were greeted by none other than Executive Chef Philippe himself (although I did not know who he was at that time!). With a welcoming smile and handshake, he immediately escorted us to our table. After a server came to explain to us how the menu worked, we decided to order \"Menu 2,\" which was the 4-course menu.\n\n*FOOD*\nI ordered the French onion soup (appetizer), scallop with basil risotto (tasting fish), filet mignon (entree), and french toast w/ salted caramel ice cream (dessert). We also got complimentary dishes (which I will mention in the \"Service\" section below)! To start off, the soup was perfect!

The trio of salmon was delicious and a must-have if you like raw fish. The trio of sorbet was nothing special so I suggest choosing another dessert that's more worthwhile.\n\n*DECOR/AMBIANCE*\nThe restaurant itself is rather small and the decor is nothing spectacular, but if you want a place where you can have a quiet conversation with someone, this might not be the place. It was actually quite loud in the restaurant seeing how each table/group is only about a foot or two away from each other. We fortunately sat next to a very nice man who was dining alone and had a lovely conversation about the food with him. (= The couple who sat to our other side, however... they would not STOP MAKING OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. I tried so hard not to throw up my precious food that was happily sitting in my stomach. I've never seen anyone PDA to this extent at an upscale restaurant. Even the group next to them whispered among themselves about it. So as a side note to the couple who sat at the corner back table on 11/23: please get yourselves a room far, far away from here.\n\n*PRICE*\nA little over $50 for a high-quality 4-course meal? What more do you want?!\n\n*SERVICE*\nThe service here is what really shined the most on top of its excellent dishes. As I mentioned earlier, I initially didn't know that the man who escorted us to our table was in fact the main chef of the restaurant. That alone says a lot about the restaurant, when the main chef performs \"normal\" duties like other staff members. I finally realized who he was when he stopped by our table after we ordered to talk about his new \"fake\" foie gras creation, which he explained with such passion and charisma and in which he was very proud of! Surprisingly, after the convo, Philippe went into the kitchen and brought out complimentary faux foie gras for us to try (it was so smooth and tasty)! Another reason why I think the service here was excellent is because no matter how late you stay to finish your meal, you never feel rushed to leave nor do they forcefully try to make you leave. We arrived at 9pm and did not leave the restaurant until a bit after 11:30pm even though the restaurant officially closed at 10pm. While we were enjoying our desserts well after 10pm, Philippe came by our table once again to check up on us and then as he walked away from us, he shouted towards the kitchen something in French and a few minutes later, out came another dessert dish which were \"compliments from the chef\"! All of the other staff members were courteous and on-point when it came to refilling water, etc. (someone even came by to fold my napkin at the table when I went to the restroom). As we were about to leave the restaurant, Philippe stopped us at the bar area and cheerfully \"demanded\" that we give him hugs and kisses (first time I ever kissed a chef on the cheek! Oh, the French!). My only regret is that we didn't take a picture with him - he is so passionate about food and so down-to-earth, and his laugh is absolutely contagious! Thank you for everything, Philippe!\n\nThis is my new favorite French restaurant! I definitely will be coming back.

The Foie Gras was bomb diggity ding dongalicious.  It had a nice crisp on the outside topped with a pear glazed sauce.  Once you bite into it, it melted like butter.  That's a big statement coming from someone who usually doesn't like fatty meat.  The sliced apples gave a crisp contrast taste with the Foie Gras.\n\nThe onion soup had a great cheesy crunch on the top and right when you dive your spoon in, you enter a heaven full of melted cheese, crunchy bread bits, and onion soup.  Best part was that it wasn't overly salty like most onion soups.  One step closer to obesity? Perhaps.  Delicious?  Oh, you know it, baby.\n\nThe Trio of Salmon had a beautiful presentation.  The smoked salmon was light and complimented well with the dressing.  I actually really enjoyed the little fried capers sprinkled around, it gave a nice texture to everything.\n\nNow the only appetizer that was slightly disappointing was the crab cake with tomato bisque.  I like my crab cake extra crispy but the ball came a little soggy since it was placed in the tomato bisque.  However, the crab and the tomato bisque had a great consistency.  Dip the bread into the soup! \n\nMain Entr\u00e9e:\n- Rack of Lamb special served in a bed of au gratin\n- Filet Mignon with oyster mushrooms and stir-fried potatoes (additional $6)\n- Salmon with red bell peppers and sweet corn \n\nOut of these three entrees, the rack of lamb wins hands down.  My dad got it done medium and it was so tender, juicy, moist. Any word that makes you want to reply with \"that's what she said.\"  I wasn't a big fan of lamb until I had this perfectly cooked meat. \n\nI had the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was juicy and tender.  Not as tender as that lamb though.  The mushrooms and potatoes went great with the sauce and meat.  Best filet mignon I've ever had?

Right when you pop that sucker out...warm chocolate oozes out so fast.

Then came the fish tasting course which was a Seared scallop that evening.  My scallop was cooked nicely although the risotto was a bit salty.  I had the Striped bass & braised ox tail for entree & that was the most disappointing dish of the evening.

The cherry on top for this appetizer though, was the duck at the top. I love Peking duck, and I expected to chew right through this one but it instantly melted in my mouth causing instant palate gratification and sensory overload. This part alone made this appetizer worth it, eat it slowly. *\n\nEntree:\nCassoulet de Toulouse: In simpler English terms, the main course appeared to be breaded lamb swimming in a sea of canellini beans. Like the other meat in this restaurant, everything is so soft and my teeth literally cut through the lamb like butter. The beans were mixed in a sauce and made the meal filling. The garlic and toulouse sausage was OK, I've had juicier and softer sausage.\n\nDessert:\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake: Very hot, crispy chocolate cake that started 'bleeding' liquid chocolate once I cut into it. In the middle I found caramelized banana sorta like a hidden gem, props for the aesthetics of the meal. To the side was the creamiest vanilla ice-cream I have ever eaten, which made a cool compliment to the hot fudge.

Not to mention a pretty good value for gourmet French food ($38/pp for a 3 course pre-fixed meal) The  owner ensured that everyone enjoyed their dining experience and the food.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nAppetizer:\n- Lobster Bisque (delicious)\n- Seared Fois Gras with pears on the side (amazingly flavorful combo, beautiful presentation)\n\nEntr\u00e9e:\n- Swordfish, which was one of the specials (pretty good, but a bit fishy for my taste.  The bf did like it tho)\n- Filet Minon (very good.  I would love to try the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin on my next visit, as it has gotten very good reviews)\n\nDessert:\n- French toast (OMG! Heaven on a spoon!  Let's just say it's not the type you get at IHOP) it was French toast on top of coffee sauce, with hazelnut icecream to top\n- Chocolate molten cake (perfection! I am a chocolate lover and it did not fail to fulfill my cocoa craving) it was a fresh and warm chocolate cake with a sweet plantain banana and hot chocolate sauce in the middle\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this place for its hospitatlity, value, and ambiance.  Very romantic, delicious food and reasonably priced (you get what you pay for... gourmet).  Only \"con\" would be the parking (which is expected of Clement street, so arrive early)  But everytime we eat on Clement, we are always lucky and find parking within 10minutes of arrival.

However, Chapeau demystifies all these myths.  \n\n2 years later, I find myself back at Chapeau, this time at their new location; at the old Clementine.\n\nCame here last Thursday w/ reservations and it was PACKED! It seemed like a Saturday night. Although we were late for our reservations, we were promptly seated. \n\nAs we walked to our table, we were warmly greeted by the Executive Chef/Owner. Nice way to begin a good meal!\n\nFOOD:\n*Amuse Bouche of Cauliflower Soup: This was a perfect start to our meal esp when it was very cold out that night. The soup was creamy and smooth. Cauliflower can be very bland, but the soup was well seasoned to bring out the natural flavor of the cauliflower. \n\n*Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche/Micro Herbs with Lemon Dressing: MmMm! Essentially, it was fresh salmon tartar wrapped in smoked salmon and surrounded by salmon roe. The combination of flavors was amazing--Salmon roe: saltiness and zing, gravlax: smokiness, cr\u00e8me fraiche: creaminess, and tempura bits: crunch. Talk about flavor and texture explosions in your mouth.  \n\n*Bacon wrapped Veal Lion with Truffled Soft Polenta and Spinach: The veal was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Although we didn't see much bacon (perhaps it fell off), it did it's job by seasoning the veal just enough to bring out it's meaty flavor. The veal was very tender; the texture was pretty similar to what I would expect from a filet mignon but softer. I normally cringe when I hear of polenta, but my GAWD...the truffled polenta was TO DIE FOR. It was creamy, smooth, and rich. My how truffles can do wonders for a dish.\n\n*French Toast w/ Caramel Sauce and Hazelnut Vanilla Ice Cream: I'm normally not a dessert person, but I always like to order desserts when going out to a nice restaurant to see how well-rounded the place is. And, in this case the dessert is the reason why I didn't give Chapeau 5 Stars. It was toasted white bread (didn't taste the egg mixture) soaking in caramel sauce and topped w/ hazelnut vanilla ice cream. I was disappointed... the bread quickly got soggy from sitting in the caramel sauce and the ice cream. The caramel sauce was not what I expected it to be; it was very watery and milky. And, the ice cream had a very faint hazelnut taste. \n\nSERVICE: Impeccable. Our waiter who was the same waiter I has 2 years ago was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. He recommended a great California Pinot to go with our meal which was perfect. It wasn't too dry or too strong which complemented the meat well. Although we stayed there for over 3 hours and they were closing, they never rushed us.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: I actually prefer Chapeau's new location on Clement and 2nd. Upon entering in, there is a new bar area. And, the dining room is larger and the tables aren't so close together; MORE elbow room! It's very simple with hardwood floors, tan tables and chairs and crisp white table clothes. Because the place is always packed, it may be a little difficult to easily hold a conversation.\n\nCROWD: Older crowd with a handful of people in their 20s on dates. \n\nPRICES: I think Chapeau's prices are quite fair for French food. Both times, I did the menu 1 for $38 (which hasn't changed) and includes the app, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. If you opt for the foie gras, it's an additional $6, the veal or filet, an additional $6. \n\nI plan to come back very, very soon for the Prime Rib for 2 served carved table side with Bone Marrow!!! *DROOL*", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-09"}, {"excerpts": ["So we ordered that, trio of salmon, skate wing, duck confit, chocolate cake and french toast.

A simple \"I'm sorry for the wait\" or any information or some sort of apology would have been nice. Even when he dropped off the entrees, he didn't say a word. If you're in a nice establishment, you expect a certain level of service and we just didn't get it. \n\nOur entrees were cleared and while we were waiting for dessert, the chef came by.

Next, I had the scallop with risotto, which was disappointing because it was gritty and somewhat tasteless.  When I explained the grit to the waiter, he immediately went and told the chef, who explained that at certain times of the year, he doesn't like to wash scallops too heavily because they'll loose their flavor.  I appreciated the attention our server gave the matter, though I think not serving the dish would be a better decision on the chef's part.

Ultimately this poor service overshadowed the great food, so much so that I don't think I would ever return to eat here.\n\nThe appetizers we ordered were delicious, Goat Cheese Napoleon, and Escargot (A tasty pesto and just the right amount of butter made this some of the best Escargot I've ever had.) Our entrees were equally as good (Mussels with a glorious white whine sauce and a Scallop dish with thick perfectly cooked scallops in a bed of delicious pesto Risotto with a lobster sauce.)

The service from all employees was excellent and friendly from the moment we entered. Unfortunately the service from the server was not. Now let me preface my statements below about the poor service with some info about the fact that I am in no way one of those patrons that believes we should have a red carpet for our entry, be given constant attention every moment of the meal, and deserve endless groveling/praise/thanks for our patronage. All I ask for from a restaurant is decent service( friendly, attentive, appreciative/I'm glad you're eating here service.), and if the check is in the triple digits that's something I should without a doubt get. Now I was aware that the restaurant was very packed and the server was clearly busy, as well as possibly the only server there, but his basically rude/apathetic service was unacceptable. First we had merely an apathetic quick \"hello\" when being greeted by the server, a stark contrast from the \"Hello, how are you, enjoy your meal.\" from the hostess. His \"hello\" reminded me of something I'd get from some fast food joint teenager. Then we had to wait for far longer than we should have just to order drinks. When ordering our drinks the server gave a rude, almost mocking response when my wife ordered a glass of wine that was not available by the glass. Once our drinks were ordered we literally sat through the entire meal without being asked for another glass of wine/drink. We also waited what seemed like forever to order desert, to get our check and to return the check when we were ready to pay (I had to signal the server just to return the check, and was about to walk it over to him when he finally saw me signally for his attention.) Lastly once paying our check we didn't even get a decent thank you, or some friendly acknowledgement that out patronage was in any way appreciated. \n\nSo in conclusion I would recommend going here unless you are willing to forgive the frustrating garbage service, for the great food.

There was a type of green pesto oil with the bisque which I didn't find that appealing with the rest of the dish. 3 Stars\n\nHalibut- Came with a tomato based sauce that reminded me of spaghetti-o's.

It was an excellent, light salad with shredded duck mixed in, and topped with 2 other cuts of duck (one savory and one very tender). And with the early-bird, we selected the Mesclun Salad, a starkly contrasting hearty salad full of dark greens with a nice block of warm breaded camembert cheese.

For the early-bird entree, we chose the pan-seared duck.

Was there a way to order both? Sure, why not. However, I don't think I would have been able to stomach that many courses in one sitting. So, foie gras it was, and boy am I glad I stuck with my instincts. Probably one of THE BEST foie gras I've ever had in my life. A little bit of fattened goose liver, a bite of buttery brioche, and an apple slice smothered in caramel cider sauce all on the tip of my fork tasted like heaven. The soft creamy texture of the foie gras balanced well with the crisp apple slices and the sweetness from the sauce depleted the gaminess. I only wish there was a larger cube of brioche so that every bite consisted of the perfect amount of each ingredient on this dish. Highly recommended to anyone who dines here. If you want to venture out to something less organy and more Frenchy, the escargots in garlic butter are divine!\n\nFish taster of the day for our 4-course meal was a pan seared diver scallop atop a bed of pesto risotto swimming in lobster cream sauce. This was the perfect portion to keep us satisfied and craving more in between our appetizer and main course. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto was doused with plenty of flavor. I didn't mind the harder grains of rice in the risotto than what I'm used to, mainly because the creaminess of the lobster sauce was able to smooth it out. \n\nFor my main course, I was torn between the porcini crusted veal sweetbreads and the Maple Farms duck breast with duck leg confit. Since my dearest cousin has never tasted sweetbreads, I went with the alternative so she could have a try. The duck breast was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the skin coated with a sweet citrus glaze. The bok choy was a bit out of place for this dish, but the polenta was a great side. Although the duck was superb, the veal sweetbreads totally won me over. In my next visit, I definitely plan to conquer a plate of sweetbreads on my own.

The hazelnut ice cream was a delightful complement to the French toast, but pairing it with the rum raisin flavor from my cousin's chocolate cake was a better choice. \n\nThe best part about this meal was that every single dish came out of the kitchen piping hot.

This is probably not a big deal to normal people who don't plan their meals in detail days or weeks in advance, but was disappointing to me.\n\nWe started with an amuse bouche of cauliflower bisque, which was nice.  It had some truffle flavor to it.  I did Menu 2, the four courses.  For my appetizer, I had the white corn soup, which was served with a crabcake in the middle of it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#B1kv-rj9kdrjnoSGlMnYdg).   This was very good.  The soup was creamy and had a great corn flavor and the crabcake was excellent.   My fiance did the Early Bird menu and had an appetizer of smoked rainbow trout (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#eqgneuumnQxts9k3C1GC_g), which he really enjoyed.   The tasting fish was a single dayboat scallop served over pesto risotto and lobster bisque (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#isceefwoa_ccByoq_fWpkQ).   Based on Yelp this appears to be the tasting fish quite regularly.   This sounds amazing to me (its a combination of several of my food faves) but unfortunately was only ok, not nearly as good as it sounded.  The pesto \"risotto\" was basically just rice with pesto, not creamy at all, and the scallop was a little overcooked.  It was definitely not worth $9.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the Alaskan halibut (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#cSW86ppNBOiv8TXngWSKiw).  The fish was cooked well and had a good flavor, but I didn't love the surrounding sauces and accompaniments.    I did appreciate that it was not too salty, as lately I have been finding a lot of white fish in restaurants overly salted.  My fiance had a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#a147HoQ_3_-_KcYF5ZERSw), which he really enjoyed.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate cake, which is a molten lava cake with a \"banana flambe\" in the middle, accompanied by rum raisin ice cream and caramel sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#vOSgv9F4kauxkh17Pre5jQ).   (I'm not going to lie, the pictures of this cake on Yelp were about 2/3rds of the reason for our trip to this restaurant).   The cake was very good (dark, rich, not overly sweet) but did not blow me away quite as much as I expected it to.  It was a pretty standard, albeit quite good, molten lava cake.  My fiance had some kind of French toast dessert dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#JNQtRLJ82Jk2T0edgyQl0Q), which he liked.\n\nThe worst part of this restaurant is the ambiance.  The tables are crowded much too close together, which detracts from the otherwise upscale ambiance they are going for.   As a result of the tables being smushed togther, the blowhard at the table next to us put quite a damper on our meal.   The service was pretty good, but there was a long time between each course.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good meal, but not worth the 3-hour roundtrip drive into the city and probably not quite worth the price (at least for the regular prix fixe menus, the early bird is a very good deal).  My normal barometer for 4 stars is whether I would go back with my own money, and I'm not sure I would (even assuming I lived in the city and factoring out the distance factor).

I don't know what is wrong with us but we were not impressed at all with our entrees!   Everyone around us raved how good the sweetbreads and rabbit were to the chef.

Pretty good deal, eh?    \n\nAnd as for the food.  Did they deliver?  Here's a rundown of all the eats:\n\n+ Bread: warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. Slathered some butter on it, and it was super yummy!\n+ Pastry sticks with anchovies: Complimentary little bites, one for each of us. I suppose this was the amuse-bouche if I had to call it something, and a fun little beginning to the meal.\n+ Red beet soup: Wow, what a complex soup - so many flavors!  It pleased my senses!  The soup itself was pretty thick in consistency and hearty.  It was slightly tangy, partly savory, and partly creamy.  There was some kind of cream/cheese in the middle of the soup, which was visually pleasing too.  On a cold day, a warm, hearty soup like this was perfect.\n+ Smoked trout: This came with a side of greens, and I thought it was alright.  The trout was quite...smokey, and the anchovy that came along with it was super salty for my taste, but I did like the dish overall.\n+ Duck leg confit and duck breast: We ordered this medium rare, and it came on top of some pretty tasty polenta.  I didn't particularly love the breast pieces and found it somewhat lacking in flavor, but I did enjoy the duck leg.  While I wasn't wowed by it, it was still pretty good.\n+ Pork tenderloin: We ordered this medium rare, and although it came out medium, I really liked it.  There was also a bed of mashed potatoes, some greens, and pears too, which were fun to eat.  Overall, a tasty piece of meat!  I'd order this again! \n+ Basil napoleon: Like!  I was very surprised when this dish came out, as I was expecting a dessert that would look like a standard napoleon.  Instead, it was somewhat of a fruit salad with pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, mango, and banana, with four super thin slices of pastry.  The basil was an AMAZING touch - that basil flavor is genius and it's JUST what this dessert needed!  Not overly sweet at all, so light and refreshing, what a great end to a meal! \n+French toast: This was the other dessert we got; it was the polar opposite of the basil napoleon dessert but at the same time, I think this heavy dessert was a great contrast to the first dessert.  A very rich piece of toast, with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream and hazelnut sauce drizzled all over it.  Sweet, rich, and tasty.  \n\nFor $30/person (before tax/tip), I thought it was a great deal for stellar food.  Service was also good, our bread was constantly refilled, and our waiter was very friendly.\n\nAlso, when we got here around 5:30pm on a Thursday, the place was maybe half-filled, but as we got into our meal the restaurant filled up quickly.  With the dim lighting, cozy booths, and happy patrons with their food and wine, it felt like the perfect place to be on a wet and windy evening.

Let me start by saying that the service was amazing.  Not only from the server, but the chef personally comes out with some of the dishes himself.  When the heck was the last time you've seen that happen?!  Not only that, but he personally introduced himself to EVERYONE.  I mean EVERYONE.  When he first came over, one of us was not present at the table.  He remembered that and he actually came back 10 minutes later to welcome her to the restaurant.  Dude.\n\nwe all opted for the 4 course and i got the palate cleanser.  So glad I did.  Let me go over the food I remember:\n\nfoie gras with apple and microgreens with a carmel sauce:  I freaking love foie gras and this was no exception.  So amazing.  Perfect sear.  Only complaint was that I prefer it a bit thicker, but it was still so wonderful.  The apple of course pairs well (come on, anything sweet will pair with foie gras) and the microgreens are the trend now.\n\nTasting fish was scallop over pesto risotto with some sort of a fish sauce.  Not the Vietnamese fish sauce but some sort that he made himself.  totally different so dont be confused.  It was ridiculous!  Scallop was a perfect sear.  Not over cooked or anything.  Pesto risotto was surprising and like everything else, technically perfect.  Flavor was amazing as well.  So creamy, I loved it.  That sauce put everything together.\n\nduck confit with duck breast.  very traditional.  Duck breast was perfect.  classic orange pairing with it.  I felt the duck confit was a bit dry.  Somehow...  isn't it supposed to be baked in its oil?  Maybe it was because we had the last batch of the day...? I dunno.  It was still good.\n\nSkate wing.  first time I've had it, definitely won't be my last the way Chef Phillipe Gardelle cooked it.  So amazingly good.  So.  Good.\n\nPalate cleanser.  A must!  Vodka infused with lemon ginger.  The sorbet with it... dude.\n\nDessert... again, dude.  I was so freaking stuffed by the end.  there were 5 of us, we ordered 5 different ones, but since we were the last group of the day, they threw in a 6th dessert for us to try them all.  No complaints about any of them.  None.  We had the basil napoleon, french toast, chocolate cake, nodue de naiz (I totally have no idea how to spell it, it was some frozen creme type of thing), and a puff pastry dessert.

We ordered the 4-course prix fixe menu (appetizer, tasting fish, entree, dessert) and also added the palate cleansers (a pre-entree sorbet).  I would highly recommend getting the 4-course since it is a great deal AND the tasting fish is delicious (though you can skip the palate cleansers)!

Very creamy and flavorful.\n\n- Warm brie appetizer - 5/5: This made my night.  I have had warm brie appetizers before, but never anything like this.  It was the perfect balance of savory and sweet.  I was blown away and would absolutely order it again!\n\n- Nicoise salad - 5/5:  Unlike Nicoise salads I've had in the past, Chapeau used seared ahi, a quail egg, and very fresh ingredients.  This was one of the bf's fav dishes of the evening.\n\nTASTING FISH:\n- Scallop in a lobster bisque with risotto - 5/5:  This dish was heavenly and was the other standout dish of the evening.  The risotto was flavorful and the lobster bisque really tied everything together - absolutely perfect.  This is a MUST order if they have it on the menu.\n\n- Prince Edward Island Mussels - 4/5:  I don't generally like mussels, but these were quite tasty.  The accompanying fries were decent and served with a tasty seasoned mayo.\n\nPALATE CLEANSERS\nWe ordered both the trou normand (green apple sorbet) and the colonel (lemon-ginger sorbet).  I thought the trou normand was decent, though nothing I would ever crave or order again.  I disliked the colonel, but I hate ginger, so don't take my word for it.  \n\nENTREES \n(Note: Take my reviews regarding the entrees with a grain of salt, since we were far from hungry by the time they arrived.)\n\nBlack cod with beef cheeks - 3.5/5:  Decent, but nothing special.  The mashed potatoes were tasty.\n\nSkate wing - 2/5:  We didn't love the skate wing.  The texture was not what we were expecting, and it was kind of sour and salty.  There was little incentive to eat it since we were really full, so we skipped it after a few bites. \n\nDESSERTS\nCreme brulee - 4/5: Delicious.  It is not served warm, but the vanilla bean flavor is terrific.  This is one of the lighter desserts and a good choice if you are fairly full by the time dessert rolls around.\n\nFrench toast - 5/5: French toast for dessert?  Sign me up!  This is a bit on the heavier side, but I really enjoyed the caramel sauce and the hazelnut ice cream.  I would order this again.\n\nSERVICE\nImpeccable.  I accidentally made a reservation for the wrong night, but they still took us and gave us the perfect little corner table.

But unfortunately, the few things that were off, were significant.\n\nSo, in sum, for $150, we consumed a manic meal full of ups and downs.  While the \"flaw\" of averages gives this meal a 3 star rating, nothing is average about it.  \n\nMy lady's appetizer was the Salade Landaise with Frisee (fancy word for white colored field \"green?\" I guess it is a field white.  Duck Confit, Smoked duck magret (smoked duck sandwich meat slice), and fingerling potato chips, and french vinaigrette (not balsamic).\nIt was Excellent.  Crisp, fresh, immaculate, and a parcel of my Foie Gras appetizer was placed on top.  Nice touch.\n\nMy foie gras was pan seared, just a touch of crunch on the outside and all that yummy creaminess that foie gras should be on the inside.  Bravo.\n\nThe sweetbread (a.k.a. cow thymus, or other glands.  Neither sweet, nor bread! =P) was again a very solid dish.  My advice, don't get it if you get the foie gras.  Very similar creamy, rich animal organ texture that was already achieved better with the foie gras.  Also, the sauce on the sweetbread is the same as what is on the Filet Mignon.  Our waiter told us in hindsight.  Although excellent, I would have passed on the sweetbread, had I known.\n\nOur bi-polar meal turns for the worst when our two Filet Mignon entrees arrive.  While tender like a newborn, our medium rare medallions were pink on the inside, but BONE DRY.  Our jovial conversation begins to transform into various synonyms for SAW DUST.  The limited sauce on the plate didn't make up for the meat's sandiness.  I look over at a neighboring table's Filet Mignon: the gentleman's plate was just as arid.  Not a drop of juice, blood, sauce, anything, the filet was a sponge.\n\nWith 3 out of 3 steaks being dry, I was convinced that if I complained, nothing would change about the Filet Mignon.  I suspect (though I am not sure) that the meat was over-aged, leaving little blood inside to moisten the meat.\n\nTo quench the drought on my palette, the bordeaux wine I had was adequate.  But at $13 for a meager pour, I was hoping for better.\n\nThe desserts allow Chapeau! to redeem itself.  The thinly sliced french toast had the crust removed and is drizzled in a light, caramelly/mapley sauce that I can't quite identify, and the Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream on top was decadent.  The french toast barely had any egg yolk flavor and you could tell that a lot of care went into making this dessert.  \n\nMy chocolate cake (lava cake style) was very good, but Roy's has perfected that dish and Chapeau fell short of Roy.  But the Rum ice cream paired with it was something special; as rich as it could be, and as full of Rum flavor as ice cream can hold.\n\nLike everyone says, the chef is a wonderful host and kisses my significant other on the cheeks on her way out.\n\nAll in all, bi-polar gastronomy gets the belly full, and gives the emotional centers of our brains a roller coaster ride.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["he got the french toast and i got the cream puffs covered in chocolate...simply divine."], "author": "Georgia A.", "review": "The fiance and i planned a trip to sf for a weekend and like a good yelper, i did my homework before the travel to check out all the great places to eat.

It was a late dinner on a Saturday night, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with how our experience unfolded.\n\nWe were seated at our table and ended up waiting almost 20 minute before our waiter came to us.  He was very nice when he did come to talk to us throughout the night, but it was sporadic, he was definitely frazzled and rushed, and it just made us feel frazzled and rushed too.  He ran around the room frantically and it just made us anxious as well.\n\nWe did the 3 course meal.  I started with the duck salad and the boyfriend got the special appetizer of the day, seared scallops.  The duck salad and the scallops were actually pretty good and we had high hopes for the meal.  We then waited about 20 minutes after we finished our appetizer for our entree to come.  I ordered the duck breast (yes, I love duck) and the boyfriend had the cassoulet.  The duck breast was supposed to be medium rare.  The waiter made a big deal asking me if I would be ok with medium rare and I said \"that's perfect, that's how I like it.\"  My duck came out medium well.  When I tried to get his attention to tell him it was overcooked, he never looked at me, and by then I was hungry and tired so I just ate because I was getting tired of trying to get his attention.  The cassoulet wasn't that great either.  It seemed a bit dry.  The boyfriend and I have gone to a lot of french restaurants in various cities, and this was probably the less appetizing cassoluet we've had.  We were not impressed (insert picture of Mckayla Maroney not impressed).  We ended our meal with the french toast dessert.  By the end of the night it was one of the few desserts left and it was the only thing that seemed interesting.  Regretful.  The french toast was not good.  It tasted like a piece of french bread that was slightly grilled, dropped in caramel sauce and a hazlenut ice cream scoop on top.  The ice cream was icy too, I had chunks of ice in my ice cream.\n\nThe one thing I did appreciate about this place was the 1/2 glass of wine offer instead of the full glass of wine.

It was one crostini so naturally I wanted more!\n- Foie Gras: The portion was generous. It was served on brioche with slices of apples. I prefer mine with a some sort of fruit reduction so their version lacked sauce for me; however, the foie gras was rich and delicious as always. \n-Skate Wing: I chose to stray from my norm and ordered fish ....WOW! BEST FISH I've ever had hands down. It's served in a brown butter sauce but there was a slight lemon taste that complemented the fish perfectly. The flaky, tender fish sat on a bed little bread croutons and potatoes. My favorite green salad, mache , also accompanied it. Ive  never had mache warm before but it worked with the dish/sauce. Decent portion too, not the usual tiny French portions!\n-Cassoulet de Toulouse: My boyfriend also chose to be different and chose this over the Filet Mignon (you can also add bone marrow and foie gras!!) and boy was he disappointed. The Filet Mignon dish accompanied by the bone marrow looked overwhelmingly delicious and huge! Ok, back to his dish.  It tasted and appeared more German than French to me. It was basically a fried duck leg and sausage in a bean stew more or less. The mashed beans had shredded lamb in it. Each component of the dish was extremely flavorful; when eaten together, the dish was a bit salty. Interesting dish , just not to our taste.\n-Duck fat fries: Fries are my weakness especially thing crispy ones! These were fried to perfection and accompanied by an Entrecote and Chipotle aioli I believe (guessing). It came in a cone and there was definitely not enough in mine, it was very hard to share haha!\n- Rum cake Meringue : I let my boyfriend choose (trying to be nice) , I would have personally chose the French toast.  It was meringue atop coffee ice cream atop rum cake in a chocolate sauce. The best part was the ice cream inside.

The experience I had was definately worth throwing in my 2 cents.\n\nChapeau was my first fancy french resteraunt experience.

We got there around 5:30 , and the ambiance of the place struck me immediately.  Dim lights, a full bar, and a flurry of french accents attack you as you walk in.  The chef comes out and personally shakes the hand of every person who walks in (a very nice touch I must say).\n\nPrepare yourself for thick accents.  Luckily I speak french, so I didn't have to worry much.  I could see other people having trouble understanding the waiters though.  Yes, I did order in French, and no it didn't really get me any bonus points.  \n\nI started with the Fois Gras on a toasted Brioche, while the lady had a muscot salad.  Both were good, but the Fois Gras was seriously out of this world (well done yelpers!).  For the meal, I went with the ever so popular filet mignon topped with mushrooms and potatoes, while she had a flounder ontop of mashed potatoes. \n\nAs I told the waiter... the filet was just TOO GOOD.  Seriously.  I'm concerned that I won't be able to eat another steak without the texture aroma and deliciousness of this memory coming back to haunt me.  Medium rare and perfect beyond belief.   The Flounder was good, but not crazy, blow your mind good.  The flavors were alot more bland, and next time neither of us would order it.\n\nDessert was even better.  GET THE FRENCH TOAST.  Enough said... I don't know what they do to it, but it was the best dessert I've ever had, and I never eat dessert!  Some dessert wine to wash it down, and we were on our way.\n\n5 stars Chapeau!

I also tried the bf's salad with duck--possibly even better than the mesclun salad; but really, we're splitting hairs here.  \n\nFish Tasting Course: Next we were given a complimentary fish tasting course (reason to follow).  I had the prawn; and frankly, if a tiny shellfish were ever pure poetry, this one was a Shakespearean sonnet.  I can't even describe the utter perfection of these few bites.  The rest of the table had the scallop (which, since I'm allergic, I'm sad to say I didn't try).  \n\nEntree: I had the filet mignon entree--a perfectly cooked cut of red meat.

My brothers and sister came together to surprise our Dad for his birthday this year and I've always heard such great reviews about this place I couldn't resist!  \n\nWe were a group of 8 and had a nice table set up for us in the back.  It's a cozy restaurant. The tables and chairs are pretty close together.  The ambiance is nice, not too loud and not too dark.  \n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and brought two of our own as well.  Our server was very nice and made an effort to accommodate us as much as possible which I appreciated.  \n\nWe each ordered the prefixed menu option 1 and a couple of their specials as appetizers for the table. \n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nFoie Gras: Delicious!! The sauce was perfect and mixed with the sliced apples added a nice flavor and a better overall texture.  \n\nAhi Tuna Salad: very nice display, the ahi melted in your mouth\n\nMussels: The sauce was tasty!  It comes with this large pesto/garlic covered french bread crouton and they pair it with some pomme frites.  The server recommended that we dip/soak the fries in the muscle broth and my gosh that was a pair made in heaven!  \n\n\nSPECIALS:\nWe ordered a couple entree sized specials for the table - a scallop risotto.  For an entree size, it was still relatively small - it came with 4 scallops on top of a bed of creamy risotto.  Kind of reminded me of cream of mushroom sauce and rice - but of course much better than that :)\n\n\nENTREE:\nFilet Mignon - I had the filet mignon medium rare and a few others at the table ordered the same dish, except they added the bone marrow.  I'm not a fan of bone marrow so I can't give any kind of accurate description of that except that it looked cool, but I still wouldn't eat it.  The meat was perfect - very juicy, not too rare but exactly how a medium rare steak should be.  The filet itself is known to be the nicest cut of the meat, and this was no exception.  I can't even remember what it was paired with but who cares, if it didn't come with anything else I'd still order it.\n\nDESSERT:\nThis is the only reason why I had to take off one star.  When I made this reservation, I read a yelp review that mentioned their souffle and I thought, YES, finally Souffle!! My whole family LOVES LOVES souffle.. in fact, sometimes after eating out we contemplate going to Mortons just to order one of their souffles.  Let's face it - a souffle is not easy to get and not many restaurants have them because you need an on-site pastry chef.  A tip for all you souffle lovers out there: YOU NEED TO CALL AT LEAST 24 HRS PRIOR TO YOUR RESERVATION IF YOU WANT TO ORDER A SOUFFLE AT YOUR DINNER.  Contrary to the normal \"30 minutes advanced notice\" only applies to restaurants with an on-site pastry chef.  Actually, that was the first question I asked when we were seated - \"we're going to order souffle\".  I was seriously crushed when I was told the sad news.  I wish I had known that was an option!  I guess I just figured that an upscale FRENCH restaurant would serve souffle :(  Instead I ordered their chocolate lava cake which was a total mistake haha. Not a fan.. but nothing comes close to what I wanted.\n\nThe creme brulee was good, same taste as it should have - no complaints there.  My sister had the Baked Alaska but wasn't a huge fan.  The rest ordered the sorbet or the chocolate cake - but since I started the rumor that they had souffle the chocolate cake didn't stand a chance.  My mom on the other hand ordered their french toast.  Who would have thought something that sounded so simple could have such a unique and amazing taste!  Actually, her dessert came out after everyone else finished theirs for some reason, which didn't matter much to her because she was full, and so were we... but once we had a taste of that toast, we all chowed down like we hadn't had a meal in days.  \n\nThe chef also came out to shake everyone's hands and introduce himself which I thought was very nice of him to take the time to do that.  He must love what he does and it's nice that he came out to actually see everyone who was dining there.  Very nice touch.  \n\nI had to take down 1 star solely based on my disappointment on their dessert.  I would definitely come back again.

Both where full of fish flavor, alot of smoked fish flavor to be exact which turned out great.  Next I choose the Filet Mignon which was one of the best tasting Filet's I have ever tried.  It had this creamy sort of sauce,with plump mushrooms and little pieces of potato.  My date got the rabbit legs which unfortunately is the reason I had to minus a star.  The meat had way too much pepper on it, and it completely ruined her plate.  Maybe Phillip should have been the one doing the cooking instead??  Both deserts, the chocolate rum cake with ice cream and the French toast where a great way to end a beautiful experience.\n\nThe owner ends every night with kissing the woman on the cheek and shacking the man's hand.  He enthusiastic about this exact procedure that he had to chase a couple who missed his radar and made it out door.

We did not argue the point, which we should have, so some of the fault is our's, but I would expect at a good restaurant that it would be automatically done.\n\nAmbiance: It's VERY noisy inside due to the small space (we actually had to move the table so one of us could sit down). We could hear the entire conversation on both sides of us. We're not from SF or a large city, so this may be standard and maybe people from the city are so used to it that it doesn't bother them at all, but we had a hard time with it.\n\nStaff: Our waiter left a lot to be desired. We were uncomfortable on several occasions. There was just a big discrepancy between how we were treated and how some of the other tables were treated.\n\nFood: Delicious.  We had the black tiger prawn appetizer - 3 prawn wrapped in phylo dough (I think it was phylo dough) with tomato and onion was delicious. She had the filet mignon which was perfect.

I really appreciated that we weren't rushed!  The waiter gave us good guidance in our food/wine selections.  Normally waiters won't say what they really think, but my husband was thinking of ordering one thing, and he was like, \" No, you should really order this.\" (in a nice way, and I agreed, but I didn't want to be a shrew and tell the hubby what to order, so I was grateful for this!)\n\nI had the sweetbreads - and they were excellent.  They were creamy in the center, succulent and not overcooked (I had my fair share of overdone sweetbreads in Argentina).  The boy had the salmon trio.  I looked at other people's appetizers and it seemed like the two we chose were some of the best on the menu.   The only other thing that looked appealing to me was the warm brie.

For dinner, I opted for the prix-fixe menu, where you could select an appetizer, entree, and dessert for a pretty decent price.  For appetizer, I ordered the deep fried tiger prawns.  It was good and the batter was light and crispy.  My friend got the onion soup, which I tried and also thought was tasty. The cheese was nicely melted and gooey.  For my entree, I got the special that night, which was the pan seared scallops over risotto. This was good.  I enjoyed it.  Hubby got the duck and that was pretty good too.  My friend got the filet mignon and asked for it medium rare but unfortunately, it came out almost well done, so it was tough and chewy, without a lot of flavor.  Her husband got the pork tenderloin and it was a bit on the bland side, as well.  When the server came over to ask how our entrees were, my friend told him the filet was overcooked.  The server was very nice about it and apologized and offered to take it back, but since they already ate half of it, they didn't want to make a big fuss.  To make it up to us, they gave us 2 desserts on the house, in addition to the ones we already ordered.  That put our total to 7 desserts.  LOL.  It was definitely dessert overload.  I really enjoyed the napoleon, surprisingly.  I didn't think I would like it but I really enjoyed how fresh it was with the all the fruits.  It definitely wasn't like a traditional napoleon.

He made time to give us a back story of how he derived his Cassoulet, a wonderful home-style comfort dish he loved growing up in France.\n\nI find his Cassoulet quite hearty and inviting with its softer textural varieties from the Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder, Duck Leg Confit, and regional Sausages from Southern France. It's a heavy dish with a tad too much salt, but can be balanced out with good wine...\n\nI selected a modest 2006 Sup\u00e9rieur Senailhac I found rather luxurious being a bargain French Bordeaux, smooth mouthfeel and a nice fragrant blend with oak and dark fruit tasting notes.\n\nEscargots: a half dozen prepared in the classic Bourguignonne style. Some exertions needed upon mastication, good balance of salty and earthy.\n\nFourme D'Armbert Tart - Frisee Salad, Anjou Pear, Balsamic Reduction: a mountainous pile of Frisee gives a fresh crispness that compliments a heavier pan-fried savory tart batter, offset by the sweetness of the fruit. This was a very simple dish that demonstrated effective contrast.\n\nTrou Normand - Green Apple Sorbet, Calvados: I don't recall ever being served a dessert amuse bouche in between warm savory courses in any French dining, but I find the freezing tartness of the sorbet an effective disruption, giving tonight's dinner a multidimensional experience.\n\nWild Skate Wing in Brown Butter - Fingering Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache: A popular Southeastern French dish is this tricky fish which could taste rather off if improperly prepared.

The bacon added smoky layers of flavor and combined well with the creamy parsnip pur\u00e9e and shaved brussel sprouts.  Sauce was sweet and complemented the savory richness of the proteins.\n\nCourse 3: Profiteroles\nNotes: The profiteroles were fluffy, stuffed with vanilla ice cream, and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.

The red theme and line drawing of a woman holding a glass of red wine with a large chapeau tipped over her eyes is rather eye-catching. So I made a reservation and we came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The interior was cramped and the dim orange lighting made it feel like even more of a tight squeeze. However, it looked nice with flowers on the tables, white tablecloths, and a small bar.\nWe both went with the 3-course menu (currently $44.50), which was not a bad price considering it costs about $10 more than an entree. \n\nSeared Foie Gras:\nThe plate had a very nice sized slab of foie gras. The slab was accompanied with neatly arranged apple slices and some microgreens over a gastrique drizzled on the plate. The outer part was slightly over-seared and a little rubbery. It was still deliciously rich and fatty, while the sauce and the apple slices added sweetness and crunch to the dish.\n\nFrench Onion Soup:\nor Traditional Onion Soup as they call it, was good.

There were a few pieces of fish embedded in the soup, about 3 mussels and clams each. The fish broth was light, but savory. The 'crouton' was actually toasted bread with shredded gruyere. \n\nCanard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices - Duck Breast, Celery Root Puree, Honey & Spiced Duck Jus:\nDelicious duck breast went very well with the sauce. Maybe because I'm Asian, I just think it would be even better if the skin was broiled until crunchy. \n\nFrench Toast - Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Anglaise:\nDelicious take on French toast. The toast was so soft, almost a custard texture. Salted caramel ice cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. \n\nProfiteroles:\n3 profiteroles covered in thick chocolate sauce and almond slivers. These were okay, but the puff pastry was a little stale, possibly left in the fridge for a while. The chocolate sauce was cold. I've definitely had better profiteroles. \n\nThe prices aren't bad for French fare, but certainly getting up there. The food was pretty good.

Though overall I thought it was just okay. \n\nTo end we had all three vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, profiteroles, and nuage de noix. The cold orange sauce of the nuage was yummy, very crisp and refreshing but the pastry was too nutty for my taste. If you love almonds and other nuts you would probably love it, just not up my alley is all. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was really good. Probably one of the  top two best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've had. I really liked that it wasn't too sweet or heavy. The cream puffs was sooo good.

It was pretty yummy. \n\nMesclun Salad with Creme Dijonnaise, Red Seedless Grapes, Pistachio, and Fried Camembert - This salad was huge!!! The fried camembert (cheese) was very yummy!!! I really enjoyed this salad because it was different from the usual type I would eat. After I finished my salad, I was already full and this was just the beginning of my meal too!\n\nTraditional Escargots de Buorgogne - My mom had ordered this and when I tried one of them, they were so delicious!!! I was glad they were not in the shells. The escargots were baked in butter, parsley and garlic. Loved the flavors.\n\nTrio of Salmon - My dad had this and I got to take a bite of it. This had came with tartare and caviar. It was very refreshing and flavorful. Good portion amount. \n\nPrince Edward Island Mussels - I am a big fan of seafood so I had to get this. I love mussels! The mussels were steamed with white whine, shallot and parsley, which came along with a side of pommes frites. Yum! I had been already full from my salad, so I ate all the mussels and saved my fries for to go. The white wine sauce was soo yummy that I asked for more bread to dip and eat it. \n\nWild Caught Skate Wing - Never heard of this dish before, but my dad had this and it was a pretty big portion! I could tell that it was very soft and tender and very flavorful by the looks of it!\n\nBoneless Roasted Half Chicken Dodine Stuffed with Mousse of Veal - My mom had this and I remembered she was really full and had packed this to go! \n\nFrench Toast, Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Creme Anglaise - I was already so full from my main course, but I just had to save room for dessert. The french toast was so good! This was so fluffy! Plus, I loved that it came with the salted caramel ice cream. It melted in my mouth with each bite. \n\nProfiteroles - This was pretty good and sweet at the same time. Quite different from the typical kind of desserts. \n\nNuage de Noix - This had roasted pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts in a frozen Chantilly and Italian meringue, orange soup. A bit sweet, but still delicious.\n\nThroughout the night, service was excellent and they kept checking up on us to see how everything was.

I came here with a bunch of friends for SF Dine About Town at one of my girlfriend's suggestions since she loves French cuisine. I've always passed by this area on Clement but never noticed Chapeau! It has a cute exterior but is quite small and can be easy to miss.\n\nI had made the reservation for 7:30pm for 6 but last mine my friend's girlfriend decided to come along too. Unfortunately because this restaurant is pretty small and they were packed that night, we could not be moved to a larger table and had to accommodate 7 people at a table that was only sufficient for 6. It wasn't really the restaurants fault and both the hostess and our waiter were extremely attentive and accommodating, apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Dine About Town Menu was $34.95 for a three course pre-fixe meal. After taking a look at their regular menu, we all found it to be unnecessary. Chapeau offers their own pre-fixe menus for similar prices and your options are open to anything on the menu. It costs additional for certain items but well worth the cost.\n\nBetween the 7 of us, we sampled most of the entrees as well as a majority of the desserts. The food was delicious. I don't quiet remember every item we ordered but each entree was as delicious as it looked. I would definitely recommend the Salade Landaise as an appetizer. Pan Seared Foie Gras was the special for the day; this would be a good dish to share since it comes in a large heavy piece. Personally i prefer the rare preparation much more but this was quite tasty as well. It was an amusing highlight that braised lamb came with baby carrots and the filet mignon was quiet tender. For desserts... the Profiteroles is a MUST !! Out of the 5 desserts we shared, this one was the best.

Keep in mind, their Early Bird is actually $33 (an additional $3 if you order the duck) instead of the $28 I originally saw.  Even so, it was still a great deal.\n\nI made a reservation for Sunday at 5:15PM.  Then I thought I was going to be late as I was coming from the Giants game so I called to make it later which they changed for me.  Then we got there around 5:15 afterall and they were more than willing to seat us.  By 5:45 this place got filled up.\n\nBoth my boyfriend and I ordered from the Early Bird menu.\n\nI got the Escargot: really enjoyed it, but I love butter so that's to be expected. I noticed it was one of the most popular/ordered dish as well.  \n\nMy boyfriend got the Trio of Salmon.  Both enjoyed it as well.\n\nFor our entrees I was going to get the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin but the waiter recommended the white skate wing and it was a great recommendation.  The skate tasted so tender.  it was not to heavy but I was full off the meal.  My boyfriend got the duck which we enjoyed but wished there was a bit more fat on the duck.  It was a bit too lean for both our tastes.\n\nFor dessert my bf snatched the French Toast, Soft Caramel, Hazelnut Ice Cream and as the waiter said, it is the best dessert on the menu.  It was sooooooo gooooood.  The soft, delicious, warm french toast with the perfect ice cream. awmygawd.  \n\nWanting to try something different I took the waiter's second recommendation which I think was the Profiteroles.  Four pastries stuffed with icecream served with more icecream.  It was good...but the french toast totally won that.  If we ever returned, we both agreed we'd just order two french toast dishes.\n\nThe venue isn't particularly fancy.  It was a pretty loud environment and the decor didn't shout bougie.  It was a fairly laid back comfortable setting.  And the main cook came out to talk to some diners and was at the door when we left and thanked us.

A *very* salty (and oily) emulsion of fish, mashed potatoes, and oil in a cute, Le Creuset mini casserole dish.\n\nShe got: the trio of salmon: a refreshing, delicious dish with (1) Gravlax (raw salmon) wrapped around (2) salmon tartare, and (3) caviar with creme fraiche, herbs, and a lemon dressing. Delicious. \n\nShe also got: the foie gras. I'm not a huge foie gras person, but she said it was \"pretty good, pretty good.\" In other words, nothing to write home about.\n\nENTREES:\nI got: the salmon dish that came with some cooked tomato, corn, green beans, and, um, chips. Yep, chips. Sounds silly, but they were SO good and went well with each bite.

I had ordered the creme brulee and loved how it wasn't overly sweet and had lots of the carmelized sugar on top. The chef had sent us two more desserts: the lemon tart & the profiteroles. I really enjoyed the profiteroles as they were basically creme puffs but they were not extremely rich as they were also covered in melted dark chocolate. To me, the lemon tart was extremely sour but it could have also been since I had already taken bites from the creme brulee. Both my co-workers enjoyed it though.\n\nThe waiter was very patient with us as we tried to settle the number of people in our group since many canceled on us.

She got the Trio of salmon which had lox, tartar, & roe.  It looked really pretty & she & my dad finished the plate in a flash.  For entree she had the Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin which looked still raw in the middle but I am sure the kitchen wouldn't let it out if it wasn't safe to eat.  Besides, it's been a few days and she isn't dying of cystercercosis.  The puree @ on the plate was really sweet & we think it might be banana.  Unfortunately this item is not on the menu online so I can't go back and verify our suspicion.  She finished off with Profiteroles which were nice but they were no match to the ones I had @ Delfina (read my review).  The chocolate sauce was quite sour & overwhelmed the flavor of the vanilla ice cream so it was just cold.\n\nI created my own 4 course dinner starting with the Traditional escargot de Bourgogne.  I haven't had escargots since I was 10 so this was a treat.  They were really meaty & super delicious.  I do wish they were still in their shells though.  Then came the fish tasting course which was a Seared scallop that evening.  My scallop was cooked nicely although the risotto was a bit salty.  I had the Striped bass & braised ox tail for entree & that was the most disappointing dish of the evening.  The filets were a bit fishy, there was this 1 tiny bite of ox tail hidden in the dish, & the sauce was strangely sour in a way that my palette is not accustomed to.  The best thing about the dish was the mashed potato which was really rich, creamy, & buttery good.  I ended with a French toast which I adored.  I am not sure what kind of bread was used but its density was able to soak up all the hazelnut sauce goodness.  The salted caramel ice cream was in sanely good.\n\nMy Daddy (can't call him a birthday boy & birthday man sounds weird) also created his 4 course dinner.  He started with the Porcini crusted veal sweetbread.  This was our first time have sweetbreads & we really liked how creamy they were.  He also had the Scallop tasting course that I did and he actually had sand in his scallop.  He had the Cassoulet de Toulouse for the main course which he found to be too salty (he has hypertension so he doesn't eat a lot of salt).  He really liked the Cannellini bean with the shredded lamb shoulder though.  He finished his meal with his favorite dessert, a Tahitienne vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It had a really nice crust on top, it wasn't too sweet, & it was creamy without being too rich.\n\nThe service was good except for the main waiter who gave off a \"I don't really want to be here serving you\" attitude.  The man who I assume to be the chef/owner shook our hands when we arrived & gave my mom & I kisses on the cheek when we were leaving...that led to some awkward but funny moments.

We visited the restaurant nearly every time we were in the city and it got better and better with each visit.  Until it changed hands, or merged, or whatever it did when it took on the new name-- Chapeau! \n\nWe first visited \"Chapeau\" shortly after it changed hands.  And we noticed just a hint of decline -- the sauces a little too salty --the stupid straw hat when we got our bill -- nothing major, still a great place.  But we visited this Thursday evening and I left our favorite little Bistro almost in tears.  \n\nI knew something was off the minute we sat down.  It was cold in the restaurant and the woman who seated us was dressed in a winter coat and barefoot wearing slides (these are basically flip flops with heels).  Where was the chef?  Where were the French waiters? Where was the pride and professionalism? There were no fresh flowers at the bar or anywhere, (save some pathetic nearly dead daisies  stuffed into a little 3 inch can you'd get from the Dollar Store on the tables)  and nothing on the walls. \n\nThen the appetizers arrived.  My salmon trio was pounded with a meat mallet and not in a good way.  The Roe served with it smelled and tasted fishy, as in not fresh.\nMy Husband's sweetbreads were chewy and gross (his words). \n\nEntrees were equally disappointing.  My Husband and I both ordered the lamb.  I've heard others say this is the best thing on the menu.  Oh my.  Maybe Thursday night is the real chef's night off-- but our lamb, while generous (too much so) in portion was dry and dare I say, PREsliced.  As in maybe made far ahead of time, sliced, and then warmed before serving -- completely devoid now of both juices and flavor.  I would have preferred half a portion of Clementine's lamb to the double portion of Chapeau's.  (NOTE TO OWNER:  you cannot make up for quality by increasing portions)\n\nBut the worst part, the part where I knew the affair was over, the potato gratin.  Formerly this was a square of carefully prepared wonderfulness - thinly sliced potatoes with just the right balance of Gruyere and cream -- oh the memories.  What we got was a sloppy ramekin of diced potatoes with cheddar melted on top -- a greasy pile of yuk that one might be served at Applebees.  \n\nI was frankly too upset to enjoy dessert.  But the \"Fixe\" was in, so what could we do?\n\nAgain, I got the feeling food was imported from somewhere else,  passed off as something they created.  The apple tart was barely warm and the bottom crust soggy. (A sure sign of thawing).   The Profiteroles also tasted thawed and I think  were doused with Hershey's syrup.  If it wasnt, it tasted like it.  So sad.\n\nI am accustomed to this type of \"pretender\" restaurant in my hometown.  Which is why I  look forward to a trip to the city for something better.   This will sound snobby, but as you can see by the many five stars Chapeau continues to receive, 95% of diners either cannot tell the difference, or don't really care (I don't know which is worse).\n\nSo they sold out. I get it.  Why do the work if practically no one notices? But It really hurt to see one that strove to be the very best, sink to the level of mediocre pretender.    \n\nChapeau has no !.

Bone marrow wasn't worth the additional cost as the paticular bone we got didn't have much marrow at all. 3 stars\n\nDessert-\nBasil Napolean-cute little dessert with fruits in a basket and a dallop of champagne whipped cream.  We were mainly curious about the champagne cream. It was light and was the perfect ending to a heavy meal. 5 stars.\n\nFrench Toast-Triple D- dengerous, decadent, and delicious.  OH and heavy..  Comes with 2 pieces of toast smothered in caramel sauce and topped with hazelnut ice cream.  It was sinful and delicious but we were so full that we couldn't finish it.\n\nOur waiter was SO sweet.  We asked about the profiteroles and said that since we were ordering the french toast, we should order the profiteroles because they pair nicely together.

I admit, this was a little overwhelming for me!). We were surprised (in a pleasant way) by the very bold flavors in the Roquefort sauce. The black truffle/ pepper sauce was more subtle but just as delicious. \n\nThe special comes with the gratin and chard on the side (more than enough for two people).

The atmosphere was conducive for hubby and me to start chatting up the staff and other diners.

Crazy huh? \n\nBut oh this place is so incredibly darling. We tried here on a whim with a call Saturday night looking for last-minute open seats (usually an impossible task). He offered to save two seats at the bar and once off the phone we cabbed right over. \n\nThe restaurant was small and signage not clear from the street due to a huge tree at the front sidewalk. But the warm yellow tones, glimpse of white tablecloth, dark orange droplights over the bar, and tons of happy faces clustered around tables and engaged in avid conversation made us sure we had found the right place. \n\nThe owner/chef Philippe Gardelle is amazing. I find it incredible that after 10+ years he still maintains an energy and charisma that continues to permeate this place and make it so enchanting. He makes a point to welcome every guest that arrives at the door, but still manages to have a hand on all the dishes and desserts and even the wine that appear on the menu. He walks through the dining room, ensuring everyone has everything they need, and he is extra sure to bid them goodbye and help them call a taxi if they need it before they leave. As things calm down towards the end of service he even wipes down the outside covers of every single menu and makes sure the pages are secured. \n\nOn top of that, the food is divine and affordable for French fare without the stuffiness. You can make your own 3-course dinner for $38 (a little extra if your entree is seafood), 4-courses for $46, with a sorbet between appetizer & entree at $50.50. Come as an early bird and order between 5-6pm (excludes Fri & Sat) and the 3-course is $28. There are also plenty of affordable good wines under $40. \n\nThe \"Trio of Salmon\" was absolutely luxurious with salmon tartar wrapped by a ring of salmon gravlax, surrounded by a circle of creme fraiche and salmon roe, again by an outer ring of crispy fried capers and fluffy little bits of soft-boiled egg, and topped with microgreens and a crispy thin latticed chip. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" that came only with the four-course selection was diced stewed tomato and sprouts atop a perfectly cooked scallop resting on basil-green risotto and a ring of creamy lobster sauce. It was like living \"Ratatouille\", where each individual component was a little spark of light in my mouth that exploded into fireworks when mixed together. \n\nThe \"bouillabaisse\" was a clean and rich-flavored broth with two fish fillets in the center and four mussels around it. Served with crisp croutons made of french bread and two little side bowls of smoky rich aioli, shredded cheese. The \"Cassoulet de Toulouse\" used dried and reconstituted cannellini beans which gave a great texture, duck leg confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and a little toulouse sausage. It was really rich and comforting for the cold winter night although a little too salty. \n\nThey offer two palate cleansers in the form of sorbet served in a little triangle bowl with a shot of liquor poured in. We tried the \"Colonel\", a lemon-ginger sorbet with a shot of citris vodka that really made the ginger sharpen up. Be careful if you've already committed to wine though because it can effect the taste. \n\nFinally, les desserts. Oh dear god those desserts. Our neighbors had a molten chocolate cake that for everywhere else seemed so passe, but this was a beautiful cake that completely collapsed in the center, looking like a chocolate donut with the most oozy divine chocolate syrup. We also eyed the Creme Brulee with envy. But we chose the \"Profiteroles\" thinking it would be a light end of the meal. Oh no, it's stuffed with ice cream, liberally drizzled with melted chocolate ganache and topped with slivered almonds. The surprising winner was also the \"Basil Napoleon\". Yes, basil and dessert.

Superb! Once again scallop was perfectly cooked, which is much harder than doing the same with the prawns. Risotto still held on to the flavor and moisture necessary for a good risotto. The bisque was excellent as well. The dish balanced perfectly, and I loved how the flavors/elements didn't get in the way of each other.

The cauliflower soup was incredible, but it went downhill from there. The salad had too much dressing and the ingredients didn't blend. My husband was unimpressed with his salmon appetizer. But perhaps the biggest disappointment was the entrees. My pork literally had no flavor. How you can wrap something in bacon without imparting any flavor, I don't know, but it was incredibly bland. My husband said his skatewing had a strange texture and was also lacking in flavor. Both the dishes had excellent sauces but they couldn't quite compensate for the poor quality mains. The profiteroles were excellent, but couldn't redeem the disappointing remainder of the meal.

Bay Area\"... and that's the major reason my partner and I chose to celebrate my birthday there last night.  I love well prepared French cuisine: nouvelle or old-school, when it''s right, it's heaven.  What I saw on CPBA  convinced me it was worth an excursion. \n\nMore deciding factors in our choice of Chapeau included that escargot and duck breast be on the menu.  Bam!  \"Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic\", reads the menu, and that's what you get and then some.  I missed the novelty of the shells and hardware (I love props), but the baked escargot served in their own pools of clarified butter and an abundance of garlic and parsley was wicked... I had to make an effort not to fill myself up on baguette and the remainder of the tasty butter pools which would prevent me from enjoying the rest of the dishes to come.  The duck breast seemed to be made especially for me:  the medium rare was perfection; the duck breast succulent and tender.\n\nThe early bird special is a great choice if you plan on dining between 5 and 6 pm.  We wanted to get bang for our buck so we made reservations for 5:15 pm.  I'd online-researched a good Pinot Noir and picked up a bottle of Shea Vineyards, Oregon 2008 at K&L on 4th Street (fab place - unique wines and great staff knowledge and assistance).  Chapeau has an impressive wine list on its own, but again we were on bang-for-the-buck mode (isn't just about everyone these days) and with  Chapeau's corkage fee being $18, you can buy a mid- to expensive bottle of wine at retail, pay the corkage and avoid a 3-figure wine cost on your dinner bill.  I shared tastings with Philippe the owner and my waiter and they approved my choice.  \n\nOn that same theme, because the early bird / prix fixe menu is so affordable and it was my birthday afterall,  we ordered an additional starter for each of us: pan seared scallop on a little bed of pesto risotto served with a lobster reduction sauce.  It was charming and sublime.  A complete miniature dinner plate on its own, the scallop was hearty yet tender and flavorful; the risotto just the right side of al dente for my preference, and the lobster reduction a nice punctuation. Oh, and before I forget, I am a fussy and impatient diner, so I was disappointed to see the escargot and Philip's chestnut soup (excellent btw!) appear before the additional scallop appetizer we especially ordered.  We were told by our support waiter that the scallop would be served after the escargot which, I realized made much more sense for the sequence.  It was my bad wannabe gourmand party foul... and I appreciate the waiter's attention to detail. Not quite ready to jump into the Pinot Noir  I asked for a suggestion of white to go with the scallops.  The waiter seved me a perfectly paired Sancerre.\n\nAnd before I go on, there was a delightful amuse bouche of filet of anchovy in a bed of baked fio dough that we were served on the house before our meal began. \n\nAs I said, the duck breast was exactly the way I love it.  Philip's pork tenderloin was delectable.  And, as it was still my birthday dinner we again went bang-for-the-buck and each ordered an after dinner mesclun salad with a creme dijonnaise dressing, red seedless grapes, pistachio, fried camembert and toasted walnut bread.  A great way to change it up after your main course and before dessert.\n\nAs I dreaded, I was subjected to the happy birthday singing by the staff when my profiteroles came for dessert.  I'd expected something sinister when I saw Philip chatting with one of the waters at the door.  But the restaurant patrons joined in and sang sincerely and I was humbled and felt like I was really being feted.  \n\nI'm looking forward to my return to Chapeau!  The prix fixe menus starting at $38 for a three-course meal and $46 for four courses of your choice is sill a great bang-for-your-buck for outstanding French cuisine and service. \n\nBravo, Chapeau!

So I've gone and fixed things, but with the unaccented, plain vanilla English letters.  Everything else is the same. *sigh*  [end note]\n\nWell, I suppose it had to happen one of these days...a 5-star review.  Which can only mean one thing...I had an absolutely amazing meal and experience!  My father, who has \"dined all over the world, including in many Michelin star restaurants\" declared this place to be so amazing that he wrote on the comment card \"tous les saveurs sont magnifiques!  Merci bien pour une experience extraordinaire!\"  (if you'll forgive my butchering of French grammar).  \n\nDespite my dad's tendency for exaggeration and superfluous superlatives, this was truly a meal to remember.  The chef and owner, M. Phillipe Gardelle, quite obviously enjoys his craft and his attention to detail and inventiveness clearly shows through in every plate that leaves the kitchen.  And every time he runs out the door to bid adieu to his guests.  He told us he decided to come to San Francisco from France for 2 years - 15 years ago!  France's loss, our gain.\n\nM. Gardelle has created a fantastic restaurant tucked away in what's almost the middle of nowhere, nestled amongst synagogues, Chinese markets and restaurants, and a lot of houses.  The bistro is small and cramped, but not unpleasantly so.  We were lucky to get in because somebody canceled their reservation.  \n\nOn to the meal!  After going ga-ga over the menu, we were informed of the specials that evening - rib steak for two, served with gratin and marrow bones.  And if that wasn't enough for the third person at the table (who will remain nameless to protect her aura of innocence), they also had foie gras.  So that settled it for her, and decided that marrow bones required ordering that large steak, so she and my dad had that.  He had the moules avec pommes frites (the best damn frites I've ever had, possibly a tie), and I had the warm brie over a potato pancake served with some frisee of sorts.  All were absolutely amazing.  And so was the half glass of Sauternes wine that went with the foie gras.  Wow.\n\nThen we had decided to go for the 4 course menu because the \"fish tasting\" course consisted of a pan seared sea scallop (yum!) served on top of an \"open ravioli\" with butternut squash filling and a citrus honey sauce.  Now I'm not the biggest butternut squash fan in the room, but this was phenomenal.  The scallop was cooked to perfection (as my dad remarked many a time throughout the rest of the night), and the combination of flavours was completely unexpected and awesome.  (I'm going to run out of superlatives soon...)\n\nThe mains arrived, and the steak was sliced and served at the table for the other two diners.  Complete with rib bone and two giant marrow bones.  Even with meat served at the table, they went out of their way to present it impeccably, and I had a taste of the wonderful meat that was garnished with a bit of fleur de sel and served with four amazing sauces - roquefort, bearnaise, peppercorn, and truffle.  I tasted all four, and the roquefort and truffle were the very clear winners to the point of making me want to grab the little dish and just drink the stuff down.\n\nHaving just had a steak the previous night (see my review of Sundance...it's nice when parents visit!), I had opted for the cassoulet, which is apparently a French peasant-ish kind of dish.  Either way, it consisted of white beans (which normally I'm not a big fan of, but decided to go for it anyways), braised lamb, a duck leg, and a small sausage.  The duck meat fell apart in my mouth and the lamb was already largely mixed in with the sauce.  The sausage was incredible.\n\nAnd then as if this kind of gluttony wasn't enough, we couldn't forget the dessert portion of the 4 course menu.  Most of them looked and sounded amazing.  We collectively had the chocolate cake (totally worth the 10 minutes for them to make it from scratch), the profiteroles, and and orange concoction that contained orange sorbet, creme de menthe, and Grand Marnier.  All were excellent.  And we also got a serving of a fourth dessert, the diced fruits in basil cream and with thin cookies.  Heavenly, all of it.\n\nThe wine was also excellent - a Hautes Cotes de Nuits that nicely complemented all of our meals.  And taking a look through the wine list, I was completely impressed with the selection, the prices, and also just how easy it was to find the kind of wine you were looking for.\n\nAll in all, Chapeau! lives up to its name, both for bringing the bill in a chapeau, and for making you go wow! many times during the meal.\n\nSante!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-03-06"}, {"excerpts": ["And for dessert:\n- Vanilla creme brulee (perfect balance of vanilla, egg, and sugar crust)\n- Warm chocolate cake\n- Profiteroles (to rival the ones at Bofinger in Paris)\n"], "author": "Sarah B.", "review": "As the name implies, Wow!

We were able to make reservations at 6:30 for 8:30.  Kokkari (greek) said they could only do 9:30.  Great in either case!  We walked in and half the restaurant was empty.  It was rather quiet as well.  Not sure about the other reviews when they say that it was loud.  I was perturbed by how 3 employees walked past us on there way to doing something...each one aknowledging us but not seating us.  I guess they have no actual \"hostess\".  They have no hostess stand either.  Our server eventually ended up seating us at a 2-top which I thought was odd considering they had sooo many tables open.  Before we got seated, my date even asked if I wanted to leave! (yes, it was that odd).\n\nWe finally got seated and the server asked us if we would like to start with a drink before dinner.  We both knew we wanted wine but no wine list had been provided!  She asked him (but not me) \"sparkling or still\" and then walked away.  The inattentive service stopped there.  When she came back she was very helpful with the wine list and the menu.  We never once had to pour our own wine, each course was staged well, and the employees all worked fluidly as a team to create a wonderful experience. \n\nI had the $38 3-course menu and my date had the $48 4-course menu.  We each ordered a palate cleanser as well.  \nTiny cups of Truffled Squash Flowered Soup :  these were on the house.  I truly got excited when I saw how perfectly the chive garnish had been cut.  This attentin to detail was carried throughout the meal. \nOysters :  great minonette with black peppercorns... worked well and they oysters were nicely shucked.\nSweetbreads : very rich!  Nicely prepared and mild in flavor.  Trumpet mushrooms with a foie gras and truffle reduction butter sauce.  Oh my!  \nPalate cleansers : Apple one was a bit syrupy and the citrus one was realllllyyy strong in the vodka flavor!  I dont think they can serve that one to a minor!\nScallop \"tasting fish\" option:  Absolutely wonderful.  I am not a scallop person but these were perfectly prepared,  Pesto risotto base, seared scallop, tomato compote topping and a sweet bbq-esque sauce round the plate.\nEntrees:\nFilet Mignon : Actually MELTED in your mouth.  Oh wow!  \nRack of Lamb : A bit overdone ( I had asked for medium rare to rare).  But still very yummy!  It came with an eggplant mash, artichoke hearts, roasted cloves of garlic, and baked peppers (a little mushy).  \n\nDessert: Chocolate Lava Cake with banana caramel and banana filling.  The fruit threw us off a bit.\nProfiteroles :  Filled with ice cream that could have had more vanilla flavor. I have had better desserts.  \n\nWhile some things were definitely 5 star (filet and sweetbreads), some things were off (vodka palate cleanser, hostess, hard to navigate wine list, profiteroles)\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

The place was packed with people waiting at the bar.  For dinner, I opted for the prix-fixe menu, where you could select an appetizer, entree, and dessert for a pretty decent price.  For appetizer, I ordered the deep fried tiger prawns.  It was good and the batter was light and crispy.  My friend got the onion soup, which I tried and also thought was tasty. The cheese was nicely melted and gooey.  For my entree, I got the special that night, which was the pan seared scallops over risotto. This was good.  I enjoyed it.  Hubby got the duck and that was pretty good too.  My friend got the filet mignon and asked for it medium rare but unfortunately, it came out almost well done, so it was tough and chewy, without a lot of flavor.  Her husband got the pork tenderloin and it was a bit on the bland side, as well.  When the server came over to ask how our entrees were, my friend told him the filet was overcooked.  The server was very nice about it and apologized and offered to take it back, but since they already ate half of it, they didn't want to make a big fuss.  To make it up to us, they gave us 2 desserts on the house, in addition to the ones we already ordered.  That put our total to 7 desserts.  LOL.  It was definitely dessert overload.  I really enjoyed the napoleon, surprisingly.  I didn't think I would like it but I really enjoyed how fresh it was with the all the fruits.  It definitely wasn't like a traditional napoleon.  My other favorite was the profiteroles.  The french toast was interesting since I would typically associate that with breakfast rather than dessert.  It was a bit sweet for me because of the caramel they drizzled on top, but my hubby really liked it.  Overall, the experience at Chapeau was good but not great.

I loved the sauce and the scallops were cooked to produce the perfect texture.  I would say it's even Gary Danko scallop quality.  However the risotto for the dish was a bit too hard.  They should've cooked it a bit longer.  \n\nI loved the boullabaise.  And again, the scallop in there was perfect.  The fish and mussels were amazing.  The sauce may be a tad too salty for some people, but I don't mind saltiness. I just loved the flavor.  The bacon wrapped pork tenderloins were really good.  It was so tender cooked at medium temperature.  It blended nicely in the sauce.  I typically don't like sweet sauces.  However, this was just a hint of sweetness, so it wasn't that overpowering.  \n\nWe had the baked alaska, which was a bit sweet for my taste.  It's just the meringue.  The chocolate sauce, ice cream, and nuts were awesome.  Just having a little bit of the meringue with the rest of the dessert made it much better b/c it wasn't that sweet.

Let's just say that the dinner I had at Chapeau! was one of the latest dinners I've ever had in my life--I'm definitely guilty of being extremely HANGRY by the time we got seated around 9:50pm for our 9:45pm reservation. \n\nI can see why this quaint little restaurant was packed on a Saturday night, and my friend who made the reservation said she had trouble booking a table for us a week+ in advance. Chapeau! definitely reminds me of homestyle French cooking w/ a unique San Francisco twist to it. \n\nAll 6 of us ordered from the prix fixe menu-- which was absolutely SUCH a deal (3 courses for $44.50) Wowzers! \n\nFor my appetizer, I chose the Trio of Salmon- which I thought was on the saltier side, but still delish nonetheless. The salmon tasted quite smokey and overall it reminded me of an Asian fusion inspired dish.\n\nFor the entree I chose the Canard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices. THIS, was the highlight of the meal. I mean, if I would go back to Chapeau!, I would most likely just order this entree and be an extremely happy camper. Now, I love eating duck, especially with the way it is prepared in French cuisine. However, the overall portions at this restaurant are HUGE, and I had to struggle to finish the last 4 pieces of this entree...but I did anyway, and felt like a champ! \n\nThe palate was great and I believe reminded me of cauliflower. It was creamy and I think at this point, filled me up. \n\nFor dessert, I picked the Baked Alaska- Disclaimer: this was the first baked alaska I'd had in my life, yeah-- where have I been right? Anyway, it was good, but not spectacular. I tried my friend's profiteroles--and those, my fellow Yelpers, were AMAZING. I was swept up to cloud 9 by those profiteroles. Heck, I'd probably eat a dozen at one sitting. They really are just that good!! \n\nI think overall, the portions were huge and satisfying, and the hospitality was excellent. The Chef made sure to greet us at the door as we were waiting to get seated (arriving 15 min earlier than the reservation) and proceeded to give each one of us a hug and kisses on the cheek as we left (which I heard is a thing from one of my coworkers), which I found wonderfully adorable. Oh, and on top of giving my friend a candle with her dessert, they also gave us a complimentary French Toast and Basil Napoleon. I didn't have room in my stomach to try the French Toast, but judging from my friends' ooo's and ahh's, they seemed really happy which was wonderful. The Basil Napoleon was extremely fresh and fruity, and my friend's creme brulee came in the biggest ramskin (in terms of diameter) that I had ever seen in a restaurant.

I knew that couldn't be all that French cuisine was about.  Additionally, the prices are really good for what you're getting.  \n\nFor appetizer, I had the foie gras ($18) layered on top of special bread and came with some sliced apples, greens, and sauce.  Forgive my pathetic description but I was delighted to taste just how fatty the foie gras.  The portion was perfect for two people to enjoy but not be overwhelmed by the heaviness the liver.\n\nThe menu online seems to be a bit outdated so if you're really curious, I'd give the restaurant a call to see what they have.  I ended up getting the rabbit leg stuffed with spinach and came with thumbelina carrots, seasoned grains, and a plum ($28).  It felt like the French interpretation of an American Thanksgiving dinner.  I really enjoyed how the rabbit was cooked and the overall balance of flavors.\n\nMy man's dish was the rack of lamb special and at $37, it's more expensive than the entrees on the menu but this is so worth it!  The portion is generous and they give you about 4 pieces of lamb in addition to ratatouille and a side dish of potatoes au gratin.  The ratatouille was so amazing because the zucchini was cooked perfectly (I always overcook zucchini on accident so I appreciate this).  I've had homemade ratatouille before from a French person and wondered why people were so fond of this bland dish but Chapeau makes me a believer.  Who knew vegetables could be so good?  The potatoes au gratin is loaded with garlic and comes in a dish with a diameter of 5\" so it's a lot.  This was a really hearty but flavor intense dish.\n\nI don't know how long the Baked Alaska dessert has been on their menu but it seems to be making a comeback from the '70s when my dad worked in the restaurant business and this was a popular dessert.

I got the veal sweetbreads while she got the trio of salmon. The trio of salmon was a very well constructed dish, something that wouldn't be out of place at a place like Commis.

Problem solved!\n\nThe meal started innocuously with a super flavorful, crusty bread with butter that had just enough salt. An amuse bouche of cauliflower soup was served, which would actually become my favorite dish I had all night. It was perfectly seasoned and finished off with a drop of truffle oil. (Truffle oil is one of those ingredients that is somewhat looked down upon by master chefs since it is basically just a manufactured aromatic and not actually a truffle-infused oil. While I wouldn't serve it to Chef Ramsey, I do enjoy a drop or two in my favorite dishes.)\n\nFor our first course, my girlfriend and I enjoyed their trio of salmon and a creamy yellow corn soup.  The salmon was served as stack with gravlax, tartare, and caviar, with egg mimosa, fried capers, and creme fraiche and the soup was served with a deep fried crab cake and white truffle oil.  The salmon dish was fantastic and each component builds on top of the flavor of the last.  The whole dish comes together in a single bite.  The soup was super refreshing and paired perfectly with the crab cake.  I could have done without the drizzle of truffle oil in this case, but it did add a rich dimension to the soup.\n\nOur main courses included the cassoulet de toulouse and oven roasted wild atlantic salmon.  The cassoulet was served with canellini beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, and garlic and toulouse sausage, while the salmon came with a fondue provencale, fennel confit, parsley oil, and roasted bell pepper sauce.  The cassoulet was rich and the sausage was delicious, and the meat fell right off the bone of the duck leg.  It might have been a tad over-seasoned but the dish was otherwise executed very well.  The salmon was cooked to medium-rare, something I didn't know was possible.  I loved it, and that's how I'm going to cook mine from now on.  It was perfectly seasoned and light, tender, and amazing.

I like how the rabbit was shredded, I've had rabbit before in other places but it was tough. But this wasn't the case here. It was tender and it had a good amount of juice in it.  \n\nFor the main course i had the Filet Mignon with the bone marrow.  The Filet Mignon was good it was tender, I loved the potatoes that it came with. The potatoes were so good and the sauce with the steak was every more tasty. It was my first time eating bone marrow. i was able to scrap all to the bottom and use the spoon to spoon it out. The tasted like foie gras! It was super yummy but too bad it was as small portion.   My friend got the Wild Caught Skate Wing. It wasn't dry and it had a good amount of sauce on it.  It tasted very smooth and silky\n\nFor dessert, we got the baked Alaska and the French toast.  The french toast was very soft and it was covered in caramel. It wasn't too bad, and it went perfectly with the coffee ice cream. I hope to find a way to make it exactly like theirs at home. My friend got the Baked Alaska, It had the Italian Meringue, with rum sponge cake inside and the ice cream inside as well.. I like the outside of it more, because of the texture. The inside had a very strong rum taste to it. So it's perfect for you rum lovers\n\nOverall, i enjoyed my experience here, and I can't wait to come back, but i now know to make reservations far in advance. If not i don't mind just coming here just for desserts.  Our waitress was super nice and gave excellent service.

Philippe was breezing through the dining area, greeting guests but made a point to come over to our table & shake hands with everyone. What a warm welcome :\n\nMost of us opted for the 4 course option. Our waiter brought us a chilled sorbet-liked 'soup' which is said to have palate-cleansing power, served in an espresso size cup. Not sure if our palates were cleansed but the bread that they served while we waited for our appetiser was indeed heavenly with a hint of garlic, soft on the inside but crispy on the outside. I ordered Trio of Salmon where the salmon gravlax is used to hold the salmon tartar n its round shape, surrounded by egg mimosa & sprinkles of caviar & fried capers to complete the plate. Its a 4-star appetiser because of the fried capers. I had a sample of the mussel & it was delectable too, especially when the bread soaked up all the delicious goodness.\n\nFor the 'fish tasting' it is a pan-seared scallop sitting on a bed of risotto. My scallop was cooked just right but some of the others were slightly over-cooked. The risotto, to me came in slightly under-cooked as I could still bite into the crunchy bits. Next was the much anticipated entree. My left brain had to fight with my right brain... duck or lamb, duck or lamb, duck or lamb... I decided on the 'Special' - lamb-shank. Verdict??? I was disappointed.. what?!?!?!?! yup, you heard me right. DISAPPOINTED!!! It was too salty and the sauce was too sweet for my liking. As none of us ordered the duck, I am still intrigue as to how that would turn out. Maybe that's my excuse to go back there in future\n\nThe most important course of the dinner was of course dessert ;) With 8 of us ordering desserts, I had a chance to sample the Baked Alaska (ice-cream with rum cake), creme brulee and the french toast. French toast top the list. Bummer that I only had just one teeny-weeny bite *sigh*\n\nOn our way out, Philippe was at the door, cheek kissing us gals. Didn't pay attention if the guys shake hands or cheek kissed as well.\n\nWith all the highs & lows, it was overall an enjoyable experience. Food is a 3.5-star, partly due to me comparing it to the french food I had in Montreal (that's the most french-liked place I visited so far ;p) but the service & Philippe's warm greetings bumped it up to a 4-star for now", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the Baked Alaska and my boyfriend the French Toast.

After reading a good amount of reviews beforehand, we were delighted to know that the service here is awesome! However, I honestly didn't think the service we received was anything too great. Yes, right when we entered, we were greeted by the welcoming hostess and the chef which was awesome! But the rest of our time there consisted of: our server quickly taking down our order, people just dropping off our food without any clear details of what each course was, no water refills for about 20 minutes of my boyfriend's cup being completely empty, absolutely no check ups or asking us if we enjoyed the food/needed anything else, and a long time to receive our bill. Don't get me wrong, the staff was extremely friendly, but the service wasn't as great as we had read. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was delicious! We both decided to go with the Menu 2: your choice of appetizer, tasting fish, choice of entr\u00e9e, and choice of dessert. They first started us off with complimentary bread of course, which was good! (Partially because we were starving at that point already). It came with (onion?) soup which I really loved. \n\n** Appetizers! I got the foie gras and my boyfriend the trio of salmon. The foie gras was amazing!! Came with toasted brioche, slices of fresh apples, with a delicious Gew\u00fcrztraminer gelatin on the plate. It was actually my first time having foie gras, so I can't really compare it to anything. But it surely hit the spot. My boyfriend's salmon appetizer was good as well; I loved how citrus-y it was. \n\n** Tasting fish! It was a seared scallop with a pesto risotto and lobster sauce. Oh gosh... this was too amazing. I'm somewhat of a pesto freak, so I absolutely loved this course! Everything on this plate was so balanced and mouth-watering.\n\n** Entr\u00e9es! We both got the filet mignon, with extra $5 bone marrow, and extra $8 Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine. So amazing! Cooked to perfection, and was super juicy. Bone marrow was a little bit on the salty side, but still delicious. I forgot to also mention that the boyfriend and I both had a glass of wine, but sadly I can't remember the name. Our server chose for us because he said it pairs well with filet mignon and he was so right.\n\n** Desserts! I got the Baked Alaska and my boyfriend the French Toast. I fell in love with the baked alaska.. Rum spongecake, rich chocolate sauce, toasted almond slices, coffee ice cream, and meringue.. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it. My boyfriend's french toast was great as well. \n\nI did write down it was my boyfriend's birthday on opentable, but I guess they forgot.. So I had to remind our server and he rushed back to get a candle. Boo :/ \n\nOverall, we had a good experience. Decent service, delicious food.

The plate was beautiful and we didn't want to eat it, but we did. The eggs and capers definitely added some depth flavorwise, but my favorite way of salmon was probably either the gravlax (which was like cured salmon) or the tartare. Yum!\n-Tasting Fish (Seared Dayboat Scallops with Pesto Risotto and Lobster Sauce): This was a really small dish - especially because it was split between the two of us. The scallop was not that large - somewhat expected something bigger and more risotto. Regardless, it was delicious, though small. \n-Striped Bass (Saut\u00e9ed Striped Bass & Braised Oxtail, Roasted Garlic Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, Caramelized Pearl Onion, Jus de Poulet): YUM. This was definitely really good. It is their take on a surf and turf. The striped bass was perfected cooked and the braised oxtail with the mashed potatoes created this beautiful mixture of food. \n-Baked Alaska (Sponged Rum Cake, Espresso Ice Cream, Italian Meringue, Chocolate Sauce, Candied Toasted Almonds): Since my girlfriend had never had baked alaska before, we decided to try it. Honestly, I love me some cake and ice cream topped with meringue so I had no complaints .However, it was overly sweet in some ways.

I've been wanting to try this restaurant since over a year ago when someone recommended it to me as one of her favorite restaurants in SF. Well, that's a pretty tall order. Tried to make reservations here back in February for Valentine's Day, but they were completely packed! So the sweetie that my bf is, he remembered I wanted to try this place and booked it as a random surprise for me. Lesson learned: make a reservation in advance!!\n\nYou can order a la carte or from their \"Menu options.\" Meaning either a 3 or 4 or 5 course meal. And the nice thing is, both people do NOT have to do the same option, whereas some places will dictate that you need to. So I got a 3 course ~$40 (choose your own appetizer, entry, dessert) and my bf got the 4 course ~$50, which included a tasting fish. Some options you may have to add a few extra dollars for that choice.\n\nFor appetizers, we got the trio of salmon and the corn soup. The salmon trio was yum!! And very pretty. I love fried capers too. Now, the bf picked the corn soup because there the word \"giant prawn\" in the description, but really...there was only one giant prawn and the rest was corn soup. HAHA...howeverrrr....I thought the soup was absolutely delicious! I love creamy corn soups and this was just the right consistency and sweetness. He was upset there was only one prawn haha\n\nThe tasting fish was a sort of scallop dish. TBH, I couldn't understand the thick French accent of our waiter for the life of me. All I heard were the words \"scallop\" and \"mango\"...which is a weird combination. But this scallop looked kind of like it was deconstructed and flattened. Topped with mango cubes, parsnips, some crunchy nut (maybe hazelnuts...) SOUNDS WEIRD I KNOW. You just had to try it. It was pretty damn good.\n\nEntrees, we got the roasted duck breast and Cassoulet de Toulouse--which had canellini beans,  lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, garlic & toulouse sausage. Roasted duck breast was really tender, the veggies and polenta with it were good...I thought it was better than the one we had at Redd in Napa. Food was solid, wasn't super blown away, but you can tell they definitely put a lot of thought into the food and I enjoyed it.\n\nDesserts: baked alaska (yummy rum cake with espresso ice cream and tahitian vanilla creme brulee...both were solid.\n\nHonestly, I might be okay with just ordering off the menu, but it was a great experience and I would be down to try more things here. But mostly, the ambiance was great and service was excellent as you could expect from French dining. The poor waitress must have thought my bf was a fish because he drank so much water, but she just kept on refilling without a word and without fail. We also got a cozy seat for two in the back booth and we were more than half an hour late for our reservation due to stupid new Bay Bridge traffic, but they called us and held the spot.\n\nThe executive chef, Phillipe, came to offer us the dessert menu and I saw him doing wine pairings for most people. He also wouldn't let me leave without a few pecks on the cheek. Literally...he stuck out his arm to block my pathway as he was talking to other guests to say goodbye to me before I left.

We literally waited for almost 20 mins till the waiter came to ask us what drinks we would like to order. I guess the upside is that the executive chef always came out to ask around how's the food. \nIt was too noisy for a fine dining restaurant and they put the small table supre close to each other, which I literally can hear the next table's convo.\n\nMaybe I would go back again on a non-busy night give a try since I heard so many good things about Chapeau!

Now, I sit here confused, because it wasn't that long ago (less than a year) that I experienced such fantastic food and service at this bistro.  Perhaps things changed since my time there.

I usually never comment on service, but they were so helpful, polite, and attentive that I had to mention it.  Took my friend here for her bday..we shared a 3 course & 4 course meal.  The only difference between the 3 & 4 course is the \"tasting fish,\" which that night was scallop on risotto over lobster bisque.  (which is very delish, by the way.  I loved the various flavors the dish offered. It was because of this dish that we had one person order the 4 course meal so we could share it...great decision).\n\nAppetizers:\n1) Escargot: very strong garlic flavor.  Since we like garlic, we enjoyed this dish, but you really have to love garlic to like this dish b/c the flavor is so potent.  It was also served drier than I'm used to.  The escargot is soft, but it's not drenched in a puddle of butter like how other places serve it.  Eat this after other appetizers or else the garlic taste will alter the flavor of the other meals (the owner gave us this tip & even brought this out after the other dishes...see?  Great service)\n2) Foie Gras:  ORDER this b4 it's outlawed in CA.  Buttery, rich, dense goodness.  Warm & seared to perfection.  Served w/ toast.\n\nEntree:\n1) Mussels:  FAVORITE of the night.  Must order.  Mussels are juicy & fresh and the broth it sits in is delicious.  It's also served with fries, which taste good dipped in the 2 sauces it comes with or even in the broth (owner recommended that).  \n2) Duck breast: this dish was only ok.  Meat was tender, but I didn't care too much for the flavor...also, the flavor was a bit on the light side & almost bland.\n\nDessert:\n1) Nuage de Noix: Owner recommended this one and it was the favorite of the 2 desserts we tried.

The wine by the glass selection was a little small, but they do conveniently offer half glasses if you're not much of a drinker.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu, which was pretty reasonable at $40 for 3 courses and $49 if you want to add the tasting fish (my gf did).  Bread was fresh, hot, and crusty, and we received amuse-bouche of cauliflower soup which was creamy, delicious, and an unexpected surprise.  My onion soup appetizer was excellent.  The onions were sweet and soft and the gruyere wasn't an overwhelming obstacle on top of the cup but rather the perfect amount.  My girlfriend's salad nicoise was also very good, the ahi was a little too peppery, but the quail egg and perfectly cooked potatoes made up for it.  The tasting fish came next, which was a large seared scallop served over basil pesto risotto with lobster sauce.  This was the best thing I ate all night, a perfectly cooked scallop, the flavors complimented each other so well, really an outstanding preparation.  For the main course I had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin served on top of whipped parsnip and baked apple slices with shaved brussel sprouts and an apple and brown sugar sauce.  The sweetness of the apple went well with the salty bacon and almost bitter parsnip.  I love pork tenderloin, and the dish did not disappoint.

It's a cozy restaurant. The tables and chairs are pretty close together.  The ambiance is nice, not too loud and not too dark.  \n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and brought two of our own as well.  Our server was very nice and made an effort to accommodate us as much as possible which I appreciated.  \n\nWe each ordered the prefixed menu option 1 and a couple of their specials as appetizers for the table. \n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nFoie Gras: Delicious!!

It comes with this large pesto/garlic covered french bread crouton and they pair it with some pomme frites.  The server recommended that we dip/soak the fries in the muscle broth and my gosh that was a pair made in heaven!  \n\n\nSPECIALS:\nWe ordered a couple entree sized specials for the table - a scallop risotto.  For an entree size, it was still relatively small - it came with 4 scallops on top of a bed of creamy risotto.  Kind of reminded me of cream of mushroom sauce and rice - but of course much better than that :)\n\n\nENTREE:\nFilet Mignon - I had the filet mignon medium rare and a few others at the table ordered the same dish, except they added the bone marrow.  I'm not a fan of bone marrow so I can't give any kind of accurate description of that except that it looked cool, but I still wouldn't eat it.  The meat was perfect - very juicy, not too rare but exactly how a medium rare steak should be.  The filet itself is known to be the nicest cut of the meat, and this was no exception.  I can't even remember what it was paired with but who cares, if it didn't come with anything else I'd still order it.\n\nDESSERT:\nThis is the only reason why I had to take off one star.  When I made this reservation, I read a yelp review that mentioned their souffle and I thought, YES, finally Souffle!! My whole family LOVES LOVES souffle.. in fact, sometimes after eating out we contemplate going to Mortons just to order one of their souffles.  Let's face it - a souffle is not easy to get and not many restaurants have them because you need an on-site pastry chef.  A tip for all you souffle lovers out there: YOU NEED TO CALL AT LEAST 24 HRS PRIOR TO YOUR RESERVATION IF YOU WANT TO ORDER A SOUFFLE AT YOUR DINNER.  Contrary to the normal \"30 minutes advanced notice\" only applies to restaurants with an on-site pastry chef.  Actually, that was the first question I asked when we were seated - \"we're going to order souffle\".  I was seriously crushed when I was told the sad news.  I wish I had known that was an option!  I guess I just figured that an upscale FRENCH restaurant would serve souffle :(  Instead I ordered their chocolate lava cake which was a total mistake haha. Not a fan.. but nothing comes close to what I wanted.\n\nThe creme brulee was good, same taste as it should have - no complaints there.  My sister had the Baked Alaska but wasn't a huge fan.  The rest ordered the sorbet or the chocolate cake - but since I started the rumor that they had souffle the chocolate cake didn't stand a chance.  My mom on the other hand ordered their french toast.  Who would have thought something that sounded so simple could have such a unique and amazing taste!  Actually, her dessert came out after everyone else finished theirs for some reason, which didn't matter much to her because she was full, and so were we... but once we had a taste of that toast, we all chowed down like we hadn't had a meal in days.  \n\nThe chef also came out to shake everyone's hands and introduce himself which I thought was very nice of him to take the time to do that.  He must love what he does and it's nice that he came out to actually see everyone who was dining there.  Very nice touch.  \n\nI had to take down 1 star solely based on my disappointment on their dessert.  I would definitely come back again.

The striped bass is very tender; not fishy at all, and I would recommend it for those of you who like eating without having to cut anything. The filet minion is also very tender, but costs a bit more. \nThe baked Alaska was very good, but I prefer the chocolate cake more because I have a sweet tooth. For those who don't like sweets very much, I recommend getting the baked Alaska. I haven't yet tried other desserts, so I have to wait to write about the rest. \nThis time that I went to Chapeau, the food was good, but the waiter D. Laurent, was a bit mean maybe because we look young or we are not French. He had a big attitude towards me and my boyfriend, but during the whole time we were there, we tried to be nice(Since it cost so much, we tried to make the best of everything). When we were ready to order, he ignored us for 20 minutes after he saw us raise our hand, and when he finally came to serve us, he seemed mad about something. I gave him a smile and ordered, but he was cold the whole time. The person who brought us our food was a lady, she was very nice, and at least she smiled. \nAfter eating our first course, there were a lot of bread crumbs on the table and when our server came to get our plates, he didn't even look at us. Then he went inside the kitchen and didn't even return to clean our table like the other server did. Then he went to the table next to us and acted very nice to them, he even smiled. This sort of made me mad, and I tried to get my mind off it by cleaning the bread crumbs off the table waiting for the dessert to come. When I was in the middle of putting the crumbs on the napkin, he came ans said \"I bet You got some on the floor\" then he rolled his eyes in front of me and my boyfriend caught it as well, and he walked away. This was probably the worst time I had ever had on a date at this restaurant. The whole time I was thinking what I did wrong, but then I realized he was probably just thinking I look like a kid.

Superb French meal that exceeded my expectations.  \n\nMy family and I took my mama here to celebrate her birthday and it was definitely the right choice.\n\nService:  I called two days before and luckily scored a reservation at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  We were greeted by the Chef and seated immediately.  Legit.  Our waiter had a very thick French accent, which was hard to understand at times.  He even called us madam and misses. Gentleman brownie points.  I was tempted to joke and say bonjourno monsieur but held back.\n\nThey served unlimited fresh sliced baguettes which was awesome. What was best was that we didn't have to ask the waiters for refill. They knew wassup and gave us another fresh basket right away.  We probably went through 5 baskets of those bad boys. The bread was extra crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just the way I like it. \nOh, and every time you walk away from the table or if the napkin is left unfolded on the table, ::ZOOM:: next thing you see is a waiter re-folding the napkin back in place. \n\nFood:  We all went with the prix fixed three course meal for $38.  I made sure each family member got something different so we could sample each dish.\n\nAppetizer (in order of my favorite)\n- Pan Seared Foie Gras w sliced apples (additional $6)\n- Traditional Onion Soup\n- Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, tartar & caviar, egg mimosa, fried capers & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, micro herbs with Lemon Dressing.\n- Tomato Bisque with deep fried crab cake  \n\nEverything was divine.  The Foie Gras was bomb diggity ding dongalicious.  It had a nice crisp on the outside topped with a pear glazed sauce.  Once you bite into it, it melted like butter.  That's a big statement coming from someone who usually doesn't like fatty meat.  The sliced apples gave a crisp contrast taste with the Foie Gras.\n\nThe onion soup had a great cheesy crunch on the top and right when you dive your spoon in, you enter a heaven full of melted cheese, crunchy bread bits, and onion soup.  Best part was that it wasn't overly salty like most onion soups.  One step closer to obesity? Perhaps.  Delicious?  Oh, you know it, baby.\n\nThe Trio of Salmon had a beautiful presentation.  The smoked salmon was light and complimented well with the dressing.  I actually really enjoyed the little fried capers sprinkled around, it gave a nice texture to everything.\n\nNow the only appetizer that was slightly disappointing was the crab cake with tomato bisque.  I like my crab cake extra crispy but the ball came a little soggy since it was placed in the tomato bisque.  However, the crab and the tomato bisque had a great consistency.  Dip the bread into the soup! \n\nMain Entr\u00e9e:\n- Rack of Lamb special served in a bed of au gratin\n- Filet Mignon with oyster mushrooms and stir-fried potatoes (additional $6)\n- Salmon with red bell peppers and sweet corn \n\nOut of these three entrees, the rack of lamb wins hands down.  My dad got it done medium and it was so tender, juicy, moist. Any word that makes you want to reply with \"that's what she said.\"  I wasn't a big fan of lamb until I had this perfectly cooked meat. \n\nI had the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was juicy and tender.  Not as tender as that lamb though.  The mushrooms and potatoes went great with the sauce and meat.  Best filet mignon I've ever had? No. But definitely up there. \n\nBoth my mom and bro got the Salmon for a healthier option and after trying them meats, it sure tasted healthy! It came crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  It was served with this spinach puree sauce I wished had a little more flavor so I decided to stick to my meat. \n\nOnto Dessert! Finally! \n- French Toast with soft caramel and hazelnut ice cream\n- Tahitian vanilla creme brulee\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, rum-raisin ice cream, caramel sauce.\n- Basil Napoleon maui pineapple, manilla mango, banana, kiwi & strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream\n\nFrench toast. ::drool::  Just get it. It was heavenly.  It came out warm and soft with this amazing caramel sauce and went great with the ice cream. My whole family scarfed that baby down so fast like a nascar.  \n\nThe Cr\u00e8me Bruelee came in a big portion! I likey.  I do wish the top was more crunchy, but it was light and not overly sweet.  \n\nHoly cow, did I need some milk for this Chocolate cake!  It was extremely rich and creamy.  Right when you pop that sucker out...warm chocolate oozes out so fast.  My family couldn't finish this because it was too heavy. \n\nAnything that tastes too healthy to me does not have that yummy factor.  Basil Napoleon had great chopped fruits in it but it was nothing comparable to the others..  \n\nMy parents have been to Paris multiple times and claim this was better than the meals they've had there.

The chips at the side served as a nice complement to the salad, a softer and easier to chew version of the croutons found in a salad, yet still remaining crunchy. The cherry on top for this appetizer though, was the duck at the top. I love Peking duck, and I expected to chew right through this one but it instantly melted in my mouth causing instant palate gratification and sensory overload. This part alone made this appetizer worth it, eat it slowly. *\n\nEntree:\nCassoulet de Toulouse: In simpler English terms, the main course appeared to be breaded lamb swimming in a sea of canellini beans. Like the other meat in this restaurant, everything is so soft and my teeth literally cut through the lamb like butter. The beans were mixed in a sauce and made the meal filling. The garlic and toulouse sausage was OK, I've had juicier and softer sausage.\n\nDessert:\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake: Very hot, crispy chocolate cake that started 'bleeding' liquid chocolate once I cut into it. In the middle I found caramelized banana sorta like a hidden gem, props for the aesthetics of the meal. To the side was the creamiest vanilla ice-cream I have ever eaten, which made a cool compliment to the hot fudge. I also sampled my friend's French Toast which she got at the waiter's suggestion, and I must say that they transformed the french toast like an art. The soft, spongy french toast was a full-circle end to the satisfying meal (and if i were to go back again, I would definitely get this instead.... maybe I have a grass is greener on the other side envy).\n\nAmbiance was a little crowded, as this is a small restaurant but service was definitely unprecedented, even for an upscale restaurant like this.

Sadly, it was not. I think we fell for the hype and expected too much. We wanted to be blown away and we kinda were but for totally the wrong reasons. \n\nWe were seated right away since we had reservations. Our server gave us menus and took our drink order. He gave us the specials and came back with water and bread. We looked over the menu and made our decisions but had to wait a bit for our server to come by. While we were waiting, another couple was seated next to us. Since the tables are so close together, we actually became friendly with them. \n\nWe both ordered the prix fixe menu 1. \nI had:\n- Salade Landaise: Fris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret, Fingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette\n- Wild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter, Fingerling Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, Banana Flamb\u00e9e & Rum-Raisin Ice Cream,\nCaramel Sauce \n\nThe hubby had:\n- the special foie gras\n- Cassoulet de Toulouse: Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder,\nDuck Leg Confit, Garlic & Toulouse Sausage \n- French Toast, Soft Caramel, Hazelnut Ice Cream \n\nThe server brought a complimentary roasted cauliflower soup which came in a demi tasse. Really good and was great with the warm bread and butter. \n\nThe chef came out to make his rounds and greeted everyone. Nice touch I thought. \n\nOur appetizers arrived and we really enjoyed them. I loved my salad and wished there were more duck in it. The hubby liked his foie gras too.\n\nOur neighbors got mussels and raved about them. \n\nThen we waited a REALLY long time for our entrees to come. Our neighbors got their entrees before we did. We were all a little shocked since we had arrived at least 30 minutes before them. \n\nOur server was no where to be found. \n\nWe not only were hungry since a lot of time had gone by since our appetizers but we just wanted to see how much longer it was going to be. Our neighbors were almost done with their food when we finally got a hold of our server who just came by and said \"I'll go check on your entrees\" and walked off. \n\nWe were actually thinking of leaving but decided against it since it was our anniversary. If we were anywhere else on any other day, we would have just asked for the check for the apps and been out. \n\nCouple of minutes went by and he came back to say \"They are working on them\" and walked off. Then we waited some more. By this time our neighbors were done with their entrees. I was not happy. \n\nWe finally got our entrees and even though I was hungry, my skate wing was just ok. My hubby did not like his dish at all. We thought the food would be amazing and it was just ok. It was very disappointing after waiting that long. \n\nOur neighbors and we started talking and we didn't like that our server was so nonchalant about our wait. A simple \"I'm sorry for the wait\" or any information or some sort of apology would have been nice. Even when he dropped off the entrees, he didn't say a word. If you're in a nice establishment, you expect a certain level of service and we just didn't get it. \n\nOur entrees were cleared and while we were waiting for dessert, the chef came by. I guess he heard about our wait and our conversation because  he apologized for it. He acknowledged that it's not only the food but the service that makes for a memorable dining experience. I really appreciated the apology and wish the server would have done something as well. If it was a mistake in the kitchen like the chef indicated, the server could have said so. \n\nWhen we got our desserts, he included an extra one which was; Nuage de Noix Roasted Pistachios, Almonds & Hazelnuts in a Frozen Chantilly & Italian Meringue. I had a candle on my cake too to celebrate our anniversary. It was a nice touch but maybe a little too late. \n\nBy that time we had been there for over 2 hours. We just wanted to finish eating and go home. \n\nWe just thought it was over hyped and maybe our experience wasn't the norm but it was enough for us to think about not going back which is sad because I should have tried the mussels.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-11-29"}, {"excerpts": ["For our desserts, we shared the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake and Nuage de Noix, both of which were excellent!

The interior is beautiful, seating comfortable. However, the bench tables were a bit cramped together. \n\nService: \n\nWe had an excellent waiter, complete with a french accent! The waitstaff was very attentive and they catered to all of our (limited) needs. But I am sure if we were needy, there would be no problems at all! We did, however have to move to another table because a bigger party came in suddenly, but the hostess was very apologetic and the rest of the night went without a hitch. \n\nWe had the opportunity to meet and speak with the chef, who was extremely gracious, and he sent out a few tasty extras to us at no charge! It was awesome seeing him interact with customers, sharing wine and etc. \n\nFood (The Important stuff!): \n\nI LOVE French food, so I had high expectations. We both opted for the 3 course Prix Fixe. We started with couple of appetizers, the seared Foie Gras and Veal Sweetbreads. Both were delicious! The best Foie Gras I have had so far in the city. The same went for the sweetbreads. Very savory food! We were given a 3rd appetizer, the salmon chilled stuffed salmon. Honestly, it was good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nFor our entrees, she had the Filet Mignon and I had Sea Bass. The entrees were great, but we both agreed the appetizers more or less made the experience.\n\nFor our desserts, we shared the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake and Nuage de Noix, both of which were excellent! And again, the Chef surprised us with the equally excellent Profiteroles!\n\nOverall: \n\nIt was definitely an excellent dinner, and we will definitely come back. It is not pretentious, and a very relaxed setting for a romantic dinner! I highly recommend coming here.

We eat out a lot and my husband will normally write positive reviews and save negatives for our own conversation.  However, I feel that the inconsistencies we experienced at this restaurant needed to be shared because of the type of restaurant and  the prices being charged.\n\nHere is our experience for Mother's Day: (take it with a grain of salt since it is one of the busiest days of the year)\n\nWe walked into Chapeau right in front of another party of 4 (there were 3 in our party) and we all barely fit into their tight curtained off entry. (it was like being piled onto the 38 Geary bus)...  We shuffled into the restaurant to give the other party some room and just stood there in view of the entire restaurant while we waited to be seated.\n\nThe hostess/manager/waitress (she played all 3 during our stay in her tight white jeans and flip flops) showed us to a table that was obviously just an extra stuffed into the others to accommodate the Mother's Day crowd (we watched at least one other party refuse to be seated there until it was finally just removed).  It looked right onto their reservation/billing computer, back room, chipped wall paint,  and several discarded and unused ice buckets.  I indicated that the table wouldn't be suitable (it was mother's day and I wanted mom to feel special) so we were moved to an equally \"stuffed in\" table right in the pathway of the kitchen/bar that we moved back a bit so that I would not be pummeled and bruised with each passing waiter on their way to serve other diners.  At least this table over looked some of the restaurant... or was that a good thing?  Not necessarily...  (the walls were dirty with chipped paint everywhere and absolutely no art work or any kind of decor to be seen) As we were seated (our butts not quite in the chairs) we were immediately asked... \"something to drink\" to which we had to ask for a minute to consult the menu.  After being seated and moving the table, we were promptly told in a very stern voice that we could not move it because the other diners would not have enough room.. We had to compromise by moving the table just a tad so that their wait staff had enough room. (my small purse had been knocked off my chair twice during this process while waiters passed) This earned us an audible groan and eye roll from the hostess/manager/waitress.  I know she was upset  because it then took another half an hour and my husband's request to get someone back to take that original drink order.  During this time, we considered whether or not we should stay, and since it was Mother's Day, stuck it out and we were glad we did... The food was amazing and the service did get better.\n\nWe had the mussels and sweet breads and both were sublime.  My husband had the pork tenderloin that was obviously brined because it was so tender the juices just ran with each cut... just lovely with the slight bitterness of the kale and creamy parsnip puree.  My Mother-in-Law had the Skate, which had a butter/mustard sauce that went perfect with the green/fingerling potato salad.  I had the Cassoulet de Toulouse that was cooked to perfection.  Everything was moist and the beans still had a bit of firmness and no mush... very filling and good for at least one more meal.  For dessert we shared the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake with the rum raisin ice cream..We wanted to lick the plate.\n\nI would say that if you can ignore the less than charming ambience you may expect for $30.00 French entrees, it is worth it for the food.
