As much as I love this restaurant, when operated by the former owners, I really believe the new owners have tweaked some dishes, making them just as good or better. And added some new dishes and appetizers on the menu.\n\nMy niece and I went mostly for appetizers (tapas).

They no longer have a guitar player in the front window area, like they used to on Friday and Saturday nights. Would be nice to have. The waiter/server was very friendly and helpful.  We ate lunch when they opened. I know dinner must get crowded.\n\nEl Nuevo Fruitilandia is an even more special place to dine for me. If you want to try Puerto Rican-Cuban cuisine, El Nuevo Fruitilandia stands out! I give them a high-5 rating! They compete well with all the new restaurants on lower 24th St (Calle 24/Veinticuatro). I think they surpass a lot of the newer trendy places. And it still has the flavor of the Mission heritage. El Nuevo Fruitilandia has been there longer than folks know.

This place is probably the first hidden treasure I found when moving to the Mission a few years ago. My father lived in Puerto Rico and has always grumbled about the lack of Puerto Rican food in the bay area. So when he requested Carne Guisada (a slow cooked pork stew) for his birthday dinner, I thought, \"hey, I'm in the Mission, I can figure this out.\" We were not dissapointed. El Nuevo Fruitlandia is now a family staple.\n\nTheres a whole list of fried goodness for appetizers: the tostones (smooshed and fried slices of platano) are my favorite, although I wish they had some homemade salsa and not just tapatio. They bring you warm toasted water bread while you're waiting, too, which my sister adores. \n\nYou can tell they've made an effort to cater to vegetarians, which I really appreciate. The chile rellenos (about $7) are the best I've had, in a rich tomato and chile sauce with bell pepers and onions. The mofongo (smashed fried yucca)we get the vegetarian) is also very good, if a bit greasy. The platanos maduros (sweet) are reminiscent of fried bananas but somehow savory and delicious with lots of hot sauce and the white rice and black beans that come with every entree. Yucca con mojo is always perfectly cooked, creamy and so tasty with the lemon they give you squeezed on top. We usually order the salad, too, which is simple but fresh and good, with cucumbers, corn, onions and romaine.\n\nThey also have lots of juices and shakes. I like the juices, but last time I got the shake and it tasted like frothy milk and sugar -- I could barely taste the fruit at all, which was weird. \n\nThe service is very slow but that's because they make everything fresh right when you order it.\n\nThis is one of those unique little gems that reminds me how damn lucky I am to live in San Francisco.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-06-18"}], "tostones con mojo de ajo": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered quite a bit as we wwere starving: Pastel Puertorriquenos, Platanos Maduros, Alcapurria, Tostones con Mojo de Ajo, Cubano sandwich, Passion fruit shake, and sweet potato fries.

That's great news in a city seriously bereft of it. There's Paladar on Kearny, but they don't serve hot food after 3PM. There's Chan Chan west of the Castro - which I've never tried - but am a bit wary because of their constant Groupon deals. There was Charanga in the Mission and Laurel's in Hayes Valley, but both quietly closed. I didn't realize I missed them until they were gone. Gee, I sound like Joni Mitchell. Cuban, when done wrong, can get pretty greasy, a calorific nightmare, but when done right, I've liked it a lot like at the late, lamented Charanga.\n\nMaybe Cuban food is too rarefied to catch on here, but owners Rafael and Tyrisha Frias and their chef Gary Millar are certainly putting their best foot forward in this space. From my recent solo dining experience there, the results are promising. I started with a house specialty, the $4.50 small bowl of Chicken Soup (Sopa de Pollo) which was definitely chock full of vegetables, a bit disintegrated from probably being in the pot for a while. There was also a tad too much oil in the broth since I noticed bubbles, but the soup was hot and flavorful with plenty of shards of chicken to satisfy and pepper sauce on the side for an optional extra kick (see photo). For my entree, I happened to be there on a Wednesday, so I took advantage of the daily special, the $12.25 Arroz con Pollo.\n\nThat was a nice plate of chicken pieces cooked with sauteed peppers and onions, and lots of spices. The saffron rice, which I assumed was cooked with the chicken, was especially delicious when mixed with the black beans (see photo). Satisfying home cooking for sure, although I was hoping the chicken parts were a bit bigger than they were, just my preference. It's a nice casual place, sadly not that busy, and the owners are quite friendly. Rafael is from Mexico, but he, his wife and Millar appear to have a sure hand in preparing and presenting these dishes. The $5 Yelp deal was definitely a good move, though they may want to up the amount like Arabian Nights does if they want to bring in more new business.

I don't personally like watery beans, but I found this sauce to be just thick enough on its own and was especially good with the addition of rice, which I mixed in to all the sauces we were served.

Some one in the kitchen was making MAGIC!  The sauce for the chicken dish was so good.  Good is not a strong enough word.  This dish was not spicy.  It was not chili hot.  But it was real down home comfort food.  Lots of chunks of chicken with a  side of white rice and a cup of black beans.   The Chile Rellenos was a work of art.  Perfect in every way.  We have found another favorite restaurant.  \nThe place is small.  But even on a Saturday night, we managed to get a table right away without a reservation.  It's old, we were told they have been there for 40 years.  But that's was so much of the charm.  I love these \"hole in the wall\" places that put the fancy schmancy restaurants to shame!\nDon't dine in if you're in a hurry.

This place is probably the first hidden treasure I found when moving to the Mission a few years ago.

So when he requested Carne Guisada (a slow cooked pork stew) for his birthday dinner, I thought, \"hey, I'm in the Mission, I can figure this out.\" We were not dissapointed. El Nuevo Fruitlandia is now a family staple.\n\nTheres a whole list of fried goodness for appetizers: the tostones (smooshed and fried slices of platano) are my favorite, although I wish they had some homemade salsa and not just tapatio. They bring you warm toasted water bread while you're waiting, too, which my sister adores. \n\nYou can tell they've made an effort to cater to vegetarians, which I really appreciate. The chile rellenos (about $7) are the best I've had, in a rich tomato and chile sauce with bell pepers and onions. The mofongo (smashed fried yucca)we get the vegetarian) is also very good, if a bit greasy. The platanos maduros (sweet) are reminiscent of fried bananas but somehow savory and delicious with lots of hot sauce and the white rice and black beans that come with every entree. Yucca con mojo is always perfectly cooked, creamy and so tasty with the lemon they give you squeezed on top. We usually order the salad, too, which is simple but fresh and good, with cucumbers, corn, onions and romaine.\n\nThey also have lots of juices and shakes. I like the juices, but last time I got the shake and it tasted like frothy milk and sugar -- I could barely taste the fruit at all, which was weird. \n\nThe service is very slow but that's because they make everything fresh right when you order it.\n\nThis is one of those unique little gems that reminds me how damn lucky I am to live in San Francisco.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-06-18"}, {"excerpts": ["This came with side of white rice and black beans (Cuban frijoles) and some bread.

Also, on the menu it should say that the pink beans have pork in it because friend of mine almost ate it and she is vegetarian. She discovered this after a bite and could taste the pork. At least the server should have informed us but they were fairly busy when we got there so I guess some important details were missed. Life goes on. I would go back but not during the weekend or at least during a time that they're not so busy. I am Puerto Rican so I know what this food should taste like, so I think there's definitely room for improvement.

I think it was the first time that I've had one and I must say that it was delicious\n\nOur entrees consisted of the Pollo A La Espenola which was nice cubes of chicken breast saut\u00e9ed in onions and red bell peppers in a butternut carrot spiced sauce. The sauce was both sweet and tangy very delicious actually.  The entr\u00e9e was topped off with a portion of rice. My partner ordered the Ropa Vieja which was marinated shredded beef in a tomato based sauce with rice and black beans. The sauce was very tasty and was totally different than the sauce that my dish had.  Like in all the great regional cuisines such as New Orleans it has been my experience that the sauces really make the dish and at El Nuevo Frutilandia it is all about the sauce.\n\nOur dinner was topped off with a wonderful freshly baked plantain tart which melted in our mouths. \n\nSan Francisco is a fabulous culinary destination full of multi ethnic cuisines  El Nuevo Frutilandia is a fine example of that - offering up great food, at reasonable prices in a neighborhood rich in fantastic dining alternatives.

With each bite of my sandwich I taste more bread and lettuce than any meat.  Where is all the savory meat? Did they run out of this also? I decide to take inventory, so I open my sandwich to reveal less than six strips of steak meat (see pic). and for over $10. Verdict: F-\n\nThe second entree (mofongo vegetariano) eventually arrives and that also is not met with satisfaction-- not much flavor, small portions.  \n\nBut a huge plus is in order for the house made sangria (white wine) which I was looking forward to (1st star).

They no longer have a guitar player in the front window area, like they used to on Friday and Saturday nights. Would be nice to have. The waiter/server was very friendly and helpful.  We ate lunch when they opened. I know dinner must get crowded.\n\nEl Nuevo Fruitilandia is an even more special place to dine for me. If you want to try Puerto Rican-Cuban cuisine, El Nuevo Fruitilandia stands out! I give them a high-5 rating! They compete well with all the new restaurants on lower 24th St (Calle 24/Veinticuatro). I think they surpass a lot of the newer trendy places. And it still has the flavor of the Mission heritage. El Nuevo Fruitilandia has been there longer than folks know. And I hope it will be there for many more years!\n\nI showed my Yelp! coupon on my smartphone and got the discount. That paid for an appetizer+.

Disappointed is a strong word. Perhaps too strong for the food in this case. Underwhelmed might be more appropriate. However, disappointed is probably not a strong enough descriptor of the service. \n\nI arrived about 30 minutes before my wife and ordered a beer while I waited. Knowing that she would be starving when she got there, I also ordered one alcapurria and some maduros. When my wife arrived, I had finished my beer and the waittress came over. We ordered another beer, a water for my wife, and she commented that the apps would be right out. 10 minutes later when she finally came to get our food order, none of those three things had come out yet. She said they would be right out. 10 minutes later, my beer came. My wife asked again for her water. 10 minutes later, still no water and no apps. We asked again and finally got the water. Eventually the apps came as well, but by that time it had been almost an hour since I ordered them and they were really no longer necessary. No apology or even acknowledgement of the wait. I cook maduros all the time at home. They take 5 minutes; cut and fry, it's really that simple. \n\nUnfortunately, the maduros were not very good either. They were really dry and not greasy or juicy at all like they are usually served, negative stars for the wait and disappointing presentation. The alcapurria was alright, but lacked a bit of flavor, 3 stars. I also ordered a pastel, which I had gotten to go before, so I knew not to expect much, meh, 2.5 stars. I got the mofongo, which was alright, but nothing compared to the version at Parada 22, another 2.5 stars. The wifey got the special of the day, fricase de pollo. This dish was alright, 3 stars is fair. I make a better version, in both of our opinions, but it had decent flavor. \n\nThe services just really killed it. It literally took an hour to get the apps. The waittress must have been newish. She seemed very uncomfortable with the names of the dishes on the menu, not to mention the Spanish pronunciations, always referring to them by their English descriptions (e.g., \"oh, so you want the sweet plantains?\"). She seemed confused a lot and, for some reason, was struggling despite there being three servers and only 5 small tables. \n\nWe will not be back for dinner.

This place is probably the first hidden treasure I found when moving to the Mission a few years ago.

So when he requested Carne Guisada (a slow cooked pork stew) for his birthday dinner, I thought, \"hey, I'm in the Mission, I can figure this out.\" We were not dissapointed. El Nuevo Fruitlandia is now a family staple.\n\nTheres a whole list of fried goodness for appetizers: the tostones (smooshed and fried slices of platano) are my favorite, although I wish they had some homemade salsa and not just tapatio. They bring you warm toasted water bread while you're waiting, too, which my sister adores. \n\nYou can tell they've made an effort to cater to vegetarians, which I really appreciate. The chile rellenos (about $7) are the best I've had, in a rich tomato and chile sauce with bell pepers and onions. The mofongo (smashed fried yucca)we get the vegetarian) is also very good, if a bit greasy. The platanos maduros (sweet) are reminiscent of fried bananas but somehow savory and delicious with lots of hot sauce and the white rice and black beans that come with every entree. Yucca con mojo is always perfectly cooked, creamy and so tasty with the lemon they give you squeezed on top. We usually order the salad, too, which is simple but fresh and good, with cucumbers, corn, onions and romaine.\n\nThey also have lots of juices and shakes. I like the juices, but last time I got the shake and it tasted like frothy milk and sugar -- I could barely taste the fruit at all, which was weird. \n\nThe service is very slow but that's because they make everything fresh right when you order it.\n\nThis is one of those unique little gems that reminds me how damn lucky I am to live in San Francisco.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-06-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Vegetarian mofongo!

After an hour about half of the tables were filled, all with what appeared to be local Mission folks, including a charming elderly couple, which I took as a good sign of authentic food.  On this day, service seemed casual as opposed to slow (as other reviewers have reported), but I could see it perhaps slowing down if it was too full or if too many people arrived at once.\n\nFood-wise, everything we ordered was delicious, including the each-piece-separately-toasted French table bread.  I ordered the Pastel app. on Yelp's recommendation, which I enjoyed quite a bit but wished was more tamale-like for my personal taste.  The Al Capurria was like a yummy meat-filled yucca donut which I'd definitely order again.  The complimentary chicken soup was as good as I'd want a chicken soup to be, properly salted and with very soft, moist chunks o'chicken.\n\nFor entrees we had Ropa Vieja (which my parter swore was properly cooked and had an authentic flavor), and Camarones al Ajillo, seven perfectly cooked shrimp in an amazing lemon-butter sauce.  We also tried the Chiles Rellenos just for the sake of comparison, and although they were much wetter than I expected or have had before (served in a casserole dish filled with sauce), they tasted great.  The breading was of course not crispy due to all the sauce, but it was still discernible and added to the flavor and texture of the peppers.  \n\nRegarding the side of beans which others have reviewed as \"watery and bland,\" my partner says the thinner sauce is the authentic Puerto Rican style.  I don't personally like watery beans, but I found this sauce to be just thick enough on its own and was especially good with the addition of rice, which I mixed in to all the sauces we were served. I felt the beans were \"delicately spiced\" rather than bland, meant to be a basic accompaniment, not a main flavor feature.\n\nSome reviews on here have negatively critiqued the decor, though I found it to be basic but charming, likening it to a restaurant you'd find along the road while traveling in the Island countryside.  It at least appeared to be very clean.

Ok here come to complaints...  The alcapurria, the \"dough\" tasted unbalance, meaning they used too much of one ingredient (in this case the baby green bananas) and it was overpowering....  They were also oily.  The pastel was ok, certainly lacking the usual kick of flavor I am used to.  Tostones were ok, I make better.  Amarillos are impossible to screw up so these were good.  I have never been a fan of frijoles but these were bland.  The camarones were ok... although the criolla sauce was bleh at best.  Ropa vieja was again ok, nothing to bring me back.  The mamey and pineapple shakes we got were yum though.  Too bad they didn't have guava....  All of thise for around $45.\n\nI might come back and try to aim for when they are busier to see if then the quality of the food improves even if the service is slower as some reviews mention.
