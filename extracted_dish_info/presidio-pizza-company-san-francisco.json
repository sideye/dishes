Tony's Pizza Napoletana, Pizzetta 211, Zero Zero, Little Star, Beretta...all are awesome spots.  However, I have to admit that before Presidio Pizza Company, I didn't have a go-to spot for a tasty, NY-style slice!\n\nAs soon as I walked in, I just about fell in love.  The place has a cozy, neighborhood vibe, a highly personable staff, and a giant pizza paddle on their wall that I kind of wish hung on mine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#YuRHMOBqcHMgrSirbAn8YA).  Plus, even though they're modest in size, PPC has enough tables to seat parties large or small (there's also a standing counter section for those just grabbing a slice).  Oh, and did I mention they have a menu full of delicious appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and calzones?\n\n**NOTE: the crusts have been pretty consistent every time - thin and slightly chewy yet thick enough to not get soggy.  Also, the prices listed are for whole pies, not what we paid.\n\n-- CHOPPED ROMAINE SALAD with Bacon, Provolone, Hardboiled Eggs, Cherry Tomatoes, and Avocado Vinaigrette...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#JE1aOupgsX6Nvyex5gHydg)\nSo good!  It might seem pricey for a starter salad, but the portion size isn't that of a starter.  I wouldn't have guessed that the vinaigrette was avocado (it was orange-ish), but it was tasty.  Of course, all that bacon and provolone didn't hurt either!\n\n-- HERBED GARLIC KNOTS (5 Pieces)...$5\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#JDae19psxy9OVOJLkyuq3A)\nKind of a twist (knot, if you will...) on garlic bread sticks.  The center was a little chewy/bready, but the garlic level was spot on.  The flavor wasn't overly harsh or intense, but it was more than just \"garlic\" for posterity's sake.\n\n-- PEPPERONI...$20\n-- BIANCA - Ricotta, Grana Padano, Calabro Mozzarella, Garlic, Fresh Oregano, Pesto...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#Dab5znepBSwEj7RY38UXfQ)\nThe flavor was standard, but they sure piled on the pepperonis!  As for the Bianca, it was great!  I favor pestos and white pizzas over red sauces, so this was right up my alley.  The ricotta made it a little heavy, but I liked the creaminess it added.\n\n-- WIDOWMAKER - Salami, Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Meatball, Grane Mozzarella...$26\n-- DIVIS & PIE - Grilled Chicken, Pesto, Cherry Tomato, Artichoke, Fiore de Latte Mozzarella...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#UxysoVSBGyk9wcw-S00i4w)\nAs the name suggests, the Widowmaker isn't their healthiest option, but it sure is tasty.  Of the bunch, the meatballs were the best - hefty and very flavorful.  The Divis & Pie, on the other hand, had a comparatively light mix of flavors that I liked.  However, there might have been a little too much of the artichokes and tomatoes.\n\n-- FRANKIE'S - Sausage, Rapini, Garlic, Onions, Cherry Peppers, Grande Mozzarella...$22\n-- MORGAN - Mushroom, Onion, Bell Pepper, Eggplant, Cherry Tomato, Grande Mozzarella...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#lT0dTEUJopQhv3W2Ss-lcQ)\nFor me, of the ones I tried, the Frankie's might have had the best balance of flavors.  It's a little savory (sausage), a little sweet (onions), and a little bitter (rapini)...yum!  The Morgan, however, is my least favorite.  It didn't taste bad, and I don't have a problem with veggie pizzas, but the flavors weren't super unique.\n\nTo top it all off, it's awesome that PPC is open until 2:30am on Friday and Saturday nights.  Super handy for when those late night hunger pangs hit.  If not for the Morgan and, to a lesser degree, the Divis & Pie, I just might have rounded up from FOUR AND A HALF STARS.

A little soggy along one side, the thicker Sicilian slice with meatballs ($4) was slightly undercooked.\n\nAs is typical with newly opened restaurants, Presidio Pizza Company is still working out kinks in its service.

"], "author": "Rachel L.", "review": "Oh Presidio Pizza Company how you have taken a lovely Sunday evening and broken hearts, inspired intense hanger and frustration, and crushed pizza desires.\n\nCame in last night craving pizza and wanting to try out a new neighborhood spot with good reviews to round out a big birthday weekend.  Ordered the garlic knots and a pizza (which apparently only comes in size large btw.. how hard is it to make a smaller size people??) half Frankies, half Bianca. We even specifically asked if doing half and half was possibly and were assured it was. Perfect. Both parties, even with very different preferences in pizza, satisfied.\n\n10 minutes after ordering we see our garlic knots come out and placed on a counter outside of the kitchen. Yay-we had food on the way! 5 minutes later.. they are still sitting on that counter, yet to have been delivered/acknowledged/eyed by anyone except our hangry selves. 10 minutes later.. the one waiter in the place finally notices them and brings them over. While glad they have finally been acknowledged, we are clearly not happy to receive 10 minutes out of the oven neglected garlic knots, but give them a chance anyway. Cold. Duh. My boyfriend takes them back to the counter, because at this rate it would have taken another 10 minutes to get any attention from the busy solo waiter and he agrees to have them reheated. About 7 more minutes pass and we finally receive our reheated garlic knots. Nothing special, but definitely better now that they're not cold and rock solid. Still, I would not waste the $/calories on these ever again.\n\nAnd then for the real kicker.. our pizza comes out all one flavor. A large (which we would never have ordered in the first place had it not been the only option as we're only 2 people) all Frankie's pizza, after specifically asking for half Frankies, half Bianca. This MAYBE would have been more acceptable had they been similar pizzas- but one is tomato sauce with sausage and the other is pesto + vegetarian! Aka: hangry allergic-to-tomatoes me, was left without dinner. The waiter apologized and offered to just heat up slices of the Bianca that we were missing. Although nice that there was a solution, this was certainly not what we had in mind when we ordered a baked to order pizza. When the slices came out, not only did they taste stale (not surprising as they'd been sitting on the counter for who knows how long), they were still cold with big blocks of unmelted cheese. And this is what we get because THEY forgot to make us the correct pizza.. Even the baked to order Frankies pizza was just average. Good crust but toppings were meh and now we have a whole size large of it.\n\nAt this point we were completely fed up and asked for the bill. The waiter, who was perfectly nice (but isn't this the base expectation of a server?) took the garlic knots off our order. While this was a kind gesture, it didn't make up for the fact that literally every aspect of our meal was incorrectly prepared. And to boot, didn't even taste great once it finally made it our way. Oh and, only size large pizzas? Really? While we were wasting time waiting for cold garlic knots and the wrong pizza, we saw several SMALL pizzas taken to other tables. So glad we have now paid for a large pizza we don't even want!\n\nSo an hour of disappointment and hanger later, we will certainly not be returning to Presidio Pizza Company.

It's the real deal -- the owner Frankie is from Brooklyn and knows his pizza . He uses all the correct brands of NY ingredients and uses them perfectly. And the pie is a reasonable price -- $3/slice, $18 for a whole large pie -- it looked to me like 18\" in diameter at least. I talked to Frankie, Norty (perfect East Coast name), and Josh, who make the pies, and they are very friendly, down-to-earth, easy-to-talk to guys. \n\nThey have other styles of pizza -- I tried the Grandma style (a Long-Island favorite that is a square slice with sauce, fresh mozarella and basil), and it was great. Didn't get to try the Sicilian slice.\n\nIf like me, you are tired of all of the all-hat, no-cattle pizzerias in SF that talk about what stonemason from the hills of Puglia made the bricks for their oven but produce lousy pizza, then this is your antidote. Presidio Pizza makes great pizza and if you make great pizza, no one needs to know or cares what oven you used.\n\nIf you are tired of Neapolitan pizzas that are fired at 900 degrees and come out gummy on the inside because the people making them don't have the skills to do it right (which is pretty much most of the Neapolitan pizza in SF), then Presidio Pizza is your antidote. \n\nIf you are tired of spending $20 on a 12\" pizza that has no taste, then Presidio Pizza is your antidote, You can get an amazing pizza that is 2 1/4 times the size for $2 less! (For those interested in pizza math, since the area of a circle is pi * r**2, a 12\" pie is 113 square inches, while an 18\" pie is 254 sq. in).\n\nBesides pizza, they also have meatball and chicken parm heros, salads, calzone, a great roasted-vegetable antipasto, and many other dishes. Dessert includes a Nutella pizza and cannoli.\n\nThe environment for eating in is very nice and relazing.\n\nKudos to Frankie and gang for creating a pizza place that provides a slice of NY pizza in a friendly, unpretentious way.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-01-08"}], "glutenfree brownie": [], "molten chocolate cake": []}
