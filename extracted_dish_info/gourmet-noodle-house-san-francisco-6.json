Shanghai style food. \n\nTried three dishes tonight:\n\n1) spicy five spice soup noodle. The noodles were tender but still toothsome. Really nice actually. The soup was similar to hot and sour soup; just spicy enough but not numbingly so. There was a a bit of pork, bamboo and black woods ear in the soup, also similar to hot and sour soup. Good option.\n\n2) combo Shanghai chow mein. Most restaurants call this dish Shanghai style thick noodle. The noodle was thick but not super thick. There were chunks of shrimp, chicken, pork and beef. Some cabbage and spinach also. Nice flavor and the balance of tastes was really good. \n\n3) chicken and corn dumpling. This was just OK. I have a suspicion they probably purchase these from one of the dumpling producers in the Richmond. It was ok, not outstanding.\n\nOverall a nice little noodle place, the prices are pretty reasonable. Bill for the above was $27.

It's not a very cozy restaurant so heat and hot tea made the experience better. The service was good and they were friendly and the servers spoke both Mandarin and Cantonese. The dishes came out fast and fresh. We liked reading over their menu because it had a few dishes we don't typically see on menus of other Shanghai restaurants such as Marinated Egg, Soybean in Wine Sauce, Eel Noodle Soup and Smoked Fish but we weren't in the mood to try something new today. We went with the usuals: Shanghai Steamed Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Chive, Shrimp & Pork Dumplings, Spicy Wonton, Ji Vegetable & Pork Rice Cake (new to us), and Garlic Spinach. The Xiao Long Bao and dumplings were really good. We liked the tasty broth in the Xiao Long Bao and there were big pieces of shrimp in the dumplings. We didn't care for the spicy wonton though. The peanut sauce on the wonton was bland and not spicy. The rice cakes were different than the regular Shanghai style ones because the vegetable was something we hadn't had before and we really liked the flavor. We loved the Sesame Pancake stuffed with green onions. They have dessert options too so we tried the Black Glutinous Rice Pudding. It's not pudding but is a sticky black rice dish stuffed with red bean paste. I've never had or seen anything like it before and it was ok. I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad.
