We arrived at the restaurant at 9:33pm, knowing that it closes at 10pm. We were desperate to find a place that was opened on a Saturday night since my two friends didn't have dinner yet. Our originally plan was to go to 8 Immortals but it closed at 930, so we opted for this place. It wasn't exactly the best looking restaurant from the outside, but the inside was decent. The decor is old-fashioned with minimal decor hung on the walls. It also has a television at one end of the wall.\n\nSo as we walked through the door, the waitress greeted us with a hello, quickly setted our table with tableware, and gave us the menu to look over. She paced back and forth which made me nervous although I wasn't going to order anything. She even came to our table TWICE to ask if we were ready to order - all within three minutes or so. However, she was really polite and told us to take our time. (It was understandable since they were already getting ready to close the restaurant down for the night.) After some quick deliberation (clearly under the pressure), my two friends settled on Seafood & Pineapple w/ Egg White Fried Rice and Sauteed Mixed Fresh Vegetables with rice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hbDkXsC4_ZOt5h04hmPReQ?userid=NLgTfZz_ITzmV6KiO-mGIg Both dishes were around $7.\n\nThe portions were huge! Each dish was able to feed at least two people. However, the food was unable to be finished within the fifteen minute time frame that we had left in the restaurant, so we asked for the food to be boxed. The waitress nicely boxed it up for my two friends with a smile on her face. I checked my cell phone, and it read: 10:09pm. We paid and said \"thank you\" multiple times. The waitress thanked us in return and wished us a happy new year.\n\nFriendly staff, quick service, and decent prices for big portions.
