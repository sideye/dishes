As we walked closer, we noticed the steam warming up the restaurant from all of the BBQ cooking. We also liked how each table had its own paper towel roll, as it can get pretty messy when we eat BBQ! We thought long and hard and ended up ordering some mac 'n' cheese, potato salad, a cornbread muffin, 1/2 pound of brisket, and some pork. \n\nThe mac 'n' cheese was very cheesy, much more so than I am used too! Nonetheless, I appreciated all the cheddar cheese that was drowning the pasta. The pasta was a good balance between firm and soft, making this some great mac 'n' cheese! \n\nThe potato salad was also tasty! I appreciated how there were large chunks of red potato lodged into the potato salad. Furthermore it looked like Memphis Minnie's put in the effort to really make this potato salad worth our money - the scoop is almost overflowing out of the bowl! \n\nThe cornbread muffin tasted pretty average compared to the rest of the sides. I think it would have tasted good if I had this first or by itself, but compared to the first two sides, it didn't impress me as much. Still, I did like how the sides were crispy, but the inside was very soft. \n\nThe brisket was savory, but it didn't have as much fat as most brisket does - which can be either a good or bad thing for you, depending on what you're looking for. Because of that, it also wasn't dripping in its own juices as well. Nonetheless, I liked how the slices were easy to cut and the pieces were quite large. \n\nThe pork was somewhat dry for some of its pieces, which was something I didn't like about it. However, it still tasted pretty savory as well. Even though it was dry, it wasn't tough; it was still easy to cut and wasn't too chewy. Still, I am glad we ordered the pork. \n\nI'm so glad I was able to try out Memphis Minnie's before leaving San Francisco! It definitely made me feel a bit nostalgic, as someone who has lived in the South before recently moving.

The first place i tried, Uncle Frank's in Mountain View, remains my favorite, but this place is definitely seconds (haven't tried Bo's yet).\n\nMy GF and i were planning on going to Bo's last friday night but she got home late and there was no way we were going to make the hour long drive and get there before they closed. With my heart set on having BBQ i remembered reading about Memphis Minnie's and looked them up. They're open till 10, so we hopped in the car and headed up to the City. \n\nThe place was much smaller than i was expecting. Its also pretty kitschy. It doesn't feel like the best texas BBQ joints which are usually out in the middle of nowhere and involve a large woman who calls everyone 'baby', large slabs of meat served on butcher paper (no plates), and a roll of paper towels at ever table. This place feels like it would fit in pretty well in Austin though. And the t-shirts and other memorabilia from some of my favorite BBQ joints back home indicate that they know their history.\n\nSo how was the food?\n\nWe started with the rib appetizer. The ribs were okay, but certainly not the best i've had. They were a little dry (i like wet ribs) and weren't quite fall-off-the-bone tender. Luckily they have 3 sauces to help the dry ribs problem.\n\nAh yes, the three sauces. They do a vinegar based Carolina sauce that was good, but i can't really compare it because i haven't had authentic Carolina vinegar sauce. Next up is the mustard based Carolina sauce that was definitely the star of this trio. Not quite authentic but delicious in its own way. Last up with the tomato based Texas sauce. It was good but a little bit off. Texas sauce is traditionally sweetened with brown sugar (or sometimes honey), not white sugar. While there was brown sugar in the ingredients listed on the bottle, it was definitely sweetened with mostly white sugar. Also, Texas sauce traditionally has much more heat than this. Throw in some crushed red pepper and you might be on to something. See Uncle Franks for a great tomato based sauce with some heat.\n\nNext up we got the pork sandwich with BBQ seasoned fries. The pork was okay but also dry. I loaded it up with the mustard based sauce and it turned out okay, but i feel like i make better BBQ pork sandwiches at home. The fries were pretty incredible though. \n\nLast up was the brisket. With mac and cheese (the GF has a thing for mac and cheese), collard greens, and a corn muffin. Holy crap, the brisket was incredible and after everything else being pretty mediocre caught me completely by surprise. Next time i come here im only getting brisket. It really needs no sauce but a touch of the Texas sauce sets things off just right. I'm pretty unusual in that i am a Texan who loves pork BBQ (thats a Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Carolina thing), but i agree with most that brisket is really the way to test a bbq place. It starts out as a tough, fatty, truly disgusting cut of meat, and anyone that can turn it into something delicious knows what they're doing. This was good brisket. The mac and cheese was good but not great. The collard greens were fantastic though. I didn't know anyone was cooking collard greens in the Bay Area. Wes was right though that the sides are ridiculously small. The cornbread muffin was also a bit dry and not sweet enough for my taste.\n\nSpeaking of bread, i know that if there is one place in this glorious country where wheat bread is giving white bread a thrashing, its right here in the Bay Area. You guys (and myself included) love that super dense 9 grain stuff that could kill someone if dropped on their head. I continue to be amazed and you guys' inability to eat white bread with BBQ. Look, i don't think i've had a sandwich on wonder bread since i was in 3rd grade. I love my wheat bread. When it comes to sandwiches for lunch, or toast for breakfast i turn end to a grouch if i get stuck with white bread. But somehow with BBQ it just works. Nothing soaks up that sauce and washing things down like a slice of wonder bread. Why is that so hard? Im not asking you to eat wonderbread all the time, just with BBQ. You can't get cancer from eating like 3 or 4 times a year. Plus you're eating BBQ, are you really going to try and monitor what you're putting into your body? Wheat bread or french baguettes just don't have the right texture. Its got to be white bread.\n\nI'm not really sure whats up with the sake and would advise people to stay away. I see how maybe the flavor contrast would work but it just feels wrong. Instead go for the sweet tea, a southern staple. Its not the best sweet tea, but its not bad for being served out here. \n\nThey make good sauces at Minnie's, but they should get over their fear of putting them on the meat.

I was a little wary because I'm not a fan of pork and was worried that MM, with a pig as its mascot and Memphis in its name, would only serve pork BBQ. But boy, was I wrong! The menu is diverse, from Andouille sausage (BBQ isn't BBQ without sausage, folks) to chicken to beef brisket to meat by the pound. You aren't allowed to sit before you order but turnover is pretty fast. I would recommend the sweet iced tea - it wasn't too watery or too sweet. I sneaked peeks and what others ordered and the amount of food you get is pretty big for the price. The Boyfriend and I shared the Taster (two or three choices of meat with two sides and a cornbread muffin) and there was no way one person, unless very large or starving, can finish all of that.

The hot sauce is located on the counter directly to the right of the register (from your perspective, not the cashier's). There are little cups in which to pour some in and take back to your seat. I liked mixing the Texas red mixed with the hot sauce. Don't be deceived! The first taste of the sauce is very bland with no kick but give it a bit and it'll hit your mouth.

On their Specials, Wednesday's is our favorite:  the Pastrami Sandwich.  I tell you, it melts in your mouth...it's so unbelievably tender.  But the single most fantastic item at Memphis Minnie's, in my eyes, is their Mustard Sauce.  At first, I wasn't even open to it...I like the traditional red BBQ sauces.  But my husband convinced me to just try it, and I was hooked!  It's just phenomenal.  Hell, I'd chug it like a beer if I could, but that would probably be a little undignified!  I will tell ya, parking is miserable.  So my husband and I do the tag-team bit and he runs in and picks up the order which we had phoned in, while I drive around the block a few times.  Then we bring our bag of deliciousness to the beach and make an afternoon or evening of it.  I've turned family and friends onto this gem and they, too, have become disciples.

While it certainly hit the spot in the meat category (not only was I still full when I woke up the next morning, I was craving salad... and I am NOT a salad person), it left something to be desired in the taste department. Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of dry rubs...\n\nWhile I know that a huge part of American BBQ is the sauces, I also feel that great BBQ shouldn't rely on sauces alone. The meat itself should be so well seasoned and marinated that it renders the sauces somewhat unnecessary. This was not the case here. I found myself squirting puddle after puddle of sauces on my plate - not because I thought they were particularly amazing (though the South Caroline mustard and Texas red sauces were pretty good), but because my taste buds were yearning for more flavour.\n\nI shared a Minnie's Taster (3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin) with a friend. We chose the Texas big BEEF RIBS, Memphis sweet SMOKED PORK, their famous Texas beef BRISKET, bbq seasoned FRIES and SWEET POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=jCvDnrUbN4E6Evg518rsQQ).

To be honest, all the meats tasted the same to me - that is, they tasted like whatever sauce I doused them with. The only difference was their textures.\n\nI actually enjoyed the sides more than I did the meats. The bbq fries were delicious but extremely greasy; the majority of them were translucent (and soggy) with oil. The sweet potatoes were good, but how can you go wrong with cubed baked sweet potatoes? I also liked the sweet and sour potlikker greens.

A bottle of \"South Carolina Mustard Sauce\" and a bottle of delectable, sweet, smokey, burn-your-mouth-Habanero-laced BBQ sauce called \"BeezleBob's Breath\", described on the label as \"Stupid Hot\". She tells me she got these sauces from a \"bomb-ass BBQ spot in the Lower Haight called Memphis Minnies\". She visited again in December and brought the \"North Carolina Vinegar Sauce\" from this fine establishment...\n\nAlthough all 3 of these sauces are outstanding, being a \"Food Pyro\" (I love spicy sh*t) I used the \"BBB\" sauce on everything. Pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken, bacon & eggs, sandwiches... I think the kicker was during Christmas, when I marinated a top sirloin roast in it. Even though that roast was one of the last entrees out of the oven, it was the first one gone... with several victims perspiring and asking for more at the same time. \n\nSo this past weekend I finally paid a visit to the source of this infamous sauce. Needless to say, the food was DELICIOUS. I had the \"taster\", where you can order your choice of 3 meats. I opted for the Brisket, Memphis sweet smoked Pork (pulled pork) and Rib tips. I initially ordered the Tri-Tip, but at the last minute changed it up to the rib tips. For my side dishes, I got the Mac & cheese and the potato salad. It also comes with a corn bread muffin. \n\nBoth the Brisket and smoked pork were ridiculously tender... the rib tips - not so much. They weren't horrible, but lets just say I should've stuck with the Tri-Tip. My wife found a new friend in their \"Texas Red sauce\", which she doused her Pulled Pork Sandwich with. (we bought a bottle to take home) The potato salad was a perfect texture, with a little tangyness to it = delicious. The mac & cheese was creamy, cheesy and mmm, mmm good! The corn bread muffin was a little on the dry side but at that point I really didn't care! \n\nOh , I forgot to tell you that we ordered their \"Chili-cheese & Brisket Fries\". WOW. That's all I can say. Just WOW... \n\nOne thing I WISH I WOULD HAVE ORDERED: The St. Louis style Pork Ribs. My son ordered them & couldn't finish his, so... what the hell, right?

I haven't had that kind of regret since I forgot my camera that time I saw Jessica Alba in a 2 piece bikini at the Kahala Mandarin Hotel... (did I just say that out loud?) Oh well... \n\nSo, with all the praise I've just given this place, you're probably asking yourself: \"Well then why did you only give them 4 stars?\" It's simple. Portion size. Since my dish was $16.95 & included 3 items, I was thinking it would be a HUGE pile smokey BBQ... eh, it was ok. 4 slices of Brisket, about 3/4 cup of pulled pork & 4 rib tips. I hate to sound like a pig but dammit, I was hungry! Then I see some guy with a plate FULL of pork ribs... so again, it's no mystery what I'm getting next time. \n\nBottom line: Eat Here.

We actually came across it as if by mistake. After being smacked in the nose by the aroma of wood smoked meat we frantically looked around wondering where the intoxicating BBQ smells were coming from.\n\nWhen you enter you find yourself transported instantly to the Deep South. The smell of barbecue is heavy in the air and there is row of tables occupied by a wide variety of patrons clearly enjoying their meals. There is a small pie case that displays some of the regional desserts, the sauces that they make, and some piggy influenced chachkis, which can be found all around the restaurant.\n\nAt first I found the menu board to be a bit complicated. I don't mean to say I didn't understand what the items on it were; I wasn't sure why some of the items were on it. I guess when I really think about it one item kept distracting me; Premium Sake. As it turns out I am not the first to point out that Sake and barbecue are an odd combination. Their official position on the sake is that there are similarities in the long standing traditions and artisanal approach to both, and besides, the Sake tastes great and so does the barbecue so together they are doubly good. Ok, I'll buy that. Some people drink red wine with fish and white wine with beef, and some people will drink Sake with barbecue.\n\nSince we just happened to end up at Memphis Minnie's and this was not a planned review I was a bit unprepared to order the variety of foods that I would for a typical menu sampling. Since I was with a couple of other people I just let them know that I would be eating off their plates for the sake of the review. They hesitantly agreed.\n\nI ordered the Minnie's Taster; three meats with a choice of two sides. On my plate will be the Texas Big Bones, the 18hour Smoked Texas Brisket, and the Memphis Sweet Smoked Pork. Accompanying those meats will be the Potlikker Greens and the Tart 'n Tangy Slaw. In addition to those I will also be sampling the St. Louis Smoked Pork Ribs. I really had my mind set on the Andouille sausage, alas there was none. In all fairness it does say \"Not All Items Are Available All The Time\" right on the menu board.\n\nI prefer to start with the sides, let's get the supporting cast out of the way so that we can get to the main event. The slaw is crispy and tangy. There are slivers of red onion and bell pepper which compliment the shredded salad. This is not your typical California creamy mayo slaw. The dressing is on this is vinegar based and has a distinct twang to it. There is a sweetness that follows as your taste buds snap back, but it is well balanced and not sugary.\n\nThe Potlikker Greens are prepared in a classic down south manner, with onion and vinegar and slow cooked tender greens. I found these to be quite delicious but a little sweeter than I like. I did put about half of them down before the sweetness got to me.\n\nCenter stage was a battle for the best and quite honestly I find it almost impossible to pick the best of these incredible smoked delicacies. The beef ribs are rich and dark with a zesty bark. The meat comes away from the bones cleanly and they are the most tender beef ribs I have ever experienced. Next, the pork shoulder, buttery soft and smoky with just the right amount of spices. The outside pieces are sweet and sticky from the slow cooking process. No knives are needed here. The beef brisket was juicy and tender. The flavors were mesmerizing and the texture was perfect. There was a quarter inch smoke ring on the tender beef slices. The St. Louis Ribs also came away from the bone cleanly. The outside was crusted with spices and slightly charred meat while inside; the tender pork, pink from smoke was juicy and sweet. I struggled with the idea of putting sauce on this perfectly cooked meat but the variety of sauces on the table was intriguing.\n\nOn the table were three sauces Red, Vinegar, and Mustard sauce. First the Texas Red; Bold, tangy, and sweet, the flavor of ginger and clove stood out. The North Carolina Vinegar Sauce is tangy but not sour. I think the word vinegar in the name of this sauce is a bit misleading. It is fresh and herbal and really wakes up the meat you sprinkle it on. South Carolina mustard sauce is a just little sweet and has a delicate nature. It is a perfect accompaniment for the any of the pork dishes. All of the sauces were balanced and enhanced the meats. They were delicate enough to let the meats natural flavors come through, yet bold enough to stand up to the rich smoky meats that they adorn.\n\nIn Northern California where you find barbecue restaurants with no pits, and heavily sauced meats cooked in ovens, Memphis Minnie's is a whole new world; like walking through a portal to a land where barbecue matters.

That said, in my California opinion, Memphis Minnie's is awesome. Almost every time I've gone, everything I've ordered has been good to great. And since I've gone probably 20 or 30 times I feel like I have a pretty informed opinion.\n\nIn my opinion, these are the best meats and sides:\n- St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs\n- Slow-Smoked Texas Beef Brisket\n- Potlikker Greens\n- Minnie's Macaroni & Cheese\n\nEverything else is good, but these 4 things are the best on the menu.\n\nI also love the 4 sauces they have on every table, the spicy one isn't all that spicy and the Texas one is kind of blah, but the customization is nice. My personal favorite is the North Carolina sauce that has mustard in it, although the vinegar one is also great for cutting through the fatty, rich meat.\n\nI also have a funny story about one visit. So I was with my friend, and we both ordered food and were seated and we got to talking about how he's from LA, and he happens to be someone who enjoys smoking the marijuana. Whatever, I don't judge, and it's legal-ish now anyway.\n\nSo we're talking, and this lady at the table next to us overhears us and asks how he likes SF. She's an older lady, a little frazzled looking, and he mentions that it's nice but he misses some parts of LA and also it's cold. The lady finishes before us, and before leaving says \"hold out your hands, I got something to welcome you to San Francisco\".\n\nNo joke, he cups his hands and this lady proceeds to literally fill up his hands with marijuana. I have no idea how much, but like, way more than any normal person just carries loose on them. My friend looks like a little kid on Christmas, eyes lit up, huge smile. Me being unused to seeing drugs I was just shocked.\n\nDoes the story end there? No! Apparently my friend, who I'll now start referring to as \"my idiot friend\", went home and made the marijuana into cigarettes. Which he left on a table, that apparently isn't level. So his French Bulldog somehow knocked them off and ate them all.\n\nLuckily my idiot friend's dog was fine, but he said the dog was staring at the ceiling, drooling and unresponsive, for hours.\n\nBack to the restaurant, in my mind there are only two main issues with Memphis Minnie's. First, it pains me to say so, but sometimes the meat is a bit dry. I've watched plenty of food shows that go to real Southern BBQ spots, and the meat always looks juicy. Maybe those were bad days.\n\nSecond, obviously the prices are too high. I can eat their \"Minnie's Taster\" three meat combo no problem, which in my mind means it's too small. I feel like if you go to a BBQ place and order their largest platter, it should be way too much food to finish. Memphis Minnie's isn't there, and for $20 it's too much. Either it should be like $14, or they should seriously add 1/3 more food to it.\n\nAnyway, prices and ocasional quality issues aside, I really like this place. It's unique, the interior is kitschy and fun, and it gives me a chance to eat something that is outside the normal California fair. I sadly no longer live nearby, but I have very fond memories of when I did.

While it certainly hit the spot in the meat category (not only was I still full when I woke up the next morning, I was craving salad... and I am NOT a salad person), it left something to be desired in the taste department. Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of dry rubs...\n\nWhile I know that a huge part of American BBQ is the sauces, I also feel that great BBQ shouldn't rely on sauces alone. The meat itself should be so well seasoned and marinated that it renders the sauces somewhat unnecessary. This was not the case here. I found myself squirting puddle after puddle of sauces on my plate - not because I thought they were particularly amazing (though the South Caroline mustard and Texas red sauces were pretty good), but because my taste buds were yearning for more flavour.\n\nI shared a Minnie's Taster (3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin) with a friend. We chose the Texas big BEEF RIBS, Memphis sweet SMOKED PORK, their famous Texas beef BRISKET, bbq seasoned FRIES and SWEET POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=jCvDnrUbN4E6Evg518rsQQ). My favourite was the smoked pork, followed by the tender brisket. The beef ribs were ok and I wonder if I would've liked the pork ribs more. To be honest, all the meats tasted the same to me - that is, they tasted like whatever sauce I doused them with. The only difference was their textures.\n\nI actually enjoyed the sides more than I did the meats. The bbq fries were delicious but extremely greasy; the majority of them were translucent (and soggy) with oil. The sweet potatoes were good, but how can you go wrong with cubed baked sweet potatoes? I also liked the sweet and sour potlikker greens. My favourite dish of the night, hands down, was the amazing MAC & CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=r977oww6RNTfhdFZrkJa1Q) that we ordered on the side.

The gentleman behind that counter suggested that a pound per 2-3 people is good, so I say let's do 2 pounds per person. What about sides? \"A pint for 2-3 people usually is fine. Will we be doing a pint per person?\" \"You're god damn right we will!\" I finish my order and in ten minutes everything is in a box and they include a stack of plates, napkins and utensils.\n\n\nItems Ordered:\n\nSide\nPit Smoked Beans- Beans with beef?

We actually came across it as if by mistake. After being smacked in the nose by the aroma of wood smoked meat we frantically looked around wondering where the intoxicating BBQ smells were coming from.\n\nWhen you enter you find yourself transported instantly to the Deep South. The smell of barbecue is heavy in the air and there is row of tables occupied by a wide variety of patrons clearly enjoying their meals. There is a small pie case that displays some of the regional desserts, the sauces that they make, and some piggy influenced chachkis, which can be found all around the restaurant.\n\nAt first I found the menu board to be a bit complicated. I don't mean to say I didn't understand what the items on it were; I wasn't sure why some of the items were on it. I guess when I really think about it one item kept distracting me; Premium Sake. As it turns out I am not the first to point out that Sake and barbecue are an odd combination. Their official position on the sake is that there are similarities in the long standing traditions and artisanal approach to both, and besides, the Sake tastes great and so does the barbecue so together they are doubly good. Ok, I'll buy that. Some people drink red wine with fish and white wine with beef, and some people will drink Sake with barbecue.\n\nSince we just happened to end up at Memphis Minnie's and this was not a planned review I was a bit unprepared to order the variety of foods that I would for a typical menu sampling. Since I was with a couple of other people I just let them know that I would be eating off their plates for the sake of the review. They hesitantly agreed.\n\nI ordered the Minnie's Taster; three meats with a choice of two sides. On my plate will be the Texas Big Bones, the 18hour Smoked Texas Brisket, and the Memphis Sweet Smoked Pork. Accompanying those meats will be the Potlikker Greens and the Tart 'n Tangy Slaw. In addition to those I will also be sampling the St. Louis Smoked Pork Ribs. I really had my mind set on the Andouille sausage, alas there was none. In all fairness it does say \"Not All Items Are Available All The Time\" right on the menu board.\n\nI prefer to start with the sides, let's get the supporting cast out of the way so that we can get to the main event. The slaw is crispy and tangy. There are slivers of red onion and bell pepper which compliment the shredded salad. This is not your typical California creamy mayo slaw. The dressing is on this is vinegar based and has a distinct twang to it. There is a sweetness that follows as your taste buds snap back, but it is well balanced and not sugary.\n\nThe Potlikker Greens are prepared in a classic down south manner, with onion and vinegar and slow cooked tender greens. I found these to be quite delicious but a little sweeter than I like. I did put about half of them down before the sweetness got to me.\n\nCenter stage was a battle for the best and quite honestly I find it almost impossible to pick the best of these incredible smoked delicacies. The beef ribs are rich and dark with a zesty bark. The meat comes away from the bones cleanly and they are the most tender beef ribs I have ever experienced. Next, the pork shoulder, buttery soft and smoky with just the right amount of spices. The outside pieces are sweet and sticky from the slow cooking process. No knives are needed here. The beef brisket was juicy and tender. The flavors were mesmerizing and the texture was perfect. There was a quarter inch smoke ring on the tender beef slices. The St. Louis Ribs also came away from the bone cleanly. The outside was crusted with spices and slightly charred meat while inside; the tender pork, pink from smoke was juicy and sweet. I struggled with the idea of putting sauce on this perfectly cooked meat but the variety of sauces on the table was intriguing.\n\nOn the table were three sauces Red, Vinegar, and Mustard sauce. First the Texas Red; Bold, tangy, and sweet, the flavor of ginger and clove stood out. The North Carolina Vinegar Sauce is tangy but not sour. I think the word vinegar in the name of this sauce is a bit misleading. It is fresh and herbal and really wakes up the meat you sprinkle it on. South Carolina mustard sauce is a just little sweet and has a delicate nature. It is a perfect accompaniment for the any of the pork dishes. All of the sauces were balanced and enhanced the meats. They were delicate enough to let the meats natural flavors come through, yet bold enough to stand up to the rich smoky meats that they adorn.\n\nIn Northern California where you find barbecue restaurants with no pits, and heavily sauced meats cooked in ovens, Memphis Minnie's is a whole new world; like walking through a portal to a land where barbecue matters. The meats are perfectly prepared and the sauce is optional if needed at all.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-05-15"}], "tart n tangy slaw": [{"excerpts": ["Tart n Tangy Slaw - I don't care for slaw, but the sour, cold, crunchy leaves were rather refreshing for that warm hot day.\n"], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "Am I here for BBQ or am I about to be a character in a children's storybook?

"], "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T.", "review": "Awesome barbecue food!  \nBest for 'DRY' BBQ fans; not for wet ribs.\nRibs are good, but other items make this place special.\n\nMemphis Minnie's has steadily become my favorite restaurant in San Francisco, which is kind of interesting, considering a large number of other quality restaurants in the area.  While I love all the other restaurants, I end up going to Memphis Minnie's more than any other place, credit to their quality food and fairly reasonable prices.  I've had BBQ at much cheaper prices, but cheaper alternatives do not come close to the level of Memphis Minnie's.  They really take their food seriously, and you could see that people here are serious about their work.  While the restaurant's name suggests they serve Memphis style barbecue, their menu consists of Texas and St. Louis style items.  \n\nEver since Minnie's became one of my favorite restaurants, I decided to made an effort to try everything on their menu, a goal I still haven't reached, but coming very close.  Note that not all items are available all the time.  ALL their dishes are good, but here is the ranking of my favorite items:\n\n1. Pastrami Sandwich (only available on Wednesdays) ($9)\n2. Memphis Sweet-Smoked Pork ($12)\n3. Texas Beef Brisket ($14)\n4. The Minnie's Burger ($8)\n5. Texas Big Beef Ribs ($14)\n6. St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs ($14)\n7. Tri tip steak ($14)\n8. Rib tips ($9)\n9. Smoked Sausages ($12)\n10. Smoked Turkey Breast (may need to go on Fri/Sat/Sun) ($14) \n11. Smoked Chicken Plate ($12)\n\nSides:\n1. Tart 'n Tangy Slaw\n2. Hand cut fries\n3. Mac & Cheese\n4. Beans\n5. Sweet potatoes\n6. Potato salad\n7. Greens\n\nI recommend ordering their two-way ($15) or three-way ($17) to try a variety of their dishes.\n\nI first tried this place after it was featured in the show \"Check Please --- Bay Area.\" (you can watch all their episodes online http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/2006/09/check-please-bay-area-season-2-episode.jsp)  \n\nSERVICE:  When I went around 7:00 PM on a Saturday night, the place was packed.  Seats are on first to order basis, which is fair.  I was impressed with their service in that the cashier kept track of when I got my seats and signaled to the cook to prepare the food; avoiding the food to cool down while the I still didn't have seats.\n\nSYSTEM:  This is one of those 'order, pay, and pickup your own food when they call your name' kind of place.  As you enter, cooking area is to the left and tables against the wall on the right.  Form a line along the left side along the kitchen counter where you could see the menu on the wall.  The guy taking the order was nice and informative and wasn't disturbed when I was asking questions.  He informed me that pork ribs, which I thought would be the thing to eat there, was actually the third most popular item on the menu.  People come here to eat Texas Beef Briskets (smoked 18 hours), followed by Texas beef ribs.  Pay immediately after ordering, get your drinks, and find a table.  The cook will call your name when the food is ready.\n\nFOOD:  I really loved their pastrami sandwich.  It's seasoned perfectly, so you don't need to slap on extra mustard.  It's a bit different than NYC style pastrami, but Minnie's makes it excellent in their own way.  I wish they offered it everyday, instead of just on Wednesdays.  Beef brisket, which was not tough at all, had a very tasty smoked taste even without any sauce.  All their food comes without sauce with three types of home made sauces available for use on the table.  The French fries were also very nice.  Cole slaw wasn't smothered in mayo and had this sweet vinegar taste.  \n\nTIP:  I saw the cook preparing to smoke their signature dishes, sweet pork and beef brisket, around 7 pm.  She told me they smoke it until 11 am next day and its best after resting it for about 2 hours.  Which means you might be able to eat their brisket at their peak around 1pm.  \n\nBURGER: You might wonder why someone would order a burger when their smoked items are so good, but frequent diners at Minnie's know that their burger could be the best burger in the city.  Don't look for lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, pickles, or mayo; they want you to enjoy the taste of their hand ground meat grilled to perfection.  Crispy charred outside, juicy inside, needs nothing more than grilled onions and cheese.  You could add ketchup or BBQ sauce, but you might want to first take a bite and notice existent flavors.  Toasted baguette keeps the juice inside and makes it a perfect bun for this kind of burger.  \n\nSUMMARY:  You can keep it under $10/person if you go with sandwiches or go with their platters which are around $14 + tax and drinks.  This may seem a bit on high side for lunch at a non-full service restaurant, but it's actually a good deal when you consider the quality of food you are getting.  For dinner, it's certainly a bargain.", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["At our table:  ribs ( a little too much fat ) very tasty, the fried chicken w/ mac n cheese, sweet potatoes ... great !

While it certainly hit the spot in the meat category (not only was I still full when I woke up the next morning, I was craving salad... and I am NOT a salad person), it left something to be desired in the taste department. Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of dry rubs...\n\nWhile I know that a huge part of American BBQ is the sauces, I also feel that great BBQ shouldn't rely on sauces alone. The meat itself should be so well seasoned and marinated that it renders the sauces somewhat unnecessary. This was not the case here. I found myself squirting puddle after puddle of sauces on my plate - not because I thought they were particularly amazing (though the South Caroline mustard and Texas red sauces were pretty good), but because my taste buds were yearning for more flavour.\n\nI shared a Minnie's Taster (3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin) with a friend. We chose the Texas big BEEF RIBS, Memphis sweet SMOKED PORK, their famous Texas beef BRISKET, bbq seasoned FRIES and SWEET POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=jCvDnrUbN4E6Evg518rsQQ). My favourite was the smoked pork, followed by the tender brisket. The beef ribs were ok and I wonder if I would've liked the pork ribs more. To be honest, all the meats tasted the same to me - that is, they tasted like whatever sauce I doused them with. The only difference was their textures.\n\nI actually enjoyed the sides more than I did the meats. The bbq fries were delicious but extremely greasy; the majority of them were translucent (and soggy) with oil. The sweet potatoes were good, but how can you go wrong with cubed baked sweet potatoes? I also liked the sweet and sour potlikker greens. My favourite dish of the night, hands down, was the amazing MAC & CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=r977oww6RNTfhdFZrkJa1Q) that we ordered on the side.

The salad was huge, lightly dressed, with a huge amount of chicken.  I had a corn bread muffin which was salty and buttery and delish.

In other words, it's a perfect place to pig out. \n\nMy first couple of minutes at this place were pretty awkward. Here's the conversation I had with the cashier right off the bat: \n\nMemphis Minnie's Cashier: \"Welcome! Are you still deciding? You should definitely get some of our country fried chicken.

I got four thick slices of brisket and a decent sized serving of pulled pork. Next to the meat there were two tiny cups with the sides I ordered. The sides were embarrassingly small.

I was a little wary because I'm not a fan of pork and was worried that MM, with a pig as its mascot and Memphis in its name, would only serve pork BBQ. But boy, was I wrong! The menu is diverse, from Andouille sausage (BBQ isn't BBQ without sausage, folks) to chicken to beef brisket to meat by the pound. You aren't allowed to sit before you order but turnover is pretty fast. I would recommend the sweet iced tea - it wasn't too watery or too sweet. I sneaked peeks and what others ordered and the amount of food you get is pretty big for the price. The Boyfriend and I shared the Taster (two or three choices of meat with two sides and a cornbread muffin) and there was no way one person, unless very large or starving, can finish all of that.

In fact, last time the office went out to BBQ for lunch, we went to a trendy new hipster BBQ place on Divisadero and it was not very good.

SO GOOD. You don't necessarily need the sauce, but they give you FOUR sauce options to blow your mind. For the pulled pork, I prefer the Texas Red and Carolina Mustard sauces combined. Nom nom nom nom.\n\nSmoked Pork Ribs: Really tender and not fall-off-the-bone messy. So good I sometimes even suck out the bone marrow. These could easily be eaten with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, but I do love all the sauces set up as a little dipping station for these bad boys.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese: Big macaroni noodles, big cheesy flavor and breadcrumbs. Most BBQ places skip the breadcrumbs, but they add a great texture to contrast this soft and creamy side dish. Its some next-level stuff. I love it.\n\nPotato Salad: Deliciously homemade red potato salad with a bit of red bell pepper that sends this picnic and BBQ staple to the moon. I am so glad they don't do boring sides here.\n\nBBQ Seasoned Fries: Order the $4.75 basket and seriously get enough fries to feed six people or three super drunk patrons from Molotov's which is next door. These are really great fries and I don't love fries, so they impress me every time.\n\nThe service here is pretty good, but I can see how some people might get frustrated.

While it certainly hit the spot in the meat category (not only was I still full when I woke up the next morning, I was craving salad... and I am NOT a salad person), it left something to be desired in the taste department. Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of dry rubs...\n\nWhile I know that a huge part of American BBQ is the sauces, I also feel that great BBQ shouldn't rely on sauces alone. The meat itself should be so well seasoned and marinated that it renders the sauces somewhat unnecessary. This was not the case here. I found myself squirting puddle after puddle of sauces on my plate - not because I thought they were particularly amazing (though the South Caroline mustard and Texas red sauces were pretty good), but because my taste buds were yearning for more flavour.\n\nI shared a Minnie's Taster (3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin) with a friend.

To be honest, all the meats tasted the same to me - that is, they tasted like whatever sauce I doused them with. The only difference was their textures.\n\nI actually enjoyed the sides more than I did the meats. The bbq fries were delicious but extremely greasy; the majority of them were translucent (and soggy) with oil. The sweet potatoes were good, but how can you go wrong with cubed baked sweet potatoes?

", "The pork was okay but also dry. ", "I loaded it up with the mustard based sauce and it turned out ", "okay, ", "but i feel like i make better BBQ pork sandwiches at home. "], "author": "Travis D.", "review": "Ever since i moved to the Bay Area from Texas about a year ago i have been on a steady search for a decent BBQ place for when im feeling homesick. The first place i tried, Uncle Frank's in Mountain View, remains my favorite, but this place is definitely seconds (haven't tried Bo's yet).\n\nMy GF and i were planning on going to Bo's last friday night but she got home late and there was no way we were going to make the hour long drive and get there before they closed. With my heart set on having BBQ i remembered reading about Memphis Minnie's and looked them up. They're open till 10, so we hopped in the car and headed up to the City. \n\nThe place was much smaller than i was expecting. Its also pretty kitschy. It doesn't feel like the best texas BBQ joints which are usually out in the middle of nowhere and involve a large woman who calls everyone 'baby', large slabs of meat served on butcher paper (no plates), and a roll of paper towels at ever table. This place feels like it would fit in pretty well in Austin though. And the t-shirts and other memorabilia from some of my favorite BBQ joints back home indicate that they know their history.\n\nSo how was the food?\n\nWe started with the rib appetizer. The ribs were okay, but certainly not the best i've had. They were a little dry (i like wet ribs) and weren't quite fall-off-the-bone tender. Luckily they have 3 sauces to help the dry ribs problem.\n\nAh yes, the three sauces. They do a vinegar based Carolina sauce that was good, but i can't really compare it because i haven't had authentic Carolina vinegar sauce. Next up is the mustard based Carolina sauce that was definitely the star of this trio. Not quite authentic but delicious in its own way. Last up with the tomato based Texas sauce. It was good but a little bit off. Texas sauce is traditionally sweetened with brown sugar (or sometimes honey), not white sugar. While there was brown sugar in the ingredients listed on the bottle, it was definitely sweetened with mostly white sugar. Also, Texas sauce traditionally has much more heat than this. Throw in some crushed red pepper and you might be on to something. See Uncle Franks for a great tomato based sauce with some heat.\n\nNext up we got the pork sandwich with BBQ seasoned fries. The pork was okay but also dry. I loaded it up with the mustard based sauce and it turned out okay, but i feel like i make better BBQ pork sandwiches at home. The fries were pretty incredible though. \n\nLast up was the brisket. With mac and cheese (the GF has a thing for mac and cheese), collard greens, and a corn muffin. Holy crap, the brisket was incredible and after everything else being pretty mediocre caught me completely by surprise. Next time i come here im only getting brisket. It really needs no sauce but a touch of the Texas sauce sets things off just right. I'm pretty unusual in that i am a Texan who loves pork BBQ (thats a Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Carolina thing), but i agree with most that brisket is really the way to test a bbq place. It starts out as a tough, fatty, truly disgusting cut of meat, and anyone that can turn it into something delicious knows what they're doing. This was good brisket. The mac and cheese was good but not great. The collard greens were fantastic though. I didn't know anyone was cooking collard greens in the Bay Area. Wes was right though that the sides are ridiculously small. The cornbread muffin was also a bit dry and not sweet enough for my taste.\n\nSpeaking of bread, i know that if there is one place in this glorious country where wheat bread is giving white bread a thrashing, its right here in the Bay Area. You guys (and myself included) love that super dense 9 grain stuff that could kill someone if dropped on their head. I continue to be amazed and you guys' inability to eat white bread with BBQ. Look, i don't think i've had a sandwich on wonder bread since i was in 3rd grade. I love my wheat bread. When it comes to sandwiches for lunch, or toast for breakfast i turn end to a grouch if i get stuck with white bread. But somehow with BBQ it just works. Nothing soaks up that sauce and washing things down like a slice of wonder bread. Why is that so hard? Im not asking you to eat wonderbread all the time, just with BBQ. You can't get cancer from eating like 3 or 4 times a year. Plus you're eating BBQ, are you really going to try and monitor what you're putting into your body? Wheat bread or french baguettes just don't have the right texture. Its got to be white bread.\n\nI'm not really sure whats up with the sake and would advise people to stay away. I see how maybe the flavor contrast would work but it just feels wrong. Instead go for the sweet tea, a southern staple. Its not the best sweet tea, but its not bad for being served out here. \n\nThey make good sauces at Minnie's, but they should get over their fear of putting them on the meat.

My friend and I drove all the way over from Oakland for, what we thought was going to be a special treat. I had the pulled spicy chicken sandwich which had good flavor but it was not warmed all the way through. The mac & cheese was halfway decent. The greens sucked! The corn muffin was too coarse! The sweet potatoes were tasteless. The fried peach pie wasn't very tasty and wasn't heated throughout. My friend had the rib tips and brisket. Some of the rib tips were overcooked and dry. The bbq sauce selection was just strange....I'm not even sure what to say about it. I'm glad they have the Haight street inhabitants fooled into thinking that they know anything about bbq and soulfood. I've traveled all over the country and had all types of bbq.

The unassuming joint in the Lower Haight serves up the tastiest brisket, tri-tip, ribs, and other fine BBQ treats in the city. Everything at Memphis Minnie's is slow smoked Southern style--no gas or electric here. All the meats are smoked at least 4 hours (some up to 18 hours) over white oak logs, lending it the authentic taste that Memphis Minnie's is known for. \n\nMemphis Minnie's is usually busy all day, which is a testament to how delicious it's smoked meats really are; however, the food comes out hot and fast. They are known for their Slow Cooked Texas Beef Brisket, but the menu also has an assortment of fine dishes if you aren't a fan of traditional brisket. Popular main dishes are the St. Louis Style Pork Ribs, Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak Plate, Smoked Chicken Plate, and the Two Way Combo (any two meats) for those who can't make decisions. The Smokehouse Sandwiches are also an excellent choice for lunch or dinner for those with a smaller appetite. \n\nMemphis Minnie's is plain delicious. The meats are smoked to perfection, the sides are super tasty, and they even have creative desserts like the Smoked Pecan Bacon Brittle. Yum! Next time you are looking for BBQ in the city, hit up Memphis Minnie's and you won't be disappointed.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-07-12"}]}
