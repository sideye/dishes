My point: There's just no room for an in-your-face Mariachi band. \n\nStreet performers needs to be just that, street performers. Yes, Esperpento lets this Mariachi band in to play music (per some of the regular patrons). Free entertainment for the restaurant. I don't mind them playing music, but when it's blaring right next to my ears and raining spit while I'm eating....that's when I get irritated. The worst part is that they rudely walked around to each of us at our table & shoved their tip bag in our faces, saying nothing more than \"tip please\"...

My 2nd favorite dish of the night. The artichoke was nicely charred and crisp, the perfect salty-garlicky treat! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=I0vZXzmJZ7dIvAz-6Xy0mg\n\n* CALAMARES A LA PLANCHA ($6.50)\nTender calamari pieces were tossed in an olive oil/garlic/parsley mixture & grilled to perfection. So tender! The grilled onions & tomatoes lacked seasoning, a pinch of salt would've made it perfect.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=WqgbuGA270_uGnUJXyd5Fw\n\nCALAMARES FRITOS ($6.50)\nYou all know how much I love my fried calamari, I couldn't pass this up.

It was the last to arrive bc it took more than 30mins, so by then we were all done with everything else & just sat around waiting. It turned out to be a disappointing dish, not worth the wait.\n\nThe lobster tails were overcooked & dry. It was funny to see some of us fighting to get the meat out from the shell, it was pretty tough & stringy! \n\nThe calamari was thin, it's like chewing on rubber bands. In this pic, you can see how thin the calamari rings were, almost the same diameter as the peas.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=TUVOMbKAbk_dJCHvVJZsNg\n\nThe most essential part of a great paella is the rice, the protein & veggies only adds flavor to the dish. The 'socarrat' is what I look forward to in a well-made paella. It's the crusty-crunchy rice layer that forms at the bottom of the pan, where all the flavors of the ingredients are the most concentrated. This is only possible when the pan is cooked over very high heat or an open fire. Cooking in an oven will only give you soggy risotto like this:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=qRbH0Pxi8M67mihOp63fjQ\n\nI didn't get a saffron kick at all.

It's not the best paella that I've had, but when you squeeze the lemon on top of the black rice, it's a pleasant bite. \n\nAs for the service, I can understand why people have complained about the waiters/waitresses not being as attentive. There were a few times that we had to ask our waiter to refill our water cups. But other than that, the staff was perfectly friendly. I do have to say that being approached more than once by the live music performers was a little much, but it contributes to the lively atmosphere of the place. \n\nWhenever I'm missing Spain, I'll be sure to come back to Esperpento again!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["I relished the succulence of the mushrooms and was pleased they were still tender and chunky\n\nCalamares Fritos\nLight crisp texture, sadly they were over salted\n\n"], "author": "Jaylena P.", "review": "Bring friends or bring the family, just bring somebody to help you order plenty from the menu.

So when my friend Daniel L. suggested that I try their popular Lobster Paella, I knew I had to check this place out before leaving SF. I love my paellas, whether it be the traditional Valenciana or the Mixta (meat & seafood, the best of both worlds!). I've been craving for a paella fix for quite some time since my last binge, the added tapas menu sealed the deal for me. \n\nWe made reservations on my last night in SF. Our reservation was for 7:45pm but we had to wait a while because our table was still occupied. No biggie, I was still stuffed from my snack a couple hours earlier at Hog Island Oyster Co. Our server was very apologetic & even gave us free Sangria for the wait, sweet!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=jZq2dxyRcUoJfO78-c4rhQ\n\nOverall, the food was okay. There were a couple items that I liked & would probably order again. But the overall experience and 30min wait for the paella left me a bit disappointed. Everyone was done with their appetizers and entrees, but I was still waiting on my paella. \n\n The restaurant is not that big, pretty crowded w/tables being closely spaced, to the point that my chair would get kicked by servers during passing (I even got an elbow to the shoulder as one server was carrying plates of food pass me). My point: There's just no room for an in-your-face Mariachi band. \n\nStreet performers needs to be just that, street performers. Yes, Esperpento lets this Mariachi band in to play music (per some of the regular patrons). Free entertainment for the restaurant. I don't mind them playing music, but when it's blaring right next to my ears and raining spit while I'm eating....that's when I get irritated. The worst part is that they rudely walked around to each of us at our table & shoved their tip bag in our faces, saying nothing more than \"tip please\"... WTF?!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=HE6VEuaHiQjV2zXNnNhBww\n\nOkay, now that I've got that out of my system, let's talk food. I'll start with the good (indicated w/ *):\n\n* MEJILLONES A LA VINAIGRETTE ($6)\nSteamed mussels in a spicy-garlicky butter sauce. The sweet shallots & chili flakes complimented the very plump, well-cooked mussels. I should've ordered 2 of these. I also wished that there were bread to sop up all of that goodness on the bottom of the bowl.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=1WsMI5GslpqXbI4oiE8_nQ\n\n* ALCACHOFAS A LA PLANCHA ($5.50): \nThinly sliced artichokes are grilled with garlic and parsley. My 2nd favorite dish of the night. The artichoke was nicely charred and crisp, the perfect salty-garlicky treat! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=I0vZXzmJZ7dIvAz-6Xy0mg\n\n* CALAMARES A LA PLANCHA ($6.50)\nTender calamari pieces were tossed in an olive oil/garlic/parsley mixture & grilled to perfection. So tender! The grilled onions & tomatoes lacked seasoning, a pinch of salt would've made it perfect.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=WqgbuGA270_uGnUJXyd5Fw\n\nCALAMARES FRITOS ($6.50)\nYou all know how much I love my fried calamari, I couldn't pass this up. Wish I did though because it was a soggy-greasy mess. I prefer my fried calamari to be crisp and not soft.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=2xCaESzL1G46CYLw79RJ2w\n \nPAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA/LOBSTER PAELLA ($28 for a portion big enough for 2, $50 for 4 people & $75 for 6):\n\nOurs had 2 small lobster tails (split into 4 halves), clams, calamari & peas.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=ruJ0AaBcoJjfsl4_PX_x0Q\n\nThis was suppose to be my entree. It was the last to arrive bc it took more than 30mins, so by then we were all done with everything else & just sat around waiting. It turned out to be a disappointing dish, not worth the wait.\n\nThe lobster tails were overcooked & dry. It was funny to see some of us fighting to get the meat out from the shell, it was pretty tough & stringy! \n\nThe calamari was thin, it's like chewing on rubber bands. In this pic, you can see how thin the calamari rings were, almost the same diameter as the peas.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=TUVOMbKAbk_dJCHvVJZsNg\n\nThe most essential part of a great paella is the rice, the protein & veggies only adds flavor to the dish. The 'socarrat' is what I look forward to in a well-made paella. It's the crusty-crunchy rice layer that forms at the bottom of the pan, where all the flavors of the ingredients are the most concentrated. This is only possible when the pan is cooked over very high heat or an open fire. Cooking in an oven will only give you soggy risotto like this:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=qRbH0Pxi8M67mihOp63fjQ\n\nI didn't get a saffron kick at all.

So we were all present 15 mins. after our reservation time. \n\nMike, the host, was professional.  Even though we kept following up (i.e. bugging him) he didn't get his feathers ruffled.  \n\nWe also didn't get seated until 45 mins. AFTER our reservation time.  Why even take reservations then?!\n\nOnce seated, we were given our water and handed menus.  Our waitress, who SHALL remain nameless, was not a happy camper.  Lady, I know it sucks working on a Friday night -- I work swing shift and there were many, many Friday nights when I'm stuck at work and all my friends were out partying.  Please.  Whatever her problem was it showed on her face and carried onto her attitude. \n\nThe menu is quite varied and for vegetarians, I'm happy to report that there are more than a few options available.\n\nA few yelpers also recommended the paella. The special for that night was lobster and calamari paella, we went with the $48 portion which serves 4 people (instead of the $68 for 6). We also wanted to try the meat paella. But got talked out of it.\n\nOur waitress puts in her \"helpful\" suggestion and says, \"well, are you sure you want ALL that pella?\"\n\n\"Well, you haven't seen my brother eat.\"  I jokingly said while pointing to my 6 foot, 200 lb. sibling. \n\nHer: \"yeah, but you'll be ordering tapas. That would be a lot of food\"\n\nMe: \"we would like to try a different paella too. Can't we just box the leftovers to go?\"\n\nHer: \"yeah. sure.\"\n\nAt this point, I felt like I was arguing with our server so I just dropped it. \n\nThe whole table shared and enjoyed every bite of these delicious tapas:\n\n3 plates of spicy patatas bravas, jamon serrano, oxtail stew, grilled asparagus, 3 plates of calamares fritos, 2 plates of gambas al ajillo, grilled salmon and our paella. \n\nEsperpento's sangria isn't as fruity or chilled like cha cha cha's.

My bro just has a big appetite.  So that was a bad decision on my part. I should've ordered that second paella because I know my brother more than our waitress.  She did check up on us, but quite frankly, we saw the busboy more often.

We found ourselves in The Mission and hungry... at kind of an odd/late-ish lunch hour, this is where we ended up.\n\nI always try to drink the young Spanish vino here because it seems like the right place to ingest alcohol.  And then I remember that I'm (a) an Asian chick who (b) cannot metabolize alcohol and (c) weighs a buck and change - far too late and my cheeks are flushed, my head is spinning and I'm always on the cusp of doing something regrettable that might return, captured on film to haunt me.  So, this is the closest I ever feel to living my life as Darin I. for a few hours.  \n\nForgive the brusque run down; the menu is rather large and we've sampled a fair number of their staples.  Anyhoo:\n\nThe patatas alioli - wish they were crispier and the garlicky mayo served on the side... but that doesn't stop me from shoveling them into my mouth.  But it's definitely a brush-and-floss as soon as you can situation; best to pack some breath mints.\n\nManchego - served COLD in a drizzle of olive oil with a resigned marinated pepper in the middle.  Disappointing, because this cheese really is delicious - I prefer to eat it with membrillo, which they do not offer, which is a pity.\n\nAlbondigas - we like to scoop the saffron-jacked sauce up with pieces of bread; the meatballs themselves, not so much.  I think they are heavy and dense for my taste.\n\nAlcochofas (artichokes) a la plancha:  these are actually special; thin sliced baby artichokes with garlic and olive oil... we order these every time; they're lovely.\n\nCalamares fritos: this dish is delicately battered and served with a big side of alioli.  The Caveman never regrets putting tentacles in his mouth when this plate arrives at the table.

Icky.  \n\nGambas al Ajillo:  The shrimp was frozen and/or waaaaay overcooked, drowned in garlic and olive oil.  This is a very simple dish that can be such an epiphany with fresh ingredients; a real disappointment.  \n\nRopa Vieja... the ingredients in this stew were overcooked and their flavors muddled; the beef component was tough and made it difficult to enjoy the dish.  Ditto for the adobo stew we had a few visits back.\n\nQuail a la plancha - I was really looking forward to this tapa, but the quail was so small and... not plump; I had a difficult time attempting to cut any of the meat off the bird.  I felt almost defeated because I hardly got a taste of the actual dish; it was kind of an exercise in futility.  \n\nThe portions are generous and it's best to go with a group so that you can share.  It's emotionally difficult for me to concede that the food is pretty middle of the road because they don't feature seasonal specialties, which is what I'd rather have them do.  Smaller menu, with in-season highlights, instead of a vast selection that depends upon frozen and otherwise stabilized ingredients.  \n\nI'm skewing high in my rating of this place; I'm a bit sentimental about it.

Ehh, not my favorite thing to do...but wait...\n\n\"Ooooh! found it!\" *in a sing song voice*\n\nNow I know tonight's gonna be a good night :)\n\nAfter parking in our spot 2 blocks away from the restaurant, we started our trek towards Esperpento.  As we walked towards the restaurant, we were greeted by tons of laughter, people and an overly-annoying Mariachi band.  Blech.  Luckily I made reservations so in no time, our party was seated.  This was an all girls dinner - hard to come by - so drinks were definitely in order.  We ordered our favorite, Sangria.  \n\nO.\nM.\nG.\n\nThat crap was disgusting.  I could barely finish my own glass.  This was unheard of in the world of Lisa Wong...but I digress.\n\nThe menu looked so appetizing I almost wanted to eat it...OKOK, I was really hungry. Geezus.

We had to get 2 orders because they were THAT good.  Crispy, little brown potatoes slathered with a spicy orange sauce.  Hmmmm...\n\nThe mussels?  OMG, what kind of vinaigrette was that?!  The mussels were swimming in an ocean of sweet and tangy waters that had my lips smacking.  Too bad there was only enough to go around. hmph.\n\nThe cabbage was nothing like I have ever tasted in a restaurant.  I mean, who orders cabbage?  Well, at Esperpento...I DO!  Crunchy cabbage sauteed with garlic and paprika, so fragrant you forget you're eating a vegetable.  \n\nThe seafood paella was also very delicious; it was actually my very first paella!  I'm not sure what the normal consistency is but I wish it was slightly creamier....Just to warn you, that dish takes 30 minutes to prepare so order that first!  It's a HUMONGOUS dish btw - so big they had to clear out the area before plopping it on our table.  \n\nThe rest of the food was...mediocre at best.  I wasn't blown away at all.\n\nThe potato omelet? It was dry and needed some kind of sauce.\n\nThe oxtail stew?  I've had better.\n\nThe beef stew?  Ehhh.\n\nThe calamari?!  Don't even get me started...that thing was NOT fried, and not seasoned at all.\n\nEven though there were a few misses, this restaurant is definitely worth visiting.

A million times yes!\n\nI went here last week for my birthday, and felt totally blessed things worked out the way they did. Last Saturday I was totally frustrated and still kicking myself in the ass for not planning my dinner more than 4 hours before dinner was scheduled. I called Esperpento earlier to see if they had anything open, to which they replied it would be infinitely impossible to acquiesce my request. Well, they actually said it was \"too late for reservations\" but I had to throw some big word usage on ya ass! Ya know you need it.\n\nYet right before leaving for a delectable dining experience at Friday's (yes, I was that desperate), a voice in my head told me to call Esperpento one last time. Don't worry, it wasn't the scurry *kill your Mother* type voice - more like an intuitive, calling from God, conscience type. So I called to see if they had any tables open for a party of ten. The owner's son, who's totally cool, said he would hold the table for us until we got there. He didn't even ask us how long we'd be, he just said he'd hold it. SCORE! About an hour later we all arrived, the table still held for us even though there were others waiting to be seated.\n\nRight away we ordered the seafood paella (takes 30 minutes), sangria, and the fried calamari (the best ever!). Yup, we knew our stuff. Of all the patatas, the patatas bravas were the BEST. The grilled/fried calamari dishes were both perfectly seasoned, the Champinones Al Ajillo were delicious, and the HUGE grilled veggie salad was the perfect way to add more veggies to the two GIGANTIC meat platters  (carnes de pajarillas?). Just like NKOTB, we had all the Right Stuff - Three-Points!\n\nAnother SCORE, you ask? Being seated upstairs. This was perfect for us, since there wasn't as much room downstairs for my man to stumble around half-drunk, handing out extra birthday cake to lucky patrons. It felt like I had the best of everything that night - food, companionship, laughter, and love.\n\nThe only complaint? I went here two months ago for Valentine's and noticed they jacked all tapas prices up by a dollar/two.\n\ne.g. Patatas bravas/alioli $4.50 then, $5.75 now\n       Calamares fritos $6 then, 7.75 now\n\nStill, I would definitely return to Esperpento any time!

Yes, Esperpento lets this Mariachi band in to play music (per some of the regular patrons). Free entertainment for the restaurant.

It was the last to arrive bc it took more than 30mins, so by then we were all done with everything else & just sat around waiting. It turned out to be a disappointing dish, not worth the wait.\n\nThe lobster tails were overcooked & dry.

The 'socarrat' is what I look forward to in a well-made paella. It's the crusty-crunchy rice layer that forms at the bottom of the pan, where all the flavors of the ingredients are the most concentrated. This is only possible when the pan is cooked over very high heat or an open fire. Cooking in an oven will only give you soggy risotto like this:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=qRbH0Pxi8M67mihOp63fjQ\n\nI didn't get a saffron kick at all.

The only downside was that it was too late to order paella.\n\nWe ordered a whole bunch of tapas dishes and literally everything we ate was amazing.  Let's do a play by play so you can really understand how good it was.  First, bread and a spicy aioli sauce to dip in.  Simple but really really good, even after we got our food, we asked for more bread and dip.  The sauces in all the seafood plates are highly dippable and the spicy dip is highly spreadable on anything.\n\nNext was grilled clams in olive oil and parsley.  We couldn't decide between the clams with marinara sauce or olive oil and the waiter suggested the olive oil.  The sauce was ridiculously flavorful.  If everything else weren't so good, I would've been content to eat a whole plate of bread dipped in that sauce.\n\nJamon Serrano.  What to say here?  It's salty cured meat on a piece of toast.  What is there not to like?  We had also ordered anchovies, so slap one of those on top of the jamon and slather some of that spicy dip and it's even better.\n\nOxtail stew was savory and comforting.  The chunks of meat were so tender, they fell right off the bone.\n\nGrilled quail with rosemary potatoes.  The skin was perfectly crisp and the flavor was on point.  The potatoes were also the bomb diggity, exploding with flavor.\n\nGrilled artichoke was one of my favorites.  The pieces are sliced through the whole artichoke, not just the heart, so you can see the layers of leaves.  The grill flavor was wonderful.  I have never seen this before and will probably order this over and over again.\n\nGrilled scallops came with three large pieces on a skewer with yellow rice.  The flavor was good but the portion was a little skimpy.\n\nAll in all, we were totally stuffed.  Did we over order in a panic that the kitchen was going to close?  Maybe.  Do we regret it?  Not one bit.  The service was great and not once did we feel rushed.  The kitchen closed at their stated closing time but all the other patrons in the restaurant continued to hang out and enjoy their wine.\n\nThis is the best tapas I've had since eating in Spain and most of the dishes are very reasonable priced.

I realize this review is bit dated but as I was looking through my notes on my BB, I realized that I never wrote a review for Esperpento (Yes, I'm a nerd and take notes.) That night, we (party of 6) walked in w/o reservations at 6 PM and were seated upstairs w/ only a 2-3 min wait. We knew our table may not be large enough for all our food so we asked if we can add the empty table next to us to our table which our waiter was more than happy to oblige.\n\nF O O D / D R I N K S:\n*3 PITCHERS OF SANGRA ($17/ea): Smooth and full of fruity flavors and notes w/ a touch of an acidic bite. The bits of apple and oranges gave it an extra burst of sweetness. \n\n*PAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA - Lobster Paella (Serving for 4 - $50): DISAPPOINTING!!!\n\nI'm no Paella expert but I've had paella enough times and watch enough Food Network and Travel Channel to know the components that make a good paella. Other Yelpers have raved about Esperpento's paella but that night our paella was a complete fail. \n\nRICE: The rice was firm but had a creamy risotto like consistency (not dry and separate the way it should be). It was flavorful and had soaked up all the liquids and aromatics (i.e. onions, garlic, saffron and other herbs) but it also had an off putting fishiness to it.\n\nSOCARRAT: Perhaps the heating source wasn't sufficient or the incorrect pan was used, but the paella lacked the golden caramelized bottom crust which is quintessential to a good paella.  \n\nTOPPINGS: The lobster (4 lobster tails halved) was overcooked, dry, stringy and bland and the calamari had a prominent fishiness to it. We utilized all 10 lemon wedges to add some moistness and to hide the unappetizing fishy flavor. \n\nTAPAS: Serving size per a tapa was 2-3 people so we ordered 2 orders for some dishes.\n\n*2 JAMON SERRANO - Cured Ham on French Bread ($6) SIMPLY DELICIOUS! Crusty bread topped w/ a salty and fatty slice of ham w/ thick slices of tomatoes for sweetness and tang.\n\n*2 PATAS BRAVAS -Spicy Potatoes ($4.50): YUMMY! The potatoes had a super crisp exterior w/ a pillowly soft interior. The spicy aioli was rich and creamy w/ nice kick of heat.\n\n*2 CROQUETAS DE POLLA - Chicken Croquettes ($5): SAVORY & COMFORTING! The croquettes were fried to a golden brown w/ an extra crisp crust and filled w/ a savory creamed chicken mixture. The accompanying creamed spinach sauce added a tangy zip and an extra layer of richness.\n\n*CALAMARES A LA PANCHA - Grilled Calamari ($6.75): GOOD! The calamari was perfectly grilled to a sweet tenderness and was flavorful w/ a subtle smokiness.\n\n*MEJILLONES A LA PLACHA - Grilled Mussels ($7): GOOD! The sweet and tender mussels were bathing in a savory and rich broth w/ herbaceous notes brightened w/ the splash of lemons. Our complimentary crusty bread was perfect for dunking and soaking up all the brothy goodness.\n\n*GAMBAS AJILLO SHRIMP - Garlic Shrimp ($7): GARLICKY GOODNESS! The tender and sweet shrimp albeit small were bathing in garlic sauce which was buttery, robust and full of bold garlicky flavor.\n\n*RABO TORO - Oxtail Stew ($7): COMFORTING! The oxtail was fall-off-the-bone tender and was in a rich and savory broth. The broth had a depth of flavor as if the oxtails, veggies and herbs had been simmering for hours.\n\n*ROPA VIEJO - Beef, Chicken & Chorizo Stew ($5.50): OK. The beef and chicken were dry and there was a lack of chorizo to give the stew a rich and smoky flavor.\n\n*CHAMPINONES AL AJILLO - Mushroom w/ Garlic ($5.25): DELISH! The mushrooms were tender and meaty w/ a distinct garlic flavor that wasn't overwhelming and sprinkles of parsley for a pop of freshness.\n\n*ASPARAGUS A LA PLANCHA - Grilled Asparagus Ala Plancha ($5.25): PERFECTLY COOKED! The large spears were vibrant green and tender, yet had the crisp al-dente bite to it. The spicy aioli gave it a layer of creaminess w/ a slight kick and the lemons a citrus punch.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was friendly, down-to-earth and attentive. \n\nOur food came out quickly w/ only a 5 min wait for our first dish while the others quickly followed suit.

Why even take reservations then?!\n\nOnce seated, we were given our water and handed menus.  Our waitress, who SHALL remain nameless, was not a happy camper.

Whatever her problem was it showed on her face and carried onto her attitude. \n\nThe menu is quite varied and for vegetarians, I'm happy to report that there are more than a few options available.\n\nA few yelpers also recommended the paella. The special for that night was lobster and calamari paella, we went with the $48 portion which serves 4 people (instead of the $68 for 6). We also wanted to try the meat paella. But got talked out of it.\n\nOur waitress puts in her \"helpful\" suggestion and says, \"well, are you sure you want ALL that pella?\"\n\n\"Well, you haven't seen my brother eat.\"  I jokingly said while pointing to my 6 foot, 200 lb. sibling. \n\nHer: \"yeah, but you'll be ordering tapas. That would be a lot of food\"\n\nMe: \"we would like to try a different paella too.

My bro just has a big appetite.  So that was a bad decision on my part. I should've ordered that second paella because I know my brother more than our waitress.

However, I'll be frank and admit that I am a lazy person, and I usually just bitch about a bad restaurant to my friends, while never fully documenting the extent of my displeasure. \n\nToday is different. \n\nThe horrible service and mediocre food I received at this restaurant compelled me to write this review. I've been to Esperpento before, probably about a year and half ago, and I remembered it to be good (not write-home-able, but good) tapas. However, tonight's experience proved vastly different, and has rendered Esperpento as null in my array of viable restaurant options in the Mission, my 'hood.\n\nMy partner and I decided to pop over to Esperpento to get some dinner, after eschewing two other eateries due to their double dolla sign status.  We'd been to Esperpento before, and thought it would be a safe, easy bet. We were wrong.\n\nFirst off, we were seated within a few minutes, which was great. We sat down and surveyed the menu, figuring out what we wanted. We closed our menus and sat patiently and watched the symphony of bad service, which was to be the story of our evening, play out. \n\nJust before we were seated and given menus, another couple walked into the restaurant that clearly knew the waitress. Not only did they walk in 10 minutes after us, but they were seated and served FOOD nearly 10 minutes before we were even asked for our drink orders. Oh wait, and actually, we WEREN'T asked for our drink orders. After getting so hungry waiting for 10 minutes to be seated (generally not a big deal), and 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a waiter or offered drinks or bread, I had to physically get up and ask the bus person if we could please have some bread. She offered to take our order and we quickly listed off our tapas choices.  We were brought our wine in a fairly reasonable time (Rioja something or other. It was no better than the 4 buck Bear's Lair Trader Joe's Cab).\nOur bread arrived shortly after, and was stale (\"authentic Spanish stale bread\" my boyfriend, who lived in Barcelona for 2 years, retorted). We nibbled on the stale bread and the dishes that followed, however, the quality was far under par. \n\nThe Jamon Serrano en Pan con Tomate was delicious (it's hard to mess up cured ham). That was were the flavor ended. The eggplant dish was mediocre, the Tortilla de Patatas was bland and flavorless, and as I write this review now, my boyfriend is lying on the couch clutching his stomach from the rancid boccarones (I didn't eat them, but he insisted).  Seriously, he is ill. What's more, we had to rally in order to get ourselves out of the place. Not once, twice, but three times did we verbally discuss a viable dine 'n ditch scenario! After our plates were cleared and we waited the usually 10 minutes, again I had to get up to ask the server for our check!\n\nOne pepto bismal tablet for my man and a beer at the phoenix to calm my  nerves, and I'm finally able to express myself about the horrible time we had at esperpento. \n\nSUMMARY (I know I can blab so here's the meaty bit)...\nGreat jamon serrano en pan con tomate, but that's where it ends.\n\nUsually, great food can erase the pain that bad service leaves, but not this time. This caliber of bad service incites a special kind of frustration, especially when guests who arrive AFTER you receive service first, and basic attention has to be requested of the wait staff by getting up out of your seat. Additionally, when the food you receive is mediocre at best and incites stomach cramping, it leaves you feeling like you've been taken advantage of. \n\nI like the idea of Esperpento: Love the ambiance, love the decorations. And I know people have bad days. However, when the waitress who was supposed to be attending our table brought our check, and innocently asked, \"How was everything?\" I quickly gave her my honest feedback. She was not phased by my complaints of unsatisfactory service and food, and replied, \"Oh.\" \n\n\"Oh\" is right.\n\nOn second thought, make that a \"NOh!\"", "rating": 1, "date": "2007-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The calamari tastes fresher and their jamon serrano and manchego cheese was pretty good the last time I had it.

You see, the thing is that I wasn't at all that impressed with the tapas in Spain. Maybe, it was the establishments that we went to, but I thought that couldn't have been it, because every tapas restaurant that we ate at, was super crowded  and at one place we had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a table. I couldn't figure it out.\nWhy was the tapas in Spain just ok?\nNow, I'm here in the Bay Area for a few days of recovery and decompression from a 24hrs + transition from France via London.\nAnd, my friends wanted to hang out and have dinner before I head down to SoCal and get back to reality.\nJC gave us 3 places to chose from where she's eaten before and it was in the area where she lives.\nPretty convenient. Cool.\nEsperento was one of them.\nFunny thing though, we actually decided on Thai food.\nWe get to Osha and there are about 20 empty seats and about 2 tables of 4 tops paying their bills, and the hostess/waitress says that their booked for reservations. And there was only 3 of us. What-ever!\nSo we decide Indian. Dosa. Line out the door. Oh man.\nNext!\nEsperpento it is.\nCool.\nWe get there and there are only about 4 parties ( about a dozen or so peoples). I usually consider and empty restaurant  on a busy avenue a bad thing. But at this point I didn't care. I was hungry.\nWe walk in and we're promptly and politely greeted by a gorgeous Latina, and we're sat at a perfect size table, right by the window.\nNice. Thanks you.\nThe menus is quite extensive and worn out. (good sign)\nOh man. Paella extravaganza and SO many variable of tapas to pick and chose and combine to create a feast of your fancy.\nVery very nice.\nNot too many beers to chose from. Sad. They were out of Negro Modelo (one of the 3 beers they had to chose from) so i settled for and Anchor Steam. Mm. Great.\nAfter about 15 minutes and extensive item suggestions between ourselves, we finally have some idea on what we want.\nActually we didn't, but I thought we did.\nSo, on the fly this is what we got:\n\nTortilla De Patata - potato and onion omelet (basic tortilla Espagnol),\nthe potatoes were nice and soft and the eggs were velvety,moist and soft. And what ever that creme fraiche like sauce was? It made the dish even more delicious.\nChampinon Al Ajillo - mushrooms saluteed with garlic. One of my favorite types of food in the world is mushrooms (any kind, really) but it's gotta be sauteed. Mm. It's pretty basic and simple. These were very good. The mushroom were fairly large and very plump.\nGambas Al Ajillo- garlic shrimp. Lots of garlic and delicious. Although I felt that the shrimp was a bit on the small size. Hah! \nPollo Adobo - spicy exotic chicken. Huh? They serve Filipino food? Nah, this was cooked a lot differently. There was a lot of garlic in this dish as well and I think it was sauteed in red wine and maybe a little sherry. Of course there was some other spices in it. It was really good, but not what I was expecting. Hm?\nWe got a side of rice that was probably cooked with some kind of stock (chicken?) and there were some vegetables, herbs and spices. Again, simple and delicious.\nAnd for the piece de la resistance(insert trumpets here), we ordered the:\nParrillada De Carne - a montain o' grilled meats!  Chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage. hell yeah!), and some other sausage(which tasted like my most favorite of meats: spam!), grilled chicken, pork kebabs and carne asada (skirt steak?) on a bed of what might have either grilled or baked potatoes, topped with grilled red and green onions. \nFellow carnivores. This is your dish. Oh yeah! It's on.\n\nNeedless to say. Once again we ordered more food than was possible to consume. But dammit. We gave it our best shot.\n\nOk. So here's what I figured out.\nOne. Garlic and salt. That is what was laking in the foods in Barcelona. Not that it didn't have any, but that it didn't have enough. Or what I would have preferred.\nTwo. Esperpento rocks.\nNow two things I didn't like about Esperpento.\nOne. Minuscule beer list. Aw. Hey Esperpento folks. Beer is good. Lot's of beer to chose  from is better.\nTwo. Frozen steak. Yuck. Please don't freeze meat for too long.\nIt fucks up the color, taste and texture. 2-3 days at most. Or, get higher quality beef. You can up the price on the menu if you have to.\nI feel people won't mind paying a little extra if the quality is well worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, relaxed, comfortable and still a bit lively.\nThe service is great. Our server was attentive, but not intrusive.\nAnd the over all quality of the food is pretty freakin' good.\nThe bill was the most impressive part.

After about 20 minutes I begin noticing something... people that were seated after us are getting drinks, they've ordered, and in one particular case, one table had already started getting food. We haven't even gotten our WATER yet, let alone had a chance to order. So, doing what any normal person would do, I flagged down one of the staff and asked if we could order. He smiled, nodded, and disappeared.\n\n*Time goes by.*\n\n10 minutes later I have to ask again to order, the server I asked did his best to get away, but he knew he couldn't just walk off after smiling and saying yes. So, we ordered, finally. (For those counting, we've been sitting for at least 30 minutes.) We got some great tapas dishes, and a paella de carne. We also ordered a carafe of some of the best sangria I've had in my life.\n\nMost of the tapas and the sangria came fast... however, we never were offered water refills, or even asked if we wanted more sangria. *WE DID*\n\nWe ordered some great tasty mushrooms, masterfully crafted clams, truly flavorful and spicy patatas bravas, and a fairly well done pinchos morunos (pork kebab.), however we also ordered the morcilla sausages... after we had finished all this, we waited about 10 minutes and flagged down our server to find out where the missing morcilla sausages were... \"Oh yes, sorry.\" and then he disappears. To his credit, they came out 5 minutes later, and they are by far my favorite thing on the menu.\n\nNow during this time, we have empty drinks, empty bread, and a slew of empty plates in front of us. The plates were eventually removed, but no one came by to offer more bread, water, or sangria. On the bright side, they did take a birthday dessert to another table... (... that table got great service, all 4 of them. :) Grrr. Drinks, bread, and birthday wishes.)\n\nWhen the paella de carne came, I didn't care about them anymore, I saw this beautifully luscious rice creation in front of me, and my world went all paella crazy.

We later found out that the place has been so busy that they don't have time to pick the phone, and so if you have party of 8 or more, I would suggest to keep trying otherwise, you just have to show up a bit early and wait.  We were told that it would take 15-30 minutes for a table for two and waited outside.  We asked if we can order something to drink while we were waiting and they brought us sangria which was fabulous.  The sangria had cubes of oranges with its rind and apples.  Very enjoyable and wanted to order another glass. We were careful enough not to drink the sangria too fast so that we can enjoy our tapas.  \n\nWe were finally seated indoors and so excited to try so many dishes but unfortunately on that night the lights went out and had to use candles in which you could not see what was on the menu.  We decided to have the house red wine, to our surprise the wine was really good and good paring with the food we ordered.  We ordered the following: Chorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" sauteed Spanish sausage, Queso Manchego Spanish ewe's milk cheese, Patatas Aioli homemade garlic mayonnaise, Rabo Toro, Oxtail Stew , Gambas Al Ajillo garlic shrimp, and Ropa Viejo beef, chicken, and chorizo stew.  The food we selected were all good, but I wish we had better lighting so that we can see the rest of the menu. The Rabo Toro, Oxtail stew was okay, nothing to brag about, the meat was tender but it was lacking something.  I really thought I would taste the richness of the of the meat in the broth but it was just ordinary.  The Queso Manchego Spanish cheese was good, but too plain.  I thought they would add something to the cheese to elevate the flavor more.  But now I know not to order these two items in my next visit.  For sure I would go back to try the seafood and of course the Paella.  \n\nWhen we got our bill, we noticed that they did not charge us for the sangria and for the amount of food we ate, it did not break the bank. So inexpensive and you get to try different dishes.\n\nThis is a fun place to go especially if you are with a large group.

We had to get 2 orders because they were THAT good.  Crispy, little brown potatoes slathered with a spicy orange sauce.  Hmmmm...\n\nThe mussels?  OMG, what kind of vinaigrette was that?!  The mussels were swimming in an ocean of sweet and tangy waters that had my lips smacking.  Too bad there was only enough to go around. hmph.\n\nThe cabbage was nothing like I have ever tasted in a restaurant.  I mean, who orders cabbage?  Well, at Esperpento...I DO!  Crunchy cabbage sauteed with garlic and paprika, so fragrant you forget you're eating a vegetable.  \n\nThe seafood paella was also very delicious; it was actually my very first paella!  I'm not sure what the normal consistency is but I wish it was slightly creamier....Just to warn you, that dish takes 30 minutes to prepare so order that first!  It's a HUMONGOUS dish btw - so big they had to clear out the area before plopping it on our table.  \n\nThe rest of the food was...mediocre at best.  I wasn't blown away at all.\n\nThe potato omelet? It was dry and needed some kind of sauce.\n\nThe oxtail stew?  I've had better.\n\nThe beef stew?  Ehhh.\n\nThe calamari?!  Don't even get me started...that thing was NOT fried, and not seasoned at all.\n\nEven though there were a few misses, this restaurant is definitely worth visiting.  The ambiance, the people, the servers were all very pleasant to be around.  All in all, a great dining experience for my good friends and I on a random Friday night in the city.\n\nI do look forward to returning...maybe this time, the Mariachi Band will not be serenading our table ;)", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-09-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We shared the Rabo Toro, Ox-tail stew (good), the Brocheta De Vieiras scallops brochette (this was just okay), and the Tortilla De Patata potato and onion omelet (pretty good).

You see, the thing is that I wasn't at all that impressed with the tapas in Spain. Maybe, it was the establishments that we went to, but I thought that couldn't have been it, because every tapas restaurant that we ate at, was super crowded  and at one place we had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a table. I couldn't figure it out.\nWhy was the tapas in Spain just ok?\nNow, I'm here in the Bay Area for a few days of recovery and decompression from a 24hrs + transition from France via London.\nAnd, my friends wanted to hang out and have dinner before I head down to SoCal and get back to reality.\nJC gave us 3 places to chose from where she's eaten before and it was in the area where she lives.\nPretty convenient. Cool.\nEsperento was one of them.\nFunny thing though, we actually decided on Thai food.\nWe get to Osha and there are about 20 empty seats and about 2 tables of 4 tops paying their bills, and the hostess/waitress says that their booked for reservations. And there was only 3 of us. What-ever!\nSo we decide Indian. Dosa. Line out the door. Oh man.\nNext!\nEsperpento it is.\nCool.\nWe get there and there are only about 4 parties ( about a dozen or so peoples). I usually consider and empty restaurant  on a busy avenue a bad thing. But at this point I didn't care. I was hungry.\nWe walk in and we're promptly and politely greeted by a gorgeous Latina, and we're sat at a perfect size table, right by the window.\nNice. Thanks you.\nThe menus is quite extensive and worn out. (good sign)\nOh man. Paella extravaganza and SO many variable of tapas to pick and chose and combine to create a feast of your fancy.\nVery very nice.\nNot too many beers to chose from. Sad. They were out of Negro Modelo (one of the 3 beers they had to chose from) so i settled for and Anchor Steam. Mm. Great.\nAfter about 15 minutes and extensive item suggestions between ourselves, we finally have some idea on what we want.\nActually we didn't, but I thought we did.\nSo, on the fly this is what we got:\n\nTortilla De Patata - potato and onion omelet (basic tortilla Espagnol),\nthe potatoes were nice and soft and the eggs were velvety,moist and soft. And what ever that creme fraiche like sauce was? It made the dish even more delicious.\nChampinon Al Ajillo - mushrooms saluteed with garlic. One of my favorite types of food in the world is mushrooms (any kind, really) but it's gotta be sauteed. Mm. It's pretty basic and simple. These were very good. The mushroom were fairly large and very plump.\nGambas Al Ajillo- garlic shrimp. Lots of garlic and delicious. Although I felt that the shrimp was a bit on the small size. Hah! \nPollo Adobo - spicy exotic chicken. Huh? They serve Filipino food? Nah, this was cooked a lot differently. There was a lot of garlic in this dish as well and I think it was sauteed in red wine and maybe a little sherry. Of course there was some other spices in it. It was really good, but not what I was expecting. Hm?\nWe got a side of rice that was probably cooked with some kind of stock (chicken?) and there were some vegetables, herbs and spices. Again, simple and delicious.\nAnd for the piece de la resistance(insert trumpets here), we ordered the:\nParrillada De Carne - a montain o' grilled meats!  Chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage. hell yeah!), and some other sausage(which tasted like my most favorite of meats: spam!), grilled chicken, pork kebabs and carne asada (skirt steak?) on a bed of what might have either grilled or baked potatoes, topped with grilled red and green onions. \nFellow carnivores. This is your dish. Oh yeah! It's on.\n\nNeedless to say. Once again we ordered more food than was possible to consume. But dammit. We gave it our best shot.\n\nOk. So here's what I figured out.\nOne. Garlic and salt. That is what was laking in the foods in Barcelona. Not that it didn't have any, but that it didn't have enough. Or what I would have preferred.\nTwo. Esperpento rocks.\nNow two things I didn't like about Esperpento.\nOne. Minuscule beer list. Aw. Hey Esperpento folks. Beer is good. Lot's of beer to chose  from is better.\nTwo. Frozen steak. Yuck. Please don't freeze meat for too long.\nIt fucks up the color, taste and texture. 2-3 days at most. Or, get higher quality beef. You can up the price on the menu if you have to.\nI feel people won't mind paying a little extra if the quality is well worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, relaxed, comfortable and still a bit lively.\nThe service is great.

They asked for more bread just to finish the sauce off. \nVeggie Paella - I thought it was alright. Not disappointed at all, tho. It depended on what mixture of veggies ended up in my mouth.  I did not care for whatever bean was in there (i think a lima) and that tended to throw off the flavor of everything else. \nMeat and Seafood Paella - I thought this was weird - the meat eaters HATED this but they LOVED the veggie paella. Go figure. \n\nThe environment was lively.  Good mixture of characters.  It wasn't too loud that I couldn't hear people. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive. The only issue was that they came out with the mushrooms after most of the other items were finished.

But we didn't make a reservation anywhere because we just wanted to wing it. Unfortunately, our first choice, a restaurant a couple blocks away, was completely packed, and the wait was going to be 1.5 hours. So we stumbled on this place by accident. And what a wonderful accident it was! There was only a very short wait (like ten minutes) for a table of four on a busy Saturday night.\n\nTo start, I recommend the Sangria - not the glass, the pitcher. At first, I thought there was not enough fruit or alcohol. But I simply asked for more fruit, which they brought out in a bowl, and believe me, there was definitely alcohol in there, which will sneak up on you if you're not careful.\n\nFor tapas, we ordered the Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp). It was probably my favorite dish of the night! Juicy shrimp in a warm garlic sauce that is actually perfect for dipping the bread that they bring you. We also had the Croquetas de Pollo (Chicken Croquettes). Normally, I'm not a fan of croquettes, but these just melted in my mouth, and the sauce was amazing as well. Finally, we had the Patatas Aioli (Garlic Mayonnaise Potatoes), which they mistakenly thought was Patatas Bravas (Spicy Potatoes), so we actually got to try both.\n\nFor our entree, we ordered the Paella de Mariscos for two. There was a bit of a wait for it, but it was well worth the wait! Seasoning was absolutely perfect, and they were very generous with the seafood. The only downside was that we couldn't finish it in one go, so we had to take it home and of course it wasn't as good the next day.\n\nAll of the food was reasonably priced. The restaurant had a very authentic feel and we even had a small band come around the tables and play at one point during the meal. Also, our server was very warm and friendly. He did mess up a couple of our orders, and it took a while for things like drink refills, but we still loved it all.

The chorizo was super flavorful, the aioli on the potatoes was great, and I loved the garlic sauce for the shrimp.  The white bean salad was nice and refreshing with its slightly acidic dressing, which helped cut the richness of a few other dishes.    I could pop those chorizos in my mouth all night long.

We got there at 7 PM and found that the place was crowded. Earlier in the day we tried numerous times to make reservations, but to no avail the phone was never pickup.  We later found out that the place has been so busy that they don't have time to pick the phone, and so if you have party of 8 or more, I would suggest to keep trying otherwise, you just have to show up a bit early and wait.  We were told that it would take 15-30 minutes for a table for two and waited outside.  We asked if we can order something to drink while we were waiting and they brought us sangria which was fabulous.  The sangria had cubes of oranges with its rind and apples.  Very enjoyable and wanted to order another glass. We were careful enough not to drink the sangria too fast so that we can enjoy our tapas.  \n\nWe were finally seated indoors and so excited to try so many dishes but unfortunately on that night the lights went out and had to use candles in which you could not see what was on the menu.

We ordered the following: Chorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" sauteed Spanish sausage, Queso Manchego Spanish ewe's milk cheese, Patatas Aioli homemade garlic mayonnaise, Rabo Toro, Oxtail Stew , Gambas Al Ajillo garlic shrimp, and Ropa Viejo beef, chicken, and chorizo stew.

"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "\"Sorry, we're going to need ANOTHER table (AGAIN).\" One may think it's because we have more people, but in our case it's ALWAYS b/c my friends and I order a plethora amount of food that leaves the wait staff and other patrons (o_O).\n\nOur dinner on Monday, 2.21.11 was no exception. I realize this review is bit dated but as I was looking through my notes on my BB, I realized that I never wrote a review for Esperpento (Yes, I'm a nerd and take notes.) That night, we (party of 6) walked in w/o reservations at 6 PM and were seated upstairs w/ only a 2-3 min wait. We knew our table may not be large enough for all our food so we asked if we can add the empty table next to us to our table which our waiter was more than happy to oblige.\n\nF O O D / D R I N K S:\n*3 PITCHERS OF SANGRA ($17/ea): Smooth and full of fruity flavors and notes w/ a touch of an acidic bite. The bits of apple and oranges gave it an extra burst of sweetness. \n\n*PAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA - Lobster Paella (Serving for 4 - $50): DISAPPOINTING!!!\n\nI'm no Paella expert but I've had paella enough times and watch enough Food Network and Travel Channel to know the components that make a good paella. Other Yelpers have raved about Esperpento's paella but that night our paella was a complete fail. \n\nRICE: The rice was firm but had a creamy risotto like consistency (not dry and separate the way it should be). It was flavorful and had soaked up all the liquids and aromatics (i.e. onions, garlic, saffron and other herbs) but it also had an off putting fishiness to it.\n\nSOCARRAT: Perhaps the heating source wasn't sufficient or the incorrect pan was used, but the paella lacked the golden caramelized bottom crust which is quintessential to a good paella.  \n\nTOPPINGS: The lobster (4 lobster tails halved) was overcooked, dry, stringy and bland and the calamari had a prominent fishiness to it. We utilized all 10 lemon wedges to add some moistness and to hide the unappetizing fishy flavor. \n\nTAPAS: Serving size per a tapa was 2-3 people so we ordered 2 orders for some dishes.\n\n*2 JAMON SERRANO - Cured Ham on French Bread ($6) SIMPLY DELICIOUS! Crusty bread topped w/ a salty and fatty slice of ham w/ thick slices of tomatoes for sweetness and tang.\n\n*2 PATAS BRAVAS -Spicy Potatoes ($4.50): YUMMY! The potatoes had a super crisp exterior w/ a pillowly soft interior. The spicy aioli was rich and creamy w/ nice kick of heat.\n\n*2 CROQUETAS DE POLLA - Chicken Croquettes ($5): SAVORY & COMFORTING! The croquettes were fried to a golden brown w/ an extra crisp crust and filled w/ a savory creamed chicken mixture. The accompanying creamed spinach sauce added a tangy zip and an extra layer of richness.\n\n*CALAMARES A LA PANCHA - Grilled Calamari ($6.75): GOOD! The calamari was perfectly grilled to a sweet tenderness and was flavorful w/ a subtle smokiness.\n\n*MEJILLONES A LA PLACHA - Grilled Mussels ($7): GOOD! The sweet and tender mussels were bathing in a savory and rich broth w/ herbaceous notes brightened w/ the splash of lemons. Our complimentary crusty bread was perfect for dunking and soaking up all the brothy goodness.\n\n*GAMBAS AJILLO SHRIMP - Garlic Shrimp ($7): GARLICKY GOODNESS! The tender and sweet shrimp albeit small were bathing in garlic sauce which was buttery, robust and full of bold garlicky flavor.\n\n*RABO TORO - Oxtail Stew ($7): COMFORTING! The oxtail was fall-off-the-bone tender and was in a rich and savory broth. The broth had a depth of flavor as if the oxtails, veggies and herbs had been simmering for hours.\n\n*ROPA VIEJO - Beef, Chicken & Chorizo Stew ($5.50): OK. The beef and chicken were dry and there was a lack of chorizo to give the stew a rich and smoky flavor.\n\n*CHAMPINONES AL AJILLO - Mushroom w/ Garlic ($5.25): DELISH! The mushrooms were tender and meaty w/ a distinct garlic flavor that wasn't overwhelming and sprinkles of parsley for a pop of freshness.\n\n*ASPARAGUS A LA PLANCHA - Grilled Asparagus Ala Plancha ($5.25): PERFECTLY COOKED! The large spears were vibrant green and tender, yet had the crisp al-dente bite to it. The spicy aioli gave it a layer of creaminess w/ a slight kick and the lemons a citrus punch.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was friendly, down-to-earth and attentive. \n\nOur food came out quickly w/ only a 5 min wait for our first dish while the others quickly followed suit.  The paella took the longest at about 30 mins.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nRustic and casual Spanish feel w/ bright yellow, red and pink hues, country wood tables and chairs, Spanish abstract art and tchotchkes. It's  very lively especially when the Mariachi Band makes its rounds so it's a fun atmosphere for groups.    \n\nP A R K I N G:\nDifficult street parking, however, there's a parking garage on 2 blocks away on 21st/Valencia. \n\nEsperpento is a good alternative to Cha Cha Cha w/ very solid dishes full of vibrant flavors.

We were still hungry after that (there were three of us) so, some anchovies in oil with lemon - not a fan of anchovies but I did try them (they weren't as fishy as they usually are), some Ropa Viejo, and some Champinones Al Ajillo found their way to our table.

A million times yes!\n\nI went here last week for my birthday, and felt totally blessed things worked out the way they did. Last Saturday I was totally frustrated and still kicking myself in the ass for not planning my dinner more than 4 hours before dinner was scheduled. I called Esperpento earlier to see if they had anything open, to which they replied it would be infinitely impossible to acquiesce my request. Well, they actually said it was \"too late for reservations\" but I had to throw some big word usage on ya ass! Ya know you need it.\n\nYet right before leaving for a delectable dining experience at Friday's (yes, I was that desperate), a voice in my head told me to call Esperpento one last time. Don't worry, it wasn't the scurry *kill your Mother* type voice - more like an intuitive, calling from God, conscience type. So I called to see if they had any tables open for a party of ten. The owner's son, who's totally cool, said he would hold the table for us until we got there. He didn't even ask us how long we'd be, he just said he'd hold it. SCORE! About an hour later we all arrived, the table still held for us even though there were others waiting to be seated.\n\nRight away we ordered the seafood paella (takes 30 minutes), sangria, and the fried calamari (the best ever!). Yup, we knew our stuff. Of all the patatas, the patatas bravas were the BEST. The grilled/fried calamari dishes were both perfectly seasoned, the Champinones Al Ajillo were delicious, and the HUGE grilled veggie salad was the perfect way to add more veggies to the two GIGANTIC meat platters  (carnes de pajarillas?). Just like NKOTB, we had all the Right Stuff - Three-Points!\n\nAnother SCORE, you ask? Being seated upstairs. This was perfect for us, since there wasn't as much room downstairs for my man to stumble around half-drunk, handing out extra birthday cake to lucky patrons. It felt like I had the best of everything that night - food, companionship, laughter, and love.\n\nThe only complaint? I went here two months ago for Valentine's and noticed they jacked all tapas prices up by a dollar/two.\n\ne.g. Patatas bravas/alioli $4.50 then, $5.75 now\n       Calamares fritos $6 then, 7.75 now\n\nStill, I would definitely return to Esperpento any time!

Yes, Esperpento lets this Mariachi band in to play music (per some of the regular patrons). Free entertainment for the restaurant. I don't mind them playing music, but when it's blaring right next to my ears and raining spit while I'm eating....that's when I get irritated.

It turned out to be a disappointing dish, not worth the wait.\n\nThe lobster tails were overcooked & dry. It was funny to see some of us fighting to get the meat out from the shell, it was pretty tough & stringy! \n\nThe calamari was thin, it's like chewing on rubber bands.

The 'socarrat' is what I look forward to in a well-made paella. It's the crusty-crunchy rice layer that forms at the bottom of the pan, where all the flavors of the ingredients are the most concentrated. This is only possible when the pan is cooked over very high heat or an open fire. Cooking in an oven will only give you soggy risotto like this:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=qRbH0Pxi8M67mihOp63fjQ\n\nI didn't get a saffron kick at all.

Everyone elses impression was mixed. they either hated it or loved it. \nGrilled quail - didn't eat it but heard it was good. really small though. But i guess that's a quail for you.\nGarlic shrimp - didn't eat it but one of the highlights for the meat eaters. They asked for more bread just to finish the sauce off. \nVeggie Paella - I thought it was alright. Not disappointed at all, tho. It depended on what mixture of veggies ended up in my mouth.  I did not care for whatever bean was in there (i think a lima) and that tended to throw off the flavor of everything else. \nMeat and Seafood Paella - I thought this was weird - the meat eaters HATED this but they LOVED the veggie paella. Go figure. \n\nThe environment was lively.  Good mixture of characters.  It wasn't too loud that I couldn't hear people. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive. The only issue was that they came out with the mushrooms after most of the other items were finished.

Other Yelpers have raved about Esperpento's paella but that night our paella was a complete fail. \n\nRICE: The rice was firm but had a creamy risotto like consistency (not dry and separate the way it should be). It was flavorful and had soaked up all the liquids and aromatics (i.e. onions, garlic, saffron and other herbs) but it also had an off putting fishiness to it.\n\nSOCARRAT: Perhaps the heating source wasn't sufficient or the incorrect pan was used, but the paella lacked the golden caramelized bottom crust which is quintessential to a good paella.  \n\nTOPPINGS: The lobster (4 lobster tails halved) was overcooked, dry, stringy and bland and the calamari had a prominent fishiness to it. We utilized all 10 lemon wedges to add some moistness and to hide the unappetizing fishy flavor. \n\nTAPAS: Serving size per a tapa was 2-3 people so we ordered 2 orders for some dishes.\n\n*2 JAMON SERRANO - Cured Ham on French Bread ($6) SIMPLY DELICIOUS! Crusty bread topped w/ a salty and fatty slice of ham w/ thick slices of tomatoes for sweetness and tang.\n\n*2 PATAS BRAVAS -Spicy Potatoes ($4.50): YUMMY! The potatoes had a super crisp exterior w/ a pillowly soft interior. The spicy aioli was rich and creamy w/ nice kick of heat.\n\n*2 CROQUETAS DE POLLA - Chicken Croquettes ($5): SAVORY & COMFORTING! The croquettes were fried to a golden brown w/ an extra crisp crust and filled w/ a savory creamed chicken mixture. The accompanying creamed spinach sauce added a tangy zip and an extra layer of richness.\n\n*CALAMARES A LA PANCHA - Grilled Calamari ($6.75): GOOD! The calamari was perfectly grilled to a sweet tenderness and was flavorful w/ a subtle smokiness.\n\n*MEJILLONES A LA PLACHA - Grilled Mussels ($7): GOOD! The sweet and tender mussels were bathing in a savory and rich broth w/ herbaceous notes brightened w/ the splash of lemons. Our complimentary crusty bread was perfect for dunking and soaking up all the brothy goodness.\n\n*GAMBAS AJILLO SHRIMP - Garlic Shrimp ($7): GARLICKY GOODNESS! The tender and sweet shrimp albeit small were bathing in garlic sauce which was buttery, robust and full of bold garlicky flavor.\n\n*RABO TORO - Oxtail Stew ($7): COMFORTING! The oxtail was fall-off-the-bone tender and was in a rich and savory broth. The broth had a depth of flavor as if the oxtails, veggies and herbs had been simmering for hours.\n\n*ROPA VIEJO - Beef, Chicken & Chorizo Stew ($5.50): OK. The beef and chicken were dry and there was a lack of chorizo to give the stew a rich and smoky flavor.\n\n*CHAMPINONES AL AJILLO - Mushroom w/ Garlic ($5.25): DELISH!

It started off great because the table I reserved was immediately ready for us when we arrived.

Here is the breakdown of my impression of the dishes:\nTortilla de patata - meh. Typical spanish omelet. I always thought these would be so much better if it with some type of sauce\nPatats bravas - really good. \nChampinones Al Ajilio (mushrooms) - the best option! very flavorful\nAsparagus ala plancha - good flavor. Tangy flavor\nAlcachofas  a la plancha (grilled artichokes) - ugh. Not my favorite. Then again i was never a fan of artichokes. Everyone elses impression was mixed. they either hated it or loved it. \nGrilled quail - didn't eat it but heard it was good. really small though. But i guess that's a quail for you.\nGarlic shrimp - didn't eat it but one of the highlights for the meat eaters. They asked for more bread just to finish the sauce off. \nVeggie Paella - I thought it was alright. Not disappointed at all, tho. It depended on what mixture of veggies ended up in my mouth.  I did not care for whatever bean was in there (i think a lima) and that tended to throw off the flavor of everything else. \nMeat and Seafood Paella - I thought this was weird - the meat eaters HATED this but they LOVED the veggie paella. Go figure. \n\nThe environment was lively.  Good mixture of characters.  It wasn't too loud that I couldn't hear people. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive. The only issue was that they came out with the mushrooms after most of the other items were finished.  With large parties I am forgiving on things like that.  \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this place.

Great.\nAfter about 15 minutes and extensive item suggestions between ourselves, we finally have some idea on what we want.\nActually we didn't, but I thought we did.\nSo, on the fly this is what we got:\n\nTortilla De Patata - potato and onion omelet (basic tortilla Espagnol),\nthe potatoes were nice and soft and the eggs were velvety,moist and soft.

One of my favorite types of food in the world is mushrooms (any kind, really) but it's gotta be sauteed. Mm. It's pretty basic and simple. These were very good. The mushroom were fairly large and very plump.\nGambas Al Ajillo- garlic shrimp. Lots of garlic and delicious. Although I felt that the shrimp was a bit on the small size. Hah! \nPollo Adobo - spicy exotic chicken. Huh? They serve Filipino food? Nah, this was cooked a lot differently. There was a lot of garlic in this dish as well and I think it was sauteed in red wine and maybe a little sherry. Of course there was some other spices in it. It was really good, but not what I was expecting. Hm?\nWe got a side of rice that was probably cooked with some kind of stock (chicken?) and there were some vegetables, herbs and spices.

This is your dish. Oh yeah! It's on.\n\nNeedless to say. Once again we ordered more food than was possible to consume. But dammit. We gave it our best shot.\n\nOk. So here's what I figured out.\nOne. Garlic and salt. That is what was laking in the foods in Barcelona. Not that it didn't have any, but that it didn't have enough. Or what I would have preferred.\nTwo. Esperpento rocks.\nNow two things I didn't like about Esperpento.\nOne. Minuscule beer list. Aw. Hey Esperpento folks. Beer is good. Lot's of beer to chose  from is better.\nTwo. Frozen steak. Yuck.

Ok, let's see if they are good to their word.  Arrived at said place, a few minutes before our rsvp time.  Gave them my name, kind greeter (?) acknowledges our reservation, offers us a drink (heck yea - sangria please), and asked us to wait a few minutes while they get our table set up.  Took roughly 5 painful minutes before we were seated.  Now, other establishments would not seat us until all parties were present.  Not so with this place.  They seated us peeps that were present, while we waited for others.  In the meantime, while multitasking (read: wait and read menu) - we decided to order a few tapas to get the night started.

Right mixture of fruits and wine, but careful..keep drinking that stuff and you'll be wobbling out of the restaurant.  It's a creeper, that one!  \n\nTapas: Pollo Al Ajillo (garlic chicken), Croquetas De Pollo (chicken croquettes), Albondigas (meat-balls stew with saffron), Rabo Toro (Ox-Tail Stew), Pollo Adobo (Spicy Exotic Chicken), Calamares Fritos (fried calamari), Almejas A La Marinera (clams in spanish \" marinara \" sauce, with sauteed onions, garlic, parsley and white wine), and Mejillones A La Vinaigrette (steamed mussels in picaro's vinaigrette) - were the picks from menu for this hungry group.  Our favorites were the Ox Tail, the Chicken Croquettes, the calamari, and the meat balls with saffron.  Now, the other selections were good as well - but these were the stand outs.  Also note that the steamed mussels and clams, although nicely presented, were not \"meat-plentiful\" - so if you order this, don't expect to get \"bite-size chunks of seafood jewels\" not so with these dishes.\n\nWe also ordered the seafood paella.  Now, I've had paella, and so the expectations were high.  With that said, although this dish was spectacular in presentation with assortment of (large) shrimps, mussels (small), clams (small) red peppers, peas etc - and the flavor was good.  The biggest question stood out.  WHERE WAS THE SOCCARAT?!  \n\nOverall - I'd rate this a 3.5 - with a creeping 4, solely because they seated us right away, the price point with the food, the tasty eats - not to mention -  a parking garage conveniently located 1 block from the restaurant (on 21st street).

But we didn't make a reservation anywhere because we just wanted to wing it. Unfortunately, our first choice, a restaurant a couple blocks away, was completely packed, and the wait was going to be 1.5 hours. So we stumbled on this place by accident. And what a wonderful accident it was! There was only a very short wait (like ten minutes) for a table of four on a busy Saturday night.\n\nTo start, I recommend the Sangria - not the glass, the pitcher. At first, I thought there was not enough fruit or alcohol. But I simply asked for more fruit, which they brought out in a bowl, and believe me, there was definitely alcohol in there, which will sneak up on you if you're not careful.\n\nFor tapas, we ordered the Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp). It was probably my favorite dish of the night! Juicy shrimp in a warm garlic sauce that is actually perfect for dipping the bread that they bring you. We also had the Croquetas de Pollo (Chicken Croquettes). Normally, I'm not a fan of croquettes, but these just melted in my mouth, and the sauce was amazing as well. Finally, we had the Patatas Aioli (Garlic Mayonnaise Potatoes), which they mistakenly thought was Patatas Bravas (Spicy Potatoes), so we actually got to try both.\n\nFor our entree, we ordered the Paella de Mariscos for two. There was a bit of a wait for it, but it was well worth the wait! Seasoning was absolutely perfect, and they were very generous with the seafood. The only downside was that we couldn't finish it in one go, so we had to take it home and of course it wasn't as good the next day.\n\nAll of the food was reasonably priced. The restaurant had a very authentic feel and we even had a small band come around the tables and play at one point during the meal. Also, our server was very warm and friendly. He did mess up a couple of our orders, and it took a while for things like drink refills, but we still loved it all.

Since they claim they are small plates, I usually order a butt load and don't feel bad eating that much b/c they are small plates/tapas. But in reality, you really end up eating a lot, getting drunk, and not even spending that much $$$ for what you get! \n\nAll the tapas range from 5-7 dollars and can be shared between a big group. They aren't the biggest portions, but you should be good with getting 1-2 plates (per every person in your table) and a paella to share. When ordering paella, their serving can feed twice the amount of people it is designated for. For example: a serving for 2 can serve 4 people and a serving for 4 can serve 6-8 unless you are super hungry or just order the paella.\n\nHere are some dish suggestions: \nGambas al Ajilo: Very tasty garlic sauce and the shrimp is so moist and flavorful. \nPatatas Bravas: Potatoes are well cooked and seasoned. \nRopa Viejo: The sauce could use a little more chorizo flavor, but the meat is on point. \nArtichokes: Very crispy and thinly sliced artichoke dish! Nothing special, but good veggie dish.\nFor Paella, the negro is super tasty but might not be for all people as the flavor is super distinct. And the paella de mariscos (which I usually get) is packed with seafood. If you want lobster, it's a little more expensive, but heard it's worth it! It is not the best paella but it is decent! \nAND DON'T FORGET THE SANGRIA : 17 FOR A PITCHER?

You have to be super pro active with one of the hosts to make sure you get seated at the proper time.

I realize this review is bit dated but as I was looking through my notes on my BB, I realized that I never wrote a review for Esperpento (Yes, I'm a nerd and take notes.) That night, we (party of 6) walked in w/o reservations at 6 PM and were seated upstairs w/ only a 2-3 min wait. We knew our table may not be large enough for all our food so we asked if we can add the empty table next to us to our table which our waiter was more than happy to oblige.\n\nF O O D / D R I N K S:\n*3 PITCHERS OF SANGRA ($17/ea): Smooth and full of fruity flavors and notes w/ a touch of an acidic bite. The bits of apple and oranges gave it an extra burst of sweetness. \n\n*PAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA - Lobster Paella (Serving for 4 - $50): DISAPPOINTING!!!\n\nI'm no Paella expert but I've had paella enough times and watch enough Food Network and Travel Channel to know the components that make a good paella. Other Yelpers have raved about Esperpento's paella but that night our paella was a complete fail. \n\nRICE: The rice was firm but had a creamy risotto like consistency (not dry and separate the way it should be). It was flavorful and had soaked up all the liquids and aromatics (i.e. onions, garlic, saffron and other herbs) but it also had an off putting fishiness to it.\n\nSOCARRAT: Perhaps the heating source wasn't sufficient or the incorrect pan was used, but the paella lacked the golden caramelized bottom crust which is quintessential to a good paella.  \n\nTOPPINGS: The lobster (4 lobster tails halved) was overcooked, dry, stringy and bland and the calamari had a prominent fishiness to it. We utilized all 10 lemon wedges to add some moistness and to hide the unappetizing fishy flavor. \n\nTAPAS: Serving size per a tapa was 2-3 people so we ordered 2 orders for some dishes.\n\n*2 JAMON SERRANO - Cured Ham on French Bread ($6) SIMPLY DELICIOUS! Crusty bread topped w/ a salty and fatty slice of ham w/ thick slices of tomatoes for sweetness and tang.\n\n*2 PATAS BRAVAS -Spicy Potatoes ($4.50): YUMMY! The potatoes had a super crisp exterior w/ a pillowly soft interior. The spicy aioli was rich and creamy w/ nice kick of heat.\n\n*2 CROQUETAS DE POLLA - Chicken Croquettes ($5): SAVORY & COMFORTING! The croquettes were fried to a golden brown w/ an extra crisp crust and filled w/ a savory creamed chicken mixture. The accompanying creamed spinach sauce added a tangy zip and an extra layer of richness.\n\n*CALAMARES A LA PANCHA - Grilled Calamari ($6.75): GOOD! The calamari was perfectly grilled to a sweet tenderness and was flavorful w/ a subtle smokiness.\n\n*MEJILLONES A LA PLACHA - Grilled Mussels ($7): GOOD! The sweet and tender mussels were bathing in a savory and rich broth w/ herbaceous notes brightened w/ the splash of lemons. Our complimentary crusty bread was perfect for dunking and soaking up all the brothy goodness.\n\n*GAMBAS AJILLO SHRIMP - Garlic Shrimp ($7): GARLICKY GOODNESS! The tender and sweet shrimp albeit small were bathing in garlic sauce which was buttery, robust and full of bold garlicky flavor.\n\n*RABO TORO - Oxtail Stew ($7): COMFORTING! The oxtail was fall-off-the-bone tender and was in a rich and savory broth. The broth had a depth of flavor as if the oxtails, veggies and herbs had been simmering for hours.\n\n*ROPA VIEJO - Beef, Chicken & Chorizo Stew ($5.50): OK. The beef and chicken were dry and there was a lack of chorizo to give the stew a rich and smoky flavor.\n\n*CHAMPINONES AL AJILLO - Mushroom w/ Garlic ($5.25): DELISH! The mushrooms were tender and meaty w/ a distinct garlic flavor that wasn't overwhelming and sprinkles of parsley for a pop of freshness.\n\n*ASPARAGUS A LA PLANCHA - Grilled Asparagus Ala Plancha ($5.25): PERFECTLY COOKED! The large spears were vibrant green and tender, yet had the crisp al-dente bite to it. The spicy aioli gave it a layer of creaminess w/ a slight kick and the lemons a citrus punch.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was friendly, down-to-earth and attentive. \n\nOur food came out quickly w/ only a 5 min wait for our first dish while the others quickly followed suit.  The paella took the longest at about 30 mins.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nRustic and casual Spanish feel w/ bright yellow, red and pink hues, country wood tables and chairs, Spanish abstract art and tchotchkes.

Instead we ordered some tapas:\n\nGambas ala plancha - grilled jumbo shrimps - well not quite jumbo but they were yummy.\n\nCazuela de pescado con almejas - snapper and clams cooked in spanish sauce/tomato sauce - very tasty as well and the goes well with the free bread they give you.\n\nJamon Serrano canape - lovely as well, but I suppose it's my least fave of the things we ordered.  \n\nPatatas Bravas - one cannot go to a tapa place without checking out the patatas bravas right?  I like the aioli, although I'd prefer the potatoes to be cute a little larger.  This one's yummy.\n\nEscalivada - roasted eggplant , peppers and onion - really good.  A new one for me. Never seen it in other tapas place before.\n\nEstofado de Conejo - stewed rabbit - boy it does taste like chicken, truly I tell you.  I really enjoyed this dish.\n\nWith a bottle of Barcelona beer and a glass of sangria our bill came to about $50 dollars.

I realize this review is bit dated but as I was looking through my notes on my BB, I realized that I never wrote a review for Esperpento (Yes, I'm a nerd and take notes.) That night, we (party of 6) walked in w/o reservations at 6 PM and were seated upstairs w/ only a 2-3 min wait. We knew our table may not be large enough for all our food so we asked if we can add the empty table next to us to our table which our waiter was more than happy to oblige.\n\nF O O D / D R I N K S:\n*3 PITCHERS OF SANGRA ($17/ea): Smooth and full of fruity flavors and notes w/ a touch of an acidic bite. The bits of apple and oranges gave it an extra burst of sweetness. \n\n*PAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA - Lobster Paella (Serving for 4 - $50): DISAPPOINTING!!!\n\nI'm no Paella expert but I've had paella enough times and watch enough Food Network and Travel Channel to know the components that make a good paella. Other Yelpers have raved about Esperpento's paella but that night our paella was a complete fail. \n\nRICE: The rice was firm but had a creamy risotto like consistency (not dry and separate the way it should be). It was flavorful and had soaked up all the liquids and aromatics (i.e. onions, garlic, saffron and other herbs) but it also had an off putting fishiness to it.\n\nSOCARRAT: Perhaps the heating source wasn't sufficient or the incorrect pan was used, but the paella lacked the golden caramelized bottom crust which is quintessential to a good paella.  \n\nTOPPINGS: The lobster (4 lobster tails halved) was overcooked, dry, stringy and bland and the calamari had a prominent fishiness to it. We utilized all 10 lemon wedges to add some moistness and to hide the unappetizing fishy flavor. \n\nTAPAS: Serving size per a tapa was 2-3 people so we ordered 2 orders for some dishes.\n\n*2 JAMON SERRANO - Cured Ham on French Bread ($6) SIMPLY DELICIOUS! Crusty bread topped w/ a salty and fatty slice of ham w/ thick slices of tomatoes for sweetness and tang.\n\n*2 PATAS BRAVAS -Spicy Potatoes ($4.50): YUMMY! The potatoes had a super crisp exterior w/ a pillowly soft interior. The spicy aioli was rich and creamy w/ nice kick of heat.\n\n*2 CROQUETAS DE POLLA - Chicken Croquettes ($5): SAVORY & COMFORTING! The croquettes were fried to a golden brown w/ an extra crisp crust and filled w/ a savory creamed chicken mixture. The accompanying creamed spinach sauce added a tangy zip and an extra layer of richness.\n\n*CALAMARES A LA PANCHA - Grilled Calamari ($6.75): GOOD! The calamari was perfectly grilled to a sweet tenderness and was flavorful w/ a subtle smokiness.\n\n*MEJILLONES A LA PLACHA - Grilled Mussels ($7): GOOD! The sweet and tender mussels were bathing in a savory and rich broth w/ herbaceous notes brightened w/ the splash of lemons. Our complimentary crusty bread was perfect for dunking and soaking up all the brothy goodness.\n\n*GAMBAS AJILLO SHRIMP - Garlic Shrimp ($7): GARLICKY GOODNESS! The tender and sweet shrimp albeit small were bathing in garlic sauce which was buttery, robust and full of bold garlicky flavor.\n\n*RABO TORO - Oxtail Stew ($7): COMFORTING! The oxtail was fall-off-the-bone tender and was in a rich and savory broth. The broth had a depth of flavor as if the oxtails, veggies and herbs had been simmering for hours.\n\n*ROPA VIEJO - Beef, Chicken & Chorizo Stew ($5.50): OK. The beef and chicken were dry and there was a lack of chorizo to give the stew a rich and smoky flavor.\n\n*CHAMPINONES AL AJILLO - Mushroom w/ Garlic ($5.25): DELISH! The mushrooms were tender and meaty w/ a distinct garlic flavor that wasn't overwhelming and sprinkles of parsley for a pop of freshness.\n\n*ASPARAGUS A LA PLANCHA - Grilled Asparagus Ala Plancha ($5.25): PERFECTLY COOKED! The large spears were vibrant green and tender, yet had the crisp al-dente bite to it. The spicy aioli gave it a layer of creaminess w/ a slight kick and the lemons a citrus punch.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was friendly, down-to-earth and attentive. \n\nOur food came out quickly w/ only a 5 min wait for our first dish while the others quickly followed suit.  The paella took the longest at about 30 mins.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nRustic and casual Spanish feel w/ bright yellow, red and pink hues, country wood tables and chairs, Spanish abstract art and tchotchkes.

Gave them my name, kind greeter (?) acknowledges our reservation, offers us a drink (heck yea - sangria please), and asked us to wait a few minutes while they get our table set up.  Took roughly 5 painful minutes before we were seated.  Now, other establishments would not seat us until all parties were present.  Not so with this place.  They seated us peeps that were present, while we waited for others.  In the meantime, while multitasking (read: wait and read menu) - we decided to order a few tapas to get the night started.

Also note that the steamed mussels and clams, although nicely presented, were not \"meat-plentiful\" - so if you order this, don't expect to get \"bite-size chunks of seafood jewels\" not so with these dishes.\n\nWe also ordered the seafood paella.  Now, I've had paella, and so the expectations were high.  With that said, although this dish was spectacular in presentation with assortment of (large) shrimps, mussels (small), clams (small) red peppers, peas etc - and the flavor was good.  The biggest question stood out.  WHERE WAS THE SOCCARAT?!  \n\nOverall - I'd rate this a 3.5 - with a creeping 4, solely because they seated us right away, the price point with the food, the tasty eats - not to mention -  a parking garage conveniently located 1 block from the restaurant (on 21st street).

The sauces from both dishes were fantastic for bread dipping, and one can never leave here without trying their delightful sangria which was a major hit.\n\nI really wanted to try their Lobster Paella for the longest time ($50).  It came with seven half pieces of juicy lobster tails with large calamari rings, shrimps and clams to induce an aromatic lobster seafood flavor which was steeped into the rice.

You will be greatly disappointed.\n\n- When you order your tapas, don't expect there to be one for everyone, it usually comes as a lump item that you divvy up.\n\n- Don't expect traditional tapas (for better of for worse).

The lemon definitely balances out the flavor, but I didn't think it should've been as salty as it was.\n\nService here is good. Our server/waiter was very polite.  She even exchanged my dollar bills for quarters for the parking meter. Which reminds me, parking around this area kinda sucks.  We found a meter (1 hour limit) that was about a block away.

One of my favorite types of food in the world is mushrooms (any kind, really) but it's gotta be sauteed. Mm. It's pretty basic and simple. These were very good. The mushroom were fairly large and very plump.\nGambas Al Ajillo- garlic shrimp. Lots of garlic and delicious. Although I felt that the shrimp was a bit on the small size. Hah! \nPollo Adobo - spicy exotic chicken. Huh? They serve Filipino food? Nah, this was cooked a lot differently. There was a lot of garlic in this dish as well and I think it was sauteed in red wine and maybe a little sherry. Of course there was some other spices in it. It was really good, but not what I was expecting. Hm?\nWe got a side of rice that was probably cooked with some kind of stock (chicken?) and there were some vegetables, herbs and spices. Again, simple and delicious.\nAnd for the piece de la resistance(insert trumpets here), we ordered the:\nParrillada De Carne - a montain o' grilled meats!  Chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage. hell yeah!), and some other sausage(which tasted like my most favorite of meats: spam!), grilled chicken, pork kebabs and carne asada (skirt steak?) on a bed of what might have either grilled or baked potatoes, topped with grilled red and green onions. \nFellow carnivores. This is your dish. Oh yeah! It's on.\n\nNeedless to say. Once again we ordered more food than was possible to consume. But dammit. We gave it our best shot.\n\nOk. So here's what I figured out.\nOne. Garlic and salt. That is what was laking in the foods in Barcelona. Not that it didn't have any, but that it didn't have enough. Or what I would have preferred.\nTwo. Esperpento rocks.\nNow two things I didn't like about Esperpento.\nOne. Minuscule beer list. Aw. Hey Esperpento folks. Beer is good. Lot's of beer to chose  from is better.\nTwo. Frozen steak. Yuck. Please don't freeze meat for too long.\nIt fucks up the color, taste and texture. 2-3 days at most. Or, get higher quality beef.

My first experience in '97 was the jam.  Maybe, cuz dotcom frenzy was in its ascendency, it's the painkillers talking, but People, I've been to Spain and this is pretty authentic.  This is not to say it's excellent cuisine-- this is not Zarzuela or Bocadillos or Bar Cerveceria!  This is olive oil and garlic laden (don't come if you no like), cheap Spanish (&Filipino) beer, yummy, homey Spanish food.  This is not microgreens or organic poultry or artisinal anything so get over yourself. (I recommend Bar Cesar in Berkeley for that genre of tapas.)\r\nTonight's meal:\r\n- Pollo Adobo (not my father's, but he's Illocano); chix was slightly arid, but the sauce is tasty-- not too spicy\r\n- Gambas Ajillo (not Mexican though the chef probably is); the shrimp are too small to carry off the strong flavor of this dish, but they've made the right choice with peeling the body and leaving the tail on--  \r\n- Patatas Bravas (not as good as ChaChaCha); they're not crispy enough.  I suspect in 1997 they were being deep friend and now they resemble Squat and Gobble homefries, but this is a standby tapa to help counteract the grease of...\r\n- Chorizo (weird little sausages); I like Mexican Chorizo and this amazing Chorizo Bilbao sold at Bi-Rite and Lucca, but I don't know what the hell this is.

I had the Calamari Fritti once, and I was embarassed for the chef.  Can you do more than dredge sub-par calamari in flour and panfry (I'm not 100% sure this was the method but it sure tasted like it)??

"], "author": "Kione E.", "review": "Ok.\nI just returned from a one month trip of Europe and  I spent 8 days in Barcelon~Catalunya Spain, so you'd think that I'd had my fill of Spanish tapas.\nHell no. You see, the thing is that I wasn't at all that impressed with the tapas in Spain. Maybe, it was the establishments that we went to, but I thought that couldn't have been it, because every tapas restaurant that we ate at, was super crowded  and at one place we had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a table. I couldn't figure it out.\nWhy was the tapas in Spain just ok?\nNow, I'm here in the Bay Area for a few days of recovery and decompression from a 24hrs + transition from France via London.\nAnd, my friends wanted to hang out and have dinner before I head down to SoCal and get back to reality.\nJC gave us 3 places to chose from where she's eaten before and it was in the area where she lives.\nPretty convenient. Cool.\nEsperento was one of them.\nFunny thing though, we actually decided on Thai food.\nWe get to Osha and there are about 20 empty seats and about 2 tables of 4 tops paying their bills, and the hostess/waitress says that their booked for reservations. And there was only 3 of us. What-ever!\nSo we decide Indian. Dosa. Line out the door. Oh man.\nNext!\nEsperpento it is.\nCool.\nWe get there and there are only about 4 parties ( about a dozen or so peoples). I usually consider and empty restaurant  on a busy avenue a bad thing. But at this point I didn't care. I was hungry.\nWe walk in and we're promptly and politely greeted by a gorgeous Latina, and we're sat at a perfect size table, right by the window.\nNice. Thanks you.\nThe menus is quite extensive and worn out. (good sign)\nOh man. Paella extravaganza and SO many variable of tapas to pick and chose and combine to create a feast of your fancy.\nVery very nice.\nNot too many beers to chose from. Sad. They were out of Negro Modelo (one of the 3 beers they had to chose from) so i settled for and Anchor Steam. Mm. Great.\nAfter about 15 minutes and extensive item suggestions between ourselves, we finally have some idea on what we want.\nActually we didn't, but I thought we did.\nSo, on the fly this is what we got:\n\nTortilla De Patata - potato and onion omelet (basic tortilla Espagnol),\nthe potatoes were nice and soft and the eggs were velvety,moist and soft. And what ever that creme fraiche like sauce was? It made the dish even more delicious.\nChampinon Al Ajillo - mushrooms saluteed with garlic. One of my favorite types of food in the world is mushrooms (any kind, really) but it's gotta be sauteed. Mm. It's pretty basic and simple. These were very good. The mushroom were fairly large and very plump.\nGambas Al Ajillo- garlic shrimp. Lots of garlic and delicious. Although I felt that the shrimp was a bit on the small size. Hah! \nPollo Adobo - spicy exotic chicken. Huh? They serve Filipino food? Nah, this was cooked a lot differently. There was a lot of garlic in this dish as well and I think it was sauteed in red wine and maybe a little sherry. Of course there was some other spices in it. It was really good, but not what I was expecting. Hm?\nWe got a side of rice that was probably cooked with some kind of stock (chicken?) and there were some vegetables, herbs and spices. Again, simple and delicious.\nAnd for the piece de la resistance(insert trumpets here), we ordered the:\nParrillada De Carne - a montain o' grilled meats!  Chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage. hell yeah!), and some other sausage(which tasted like my most favorite of meats: spam!), grilled chicken, pork kebabs and carne asada (skirt steak?) on a bed of what might have either grilled or baked potatoes, topped with grilled red and green onions. \nFellow carnivores. This is your dish. Oh yeah! It's on.\n\nNeedless to say. Once again we ordered more food than was possible to consume. But dammit. We gave it our best shot.\n\nOk. So here's what I figured out.\nOne. Garlic and salt. That is what was laking in the foods in Barcelona. Not that it didn't have any, but that it didn't have enough. Or what I would have preferred.\nTwo. Esperpento rocks.\nNow two things I didn't like about Esperpento.\nOne. Minuscule beer list. Aw. Hey Esperpento folks. Beer is good. Lot's of beer to chose  from is better.\nTwo. Frozen steak. Yuck. Please don't freeze meat for too long.\nIt fucks up the color, taste and texture. 2-3 days at most. Or, get higher quality beef. You can up the price on the menu if you have to.\nI feel people won't mind paying a little extra if the quality is well worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, relaxed, comfortable and still a bit lively.\nThe service is great. Our server was attentive, but not intrusive.\nAnd the over all quality of the food is pretty freakin' good.\nThe bill was the most impressive part.

Sometimes they have people (street performers) that come in from the streets with their guitars and start playing music all around the restaurant. You can tip them if you like but you are not required to do so. My only complaint (and I do not complain often) is that it's a pretty small establishment. The tables are small and they are not even that they rock back and forth. Lol.. Friday and Saturday nights get really packed so arrive early or call and make a reso!

The only downside was that it was too late to order paella.\n\nWe ordered a whole bunch of tapas dishes and literally everything we ate was amazing.  Let's do a play by play so you can really understand how good it was.  First, bread and a spicy aioli sauce to dip in.  Simple but really really good, even after we got our food, we asked for more bread and dip.  The sauces in all the seafood plates are highly dippable and the spicy dip is highly spreadable on anything.\n\nNext was grilled clams in olive oil and parsley.  We couldn't decide between the clams with marinara sauce or olive oil and the waiter suggested the olive oil.  The sauce was ridiculously flavorful.  If everything else weren't so good, I would've been content to eat a whole plate of bread dipped in that sauce.\n\nJamon Serrano.  What to say here?  It's salty cured meat on a piece of toast.  What is there not to like?  We had also ordered anchovies, so slap one of those on top of the jamon and slather some of that spicy dip and it's even better.\n\nOxtail stew was savory and comforting.  The chunks of meat were so tender, they fell right off the bone.\n\nGrilled quail with rosemary potatoes.  The skin was perfectly crisp and the flavor was on point.  The potatoes were also the bomb diggity, exploding with flavor.\n\nGrilled artichoke was one of my favorites.  The pieces are sliced through the whole artichoke, not just the heart, so you can see the layers of leaves.  The grill flavor was wonderful.  I have never seen this before and will probably order this over and over again.\n\nGrilled scallops came with three large pieces on a skewer with yellow rice.  The flavor was good but the portion was a little skimpy.\n\nAll in all, we were totally stuffed.  Did we over order in a panic that the kitchen was going to close?  Maybe.  Do we regret it?  Not one bit.  The service was great and not once did we feel rushed.  The kitchen closed at their stated closing time but all the other patrons in the restaurant continued to hang out and enjoy their wine.\n\nThis is the best tapas I've had since eating in Spain and most of the dishes are very reasonable priced.

Here is the breakdown of my impression of the dishes:\nTortilla de patata - meh. Typical spanish omelet.

Tangy flavor\nAlcachofas  a la plancha (grilled artichokes) - ugh. Not my favorite. Then again i was never a fan of artichokes.

Go figure. \n\nThe environment was lively.  Good mixture of characters.  It wasn't too loud that I couldn't hear people. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive. The only issue was that they came out with the mushrooms after most of the other items were finished.

The best of modern Spanish cinema. \n\nYou always get a basket of bread and butter to start with. That alone is so comforting and good. I usually go through about 2 baskets per meal. \n\nDuring happy hour, you get a great deal on their awesome pitchers of Sangria. Tastes like juice but you get a nice buzz after one glass. \n\nThere are so many great appetizers (tapas) to choose from. I usually get the grilled asparagus w lemon cream, grilled garlic mushrooms, garlic prawns, little Spanish chorizos, crunchy cabbage, and the creamy spicy potatoes (patatas bravas). \n\nIf you've got time and an appetite, order a Paella. It's a saffron rice casserole topped with different meats or vegetables enough for 2-8 people depending on the size. It takes about 30 minutes to make. \n\nMy favorite one is the Matanzas which has chicken, pork, and sausage.

Made reservations, but when we arrived there were quite a few empty tables. We had to wait a anyway since it seemed no one was paying attention. \n\nThe first thing that threw me off beside the dirty menu I was handed was the extremely loud Mexican band making the rounds. Having grown up listening to this type of music, I usually don't mind it, but they were pretty bad, and they felt the need to hang around the table that was right next to us all night. It made it nearly impossible to have a conversation. One of the guitar players was so close I was afraid he was going to hit me in back of the head with his guitar!  \n\nI ordered a Verdejo and my date ordered a Sangria. Not once were we asked if we would like a second glass or a refill of water. We also ordered a variety of tapas to share. Disappointed with some of them. \n\nPatatas Bravas- pretty good, but the sauce on it seemed mayo based. Perfect spice, but not what the sauce is traditionally made of. \n\nGambas al Ajillo- again not authentic in our opinion. It seemed more like a shrimp scampi dish you would find at Olive Garden or someplace else. The sauce was okay for dipping, but not what you would find in Spain\n\nRabo de toro- extremely fatty. More fat on it than meat and the broth was just swimming with it as well. It had good flavor, but it reminded me more of a Mexican soup than a Spanish one. The spices used in it seem more in tune with a posole than Rabo de toro. Disappointing. I picked some meat off, but left the rest, including the greasy broth. \n\nAlbondigas- we had heard wonders about these, but I think they were my biggest disappointment. All you could taste was oregano!  It tasted like someone has accidentally dumped a load of it into the meat and left it as is. You couldn't taste anything else. Again, reminded me of Mexican cooking and not Spanish since that spice is not widely (or heavily) used in Spanish dishes.\n\nEscalivada- eggplant with peppers and onions. Well, it was suppose to have peppers, but we didn't really see any. Extremely greasy including the dish. So greasy that when we picked up the dish to move it, it slipped out of my bf's hands and landed on the table. \n\nTwo good things- the Croquetas de bacalao and the Crema Catalana. The croquettes were delicious and served with a yummy Spinach bechamel. The Crema Catalana is suppose to be similar to a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but better in my opinion. \n\nWith all this, it was pretty affordable, but not something we would go back to. While the croquettas were good, my boyfriend makes WAY better ones at home. I'll just save my cravings for his home cooking, or our yearly trip to Spain. \n\nTwo stars for the croquettas and dessert.  If I could give one and a half I would.

By 7pm the place was hoppin', between the people seated, the people waiting, the staff and the strolling musicians the evening's festivities had begun.

The fried calamari was excellent when dipped into their creamy house hot sauce. Now you know I had to try the blood sausage; it was very good but not exciting.\n\nFor the main dish we ordered the Lobster Paella for six. A Saffron-flavored Rice dish cooked with a gaggle of slipper Lobsters, Seafood and Vegetables served in a Paellera, $76. The server assured us that we had ordered enough since we had also ordered tapas and only had 6 adults in our group of 7. If you had asked my doctor he would have also told you that I had ordered more than enough but for a foodie it was only just enough.
