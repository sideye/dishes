But then I came here...and Bella has made me excited for good Italian food again! I've forgotten how good it can be.\n\nCame here on a double date last night after watching Book of Mormon in the city. (No, it's not close to the theater, sorry!) My boyfriend's friends recommended this place--one of their absolute favorites. And I can totally see why! Very romantic ambiance (a beautiful floor to ceiling painting of a night in Italy by the water) and dim-ish lighting with clear hanging lightbulbs. The restaurant is not big and not a looker from the outside, but the inside is cozy and cute! Reservations recommended. There were groups and couples and I can see how you might be pressed for space if u were a couple seated between other groups or couples, but the four of us got a table separate from everyone else. \n\nUnlimited bread and sundried tomato sauce (different from the usual sauces)! The bread is soft and goes great with the sauce, but I do wish it were a little warmed up. We started with appetizers: polentun a bella, guazetto, and salumi. \n\nThe polenta was baked polenta ($9.50) with gorgonzola and cremini mushrooms..be careful that it's really hot when it comes out! A good hearty appetizer that can hit the spot. But I'd say you'd have to like polenta. I'm not the BIGGEST fan of polenta because I tend to get sick of the texture or flavor or something after too much, but this was made well and I think the fact that there were mushrooms made it that much better. I may not order this again but try it!\n\nGuazetto ($16) was a yummy tomato bisque with zucchini, mussels, clams, calamari, and ours also had a fried tilapia on top..super DELISH with the sauce! I lovedddd this. And the bread does well in soaking up the soup. Would totally order this again!! Salami was okay but honestly I'm not good at critiquing cured meats so I'm gonna defer on that. I personally wouldn't order it on my own, but our friends say they always order it. \n\nI think our friends frequent so much that the owners know them and they sent over complimentary bruschetta! Quite yummy, lots of fresh basil and tomatoes soaked in vinegar topped with fresh mozzarella slices..and more sundried tomatoes. I think they really like sundried tomatoes here...haha\n\nFor Entrees, I got the butternut squash ravioli ($16) and my bf got the linguine with tiger prawns ($19). Our friends ordered sorrentino (gnocchi with sausage and mozzarella) and the lasagna. I loveddd the butter nut squash ravioli! It's kind of more sweet though...tastes like Thanksgiving candied yams wrapped in the dough and soaked in an olive oil, topped with browned butter fried sage and sundried tomatoes. The flavors form a real good mouthgasm. But...be warned, this only comes with 6 pieces. I wouldn't order this as your only entree. Luckily I was already really stuffed from all of our appetizers, that even finishing 6 raviolis was difficult for me...\n\nThe gnocchi were little pillows of goodness and the lasagna was not your typical doused in tomato sauce lasagna. The meat was clearly soaked in some kind of tomato essence though and I really liked the hearty flavors that didn't feel too rich at the same time. Nicely done! My bf was happy with his linguine with multiple giant shrimps. I thought it was decent, but honestly I think the only I didn't like from the night was his saffron bechamel sauce that seemed to have too much shrimpy flavors to it. Aside from that though, everything else was amazing!\n\nWe shared a panna cotta for dessert--fluffy and light yet rich and creamy. Not sure how THAT happens, but it was delicious. Even my super stuffed tummy had to make space for a few bites. It's not a big portion at $8, I have to say...but I think it was just right for the 4 of us. Oh, that and they also gave us complimentary spumoni. I'm not a huge spumoni fan, but I'll take free stuff! :P It was good, but I'd order the panna cotta over spumoni any day :D \n\nWonderful service and dining experience; great ambiance; delicious food!

Always ask for recommendations as the food varies from day to day.\n\nFor my visit on 9/9/2017 I ordered/received the following:\n\nBread (Free):\nI was initially disappointed with the bread that was provided with tomato and olive oil. It tasted stale like it should tossed 1-2 days ago. There was way too much olive oil and it masked the taste of the sun-dried tomatoes. The flavor of the sun-dried tomatoes were absolutely amazing, but was too subtle. I lacks a robust taste that would have complimented the bread well. They brought another serving of bread, but it was burnt. Extremely disappointed that they were willing to serve burnt bread.\n\nBone Marrow ($14):\nIt was decent for the price. It was way too under cooked. It did not compliment well with the toast provided, but was actually a lot better when eaten with the free bread. I recommend eating it with the free bread as it will help absorb the salt and fat to not overload your taste buds.\n\nPasta:\nMaccarun Ca Salsiccia ($16):\nCompared to the La Vera Carvonara, this ranks lower, but is still superb. I normally do not like peas, but it goes well with this dish. \n\nLa Vera Carbonara ($17):\nThis is the star of my visit. Most places that do a La Vera Carbonara wait too long before adding the egg causing it to be not so creamy, but they made this perfectly. The flavors mixed will together and they were able to create a rich, deep taste with only 3 ingredients. Would come back just to eat this.\n\nBruschetta Mozzarella: \nThis made up for the very lacking bread with tomatoes and olive oil. The bread was fresh and not overly toasted. It had the attention to detail I was expecting and the tomatoes had the robust flavor I was looking for. Mozzarella was subtle and helped the tomatoes shine by enhancing the taste.\n\nDessert Panna Cotta:\nThis was very well made and they let us end our meal strong. Most of these are usually made with too much gelatin but this was not the case. It had a good combination of gelatin and cream. Fruits were fresh and sweet. No real complaint for the dessert.\n\nOverall: The meal started of weak and was not going very good, but they stepped up their game at the pasta and it changed my bad experience to a good one. The chef afterwards went the extra mile by coming out and talking to all the customers who were still there.

I have dabbled a bit in amateur Italian cooking and I've learned that you can get a super creamy sauce with an egg & enough parmesan and/or pecorino. This was definitely super rich and creamy with a ton of cubed pancetta and cracked black pepper. The fettuccine noodles were cooked al dente. I was starting to get full from all the rich, heavy food, but I finished it because I couldn't stop eating it.\nWe also ordered a seafood pasta with mussels, clams, calamari, and a couple of scallops in a tomato sauce. That was very delicious too. \n\nWe were a little too full for dessert, but they brought us a complimentary panna cotta with sliced strawberries and blackberries, in some kind of strawberry sauce.

We made a reservation for 5:30pm on Wednesday and arrived at 5:25pm to the restaurant doors closed. This was very unusual, as the Yelp opening time said 5:15pm. We stood by the door and the employees inside could see that we were just a bit confused, so one of the employees came to open the door and acted somewhat shocked that we were surprised that they hadn't been open. He started telling us that they generally open by 5:30pm, but we notified him that they should adjust their Yelp so customers don't get confused when they arrive earlier. Nevertheless, we were the first ones there and were given the choice to sit wherever we pleased. Once we were seated, we were given the menus and served cold water and fresh bread with olive oil and sun dried tomatoes. \n\nWe proceeded to order two appetizers:\n\n1. Bruschetta Ca' Pummarola -- Crispy bread with olive oil with some freshly diced tomatoes and basil, topped with fresh mozzarella cheese. This was definitely a favorite of ours because it was extremely fresh and had you wanting more.\n2. Purpett' Della Mamma --Grilled meatballs in Eggplant-Tomato Caponata. This dish had great flavor and could definitely be ordered as a main course. There were a decent amount of meatballs, somewhere between 5-8. The veggies and sauce paired very well with the meatballs and the overall flavors were superb. \n\nMain Courses: \n2 of us ordered the La Vera Carbonara; which was hands down some of the best pasta that I've tried. It's really hard to impress me with a pasta dish, but I have to say, this dish did just that. It was really hard to believe that there was no butter or cream in this pasta, because it was VERY creamy and tasty. I'm not sure how it's prepared to taste this way, but it's definitely a must try.\nMy other friend had the Maccarun Ca Salsiccia, which was rigatoni pasta, with tomato cream sugo and Italian sausage with green peas. This pasta dish was overall tasty as well, but I wasn't as impressed as with the La Vera Carbonara, because I felt like there was too much of the tomato sauce, which I'm personally not a fan of. \n\nOnce we finished with our dinner, our server was nice enough to bring us Panna Cotta on the house. The Panna Cotta was very light and served with fresh cut fruits, making it very refreshing after our dinner. This was definitely a nice gesture after the initial encounter with the restaurant being closed when we arrived. I have to say that I was quite impressed with the entire meal.

We then ordered the Antipasto plate which comes with veggies, meat, cheese and olives. Since then we've tried the warm Spinach salad (I'm not wild about spinach...but this was very tasty) and the meatballs which also were good. \n\nFor dinner I had to laugh at the \"La Vera Carbonara\" which proudly states \"no cream, no butter\" because I completely agree - Carbonara is not alfredo with bacon! The \"cream\" quality is supposed to come from cooking the raw egg with the warmth of the cooked pasta just as it comes out of the pot! So, I had to order it and it tasted great - strong comfort food. They don't make their own pasta, but they do have a place that makes it for them - it has a light, delicate quality to it.

By decent atmosphere, I mean I didn't want my group to seem too loud amongst other patrons, but also wanted it to be fairly quiet that I could converse with my guests. San Francisco is a hard place to find restaurants that meet all criteria, mainly due to the parking issue. \n\nBella Trattoria is on Geary, which offers somewhat more parking than a restaurant downtown. My ceremony ended at 7:30, so I made the reservation for 8:15. Even though the restaurant was basically one giant hill away, I wanted to give my guests (coming in 3 different cars) enough time to find the place and find parking (which is tricky on a Friday night because of things happening on Geary and Clement, respectively). We all showed up on time, but the restaurant wasn't ready. I was a little irked because it was cold, raining and small (meaning some of my family had to stand outside while waiting). Finally three tables were vacated and they seated us. I will say the server was patient and originally very attentive.

My date ordered the Tagliata al Gorgonzola and oh my that steak was sooo delicious. I've always feared going on a date and liking my partner's plate more than mine but I gotta say it was pretty darn even this time. I loved my plate but definitely did catch myself asking him for some of his steak because it was just THAT good. Again, I ended this meal with the panna cotta because it's so tasty and light. \nThe restaurant itself is very quiet and intimate. The lights are very dim and perfect for a date. They do take reservations but both times I went were on a weekday so I was able to sit down without a reservation and no wait time. If you're attending on a weekend I do recommend a reservation because I do live right next to the place and see how busy it gets with people standing around outside of it.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-14"}, {"excerpts": ["For entrees, we ordered the smoked salmon tagliolini with black caviar (Tagliolini Salmone) and the squid ink spaghetti with seafood (Frutti Mar).

Make sure you ask if you want it! The bread was soft, and I loved the sun-dried tomato dipping oil. Just wished that the bread was warm because it was cold when we got it :( Still good, but could've been great if they warmed up the bread.\n\nI love bone marrow, so we ordered that as an appetizer. The bone marrow by itself was on the salty side a little more so than the usual, but eaten with the bread and parsley salad, it was great. Super rich and buttery like good bone marrow shouldbe.\n\nAt this point, our server randomly gave us two pieces of bruschetta on the house. Nothing spectacular, but hey it was free! An unexpected small treat.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the smoked salmon tagliolini with black caviar (Tagliolini Salmone) and the squid ink spaghetti with seafood (Frutti Mar). I LOVED the squid ink spaghetti. Great amount of seafood, PERFECTLY cooked al dente pasta, and the tomato sauce was so good that I started eating it by the spoonful by itself towards the end. \n\nThe smoked salmon pasta was more subtle. The pasta sauce was a little bland by itself, unless you got a bite with the smoked salmon or caviar. It was good, but I ended up wishing that there was more smoked salmon (even though they didn't necessarily skimp), just to make every bite as good as the ones with the salmon.\n\nWe ordered the panna cotta for dessert, as per Yelper recommendation. They put a little candle in it for my birthday and also gave us two mini glasses of dessert wine to go with it--Another unexpected treat on the house. The panna cotta was creamy yet light, and it went well with the tartness of the berries. Didn't think it was as amazing as others made it to be, but still good.\n\nOverall, the stars of our meal were the bone marrow and squid ink spaghetti with seafood, plus the great service with unexpected items on the house.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "How to pretend like you went on vacation to Italy while in SF: dine at Bella for craft pastas with the backdrop of a gorgeous (and quite realistic) mural of docked gondolas overlooking the Venice waterfront. \n\nGood Italian food can be challenging to find in these days of cookie-cutter lasagna and fettuccine alfredo, and Bella Trattoria is a gem tucked away in a corner in the Inner Richmond. The neighborhood is a lot more calm than the crowded/semi-touristy/quasi-racy North Beach area, and parking is actually not impossible. \n\nBella's menu features an enticing selection of pastas, a handful of entrees, and some apps. The real star is the pastas, which are made fresh daily o__O If I lived closer, I would be inclined to adopt a mindset of gotta try 'em all.\n\n(+) Bread with sundried tomato dip (complimentary): Not the best bread and dip I've had, but does set you in the mood for Italian food. The bread is buttery than most breads, a bit heavy with olive oil-based dip. The sundried tomato did not have much of a wow factor; the highlight was the softness of the bread.  \n\n(++) House cocktail ($7; vermouth, prosecco, orange): Described as \"the negroni gone wrong\", this rogue cocktail takes all the bitterness and alcoholicness out of the classic negroni and makes this very drinkable. It borders on a girl drink, presented elegantly in what looks like a tall shot glass. Would recommend for the general population, though not necessarily for anyone hard-core about strong whiskey and the like.\n\n(++) Bruschetta (complimentary): Despite usually being underwhelmed by chopped tomatoes on bread... this is probably the best chopped tomatoes on bread I've ever had. The base was a delicious buttery toast, topped with garden-fresh juicy tomatoes and aromatic basil garnish. \n\n(+++) La Vera Carbonara ($17.5; pancetta, pecorino, egg; no cream or butter). I can't believe it's not butter!! A lighter but extremely satisfying rendition of carbonara. The construction of the sauce from purely pecorino and egg makes for a simple and classic, yet unique and novel flavors. I'm still fascinated by the 3-ingredient composition. My only gripe is that the pancetta is chewier than I would have liked. \n\n(+++) Gnocchi Verdi ($18; spinach gnocchi, shiitake mushrooms, raddichio, gorgonzola bechemel): Although I'm usually not a gnocchi fan (hence my frequent mispronunciation), these little green dumplings were the most memorable bites of the night. The gorgonzola bechemel and raddicchio created a savory sauce heavy with smoky dimensions.The addition of the mushrooms brought back childhood memories of cream of mushroom, only with complex fine-dining-esque flavors. As for the gnocchi itself, it featured the Goldilocks ratio of al dente and softness; the satisfaction of biting into just the right texture was like finding the perfect boba.\n\n(++) Panna cotta (complimentary): I like how it's not too sweet, very vanilla-y, and well complemented with berries. Nice ending to the meal when there isn't quite enough stomach space for tiramisu. (Oh first world problems...)\n\nAs Yelpers have mentioned, the ambiance is cute and intimate: you won't fail to impress whether for date night or a nice family dinner. The lighting is dim with modern pendant Edison bulbs, but not so dark that your food pictures look abominable. \n\nService was efficient and quite gracious, as they did not frown upon my mispronunciation of gnocchi nor my choice of clothing (hospital scrubs do not seem the most fitting in an upscale Italian restaurant). \n\nThe verdict? Excellent food at reasonable prices, and still cheaper than going to Italy.

We arrived about half an hour early for our reservation, so they led us to the bar and helped us choose a bottle of wine to share while we waited. As soon as we sat down, I knew it would be good, because the staff are actually Italian. And Italians don't mess around when it comes to their cuisine.\n\nWhen we got to our table, they brought out some yummy house-made bread (great texture, would have been even better if it had been warm, but still very good) with a SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS dip of oil with chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Multiple people in our group (myself included) remarked that we're usually not huge fans of sun-dried tomatoes, but this dip was the bomb. We got like 3 or 4 plates of it, and could have happily eaten more! Honestly, if that was all I had eaten, I still would have given this place 5 stars. I will dream about that oil.\n\nThe whole menu looked so delicious that we had a really tough time deciding what to order. We ended up sharing some appetizers:\n\n1) BURRATA: I pretty much always order this when I see it on a menu, and theirs was particularly creamy and delicious.\n\n2) BONE MARROW: two people in our group are huge bone marrow fans who usually get judged for their habits of cracking open bones like cavemen to suck out the delicious interior, so they felt vindicated to see it on such a classy menu, and obviously we ordered it. They gave us a pretty generous portion, served in the bone with some crostini and a parsley salad on the side. It was great!\n\n3) POLENTA: Not much to say here, other than it was very yummy!\n\nWe each ordered our own main dishes, but I tried some of all of them, including:\n\n 1) SORRENTINA GNOCCI: This is what I ordered. It was wonderful. I love gnocchi, and I keep hearing that this place has some of the best gnocchi in the city, so I had to try it, and I gotta say, I'd believe that superlative! It melted in my mouth. \n\n2) RAGU SPECIAL: I can't remember the name of the pasta, but I think it was either tagliatelle or pappardelle. The sauce wasn't as good as I had hoped (a bit on the salty side) but overall pretty good.\n\n3) FRUTT' 'E MAR: Very good! I only tried the pasta itself and the calamari in the bites I took (so I can't judge the shrimp or mussels), but both were great. You could definitely taste a hint of squid in the squid-ink pasta. The sauce was also very good.\n\nNext time I want to get the gnocchi verdi!\n\nFor dessert we shared the following:\n\n1) VANILLA AFFOGATO: So. Good. If you like coffee ice cream, get this. It's like what coffee ice cream dreams of being.\n\n2) PANNA COTTA: I loved the balsamic glaze. It added just a touch of tartness to the smooth and creamy dish.\n\n3) SPUMONI: Wonderful.

We made reservations at 6:30 and no one was at the door to greet us or tell us what to do. My cousin was trying to find parking so I brought the kids into the restaurant and it was already 6:30. It was a very small restaurant with no space by the entrance. With no one telling us where our table was, the kids and I had to stand around for about 10 minutes before someone realized we were standing by small entrance by the door. Then it took them another 5 minutes to set up a table for us. There were already open seats but their seating process just took forever. We ordered a Gnocchi Verdi, Pasta Norcina, and a Frutt' 'E Mar. The food was decent. I didn't like the gnocchi verdi as much because the wine taste was very strong in that dish. The kids didn't enjoy it either. The Pasta Norcina was my favorite! We also asked for a 500 ml wine and they forgot about our wine order so we had to ask for it again. The waiter apologized for the misplacing our order. He was the best waiter that waited our table because he was responsive and apologetic when he forgot what we had ordered. There were at least 4 waiters/waitresses bussing our table. It just seemed very chaotic. If I were to visit SF again, I would most likely not come back or take people here unless I had a lot of time.

It is a small establishment, but the Maitre d' was completely accommodating and seated us in no time at all. \n\nI was very impressed with the waitstaff. It seemed like most of them actually were Italian-speaking which created a very authentic Italian atmosphere. As far as it goes, the ambiance of the restaurant was also very pleasing. I especially enjoyed the vintage lighting fixtures and the screens they used to minimize the intrusion of the city street. This is a cozy restaurant with romantic lighting, a distinguished bar and atmosphere. The only thing I noted that hindered a completely romantic experience was that it was quite loud, between the music and other diners speaking loudly.\n\nThe most important part of any dining experience is the food, and I was not the least bit disappointed. Immediately we were served our own water carafe and hot bread with a plate of sun-dried tomatoes drizzled with olive oil for dipping. Both my dining companion and I ordered a glass of the house red wine which was very good. I ordered the Gnocchi Verdi which is house made spinach gnocchi with crimini mushrooms, radicchio, in a gorgonzola bechamel sauce. It was so rich, creamy, and savory in the most delightful way.

The butternut squash ravioli was superb, delicate and sweet on the palate and very fresh. The carbonera is also fantastic, not heavy, just as described on the menu. The meatballs with eggplant sauce were also amazing, I somehow missed this dish on the menu but i'm very glad someone ordered it!\n\nEntrees:\nThe gnocchi was probably the softest I've ever eaten, a must order for sure. The veal was cooked to perfection and the b\u00e9chamel sauce was a nice touch, also highly recommended. The hanger steaks were enjoyed by the people who ordered them, personally I found the steaks just okay, maybe I just wasn't in a steak mood.\n\nDessert:\nThe affogoto was good, a nice touch to the end of the dinner. The panna cotta is worth the raving reviews found elsewhere on this site, even though I was very full I kept trying to eat it.\n\nService: Extremely friendly, personable, quick to laugh and almost had a \"you're family\" feel. At times our table felt slightly abandoned; I had to pour water and wine for the table twice, but that's me being VERY picky. The overall kindness, generosity and personality of the staff still won me over.\n\nIn conclusion: Exceptional dinner, will return, friendly service and I'm very surprised this restaurant doesn't have a michelin star behind it's name. \nHowever, I like the fact it's not well known or discussed in the popular food articles. keep it local, keep it friendly, and keep up the great work", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-01-18"}]}
