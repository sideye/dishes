It will surely leave you full for hours. The breakfast biscuit is another one of my favorites as well as the Pesto Toast (AMAZING), but their variety of waffles if especially delicious and one of a kind. My favorite is the Matcha waffle. Try it, you're taste buds will thank me.\n\nAlong with all the great menu items, the environment and staff are something that makes Rise & Grind especially enjoyable for me. The owners have gone out of their way to put local artists work on the walls and the business has a number of regulars you'll often see every time you go in. There's a great communal and hospitable vibe that keeps me coming back for more. To add to all the greatness of Rise & Grind, there is Cori the corgi, the resident dog who sets up camp at the spot every day and greets customers with a big smile. He's always willing to be played with and adds to the greatness of the baristas. If I could, I'd give Rise & Grind 10 stars but Yelp only lets me give 5.

Loooved this, and reasonably priced. \n\nBreakfast bunwich Sandwich ($7.50) - Pretty decent sandwich, with bacon, boiled egg, avocado, and thousand island dressing, but I would say it's a little overpriced for the size of it. Comes warm wrapped in foil. \n\nAvocado toast ($9.25) - I really really love avocado toast but I can't justify the price of this! Almost $10 for a thick piece of toast, soft boiled egg, and chili flakes. Although this was delicious, it's definitely overpriced compared to other places where I paid around $7 for the same thing. You can choose either a fried egg or soft boiled. \n\nFor two people our total was $33, which we thought was a bit expensive for everything but we enjoyed our breakfast nonetheless.
