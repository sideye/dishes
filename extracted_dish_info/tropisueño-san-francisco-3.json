The short review of this place would be that in my opinion Tropisue\u00f1o is the only Mexican restaurant that is worth visiting in downtown or FiDi.\n\nI've been here about a dozen times mostly for the lunch service. My advice is to come early like around 11:30 am as by 12 there is a line out of the door. 12:30 pm and you are better off getting something to-go as you will be end up standing and holding your plate for a seat to open up. The menu here is a little more than what you would expect in a Taqueria. It covers nachos, tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, enchiladas, tamale, quesadillas and plates with meat or combination of other items along with rice and beans. Ordering system for lunch is hybrid table service style, where you order at the counter, pay, get a token, find a table and have the food delivered to the table.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of the items on the menu and have yet to come across something that I have not liked. All ingredients used are fresh and the meat is especially good. You have a wide range of options for the meat which includes carne asada, barbacoa, chorizo, chile verde, al pastor, pollo asado and pollo tinga among others. There is a salsa bar on the inside to the right that you can help yourself too.\n\nMy favorite is the wet burrito i.e. Burrito Mojado ($9.50) that can be topped with red or green sauce. Making any burrito a super ($1.75) would add sour cream and guacamole to the burrito, but I generally avoid that as it makes it very heavy for lunch.\n\nPrice wise Tropisue\u00f1o is about 20% more expensive that other Taqueria's or quick serve Mexican restaurants in FiDi but the extra cost is totally worth it. When benchmarked against other Mexican restaurants Tropisue\u00f1o stands head and shoulders above the rest, hence it gets a well-deserved 5 star rating.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["I suggest the Mojado Burrito (~$10) "], "author": "Chris W.", "review": "Damn.

I suggest the Mojado Burrito (~$10) if you like it wet and flavorful. \n\nService: Everyone's no nonsense which I like (?). For dinner, the waitress told me to go drink at the bar to wait for my party. The bartender told me to update my ID picture. When the rest of my party came, the waitress told me to close out my bar tab and bring my beer to the table (Modelo Negro was ~$4 during HH btw). From this experience, I learned I'm really, really good at following directions. More importantly, I didn't really have to think about anything other than what I wanted to eat. \n\nFood: Everyone talks about the food so I'm not going to bore anyone with the details. Definitely order the guac and hit the Mole if you're into that. Everything on the menu is solid. I. mean. everything.

The short review of this place would be that in my opinion Tropisue\u00f1o is the only Mexican restaurant that is worth visiting in downtown or FiDi.\n\nI've been here about a dozen times mostly for the lunch service. My advice is to come early like around 11:30 am as by 12 there is a line out of the door. 12:30 pm and you are better off getting something to-go as you will be end up standing and holding your plate for a seat to open up. The menu here is a little more than what you would expect in a Taqueria. It covers nachos, tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, enchiladas, tamale, quesadillas and plates with meat or combination of other items along with rice and beans. Ordering system for lunch is hybrid table service style, where you order at the counter, pay, get a token, find a table and have the food delivered to the table.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of the items on the menu and have yet to come across something that I have not liked. All ingredients used are fresh and the meat is especially good. You have a wide range of options for the meat which includes carne asada, barbacoa, chorizo, chile verde, al pastor, pollo asado and pollo tinga among others. There is a salsa bar on the inside to the right that you can help yourself too.\n\nMy favorite is the wet burrito i.e. Burrito Mojado ($9.50) that can be topped with red or green sauce. Making any burrito a super ($1.75) would add sour cream and guacamole to the burrito, but I generally avoid that as it makes it very heavy for lunch.\n\nPrice wise Tropisue\u00f1o is about 20% more expensive that other Taqueria's or quick serve Mexican restaurants in FiDi but the extra cost is totally worth it.

The food and drinks are swell and the atmosphere is lively. \n\nOur waiter was a peach. He knew the menu well, and steered us in the right direction. Everything came out speedily and as requested. \n\nThe chips are light and crispy, just like I like 'em. We got three different salsas -- I tried the \"red one\" and liked it - a bit of kick without making you breathe fire. Our waiter took the chips away as he brought our food... which sounds like a potentially bad thing, but it was actually thoughtful. He said, \"Now that you have your food, you'll want to concentrate on that.\" Which is true -- you get a very substantial meal here, and it's delicious, so why fill up on chips if you're here for a main event? \n\nMargaritas are wonderful. They taste really fresh -- the house has an almost herbaceous edge -- and they serve them on the rocks. I tried the house and the watermelon. The house was great but I think I give the edge to the watermelon. No pitchers.\n\nTo the entrees... I loved my chili verde -- gone in a flash. Lots of tangy flavors, slightly spicy, and the meat was super tender. The accompanying rice provided a nice vehicle for absorbing some of the extra sauce. Perfecto! My friend loved her salmon -- which our sharp waiter recommended. And her husband had something with beef (sorry... can't remember what! Bad Yelper!) and he thought it was good -- wasn't raving over it, but was happy. Three types of beans -- refried, pinto, and black -- showed up at our table. I thought they were all grand, and the refried beans weren't greasy. Also really enjoyed the fresh, hot tortillas... though with the rice and beans, I honestly just had one, only to try it.  \n\nAnd I notice they like to keep the beverages movin' here. Even though they put a bottle of water on your table, the waiters and servers come by frequently to make sure your glass stays full. I really appreciated that. And the margaritas: Dang. We'd pretty much finish off a glass and it was like they had installed radars in the bottom of those glasses, designed to go off at the moment of Margarita Completion. Our waiter would come right by and be all \"Can I get you another?\" as if we were hanging out in his home and he was just being a gracious host. :) You're almost ready to say yes because they're so good... and the tequila wears your defenses down... so be ready to say no! Once you're in Margarita Town (TM) it's easy to be all, \"Yeah, bring it on!\" and forget that (a) there's tequila in them thar drinks and (b) you are, in fact, paying for them...\n\nGiven the proximity to all sorts of hotels and businesses, it draws a crowd. So, DO get reservations because even on a weeknight it gets busy. And if you're the first to arrive and your friends are on their way... still check in with the person at the front. They won't seat you until your entire party's there, but at least they probably won't give your table away.\n\nLong story short: You'll enjoy your food and beverages.

At about $12-$20 for most entrees, Tropisue\u00f1o will set you back about the same as going to an Anytown, USA Chevy's, and of course the food at Tropisue\u00f1o tastes much fresher than your \"local\" Chevy's (sorry no love for you, C!)\n\nI ordered the Tampique\u00f1o, and I was given a generous slab of steak and portion of rice, beans and tortillas served with a scoop of guac.  The dish was definitely a winner. \n\nIf you're in the mood for fresh Mexican cuisine and drinks that will hit the spot an won't break the bank, definitely give Tropisue\u00f1o a try.

The ambiance is great! Its nice but not too upscale where you fell like you can't relax. Amazing food and the drinks are out of this world, especially since El Jimador as their well tequila! The bartenders were very friendly, as well as the staff. \n\nOrder the Jamaicazo on the rocks! They in-house steep hibiscus in El Jimador for two weeks then add cucumber, lime, and agave. Probably one of the best drinks I've ever had. They don't use any cheap margarita mixes or tap systems. All are made and shaken by the bartenders.\n\nAppetizer: \nThe chips taste like the are made in-house, and come out with three different salsas (which were all delicious!). We ordered the \"Taste of 3\" Mariscos Crudos with Ceviche de Camarones, Salmon Crudo, and Callos Borrachos. Again, no complaints, they were all very good!\n\nMain Course:\nI had the Callos a la Plancha. The dish was a little on the smaller side (3 large scallops) but the entire dish was great, especially the plantain-chorizo hash! My Fianc\u00e9e ordered the Camarones Tropisueno.

Soy un fan de Tropisue\u00f1o!\n\nKnowing that there's always a line out-the-door at Tropisue\u00f1o, my friend and I decided to do an early lunch on Friday, 5.7.10. We arrived at 11:30 AM and luckily, there wasn't a line yet.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*Guacamole: $3.95 - YUMMY!  The guac was nice and buttery with hints from the garlic and chilis to give it a nice kick. However, there were very large chunks of avocados which would break the chip when you tried to scoop it out from the bowl. So, we ended up with pieces of chips inside the bowl.\n\nYes, the homemade chips were good and were served warm, however, they did NOT hold up to the guac as they were very light, thin, and crisp. They were similar to the Chevy chips but less oily and salty.\n\n*Chicken w/ Mole Poblano (dried peppers, nuts, and chocolate): $11.95 - YUMMY! This was the first time I had mole and although I was excited, I had my reservations b/c a \"savory\" chocolate flavor seemed less than appetizing to me. However, I was totally blown away. The chicken (white) was extremely tender and flavorful from soaking up the sauce which was creamy, savory, spicy, nutty, with a very slight bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. \n\n*Chicken w/ Mole Amarillo (dried chilies, red tomatoes, onions, and garlic): $11.95 - Meh! The chicken was dry and tasted more like chicken (used for the burritos?) tossed in pico de gallo. The sauce which was more like a salsa consisted of tomatoes, garlic, onions, and cilantro. It was quite bland and didn't have much to heat to it.  \n\nBoth moles came w/ a side of seasoned rice a choice of red, black, or refried beans, and a salad. \n\nThe rice was nicely seasoned and was cooked al-dente. The red and black beans were tender. They were unseasoned, however, it was topped with cotija cheese which gave it some seasoning. The salad consisted of crisp butter lettuce, 2 slices of red tomatoes, and 3 slices of avocados. \n\n*Pineapple Agua Fresca: $2.95 - It was ok; it was bit too syrupy and sweet for my taste.\n\n*Watermelon Agua Fresca: $2.95 - It was very refreshing and slightly sweet. It was a bit grainy which shows they used real watermelon.\n\nHowever, both Frescas were ROOM TEMP which was disappointing. \n\n*Salsa Bar: There were about 5 different types of salsas from what I recall. \n1. Salsa Verde was watery and was borderline flavorless w/ a very slight kick to it.\n\n2. Pico De Gallo (mild and medium) was fresh and had nice chunks of red tomatoes, onions, garlic, and cilantro, however, it was flavorless. \n\n3. Salsa Ranchera? (orangey color salsa): OMFG, it was SOOO YUMMY! For those who are familiar with the infamous Papalote Salsa which is creamy, garlicky, and packs a kick that will leave your mouth with a fiery aftertaste...this one comes pretty damn close.\n\n4. Salsa Roja was extremely HOT and vinegary. \n\n5. Condiments: Beets, jalapenos, pickled jalapenos with onions and carrots, white onions, and cilantro. \n\nSERVICE:\nThe service is so-so hence minus 1 STAR. We weren't greeted by the ladies who took our order and we waited 10 minutes at the register to pay b/c the cashier was fumbling w/ the register. She then just told us to come back and pay. \n\nIt's Taqueria style during lunch; look at the menu, order, get a number, pay, and they bring your food to your table which takes about 5 minutes or so. However, it's a sit-down restaurant during dinner. \n\nI'm not fond of the Taqueria-style ordering system here b/c it's highly INEFFICIENT during lunchtime. At 11:45 AM, although the dining area was near empty, there was a line of more than 30+ people that stretched far our the doorway which is caused by bottlenecks holding up the line from staring at the menu AND b/c there's only one register. Since they bring your food to you anyways, they might as well make it a \"sit-down\" restaurant during lunch as well.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nI LOVE the ambiance at Tropisue\u00f1o! It reminds me of a hacienda converted into a restaurant; the open kitchen w/ Spanish tiles, the dining area w/ sloping bamboo ceilings, rustic wooden tables, chairs, flooring, and cabinets, and the cabana style booths which adds a sexy romantic touch. \n\nPARKING:\nThere's a garage 1/2 block away on Market and 4th, however Public Transportation is highly recommended as the Powell Street station is just a block away. \n\nIf I'm in the area and craving Mexican food in a rustic environment, I'll definitely come back to Tropisue\u00f1o!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Tropisue\u00f1o is one of the cheaper not-fast-food places to eat downtown.

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a hankering for some Mexican pork. My friends got the carnitas tacos + chicken flauta and they also found them really good.

While the chicken itself was good, exhibiting the taste and flavor of a naturally raised bird, the mole was a little unbalanced.  A well made mole combines chiles, chocolate, spices, nuts and herbs into something rich and complex.  This mole was too sweet, with cinnamon and clove overwhelming everything else.  The standard accompaniment of beans and rice were not mere after thoughts, as is the case in many restaurants.  Here, the perfectly cooked staple could easily be a satisfying meal.\n\nWashing all of this good food down were the excellent $8 house margaritas.  Typically, the term \"house margarita\" is a shudder eliciting combination of crappy harsh tequila and syrupy sweet bottled mix.  Not true here.  This margarita in question is made with El Jimador tequila, fresh lime juice and agave nectar.  The glass is rimmed with a spicy chile salt.  Strong and delicious.  Did I mention it was $8?  Oh, and they drop that down to $5 during happy hour.  \n\nTropisue\u00f1o is the first Mexican restaurant to challenge the hold on my heart that Frontera Grill has.

The regular salsa and the salsa verde are very good for my taste, in other words, they are quite mild. LOL. I wished their guacamole were bigger because I can never have enough of them. The flautas were crispy and tasty as how they should be.\n\nThen we had two orders of their \"Los Favoritos,\" which included a taco, an enchilada, a tamale and a Chile relleno. They also came with rice. The beef taco and beef enchilada were exactly what I expected them to be. But I especially loved the chicken tamales and the Chile relleno. They are so full of flavors and delicious. The portion was generous and for $14.95, it was a steal. At Zazil in SF center, a chile relleno alone is $14. We also had the Tampique\u00f1o - a thin, marinated carne asada, topped with grilled green onions, and Fresh Mahi-Mahi en la Parilla - seasoned mahi-mahi with ground chive and cabbage slaw. Both dishes were delicious and memorable,\n\nOverall, I think it was a nice restaurant with great food in one of the best locations in the city at a very affordable price.

My first impression upon walking in the door was, \"Wow.  I clearly don't get out of the Mission enough for Mexican.\"  Far from a no-frills hole-in-the-wall, Tropisue\u00f1o is all big and nice.  Everything is painted in Mexican / Southwest motifs, and all the tables and chairs are nicely crafted and well-treated dark wood.\n\nWe probably arrived at around 8:30 on Friday evening, and sure enough, were quoted a 30-35 minute wait time for a table.  The bar, however, was nearly empty, so we opted for that.  (I mean, really; no waiting, equal access to food, and speedy access to booze and bartenders?  Why not sit at the bar, if there's only two of you?)  The friendly and attentive bartenders handed us a reasonably extensive menu of tequila cocktails right away, which was a pleasant surprise; we'd expected a reasonable selection of margaritas, but were extra intrigued by the variety and creativity of the list.  One side of the menu was devoted to variations on a classic margarita (ie, elderflower or ginger liquor in place of orange, or chili or vanilla flavored salt), and the other to other tequila-based cocktails.\n\nMy boyfriend started off with a classic margarita, which was pretty darn good, though not the best I've ever had.  I opted for a Santo, basically a margarita with St. Germaine elderflower liquor instead or orange liquor, and chili-flavored salt, also very tasty, though a little on the sweet side (he didn't like it as much as the classic).  Later, he ordered the ginger-flavored margarita, and when I couldn't decide what to try next, the bartender suggested a drink from the \"tequila cocktails\" list made with hibiscus-infused tequila and cucumber puree, which reminded me in some ways of things I've had at The Orbit Room.  I am not typically a huge fan of cucumber, but this absolutely worked; we both agreed that it was pretty fantastic and yummy.  Pretty much everything was in the $9-11 range (and I think there was one $12 drink), and worth it.\n\nAs with any Mesican establishment worth its salt (hah), chips and salsa were complimentary and quite tasty.  Don't know for sure, but I could believe the chips were homemade (still slightly hot with oil & with a fresh-tortilla-sort-of taste).  They brought a red tomato based salsa that was pretty good, and a green avocado-based one that was FABULOUS, though it could've done with just a bit more kick.  It was all I could do not to gorge myself on chips.  We also ordered the guacamole, which was also really delicious and fresh, if just a touch on the salty side.  It didn't look like much at first, but kicked our asses in the end; we were sad that we only managed to eat about half of it.\n\nBut understandable, all things considered.  I was drooling over half the things on the appetizer menu, but given my self-appointed status as benevolent empress-dictator in charge of SF ceviche quality control, I had to go with the ceviche, which was quite a generous portion for $6.  (Bonus points for the fact that it was tilapia & thus environmentally sound.)  REALLY good.  For entrees, I had the Chili Verde pork; the sauce had a fantastic, fresh green chili & black pepper flavor, with just the right amount of spice.  The pork itself was also of excellent quality: meaty chunks with not a lot of fat, but still tender enough to eat with a fork.  This was definitely one of the best parts of the meal.  My boyfriend had the Mole Poblano, which was sort of why we were there; he's definitely more of a mole eater than me, but I enjoyed the taste I had.  The chicken was good, and the mole sauce itself was thick and chocolaty, with a hint of smoke and a really nice cinnamon flavor.  Both entrees came with rice and beans, which were not amazing, but pretty good mixed in with the chili verde sauce.  About $100 even after tax and tip for two entrees, two appetizers, and four cocktails.\n\nThe atmosphere was laid back and fun; the bartenders were friendly and super-attentive, and the servers were absolutely on it the whole time we were there.  Not sure how often we'll get out here in the future given that it's a bart trip and a bit of walking, but it was definitely a fun and tasty evening.

But Erin (in case you did not know) is a sweetheart. She's the kind of sweet that would take in a box of stray kittens from a homeless woman at Wal-Mart. Just overflowing with sweet. So she takes pity on our pathetic and slightly wet souls and lets us in. (Though she had to rush to the kitchen to tell them that, even though she said that they could clean up, there was just one more customer...)\n\nSo from the very start I love this place. From there...it just keeps getting better (sorry for stealing the Christina Aguilera lyric...)\n\nSo back to Miss Erin. Aside from being utterly sweet, she's utterly devoted to this place. As an owner, she loves what she does and she loves her customers. How do I know? Because she told us. We were able to spend about 15 minutes talking with her and getting to know the \"lay of the land\" in regards to Tropisue\u00f1o. I've never had such a great time getting to know the owner of a restaurant before. Usually it's them talking about where they've worked, how fabulous they think they are...yada yada yada. Instead, she told us how excited and nervous she was for the restaurant to be starting. Mark and I both gave some suggestions, and even mentioned the Yelp part of ourselves, which she said she loved...because (to paraphrase) \"I want this restaurant to be for the locals. And Yelp is great for giving me feedback from the locals.\" Well Erin, this local loves what you're doing - keep it up my dear!\n\nManny (Manuel) the bartender makes the most delicious michelada - and seriously, I've had some good ones before. But his rocked. There's something about the secret recipe salt that he uses, with just a hint of lime and pepper...my lips weren't burning, my stomach wasn't hurting...it was D-double-LICIOUS! \n\n\nIn regards to food...I ordered Tropisue\u00f1o with the white beans. So f-ing good. Like not even playing. It all blended so perfectly together in my mouth that I thought I was having a food orgasm. Hell, I might have...who knows? And the white beans...yes, they are definitely one of their specialties. As Mark said, it does have a slight sweet taste to them. Though it's a natural sweet taste. But to me it taste like barley or oats.\n\nOverall, Tropisue\u00f1o definitely deserves it 5 star rating and if I could give it more then I would. Even if they are in the thick of \"downtown tourist\" central, they are made and cater to us local folks. With an exceptionally delicious menu of amazing and authentic quality food, backed up with the outstanding service from the employees and the owner...you have to try this place out. And while I might be a bit sad if I come back here and this place is swamped busy from such great reviews, I know that waiting around will be totally worth it.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Eating solo tonight I sat at the bar and had a kickass tropisue\u00f1o margarita, which was very tasty but a little light on the ginger & rose flavor....almost tasted standard except for the lemon-salt.

Overall, the d\u00e9cor manages to capture a certain Mexican flair without being cheesy like many places going for that look. \n\nThe food is quite fresh and tasty. They have two different types of vegan burritos. One involves some sort of marinated tofu and the other is grilled veggie. I believe you can get these in other forms like tacos and tostadas, but don't hold me to it. The tofu burrito was pretty good. The tofu didn't have much flavor. I kind of feel like Latinos don't know what to do with tofu sometimes and kind of freak out and just throw it in a burrito tasting all bland and sad, and then everyone is sad. The grilled veggie, though less exciting, is much better. The veggies are all grilldy and zesty and make it nice and flavorful. \n\nThey also have a salsa bar! I cannot understate the importance of a salsa bar. I hate it when you have to ask for extra salsa, so that you can pour it on your burrito! For a bite composer like me (I'm a nut case that likes to create the perfect balanced bite every time), side salsa is a must (I'm talking to you Chipotle!). Anyway, the guac is pretty good, though nothing to write home about. What I would post a serious letter to someone about are the Margaritas. They make them fresh with agave nectar! They are really quite delicious and not cloyingly sweet like many, and that's just their basic margarita. You don't even have to order top shelf for that. [By the way, I love how all the foodies have discovered that agave rocks everyone socks, and they're including it in all sorts of foodie drinks and stuff and acting like they just discovered it!

The green salsa was good, but the red salsa was awesome! You could tell it was homemade, and it tasted better than any salsa I've ever had. For drinks, my boyfriend and I got horchata and this too was no store-bought horchata. It's not like the sugar-filled drinks you'll buy from a store or get at other restaurants. This was sweet, but not too sweet. It was also kind of thick. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is good and should be tried.\n\nAs for dinner, my boyfriend ordered the mole and I ordered two tamales and an echilada. The enchilada was very good as were the tamales. My boyfriend really enjoyed his mole as well. For dessert, they only had one option. It's melted chocolate served with cinnamon tortilla chips and assorted fruit. Unfortunately, this wasn't on the menu, so I will just tell you now that it's $10, which might be a little too much, but it was good.

Once again, my awesome fellow Yelpers did not disappoint! We were in town for Wondercon and staying near Moscone. We were looking for a good Happy Hour and Tropisueno, aka Yelp Cafeteria to those in the know, was calling my name!!! \n\nWhat an awesome place. The vibe is mellow, the staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the margaritas are strong. The menu states that each margarita contains 2 ounces of quality tequila...and oh they are not kidding. I watched the generous pour of El Jimador go into our many margaritas and experienced the warm, happy, and eventually fuzzy feeling that followed. The happy hour is the best deal going...get here early because the bar fills up fast! House margaritas are $5 as are well drinks. Tequila shots are $4 and cans of Tecate are $2. There is a large assortment of happy hour food at reasonable prices.\n\nMy partner in crime had the house margarita which comes rimmed with a deliciously spicy chili salt. It was crisp, smooth, and strong. The other signature margaritas on the menu were not included in the happy hour (regular price $9,) but they sounded so interesting I had to try a couple. I ordered a Violeta, which was a violet perfume explosion in my mouth. It comes in a glass rimmed with vanilla salt. I am not sure this is for everyone but I enjoyed it. For my second drink I ordered the Tropisueno, a margarita with ginger liquer, lemon juice, and a rim of rose infused salt and sugar. This was a delicious variation of a lemon drop and my favorite drink of the evening. Our fabulous bartender also made us a Bloody Maria which was awesome. His special touch was the juice of half and orange which brought out the bright sweetness of the tomato in the mixer. \n\nThe happy hour food menu had so many amazing and inexpensive choices but we had a couple more stops to make on our happy hour food crawl, so we just ordered the nachos. The chips were light and crispy and the beans were deliciously creamy. There was an abundance of gooey cheese and fresh guacamole. The portion was huge and only $5.\n\nWe enjoyed our happy hour experience so much we returned the next day for lunch. Lunch is taqueria style where you walk up, order your food, and find your own seat. I ordered a rajas tamale with mole poblano and a bean and cheese tostada. My partner in crime ordered a shredded beef burrito. The tamale was light and fluffy with nice strips of chile and just enough gooey cheese. The mole was nicely spiced and a really good match with the tamale. The tostada had a generous portion of the creamy and delicious refried beans. The gigantic foil-wrapped burrito weighed about 3 pounds and was generously filled with tender and flavorful beef. There is a salsa bar with an assortment of fresh and tasty salsas.

My tablemate loved the green salsa, I loved the creamy warm salsa, that tasted like an excellent cream of tomato soup! the other salsa was a roasted tomato salsa that was good too.\n\nI loved that they had albondigas on the menu, so I asked the waiter if it was appetizer sized, and he said it was a full meal, but he offered to split it into two smaller bowls, and we took him up on it. Truly excellent, served with rice on the side and full of perfectly cooked potatoes and carrots in a nice tomato-y broth. The meatballs were firm and tasty. Great soup for a cool San Francisco night. \n\nMy partner ordered a triple combo: pork tamale, carne asada taco and barbacoa enchilada. I ordered the chile relleno. \n\nWe really were full after the excellent soup. The chile relleno was excellent, with a picadillo like filling, ground beef, raisins, green olives and small pine nuts. The sauce was delicious. The refried beans were tasty and the cumin-y rice was firm and quite nice. \n\nMy tablemate did not fair as well. The tamales ends were rock hard as if they'd been in a steamer far too long, and the masa had a funny licorice-y taste. The filling in the tamale was good. The enchilada with barbacoa was excellent. The carne asada was tasteless and seemed like it was just chopped up sirloin. There was a huge gristly piece which, unfortunately, was his first bite.\n\nWhen we pointed out the problems with the entree, it was taken off the bill, which was appreciated.

He actually said \"I don't know, some type of milk\". To be fair, that cake was freaking AWESOME. Tasted light and fluffy kinda like Angel cake. \n\nWhen we exhausted our free Nachos and asked for more, they didn't come with extra salsa ( which I had to ask for twice before I finally got it)\n\nThere is definitely a language barrier as I asked them what type of rice they had and they said 3 (white, black, and refried).. umm ok I think they misunderstood my question.\n\nFood: The chips are excellent. Their salsa is so plain! And, their guacamole (free with Nachos) tastes like bananas and is watered down :(\n\nThe main dishes were very bland, nothing special at all! Very greasy too. Their mexican rice was very typical and bland. The beans were extremely salty and again.. for lack of a better word.. bland.\n\n\n-  2 stars for high price, \"meh\" food and drinks, \"meh\" service.\n\nWINE HERE IS VERY BAD.

Although the interior is a tad kitschy, it still evokes a sense of authenticity, all told. Rich, dark interior, with bamboo roof in areas, enclosing you in a cozy cocoon.  Good start.  We were seated by the window, and I love to people watch, so this was perfect.\n\nWater and chips and salsa come out promptly.  Things are looking up...especially after I try the superb salsa.  So we wait...and wait...and wait.....no service.  I eventually have to get up and ask for service.  Strike one.\n\nSo we ordered the guacamole as an app.  This version was served chunky, and was quite good. Only problem? The thin chips could not stand up to the \"heft\" of the guacamole, and kept breaking off.   Boo!\n\nAlso ordered the seared sea scallops as a starter. Quite pleased with these for the most part.  Cooked fairly well, and presented with a wonderful accompanying avocado-tomatillo salsa.  Yum.\n\nTheir entire menu does reflect authentic Mexican coastal cuisine.  Execution is generally a positive.  So...on that note, on to the entrees.\n\nWe split the Chile Relleno de Picadillo, and were quite pleased.  Wonderful meshing of flavors.  \n\nInteresting note. With entrees, the black beans are served as a side in a separate dish. Not so with the rice.  It would be nice if the rice were as well.  I didn't even eat much of mine.\n\nOur server then offered what I thought was a wonderful suggestion: to try their award-winning mole.  Oooh, yes please, sounds like a plan!\n\nOut comes a full \"chicken with mole poblano\" entree.  Uhh....we didn't discuss the chicken or an entree, we were talking about mole, remember?  \"Oh, I'm sorry...well it's quite good.\"\n\nHrmph.  Thought about sending it back, but viewed this as an opportunity to try another dish instead.  Gotta say, the mole is a knock out.  So good!  But...the chicken served with this dish is bone-in, with the meat very inaccessible underneath the veneers of mole and skin.  I'm not one to eat the skin personally, and would have preferred a different cut of chicken (not leg or thigh) for this dish, preferably one with much more meat to actually eat! Alternately, skin the chicken for us, or serve the mole on the side.  As it stood, we were left with not-so-tidy mounds of bone and skin on our plates.  No es bueno!\n\nOn a positive note, the shared entrees were served split for 2 people, without us having to request it.\n\nHaving eaten plenty of exceptional Mexican food in both TX and NM, my standards for quality Mexican fare are pretty high, especially considering I know how incredibly bloated and stuffed I will feel afterwards!  All in all, pretty average with a couple notable exceptions (mole), but I doubt I'd return soon for a full meal, with all of the wonderful food to try in this city.  \n\nFood: 3.5\nValue: 3\nAmbiance: 3.5\nService: 2.5", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-12-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered it with picadillo, which had lovely spices and raisins.

No, but it's a solid lunch stop that will fill you up and get you buzzed if you're living dangerously. \n\nDuring the day, Tropisue\u00f1o features quick-service counter ordering with staples like burritos and tacos. You can take your items to go or grab a table. In the evening, they offer plated and seated service with more entrees and a slightly higher price point. If you happen to arrive at the end of lunch service like I did on my most recent trip, you may feel like you're losing your mind when you look back at the wall-sized menu as you approach the front of the line, for it will disappear. It turns out it rolls up and out of sight and that you aren't hallucinating. \n\nI've stuck with the pollo tinga burrito and have been happy each time.

"], "author": "Ahmad J.", "review": "Tropisue\u00f1o is a Mexican Taqueria for lunch which turns into a sit down restaurant for dinner service in the heart of downtown SF. The short review of this place would be that in my opinion Tropisue\u00f1o is the only Mexican restaurant that is worth visiting in downtown or FiDi.\n\nI've been here about a dozen times mostly for the lunch service. My advice is to come early like around 11:30 am as by 12 there is a line out of the door. 12:30 pm and you are better off getting something to-go as you will be end up standing and holding your plate for a seat to open up. The menu here is a little more than what you would expect in a Taqueria. It covers nachos, tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, enchiladas, tamale, quesadillas and plates with meat or combination of other items along with rice and beans. Ordering system for lunch is hybrid table service style, where you order at the counter, pay, get a token, find a table and have the food delivered to the table.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of the items on the menu and have yet to come across something that I have not liked. All ingredients used are fresh and the meat is especially good. You have a wide range of options for the meat which includes carne asada, barbacoa, chorizo, chile verde, al pastor, pollo asado and pollo tinga among others. There is a salsa bar on the inside to the right that you can help yourself too.\n\nMy favorite is the wet burrito i.e. Burrito Mojado ($9.50) that can be topped with red or green sauce. Making any burrito a super ($1.75) would add sour cream and guacamole to the burrito, but I generally avoid that as it makes it very heavy for lunch.\n\nPrice wise Tropisue\u00f1o is about 20% more expensive that other Taqueria's or quick serve Mexican restaurants in FiDi but the extra cost is totally worth it. When benchmarked against other Mexican restaurants Tropisue\u00f1o stands head and shoulders above the rest, hence it gets a well-deserved 5 star rating.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the pollo tinga in my taco and it was SO GOOD.

I recommend the pollo tinga and the (pork) chile verde. I come here pretty often because it's in the same block as my work.\n\nTropisue\u00f1o also deserves high marks for its salsa bar. My favorite is the salsa verde with guacamole mixed in.\n\nI also appreciate having a good source of ceviche this close to my work. (Again, not the best ceviche in SF, but so what?)
