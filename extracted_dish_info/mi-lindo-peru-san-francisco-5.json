Finally I had the chance to co-sponsor a private UYE with prolific Yelper Marti L. that brought 30 Yelpers to break bread here, including a much appreciated appearance by Yelp co-founder, Russ S. and good friend and East Bay CM Ligaya T. \n\nI had the pleasure to reconnect with many Yelpers and met several Bay Area notables for the first time. This included Darryl P, Danny L, David B, Simone W, Jason G, Jonathan W, Karen Y, Michael M, Phillip W, Peter L, Hannah C, May C, Dorothy C and husband Peter, Rinky N and husband Mike, Stephanie J and her guest Linh, Tom R, Manabu M, Tammy C, Earl G and wife Joyce, Hen A, Marti L and boyfriend Sam, Russ S and Ligaya T.\n\nWe ordered a total of 22 dishes for a family style feast and had a lot of fun passing them around. To mention a few, we shared:\n\n***Appetizers:\nChicharron De Pollo - breaded piecesof chicken with lemon juice\nCeviche Mixto - assorted seafood in fresh lime juice\n\n***Main Entrees:\nSaltado De Pollo - lean strips of chicken sauteed w / onions, tomatoes & french fries\nLomo Saltado - lean strips of beef sauteed w/ onions, tomatoes & french fries\nPaella Marinera - saffron flavored spanish rice with seafood\nPescado Sudado - steamed snapper fillet topped w/ onions, tomatoes and potatoes\nArroz Con Pollo- chicken cooked with rice and green peas in cilantro sauce\nTamal De Pollo- steamed corn dough stuffed with chicken\nPescado Al Ajo- fried fillet topped with a butter-garlic sauce and a touch of white wine served with seasoned rice and sliced potato\nPlantains- fried bananas\n\n***Vegan Dishes (Special request):\nEnsalada Mixta--mixed greens with avocado, potatoes & tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing\nSaltado De Vegetables - sauteed onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes & french fries served w/ seasoned rice\nPaella De Verduras - saffron flavored spanish rice with vegetables \n\nThroughout the dinner people were talking about how much they enjoyed the ceviche, pescado al ajo, and paella. Playing host, I didn't get to try all the dishes but thought the Arroz Con Pollo, Saltado De Pollo, Lomo Saltado, and Pescado Al Ajo were very good. The paella unfortunately didn't have the crispy texture but the flavor was still robust and a major highlight of the evening. The only dish that didn't win people over was chicharron de pollo which people said was dry. I also thought the tamal de pollo was decent. Portions were very generous.\n\nThe owner, Carlos, was the most pleasant and easy person to work with. I had the opportunity to work closely with him for a month to plan this event. The U-shaped table arrangement wasn't the easiest for everyone to intermingle, but it also gave us a nice open area for people to eventually get out of their seats and reach out to those they haven't seen in a while. Carlos was our server and was the most attentive, caring, and knowledgeable on which dishes were good for sharing; and was very effective in serving to the needs of our vegan friends. For a group of this size, he gave us the best service I've ever experienced to date. \n\nMy co-sponsor, Marti L, was instrumental in the success of this event and I can't thank her enough for the work she's done. Just to be clear to my readers, the restaurant did not have advanced knowledge that this was a Yelp event so the scores of affiliated reviews were reflective of how the restaurant normally operates. In the end everyone paid $12.10 per person, including tax and 20% tip. Weighing in on the price and value, this is by far the best tasting and most affordable private UYE I've organized to date.\n\nSince the event, people are still telling me that they are expecting to revisit Mi Lindo Peru on their own in the near future, which says a lot about their first rate culinary acumen, d\u00e9cor, price, portions, and service.

I've been to several Peruvian restaurants (upscale places) around the city and even gone to the Peruvian food festival that happens yearly. Surprised with myself that I have not discovered this HIDDEN GEM earlier!!! I've driven by this place a million times and have read reviews on yelp, finally had the chance to eat here. \n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nBREAD (free) -  bread while you wait for your meal. Good fresh bread with a spread of butter but don't waste your appetite eating all the bread, your meal portions are big.\n\nPERUVIAN CORN (~$2) - If you never seen Peruvian corn, they are huge. Looks like their pulled each kernel off, fried them, and served it as a side. LOVE IT, always refer to these as \"Peruvian corn nuts\".\n\nCHICHARRON De CALAMARES ($8.95) - Fried squid serves with their house sauce. the sauce is light pink and has that perfect dipping sauce thats not too powerful and not too light. Also on the side is a pinch of vegetables that tasted like ceviche. Thus far the best place I know in the bay area that knows how to serve up Calamari. Damn good calamari.\n\nSALTADO De POLLO ($12.95) - Lean strips of  chicken sauteed with onions, tomato, and french fries also served with a side of their rice. their rice is NOT typical rice it has a really different taste to it. SO GOOD. And the description sound so simple but the flavors are amazing. If you had Lomo Saltado, you know exactly what i mean. This is the first place to have a chicken version of lomo saltado. absolute heaven!!! Well worth your money, get left overs, and the portions of the serving is ALOT.\n\nGAMBAS AL AJO ($15.95) - prawns sauteed in wine, butter, and garlic sauce served with rice. Same kind of rice as their serve with all their other dishes. The sauce on the prawns was droolicious and they give you good amount of prawns. Well worth your money.\n\nLUCUMA ICE CREAM (~$4) - topped the meal with some ice cream. OMG I love lucuma ice cream. Had it several times in the past at other restaurants and will order it again and again. It's orange and you'd think it tastes very fruity but its not like that. It's a subtle creamy light taste. My mouth is salivating.\n\nWill I be back? You don't have to ask me twice!!!!\n\nUntil the next review....", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-05-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Started with Chicharron De Calamares, which was a tad salty but dipping sauce was good.

Standing from the outside looking in, this small cozy restaurant embodies the spirit of \"fiesta familiar\" via its red and mango colored coordination from the inside out to which projects a vibrant atmosphere suitable for both intimate and festive occasions. This place has been sitting on my radar for the past year after having the privilege of dining at other great restaurants in the area. Finally I had the chance to co-sponsor a private UYE with prolific Yelper Marti L. that brought 30 Yelpers to break bread here, including a much appreciated appearance by Yelp co-founder, Russ S. and good friend and East Bay CM Ligaya T. \n\nI had the pleasure to reconnect with many Yelpers and met several Bay Area notables for the first time. This included Darryl P, Danny L, David B, Simone W, Jason G, Jonathan W, Karen Y, Michael M, Phillip W, Peter L, Hannah C, May C, Dorothy C and husband Peter, Rinky N and husband Mike, Stephanie J and her guest Linh, Tom R, Manabu M, Tammy C, Earl G and wife Joyce, Hen A, Marti L and boyfriend Sam, Russ S and Ligaya T.\n\nWe ordered a total of 22 dishes for a family style feast and had a lot of fun passing them around. To mention a few, we shared:\n\n***Appetizers:\nChicharron De Pollo - breaded piecesof chicken with lemon juice\nCeviche Mixto - assorted seafood in fresh lime juice\n\n***Main Entrees:\nSaltado De Pollo - lean strips of chicken sauteed w / onions, tomatoes & french fries\nLomo Saltado - lean strips of beef sauteed w/ onions, tomatoes & french fries\nPaella Marinera - saffron flavored spanish rice with seafood\nPescado Sudado - steamed snapper fillet topped w/ onions, tomatoes and potatoes\nArroz Con Pollo- chicken cooked with rice and green peas in cilantro sauce\nTamal De Pollo- steamed corn dough stuffed with chicken\nPescado Al Ajo- fried fillet topped with a butter-garlic sauce and a touch of white wine served with seasoned rice and sliced potato\nPlantains- fried bananas\n\n***Vegan Dishes (Special request):\nEnsalada Mixta--mixed greens with avocado, potatoes & tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing\nSaltado De Vegetables - sauteed onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes & french fries served w/ seasoned rice\nPaella De Verduras - saffron flavored spanish rice with vegetables \n\nThroughout the dinner people were talking about how much they enjoyed the ceviche, pescado al ajo, and paella. Playing host, I didn't get to try all the dishes but thought the Arroz Con Pollo, Saltado De Pollo, Lomo Saltado, and Pescado Al Ajo were very good. The paella unfortunately didn't have the crispy texture but the flavor was still robust and a major highlight of the evening. The only dish that didn't win people over was chicharron de pollo which people said was dry. I also thought the tamal de pollo was decent. Portions were very generous.\n\nThe owner, Carlos, was the most pleasant and easy person to work with. I had the opportunity to work closely with him for a month to plan this event. The U-shaped table arrangement wasn't the easiest for everyone to intermingle, but it also gave us a nice open area for people to eventually get out of their seats and reach out to those they haven't seen in a while. Carlos was our server and was the most attentive, caring, and knowledgeable on which dishes were good for sharing; and was very effective in serving to the needs of our vegan friends. For a group of this size, he gave us the best service I've ever experienced to date. \n\nMy co-sponsor, Marti L, was instrumental in the success of this event and I can't thank her enough for the work she's done. Just to be clear to my readers, the restaurant did not have advanced knowledge that this was a Yelp event so the scores of affiliated reviews were reflective of how the restaurant normally operates. In the end everyone paid $12.10 per person, including tax and 20% tip. Weighing in on the price and value, this is by far the best tasting and most affordable private UYE I've organized to date.\n\nSince the event, people are still telling me that they are expecting to revisit Mi Lindo Peru on their own in the near future, which says a lot about their first rate culinary acumen, d\u00e9cor, price, portions, and service. I too, expect to return to this beautiful restaurant which I call Nuestro Muy Lindo Peru.\n\nI invite everyone to check out Philip W's review for the wonderful photos taken at the event.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-03-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We also had the empenada, which was filed with meat, raisins, and olives, and the tamal de pollo, which was a lot of masa to a very meager amount of chicken.

I hate when people do this - how is this even remotely in the restaurant's control??? [/soapbox]\n\nCharming little restaurant, full of food smells - so awesome and welcoming!  I think this place can accommodate about 40 people tops but it's still very spacious and you get a lot of privacy even with all the coziness.

So, we conceded.  Along the way, my brother realizes we have to pick up Mike as well.  Hmm, we'll have to pack some of this stuff in the back seat in the car, but, no problem.  Then, we miss the Avalon Dr. exit, which is the one to take to get  cheap gas on Westborough.  Oh well, guess we'll just fill up at the Hickey exit.  We get gas, then drive over to Mike's.  By now, Len, Lars, and Yian have already gotten a table at Mi Lindo's.  Doh!  So we're already 20 minutes late.  Then at Mike's, Fran enters the car... err, where's Mike?  He pops in a minute later.

She proposed dinner at one of her favorite Peruvian (or any other cuisine, for that matter) places & exalted the flavors to be found there. Intrigued by the praises, I was game. So we were off & away from the tourist-y Piers to Bernal Heights . Mi Lindo Peru is itself as much a contrast to the loud, modern Peruvian bar we were just at as its neighborhood is to the Pier 1 1/2 location of that previous stop. Walking through the narrow door on the left of a bright, bold red-painted exterior, the inside, also painted red, offers a warm, homey feeling.\n \nArriving ahead of the dinner rush, we were seated immediately. Service was friendly & attentive. I began to survey the menu, but the girlfriend already had something specific in mind. She ordered & I awaited the food of her high acclaim. The wait was not long.\n \nOut came appetizers of Gambos al Ajillo (shrimp in butter/garlic sauce) & Papa aia Huancaina (potato in a spicy cheese sauce) along with bread, butter & salsa. The shrimp was simply awesome. With the aid of some of the bread, the plate was completely cleaned of all traces of the butter/garlic sauce.\n\nThis was not the only time the bread would be drenched & slathered in awesomeness, however. The salsa was crazy delicious with distinct, unique flavors I had never tasted before. Spreading butter & then salsa on top of that onto bread might sound odd, but just do it - awesome, really.\n\nThe cold-pressed potato in cheese sauce appetizer was good too, though the sauce didn't have the delicacy or complexity of a similar sauce at our previous Peruvian eatery. The version at Mi Lindo Peru was more home-style.\n\nTo wash down our food, the girlfriend had a glass of sangria. I thought I'd give Peruvian beer a try so I had a Cristal. The beer wasn't anything special, but I tried the girlfriend's sangria & that was definitely the way to go.\n\nNext came our entrees: Aji de Gallina (chicken in a creamy yellow sauce) & Lomo Saltado (beef strips on french fries). The beef strips & fries were good. In most other meals this dish would have been very well liked (& yeah, sure I still liked it enough), but this time it was completely overshadowed by the chicken in a yellow sauce of incredible flavors that I, yet again, had never tasted before. The sauce was reminiscent of a creamy Thai curry, but definitely with a Peruvian twist that was unlike anything I had ever tried before. Only a few bites were necessary to elevate this dish from unknown to one of my absolute favorites.\n\nI love this dish so much that I already went back with the girlfriend a 2nd time shortly after this 1st visit for more. We, again, got the Gambos al Ajillo, tried the Causa de Pollo (mashed potato stuffed chicken salad) which was quite yummy & of course, got 2 orders of Aji de Gallina (1 to eat & 1 to take home). We also took home a cup of the salsa.\n\nMi Lindo Peru has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat.
