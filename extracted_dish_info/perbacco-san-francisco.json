Would be great for business lunches/dinners or dates (but maybe not the first one XP).\n\nI picked this spot for a team lunch and was able to make the reservation for our party of 8 for a noon lunch on Wed just the day before. I appreciated their flexibility as I was scrambling to find a last minute lunch spot to accommodate our larger group. Note that for larger groups, they do ask for a credit card number when you make the reservation.\n\nNote: don't get this restaurant confused with its sister restaurant Barbacco, which is more casual and comes at a slightly lower price point. Even though I was trying to avoid making this mistake, I still somehow made reservations at Barbacco first. Whoops.\n\nThey start out the meal with small thin breadsticks, which I've never seen before. These were just okay, but I wasn't a huge fan of the long and thin shape. Also I thought they were slightly dry, even with the provided sauce.\n\nLuckily they followed this up with some delicious bread. I'm not sure exactly what type of bread it was (our guess was focaccia), but it was very light and soft. When they came around to offer seconds of this bread, I went for it with no doubt or hesitation.\n\nI asked our server about their most popular dishes, and according to her, the pappardelle ($24) is the most popular dish here. It comes with slow cooked short rib ragu, young onion, and horseradish sprinkled on top. It came served piping hot, and while I didn't like the wasabi flavors on top, it was otherwise a very solid and filling dish. The pappardelle was thin and didn't stick to each other, which made it easy to eat.\n\nFor dessert, we shared two orders of the amaretti panna cotta ($11), which is served with roasted roasted peach preserve, almonds, maple caramel, and peach sorbetto. It was light and creamy and provided the perfect light and sweet ending to a heavy carb meal.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-10-29"}, {"excerpts": ["And with the recent influx of deliciously affordable pasta shops in the city, Perbacco just kept getting pushed further and further down the list.\n\n", "But, having the opportunity to nab a company-sponsored meal several weeks back, Perbacco popped back up on my radar, making it the first time I took a proper look at their menu: to my surprise, their pastas averaged $20, like many other restaurants here, but with an additional choice between \"smaller\" and larger portions.\n\n", "And while they still don't topple my other picks in the city, there's definitely a time and place (and mood) for the style of pasta here, so I'm absolutely adding Perbacco into the rotation.\n\n"], "author": "Johnny W.", "review": "*** In Short ***\n\nSurprisingly affordable pasta that still holds up well against the upstarts.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nWhile I frequented Barbacco in my early years, I never got around to trying their pricier sister restaurant, always assuming it was outside my \"casual\" fancy eats budget.

Not bland, mind you, but lighter and more flavorful than you'd expect from pasta served up in America, which often tend to be heavy-handed with butter, cream, and other seasonings.

It was more than we should order for two people. If I had to pick, I'd get the octopus and the carrots, since the burrata cheese is good, but not extraordinary in any way (the octopus is always great and I order it every time!) \n\nFor the pastas, we ordered the agnolotti and the tajarin. Initially, they had accidentally served us the agnolotti with short rib instead of the one on the menu (filled with roasted meats and vegetables). We hadn't even noticed the error, but the quickly brought us the correct pasta and told us to keep the original as well since we had started eating it. 5/5 for handling the situation very gracefully and quickly without us even noticing. (Servers are well trained for details in general- every time I'd use the restroom, my napkin would be neatly folded when I'd come back- something many more high-end restaurants in SF still need to do).\n\nWe liked both the agnolottis more than the tajarin. I like thin tagliatelle but I don't think the veal and the sauce went very well with it. \n\nThe agnolotti filled with roasted meats and vegetables was definitely our favorite pasta. \n\nThe best part of Perbacco is definitely the desserts. We got the dark chocolate bonet along with the vanilla bean panna cotta. I can't compare the two since they're both amazing. \n\nThe vanilla cream, the brownies and the berries help enhance every bite of the bonet, which would have been amazing on its own. My usual style is to take a little bit of the vanilla cream and the brownie with a decent chunk of chocolate bonet to have an explosion of happy tastes in your mouth. I'm already hungry writing this review now. \n\nThe vanilla bean panna cotta is also delicious and works really well with the strawberry-rhubarb preserve and the lime sorbetto, which fills your mouth with a light, refreshing taste after the main courses. \n\nWe were there for four hours and enjoyed it thoroughly.

Clean and relaxing.\n\nOur waiter was young and slightly inexperienced but he did a pretty good job, except no parmesan cheese offered--always had to request.  And the gnocchi came cold.  He gladly offered to reheat and it came back cold again.  I'm not sure if the blame should go to the server, but he ended up bringing a brand new order that was up to temperature.\n\nHere's what we ingested:\n\nPESCE CRUDO (HAMACHI) (2/5)  Low marks for the hamachi which was ever so slightly fishy and not impressive in the least.\n\nROASTED OCTOPUS - (4/5)  The folks at the table gave this dish a thumbs up.  Very small portion so don't plan to share unless you're a party of two.  \n\nBURRATA W/PERSIMMON (2/5) If an appetizer with burrata is on the menu, we order it.  We've had our share of burrata appetizers.  By comparison, this one is at the bottom of the totem pole.  Underwhelming not only in portion size, but also the cheese lacked flavor and creaminess.  This one I would not recommend.\n\nAGNOLOTTI (3/5) Filled with roasted meat and cabbage, many Yelpers sang its praises.  I liked it but didn't love it.  A bit too one note and salty for me.  After a few bites, you were looking for something else.  Best agnolotti that I've ever tasted came from Il Ristorante di Giorgio Baldi in LA. It's the AGNOLOTTI in CORN TRUFFLE SAUCE.  When you're in LA, please do yourself the favor of getting to that restaurant to eat that specific dish.  Getting back to the point, I would not order the agnolotti again at Perbacco's.\n\nTAGLIATELLE w/VEAL RAGU (3/5)  My daughter didn't complain about this dish, but I'd like to take the opportunity to tell you what was wrong with this pasta dish.  First, the pasta itself was good, very good.  The problem was the veal ragu. It was dry, lacking flavor and uninviting. The ladle-ful of ragu was sitting in the middle of the pasta.  Normally, you would take one forkful of the pasta and the sauce in the center would start naturally start spreading over the plate and onto the unsauced pasta.  But not with this sauce.  It was too dry and not saucy at all, which is one of the biggest reasons this dish doesn't pass the test.  If you're going to put a sauce in the center, it needs to be saucy enough to work itself around the plate.  End of pasta sauce 101 tutorial.\n\nBEEF LOIN & BRAISED SHORT RIB (3/5)  Another just OK dish.  On one side of the plate, one small braised short rib, and on the side was a very small slab of beef loin.  I didn't care for the short rib and I'm hard-pressed to tell you why.  The flavor not there, yes tender, but the sauce wasn't good.  The beef loin was good, and the little there was, I enjoyed it with the horseradish.\n\nPerbacco has great potential, but tonight it wasn't realized.  Maybe this is a restaurant that \n*used * to be good.  I don't know.  But if I base my judgement on last night's experience, it's a three at best.

The hamachi was really fresh which was really surprisingly since it's an Italian place. The whole dish had a lot of different flavors going on but surprisingly everything went really well together. I would definitely recommend trying this dish.  \n\nFor our entrees, we got their Duck Rissotto (4/5) and Pappardelle w. Lamb Ragu (4/5). The duck risotto was very creamy and rich and yet had this hint of sweetness that accentuated the dish. The Pappardelle was cooked al dente which I love. I've tried Pappardelle at other places and sometimes it's really bad bc they undercook the pasta but Perbacco was right on with the texture of the dish. I was impressed. The lamb was very tender and moist and wasn't gamey. Both dishes were excellent. \n\nFor dessert we got their Lemon Thyme Panna Cotta (3/5) which was a very pretty dish with an array of fruits and nuts. Loved the side of sorbet which was very refreshing. The panna cotta was good and you could definitely taste the thyme but I've had better. \n\nOur waiter gave us an extra dessert for free! Yay free food! He gave us their Hazel Nut Meringue which was good... there was chunks of hazel nut embedded into the meringue... I can't complain it was free. \n\nTo end the dining experience they also handed out petite four at the end that consisted of chocolate and a nut based chew... it was good but I was uncomfortably full at that point... \n\nOverall it was a nice meal. Our waiter was nice and was very attentive to us. Made sure our wine glasses were full at all times... Oh we ordered a bottle of Barbera upon recommendation from our waiter and it was very good... Yum! :) If you're in the area you should definitely check this place out!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-06"}, {"excerpts": ["A few tweaks and Perbacco will make it into the rotation. \n\n"], "author": "Chuck N.", "review": "Friday, 1:30 PM. \n\nQuickie:\n* Food\n++ Service\n-  Slow turnaround\n+  Hygiene\n+  Lively vibe\n\nAnd then...?\nA few tweaks and Perbacco will make it into the rotation. \n\n**********\nStuffed my face in:\n\n1.

We found a spot a block over a little before 6pm.\n\nComplimentary breadsticks with pesto - I love pesto, but this was just bland! Plus with the crunchy breadsticks it was actually a little messy which I didn't like. Who wants to drip pesto on tablecloths?!\n\nSalumi misti ($29 for a large) - A selection of house cured salumi inspired by traditional piemontese recipes. There was a good amount of meats, but none of them stood out except the pate. They were all a little lackluster and didn't have much flavor. I don't get why this was/is on the 7x7 list.\n\nPesce crudo ($15) - Hamachi, shaved hearts of palm, blood orange, kumquat, serrano pepper. I love hamachi, hearts of palm and serrano pepper. I wasn't sure if I would like the kumquat but it didn't make the dish overly sweet so I didn't mind it.\n\nPiastra roasted octopus and pork belly ($14) - Olive oil crushed potatoes, salsa verde, celery fennel salad. The octopus was a little tough. And I love chewy octopus! The flavors blended well together, but I had a texture problem with this dish.\n\nSeared sea scallops ($31) - Hearts of palm and seasonal citrus ragout, sea urchin, chrysanthemum. Good thing I like hearts of palm cuz it was in this dish too! The scallops were nicely cooked. The sea urchin added a lovely subtle touch.\n\nPappardelle ($19 for a large) - Wide pasta ribbons, slow cooked short rib ragu, grated horseradish. The pasta was perfectly cooked! And the short rib was nicely stewed, but together, something just didn't gel. The sauce didn't seem to bring the meat and pasta together.\n\nDry aged liberty farm duck breast ($28) - Stone fruit radicchio panzanella, basil, apricot duck rillettes. I don't know why, but the duck itself had no flavor. The skin didn't have that nice crispiness I love when it's browned on a pan. Not sure how they cooked it, but maybe it was sous vide and then put on the plate? I also didn't care for the panzanella as it was too sweet.\n\nWolfe ranch quail breast filled with wild mushrooms ($32) - Potato puree, chard, wild mushrooms. I don't really remember this dish so I can't really comment. I do adore mushrooms and chard. And with quail it should be a winning combo.\n\nNew potatoes tossed in herb butter ($6) - Sea salt. The most disappointing dish of the night. I rarely order potatoes as a side but I was craving some buttery carbs so I decided to get this dish. The potatoes were under cooked and underseasoned. Not good at all! \n\nOlive oil panna cotta ($10) - Sprouted almonds, borage, strawberry white balsamic sauce, rhubarb sorbetto. We ordered this based on the recommendation of our server. I liked this dessert better than the one my dad chose. The panna cotta was nice and silky and creamy. The sauce and sorbetto complimented it well.\n\nMascarpone cheesecake ($10) - Pistachio sponge, poached rhubarb, candied kumquats, mandarin sorbetto. I didn't care for this dessert. The cheesecake was lighter than I expected and didn't hold up to the pistachio and fruit flavors. It didn't feel like the cheesecake was the star of the dish.\n\nOur server was nice and attentive through most of the meal. Remember to ask for bread and butter if you want it. I didn't read the menu til we got our Salumi misti and had to find our server to get some bread to go with the dish. I think if you order it they should ask you if you want bread.\n\nI debated giving this place 3 or 3.5 stars.

While the meats were good & there was tons of variety, I found this dish basically a way to stuff & bloat us so we couldn't enjoy the actual cooked entrees later. I also just noticed the immense price tag on this plate. There was also sourdough, breadsticks, & a preserve/jam that came w/ the meats. However, unless you are a cured meat fanatic &/or get some sort of immense pleasure out of it, I would probably skip this. Or at least go for the half portion.\n\n* Roasted figs - 4 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=_5KAhclzY4UrdeyXe7q1OQ#eixdC-amvYWxutfe1IOjGQ\n(w/ scidumin cheese, toasted hazelnuts, juniper cured lonza, white crane springs' greens. $13)\nReally nice! Every ingredient was intense but it worked well. There was a cheese spread on the side (the texture was like hummus) - it looks innocent but is about 3x stronger than blue cheese. The greens were bitter, the figs fresh & sweet. But when you got it all in one bite, pretty close to perfection.\n\n* Rabaton - 3.5 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=_5KAhclzY4UrdeyXe7q1OQ#5JemtEuuyFwJMI8eUnmtyA\nCross-section:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=_5KAhclzY4UrdeyXe7q1OQ#zMdtKseG39sgLo41nhpI0A\n(herb & spinach ricotta gnocchi, blu di langa fonduta, toasted hazelnuts. $13 half/ $18 whole)\nMy friends didn't like this, but I enjoyed it for being a unique gnocchi! The texture had a little more give than you'd expect, but was still soft. You can actually see pieces of the herb in each piece. The flavor of the white sauce was pretty strong, & it was very viscous.

The pork was super tender & hearty. They kept the green stalks on the turnips & it was incredibly fresh & crunchy.

The artichokes were tender while the greens were fresh and had a nice fragrance to them.\n\nIt was a nice salad even though none of the elements (or the combined flavor combination) were that special or memorable.\n\nI liked my pasta entr\u00e9e more.  I had the agnoli di conglio, which was ravioli filled with devil's gulch rabbit.  The pasta was tossed with black chanterelles, braised greens and a rabbit jus (and then topped with grated parmesan by the server).  The pasta was very good.  It was nicely thick but not doughy and had a good flavor.  The filling was great--meaty and juicy.\n\nI also really liked the sauce.  Pasta sauces can often just be salty (or just one flavor), but the rabbit jus here had several dimensions to it.  There were definitely salty notes, but the red wine flavor really came across and added a surprising and welcomed light sweetness to the dish.\n\nFor dessert, I had the almond brown butter cake that had a center of lemon curd.  The dessert was garnished with toasted meringue, pate de fruit, strawberries, strawberry sauce, and candied lemon peel.  I thought this was a nice dessert and much more refined than what I've had at several other Italian restaurants.\n\nThe brown butter cake was good and moist.  It had a good crust as well as a good flavor.  The lemon curd was also good--creamy and smooth.  I think it got baked a little too much because there was not as much curd in the center as I was expecting.\n\nI thought the garnishes were good.  I really liked the toasted meringue and I liked both the strawberries and strawberry sauce (they were not too tart).\n\nService was okay.

I had heard great things about it, and the Yelp reviews were off the charts. When we entered the restaurant I was given a Happy Birthday card...that was a nice touch!  \n\nOne of the deciding factors in my decision was that the Salumi Misti was on the Big Eat, so naturally, my family started off with one of those.  I have never been a big fan of salumi plates in general, but thought I would try each kind. They were good, but because salami is something that I'm not a particular fan of, one time was enough.  We also ordered that Burrata with sweet corn and cherry tomato crudo.  I work at a cheese shop and know my burratas...this one wasn't curdly (the death knell of mozzarella's) and the cherry tomato crudo was flavorful. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=6Ljap5vwurZCKsRTMsHJIg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=zJqYLy_4xU2ZEeACMkntuw\n\nFor my main dish, I had the Pappardelle with braised short rib ragu.  I was a bit disappointed that the sauce tasted like Thanksgiving gravy...I was expecting something more earthy and meaty.  Aside from that fact, the portion size was perfect and the pasta cooked to perfection.  \n\nDessert was good...so good that my family of 3 ordered 4 and finished every last bite.  I had been dreaming about the doughnuts. They came out warm, in a bag, with a nice \"Happy Birthday\" chocolate stencil on the plate.  The citrus wasn't overpowering, but enough to taste. The Butter Pistachio Cake was good as well. There was some filling in it...almost custard like.  The Burnt Carmel Gelato is to die for...and I've been to Bi-Rite, so don't even try to compare the two!  It was topped with coarse salt which added an addictive crunch to the creamy concoction. By far, my favorite dessert was the Chocolate Torrone.  It had chunks of hazelnuts in it and was served with blackberries on the side...extremely refreshing and a chocolate lovers dream.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=cDJ4bRfKKCnyG_yPlIg0xg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=Mv00nKAsnXI8niNRE_LI0w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=jvPPoc7lGTmUaLEOoVwUyg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=ba5IP3z3Qot0TGwuDE6arA\n\nAll in all we had a good experience.

Our main waiter was definitely a pro -- good stuff. I'll say the menu is fantastic as well, although the pastas and mains were largely meaty. There were plenty of creative and delicious sounding choices, especially on the appetizer list. However, before I got to the main menu, I started with the wine list. Lovely collection, but the wine prices were incredibly pretentious. I know there's a lot of markup for restaurant wine and they need to make some money here, but this list and the prices are bordering on the ridiculous. \n\nWe ordered an Italian wine at the lower-to-mid range of prices. As expected, it was drinkable, but mediocre (actually, appalling for the price, but whatever -- I don't think we would've found better value in a different selection since it was all overpriced).\n\nAs for food: our apps were nice, especially the frito misto, but nothing spectacular. And sorry, but the mains were just so-so. I had a squid ink cavatelli with octopus and urchin that sounded amazing on paper, but just didn't come together for me on the plate. It was tough, unloved, and the entire dish, bland. I am a very low sodium user -- many dishes that would pass the normal palette taste too salty to me.

The octopus was perfectly cooked, tender and with a slight bounce in the bite.\n\n-Pappardelle (wide pasta with slow cooked short rib ragu)- Tasty!

The panna cotta was light and creamy and combined with the huckleberry compote, it had the perfect finish.

My halibut was good, but I still craved more raviolo. Raviolo was truffley, yolky, goodness. For dessert, I had the bonet, which I didn't really like. It was like chocolate pudding with some caramel sauce and whipped cream. Bleh. By the end? I ended up eating dinner part two at another restaurant in the area.\n\nI remember the second time a bit differently, but it could have been from the Bellisimos and champagne. The atmosphere was different. A good different. They served focaccia instead of the hard, tooth-chipping bread they served during dinner. I requested the bar menu in hopes of having some truffled egg toast, but it wasn't on the menu anymore. Sadface. I simply ordered the Catelvetrano olives with the burrata cheese. Holy ravivioli, pat me on the back! You have to try the burrata cheese, you just have to! Wow.\n\nThere was a man next to me who kept me company. He raved about their meatballs, he even let me sample some of his dish. I still thought the burrata cheese was a better choice, though (:\n\nFor dessert, I had chocolate mousse. It was so much better than the bonet, I swear on the holy grail. I let my companion have a taste, to which he said, \"Mmmm!\" He's not even a dessert person, proof that you should get the mousse!\n\nOn top of that, the bartender was this amicable little Spanish man. He was always very attentive to everyone's needs and made sure we were all happy. We talked about Quince, which was how I found out that I had been pronouncing it incorrectly. Boo.\n\nSomeone mentioned finding a cockroach. Well, I found a translucent red bug (about the size of an ant) on the side of my burrata plate.

I wish she could have joined us, she is that awesome! We ate amazing food, lobster and hearts of palm...poached pear...amazing wine (and that was just for starters).

We ended up talking...and I almost tripped up the stairs (that would have been bad)...we chatted some more and I got a Birthday hug from him...holy crap...what a bonus! He was so hot!!!\n\nAllison knew we were skipping dessert and yet brought a plate that said 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate with some amazing lemon sorbetto and a napoleon that was phenominal...followed up by almond nougat and hazelnut chocolate squares. \n\nIf it were not for Allison our evening would not have been the same. The food was incredible but the service and the feeling of that restaurant was superb. I talked with a man who I think was the owner or manager. Either way-he was delightful.

Kids these days are so spoiled....they have to be bribed with iFonez, iPad$ with animation movies, just so that parents (or single parents) can go on dates have the kids to be quiet next to them. Not me, I was an easy cheap date....make the breadstick good, and everything else will be in its right place. iGrissini trumps iPad. Nom Nom Nom Yom Yom Bom Bom Bom GaGa GooGoo this breadstick is da shiznit good good! \n\nBut to keep up with the times, you cannot just have great breadstick anymore. \n\nPerbacco is billed by many food geeks to be one of SF's finest old world style Italian.\nEven if they think is Gangnam Style....this place is otherwise really not my style.\n\nGrissini - shaggadelic great. Eat it plain, or dip in some special sauce (the usual olive oil + ground parsley + garlic goodness). I could clean up a whole plate of these easy, with or without salumi.\n\nButternut squash soup - pretty good, can't go wrong with this one\n\nsalad - forgot the name of it, but see the pic. A beautiful sculpture with a few fruits in it that was pure delightful bliss\n\nand then it went south of there (and not south of the boot)\n\nBraised short rib entree - not my order, but had a sample, and I'm of the conclusion that I prefer my short ribs done Asian style (primarily Korean, Vietnamese, or Cantonese/Chinese or Taiwanese). This red wine braised prep is again not my style\n\nTagliatelle (fresh pasta) with 5 hour pork sugo with wild porcini mushrooms - I purposely skipped the braised short rib paperdelle since a few folks I know ordered it and were not doing the horserider gallop dance afterwards. So I decided to try this pasta dish. Sugo is supposed to be some Italian sauce. Here it is a pork stew mix...and it could possibly change slightly depending on the region, but it's supposed to be like a minced pork (with a puffy texture) simmered with tomato, herbs, amongst other things (supposedly there were porcini mushrooms inside, melted into the mix). Unfortunately there wasn't much in the way of sauce or flavoring...mostly moist minced/ground pork, and fairly one dimensional (mostly a salt profile). No matter how much tossing and mixing of the pork with the pasta, there was a mismatch in general. Grated parmesean didn't improve the dish either. It's perfectly fine if this is the intended approach and execution, but to me this did not work very well. No sauce clinging to the pasta (and still ends up being a salt and pork smear). Something like a Taiwanese style rou zou (stewed minced pork) over brothless noodle, is a lot more robust, in a similar approach (but w/o the tomato). Perhaps a non pasta entree would have been better, but this was a disappointment.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-11-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Go to Perbacco if you need to have a full bar or if someone else is paying ;-)"], "author": "Larry L.", "review": "I enjoyed my meal here and thought the food was pretty good.

She knows I'm a total foodie and is constantly asking if I've tried Perbacco yet. It's been on my list for errm, over a year and the only thing that brought me there was my quest to check #18 Salumi Misti Plate off my 7x7 list...\n\nMy gf and I had reservations at 8 PM last night. Perbacco was bustling when we arrived. We waited for 10 minutes while they got our table ready for us.\n\nFOOD:\n*Breadsticks and Pesto Dipping Sauce (complimentary): The breadsticks were like ordinary breadsticks you would find at the grocery store. They were a bit too crunchy for my liking. The pesto dipping sauce was very light and fresh, but b/c there wasn't parmesan cheese in it (at least I didn't taste any), so it was bland.  \n\n*Bread and butter: The bread was nice, crusty and had a pillowly soft center. The butter was AMAZINGLY good. It definitely had a higher butterfat content than the standard American butter has; it had a velvety texture than melted into each taste bud.\n\n*Salumi Misti Plate (#18 on 7x7): Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, ham, salami, terrines, galantines, and pates, but I wasn't \"wowed\" by the Salumi plate. There were about 8 different kinds of house-cured meats, none of which were explained to us, so we didn't know what was what. Other than the pate, all the other meats just tasted like different types of fat and lard. Thank goodness the pickled gherkin, cauliflower and our chianti help balanced out the oiliness. \n\n*Crudo Hamachi: Three thick slices of hamachi drizzled in oil and sprinkled with shaved fennel, serrano pepper and tangerines. Although the hamachi was buttery, it had a pungent fishy smell to it, which I found to be odd. There was no \"fishy\" taste which perhaps  the kick from the serrano pepper and the sweet/tartness from the tangerines masked?\n\n*Pappardelle w/ Shortrib Ragu: After seeing rave reviews on YELP, I was so excited to try this dish. But, when I finally got to, it was a let down. The handmade pappardelle was excellent and was cooked to a perfect al-dente and the short-rib was very tender. However, the sauce was a HUGE disappointment b/c it did NOT tie the dish together. I expected it to be somewhat like a marsala; rich and savory sauce packed w/ flavor, but it was nothing like it. It was flavorless, watery and did not adhere to the pappardelle or shortrib\n\n*Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder w/ Chanterelles and Fingerling Potatoes: The pork shoulder was fork tender, but it was evident that the accompanying sauce was just drizzled on the side as opposed to the pork being braised in it b/c it was flavorless. The chanterelles were tender, as were the potatoes and that's the only good thing I can say about the dish.\n\nDRINKS:\n*Hendrick's Tonic: Nice and strong w/ a hint of cucumber flavoring. A very clean and crisp cocktail. \n*2004 Chianti, Riserva, Riserva, Vigna Misciano, Borgo Scopeto (Sangiovese): Smooth, light, fruity notes, and a very acidic aftertaste which helped balanced out the oiliness from some the dishes.\n\nPRICES:\n*Apps: $8-12\n*Pastas: $11-14 for an appetizer portion and $16-$19 for an entr\u00e9e portion\n*Entrees: $18-$26\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was very friendly but not very attentive. It took us about 20 minutes to flag her down before we could order our bottle of wine. However, the busboys always made sure our water was filled. Our food came out in 20-25 minute increments which lead to total dining time of 2 hours.\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR:\nPerbacco is much larger than it appears to be from the outside. The d\u00e9cor is very simple and clean; red brick walls to the left, marble floor, light auburn ceiling, ivory walls, white linens, brown booths and seating and large vases of flowers scattered throughout.\n\nPerbacco was very busy for a Tuesday night; hence it was very loud. As the other reviews stated, this is NOT a date spot. This is more for  pow-wow lunches and business dinners. \n\nI didn't like the fact that you the bathroom is downstairs and you have to walkdown a long flight of stairs to get there which is challenging with heels after several cocktails/glasses of wine. \n\nCROWD:\nStuffy mature FIDI crowd dressed in suits and ties.\n\nPARKING: \nRelatively easy street parking after 6 PM. \n\nI'm glad I was able to check #18 off my 7x7 list, but highly doubt I would return to Perbacco. Although the dishes were well-prepared, none of the dishes stood out b/c they were flavorless.

Not everything reaches the heights, but the food is complex and unusual, and therefore worth the extra star.\n\nThe four of us shared the salumi misti platter. Mostly ordinary (the bar has been raised so high by so many places these days; we are fortunate in the Bay Area!), but loved the rillette. So often this is an overdone, overlarge, overrich spread, but Perbacco's is light, fluffy, and a perfect starter. Next time I would skip all the other salume and just have this with their lovely housemade breads.\n\n-- Beet salad with mandarin orange: very good\n-- Octopus roasted with cranberry beans in tomato concasse: outstanding!\n-- Burrata cheese with roasted butternut squash and pears, cress, herb vinaigrette: a Grade B. Chunks were too large, textures too similar, flavors too mild. Squash hadn't caramelized enough to add its usual sweet notes.\n-- Ligurian fisherman's soup. Good, but VERY salty\n-- Fritto misto. Batter shattered off. Green beans & fennel should have been cut shorter. But the aioli was superb, saved the whole dish.\n-- Vitello tonnato. Always superb, and we always order it. Tasted like they sneaked some anchovies into the tonnato sauce, which we heartily approve of. Luscious!\n\nEntrees:\n-- Risotto with local porcini mushrooms, caramelized onions, toma della rocca cheese. This was a very different risotto preparation. Compared to the usual pale-colored lemon or chicken risotto, this was more like a \"short ribs\" of risotto, dark and tangy. Spouose thought it was odd, but I thought it was fabulous.\n-- Ravioli filled with roasted butternut squash, toasted hazelnuts, and pomegranate seeds. A beautiful dish, both in looks and taste. Very generous on the half-size serving.\n-- Pan-roasted monkfish. Very good, but the veggies (previously always reliable) were al dente, too hard to eat. Had I known this I would have insisted the plate be returned to the kitchen to be redone, but I didn't find out until afterwards.\n-- Liberty Farm duck breast, warm salad of brussels sprout leaves, persimmon, dates, pancetta. Very well executed; sauce was more savory than sweet which is what I prefer.\n\nDesserts were good, not great.

We had to motion for the waiter to come over and tell us what each item is. He took the time explaining each meat but I could barely hear him since the noise level in here was pretty high. There were 5 different house cured salumi and 2 kinds of pate on the plate. I really liked the salumi di coto with its noticeable dots of fat. The prosciutto cured in red wine was definitely the saltiest of all, so I put some quince jelly to tone it down. The cornichons were a fave of my BFF! Both of us didn't want to touch the lardo because it just looked unappetizing.\n\nAbsolutely get the Rabaton, it's a truffled-herb gnocchi with roasted mushroom sugo. He kept raving about these soft pillows! This dish is a good choice for vegetarians as it is very filling.\n\nI ordered the Tajarin. Imagine hand-cut tagliatelle, pork sugo cooked for 5 hours crowned with just the right amount of parmigiano reggiano.  A simple dish but incredibly good. \n\nOh, dessert. \n\nThe pistachio panna cotta with pomegranate gelatina and pistachio cookies were more than welcome in my mouth.

The duck tasted great but was a little hard to break down to eat.  \n\nThe last course was the best, thanks to pastry chef Suzanne LaFleur.  We had the honey panna cotta, with fennel pollen and honeycomb.  The panna cotta had a luscious texture that made it move like it had a mind of its own.  The flavor was clearly honey without being over powering.  The honey comb which accompanied the panna cotta was crispy and a wonderful compliment of textures.  \n\nWe also had the gianduja, which is a dark chocolate and hazelnut prailine bar, which is served with a caramelized cocoa nib gelato.  Where the panna cotta was delicate, this was the opposite rich and imposing.  The flavors of hazelnut and chocolate were meant to be together.  Pastry Chef LaFleur marries them in a way that punches you in the face with flavor.  Each bite is better than the last.\n\nOverall an amazing meal, but the last course was the best.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-08-09"}, {"excerpts": ["I was looking forward to a very nice working lunch with a co-worker and Perbacco was so pleasant.

Our server was friendly, full of great suggestions and always there when we needed her. The Italian wine list was good but would have benefited from a Super Tuscan or two (La Parrina is nice~). We ended up with a couple of rounds of martinis, a bottle of wine, several rounds of appetizers (the cured meats and the stuffed dates were fabulous) and dessert.\n\nI think some of that too new, too hip, too trendy attitude that kills cool places in this town is starting to melt away into something still hip but comfortable and friendly.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-09-06"}, {"excerpts": ["R volunteered Perbacco and ", "I believe this truly enhances the eating process and Perbacco did an excellent job of this.

I mean, how am I suppose to support a pancake arranged on a dish Denny's level of style and presentation?\n\nMy good friend's friend was visiting from AZ for work and since I had missed connecting with her for several years, I had to delay my dinner plans with J and met at Schroeder's.  R volunteered Perbacco and since I had never been, jumped at the chance of trying a new place, plus to possibly review and check out the interior of the establishment.\n\nFirst, let me state that I am all about interiors and ambiance.  I believe this truly enhances the eating process and Perbacco did an excellent job of this.  The establishment is a sleek and modern rendition of Northern Italian hospitality, echoed in the use of warm neutrals and lighting floored firmly by the rustic brick wall behind the bar.  Good thing I was in my suit, because 99% of the people here were in coats, and it must have been the destination spot for all the good looking people in suits from the Financial District.\n\nR ran into a friend of his standing at the bar, who apparently knew the staff and the owner, and fantastically procured a banquette for us when one opened up.  Since I had already ruined my slight alcoholic tolerance earlier at Schroeder's, I declined to partake in anything special here, but did elect the Navarro Pinot Noir Juice, priced beautifully at $5.  They presented this in a wine glass and suddenly, people thought I was sipping some Pinot.  Brilliant.\n\nOnce seated, I was too busy checking out the interior and distracted by the group of suits behind us making loud discussion about an X-box game I had played in earnest (Gears of War, come on now!) but my dear friends ordered items off the menu upon the advice of our server, who was actually quite learned with the items listed and he advised that we start off with several of the appetizers (personally, they all looked quite appealing to me.)\n\nT h e O r d e r\n\nSALAME - NOSTRANO / FINOCCHIONA / SANGUINATO / TOSCANO / SALAME COTTO D'ASTI\n\nA fantastic platter for the virgin to antipasti and all cured vivid meats.  Arranged artfully, the meats were arranged by type and came accompanied with little pieces of crostini as well as a sweet honey type marmalade and little gherkins.  R's special Perbacco friend questioned the use of forks, so I used my fingers to select pieces of the Toscano/Nostrano/Finocchiona (I'm a sucker for these extreme rush of tastes piqued by the curing process, the wine-garlic-herbs mix) slices gingerly and nibbled on the very rich and salty meat.\n\nHAMACHI / SHAVED FENNEL / BLOOD ORANGE ESSENCE / OLIVE OIL\n\nExquisite and thick slices of the buttery hamachi, topped with shaved fennel, olive oil and slices of jalapeno peppers.  A beautifully textured piece of a gourmand's dream.  Remember to redip the hamachi into the olive oil for smooth transfer of senses.\n\nBURRATA CHEESE / MARINATED FRIARELLI PEPPERS / WHITE ANCHOVY / ARUGULA\n\nResembled a little bag of fresh mozzarella, but the burrata cheese was milky smooth on the outside with a slight ricotta texture on the inside.  A mild tasting cheese, collecting a bit of the cheese in addition to the bitter arugula and the savory peppers and anchovy brought a fresh burst of a combination of tastes in my mouth.  Exquisite.\n\nFRITTO MISTO OF ROCK SHRIMP / GREEN BEANS / OLIVES / FENNEL / LEMON AIOLI\n\nNot the surprising course of the bunch.  Think tempura style, but the Japanese version offering a bit more on the crunchy and less oily side.  However, I was in love with the little fried balls of rock shrimp.  The lemon aioli was slightly bland, perhaps in due part that the lemon flavor was a little too mild for my tastes.  I ended up dipping it into the sweet marmalade that accompanied the cured meats plate. Fried green beans were not too entertaining, but anything fried tastes good these days.\n\nThis impressive display of vibrant textures as well as bursting flavors and the expert melding of greens and peppers to fold rather than diminish existing surprises to our palate.  The dinner was made even more enjoyable with Umberto Gibin, the part owner, assisting in the deliver of our plates.\n\nI had to leave early from this wonderful presentation to meet up with a coworker, but will return to partake in the entree portion of their menu.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been impressed with artful Northern Italian fare and with the surprise introduction enhanced by the excellent service, Perbacco has restored my faith.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-03-12"}, {"excerpts": ["We're going to Perbacco instead, have you been there?\"\n", "\"Nope,\" I replied.

Apologies to all my good friends here that I temporarily lost touch with on Yelp.  The past few weeks have been absolutely crazy and my father's health has deteriorated greatly in so many ways.  He was hospitalized for ten days and is home now, but his dementia, alzheimer's, and poor health has been quite a test for us all.  On a good note, I used some of this hospitalization time as an opportunity to treat my poor saint of a girlfriend who hasn't had a night out in ages (since my dad ordinarily cannot be left alone and has to be watched all the time now, we normally cannot go out together at the same time at night).  If we weren't visiting him at the hospital, we were out and about, dining and drinking.  He is home now so things are back to normal and we absolutely can't get out or get away together at night now, but during that little time we had off, I really tried to make those nights special for her and show her how much I appreciate her and everything she does.  Thanks to Perbacco, I was able to.  Anyway, on to the review!\n\nThe review:\n\nAs everyone knows, I have always loved Perbacco and as such, it only seems logical that this meal turned out to be the most memorable of all the nice dinners and lunches that my girlfriend and I had together recently.  She has been so wonderful to me and my dad and with him temporarily hospitalized, I finally had the opportunity to take her out to dinner, something that has been absolutely impossible otherwise.  \n\nUpon walking in the door, was happy to see that Carla was working behind the bar (nice new haircut!)...she really makes the place and was fantastic as always.  The hostess and people working the front desk were really great too.

It's not just about location either, it's about a place with synergy that is run right and excels in so many ways.  Lake Park Bistro in Milwaukee overlooking Lake Michigan and Flagstaff House in Boulder, CO share a similar magic for me, every time I walk in.\n\nIn addition to the cocktails and then wines, we shared an appetizer of Vitello Tonato - slow roasted veal, lemon and albatore sauce, capers and arugula. She then had the Pappardelle which was wide ribbon pasta ribbons, slow-cooked short rib ragu, roasted cippoline, and grated horseradish. I had the Tajarin which was handcut tagliatelle, 5 hour cooked pork sugo, and porcini mushrooms.\n\nThe waiter we had, Brett, was first-rate and he really added to the experience.  Extremely professional, yet at the same time, genuine and real, he had the calm manner of a seasoned professional and his efforts made for an exceptional dining experience.  When I inquired about available roeros, he instantly suggested a special off-menu Trinita nebbiolo roero ($98) that turned out to be the perfect complement to our meal.  \n\nFor our main course, she had the Beef Short Rib Stracatto with root vegetable passatina, braised escarole, and honey glazed cipoline and carrots. I had the Striped Bass with wild mushroom and Jerusalem artichoke ragout and truffle jus. I specifically asked for no side of spinach and they were more than happy to accomodate.  Looking back, I just realized that I forgot to order the additional side of fingerling potatoes with lardo we wanted, but just as well, we were stuffed anyway. We then had a really nice valpolicella dessert wine (nice!!!) and then she had the Bonte, a wild harvested chocolate custard with whipped cream and amaretti. I had the Sformatino, a carmelized milk chocolate mousse with dark chocolate glaze, cocoa almond streusel, and creme inglese. No complaints here...it was a pricey, but most memorable dining experience for both of us, especially for her as it was her first time here. \n\nOne of my friends, upon hearing that I spent $300 on dinner for two here took a look at the online menu and was surprised that I spent so much.  I explained that we had some nice wines and that when there are as many outstanding items on the menu, it wasn't hard to do at all.\n\nPerbacco...just the mere mention of  the name gives me a warm feeling and makes me dream of heavenly Italian food, celestial pastas with slow cooked sauces, and fine wines in a tasteful, romantic setting.

To me, if it makes my eyes close as I savor the flavors in my mouth, this place is getting at least 3 stars. As it turned out, the Tajarin pasta was cooked perfectly - a bit al dente to make it springy and pleasantly chewy. The thick, melt-in-your-mouth pork ragu sauce added a most excellent compliment to the pasta. I had to exercise diligent self-control as to not hork down the plate of pasta and lick the plate, as I was on a date of sorts.\n\nThough a bit on the pricey side (one plate of pasta, a bottle of wine, and dessert) came out to a little over $100, it's definitely worth your splurge fund when you feel like you deserve a heart-warming pasta treat.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-12-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I've been to Perbacco quite a few times and it has generally been at least very good.

For those of you who don't come to these type of restaurants often or if you dont' have culinary experience, heed this warning: you will have a hard time reading the menu too. Words like passatina and passato frequent the menu often and I still don't know what they mean. I felt like I needed a dictionary or an italian-english translator to decipher the menu. Just what are they trying to prove -.- Anyways...\n\nFood: We shared appetizers and pasta dishes and there were dishes that stuck out to me. First was this plate of fried food. It had string beans and what I thought was calamari but my boyfriend's dad said it was fried shrimp. It had the right texture and a great taste. \n\nSecond were these pasta noodles with short rib ragu. The noodles honestly tasted like soupless ramen noodles but the lamb ragu had a great strong flavor. \n\nThird was the gnocchi. It was the first time i've had gnocchi so I\"m not sure how they are supposed to taste but it wasn't my cup of tea. It had a mushy texture and a forgettable taste. Anyone want to tell me if gnocchi is supposed to be mushy?\n\nFourth was the main entree I ordered. Duck breast whatever. It was really juicy but the taste was also forgettable.\n\nFifth was the hazelnut cookies. Again weird texture. Half the table liked it and half the table didn't. I wasn't that big of a fan. It was as chewy as nougat is which I think is kind of weird for a cookie.\n\nSixth was the chocolate mousse which I thought was the best part of the night. The chocolate wasn't overly sweet, it was actually pretty perfect for me. Satisfied my sweet tooth but didn't make me reach for the water cup. \n\nSeventh were the breadsticks. It's actually the first time i've ever had those thin hard crunchy breadsticks, like you see in italian restaurants on television all the time. I thought the flavor was great and it was even better when you dipped it in the sauce. \n\nService: GREAT. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. We were asked if we wanted to hang our coats up in the closet. The waiter was very knowledgeable and was able to give me recommendations for drinks and for the main entree. Our waters were constantly refilled and when we got up to go to the bathroom, our napkins were refolded for us. \n\nUnfortunately, I've had great service and great food at other restaurants so Meh is as good as this review is going to get. \n\nI would give this restaurant another try because supposedly they have a different menu daily so maybe different dishes will prompt me to give a better review.

Sure it's delicious, but it doesn't take a premier restaurant to serve it (and, I'm a bit spoiled by having Lucca down the street from my house). And, while the VEAL TRIPE was perfectly cooked, the composition of the dish was a bit uninspired and lacked seasoning. \n\nSince, as I said, I was ready to eat the world, we tackled 3 pastas - the AGNOLOTTI DAL PLIN, the TAJARIN, and the RABATON. There was nothing especially memorable about the latter 2 - both were executed well, but I wasn't impressed by the flavors. When I eat ricotta gnocchi, I want to think I'm eating a cloud, and the Rabaton fell short of cloudliness. However, the Agnolotti (a dish they are known for) was everything I could've wanted and more. As soon as we dove into that dish, our lively conversation came to a dead silence - there was no room for words in the face of that rich, complex flavor. This was one of the top 5 pasta dishes I've had in the City, and if I was ever to go back, would be the only thing I'd need to order to feel completely satisfied. \n\nWith so many choices on the menu, I'm sure everyone can find something that makes their heart sing.

Rounding out to one of the best lunches I've ever had, my experience consisted of 3 appetizers, a pasta main dish, and cafe latte.  \n\nLocated conveniently 5 minutes away from my work, Perbacco surpassed my really high expectations.  With classy, yet modern decor inside, and hip, knowledgeable, yet, not pretentious wait staff, I can see this being one of my favorite Italian spots to go to.\n\nStarting off with a slow roasted veal carpaccio in a lemon/tuna sauce, I was impressed right off the bat.  Not being a huge fan of veal or capers in general, I was pleasantly surprised by how tender and flavorful (without the typical vealish gamey taste) this dish was and how well it went with the sauce.\n\nFried rock shrimp was the next order of business, where there wasn't too much batter, or too little shrimp with each bite.  This also came in a lemon sauce (aioli) as well as some other fried bits.  Definitely couldn't complain about this dish.\n\nThe seared squid on a bed of arugula was the last appetizer that was demolished.  I especially enjoyed how the arugula nor the salted squid overpowered the other.  There was a very delicate balance in this dish that made it juuuuuuust right.\n\nFor my main, I had the langaroli with braised short rib.  This was a decision I had my server make for me when deciding between this, the tagliatelle and the parpadelle (all of which I'm convinced are amazing).  She mentioned that it was new on the menu and that it was a good choice, so I went with it.  In the end, who can really complain about pasta filled with braised short rib.  There were some bites that may have bordered on being too salty, but the succulence of the short rib brought it all back.  Of course, the pasta (smaller ravioli like) was perfectly al dente, and the portion was just right....assuming there is a correct portion after eating 3 appetizers.\n\nTo top it off, I had to deny the creme fraiche panna cotta and settle for a latte, as I still needed to be functional at work.  And, to one up themselves again, the latte came with extra foam and milk if we desired.  WHO DOES THIS?!\n\nPerbacco, you've earned a special place in my stomach.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-05-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Perbacco's breadsticks are oh so addictive.

We decided to have a dinner date on a Wednesday before I headed to my 6:30pm class and I chose this place for its proximity to the BART station. We planned to meet at 5; I arrived at 4:45pm. I was told by the hostess that they did not start dinner seating until 5:30. The hostess politely inquired if I were looking for Barbacco, which, for its convincingly similar name, must be a frequent source of mix-ups. I was not; and decided to grab a bar table in the corner near the front window to wait for my bf to arrive. It was pretty empty around 5pm but I am glad I snagged that table when I did, because the FiDi after-work crowd filtered in soon after. The bf arrived at 5:15; by 5:30, the entire bar area was crowded to the point of an almost-uncomfortable capacity. \n\nWe asked for menus so that we could choose our main dishes and put in our orders so that we could start our dinners as soon as possible. The menus for the night had not even finished printing yet, but our waitress was kind enough to bring them over as soon as they were ready, around 5:25. We ordered our mains and decided to start with the salumi plate. The salumi plate was all that it is hyped up to be in these reviews and more - the fatty selections were incredibly flavorful and decadent. \n\nI had the duck breast and the bf had the rabbit. These were both presented on our plates in two distinct preparations, which was refreshing as not only did it showcase the chef's abilities, but also we were able to experience our duck and rabbit in more than one way each. This was a refreshing take, as it was more interesting to my palate to be able to taste my duck in different textures and tastes that were overall complementary to each other. \n\nThe wine list is extensive and solid. I was pleased to discover a sizeable selection of rieslings. I had a very good $12 glass of riesling, but the name of it escapes me. My bf had a bottled anchor steam. Perbacco does not have any beers on tap, unfortunately. \n\nOur impromptu dinner date meal cost us about $90 before tip. Definitely not a place to frequent on a regular basis, but definitely nice for an after-work pick-me-up or a celebration once in awhile.\n\nPros:\n-Very solid and satisfying Italian main dishes \n-Beyond decadent salumi plate\n-Extensive wine list\n-Helpful and attentive waitress (despite the unyielding crowd)\n-Proximity to Embarcadero BART\n\nCons:\n-Very, very loud - the acoustics in the restaurant are not suited for comfortable across-the-table talking (not suitable for a first date, for sure!)\n-The elbowing FiDi after-work crowd \n-Not being able to get dinner seating until 5:30 (I would appreciate being able to sit by 5pm for dinner)", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-04-25"}, {"excerpts": ["We were initially going to try and hit up 3 items/places on the list that are all within close proximity to my office (Alfreds, Perbacco, and Tadich), but only made it to Perbacco and Tadich Grill.

What most interested me in this establishment is that they serve typical dishes from Piemonte  (my home region in Italy) but with a Californian touch.  Pointless to say that I had great expectations (and some fears too).\n\nAs a great start, we got homemade grissini with a typical flavourful parsley-based green dip (Bagna Verde) that Piemontesi normally use as sauce for veal tongue or boiled veal meat.\n\nThe menu itself is rather interesting: I particularly like the possibility of combining two or three different pasta dishes (I wish more Italian restaurants offered such a possibility, since I often have hard times in deciding which promising homemade pasta to pick).  No chance I could have missed this heavenly possibility. After a good looking and flavourful appetizer with raw yellowtail, shaved porcini and celery, our main choice fell upon the following pasta trio:\n\n1- herb Maltagliati with lamb ragu', peas, ricotta di pecora and mint: excellent pasta, overkilling sauce with too much on it. I honestly find ricotta and lamb (despite its nicely melting-in-mouth texture, by the way) a rather weird combination, but I liked the mint (exactly the opposite as my gf ...);\n\n2-agnolotti al coniglio with vermouth based sauce and fruit mustard:\nthose agnolotti were a real pasta masterpiece and the sauce was original, even though the reduction didn't fully kill the alcoholic taste. Forgivable sin, though, that didn't affect too much the marvellous resulting dish.\n\n 3- tajarin (typical Piedmontese taglierini) with 5 hour pork sugo and porcini: if you wonder  why letting the sugo cook for 5 hours, this dish gives you a convincing answer. What a fantastic taste! Again, another delicious pasta.\n\nDesserts were good (but not exceptional) and they came in huge portions:  \n1- buttermilk panna cotta with a lemonish taste, raspberries and a touch of fruity granita;\n2- ricotta mousse, a lemonish cake (I can't recall the name) and Lambrusco marinated strawberries. \n\nGood wines and beers (I got a Piedmontese Menabrea) too.\n\nPerbacco offers a seriously good deal considering both quality and quantity (the real surprise, in my opinion) for the price you pay.

Perfect service, perfect meals to share, and perfect company to enjoy this A+ dining experience!\"  I'd be hard pressed to recall a better evening of dining out than what I experienced last night, which was a tie with Zuni Cafe back in the spring so I guess my two favorite restaurants just now happen to be in San Francisco.\n\nWorking out here in the Bay Area as frequently as I have been of late I seem to go through fits and starts.  Some trips I'm all about going back to the places I've tried and liked, but some trips are like the last two weeks when every new experience seems to unfold some hidden gem that I'm just discovering for the first time.  Writing this just now I can't gush enough about how much I love this city so forgive me if you detect more than a whiff of hyperbole.\n\nMeeting up with a former work colleague whom I've not seen in about six years and her beau, it was on me to choose the restaurant since she'd only moved to town (from New York City) just two weeks ago.  Needless to say she wanted something on par with what she'd grown accustomed to in New York.  While I thought I was making a reservation at BARBacco where I'd dined a few months back, I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at PERBacco and realized my mistake and that I would be dining at the more established big sister restaurant.\n\nFirst the service: I wish I'd gotten my waiter's name so I could rave about him personally.  As happened at Zuni Cafe, he let us take our time as we were so busy talking we'd barely perused the menu after ordering a couple of drinks.  Since we were all three newcomers he took great pride in explaining the menu and insisting that everything on the menu is special when one of us asked if there were any specials.  Indeed he was right as every dish on the menu had allure, especially the homemade pastas and house cured charcuterie.  When we noticed that we could order two or three pastas to share for the table, he recommended we get two salads to start, two pastas, and two entrees.  \n\nWe had no trouble choosing the two salads, one was roasted beets on a testa (head cheese?) remoulade and the other roasted figs with burrata, arugula and a balsamic glaze. The pastas all looked great and I might have wanted a filled ravioli or gnocchi but we had the papardelle with beef ribs and the the molto Italiano strand pasta with pesto and crushed cherry tomatoes.  Given that all of the pastas are made on the premises I'm sure there was no going wrong. And rather than serving the the dish family style, we were each given a plate with a portion of each.  The papardelle was certainly my favorite and I guess I had a taste for beef that night because we also ordered the beef rib straccato.  No one is a bigger fan of red meat braised in wine than yours truly.  I love making it at home and I love eating it when I go out.  This version came not just with a bread crumb crust but a bone marrow bread crumb crust.  Perfecto!\n\nFor the second entree we were to share, our waiter pulled a delightful trick I've never experienced at another restaurant before.  Since we couldn't decide among the salmon, the duck or the rabbit, he said let me surprise you. We were all somewhat taken aback by the proposition, but of course he promised that they were each excellent.  That we went along with his suggestion is testament to his overall competence as a waiter and how deftly he orchestrated a gratifying experience.  And of course he chose a bottle of Italian red close to the flavor profile of our consensus wine of pinot noir that would have gone with any of the three but again seemed extra special because he chose it for us.  I'm not sure how he came to decide on the duck for us, but I couldn't have been more pleased even though I was hoping for the rabbit.  What was especially delicious was the the accompaniment of roasted apples and brussel sprouts that made for such a succulent complement to the duck.\n\nIt's rare that service and meal are so perfectly combined in one evening.  Part of the magic was of course catching up with an old friend in a setting new to both of us. But our waiter took the pulse of our table and just made sure we'd have a wonderful evening.

I would not normally consider it as a place where you'd have a casual dinner date with your sisters and your new baby niece...\n\nMy sisters, one of whom had a baby very recently, and I wanted to get together for a nice dinner.  We chose Perbacco because the menu was scrumptious!  What we hadn't realized was that Perbacco is a really nice restaurant with fancy, well-heeled patrons, and beautiful decor.  I felt a little embarassed trying to fit my 3.5-month old niece at our table, because the high chair wouldn't work with her car-seat, but the host and the servers were really accomodating and we managed to make the baby comfortable in a regular chair.\n\nNot a single person stared at us in horror, which was really surprising, even when my sister started to breastfeed!  I give Perbacco 5 stars because it serves delicious food without any pretension.\n\nThe food was beautifully plated, and just plain yummy.

How much more reasonable can you get?!?\n\nEverything we had was simply delicious, and I would order it all again, though I'll likely venture to other items on the menu because there are so many!  The burrata cheese app was especially noteworthy, as it just melts in your mouth.  I also love how our server automatically separated the pasta onto three dishes so we didn't have to divvy up the portions ourselves.

The decor is beautiful and service is quite attentive.  But you look around and everyone looks like they're on a business lunch with their button-downs and fake smiles.\n\nIt's a shame because the food really is good.  The breadsticks with pesto are a nice touch and the warm focaccia that follows is amazing (although it will leave your hands quite oily).\n\nFor starters, the beet salad was excellent (but a bit small in size).  The client had the heirloom salad which looked amazing.  If I was only with friends, I could just reach over and ... doh!\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the tajarin, a dishfrom the Piemonte area of Italy for which Perbacco is known.  The handcut tagliatelle resembles wavy ramen and 5-hour cooked pork sugo was a like ground beef poured in the center of it.  Although it looked rather eh, the texture was al dente and quite good.  The sugo was nice but a little bland and after pretty heavy.  It would have been nice to get some veggies or crunchy nibbles to balance the heavy starch and meat.  I remember getting the agnolotti dal plin the last time ... but can't remember if I enjoyed it or not.  Everyone else at non-pasta entrees which looked much more complex (the hangar steak, the halibut) but also looked like what you might be able to get at other restaurants.\n\nI may have to come back (maybe for a weekend) when the suit & tie crowd is far, far away and try another pasta dish soon.  Or I'll probably soon forget how the tajarin tasted (much like the forgotten agnolotti).", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-08-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Perbacco is top notch for food, service and atmosphere for happy hour, date or celebration.   \n", "Amazing Italian wine list that your sommelier will help you make heads or tales of.

Once we were seated, we were shown to Perbacco's private dining room--unexpected and very nice!

One of my major concerns about taking two families out for dinner alleviated!\n\nWe ordered their fantastic salumi platter for the table, and when it arrived we were told that the chef decided to give us two platters that contained everything he offered rather than two platters with duplicate items. Wow. Not only great food, but great consideration in thinking about optimizing our experience. Not surprisingly, we had a great time sampling and comparing everything served--a wonderful start.\n\nWe had some real wine connoisseurs at the table, and the sommelier  showed up and dealt with three people simultaneously making demands on his wine list. He handled us adeptly and we ended up with some incredible wines: some that he recommended given our food orders and a description of the kind of wine that we liked, and some varietals that we specifically pointed that we wanted to try.\n\nMost of the table was from out of town but had sophisticated palates, and they were all impressed with what they were served.

Does that mean that Perbacco is on par with Taco Bell? No. I just hold them to different standards, and in both categories (\"fast food\" and \"finer dining\"), both establishments fall dramatically short of satisfaction. \n\nFOOD - not so much. \n1) Salad - I got a salad that had a strong citrus element, with slices of grapefruit, I believe. The fruit slices had lots of internal skin, meaning that I had to pick at it and rip is apart to make it satisfactorily edible, and there were SEEDS left in it, which, in my book, is inexcusable. Maybe that's just my tastes, but.. you're a restaurant that's attempting to create good food and give it a decent presentation... don't lay it out so that your customers have to finish the basic prep work for you when the food hits the table. \n\n2) Main - buckwheat pasta\nI ordered a pasta dish that normally comes with prosciutto, but  had them skip the ham. It tasted good, but came with slices of potato (??!??!?@??!?) in it. I'm sorry, but if I'm ordering a CARB-BASED entree, I really don't need extra starches tossed in. It made no sense. \n\nCHOICES - \nAs I recall, there was literally ONE vegetarian option on the menu for entrees and most of the desserts were laden with alcohol, which I detest. Unfortunately, you couldn't request an alcohol-free version, since it was cooked in. \n\nPALATE DOMINATION\nI think what left the worst impression on me, regarding the food, was that the menu seemed dominated by one palate that was very particular - really rustic meat oriented. There were plenty of choices on the menu, but they all seemed to come from the same vein of culinary style, one that, as a pregnant woman, I clash with. Even the fish was unworkable for me at the moment. It seemed like the head chef created this menu to please his or her whims, without considering the varied tastes of their clientle.\n\nThe customers shouldn't have to hunt the menu to find what they can \"settle\" with and then have to have modified in the kitchen. Ideally, a good menu should offer a few options for a variety of types of palates. \n\nATMOSPHERE: \n1. UNBELIEVABLE NOISY - great for after work drinks and apps, wind-down socialization. Horrendous if you want to have actual conversation at your table. \n\n2. CIGARETTE SMOKE - We were seated on the third floor, yet somehow cigarette smoke wafted up and emanated around the dining room for a good 20 minutes. Given the location of the front door versus the staff area in the basement, I'm thinking it's a lot more likely the smoke came from a staff member having a smoke break, rather than someone out front. The bottom line is that a staff member on the third floor should have noticed and immediately had the situation addressed. \n\nSERVICE\nThis is a pet peeve... If I'm eating at a relatively fine-dining location, I want my service to be unnoticeable.*** The ideal is minimal interaction with the table, getting orders, etc, and then seamlessly refilling waters, beverages, delivering food, removing empty plates in a way that is unremarkable. \n\nSadly, our waitress was of the \"hey folks, welcome to my show\" mentality, so we had constant interruptions from her that were wholly unnecessary - interrupting us in mid-sentence to inquire if we wanted more to drink, if we were DONE with our food that we were still eating, etc. Ridiculous. Also, it was all delivered with an overly engaging, disruptive and peppy attitude, like she was inserting herself into our dinner company and trying to join our table. \n\nThe rest of the staff was equally bad - the busboys literally hovered near the table to try to swoop in the moment a fork was set down. \n\nThey seemed to be rushing us to turn the table, but we were by no means lingering and wasting time. \n\nBottom line - major disappointment. I will NOT be going back, even if someone else is footing the bill. \n\n***I worked for many years as a waitress in a variety of restaurants, from fine dining to pizza joints.

But after a second visit with significantly better service but much worse food, we just can't join the chorus of praise.\n\nAll through both meals, we noticed, over and over again, problems of size and intensity. Too much, not enough, too much, not enough... like some practical joke played by the kitchen at our expense.\n\nFirst, the overkill: On our initial visit, we loved the burrata appetizer, but quickly tired of its unctuous, truffled intensity. A strongly flavored salad was another tastebud-killer: All the components hung together well, but by the time he was halfway through, the richness of chestnut honey, gorgonzola, and hazelnuts was just exhausting. On our return trip, a beet-and-arugula salad offered just too much of the same flavors, over and over, without relief.\n\nNext, the underwhelming flavors: Although the feta-like Castelmagno cheese on that same beet-and-arugula salad provided too much salt, the beets themselves were nearly flavorless. On our second visit, a pasta didn't appear to have any salt in the dough, and had been dressed with unsalted butter. A cauliflower soup was perfectly velvety but didn't actually taste like cauliflower.\n\nAnd then, unpredictable portions: We loved the tajarin (hand-cut tagliatelle) with pork-and-porcini sugo as a middle course on our first visit, but an entre portion that we ordered on our second visit was only a smidge larger. Similarly, the sides accompanying all three main courses we ordered (over the course of 2 visits) were so skimpy that you wished the chef would just offer his entrees a la carte and be done with it.\n\nAnd frankly, Perbacco's entrees are its weakest link.

Once last December, another time about a month ago, and a third time this past Friday.  I have to say, I have never had a bad meal or had bad service at this place.\n\nThe first time around, my husband and I went for my birthday.  We had the salumi appetizer, w/c was very good - good variety and flavor.  I had a fish entree w/c was good, but the standout was my husband's shortrib entree.  So flavorful and rich without being overly greasy.  \n\nThe second time around, my hubby and I went w/ my sis and her hubby.  We also shared the salumi misti plate and the portions were very generous, and also had the local anchovy crudo, which was nice and briny but not too salty.  We also brought our own wine and ordered a bottle off the regular menu.  The sommalier was great, they were not snooty or condescending, which can sometimes happen when you bring your own wine (it helped I think that the wine we brought was unusual and not normally available to restaurants).  My hubby ordered the rabbit, which meh, I am not a fan of game, so I didn't taste it.  Apparently it was good, but I\"ll take his word for it.  I had the roasted chicken w/c was absolutely luscious.  It was juicy and flavorful.  Yum.  I loved how attentive the service was, not too pushy and hovering, but always there whenever you needed them.\n\nLast Friday, I went back w/ my girl friends, one of whom was desperately craving good prosciutto.  We tried to order the prosciutto, but apparently the restaurant was all out.  We were extremely upset, since the whole point of going to Perbacco was to get prosciutto.  Happily, the manager managed to find us some prosciutto (despite their earlier protestations) and we were able to eat our fill.  We also shared the salumi plate and a bottle of wine.  We were looking for a particular type of wine - medium and full bodied, tannins, not too fruity and the sommalier let us taste a number of different bottles before we settled on one.  Service was realy top notch, IMO.  It probably helped that we were four cute young gals.\n\nWell, that's it, I LOVE Perbacco.

In this case, I bashfully explained to our server my particular restrictions and was pleasantly surprised at how immediately accommodating he was. To me, that set the tone for the meal and I knew I'd be able to fully enjoy my choices without feeling the need to settle. He pointed out menu selections that included wheat and even options I might want to avoid just in case. When our barrata and heirlume tomato appetizer came to the table topped with breadcrumbs he-apologetically-asked if I'd like my own small slice sans breadcrumbs. I, not wanting to be a hassle, declined but after insistence from my father and the waiter, gratefully obliged. Good move as I absolutely loved the fresh cheese and tomatoes, paired in perfect harmony. With my taste buds delightfully ignited I eagerly awaited the arrival of my main course. \n\nI consider myself a healthy eater, food-intolerance's aside, but every now and then I get a craving that I must satisfy. When my craving focuses on meat, or in this case, pork, nothing else will do and my mindset is to go big or don't bother. As this was my birthday and my pork craving on an all-time high, I found my perfect match in Perbacco's \"porchetta\" entree. All I can say is HOLY PORCHETTA.

It's nice to go with friends who enjoy sampling several dishes and ordering several half orders that can be shared.  \n\nI started with a Rosmarino cocktail ($9) of Grey Goose vodka with lemon, rosemary simple syrup and apple brandy - sweet but good, served with a sprig of rosemary.  Consult with their Italian sommelier who knows his stuff and can assist you in selecting a wine to pair with your meal.  \n\nWe started out with a half order of the Salumni Misti ($18) which featured a variety of cured meats including mortadella and fennel salame.  We also sampled half orders of the Butternut Squash Mezzelune ($9) - delicious with sage browned butter and Castelmagno cheese - and the Tajarin ($10) handcut tagliatelle pasta with pork sugo and porcini mushrooms - very succulent and smooth with a orange zest addition which worked very well with this dish. \n\nEntrees for the most part are in the $20-29 range.   My party selected the Beef Short Ribs ($21) with celery root puree, and the Pork Shoulder ($19) with savoy cabbage and polenta.  I had the Pork with was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it.  The flavor was good and the cabbage paired well with the meat.  Sadly, the polenta had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  Considering the soupy texture and bland taste - this side was very disappointing.  \n\nThe chocolate tart ($8) and the trio of gelato ($7) - hazelnut, bitter-sweet chocolate, and pistachio were the perfect ending to a delightful meal.  \n\nA few added notes -  portion sizes were a bit small so be aware.  Service could have been faster, but due mainly to the kitchen and not the servers themselves who were quite attentive.  \n\nThe acoustics of the warm and inviting interior when filled with people can make it challenging to hear your own conversation.

These were served chilled and had a pronounced and distinctly sardine flavor: you love it or you do not, there is little in between. I found the egg yolks played nicely off the oily fish-ness of the sardines, and the salsa verde gave things a nice herbal flavor.\n\n\n\nNext was the roasted red and gold beets with arugula, Castelmagno cheese, and white balsamic vinaigrette ($10.00). This was a simple but successful salad, melding two different varieties of meaty and slightly fruity beets with the peppery bite of arugula and the earthy flavor of a good strong cheese.

The meaty and decadent broth was spiced lightly with saffron and had a piquant flash of tomato: it reminded me rather of a highly refined cioppino. The seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked, bypassing seafood stew's common issues with overcooked and rubbery shellfish. It's a light dish, almost too elegant: I would have liked a bit more of that delicious broth.\n\n\n\nThe sleeper hit of the evening were the side of brown butter brussels sprouts with capers and parmigiano reggiano ($5.00). These charmers flavored the falling-apart tender sprouts with a powerful hit of capers, rich brown butter, and distinctly stinky parmigiano. The overall flavor was that of a decadently rich and interesting casserole, and these were pretty impossible to risk - although the actual flavor of the sprouts was a secondary player here.\n\nFor the dessert course, we tried the pistachio panna cotta ($8.00), a straight forward and satisfyingly firm pudding with a nutty, slightly perfumed pistachio flavor. This was not a fancy dish, but it was a good ending to a rich meal.\n\n\n\nWe finished with a cheese plate, picking from Perbacco's nice selection of artisan cheeses. We settled on Bianco Sotto Bosco, a cow and goat milk cheese infused with truffles, and Caprino Di Riofrano, goat's milk cheese wrapped in chestnut leaf. ($12.00 for selection of two). I am no cheese critic, but both cheeses were earthy and tasty (and it is very hard to make truffled cheese bad.)\n\nPerbacco's dining room is very sleek and contemporary, and those expecting some sort of homey regional Italian experience will be disappointed. The place has the appearance of a restaurant tailor-made for power lunches and important networking dinners: in other words, don't come expecting a romantic environment or overwrought opera music on the sound system. The beautiful people are served by what seemed to be an engaging and well trained waitstaff: our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and our food came out with impressive speed and timing.\n\nWe will certainly return to Perbacco soon.

I mean, the former is one of the premier restaurants in the City, and the other one ... umm ... has been in business since 1849.   It's an interesting location choice, especially given that the decor suggests more of a SoMa location.  Exposed brick, stainless steel, and art deco inspired logo reminded me of my dot com days.\n\nIt's not your grandma's Italian restaurant.  Instead of focaccia bread and olive oil, you have gourmet breadsticks and pesto dip; instead of generic plates and silverware, you have elegant table settings; instead of spaghetti with meatballs, you have something more gourmet; instead of uncle Mario who is also the host and a short order cook, you have a knowledgeable, pleasant waiter.\n\nI started with a gold and red beets salad with greens and vinaigrette dressing.  Beets are beets, but I liked the presentation.  I only ordered beets because my dinner companion ordered the arugula salad that I really wanted.  Don't blame me for wanting to be original.\n\nThen my entree came.  I opted for the risotto with veal.  The risotto was delicious, and veal was very tender.  Granted, my plate only had two tiny medallions of veal, carefully and delicately placed in the middle of the plate, but they were really, really good.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the pear and almond tart served with Creme Anglaise.  The tart was very rich, and the almond paste was fantastic.  Creme Anglaise was a bit too tart for my taste (no pun intended).  It tasted a bit like sour cream and custard mixed together and left in the sun for a couple of days.  Not my favorite item.  My dinner companion, however, opted for a chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream, which was clearly a better choice.  \n\nOh, and don't forget to order the espresso.  The tiny cup alone is worth the money.  You can feel very European drinking the espresso, or you can feel like a giant just holding a tiny cup.\n\nOverall, Perbacco is a welcome addition to the San Francisco landscape.

I have been a waiter and I know the game, but if your going to pick the priciest thing as your \"favorite\"  (I should have said favorite thing to eat, not sell) you should know how to describe it in an appealing way.\n\nAs far as the food goes, the first two courses were great (hamachi crudo and blood orange salad first, then truffle gnocchi in mushroom brodo) but the main courses were far short of expectations.  The duck was a huge portion but chewy and the rabbit was very dry.  \n\nIf you go, I suggest sticking with the pasta dishes which are quite good and available in app or entree sizes.

Our second Pasta Dish was the Pappardelle in a Braised Short Rib Ragu and we thought that was delicious as well.\n\nFor our Mains, we had the King Salmon with Roasted Padrone Peppers, Artichoke Passato & Melted Cherry Tomatoes.  Sounds pretty fancy, huh?  Our other Entree was the Grilled Lamb Sirloin Tagliata with a Summer Bean Salad & MInt Salsa Verde.  Both were good, but I think the Pastas were more of the Star.\n\nFor Dessert:\nThey brought us a Warm Pistachio Cake with a Cherry Compote and Vanilla-Thyme Syrup, which was Divine.

We also had the Gelati Misti, which was a Trio of the following Flavors - Chocolate/Vanilla & Caramel with Sea Salt and a Vanilla Strawberry Twirl.

It's what their known for so don't sleep on 'em.\n-Service was Exceptional. \n\nAdditional Info from My Prior Experiences:\n-I tried their Burrata, which I thought did not touch the Burrata at A16.\n-Had the Salumi Misti which was the Chef's Selection, which I highly recommend.

I decided I had to see for myself. The first place I stopped on my exploration of Manhattans in San Francisco was Pebacco. Pebacco is in the middle of the Financial District, with a rather small facade that belies the size of the restaurant inside. I of course situated myself at the bar and, after introducing myself to the bartender, mentioned that I heard they do a great Manhattan. With pride he replied, \"We absolutely do\", and he put one together for me. The Manhattan was very good; it was well assembled, but it didn't have quite the level of bite I was looking for. The best way to describe their Manhattan is it's one with training wheels; if you're new to classic cocktails and are just looking for somewhere to start, this would be the Manhattan for you. It was mellow, approachable, but still tasty.\n\nFor dinner I decided to start off with the pesce crudo. Frankly, I had no idea what it would be, but the ingredients included hamachi, basil, ginger and a little jalape\u00f1o, which all sounded good and I took a chance and went for it. I'm glad I did. The flavors all came together perfectly, and the jalape\u00f1os were sliced thin enough that they brought just a little heat to the party but didn't overwhelm the dish. I went with the scallops for my main, which was served with corn and pearl onions. Scallops, like shrimp, are very simple to do well, but also very easy to overcook. I'd say that a good 80% of the time when I order either one in a restaurant it's rubbery and overcooked. These, however, were cooked to perfection. The wine the bartender recommended (a sauvignon blanc) matched nicely.

I went two weeks ago with my girlfriend, and without fail the food was delicious. \n\nI started with truffle and ricotta gnocchi, mixed with wild mushrooms; the pasta was cooked wonderfully, and the flavors were very well balanced, with a distinct truffle note but not allowing either fungus to overpower the dish. She started with fritto misto rock shrimp, served with a lemon aioli; the shrimp was cooked very well, but to me the real standout here were the other bits in the dish. Green beans and a squash or cucumber were present, but the real surprise and delight was the occasional olive, prepared fritto misto as well. \n\nOur main courses continued this theme of excellence. Her pesto was some of the best I have ever tasted, striking a perfect balance between the powerful ingredients. I ordered the quail, which was presented steaming hot from its original dish onto my plate. The bird was stuffed with a sausage, which helped to balance with the gamy flesh, with beet greens and \"polenta rustica\", a coarse-grained polenta, on the side. Each of these was incredible, but the real finishing touch was black truffle grated over the polenta. That this was not advertised as part of the dish impressed me all the more. \n\nBetween our dinners and the free bread and bread sticks, my date and I almost had to skip dessert, but we managed to eat our way through a raspberry sorbetto and strawberry gelato; that each of these tasted as if we were eating the chilled berries helped us in our endeavor. \n\nService at Perbacco was also a head above the rest; we arrived early, and were seated prior to our actual reservation.

The salumi plates are plated at one end of the bar and they have a kick ass chef's dream Italian meat slicer at the end of the bar - I was pleased as I took this as a sign of the restaurants seriousness about their food.

He was darling and made us two very delicious drinks. . . as we waited for our table (we were early for our reservation) I perused the menu.  It all looked amazing!  It's one of those menus that makes you wish you had more than one stomach. . .sort of a reserve, if you will, for those times where you just don't want to be limited to one.  Like a ruminate but better.

I do truly appreciate some elbow room!\n\nWe ordered the ciccioli from the salumi menu which is a pork pate of sorts very similar to rilletes.  It was delicious - it came with some crostini and a small dollop of orange marmalade to offset the richness.  \n\nNext came the burrata.  A very generous mound of unctuous cheese drizzled with black truffle oil.  Served with perfectly toasted filone.  My only disappointment here was I would have like more bread with this dish.\n\nNext came carne cruda - a steak tartare of sorts made with veal instead of beef (same but different) - very delicious with just the right amount of garlic to accent the veal without overwhelming it.  We also got the fritto misto which was good as well with the usual suspects (rock shrimp, green beans, fennel) and a surprise of olives. . I'd never had a deep fried olive before and really enjoyed it.  \n\nNext came three appetizer portions of pasta - a pappardelle with braised shortrib sauce and porcini, penne with meatballs and tajarin; which is a thin, square cut pasta similar to angel hair with a five hour pork sugo.  Of the three, the best was the pappardelle - really deep flavor - almost buttery from the braise.  The tajarin was very good, too.  The pasta was obviously fresh and perfectly cooked and the sauce was quite delicious.   One complaint would be that it was that none of the pastas were hot enough - I think it would have been helpful to heat the plates and serve the pasta in small, shallow bowls as opposed to flat plates.   Also, the meatballs were a little tough - flavorful but tough. \n\nNext (no, I am not kidding!), came the pork shoulder, short ribs and a piece of cotechino  - cotechino is one of my favorite Italian sausages and they were featuring it in a bollito misto - I didn't want all the elements of a bollito misto so I asked for just a piece of the cotechino and they very graciously complied and even served it with the three sauces that would have gone with the bollito misto - an orange marmalade, a finely pureed salsa verde and a piquant tomato relish.  The pork shoulder was one of my best dishes I've ever had.  I love braised meat and this dish was just so perfect, I wanted to eat only that.  But then the short rib was not too shabby either. . it's kind of like if you had Jeffrey Dean Morgan standing next to George Clooney and you had to pick between them.  Both luscious!  The cotechino was stellar as well - perfect texture and very balanced spices.  I was so happy with the entrees!  These days, it seems that restaurants present amazing appetizers and then fall short on the entrees but Perbacco dishes up some amazing entrees.\n\nWe were full so we didn't get to have dessert - next time less entrees, more dessert.  \n\nThis restaurant is only 7 weeks old so there were some service bumps - kind of slow on service and lag time between pastas and entrees was a little long.

The antipasto plates coming out were making our mouths water, so our cool waitress recommended the chefs selection, which is basically whatever he feels like giving us. When the selection came out, we were told that they cure all the meats there and were told more about the specific region of Italy that the food originates from...I live for this stuff. To me, that whole engagement with your server makes the experience really special and our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable and charming. My favorite standout for me was the pate' served with a kind of apricot compote-- the savory and the sweet together just pops on your tastebuds. \nI can only speak for the appetizers, drinks and the waitress- but I'll be back for entrees the next time around- but this time, intentionally.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-04-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Opened by famed former Scala's chef, Steffan Terje, PerBacco specializes in Northern Tuscan food.\n\n"], "author": "Papandreou A.", "review": "Opened by famed former Scala's chef, Steffan Terje, PerBacco specializes in Northern Tuscan food.\n\nThey have done a wonderful job with the space.

This was a wonderful selection of the finest salami I have ever tasted.  The Nostrano was tender and sweet dotted with peppercorns, the finocchiona (cinta senese) was rich and seasoned with fennel- accompanied with the spicy version for contrast.  The sanguinato \"blood sausage\" was suprisingly delicious- a tarty sweetness but not too rich.\nThe Fritto Misto- was crispy and light- the rock shrimp was fresh with the  addition of  green beans, olives, fennel and lemon rings -all suited the aioli lemon dipping sauce.\nMy friend ordered the Beef Short Rib Stracotto- an italian version of pot roast- deliciously flavored with carrots, peas and gremolata.\nThe Braised Lamb Shank was the best I've had in a while, it was stewed to perfection- meat almost falling off the bones- the reduced stew sauce was impeccably rich and bold- I highly recommend it!\nNone of this could not have been more accentuated  by the Avignonesi 50 & 50 Capannelle, 2000 Tuscan wine- rich tannins- fresh tartiness that when allowed to breathe revealed its layers of complexity.  From appetizers- they were lush plums, cherries, and chocolate.  By the main dish- they were ripening raisins, prunes and light tabacco...ahhhh wines do breathe :-) \nI really liked the modern feel to this place, the dusk lighting and Cezanne-esque Italian countryside paintings were nostalgically entertaining, the staff all uniformed in crisp white shirts- not only conveyed tidiness but knowledge and courteousness.\n\nPS- Making Perbacco your next lunch/dinner venue will certainly accentuate a positive outlook in your life!

Drinks at the bar were crisp; I had a greyhound for an extra dose of vitamin c during cold season. At the bar, you get to watch the crudo and salumi stations prepare their platters. \n\nWe were seated downstairs in the low ceilinged nook that housed the kitchen at the Gold Coast. They've done a lot with the space, conversations were held at normal levels despite the crowd. As our entire table wanted to try as many items as possible, we opted for the small ($18) salumi misto. Our waitress pushed us to order the large ($30) but we were also ordering a crudo, 2 salads, and entrees, which sounded like a lot of food. The small platter ended up being more than sufficient with about 3 pieces each of prosciutto, mortadella, a few salumi, and a pork pate. Although I'm a sucker for cured meats and will go to extreme lengths for crocks of pate, nothing on the plate was craveworthy. Everything was good, but it lacked sparkle. \n\nService issues became apparent as the crudo, radicchio salad, and pear, gorgonzola, and endive salad arrived. Our food runner would silently drop plates onto the crowded table with a complete lack of finesse. We were left holding plates and moving glasses out of the way as we waited for our waitress to return for the used items. It was definitely awkward, and there was no coordination between the bussers, food runners, waitress, etc. \n\nThe crudo was very fresh and the portion was quite large especially compared to the tiny portion at the Slanted Door. The kitchen nicely split the basic radicchio salad with creamy garlic dressing. During the chaos of the starters our wine, a Piedmontese Roero Arneis, arrived. Interestingly, they pour the wine for you and whisk it away to a table at the center of the room. While this is usually fine with me, there was confusion throughout the night if our bottle had been finished or was merely hiding. A major complaint of mine was the wine service. For a 4-top eating a multi-course meal, they completely dropped the ball on our booze. We had friends from out of town visiting and it was impossible to get a second bottle despite trying to flag down our waitress, asking our food runner, and asking some other guy for it. I was shocked at how difficult it was to order the second bottle. By the time our waitress returned, half of our entrees had been eaten and some of our guests thought it was too late for another bottle. The manfriend and I ordered another 1/2 liter, but this aspect of the meal really bothered me. I like my beverages! \n\nAfter another round of musical plates when the entrees arrived, I was finally able to tuck into the lauded agnolotti dal plin, little pockets filled with a mlange of veal, sausage, and vegetables. It seems everywhere I turn these days, this newly chic pasta shape is receiving heaps of praise from food mags, bloggers, and critics.I liked it, but it did not illicit the same toe-curling need to lick my plate as the chicken and foie gras ravioli at Delfina or even the need to order another serving immediately afterward like the crab and toasty breadcrumb pasta at A16. The filling was balanced and savory, and I enjoyed the sheer wisps of savoy cabbage in the pool of browned roasted meat juices that coated the pasta. However, I expected thinner wrappers to ensure a maximum filling to noodle ratio.\n\nI anticipated more from the Berkshire pork shoulder al latte. I cook a lot of pork roasts, carnitas, and other succulent cuts at home. I turned to the manfriend for his reaction, it was \"yeah, it's okay.\" Some bites were on the dry side which is really odd for such a fatty cut that had been braised. He later reported that some bites were quite good, but it's pork shoulder, come on! The rest of the table was happy with their gorgonzola and nettle gnocchi and tuna mains. \n\nNo space for dessert after all that. We asked the waitress to put $100 on the card and gave her $140 cash; equaling the total plus exactly 20% for tip despite the service issues. I did not take up any of the issues with the manager and give them a chance to correct them. It was so hard to get a 2nd bottle of wine and I had guests with me, so I thought it would be a big scene. When entertaining, you want things to go as smoothly as possible. Instead, what we got back was the full bill ($200) on the card and $140 cash had been taken for a tip. A 70% tip! WTF? No way, not after the wine debacle. We eventually got the bill corrected but she acted like it was someone else's fault. I'm not sure who would make that sort of mistake, as a 70% tip is unusual.

The feel at Perbacco is on the serious side given its location in the financial district.  Think Aqua, One Market, Boulevard, but just a tad more causal.  The place is general bustling with the typical downtown business crowd.  They have a nice bar, where you can grab a drink and apps before sitting down for dinner.  The dinning room is a little bland, and can get a little bit noisy.  Its fun though and would work perfect for a meal with a friend/friends or business acquaintances.\n\nService: 3.5 stars.  I found our service to be better than adequate.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating.  The timing of the food was perfect and I really have nothing to complain about here.  However, one thing to remember, is that there is little intimacy and the service is more on the serious side given the clientele.  Don't take this the wrong way, they are not rude in any way.   Additionally, when we were there (Thurs night) it was very busy, so our waitress only made a couple of stops by the table.  Overall though, I was totally satisfied with the service, but it wasn't anything to rave about.\n\nFood: 4 stars.  I have heard some very mixed things from friends on Perbacco, but I have to say everything we ordered was very good.  We started with a Salame plate that had four different preparations.  There was a blood salame, a fennel salame, and two others that I forget.  I liked all four and I thought the portion side was more than generous.  Next we moved into some apps: the steak tartar and the bresaola.  The tartar left something to be desired.  It was good, but not really all that special, and I have had much better tartar, so I would look to the bresaola if you want a meat as an app.  For those of you that have never tried Bresaola give it a whirl, it is basically air dried salted steak.  Yum.  It was thin as paper, but had amazing freshness and very concentrated meat flavors.  For entrees we ordered the Pappardelle with braised short rib ragu and the duck breast.  The pasta was delicious, made fresh and cooked perfectly.  The short rib ragu was a very nice touch adding a nice richness to the pasta without making it over the top.  The duck was also good, and I think some of best duck I have had in the city recently.  It was a breast, but came whole rather than the thinly sliced preparation you normally receive.  I felt this locked in the flavors better and created more rich earthy flavors that speak more to the heart of the food.  Very tasty and highly recommended.  Finally for desert we had a trio of gelatos.  All were really good, there was a chocolate flavor, a hazelnut and a pistachio.  Nothing special, but all really good, and a nice refreshing end to the meal.\n\nWine: 4 stars.  Perbacco has a really solid list, specializing in Italian varietals.  Most of the regions (not just the popular ones) are represented in both whites and reds.  This is great for experimenting with some of the rarer Italian wines.  We ordered a bottle of the Paolo Scavino Barbera d Alba.  For $42 you can't go wrong.  This is one of the best producers in Piedmont, and for those that don't want to drop $150 on one of his Barolos this is a fantastic option.  Next we dipped into a 1997 Tignanello (which I brought).  The Som waived our corkage since I bought a bottle, which I thought was pretty cool.  As far as the wine goes, though, I would first choose what you want to eat and then ask them to suggest some wine options.  Ask for something out of the ordinary, there are some really fun things on the list.  Bravo!\n\nOverall: 4 stars.  I was impressed all around with Perbacco.

"], "author": "Alex W.", "review": "3.5 stars\n\nPerbacco and I have a complex relationship. On one hand, it's ingredients are fresh and local and taste awesome. Some of the individual dishes I've had there are best in category (see short ribs below). Yet, I've felt at times like I'm intaking food from a rail gun (see salumi plate below), or there's just an item that's off...\n\nBread and butter:\n- Bread: for a high-caliber Italian place, your bread is passable, but it's nothing to write home about. It's not very chewy and tastes a bit dry. I think the density is the main issue--there's to much air and too many air pockets that make the bread not enjoyable on its own. However, it does soak in sauces well, and most of your meat and pasta dishes have sauces that are simply divine. This bread + shortrib sauce + my mouth = happiness. \n\n- Butter: high-five for room temperature butter, but needs salt. \n\nAppetizers:\n\n- SALUMI MISTI - I ordered a small, and this could feed 4 people. It was pleasant and a nice snack with bread, but nothing stood out as being terribly distinctive. One of the salumi items tasted like raw, ground meat, which was slightly off-putting. I don't know if the issue is even with the plate--Italian cured meats are categorically inferior to Spanish Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. (As a plug, the BEST cured meat I've ever had is the 5-yr old ham from Brindisa in Borough Market, London; pretty good manchego and membrillo too)\n\n- Goose salad (ordered to-go) - 5-slices of goose breast over some arugula for $22? Are you kidding me? Say hello to my little friend, the log of dining disappointments\n\nMains:\n\n- PAPPARDELLE (WIDE PASTA RIBBONS / SLOW COOKED SHORT RIB RAGU / ROASTED CIPOLLINE / GRATED HORSERADISH) - wow, this was a solid pasta dish with really fresh homemade pasta and awesome short ribs on the inside. The technique was flawless and the texture was al-dente chewy and gorgeously umami-rich and buttery. Would suggest putting a touch more salt in the sauce. Only note on presentation is that it was a little messy and felt more like a home-cooked meal (which I'll take any day over wow-factor presentation at the expense of flavor)\n\n- BEEF SHORT RIB STRACOTTO (ROOT VEGETABLE PASSATINA / CAVOLO NERO / HONEY GLAZED CIPOLLINE AND CARROTS) - this baby came out and my jaw dropped. I was literally mid-conversation with the guy next to me at the bar, and I just stopped talking while my mouth went into epileptic shock. The smell envelops your head in a cloud of charred meat, tobacco and browned butter flavors. I talked to the bartender and he mentioned that the meat cooks for a 3 hours at 120 degrees, making the entire piece of Niman Ranch boneless short rib fall apart as soon as you touch it. Fat and meat juices were so well distributed throughout the short rib that I hesitated every time I touche it with a fork. I just wanted to admire this (large) piece of short rib perfection. The purple, white and orange carrots and other baby winter root vegetables elevated the plating to a stratospheric level. I'm not kidding when I say this is perfect plate of food. I could have this once a week for the rest of my life, and I would be a happy camper. I cannot emphasize enough how good this particular dish is--of all the deliciously memorable dishes I've had in my lifetime, this easily ranks in the top 10. \n\nDesserts:\n\n- MEYER LEMON PANNA COTTA (HUCKLEBERRY COMPOTE / ROSEMARY SHORTBREAD) - technically perfect preparation of panna cotta, though I wasn't 100% set on the compote. The compote's texture was a bit too stiff for this dish and tended to stick to my fork as I ate the panna cotta. \n\nIn short: check this place out. It's a fun place to go with friends, prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service. The selection of Italian wines is off the charts and the short rib dish is the best preparation of short rib I've ever had in my life.

But because it's so noisy, and huge, it feels a tad impersonal, not warm and cozy.  Ehh, that's a nit that doesn't need picking\n\nHere's what 3 of us ate last night:  Brandacujun --- salt cod/potato gratin/crostini - perfect balance of warm potato with crunchy browned top and salty cod; mozzarella di bufala/black truffle condimento/arugula/grilled pilone (a type of bread) - SOOOO GOOD.  So creamy soft, like melting jack cheese, but not warm, with the truffle and arugula, on the nicely charred bread - very heady; Coppa di testa - warm pig's head terrine!!  like rillettes, chopped up and then spread very thin into two disks, had a sweet, almost clove-y, cinnamon-y taste; this was a wow, and even tho my friend was put off by the fact it was pig's head, he loved it; carne cruda of vitallone/black truffle condimento/crostini - raw cute little baby veal (i have to get over this, i ate veal all over Italy - you almost can't get grown-up cow there!) of course was yummy, almost like the texture of ahi tuna tartare; fritto misto of rock shrimp/green beans/olives/meyer lemon/fennel/lemon aioli - very nice, light batter, olives were a nice tart touch in a rich dish like this; pappardelle/braised short rib ragu/roasted chanterelles - another rich dish - slow cooked, meaty, dark sauce, mixed in with big flat homemade noodles; fijian (!) swordfish/fingerling potatoes/chanterelles - better than the pappardelle even - tender and dense and flavorful.  dessert was a sort of chocolate tart with carmelized hazelnuts and some kind of polenta cake/vanilla ice cream/fruit coulis/with more carmelized hazelnuts - have to say dessert was a disappointment to me, but i'm not a huge dessert person.  my two companions liked it.  i thought the polenta cake was heavy (tho the waiter described it as light) and flavorless, and the chocolate thing was a bit dry, and hazelnuts are my least favorite nut.\n\nBut i have to say, overall, YUM.

I ordered the beef short ribs based on the server's rave reviews and received about 10 ounces of beef fat with 2 ounces of gritty meat.

That meant that those of us in the center on that side were completely trapped there.  I don't know if there was a heater under the seat or what, but everyone on that side was sweating when we left.  It was so damn hot (and I only had a sip of wine!)  We had 8 different bottles of wine on our table - 4 white and 4 red.  I was really impressed by the service in this respect.  The waiters poured the wine throughout the evening and gave us as many different glasses for it as we wanted.  The service overall was much better at dinner than it was at lunch.  I was very disappointed to find rolls as the dinner bread.  I really wanted that focaccia again!  For dinner I had the spring garlic gnocchi with asparagus sauce.  It was really, really yummy.  I would definitely order that dish again.  I had some dessert this time too - lemon panna cotta - super delicious!\n\nWhile I think they have some atmospheric problems in here, the food is just fabulous.  I will definitely return again soon.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Perbacco holds to European service standards:  "], "author": "Dennis H.", "review": "UPDATE - 3/25/08:\n\nI had lunch here with a friend today and we couldn't have enjoyed ourselves -- and the food -- more.

The wood paneling is cut poorly, the edges don't meet, the stainless steel corner gaurds don't come up to the top, and then they just secured it all with huge bolts right through the finish wood. it looks like a job someone's drunk uncle would do in cheap basement redesign. and it is directly at eye level! soooo shoddy! i realize it's not about the food, but it's like the age-old clean bathroom theory... if a place can't get those small details right, what's going on in the kitchen?\n\nmy cocktail was terrible (frisson ruined me)... way too sweet with no flavor but vodka and sugar with a sugar rim. and some sugar. oh, and did i mention it had sugar? first thing they tell us is that there's no more burrata which is the one thing i really wanted. watercress salad was fine. watercress and ricotta salata with o+v. maybe .50cents worth of product on the plate for $9.00. what is that, like a 450% mark up? \n\nthen we tried to order wine but i am not knowledgeable about italian wines and these are far and away the bulk of what they have. the sommelier came over, but he had such a thick accent i really could not follow what he was saying. granted that was my problem, so i just got a glass of cab (and the waitress did nicely swap it for my unpalatable cocktail.) but it would really help to have the wine menu broken up into some categories like \"big reds\", \"dry whites\", etc.\n\nfor dinner i had risotto which was also just fine. nothing exciting or out of the ordinary in any way, shape or form. the risotto i had a few months back at chez spencer... that was extraordinary! my bf ordered rabbit or something (probably the real reason i was pissed at him - how can  you sit down and order thumper's cousin with your vegetarian girlfriend?) anyway, she brought one dish and after he took a couple bites she comes back and said she ordered him the wrong thing. she takes the plate and leaves him with nothing while we wait for his main dish. i've worked in a lot of restaurants, and usually it's polite if it's your fuck up to just let the customer enjoy what you brought them while their correct dish is cooked. it's not like someone else was going to be able to eat it after my boyfriend already started it. and of course i was finished by the time his came. and no, we did not even get a free scoop of gelato for that.\n\nwe did order 2 desserts - i always like to give a place a chance up until the very end. the panna cotta was not very good - it was not nearly as rich or nicely tectured as many in the city ( it is as chic as molten chocolate cake at this point), though it did have a good cookie with it. the coffee custard w/ chocolate crust was quite good, but the best part of the meal was certainly the sambucca. too bad perbacco didn't have anything to do with that, or they might have gotten another star.", "rating": 2, "date": "2007-06-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Went to Perbacco on a recommendation.

No way.\nFirst off, the space sucks. Its noisy, crowded adn gives one the feel of a conference center and the smell of rank carpet. They sat us on the second floor under an exit sign. Since my wife refused to glow green all night we were given another table 10 feet away. Not much of an improvement.\nSecondly, the service was abyssmal. I lost count of the times my mind drifte to 'where the hell is our waiter' and I had to flag someone down more than thrice to get some attention.

I was taking several co-workers out to dinner so I was a little nervous about trying a new place, but am I glad we went!  \nThe food was fantastic.  We had way to many dishes to list them all. There were six of us so we split a few different appetizers, which were all delicious.  Almost all of us had a different entree, but everyone loved what they ordered.  And dessert!  Again, we all split a few desserts and I highly HIGHLY recommend the chocolate tart.  It's amazing.  That was our favorite dessert.  \nThe staff was very nice.  We never waited too long for anything, nor did we feel rushed.  The tables weren't too close together.  I can't stand it when it feels like you are eating dinner with the strangers next to you.  I didn't ever feel like any one conversation was overpowering and I'm pretty sure our group was OK.  The mezzanine was a cool place to be seated.  We didn't have a drink at the bar, but it looked fun and the place was pretty crowded when we left (it was a Thursday  night).\nThe only negative, and it's not really that bad, is that the menu is a bit pretentious, even for San Francisco.  There are a lot of fancy food words and you sort of find yourself looking for things you recognize (e.g. does that mean it's a chicken dish??)
