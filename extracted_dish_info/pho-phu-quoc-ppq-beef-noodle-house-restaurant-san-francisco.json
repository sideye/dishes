I indicated I had spoken with a man over the phone who according to the lady at the register had never received my order.  They offered to take the order right then and there while again not offering any sort of concession for the miscommunication.

There were 4 of us last time & we all ordered our own dish but today decided to order family style. What a mistake. The five spice chicken was the only dish that came out ok. They served the grilled beef & grilled pork on a cast iron platter which cause the meat to be way overcooked. It costed much more and didn't seem like it was worth it. I thought I'd give the oxtails a try since we love ox tails. If you've never ordered it, don't! There were 2 pieces of decent sized oxtails, 3 pieces that were smaller than my pinkie and these white floating things that we thought were potatoes! Imagine how disgusted we were when we bit into a mouth full of FAT. It had no taste and was so greasy. I'm so disappointed & disgusted.\n\nBy the time I got home, I was literally sick to my stomach.

Props to Ringo M. newly Elite yelper for the Fergie reference calling it PHOgalicious. I see you. \n\nLet's start off on a good note and to the point (PHO jokes aside) with what you should order because I wouldn't come here if I didn't have to.\n\nGo for the curry chicken noodle.  If you are anything like me and love some fresh aroma and flavor added ask for extra onions and cilantro to brighten up that light tasty curry. The curry isn't strong and pungent like that of an Indian style of curry and not super sweet like that of a Thai curry.  It's more in the middle on both ends of smell and taste.  The pleasant and subtle sweetness of the curry soup is thanks to the coconut milk they put in there.   There's a much better spot for this on Noriega but over here this is on the top of my list.\n\nThe five spice chicken is alright here. They always use a marinated dark meat so it always comes out juicy and tender.\n\nYou can't go wrong with the appetizers like the fresh spring rolls and egg rolls.  Any restaurant that can manage to screw this one up is a failure.\n\nThe 3 stars for this review is because I personally don't like their pho broth as much as other pho spots. Beef soup of the pho is the star of the show here and yet it falls short.  I ordered the Pho Dac Biet aka Combination Beef Noodle Soup.  A little more on the bland side with not much going on.  What I mean is that you can taste a soup that has been cooking for hours on end creating depth of flavor in the soup base from its ingredients. Then there are some that just seem like it has been cooking for the minimal amount of time needed to get it boiling lacking depth, and rather monotonous to the taste.  Keep in mind that although I speak in terms of depth, most restaurants would load up the MSG so it's hard to say what they do here.  I love a good soup without the MSG if possible. Nonetheless there's gotta be a great base before all else. Some of my friends like their soup so I'm sure it is a preference thing.  For me I want some love in my soup.  Whoever it is behind that range stove should be making love to my soup for hours before it even gets to me.  No love here.\n\nBring floss if you are going for the ox tail.  A nice tender ox tail needs to be  braised properly also with a little bit of love.  No love here either.  The ox tail is rather tough, fibrous, and surely lacking flavor.  If you happen to try it out anyway and didn't bring floss, you're in luck... they have plenty of toothpicks. Take full advantage of those.\n\n2 stars for their service.  A little slow side most often times.  We could be sitting there for awhile and still no one comes to take our order just like last week.  There's also this one girl that always has this funny attitude.  It's hard to ask her anything because she expects us to know every detail on the menu as a customer.  She's been there working there forever so I had a few instances of that.\n\nI'd very much rather head 6 blocks down to Yummy Yummy for better service, variety, and depth of flavors or to Quan Ngon on Irving for better soup bases.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-08-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The first instance was where I ordered the Ox Tail \"with\" potatoes and carrots in a savory sauce.

I indicated I had spoken with a man over the phone who according to the lady at the register had never received my order.
