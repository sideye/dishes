The Bay Area being, in my opinion, San Diego and Orange County's toughest rival on the west coast as far as dining is concerned, I do so with great relish, and Yelp is my guide.  Rolling out bed early on a Saturday morning, hoping to find someplace close by that was original and masterful, the Yelp app guided me from my bedchamber to this place just off of the Cable Car line.\n\nPat's is a hole-in-the-wall, its bright, colorful marquee rendering an otherwise hidden sliver of a restaurant more visible.  At 8:00 AM on a Saturday, the restaurant sat mostly empty, with a few back tables occupied by local couples.  Shortly after I was seated, however, people began filtering in, and within fifteen minutes the room was filled and there was a line.  Though at first apprehensive about my choice, I decided that San Franciscans sleep in, and that the crowd would validate the wisdom of my fellow Yelper's opinions.\n\nAfter taking in the assorted artwork (all for sale) depicting variously ironic interpretations of the Golden Gate coast and its landmark suspension bridge, the time came to look over the menu.  The variety is sufficiently wide so as to appeal to anyone: eggs any style, assorted specialty benedicts including California style (replacing ham with an heirloom tomato and adding avocado), and all manner of delicious (and deliciously sinful sounding) griddle classics... peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes?  That sounds perfect.\n\nIn fact, it's exactly what I went for, along with an apple chicken sausage and a poached egg.  I'll say it now:  the pancake is dessert and ONLY dessert.  I shiver to consider how much starch and sugar was in that thing, and how many days were shaved off my life with each bite, but lord it was worth it.  The pancake's texture was fluffy and subtly sweet, the chocolate melting like a striated braided stream throughout its heavenly interior.  The peanut butter, creamy and melted, added a rich nuttiness that perfectly complemented it, rendering syrup superfluous (as if that wasn't obvious.)  It was basically a peanut butter cookie in grander scale... and would keep my engine running all day long.  The chicken sausage was smokey and savory, and the egg, poached medium, just the perfect amount of loose yolk.  \n\nService throughout was attentive.

Yelp rarely has false negatives, but sometimes it does have false positives, and this was definitely one of those times.\n\nFirst, in a town with this many options, the menu was singularly uninteresting. Pat's serves ordinary, run-of-the-mill American diner breakfast food. There's no exotic one-of-a-kind vegan options or local fruit sources or house-made granola or coffee from a SF roaster--none of that. So if you're looking for the familiar, this is the place; if you want more of the local flavor, stay away. Apart from the bright paint on the outside, the panache of this place is decidedly average.\n\nThen there's the prices. Yes, Pat's is located on the edge of the touristy waterfront area. Yes, it's near several motels. But there are no deals to be found here. Take what you think mediocre American diner food should cost, double it, and you'll have Pat's pricing structure. If the food had tasted better, I would have been willing to pay even more--but it didn't, and I felt gouged for a very mediocre product.\n\nWhich brings me to the food... I paid $11 for the worst eggs benedict of my life. There was a single, thin strip of ham stretched across both halves of the english muffin, and the whole thing was simply drowned in melted butter. Yes, Hollandaise is supposed to contain butter, but melted butter was the only flavor, and it completely overwhelmed everything else. The cup of coffee was only OK and cost more than Starbucks.\n\nFinally, service was slow, despite having several staff present doing very little.\n\nIn summary, at Pat's you overpay to be underwhelmed.

We have given this breakfast place plenty of chances to be a great North Beach breakfast cafe that you do not have to wait two hours in line for, but it failed us once again. I am bummed, super bummed.\n\nI highly advice the owner to reevaluate what is going on. Highly over-priced art on the walls (there is a strange dinosaur picture in the bathroom obviously depicting how the owner views SF customers), slow service, dirty dish ware, cold food that has sat in the serving window or something for too long.

It was close enough that I figured I could make it there before I killed someone in my pre-caffeine morning grog-rage, so I decided to try it out.  \n\nThe decor was cute (despite some crap art on the wall), and they offered a couple of tables outdoors. The server was prompt in bringing us menus and coffee. Mmmm, my caffeine fix...*gag*! The coffee was vile! It tasted like someone had ashed in it. (Yes, as an ex-smoker who likes her drink, I know *exactly* what this tastes like.) Not a good way to start off a meal. It was so undrinkable I considered leaving, but feared for the lives of passersby, so conceded to eating something first. \n\nI was delighted when the plates arrived with a slice of decorative watermelon. The food did not deserve such grace, however. The crepe I had was too sweet for the contents; it tasted like a maple-syrup pancake, clashing with the cheddar, mushrooms, onions, and chicken sausage inside. Perhaps they were trying to capture the imagination of McGriddle fans. The veggies tasted like they'd been resting on the grill all morning: limp, with the flavor all burnt out. The home fries were ridiculously greasy and it was obvious they'd made a few rounds on the grill. In fact, they tasted like you were eating grill-scrapings moreso than potatoes. My companion's French toast combination featured two tiny slices of baguette with the eggs and sausage. It tasted fine, but nothing I couldn't concoct in my own kitchen in thirty seconds or less: there was no spice or additional flavor to contribute to the eggy taste. \n\nService was fine, but the meal was incredibly underwhelming. It's sad when the decorative watermelon slice was the best tasting part of your meal. Another note: they offer free WiFi, but that seems meaningless in the context of their shite coffee.

To add to the mess, that party essentially acted like they owned the joint and was clobbering every inch of free space up and out of their chairs. They were a detriment to the overall experience.\n\nOverall, the experience was good.

The only reason I gave it two stars is because my man likes it and because I think the location, ambience, and service are nice.\n\nAnyway, Tuesday afternoon at Pat's Cafe, I'm having lunch, eating a perfectly delicious meal of roasted vegetable sandwich (eggplant, portabella, zucchini) and garlic-cilantro-lime french fries. Everything is yummy. Nothing I ate raised a red flag. But a couple of hours later, I start to feel somewhat queasy. So I decide not to go for a swim and instead hit the bus a little earlier than usual.\n\nThe instant I get on the bus, I smell steak, which grosses me out further. A few stops later, someone saturated with the olfactory pleasures of cigars and men's cologne sits next to me. When he gets up twenty minutes later, someone else wearing way too much floral perfume takes the seat next to me. I'm more scent-sensitive than a three-months pregnant woman with morning sickness and hotter than a cat in heat. I get off the bus a stop early, thinking I'd rather barf on the sidewalk than inside the bus on myself and others.\n\nI don't puke, but when I get to my apartment, I open all the windows and flop onto the couch. I alternate between too hot and too cold before a friend stops by to say hi. I'm a horrible hostess; the place is a mess because I unwisely decided to put off cleaning it after I returned from Austin, and I can hardly move, talk, or listen. Once I get the dry heaves, I send him on his way.\n\nHeaven knows how long I lie sweating and shaking on the couch before my man (who serendipitously lives two blocks away) sends me a text. I think I respond along the lines of \"PLZ HALP,\" so he brings over some Walgreen's brand stomach-soothing pink liquid. I take some immediately and five minutes later, sweat through my clothes and quite literally lose my lunch as I had been dying to do since about 3 p.m. into the handy red bucket I keep around for such incidents. Every muscle in my body tries to aid me in eliminating the offending fibrous purply-pink stomach contents. I retch until I can retch no more, and then I experience the chills again. Once that's over, I start to think that maybe I'm in the clear. Cue three more cycles of Pepto-fever-vomit-freeze in the next hour and a half or so, and nothing is left in my stomach, so we call my health insurance's 24-hour nurse line. The nice lady asks me what happened and whether I suspect heart attack or stroke and quizzes me on my symptoms. She politely tells me to get to the emergency room or an \"urgent care\" facility. I babble at her about not knowing what an urgent care facility is, but she gives me a reference number to call back with anyway once I've decided on a course of treatment.\n\nAt this point, I honestly think it would be less hassle for everyone if I just die in my apartment than if I try to get to the emergency room, so I just get naked, curl into the fetal position, and sleep fitfully until the next morning.\n\nIt feels like the worst hangover ever. Also, my muscles hurt from clenching while throwing up, and my throat hurts from being the exit point. Naturally I don't go into the office; I sleep for about four more hours, wake up, and do some work from home. I eat a piece of toast and drink some orange juice and water, thinking I am on the upswing. An hour or two later, I crap my pants.\n\nAlthough I am able to shower and get last night's vomit out of my hair, my well-being steadily declines throughout the afternoon. My man is a doll and brings over jello, Gatorade, tea, and saltines. I keep thinking I'm going to have another accident because my intestines are rumbling all night.\n\nToday I have eaten jello, rice, and bean soup, all of which nauseated me and caused my stomach to make more weird noises, but at least I can get out of bed and go out of sight of a toilet.

Perhaps they were trying to capture the imagination of McGriddle fans. The veggies tasted like they'd been resting on the grill all morning: limp, with the flavor all burnt out. The home fries were ridiculously greasy and it was obvious they'd made a few rounds on the grill. In fact, they tasted like you were eating grill-scrapings moreso than potatoes.

Two pork sausages, one egg of your choice, and two \"sourdough bread\" french toasts. Sourdough french toast? It was alright, up until you bit into the crumb of it. The center of the sourdough wasn't dipped with the french toast batter and the end result: it was just like eating only the inner portion of some plain sourdough. The house-made maple syrup was delicious but this should have be called the French Toast Sourdough, not Special.\n\nA nice hidden little cafe in front of the Cable Car stop, with friendly service and moderate prices (a cup of coffee is $2.25. yikes!), but not the best breakfast I've had.

It was so undrinkable I considered leaving, but feared for the lives of passersby, so conceded to eating something first. \n\nI was delighted when the plates arrived with a slice of decorative watermelon. The food did not deserve such grace, however. The crepe I had was too sweet for the contents; it tasted like a maple-syrup pancake, clashing with the cheddar, mushrooms, onions, and chicken sausage inside. Perhaps they were trying to capture the imagination of McGriddle fans. The veggies tasted like they'd been resting on the grill all morning: limp, with the flavor all burnt out. The home fries were ridiculously greasy and it was obvious they'd made a few rounds on the grill. In fact, they tasted like you were eating grill-scrapings moreso than potatoes. My companion's French toast combination featured two tiny slices of baguette with the eggs and sausage. It tasted fine, but nothing I couldn't concoct in my own kitchen in thirty seconds or less: there was no spice or additional flavor to contribute to the eggy taste. \n\nService was fine, but the meal was incredibly underwhelming. It's sad when the decorative watermelon slice was the best tasting part of your meal. Another note: they offer free WiFi, but that seems meaningless in the context of their shite coffee.
