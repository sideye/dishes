Definitely worth the $9 for the meal. The ingredients were spread out very well which is always important for me in a burrito. They offer different types of beans, sauces, and topping which you can customize your food with. I personally enjoy spicy food and got the hottest sauce they had which I enjoyed.\n\nDRINK: I didn't order any drinks while at this establishment so I can't give an honest assessment in this category. From memory, I believe they had standard drinks that you might expect at a place in a mall food court.\n\nATMOSPHERE: A pretty standard small taqueria atmosphere for the San Francisco area. It's small and a little loud but you'll be in and out relatively quickly so the atmosphere (whether you like or dislike it) won't stick around you much.\n\nSTAFF: The staff were very quick and effective at putting together a good burrito. Since this wasn't a sit down restaurant I didn't expect any conversation besides telling them what I wanted on my burrito.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nIf this burrito was served anywhere other than San Francisco or San Diego it probably would have been a 4 star review. But there are so many amazing taqueria's around the city that serve up a true 4 or 5 star burrito that I didn't want to skew my reviews for those other establishments.
