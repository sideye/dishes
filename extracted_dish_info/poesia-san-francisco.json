This was probably due to it being a warm day, but that's no excuse to serve warm wine. My boyfriend got a negroni that was one of the better negronis I've had.\n\nAmbiance:\nIt was very dark, and I couldn't help but wonder if this was to hide the dinginess of the place. I would like to see Poesia throw the curtains open and have a clean and better lit space. If you can get a seat on their balcony, ignore this section.\n\nOlive Marinate:\nThese were pretty good for the small price paid. You can taste the citrus and they have fresh herbs sprinkled on them. \n\nOrecchiette con Purea di Fave e Pomodorini:\nThis dish was very interesting and has a lot of potential. Orecchiette is served over a good amount of pur\u00e9ed fava beans, which gives this vegetarian dish some substance. This is paired with Swiss chard and smoked ricotta - both giving the dish a very unique and earthy taste that was delicious. I think more salt may have been needed when cooking to make the chard pop a little bit more, but overall this was a good dish.\n\nFettuccine al Rag\u00fa di Agnello:\nThis was a great dish.

Most of the time pasta sauce is better after you let it sit for a while. \n\nWe also ordered 2 desserts - they had only heard one of them, so we only got that dessert until we asked about it. No apologies for the mistake - only a little bit of blame on us. Regardless, we got the dark chocolate mousse (spuma di cioccolato) which was good except the sea salt grains were definitely a bit too large for the flavor they were trying to go for. Some of the bites were definitely too salty for a dessert. The other dessert - tiramisu - was delicious though. \n\nCame again on a Friday for happy hour. Happy hour ends at 6:30 rather than at 7 which is what my friend thought it was. They still gave us happy hour pricing - thanks! - since we were like a minute late. I ordered the Seduced and Abandoned - which was yummy! We also ordered the buratta with prosciutto and asparagus (burrata con prosciutto staginato e asparagi). Delicious. I'm glad that they also give us bread because the three together on some bread is so delicious. \n\nThird time here, on a date, Friday night. The dining table was packed We started with the ricotta gnocchi (gnocchi di ricotta con pomodorini). It was light and fluffy with a delicious sauce. Definitely one of those things you should get as an appetizer - super delicious. We ended up ordering the ravioli special and the fettuccine with lamb ragu (fettuccine al ragu' di agnello). Both of which are delicious. The special was definitely good, but I definitely enjoyed the lamb ragu more. \n\nOverall, this location has really good Italian food.

Happy hour ends at 6:30 rather than at 7 which is what my friend thought it was. They still gave us happy hour pricing - thanks! - since we were like a minute late.

The citrus sauce was a tiny bit strong, and that in combination withe tangy juice from the tomatoes made the dish less savory and more sour. The slices of tomatoes themselves were fantastic, perfectly ripe, almost sweet.\n\n* Tortino di Baccala di Nonna MariaRosa - 3.5 stars\n(Salted Cod cake baked in the oven with potato puree. $11)\nNicely done. The cod had great texture, as did the potato puree. A little bland flavor-wise though.\n\n~~PASTA~~\n* Fettuccine al Ragu d'Agnello - 4 stars\n(Lamb Shank  Ragu', Tomato Sauce. $16)\nThe house made fettuccine was really great. FYI it is thicker (though also variable, so you can tell it's made in house) and on the al dente side. The sauce had a nice tangy flavor that balanced well with the gamey flavor of the lamb. Speaking of the lamb, it was tender and tasty. \n\n* Pollo alla Griglia con Salsa Piccante - 4 stars\n(Free Range Half Chicken, Lemon & Peperoncino Calabrese Sauce, Broccoli di Ciccio, Roasted Potatoes. $19)\nWhile the chicken was a tiny bit on the dry side, it was flavored so well with many spices and herbs that made it smell (and taste) delicious.

The potato was really good, also with a nice crisp and well flavored, and the greens were slightly bitter which balanced everything else out really well.\n\n~~DOLCI~~ \n* Zabaione al Marsala con Sbrisolona e Gelato - 2 stars\n(Light Marsala wine custard with Almond short dough and Chocolate Gelato. $8)\nVery disappointing (we should've listened to our waiter who was kind of pushing for the other dessert).

You have to balance out each bite to get the right amount of salt, olive oil, and chile to get the flavor right.

Probably since from the looks of it, it was converted from a house.  \n\nAs one of our apps, we ordered the filet carpaccio, which came on a bed of and wrapped around arugula salad.  Firstly, it came with very little of the citrusy/vinegary sauce that usually compliments this dish.  Then the filet wasn't cut thinly enough where it felt as tho I was chewing on meat gum.  And I'm sure as many people have, after chewing and chewing and chewing, trying every teeth to grind the sucker down with no luck, I decided to swallow the gristly chunk instead of spitting it out into my napkin.  \n\nThe other app, grilled squid, on a bed of arugula again, was actually quite good.  Probably one of the better grilled squids that I've had.  Perfectly cooked to the point that is neither under-cooked mushy or over-cooked rubbery with a nice smoking grilled flavor rather than burnt bitterness.  The citrusy sauce, which seems similar to the one that came with the carpaccio, complimented it well.  \n\nAs one of our entrees, we ordered the filet, which to our surprise, came on a bed of arugula, again.  I guess we didn't read the menu carefully enough to notice that we had signed up for an arugula colon cleansing.  I don't recall the salad saying specifically that it was arugula.  I could be wrong.  Again, it came with a very similar, if not the same, citrusy sauce as the first two dishes.  Perhaps, if this was the only dish that came with it, then I could tolerate it but given all 3 came on a bed of citrusy arugula, it was hard to bare.  Even though we ordered it medium, it was quite dry and it needed some sort of a reduction sauce.   \n\nThe red snapper ravioli in asparagus sauce dish was quite good but had only 4 pieces.  My friend said that the pasta was under cooked on her first piece.  Mine seemed ok.\n\nThe desserts were good, although the tiramisu didn't quite taste like a real one.  Maybe because it was missing too many of its signature ingredients - coffee/espresso & liquor?  \n\nThe service from our friendly waiter was decent.  \n\nI would give this restaurant a 3 star rating had it not been for what had happened AFTER our dining experience.  We couldn't quite finish the filet and the third course of arugula, so we asked for it to go.  one of the waiters took the dish to the back to, I assume, box & bag it.  Normally I expect the restaurant to bring it to the table.  Because we were focused on our conversation, after the bill had come, we left the restaurant.  After having driven far quite far, we realized that they had not given us the togo box.  \n\nInstead of turning back for our arugula and the filet, I decided to call the restaurant to bring up the matter after getting home. When I did, the attitude that the manager had was basically, 'what do you want me to do about it?  It's just as much your fault as it is ours.  You should not have forgotten.'  I am all about being fair and only raising an issue when I feel that it's due.  Had they brought the box to me and then I had forgotten it on the table, then yes, I accept the fault as my own.  Even if the manager's excuse was true that they do not want to bring the box to the table and would prefer to give it to the customers as they leave, then it should be their duty to remember to do so, not the customers.\n\nRestaurants should remember that they are just as much a service business.

Only one of us was wearing a wedding ring, which made three of us, apparently, fair game. The bartender was particularly amicable, mixing us some strong Negronis, making great wine recommendations (like a Monchiero Carbone, Roero Printi 2004), and even going so far as to give my friend a massage...(that's in the good waiters' handbook somewhere, right?).\n\nThe pastas are all handmade - no self respecting Italian would have it any other way - and so our meal consisted of a fantastic cauliflower orrechietti and the tantalizing burrata and eggplant tortelloni. We also had an off menu risotto that was sublime in texture/taste/consistency.  Some of our other choices were very good, but they didn't match the brilliance of these three dishes. Our pork ribs, rack of lamb and filet mignon were all highly respectable, with the only outcasts being the gnocchi and arancini, which bummed us out given how much we love both these dishes. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and a cannoli - both textbook Italian/Sicilian perfection.\n\nConsider this: there's Italian food, Italian cooking and Italian restaurants (Sbarro be damned). Italian food can be made by anyone that can follow some simple instructions with a few key ingredients; Italian cooking - not to be confused with a cooking Italian - can be achieved through hard work and careful study (personally, I recommend Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking by Marcella Hazan); and Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, which is why selectivity is essential (and why Yelp.* is god's gift to foodies).\n\nIn the instances when you discover a place that fits all of the above (and throw in a cooking Italian, to boot), you've got yourself a rare find. The size of this place alone is a testament to its authenticity. Restaurants in Italy are generally TINY, and the chefs are their embodiment in personality, style and substance. As such, chefs take great care to see, socialize, listen to, and enjoy their patrons. Francesco d'Ippolito, Poesia's chef, works the dining room and the kitchen, because that is how it is done en Italia.  If your meal takes anything short of two hours, then you've rushed things and probably missed out on something. Instead, expect to come for an evening and lose track of (and interest in) the time.\n\nAll told, think of Poesia not as a restaurant, but as a first rate Italian kitchen. Francesco even cooks with the \"TV\" on, projecting old B&W  Italian films on the wall (boy, did I ever miss the memo on this trend http://www.yelp.com/biz/specchio-san-francisco#hrid:Wz8rbSeL3drmhqk6wm9z3g).\n\nAnd like all good Italian kitchens, no one walks away hungry.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-08-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The tiramisu was a layer of flavors, that thank goodness the chef had the good sense NOT to drown in cocoa powder.
