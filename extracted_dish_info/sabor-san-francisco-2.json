"], "author": "Osberto M.", "review": "I've eaten here a few times within the last two months.  I was born and raised in Guatemala, and have had these dishes all my life both at home and outside.\n\nIn my opinion, the 'caldo de res' (a simple but really tasty beef stock with beef chunks and vegetables in it) is 5 stars, and the 'caq-ik'  (Q'eqchi language name for the dish) is worth 3 1/2. I am not used to having the caq-ik broth be this thick.  As far as I am concerned caq-ik is meant to be just like caldo de res in terms of consistency, but perhaps this varies. Either way, I think I remember a more intense flavor. \n\nRellenitos de platano (mashed plantain paste filled with fried beans and then itself fried) were awesome and unhealthy as expected. \n\nTheir menu could be richer. I don't think I saw 'pollo en jocon', 'saq-ik', 'caldo de gallina', 'salpicon de panza', and such things. It would also be great if they had thick, handmade corn tortillas, but these hardly appear anywhere I go so I cannot hold it against them. It would be also nice if besides rellenitos de platano they also offered simply sliced fried plantain with fried beans on the side as well, or fried banana. All of it may seem redundant but they are good in their own special ways.\n\nService is friendly but slow, they will take time to bring the beer (they have some of the Guatemalan beers there, for the curious), the food and the bill.  They do check on you to see if you are missing tortillas for your meal, and they also offer a couple of courtesy melon slices some times.\n\nFinally, the thing that really goes against them is the aspect of the place. Poorly lit, smells like fish (hopefully from the fish dishes they serve), somewhat shabby. They could improve a lot on this and that would get them 4 starts. Don't be misled, the fishy smell at the entrance has very little relation to how good the caldo de res is.  Plus, they have some very folksy Guatemalan music playing complete with videos of the bands, so you get to see that too.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-10-20"}], "platanos fritos": [], "platanos en mole": [{"excerpts": ["Guatemalan style fried plantain and fresh cheese)\n\n- RELLENITOS DE PLATANO (Mashes banana plantain with black beans inside)\n\n- PLATANOS EN MOLE (Banana plantain with special sweet brown (chocolate) sauce)\n\n"], "author": "Mari S.", "review": "San Miguel is a family owned Guatemalan restaurant located on Mission St. in the neighborhood bordering the Outer Mission and Bernal Heights.\n\nIt has been awhile, so this review is a bit overdue.

The service is good, very attentive. But the food can be hit or miss. The first time I came here, I came with a friend and we tried the ceviche. It tasted nice and fresh, it was pretty good. Also had the Pepian, the sauce for it was good but I was disappointed that they made it with chicken.\nThe second time I came it was with my parents. They ordered the sopa de res and were pretty happy with it and they have discerning taste for that sort of thing. I decided to try the mole and it wasn't very good I'm sorry to report. I'm not sure if mole is supposed to be so chocolaty...the chicken was sort of bland and chewy. Also the whole plate was sort of a mess I thought because the chicken mole was served with black beans rice and queso. It was just all over the place in terms of flavors.\n\n My dad ordered platanos en mole and there the chocolaty sauce complemented the plantains very well.\n\nI would definitely recommend the Pepian, and will try the sopa de res. Unfortunately they don't make rabo :(\n\nThe place looks clean, but it's kind of small and to add to the ambiance they play marimba music and videos of Guatemalan music. The place is definitely not good for large groups or even medium ones, four people per group tops.
