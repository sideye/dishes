Portions are medium sized. Not too small such that I wanted more, but definitely not Daddy bear sized either.

I liked that it had a different flavor to it kind of spicy but not to overwhelming went well with the crepe. \n\nThey have so much more than just crepes, I wish I would have tried their sweet, fruity crepes but I was to full. They have a sandwiches, waffles, burrito, etc.  A great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Good customer service.  Clean establishment.  They do get pretty busy but they are fast, just have some patience.  I really enjoyed their coffee and mimosa. They actually have a couple of beers on tap.

Perhaps I lucked out on the food ordered and the service, but my 5 star sentiment stands.\n\n1-Fresh pressed carrot and orange juice! I'll admit, this place earned an extra star for me because I could actually get this combination of juice, which happens to be my favorite in the world, and extremely difficult to come by in the US. You can get fresh orange juice, fresh carrot juice, or take my advice and get it half and half. Delicious. And just $3.50, deal.\n\n2-This is a crepe place. I mean I'm sure the rest of the food is fine, but the specialty here is crepes, so I suggest, you know, ordering a crepe. In the same way that the chicken fingers probably aren't the best items on a menu at an Italian restaurant I feel like anything other than crepes is probably not the best this place can offer. (Though the other food I saw come out looked fantastic as well.) I was especially excited about the savory crepes, which are far more difficult to come by than dessert crepes. I started my morning off with the Florentine crepe, a delicious combination of cheddar, spinach, cottage cheese and onions. \n\n3-Fresh fruit. The savory crepes all come with a side of salad, potatoes, or fresh fruit. I opted for the fruit and it was absolutely fresh. Like, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if it was sliced up just seconds before going on my plate. The banana, strawberry and apples were fantastic. Also, as these are ingredients used in their dessert crepe recipes, I'm betting they cycle through fruit here quite quickly, so things are likely to be quite fresh.\n\nOverall, great experience, and a delicious breakfast. My food was delivered to my table within about 5 minutes of when I placed my order at the counter, and was warm and melty. The coffee was good, and I even got it refilled for free.

My partner in crime and I decided to come here because it was right down the street from our hotel and we love a good breakfast place.  We ended up ordering the Florentine Crepe (spinach, cheddar, and cottage cheese), the Eggs Benedict, the Blintz (dessert crepe).\n\nThe interior was charming with an easy to read menu written on the wall.  The flavored water was refreshing (orange or cucumber, basil, and lemon). The portion sizes were generous, which also included a side for each order.  The system seemed pretty straight forward - order at the register, take a number to table, and the food is delivered 10-15 minutes later.    \n\nThe poached eggs were cooked as requested - yes, they ask for easy, medium, or hard! - but the potatoes were overly seasoned with rosemary (something I personally pair with a roast chicken dinner and not breakfast food).  The biggest dissapointment though was the crepe - it was good, just nothing special!  Perhaps I should have ordered something with sausage or ham in it in, because the spinach combination lacked umpf (maybe some mushrooms in to make it \"meaty\"?) The crepes themselves were much thicker than I expected - literally a thin IHOP pancake and not a more delicate crepe, although I suppose its thickness was deliberate in order to stand up to the filling, which was generous. Suggestion: Two traditionally thin crepes with filling instead of one thick crepe with lots of filling.  My partner and I also ordered the Blintz (strawberry and marmalade dessert crepe) and we were told it would come out 10 minutes after our \"entrees\".  Cool, but after a few bites of our entrees, we requested to cancel the Blintz because, truly, there was so much food! Our request was denied because \"they were already making the Blintz.\"  Really? You can't scrap a crepe? Can't prepare it for the next person's order? It's a spoonful of batter on a griddle! (I assume, anyways)  I'm not asking to cancel a 20 minute made-to-order souffl\u00e9 or a well done steak. Grudgingly, we accepted the to-go box with the crepe and took it with us to the airport.  Needless to say, when stomach space allowed me to dig in, it was a big soggy mess - once again, those thick crepes! In the trash it went.

Where did I want to go to satisfy this need? Squat and Gobble. I like squat because it's good and it's a nice place to hang out and just talk. Food there is good, but nothing to DIE for.\n\nI'm glad I wasn't able to go there that day after all. \n\nMy friend that I was meeting up for lunch was not anywhere near squat and gobble, and it was just more convenient to get lunch near the area she was around. I was disappointed at first, but that disappointment didn't last long. She suggested honey honey, and I said, \"fine\".\n\nDriving around that area was kind of a bitch. I've driven around that area many times, but it was still a bitch because drivers in and near downtown are just a bunch of impatient bitches. I finally parked around the restaurant. I was a bit frustrated from the terrible experience on the road, but I was more annoyed when I had to pay the parking meter. I live in the peninsula and I'm not accustomed to carrying tons of change intended for parking meters. I had enough for 15 minutes. That was annoying.\n\nI walk inside and meet up my friend. \"Wow\", I say in my head, \"it's pretty cute!\". We order quickly so that I can get change to fill that meter again. I order the pesto crepe because the guy at the cashier recommended it. My friend got the salsa crepe. I also ordered a chocolate belgian waffle and a cup of coffee. The guy also gave me tons of quarters to pay the parking meter. I was happy :)\n\nFirst sip of the coffee. \"Damn!!!!!!\", I'm thinking. Only in SF can you get some damned good coffee. Honey honey certainly has some serious good, bold but not too bold, slightly sweet, and aromatic coffee. \n\nMy first impression of the crepe. Hmm, kinda small, but looks pretty, at least. First bite into the crepe, \"FUCK\", I think. It was absolutely delicious. Every ingredient was flavorful and fresh. I'm not kidding you. Crepevine aint got nothing on honey honey. \n\nFirst bite into that chocolate waffle. *OoOoOooOoOOo*, chocolate GOODNESS. I can't explain it. It was great. The warm, melted chocolate had taken over my taste buds and I was damn near nirvana, I gotta say.\n\nAfter lunch, we chit chatted, drank some more coffee, and smoked a few cigarettes (outdoor seating available). I was no longer sore about the shitty experience driving around that area. I was also fine with needing to get quarters every 40 minutes to feed that meter. (even though my friend ran to the meter and inserted the quarters cuz i'm fuckin lazy) Honey Honey was well worth the minor annoyances of life :)\n\nlove honey honey!!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["i had the salsa crepe which was good and packed with cheese and well, salsa.

It had swiss cheese, tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil, and chicken breast of course. Sounds weird for breakfast but it was so tasty. It came with potatoes as well. \n\nOn our second visit I couldn't decide what to order since they have such a selection of food that sounds good. Since I hardly eat crepes and this was our last day in town, I decided to go with another crepe plate. I had the North Beach crepe. Swiss cheese, onion, mushrooms, spinach, chicken breast topped with a hollandaise sauce/cream, and of course with their potatoes. Yes, I remembered all this haha. I liked that it had a different flavor to it kind of spicy but not to overwhelming went well with the crepe. \n\nThey have so much more than just crepes, I wish I would have tried their sweet, fruity crepes but I was to full. They have a sandwiches, waffles, burrito, etc.  A great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Good customer service.  Clean establishment.  They do get pretty busy but they are fast, just have some patience.  I really enjoyed their coffee and mimosa. They actually have a couple of beers on tap. Good prices for the amount of food and quality/taste of the food.  It all tasted so fresh.

Some of the toppings were not sliced very well. For example, I got huge onion and tomato pieces. The onions were very raw. Luckily, I love eating vegetables. In addition, I saw a weird bulge in one part of the crepe. When I cut it open with my knife, I noticed it was a huge chunk of feta cheese about 1.5\" to 2\" in diameter! I was also given only two  artichoke pieces. \n\nI was a little disappointed about the salad. The salad looked like the cheap, generic salad mix you can get at Safeway. It was a bit dry and I wished I got the potatoes or fruit side option instead. I tried my friend's potatoes and found it to be delicious! It was super crunchy and had a lot of seasoning on it. I also noticed the fruit side option to look very fresh. I saw tons of thin strawberry slices. \n\nIt was nice seeing that there was free Wifi in this restaurant.

The menu is HUGE so there's something for everyone, and you won't get sick of it because there's so much to try! I am one of those people that tends to stick to what they like once they find it, but I wanted to try so many of their dishes, so I'd be down to keep exploring their menu. Major OVERLOAD. \n\nAMBIANCE: stand in line to order food, then find a table and they bring the food out to you by order number. The restaurant is adequately sized, but it could be larger based on the size of the crowd it draws. When it gets really crowded, it might be hard to find a table, but the turnover is quick. The server was really nice and took our tardy party member's order so that he could sit with us instead of making him stand in the long line since we had already ordered and were waiting for the food. \n\nFOOD: CRAB CAKE FLORENTINE EGGS BENEDICT (10.95). As all the other reviews have said, this dish is bomb. Gooey eggs, creamy hollandaise, crispy (real) crab cakes, spinach!! YUM. The New Orleans crepe (9.75) was good too- sundried tomatoes and chicken breast up in here! They have everything, from pancakes, to scrambles, crepes, to sandwiches and pasta! \n\nSERVICE: As I mentioned, you typically don't really interact with the servers that much except when they bring out your food, but we had a really good experience with the staff who went out of their way to help us. That's what makes small places like this great! \n\nOverall, great value, especially in SF. $10.95 for an authentic crab eggs benedict??? What a steal in this day in age, IN SF.

I walked in and it was not at all what I thought it would be.  Expecting a cute, quaint spot for brunch, the ambiance caught me by surprise.  First, I could barely tell where it was (granted, I was a tourist); it wasn't labeled all too well.  The interior was interesting.  The walls were handpainted, almost in a Mediterranean style, but from the early 90s.  Instead of wait service, you must find your way to the cash register (if you can make it past the expansive menu...I probably stared at it for 5 minutes) to order.  No problem, I'll take it.  I'm here for the food after all.\n\nI ordered the SBK crepe, a crepe filled with strawberries, bananas, kiwi, cinnamon, and brown sugar served with a side of whipped cream and a side of potatoes (I can never resist).  I also ordered a chai latte.  Bad news first.  The chai was not chai enough.  Too much milk, but not terrible.\n\nNow, the good news.  The SBK crepe was as delicious as the description sounds.  It was aromatic, incredibly fresh, and somehow, not too sweet.  The cinnamon and brown sugar were not at all overpowering; instead, it allowed the sugar and the flavors of the fruit to shine.  The crepe was light, but still fulfilling.  The potatoes were homefries, but very good homefries.  While I did have to add a little salt, the herbs accompanying the potatoes were delicious.  The parts of the potato skin that were a little burnt, were just burnt enough.  Mm.  I love me some good potatoes.\n\nAll in all, despite the confusion at the onset of my trip, this was a lowkey place for brunch that I would definitely visit again.  As opposed to the fancy brunch places, one wouldn't feel embarrassed to sit at a table by themselves with a book.  In fact, it was rather comforting.  \n\nAlso, did I mention they had free wi-fi?

Instead, their spacious venue is filled with vibrant colors to support a family-friendly atmosphere complemented by a large menu, free wifi, and a good numbers of dessert crepes.

Since I paid $11 for a banana crepe at Ti Couz not too long ago, I thought the price this time was rather reasonable for what I got in return. I wish the crepe could have a fluffier and thicker texture while the restaurant could provide ample wall plugs for those who need to utilize their free wifi. Since their large menu has a diverse selection of dishes, I highly recommend this place for families and teenagers looking to make a quick stop for food as opposed to the many expensive sit down places in the area. The noise level however, maybe too loud for studying, but their wifi is still useful for those who may need it for other purposes.

They did have a good system of making sure you have a table after you order so the two stars are for that. \n\nHowever, the food did not get any stars from us. We ordered crab cake Benedict and the chocolate waffle. \n\nEggs Benedict-  The poached eggs were really over cooked and are just like hard boiled eggs. It was disappointing to cut your eggs Benedict and not see the eggs running. The crab cakes were ok and a little burnt.\n\nChocolate waffle- visually, it looked amazing. As we took our first bite, something tasted off. The batter was completely off and tasted more like a bread than a waffle.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not go back to this place. A 30minute wait is not worth for the food we got. Maybe stick to their crepes but we did not get to try those and are not willing to anymore after this experience.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-12-17"}], "eggs florentine breakfast": [], "crab cake florentine breakfast": [], "salmon benedict breakfast": [], "and  and  breakfast": [], "pancakes breakfast": [], "belgian waffle breakfast": [], "french toast breakfast": [], "salmon scramble breakfast": [], "croissant sandwich breakfast": [], "fruit cup breakfast": [], "fruit bowl breakfast": [], "side ice cream breakfast": [], "side one egg breakfast": [], "side  eggs breakfast": [], "side of potatoes breakfast": [], "fries breakfast": []}
