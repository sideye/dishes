Not like Pizza Orgasmica cornmeal crust (which, by the way, is awesome).  I'm talking about really crispy, kind of burnt, super thin crust.\n\nI've seen a couple of Amici's delivery cars around my building, so I decided to look it up and try it.  After registering for an account on waiter.com (I wish they'd just have their own online ordering system like Extreme or Chico's), I ordered a thin-crust pepperoni pizza, garlic breadsticks and minestrone soup.  For delivery, I clicked the \"deliver at 8 PM\" on the drop-down menu, since it was only 4:00 in the afternoon and I wanted a few more hours for the hangover to clear.\n\nAt 4:45, the doorbell rang, and it was the Amici's delivery guy.  Puzzled, I told him that my order wasn't supposed to arrive until 8.  He looked at the receipt, called the restaurant, and apologized for the pizza.  Not wanting to make a big deal of it, I just took it and saved the breadsticks for the next day.  I wasn't that hungry yet, but the minestrone soup was delicious, and just a cup of it made me full enough to only have one slice of pizza.\n\nThe pizza is eh.  I loved the thin-crust, but there was something about the cheese and the little baby pepperonis that just didn't quite add up in my head.  Since I ate most of it the next day and it just wasn't the type of pizza that you eat cold, I'm sure that's a reason why I'm rounding down.\n\nGarlic breadsticks were good, but not garlicky enough.  Again, I'm sure it would've tasted better hot, but they satisfied my carb cravings.\n\nThe other factor in rounding down was for them not checking the delivery time.

Not like Pizza Orgasmica cornmeal crust (which, by the way, is awesome).  I'm talking about really crispy, kind of burnt, super thin crust.\n\nI've seen a couple of Amici's delivery cars around my building, so I decided to look it up and try it.  After registering for an account on waiter.com (I wish they'd just have their own online ordering system like Extreme or Chico's), I ordered a thin-crust pepperoni pizza, garlic breadsticks and minestrone soup.  For delivery, I clicked the \"deliver at 8 PM\" on the drop-down menu, since it was only 4:00 in the afternoon and I wanted a few more hours for the hangover to clear.\n\nAt 4:45, the doorbell rang, and it was the Amici's delivery guy.  Puzzled, I told him that my order wasn't supposed to arrive until 8.  He looked at the receipt, called the restaurant, and apologized for the pizza.  Not wanting to make a big deal of it, I just took it and saved the breadsticks for the next day.  I wasn't that hungry yet, but the minestrone soup was delicious, and just a cup of it made me full enough to only have one slice of pizza.\n\nThe pizza is eh.  I loved the thin-crust, but there was something about the cheese and the little baby pepperonis that just didn't quite add up in my head.  Since I ate most of it the next day and it just wasn't the type of pizza that you eat cold, I'm sure that's a reason why I'm rounding down.\n\nGarlic breadsticks were good, but not garlicky enough.  Again, I'm sure it would've tasted better hot, but they satisfied my carb cravings.\n\nThe other factor in rounding down was for them not checking the delivery time.  Thanks, I appreciate the efficiency, but there's a HUGE DIFFERENCE between getting your dinner at 5 PM, and getting it at 8 PM.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-11-12"}, {"excerpts": ["But I'm glad that they kept their garlic breadsticks.

Let's face it...when us East Coast transplants hop in the covered wagons and make our journey across the US, the first thing we look for after stabling our horses is a good pizza place.\n\nSo, I've made a decision. You must have your favorite category of New York pizza, a favorite Chicago Pizza, and now, a completely separate West Coast favorite. And if I am picking my favorite West Coast pizza...this is it. I mean, I have tried a lot of pizza here so far that I would probably only eat again if I were homeless, but this little gem (and you wouldn't guess that it is more of a chain than a one off) is different. It would be foolish of someone to try and compare anything to the masterpieces that come from NYC or Chicago, but it is safe to say, this place is good.\n\nNow that the baseball season is over, you will have no problem getting in here at anytime. And if they were open at 4am, I would be embarssed to say I would have been there.\nI went with a date and was sat promptly at a nice table in front of the window looking out on the main drag. We ordered a large (which is 14 inches, but seems bigger...yeah, a guy said that...but it's the truth) and it is plenty. In five minutes or less, the pizza was hot and steaming and smelling great right in front of us.\n\nThe pepperoni is fantastic. If you have tried to best places in New York and know the difference between Bella Grande pepperoni and the Wal-Mart pouch that Domino's uses, it' s a must taste.\n\nAnd the best part...the brick oven. The pizzas come out with that charred, black smokey crisp, without being burnt, and still having great texture.\n\nFor those that might argue it isn't close to NYC pizza, I will remind before you walk in that NYC is 2500 miles away, and for that reason, this is as close as I can find. I might be all about the looks like all the rest of those guys, but this girl is great on the inside too. Enjoy!\n\nPros: quick service, nice pizza atmosphere, great outside seating, brick oven taste.\n\nCons: price, and the fact that I can't go pick one of a tree to eat everytime I get hungry", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-10-22"}, {"excerpts": ["First off, you have New York pizza, typified by a thin crust that is foldable which is topped with a rich combination of tomato sauce and cheese. ", "This can be found at Arinell, not Amici's. "], "author": "Avery G.", "review": "Calling Amici's an \"East Coast Pizzeria\" is a complete misnomer, as there are two styles of pizza typically found on the East Coast. First off, you have New York pizza, typified by a thin crust that is foldable which is topped with a rich combination of tomato sauce and cheese. This can be found at Arinell, not Amici's. Amici's is trying to replicate, with some success, the pizza from New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nWhen it comes to New Haven style pizza, there are some significant characteristics: the crust should be very thin, seasoned with olive oil and salt and should never get floppy. This base can be covered with chopped clams, olive oil and grated cheese or it can be covered with a little red sauce, mozzarella and some toppings. Not a mountain of toppings, but some sausage, pepperoni, peppers, onions, anchovies and other bits to enhance the flavor of the pizza. Shape isn't as important, nor is cutting it into symmetrical wedges... but color is, as the bottom should have areas of jet black char from the heat of the wood or coal fired brick oven, and the top of the pizza should blister from the heat anywhere where it is not covered with cheese. Is your mouth watering yet?\n\nAmici's tries to replicate this, and in some ways they have: the cheese mix is pretty dead on, and the crust exhibits the sort of charring and blistering you would expect, though it isn't oiled and salted first, which makes it lose out a little on the flavor. For the past few months, I usually have Amici's delivered three times a month - and the pies are consistantly good, but nowhere as good as when you get it served hot at the restaurant.\n\nPoints off for their prices, the occasional delivery issue (getting a pie with the cheese all slid over to one side), and the piece of metal my wife unfortunately found in her chicken pesto pasta one time.", "rating": 3, "date": "2006-02-25"}, {"excerpts": ["but it's not the New York pizza that I've had in Brooklyn or Queens.

In my opinion, the nearby South Beach Cafe serves better pizza (when done correctly) for less.\n\nMy only real beef with Amici's is that they don't know how to cook bacon.

I like bacon, I don't like burned bacon.\n\nPastas are okay, and the meatballs with marinara sauce are very good. The restaurant is nice and the service is pleasant. Prices are a bit expensive.\n\nI ordered their garlic breadsticks once, with a pizza carryout order, but I think that they gave me the plain ones instead, because I couldn't see/taste or smell any of the garlic. They also seem to forget to add utensils and napkins (even though I asked for it, but I forgot to check the bag - my fault for not checking).\n\nI do like their fancy packaging (foil lined bags for the breadsticks, and foil lined cardboard bottoms for paper bags with hot food).
