Everything I've ever gotten here has been genuinely good quality, no cut corners or skimping ever, and I've been here probably close to a hundred times by now. Sure it's greasy as hell diner food, but it's delicious and served hot, fresh and blindingly quick. One of the most efficient, fast paced kitchens I've ever seen in my life. I will say that if you order a cheesesteak and expect a \"real authentic Philly cheesesteak\" then guess what, you're going to be disappointed. It's more like a \"grilled steak sandwich on a toasted roll\", but who cares, it's good. Their salads are really good too, if you want to minimize your intake of greasy fried deliciousness.\n\nAlso the service is friendly and like everything else, super quick and efficient. Your table will sometimes get bussed and cleaned up before you're even all the way out the door. This place literally has no downsides to it, except maybe the limited seating, but the place is a hole in the wall, so it is what it is. Whenever I have no idea what I want for lunch, I usually just end up coming here because I know I won't be disappointed. Keep it up V Cafe.\n\nP.S.

Thank god. \n\nMy only complaint about V is that the fries are inconsistent. Usually they are waffle-cut, the Cadillac of Frenched fried potato, but sometimes they serve crinkle-cut, kinda freezer-burned fries instead. Also, the garlic fries are sometimes want for garlic.

You know that one person that says, they have a \"quick\" question when you have a deadline to meet which then turns into a 45 minute monologue about their ingrown toe nail or how their breakfast burrito gave them the Hershey squirts this morning. \n\nYah, so yesterday was one of those days.\n\nAfter trying my best to nod and smile for 30 minutes, I had enough and politely tried to excuse myself.\n\n\"Sorry, but I have to use the restroom.\"\n\"Oh, I'll walk with you.\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's ok, I have to meet my friends for lunch right afterwards.\"\n\nAnd, these were my \"friends\" yesterday...like horny teenagers, they couldn't keep their hands (or their fins) off each other: http://bit.ly/2gFoTh0. I was like the third wheel watching them make out for the entire time I was at V Caf\u00e9 and from the looks of it, it seems like this is a common occurrence. How cute.\n\nI've only visited V Caf\u00e9 inebriated after a Thursday night at Holy Cow (next door). It's been years and it's a bit of a blur but I remember the food being quite good. \n\nOk, let's put this to the test...sober.\n\nV Cafe's menu is filled with your typical drunchies: fries, waffle fries, chili cheese fries, mozzarella sticks, buffalo wings, grilled cheese, fried chicken, fish & chips, burgers, and foot long cheese steak sandwiches. Everything is under $13. $10 minimum for CCs. There's only a handful of tables and there's even dog-friendly outdoor seating. Though...I wouldn't want to sit outside. \n\nI ordered the Half Cheese Steak Combo with salad (or fries), and choice of drink (includes bottled water) for $10.95. I added mushrooms and extra cheese for $2. \n\nThe staff is cold but they're efficient which is understandable given this is more of a late night drunchies haven. My order was ready in 5 minutes: http://bit.ly/2gSrqJh. \n\nThe hoagie roll was nicely toasted inside and out and was filled with a scalding hot mixture of thinly sliced steak, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms & onions, and lots of melty, stretchy cheese. It hit the spot since it was my first meal of the day but the flavor was off. I asked for hot peppers but this apparently translates to Huy Fong Garlic Chili Sauce here so it tasted a bit Asian to me (the cooks are Asian). The cashier didn't ask what cheese I wanted and gave me provolone by default so make sure to request a certain cheese if you want it. A half of a cheese steak is plenty but if you're going for value, then it's worth forgoing the combo and getting a whole cheese steak for $11 and save the leftovers for another meal. \n\nThe salad was fresh and topped with sliced ripen roma tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, carrots, and garbanzo beans so no complaints there. \n\nI read a lot of negative reviews for delivery. I don't understand why people order fries (or anything fried) for delivery when it's a given that it's going to arrive soggy from condensation in the box. But, hey...I've ordered $150 worth of food service at a hotel before and passed out before eating it so I'm sure they had their reasons. \n\nOverall, my meal at V Caf\u00e9 was decent but I prefer Buster's Cheese Steaks in North Beach. If I ate my meal inebriated (like I did years ago here), I wouldn't care about the off flavor from the Asian chili sauce but I hung up my dancing shoes years ago and traded it in for granny shoes.
