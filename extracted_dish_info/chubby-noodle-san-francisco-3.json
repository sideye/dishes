Either way, definitely skip this (1/5)\n\n-Korean Pork Tacos: The only good item of the day but was overpriced at $6 per taco. The meat was a bit salty though the flavors were good. The best part was definitely the tortilla. Everything was balanced and delicious but also something you can easily make at home for a fraction of the price (with the exception of the tortilla).\n\n-Spicy Garlic Noodles: I love garlic noodles so damn much. I want garlic infused into every last bite of it so I can die and go to garlic heaven. This got me to garlic purgatory. It's nowhere near garlic-y enough.

Brunch menu includes dumplings, pork buns, Asian porridge, and some other things you can't get at dinner. \n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu and these are a few of my favorite things (on the dinner menu... also sound of music puns) \n\n1) Salt and Pepper Shrimp-- 5/5 the best shrimp I've had, maybe ever. They give you either a spicy mayo dipping sauce or Thai peanut sauce.--I always go mayo. \n\n2) Pork Fried Rice--Always a yes. So tasty \n\n3) Spicy Garlic Noodles (I get with Shrimp or chicken but they let you add any meat for addition $$$)--So these I've had really spicy or not so much. You can request your desired level of spice, and either way they're always delicious. \n\n4) Green beans--I don't even like green beans that much but YUMMM do they put a delicious teriyaki sauce on them. A must-get in my opinion! Especially if you want to err on the side of healthy. \n\n5) Asian Fried Chicken--Basically boneless wings that you can dip in a spicy mayo dipping sauce, but they're amazing \n\nThings to Skip: \n\nDuck Lettuce wraps (duck is a bit too gamey) \nPoke (I've had better) \nPad Thai (not the most flavorful) \nAsian bone-in chicken wings (not the most meat on their bone-in wings)", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the pork tacos (not the biggest portion but DELICIOUS), while my girlfriend had the spicy garlic noodles (decent portion as noodles usually are, also amazing) \n\n"], "author": "Tiger Y.", "review": "Ambience and customer service was amazing!

I had some about the on tap sake and the Yona Yona Beer, and while he didn't know he asked the bartender and provided the answer. \n\nWe ended up getting a few items for the table. We were hungry, but not ravenous from the hike, so we got in order of delivery:\n\nPork and Shrimp Wontons: probably the weakest of the items, but not bad by any means. The  spicy soy sauce seeps in and gives it a wonderful kick that we all noticed. 8 pieces per bowl gave us each two, so enough to enjoy.\n\nPapaya Salad: this was really good, really light, and really refreshing. Yummy papaya, bean sprouts, mint, basil in a light vinegar dressing. Everyone got a huge amount.\n\nKimchee: this was definitely my suggestion, and I did end up killing it as it was great. Some of the Korean spots in San Jose make a pretty tame kimchee. This had a great little kick that wasn't overpowering. \n\nSpicy Garlic Noodles: not as spicy as I expected, but perfectly tender and did have some good flavor. Unfortunately I didn't know you could get char siu pork added to it, but it was great on it's own for the carb.\n\nTuna Poke: a nice-sized portion of cubed tuna that comes with those Chinese Shrimp Chips, so you can make your own little tuna poke nachos. Fantastic flavor on these, I think we were all being polite just not stealing the whole plate.\n\nDuck Tacos: generally when you see something like \"available until sold out\" you know it is going to be good. It exceeded expectations. By far the best item we tried, and we all mumbling suggested getting another order despite being full. Only one tortilla, so not purely authentic, but the duck is delicious and the bit of yogurt really does add to the flavor.\n\nAfter the meal but before the bill, I talked with our server/manager and one of the bartenders - as the garlic noodles were delicious, I asked if they ever did dandan noodles.

It's regular chow mein with a topping of chubby rice noodles for the Chubby Noodle namesake, but I feel like it doesn't actually go well with the chow mein.

There were two of us, and the waitress kindly explained that everything was family style and that for 2 people she recommended 3-4 dishes. Being the hungry fatties that we were, we went with 4:\n\n1. Chinese chicken salad: this was not my choice, had it not been for my dinner date I never would have ordered it. But so glad be did! It was delicious! The chicken was so fresh and tender, the sauce so perfect, the lettuce so tasty, I sacked every bite! I'd order this again in a heartbeat. \n\n2 spicy garlic noodles: despite the name, these are not, in fact, spicy. But they are full of flavor. So yum! A must for sure!\n\n3. Chile prawn noodles: we were actually debating between this and the spicy garlic noodles when ordering, but when the waitress described them both to us we just had I order both. Glad we did! This dish is the chubby flat rice noodles that grace their sign, and so tasty. Delicious sauce. Amazing prawns. The waitress said it was quite spicy but we didn't think so. Very very good. \n\n4. Last but not least, the flounder. The fish itself was quite good, but the best part was actually the mushrooms and veggies that topped it. So tasty!\n\nGreat experience, good service, reasonably priced, and I'd order ever dish again.

That price is actually pretty steep for the amount of chicken you end up getting, but at least the chicken was good paired with the sauce. The pieces had little to no fat which is what I like. And yes they are boneless. I also got the cucumber salad which was just okay. \n\nHowever, it was a big disappointment (and the reason this review is 3 stars instead of 4) to find out at the last minute that there are no forks, only chopsticks. Or maybe there are no to-go forks. Either way it's disappointing and annoying, being how clearly not everyone in America knows how to use chopsticks. So I'm supposed to just up and immediately learn how to use chopsticks in less than 2 mins when I'm starving?? What are we, in Kill Bill vol. 2?  I debated going to one of the hotels nearby and asking for a fork but I thought that would be tacky so, lucky for Chubby Noodle I managed quite well with the chopsticks. \n\nI'll be back, but I guess I'll come prepared with FORKS.

Besides the cute name and extremely close proximity to our hotel, the reviews and pictures of the food appealed to me. We didn't get a chance to try it until our final night in the city but I am so glad we tried it and made it our last meal in SF.  It was delicious and I will come back again on our next trip. \n\nInitially we wanted to eat in the restaurant but the heat from the kitchen and the lateness of the hour didn't agreed with our baby.  The restaurant is long and skinny with a handful of high top tables, a bar, booths, and a handful of low top tables in the very back. We chose a booth so we could sit by the window and let the baby look at traffic. I'm going to get real - folks with a little more girth would do well to consider the tables. The booths are just a little too narrow and squished for my taste but this may be because I had my baby on my lap. Between the two of us, he was just a few inches away from the table so it felt uncomfortable. Just an observation - I am well aware of the space limitations on everything in this city. \n\nOur very nice and accommodating server provided us with some water while we waited. My husband chose the Kobe beef chow menu and I chose the spicy garlic noodles with an addition of fried chicken at our server's suggestion. The wait for our food was about 10-15 mins, pretty reasonable with it being made to order right in front of me. I loved all the smells in the kitchen - it took me right to my dad's kitchen (he's a Cantonese chef). Even my husband commented it smelled just like my parents' kitchen. Once we got everything back to the hotel (extra sambal requested), time to dig in.  I am a fan of chili-spicy so I usually request additional spice to tune the dish to my taste after I've had a first bite. The fried chicken was delicious - salty, Asian spices with a hint of sweet. I expected just a few pieces in my meal but there were at least 8-10 pieces, about 1 x .5 inches - decent sizes!  The breaking makes me think of Taiwanese popcorn chicken so that may be their inspiration. Either way, they were yummy (more so dipped in sambal but that is based on your own preference). Finally got to my noodles and they also were very good - love the combination of peppers, garlic, soy sauce, and egg noodles any day and this did not disappoint. I will say I would found the dish to be a little bit more bland without the addition of the chicken. It wasn't quite to my spice level so I had to add sambal but that's me.  I would say on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being burn your face off spicy, this was more like a 2 or 3. \n\nI tried my husband's kobe beef noodles and liked those as well - especially the Szechuan paste. It was a little sweet which made me think they must incorporate soy sauce and mirin in it as well.  I used to think chili ran in my veins but it probably is more soy sauce. I found the piece of beef I tasted to be slightly chewy but that doesn't bother me. \n\nMy husband and I are chopstick users so it was nice to see chopsticks on every table (forks only by request) and when I asked for chopsticks to-go, they were already in the bag - no forks included. I feel like in such a diverse city not offering forks/spoons/knives right always encourages patrons to eat the meals with the preferred utensils. \n\nOverall the meal was delicious, even as take out.

Among other things, Leap claimed that there was an underserved market for transit in the Marina. Never mind the fact that it's already served by the MUNI 30, 30X, 41, and 45 lines which all run through Chinatown. Notably, Leap riders interviewed by the press often expressed an aversion to MUNI buses, saying that they couldn't deal with all the crowds. Translation: that trip through Chinatown was beneath them, and they just couldn't bother to mingle with folks of ethnic ilk.\n\nA similar dynamic is at play with Chubby Noodle, even if the setting is less blingy and more douchey - complete with a logo that - dude! - is a blatant Asian caricature. In a city whose population is one-third Asian, there are plenty of places for authentic, down-home Asian fare. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would prefer the bland and often sad offerings here over the real thing - unless you just don't want to burst your neighborhood bubble on a weekend morning and prefer a deafening, brotastic atmosphere with some cultural appropriation served on the side. \n\nPerhaps the best thing about the brunch experience is that it's AYCE, including some fairly weak drinks. To start, a bowl of breakfast jook tried to gussy up a Chinese staple with a dash of toppings like smoked bacon, but the actual congee itself was utterly bland and watery. While Chinese folks do indeed use whatever toppings they want, the underlying congee should hold its own without them - in the same vein that, say, oatmeal should. Then again, how many patrons here have actually gone to Chinatown, the Richmond, or the Sunset for a proper bowl of congee? Cue the sound of crickets.\n\nVeggies like the Szechuan green beans and the bok choy with mushrooms were more acceptable, although these are items that are hard to screw up. Of course, the fact that they're listed as \"wok tossed\" on the menu (itself quite a piece of work) must really impress folks who have never touched a wok before. Sure must conjure up exotic images of, say, Bruce Lee going all kung fu fighting. Meanwhile, the pork wontons and pork buns were passable, although I've had similar results from frozen fare. Similarly, the chubby chicken chow mein must be a good enough mess if you're simply not used to eating at real Chinese restaurants that prepare pan-fried noodles to crispy perfection.\n\nLook, I get it. For many people, heading into Chinese or Asian neighborhoods means straying too far from their comfort zones. If a fundamental lack of understanding of the cuisine doesn't already impede optimum menu choices from the get-go, brusque service and language barriers at many hole-in-the-wall Asian joints don't help either. So it's far less of an assault on the untrained psyche to sanitize, if not bastardize, the cuisine for non-Asian tastes and eliminate Asians from customer-facing positions - and the entire staff altogether.\n\nAdd in an utterly boorish, obnoxious crowd and some deafening overhead music - \"what better way to eat noodles than with R. Kelly singing in the background?\" as the web site suggests - and you've got a douchetastic venue perfectly suited to the neighborhood. And you don't even have to expose yourself to those folks on the 30-Stockton? Now that's hashtag winning, bro! \n\nIn the end, maybe it's a good thing that there are places like this to soak up the kind of folks who would gravitate to them anyway. Leave good places elsewhere in the city for folks who can truly appreciate, understand, and enjoy them.

Reservations accepted. I wasn't expecting stellar nor authentic dim sum given the area and because it's AYCE but for the $37 price tag, I at least expected it to be decent. Maybe dinner is a better reflection of the restaurant than their weekend brunch?\n\nOf the 12 items offered on their bottomless weekend dim sum brunch menu, only two were good. The other two were mediocre, and the rest of the dishes were PF Chang and Elephant Bar-ish; commercialized, over-sauced, and super salty.

Noodles were perfectly al-dente but too much soy so it was really salty. \n*Rice Cake in XO (http://bit.ly/14q6PBK): XO is a really pungent sauce made from fried fish and shrimp so it should be used sparingly.

Totally masked any flavor the dish had and just. soy. sauce. everywhere. \n\nHot and sour soup - Weak. It wasn't sour nor hot and it seemed like there was just too much going on in there. Too bland and not enough of the bold sour nor spicy taste. \n\nPekin Duck steam bun - Now the taste actually wasn't bad but it's the set up is weird. Usually, the duck is cut in slices so you can just pick up the meat and put it on the bun. This dish, you had to cut it yourself and it was just a mess trying to get the fat off. Could have been better presented. \n\nRice cake in XO sauce - This is in between the Okay and bad rankings. I liked it the first time I tried one but after the second and third one, it was just way too sweet. The sweetness overtook the peppers and just left it tasting like soft candy. \n\nKung pao chicken wings - These looked better than it tasted. Well, there wasn't much taste to it. It looked spicy and full of flavor but when I bit into it, it was a let down. I love chicken wings so I was pretty disappointed in this dish. \n\nOverall the place has a great atmosphere and awesome for dinner parties.

Sometimes they lean more on cool so the priceiness is worth it. Sometimes they are mediocrely cool and way overpriced and you feel like you're paying solely for Instagram popularity. Chubby Noodle was unfortunately the latter -_- \n\nDespite the name, there is nothing chubby about their noodles; on the contrary, the portions are TINY! We paid ~$15 per person and ate burgers at Super Duper afterwards. \n\nThe server recommended Korean pork tacos and spicy garlic noodles. The tacos are essentially the only thing unique enough to be worth getting, in my opinion, but taking into account the $$$ I'm not sure I would recommend. Everything else is overpriced mediocre Asian food plated in hipster fashion (e.g. + runny fried egg).\n\nTUNA POKE ($13) sesame, soy, sambal, macadamia | Not bad and I liked the kick of spice sauteed into the edamame However the fish was a little too mushy, and the portion size was wayyyy tiny... so tiny I felt like it impaired my ability to accurately assess it.\n\nKOREAN PORK TACO ($11 for 2) house made flour tortilla, chili yogurt, cucumber | Fusion masterpiece! The tortilla is very similar to that delicious savory wrap they use for TW beef/green onion pancake. The Korean BBQ pork was on point with the fatteningly delicious chili sesame oil marinade, and the addition of the cucumber and yogurt made it a bit reminiscent of time-tested Greek kebab wraps. Perfect in every respect until you realize it's a $5 taco -_-\n\nBBQ PORK FRIED RICE ($10+$2) Chinese pork, egg, scallions / add fried egg | We expected a creative spin but it was really just your typical BBQ fried rice that you could get for half the price at any decent Chinese restaurant. (Plus runny fried egg for the Instagram)\n\nCHICKEN CHOW MEIN ($11) house made noodles, vegetables | Nothing special. It's regular chow mein with a topping of chubby rice noodles for the Chubby Noodle namesake, but I feel like it doesn't actually go well with the chow mein. Fried rice noodles are not used this way in Chinese cooking... noodles as a topping for noodles hardly makes sense, aiyah!\n\nKUNG PAO WINGS ($10) arbol chilies, garlic, ginger | A little zingier than your average kung pao, but nothing mind-blowing (especially if you've had the famous San Tung wings)\n\nSPICY GARLIC NOODLES ($10) house made egg noodles, garlic, jalapeno | Definitely not the best garlic noodles I've had, but likely the smallest portion I've had -_-\n\nThe verdict: I would give Chubby Noodle a try if you are super into Asian fusion, have excessive dispensable income, or go die-hard on finding the best possible Instagrams.

My friend and I felt like we were shouting across our tiny 2 foot table.\n\nFor our meal we got the tuna poke, the korean pork tacos, and the spicy garlic noodles.\n\n-Tuna Poke: One of the worst tuna pokes I've ever had but I see raw fish and I want it. The quality of the tuna was pretty bad. Really mushy with little to no flavor. Or maybe that's just because it was soaked half a bottle of soy sauce so I couldn't taste anything else besides salt. Either way, definitely skip this (1/5)\n\n-Korean Pork Tacos: The only good item of the day but was overpriced at $6 per taco. The meat was a bit salty though the flavors were good. The best part was definitely the tortilla. Everything was balanced and delicious but also something you can easily make at home for a fraction of the price (with the exception of the tortilla).\n\n-Spicy Garlic Noodles: I love garlic noodles so damn much. I want garlic infused into every last bite of it so I can die and go to garlic heaven. This got me to garlic purgatory. It's nowhere near garlic-y enough. The flavors weren't bad otherwise though I found the noodles to be a bit overcooked. Price is alright for the portion.\n\nOverall, I left extremely disappointed. Definitely will pass on the dinner menu in the future.

The tortilla is very similar to that delicious savory wrap they use for TW beef/green onion pancake.

(Plus runny fried egg for the Instagram)\n\nCHICKEN CHOW MEIN ($11) house made noodles, vegetables | Nothing special. It's regular chow mein with a topping of chubby rice noodles for the Chubby Noodle namesake, but I feel like it doesn't actually go well with the chow mein. Fried rice noodles are not used this way in Chinese cooking... noodles as a topping for noodles hardly makes sense, aiyah!\n\nKUNG PAO WINGS ($10) arbol chilies, garlic, ginger | A little zingier than your average kung pao, but nothing mind-blowing (especially if you've had the famous San Tung wings)\n\nSPICY GARLIC NOODLES ($10) house made egg noodles, garlic, jalapeno | Definitely not the best garlic noodles I've had, but likely the smallest portion I've had -_-\n\nThe verdict: I would give Chubby Noodle a try if you are super into Asian fusion, have excessive dispensable income, or go die-hard on finding the best possible Instagrams.

The sauce is what sets off your taste buds! The container should be bigger to accommodate the amount of chicken given. Overall, this dish isn't to be missed. You will be in heaven with every bite! \n\nThe BBQ Pork Fried Rice is tasty. The pork is marinated to PERFECTION! What more to say, the rice is always a winner!\n\nCucumber Salad a must.

It sounds delicious on the menu, however, it taste horrible. Your given three ribs. MOSTLY BONE. Which isn't enough for the 15 dollar price tag. The soy flavor is overpowering and pugent which distracts you from enjoying the meal. I would suggest adding brown sugar to offset and compliment the salty element. I would never ever buy these ribs again. Complete waste of money!  \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty laid back. They have music playing in the background. Great playlist! However the music is so loud, you find yourself yelling. Not cool! The employees are always welcoming and friendly. A plus! No one like to spend money at an establishment that doesn't recognize them once they walk in the door!\n\nThe restrooms need to be cleaned on more of a consistent basis. The restrooms are unisex. With that being said, it frustrating going to a  restaurant with good food but horrible restrooms. They need to attend to the restrooms every 2 hours.

Be warned that the space is very small and I don't think they take brunch reservations, so coming early is definitely recommended. Also, beware that even with the size they still allow larger groups inside, which in our case was a bit annoying because there was a group of at least 10 that didn't have enough seats, so a lot of them were standing in the way of everything.\n\nThe endless brunch includes unlimited pick of 15 or so items, along with 4 glasses of one of their brunch cocktails. Although there's a drink max, they're actually pretty strong after you have a couple, so it wasn't as disappointing that there wasn't a bottomless option.

We paid ~$15 per person and ate burgers at Super Duper afterwards. \n\nThe server recommended Korean pork tacos and spicy garlic noodles. The tacos are essentially the only thing unique enough to be worth getting, in my opinion, but taking into account the $$$ I'm not sure I would recommend. Everything else is overpriced mediocre Asian food plated in hipster fashion (e.g. + runny fried egg).\n\nTUNA POKE ($13) sesame, soy, sambal, macadamia | Not bad and I liked the kick of spice sauteed into the edamame However the fish was a little too mushy, and the portion size was wayyyy tiny... so tiny I felt like it impaired my ability to accurately assess it.\n\nKOREAN PORK TACO ($11 for 2) house made flour tortilla, chili yogurt, cucumber | Fusion masterpiece! The tortilla is very similar to that delicious savory wrap they use for TW beef/green onion pancake. The Korean BBQ pork was on point with the fatteningly delicious chili sesame oil marinade, and the addition of the cucumber and yogurt made it a bit reminiscent of time-tested Greek kebab wraps. Perfect in every respect until you realize it's a $5 taco -_-\n\nBBQ PORK FRIED RICE ($10+$2) Chinese pork, egg, scallions / add fried egg | We expected a creative spin but it was really just your typical BBQ fried rice that you could get for half the price at any decent Chinese restaurant. (Plus runny fried egg for the Instagram)\n\nCHICKEN CHOW MEIN ($11) house made noodles, vegetables | Nothing special. It's regular chow mein with a topping of chubby rice noodles for the Chubby Noodle namesake, but I feel like it doesn't actually go well with the chow mein. Fried rice noodles are not used this way in Chinese cooking... noodles as a topping for noodles hardly makes sense, aiyah!\n\nKUNG PAO WINGS ($10) arbol chilies, garlic, ginger | A little zingier than your average kung pao, but nothing mind-blowing (especially if you've had the famous San Tung wings)\n\nSPICY GARLIC NOODLES ($10) house made egg noodles, garlic, jalapeno | Definitely not the best garlic noodles I've had, but likely the smallest portion I've had -_-\n\nThe verdict: I would give Chubby Noodle a try if you are super into Asian fusion, have excessive dispensable income, or go die-hard on finding the best possible Instagrams.

Reservations accepted. I wasn't expecting stellar nor authentic dim sum given the area and because it's AYCE but for the $37 price tag, I at least expected it to be decent. Maybe dinner is a better reflection of the restaurant than their weekend brunch?\n\nOf the 12 items offered on their bottomless weekend dim sum brunch menu, only two were good. The other two were mediocre, and the rest of the dishes were PF Chang and Elephant Bar-ish; commercialized, over-sauced, and super salty.

The first available reservations were for 10:15, & we arrived then & two other parties but were told to sit at the bar while they finish getting ready.  Boozy drinks were also included and you can order up to 4.  We started off the hoang mimosa.  It was refreshing but not sweet nor tart nor overly boozy.  Loved the cute mini rubber ducky floating in it.  Later on we also sampled a rose sangria.  I usually don't enjoy rose wine but this was light and not too floraly, with a hint of the fruit as well. \n\nWe were seated at a small table a few minutes before our reservation.  There were 15 dishes on the menu and 4 included boozy drinks and about 3 other wines you can pay an additional fee for.  We started off with orderinf the breakfast jook, hot & sour soup, Peking duck, shrimp dumpling & chicken Shanghai dumpling.  It seems that our waitress got mixed up & put in an order of the wonton soup instead of hot & sour, which was actually ok with me since I'm not a fan of hot & sour, sorry dear!  The broth was very light and had bean sprouts in it, kind of reminded me of pho thought it was a light duck broth.  There were also bok choy and three delicious delicate wontons.  Next came the star of the meal, the breakfast jook!  I always love a good bowl of traditional plain jook, but this was by far the best bowl of jook ever (sorry grandparents!).  Everyone has their jook consistency preference, but I like mine slightly chunky with enough broth (so not just chunks of the rice but not that liquidy either), and this one was this.  Plus the over easy egg, smoked bacon & fried bits of onion - HEAVENLY!  I was so tempted to get another bowl.  They paced the dishes well and we were always able to order more though there were a couple snafus but it's understandable as this was their first day of rolling this out.  After a little bit came the Peking duck buns.  The buns were so fluffy!  The duck was roasted though was way more fatty than meat but was a good attempt on a traditional dish.  Some of the skin was a little more soggy than crispy.  Half way during the meal they told us that they were out of the shrimp dumpling but asked if we wanted to order the pork and beef siu Mai instead and we agreed.  Next up: the salt and pepper shrimp.  I liked how it wasn't overly fried like it typically is in most Chinese restaurants but a teeny bit on the bland side.  The chicken chow mein was hot with chilies and jalape\u00f1os in it.  We liked how they put the fried onion strings in there and there was plenty of chicken in it as well.  The Shanghai chicken dumpling was my least favorite, I think due to the ginger and thick wrapper.  The pork and beef siu Mai, though the wrapper was very thin (filling fell out after first bite), this was excellent.  Great flavor from the meat combo & I would take this over the traditional shrimp, pork and mushroom filling.  Wrapping up the meal, we were told that the shrimp dumplings were now available and asked if we wanted them and we said sure.    We ordered their popular kung pao wings.  They were crisply fried and were covered in this spicy sauce.  Spiciest second to the chow mein actually.  I think it's just that they still needed time to prep some of the dumplings after opening.  The shrimp dumplings were shaped differently than the normal ha gaw, they were shaped like the scallop dumplings you normally see.  Again, thin wrapper, plump bits of shrimps formed together.  Lastly we closed it out with the shrimp fried rice.  Our waitress accidentally put in for the XO sauce rice cakes, but the she and the staff were very apologetic and got our fried rice out to us shortly.  The fried rice had lots of big shrimps and was simple with eggs, rice and some green onions.  We also liked how it wasn't greasy.  What I really like about CN too is their assortment of sauces they give you - a green onion soy sesame oil blend, the chili sauce and what I think was a very mild version of their hot mustard sauce.  \n\nI don't think everything that our stomachs allowed us to sample was amazing, but the brunch deal was a great deal especially with the four alcoholic drinks included.  I would definitely come back and try to sample some things that I didn't get to and some of our favorites like the breakfast jook, wings & siu mai!  We were pleasantly surprised by Chubby Noodle and I know that after this weekend, the bottomless dim sum brunch will be running so smoothly.  I would be open to coming back to trying their dinner menu as well.  Friendly staff, comforting eats, cute minimal decor, & good wine based cocktails.  CN staff- Can you please have the breakfast jook available all day?

"], "author": "Vincent L.", "review": "Not long ago, a startup called Leap offered blinged-out $6 shuttles from the Marina to FiDi, complete with a snack bar serving yogurt, energy bars, $7 fresh-pressed juices, and Blue Bottle iced coffee. Among other things, Leap claimed that there was an underserved market for transit in the Marina. Never mind the fact that it's already served by the MUNI 30, 30X, 41, and 45 lines which all run through Chinatown. Notably, Leap riders interviewed by the press often expressed an aversion to MUNI buses, saying that they couldn't deal with all the crowds. Translation: that trip through Chinatown was beneath them, and they just couldn't bother to mingle with folks of ethnic ilk.\n\nA similar dynamic is at play with Chubby Noodle, even if the setting is less blingy and more douchey - complete with a logo that - dude! - is a blatant Asian caricature. In a city whose population is one-third Asian, there are plenty of places for authentic, down-home Asian fare. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would prefer the bland and often sad offerings here over the real thing - unless you just don't want to burst your neighborhood bubble on a weekend morning and prefer a deafening, brotastic atmosphere with some cultural appropriation served on the side. \n\nPerhaps the best thing about the brunch experience is that it's AYCE, including some fairly weak drinks. To start, a bowl of breakfast jook tried to gussy up a Chinese staple with a dash of toppings like smoked bacon, but the actual congee itself was utterly bland and watery. While Chinese folks do indeed use whatever toppings they want, the underlying congee should hold its own without them - in the same vein that, say, oatmeal should. Then again, how many patrons here have actually gone to Chinatown, the Richmond, or the Sunset for a proper bowl of congee? Cue the sound of crickets.\n\nVeggies like the Szechuan green beans and the bok choy with mushrooms were more acceptable, although these are items that are hard to screw up. Of course, the fact that they're listed as \"wok tossed\" on the menu (itself quite a piece of work) must really impress folks who have never touched a wok before. Sure must conjure up exotic images of, say, Bruce Lee going all kung fu fighting. Meanwhile, the pork wontons and pork buns were passable, although I've had similar results from frozen fare. Similarly, the chubby chicken chow mein must be a good enough mess if you're simply not used to eating at real Chinese restaurants that prepare pan-fried noodles to crispy perfection.\n\nLook, I get it. For many people, heading into Chinese or Asian neighborhoods means straying too far from their comfort zones. If a fundamental lack of understanding of the cuisine doesn't already impede optimum menu choices from the get-go, brusque service and language barriers at many hole-in-the-wall Asian joints don't help either. So it's far less of an assault on the untrained psyche to sanitize, if not bastardize, the cuisine for non-Asian tastes and eliminate Asians from customer-facing positions - and the entire staff altogether.\n\nAdd in an utterly boorish, obnoxious crowd and some deafening overhead music - \"what better way to eat noodles than with R. Kelly singing in the background?\" as the web site suggests - and you've got a douchetastic venue perfectly suited to the neighborhood. And you don't even have to expose yourself to those folks on the 30-Stockton? Now that's hashtag winning, bro! \n\nIn the end, maybe it's a good thing that there are places like this to soak up the kind of folks who would gravitate to them anyway. Leave good places elsewhere in the city for folks who can truly appreciate, understand, and enjoy them.

Things are served family style so be sure to eat & drink a lot to make your money worth. \n\nMy fave dishes were definitely the baos. The pork buns and peking duck were so tasty!

The flavors were lacking and it tasted like the rice was just made vs day old.\n\n+ Chow Mein - I like that they had the regular noodles with crunchy noodles as well. It was tasty and not too oily.\n\n+ Breakfast Porridge - Yum! They don't really give that many spoons so be sure to ask for extra ones. I like the addition of bacon and it's a great feel good option especially when you're drinking. \n\n+ Green Beans - I enjoyed this dish! They were sauteed in a nice sauce that wasn't too overpowering that made the beans feel overcooked. \n\n+ Bok Choy & Mushrooms - nothing too special but it was a nice contrast to all the savory flavors.\n\n+ Fried Chicken - not the best in my opinion. There was definitely a small amount of meat for what it was.\n\nThe drinks here are meh. The sangria tasted watered down and more like punch. I would definitely recommend the cantaloupe over the sangria. \n\nService is pretty attentive to coming around often to fill up your cups w/ their little ducks, but they are strict on time so be sure to listen to how much time you have left.

I have been to a lot of bottomless mimsoa places, and I don't think I've ever been so blatantly jipped by a restaurant when it comes to drinks than we were here. The strawberry mimosas were SO SO SO watered down. They tasted like maybe they made the mimosas yesterday, let it sit in a shit ton of melting ice, and then decided to serve it to us the next day. It didn't even taste like there was champagne in there, just watered down strawberry juice. Since we only had 90 mins, we ended up drinking at least 7-10 of these each because they weren't really doing the trick. My friend ordered the sangria, which just tasted like a bad vodka cranberry. You could really taste the vodka in there which I found strange because.... it's Sangria. Finally, when the waiter came around to re-fill our drinks, we had 10 minutes left of eating/drinking time. I know this because I was keeping track very carefully. When he poured our drinks, he said \"this is last call for the drinks\". I'm sorry, we still had 10 minutes left and we are paying customers, who are you to tell me that this is going to be my last glass? Again, I've never been to a bottomless mimosa place where they enforced the time limit so much that they cut you off before the 90-minute mark. And no we were not being rowdy/overly drunk, they were just being cheap. \n\nAnyways, definitely an experience, definitely recommend checking it out but definitely not my favorite brunch place.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-03-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The amount of times I've been to Chubby Noodle Brunch is probably 20+ in my two years in San Francisco, and it simply never gets old.

Got seated right by the door, and our server/manager was fantastic. Friendly, polite, willing to explain the family-style ordering, and willing to answer any questions. I had some about the on tap sake and the Yona Yona Beer, and while he didn't know he asked the bartender and provided the answer. \n\nWe ended up getting a few items for the table. We were hungry, but not ravenous from the hike, so we got in order of delivery:\n\nPork and Shrimp Wontons: probably the weakest of the items, but not bad by any means. The  spicy soy sauce seeps in and gives it a wonderful kick that we all noticed. 8 pieces per bowl gave us each two, so enough to enjoy.\n\nPapaya Salad: this was really good, really light, and really refreshing. Yummy papaya, bean sprouts, mint, basil in a light vinegar dressing. Everyone got a huge amount.\n\nKimchee: this was definitely my suggestion, and I did end up killing it as it was great. Some of the Korean spots in San Jose make a pretty tame kimchee. This had a great little kick that wasn't overpowering. \n\nSpicy Garlic Noodles: not as spicy as I expected, but perfectly tender and did have some good flavor. Unfortunately I didn't know you could get char siu pork added to it, but it was great on it's own for the carb.\n\nTuna Poke: a nice-sized portion of cubed tuna that comes with those Chinese Shrimp Chips, so you can make your own little tuna poke nachos. Fantastic flavor on these, I think we were all being polite just not stealing the whole plate.\n\nDuck Tacos: generally when you see something like \"available until sold out\" you know it is going to be good. It exceeded expectations. By far the best item we tried, and we all mumbling suggested getting another order despite being full. Only one tortilla, so not purely authentic, but the duck is delicious and the bit of yogurt really does add to the flavor.\n\nAfter the meal but before the bill, I talked with our server/manager and one of the bartenders - as the garlic noodles were delicious, I asked if they ever did dandan noodles. Neither had heard of the dish, but they did start to scramble to find their own dinner for the night.

I'm not really the type to get too turned off but something like this (especially for a restaurant that's pretty highly rated), so I decided to give it a shot anyways.\n\nA friend and I went to their endless dim sum brunch on a Sunday pretty close to opening, and there were already quite a few people seated. Be warned that the space is very small and I don't think they take brunch reservations, so coming early is definitely recommended. Also, beware that even with the size they still allow larger groups inside, which in our case was a bit annoying because there was a group of at least 10 that didn't have enough seats, so a lot of them were standing in the way of everything.\n\nThe endless brunch includes unlimited pick of 15 or so items, along with 4 glasses of one of their brunch cocktails. Although there's a drink max, they're actually pretty strong after you have a couple, so it wasn't as disappointing that there wasn't a bottomless option. We also had a great waitress who kept bringing us sake shots so that didn't hurt either!\n\nIt's definitely hard to not go over board when ordering since it's unlimited, and I definitely went a little crazy. I started off with the breakfast jook, a breakfast porridge with egg and bacon that was delicious and soothing. I also ordered the pork and shrimp dumpling, duck steam buns (which are huge and filling and I definitely recommend sharing!), kung pao wings (not my favorite from the menu), chow mein, and green beans. \n\nEverything overall was amazing, I just wish I had paced myself a little more, because believe me you'll get full fast. I will say with the size and the amount of people that were there that day, and the fact that there was only one waitress, the service was kind of slow. And I did notice that tables that were seated after us got some of the same dishes we ordered before we did, but again our waitress was really nice so it didn't really effect our overall experience.\n\nI highly recommend coming here if you're looking for a fresh take on a dim sum brunch.

I liked that they gave you the carrots, cucumber, and radish on the side, but I thought this was a little too greasy. Same thing with the Korean Pork Tacos, but those were better in terms of flavor.

Like a rendition of bibim naengmyeon (spicy korean cold noodles), it was refreshing and had great textures from the crisp veggies and kimchi. The runny yolk cut through the heat perfectly. \n*Chubby Chicken Chow Mein (http://bit.ly/1Ih4OV0): Nice presentation. Noodles were perfectly al-dente but too much soy so it was really salty. \n*Rice Cake in XO (http://bit.ly/14q6PBK): XO is a really pungent sauce made from fried fish and shrimp so it should be used sparingly. Again, too much sauce so it was really salty but noodle rolls were firm and tender.\n\nD U M P L I N G S\n*Sui [sic] Mai (http://bit.ly/1tK8AVY): Reminds me of the kind you get from TJ's freezer aisle.

We ordered pretty much everything on the menu just to try it all. \n\nSpicy garlic noodles - 4/5 - Not quite as good as the reviews made it out to be, but still enjoyable.\nChilled ramen noodles - 2/5\nChile prawns noodles - 2/5\nTuna poke - 3/5\nKung pow wings - 3/5\nBbq pork fried rice - 4/5 - This dish was loaded with meat and had a nice oily taste to it. When the leftover sauce from the ribs was poured on it I'd put it at 5/5.\nPork ribs - 4/5 - the ribs were not quite as tender as I'd like but the sauce was so tasty it made up for it.\nSalt pepper prawns - 5/5 - Deshelled, nicely battered and a great tangy dipping sauce made this dish fantastic.\n\nNormally, I'd give this place a 4/5 because I'm definitely a fan of their food and I would make this a regular spot to go to. Unfortunately the atmosphere was so abrasive and uncomfortable that I need to drop it down to a 3/5. The music is obnoxiously loud and was just non stop low quality hip-hop. I'm not sure if they think they're a club or something, but they should definitely take note that if you're almost empty at closing time on a Saturday night, you're not pulling off the club/bar vibe. They should scale it back and let their quality food carry them forward. Until then this place is at best \"A-OK.\"", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-03-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Went to Chubby Noodle for a late lunch with 3 of my girlfriends!

The music is loud but it's good music so that really shouldn't be a problem? Why are people complaining? You go out to eat, not talk the entire meal LOL.\n\n-The popular Spicy Garlic noodles weren't actually that spicy :/ so don't be fooled. I think a lot of these people leaving high reviews just don't know what spicy is. Nonetheless, the noodles were still good. I was complaining about them costing 10 dollars but of course come to find out I couldn't even finish the whole carton in one sitting LOL so that's good. \n\n-The Chubby Chicken entree is also 10 dollars. That price is actually pretty steep for the amount of chicken you end up getting, but at least the chicken was good paired with the sauce. The pieces had little to no fat which is what I like. And yes they are boneless. I also got the cucumber salad which was just okay. \n\nHowever, it was a big disappointment (and the reason this review is 3 stars instead of 4) to find out at the last minute that there are no forks, only chopsticks. Or maybe there are no to-go forks. Either way it's disappointing and annoying, being how clearly not everyone in America knows how to use chopsticks. So I'm supposed to just up and immediately learn how to use chopsticks in less than 2 mins when I'm starving?? What are we, in Kill Bill vol. 2?  I debated going to one of the hotels nearby and asking for a fork but I thought that would be tacky so, lucky for Chubby Noodle I managed quite well with the chopsticks. \n\nI'll be back, but I guess I'll come prepared with FORKS.

Besides the cute name and extremely close proximity to our hotel, the reviews and pictures of the food appealed to me. We didn't get a chance to try it until our final night in the city but I am so glad we tried it and made it our last meal in SF.  It was delicious and I will come back again on our next trip. \n\nInitially we wanted to eat in the restaurant but the heat from the kitchen and the lateness of the hour didn't agreed with our baby.  The restaurant is long and skinny with a handful of high top tables, a bar, booths, and a handful of low top tables in the very back. We chose a booth so we could sit by the window and let the baby look at traffic. I'm going to get real - folks with a little more girth would do well to consider the tables. The booths are just a little too narrow and squished for my taste but this may be because I had my baby on my lap. Between the two of us, he was just a few inches away from the table so it felt uncomfortable. Just an observation - I am well aware of the space limitations on everything in this city. \n\nOur very nice and accommodating server provided us with some water while we waited. My husband chose the Kobe beef chow menu and I chose the spicy garlic noodles with an addition of fried chicken at our server's suggestion. The wait for our food was about 10-15 mins, pretty reasonable with it being made to order right in front of me. I loved all the smells in the kitchen - it took me right to my dad's kitchen (he's a Cantonese chef). Even my husband commented it smelled just like my parents' kitchen. Once we got everything back to the hotel (extra sambal requested), time to dig in.  I am a fan of chili-spicy so I usually request additional spice to tune the dish to my taste after I've had a first bite. The fried chicken was delicious - salty, Asian spices with a hint of sweet. I expected just a few pieces in my meal but there were at least 8-10 pieces, about 1 x .5 inches - decent sizes!  The breaking makes me think of Taiwanese popcorn chicken so that may be their inspiration. Either way, they were yummy (more so dipped in sambal but that is based on your own preference). Finally got to my noodles and they also were very good - love the combination of peppers, garlic, soy sauce, and egg noodles any day and this did not disappoint. I will say I would found the dish to be a little bit more bland without the addition of the chicken. It wasn't quite to my spice level so I had to add sambal but that's me.  I would say on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being burn your face off spicy, this was more like a 2 or 3. \n\nI tried my husband's kobe beef noodles and liked those as well - especially the Szechuan paste. It was a little sweet which made me think they must incorporate soy sauce and mirin in it as well.  I used to think chili ran in my veins but it probably is more soy sauce. I found the piece of beef I tasted to be slightly chewy but that doesn't bother me. \n\nMy husband and I are chopstick users so it was nice to see chopsticks on every table (forks only by request) and when I asked for chopsticks to-go, they were already in the bag - no forks included. I feel like in such a diverse city not offering forks/spoons/knives right always encourages patrons to eat the meals with the preferred utensils. \n\nOverall the meal was delicious, even as take out. Next time we're in town I'd like to try their stir fried green beans (they smelled AMAZING) and the AYCE dim sum on the weekends.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-05-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Oh Chubby Noodle.

Boozy drinks were also included and you can order up to 4.  We started off the hoang mimosa.  It was refreshing but not sweet nor tart nor overly boozy.  Loved the cute mini rubber ducky floating in it.  Later on we also sampled a rose sangria.  I usually don't enjoy rose wine but this was light and not too floraly, with a hint of the fruit as well. \n\nWe were seated at a small table a few minutes before our reservation.  There were 15 dishes on the menu and 4 included boozy drinks and about 3 other wines you can pay an additional fee for.  We started off with orderinf the breakfast jook, hot & sour soup, Peking duck, shrimp dumpling & chicken Shanghai dumpling.  It seems that our waitress got mixed up & put in an order of the wonton soup instead of hot & sour, which was actually ok with me since I'm not a fan of hot & sour, sorry dear!  The broth was very light and had bean sprouts in it, kind of reminded me of pho thought it was a light duck broth.  There were also bok choy and three delicious delicate wontons.  Next came the star of the meal, the breakfast jook!  I always love a good bowl of traditional plain jook, but this was by far the best bowl of jook ever (sorry grandparents!).  Everyone has their jook consistency preference, but I like mine slightly chunky with enough broth (so not just chunks of the rice but not that liquidy either), and this one was this.  Plus the over easy egg, smoked bacon & fried bits of onion - HEAVENLY!  I was so tempted to get another bowl.  They paced the dishes well and we were always able to order more though there were a couple snafus but it's understandable as this was their first day of rolling this out.  After a little bit came the Peking duck buns.  The buns were so fluffy!  The duck was roasted though was way more fatty than meat but was a good attempt on a traditional dish.  Some of the skin was a little more soggy than crispy.  Half way during the meal they told us that they were out of the shrimp dumpling but asked if we wanted to order the pork and beef siu Mai instead and we agreed.  Next up: the salt and pepper shrimp.  I liked how it wasn't overly fried like it typically is in most Chinese restaurants but a teeny bit on the bland side.  The chicken chow mein was hot with chilies and jalape\u00f1os in it.  We liked how they put the fried onion strings in there and there was plenty of chicken in it as well.  The Shanghai chicken dumpling was my least favorite, I think due to the ginger and thick wrapper.  The pork and beef siu Mai, though the wrapper was very thin (filling fell out after first bite), this was excellent.  Great flavor from the meat combo & I would take this over the traditional shrimp, pork and mushroom filling.  Wrapping up the meal, we were told that the shrimp dumplings were now available and asked if we wanted them and we said sure.    We ordered their popular kung pao wings.  They were crisply fried and were covered in this spicy sauce.  Spiciest second to the chow mein actually.  I think it's just that they still needed time to prep some of the dumplings after opening.  The shrimp dumplings were shaped differently than the normal ha gaw, they were shaped like the scallop dumplings you normally see.  Again, thin wrapper, plump bits of shrimps formed together.  Lastly we closed it out with the shrimp fried rice.  Our waitress accidentally put in for the XO sauce rice cakes, but the she and the staff were very apologetic and got our fried rice out to us shortly.  The fried rice had lots of big shrimps and was simple with eggs, rice and some green onions.  We also liked how it wasn't greasy.  What I really like about CN too is their assortment of sauces they give you - a green onion soy sesame oil blend, the chili sauce and what I think was a very mild version of their hot mustard sauce.  \n\nI don't think everything that our stomachs allowed us to sample was amazing, but the brunch deal was a great deal especially with the four alcoholic drinks included.  I would definitely come back and try to sample some things that I didn't get to and some of our favorites like the breakfast jook, wings & siu mai!  We were pleasantly surprised by Chubby Noodle and I know that after this weekend, the bottomless dim sum brunch will be running so smoothly.

The sauce is what sets off your taste buds! The container should be bigger to accommodate the amount of chicken given. Overall, this dish isn't to be missed. You will be in heaven with every bite! \n\nThe BBQ Pork Fried Rice is tasty. The pork is marinated to PERFECTION! What more to say, the rice is always a winner!\n\nCucumber Salad a must. Just cucumbers in rice vinegar with sesame seeds. You can't go wrong.\n\nThe Korean Pork Tacos were extremely greasy. The tortilla shells are drenched with oil. Almost too greasy to hold. Mostly importantly, too greasy and oily to eat. The pork is mediocre. It's flavorless and dry. I would have preferred the bbq pork used in the fried rice.The yogurt chilli sauce is pretty good. Nice flavor and texture. The best part of the dish. Definitely wouldn't buy the tacos again.\n\nThe Pork Ribs are EXTREMELY SALTY! The ribs are marinated in vinegar soy glaze. It sounds delicious on the menu, however, it taste horrible. Your given three ribs. MOSTLY BONE. Which isn't enough for the 15 dollar price tag. The soy flavor is overpowering and pugent which distracts you from enjoying the meal. I would suggest adding brown sugar to offset and compliment the salty element. I would never ever buy these ribs again. Complete waste of money!  \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty laid back. They have music playing in the background. Great playlist! However the music is so loud, you find yourself yelling. Not cool! The employees are always welcoming and friendly. A plus! No one like to spend money at an establishment that doesn't recognize them once they walk in the door!\n\nThe restrooms need to be cleaned on more of a consistent basis. The restrooms are unisex.

Didn't you see that Jimmy Kimmel skit?\"\n\nTwo things about this statement:\n1- NOTHING on menu is gluten free? Fine. I understand if your chef doesn't want to undermine the integrity of his food with substitutions, but when it comes to your customers' health, I would think they would be willing to make a compromise.  \n2- The Jimmy Kimmel skit she is talking about it actually completely hilarious. He asks random gluten-free people what gluten is and they have no idea. However, i DO know what gluten is.

Its really disappointing and upsetting that a restaurant would be so adverse to accommodating people with allergies. If I was allergic to peanuts would you have still put peanuts in the dish?? Its so rude to treat people like they're lying and that I *wouldn't notice* if some gluten was put into my dish. \n\nMy whole day was shot. Had to call in sick to work.

We ordered the garlic noodle (and add $3 for BBQ pork, seriously?!!?), the kung pao chicken, and the salmon sashimi. Each dish ranged from $11-$14 or so. It is meant to be served family style. We first started with the garlic noodles and I swear there was a funky garlic taste to the noodles, like it was spoiled? It had a sour smell to it and it was displeasing. The BBQ pork add on was mediocre. The sashimi was one of my favorites, fresh in taste and lightly dipped into soy sauce base. The kung pao chicken was beyond spicy. It was perfectly fried but the peppers overpowered the entire dish and we couldn't even finish the measly 8 or so pieces. \n\nSuch a bummer that my experience was below my expectations because I had really high hopes for this place.

My one piece of feedback here would be that w/o even asking us what we wanted to order (which we did, after studying the menu on our own), he proceeded to launch into a detailed explanation of both the drink and food menu, which we were forced to listen to politely for over 5 minutes. I think this would have been perfectly okay had we asked him for recommendations, but we didn't, we were hungry and ready to order.

Now for what matters, the food.\n\nWe began with the tuna poke and the chicken wings. The tuna was excellent and came out in 3 minutes flat. The wings were awesome but did take 20 minutes to get. We were told this is because they are double fried. We also had the bbq pork rice which beat the wings to the table. I could have used a little more seasoning in the rice itself but the pork was oh so good! Adding to the carb load we opted for the garlic noodles next. They were delish! I had hopes they wold be spicy but I think the chicken wings blew my spice sensor off the scale. Not like the wings were so crazy spicy or anything but the noodles werent even close to the same heat level so its hard to say. We finished the meal with the Korean tacos. These were good but not as great as I had hoped. I did enjoy the sauce on them though, it almost had this shawarma thing going on that I found very interesting. \n\nThe service was spectacular and attentive. I had a Pine Street Pale Ale beer that I had never had before so that was cool.

This was a loud restaurant on a Saturday night and I'm not sure its the same every night, but I would definitely recommend it for a night or with friends rather than a quite dinner. Everything we ordered was great but some of my favorites were the Chili Prawn Noodles (reminded me of Tom Ka Gai flavors), the Korean Pork Tacos (amazing tortillas!) and the Salt and Pepper Prawns (totally new twist on one of my favorite Chinese dishes).

The food is good, but definitely nothing exciting. It is overpriced for sure, and that is primarily the drinks are overpriced. Like $10-$14 a drink. The food was pretty standard pricing but I think smaller portions.  This place got two stars because the food was good, but if it wasn't it would have gotten one star because of its price and the bro-ish marina atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered:\nGarlic Noodles\nPapaya Salad\nPork Ribs \nSapporo\nWeather (Pinot Noir)\nSake Bombs\n\nTotal=$80\n\nGarlic Noodles: These were good! Not to oily and I liked that the noodles were thick and had a nice texture. Good amount of garlic too. Small portion. \n\nPapaya Salad: You can never go wrong with papaya salad. It was crispy and refreshing! Decent size. \n\nPork Ribs: These were really tasty! Fall of the bone soft and packed with flavor. Just the right amount of stickiness. You get about 8-10 pieces. \n\nAtmosphere: Great music! 90s hip-hop. The place was packed with Marina bros.  If that is your thing, go for it! Definitely not my jam. \n\nI doubt I will go back unless desperate for the yummy ribs.", "rating": 2, "date": "2015-07-12"}], "aiden": [], "labor": [], "bench": [], "schramsberg": [], "pushback": [{"excerpts": ["Super tasty Asian Fusion which pairs well with their drink selection~Pushback Wine or Cold Tea", ", maybe a cold beer?!?", "!\n", "While it's a happing new place in the Marina you see quite the eclectic mix, mingling, dancing to the 90s hip hop and chewing!
