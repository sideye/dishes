During midweek when she felt like it, she'd just leave the house in her pajamas and roll into one of the nearby bars. That was years and years ago and I'd not been to this part of town since, so when I drove here today, the deja vu started kicking in. \n\nUpon entry you notice that the place is sectioned into many little pockets of hangouts, all with ample access to one of many tv's to view sports. There's a small cove on the right side of the doorway, the main room with the long bar to the left and booths to the right, a step up the pool tables and then outside where there are three more levels of outside patio. Today, Yelpers basically took over the outside area where Yelper Euge L. hosted an SF Foodbank Fundraiser. I had promised to man the BBQ station so I went to the very top of the patio to find a Weber coal kettle and another large gas grill waiting for me. As I started firing the two up people start drifting in and even the manager comes out to greet us. I assure her that I will try not to set the back of her bar on fire and that we'll behave for the sake of the residential neighbors behind the bar. Pretty soon  ribs, leg of lamb, trip tip, whole bbq chicken and booze is flowing and every one is having a good time. Other treats where homemade salsa/guac, pasta salad, rice crispy treats, Pastry Chef Yelper Laine L's amazing cupcakes and tons of other goodies. To top it off there's a fried chicken cookoff going down with Yelper JR H. from Selecta Auto next door allowing the participants to fry up in his shop and that food makes its way over to the Tavern too. It was funny to be running back and forth between the two place carrying tongs, knives and trays with people in the streets giving me funny/dirty looks. As the night progressed we gathered everyone inside to the pool area and various Yelpers were auctioned for the fundraiser. Amongst the World Series, Cal-ASU sports watchers, and costumed Halloween celebrators, we became one large rowdy crowd. \n\nI have to give kudos to the staff at Valley Tavern because, not only were they super cool about letting go us rampant on the place, they were some of the friendliest servers ever, and more than willing to help promote the fundraiser. Hell they even let me cook with large amounts of fire and explosive propane :)\n\nGuinness on tap (a personal favorite) as well as many other cheap tasty drinks, great staff, pretty cool patrons and laid back vibe.
