"], "author": "Ahmad J.", "review": "Tenderloin has an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants in-fact there are as many as 8 specialized Pho restaurants apart from banh mi and coffee shops. I randomly decided to try Tuyet Mai one Saturday afternoon for lunch. At the peak lunch hour, it was completely empty. This seemed a bit odd as most other Vietnamese restaurants usually have a wait at this time. Anyway, as I had already committed myself I decided to push ahead and get something. After going through the menu, I decided to get the Duck curry noodle soup ($9.30) as I had not seen this item at other Pho restaurants. I had to pay cash as I think I did not hit the minimum required for cards.\n\nAfter ordering it was a long 20+ minute wait for getting the food. It seemed that the kitchen was working on a large to-go order of almost 10 servings that they had to fulfill before they could attend to my order. I got two containers, a large plastic container with the soup and another small Chinese to-go container with the noodles which was a good start as it prevented the noodles from soaking up all the broth by the time I reached home. Let's start with the good stuff. The duck noodle soup was pretty good. Even though there were no big chunks of duck meat its flavor came through pretty well. I was expecting it to be very salty but it turned out to be properly seasoned. Now for the bad. The quantity of noodles that I got was very tiny, filling about half the small to-go container. What's worse if that they were small strands that seemed to be left over from the large order. It was as if they just took all the leftover noodles from the last order and packed those off for me. This is just not done. Goes without saying that I did not like what I got.\n\nPrice-wise it was pretty cheap and inline with what you would pay at other Pho restaurants in the hood. Unfortunately, the quality of the noodles let these folks down which is a pity as the soup itself was pretty good. I'm going to attribute this to maybe a onetime thing and try them again in due course but given what I got I'm in no hurry to do that.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-07-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I am technically on a quest for B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu, but I saw \"Duck Curry Noodle Soup\" on the menu and had to try that.
