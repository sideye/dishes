Everything was fresh and well balanced; the vinaigrette had a perfect balance of citrus and oil. I liked how the walnuts were toasted which added a great crunch and nutty flavor.\n\n*Goddess Salad (romaine lettuce w/ pesto vinaigrette and beets): The crisp romaine was gently tossed in the fresh pesto vinaigrette. The basil flavor wasn't too strong and had a faint nutty undertones from the pine nuts.   \n\nBecause the deep dish does take longer to prepare 30-40 minute, if you're starving, it would be best to order an app or salad. \n\n*Little Star (spinach blended with ricotta, feta and mushrooms): I LOVE Spanakopita, so naturally I thought I would enjoy the Little Star; I did and then some. Let's start with the crust...I normally veer away from dish pizzas b/c if not done right, they can be soggy. LSP deep dish's bottom crust was hearty, crunch, and held up very well to the filling. The cornmeal had a slightly grainy texture that a added a bite to the crust. The outer crust was crispy on the outside and pillowly soft in the inside. The filling was FRESH--the spinach was cooked perfectly and maintained a vibrant green. There was a good ratio of ricotta and feta, so the cheese didn't overpower the entire filling. With salad and beer, one slice was pretty filling.\n\nOverall, the food quality is awesome at LSP b/c all the ingredients are FRESH, FRESH, FRESH!\n\nSERVICE: There are no reservations, so it's first come first serve.

I can literally pull out a map of the city and draw out places that I avoided because knowing my dumb-luck I'd bump into him during his lunch break or what not.  One of the places that I tried to avoid during the state of \"healing\" was certain parts of the mission.  With that being said, stumbling across \"enemy lines\" due to your friends dragging you out for \"semi-pity-yet-celebratory-your-single-now\" happy hour leads to a stupid drunk text/call that one regrets the following day.

A small deep dish is actually really heavy and perfect for 2-3 people.  I normally order the classic (Sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells) whenever I go here.  The Little Star is also very delicious (Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic).  It's normally a long wait if you order a deep dish pizza, but it's totally worth it.  I say order a salad while you wait.  They actually make pretty yummy salads here.  I've tried both the Caprese Salad (Fresh mozzarella served with sliced tomatoes, basil, and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar) and the Goddess Salad (Baby gems with a creamy pesto dressing, topped with chives and toasted almonds).

I lean towards a certain kind, mostly deep dish.  However, I love me a good thin crust pizza and I won't frown upon the thought of sinking my teeth into one.  \n\nHaving a great pizza place is important in a city.  Its close to having that reliable mexican burrito joint that you can visit and know what you are getting.  Since moving here, it was important for me to find great pizza I could eat as well as take any guests to  that I could guarantee a great night with.  \n\nI had heard of this place, only because this was the pizza Barack Obama wanted when he first got into office.  Yes,  I Illinois senator, living in Chicago, choosing a deep dish pizza from San Francisco.  \n\nThe roots of Little Star (I believe cause I'm trying to remember from a story about two years ago) come from some place in central Illinois.  I think someone moved from there to SF but brought their style of pizza with.  The key difference with this pizza, more than any other deep dish  is that they use corn meal and there is a fair amount of it in the crust and drizzled on the top of the deep dish.  \n\nThe addition of corn meal is an excellent addition.  I can't complain.  Of all the deep dish I've had, this is the only one that has had corn meal in it.  Of all the deep dish crusts I've had, this is one of the few that I loved eating.  It was a welcome addition and one I can't complain with.  \n\nSo where does the deep dish fit compared to all the Chicago standards?  I think its unique with the addition of corn meal.  We ordered the Little Star.  Actually, we ordered the Brass Monkey, which is the Little Star with sausage added on.  The 7x7 menu had Brass Monkey on it but that was last year and they no longer have it on the menu.  But, you can add it to the Little Star.  \n\nIts not as cheesy as Giordano's.  Not as marinara-saucy like the original Pizzeria Unos.  Not as buttery as Lou Malnatis.  Its very good deep dish pizza though.  \n\nSurprisingly, I thought the thin crust was excellent.  Once of the best and the corn meal crust really showed its strength here.  We had the chicken pesto and it was excellent.  Great thin crust pizza.\n\nWe had the garlic bread to start as well as the spicy chicken wings.  Both were very good.  The garlic bread is a spreadable garlic and butter at your table.  A slightly different twist on the normal and I liked it.  The wings were tasty too.  Not too spicy but not overwhelming and tabasco based as well.  Its served with a nice crumbled blue cheese dressing.  \n\nI had high expectations for Little Star and they didn't disappoint.  I can easily recommend this place.  \n\nI now feel at home.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-04-17"}, {"excerpts": ["If you are not a fan of blue cheese dressing, this will make you a fan as their sauce is again very easy on the palette. \n\n"], "author": "Michael C.", "review": "BEFORE YOU READ ANY OTHER REVIEWS, READ THIS REVIEW FIRST as I am from Chicago....\n\nThis is simply THE BEST deep dish pizza you can find anywhere in the Bay Area. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with this place in terms of what you get for your toppings. What makes their pizzas unique is the tomato sauce and the dough. The tomato sauce is nice and mild, easy on the palette, unlike Zachary's (too tangy....which pales in comparison....I would give them only 2.5-3 stars) \n\nThe crust is corn meal. It provides a nice and mellow sweet taste as your salivary glands slowly begin to break down those starches into sugars providing a nice backdrop to your savory toppings. \n\nRecommended dishes other than their pizzas: Caprese salad: mild and FRESH mozzarella in with balsamic and virgin olive oil\n\nspicy chicken wings: Fried to perfection, not too crispy, not too soft. If you are not a fan of blue cheese dressing, this will make you a fan as their sauce is again very easy on the palette. \n\nThere are 2 locations, this one and another on Divisadero. I suggest going early as they do not take reservations which can bring the wait to as long as 2 HOURS!!! This location is probably less crowded...and maybe you can figure out why.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-01-29"}, {"excerpts": ["We decided to try some classic items recommended by other Yelpers - including the Spicy Chicken Wings with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing.

It was fate that brought me to you. Let me count how many ways I love you. \n\nYou're always there for me when I need you. Well except when you're closed on Mondays. All is forgiven though, when I order my deep dish Little Star Pizza. It is seriously a slice of heaven. It contains so many ingredients that I don't like, but they're blended together so perfectly that it works. The spinach, ricotta, tomato, mushroom, and onion..so yummy. The cornmeal crust is the SHIZNIT. If ever, I want to stray to another place, I always remind myself it will not compare to you. It also tastes so great the next day cold, which I can not say about many pizza places at all. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu, my faves are the deep dish Little Star (duh!) sacrelige to order anything else. My thin crust fave is the White Pie with salami (as introduced to by the WC). I love the blue star wheat beer and did I mention the buffalo wings and the blue cheese dressing. Make sure to order extra blue cheese, it is divine! \n\nAdded bonus, their jukebox is amazing. It basically has every album I have ever loved circa 1999-2003. I love walking in and hearing all my fave tunes and then sharing a meal with the WC. It is the best. Their acoustics in here are terrible though, may want to rethink the brick walls as it just bounces sound across the room. The long wait can be a pain, but it's well worth it. I wish they delivered, but that would probably take away from the experience of what is Little Star.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-04-01"}], "ml lurisia lunch": [], "bottled mexican soda lunch": [], "izze lunch": [], "virgils lunch": [], "sioux city lunch": [], "reeds lunch": [], "lemmy lunch": [], "juice lunch": [], "personal cheese pizza lunch": [], "personal signature pizza lunch": [], "side mixed salad lunch": [], "goddess salad lunch": [], "side caesar salad lunch": [], "vanilla cheesecake": []}
