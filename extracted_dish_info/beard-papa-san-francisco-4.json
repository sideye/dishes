IT IS HUGE! not like those puny little costco one with frozen cream in the middle, (not that i don't like costco. their samples are awesome) it is like the size of your palm. They have eclairs, and chocolate and vanilla cream puffs, with a changing flavor. its either pumpkin, caramel, coffee, green tea, strawberry, or chestnut during the xmas time. The cheesecake sticks and molten chocolate cake thing isnt that good though. but that's only compared to the AMAZING creampuffs. They are crunchy on the outside, and they taste sooo fresh. and the filling is almost pudding like. The even dusted a little powdered sugar on top. I stuffed myself super full with like 3 cream puffs. Tidbit. bite where the pipe the filling in, or it goes flying all over the place, becoming super messy.
