It's not watery but the flavors didn't have the complexity I've tasted in better versions.

I order this 50% of the time when I eat Chinese and this wasnt so bad. I don't know that I would come back just to have it but I was able to eat a good amount. It wasn't very spicy though adding chili oil helped there and the flavor was decent. The eggplant was at least marinated in the sauce. Again not the best but not the worst.

They weren't overly attentive but I also didnt need much. \n\nIf you're looking for delicious authentic Chinese food, you're looking in the wrong city. Try South Bay. You can tell this place isn't one because the table settings feature forks (not chopsticks) and its called \"Shanghai China Restaurant\" yet doesn't serve xiao long baos and is missing other trademark Shanghainese dishes.

The veggies were overcooked and mushy esp the cabbage which should have stayed naturally stayed a bit al-dente. The pork was suppose to be sliced in strips but were cut 90% down the way, so multiple strips stuck together. The dish is quite salty from the MSG, soy sauce, and oyster. So, if you're MSG sensitive like me, expect to get headaches soon after and make multiple trips to the water cooler throughout the day. The 5 crepes provided are cracking b/c they're so dry. They're thrown on top of the carton without wrapping it. :X\n\n*Beef Stew Wonton Noodle Soup: Awful! The beef stew was hard, dry, and flavorless. The wonton aka wrapped meatball was horrendous; the center was hard which was obvious it's been frozen for a LONG time. It was overcooked to the point the edges of the wrapper had sloughed off and intertwined with the overcooked, soggy noodles. And, the bok choy is also overcooked, mushy, and no longer a vibrant green color. The broth is MSG laden probably b/c it was made from beef bouillon cubes.\n\n*Steamed Chicken and Veggies (from Special Diet Menu): Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT order anything from their diet menu. The dish consists of several slices of white meat chicken and frozen veggies (carrots, snap peas, baby corn, bamboo shoots). The chicken is DRY and tasteless and the veggies are overcooked and mushy. They don't cook it in oil or season it, so it literally taste like rabbit food. If that's their interpretation of \"diet food\" no wonder 95% of diets FAIL.\n\nSERVICE: \nI've eaten here once and the waitresses are rude and inattentive which is why I've done To-Go orders thereafter.
