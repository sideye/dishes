I decided to order the Egg Tart as per pictures making it look delicious.\n\nWith a casual debate over what the difference is between an egg tart and quiche (I concluded it was due to the size), I dug in for a bite. The tart was nice and flakey, while cooker thoroughly through. The one egg on the side was best placed on top of the potatoes to let it run through.

The food came out pretty fast and hot. The eggs Benedict was forgettable and I don't really recommend. The ham slices were thin and for some reason they added a slice of tomato to it that we picked out. I'm also not sure if it's because they poach their eggs in water with vinegar but the slices of ham had a sour taste to them. \n\nThe Big Joe's breakfast burrito was alright. It was more of a lunch dish than breakfast. Most of the filling was the seasonal veggies (which I think it was mostly zucchini and a little mushroom) and egg. I wished they used a little more turkey or bacon. The green salsa it came with was also very spicy. \n\nAs we were paying, a party of 16 tried to find a table. That's almost the entire restaurant.

"], "author": "Richard J.", "review": "First, let me say I have a biased opinion of this place as two people, very near and dear to my heart, just started working here. So...naturally I would want to give them high marks for friendliness and customer service....but I will let you folks judge that yourselves.\n\nThat being said, my review is based purely off the quality of the food and the condition of the place...\n\nBig Joes is a typical San Francisco neighborhood spot. It's small with not much parking nearby...so obviously a locals joint. \n\nThough small...the layout of the place affords maximum use of room and feels larger than it should. It is also one of the cleanest places I've been...compared to everywhere in San Fran.\n\nBTW, as an aside...one of the main factors I look for in determining how clean a place is...is through the condition of their bathrooms. If any restaurant can't maintain a reasonably clean restroom...which is visible to the public...how clean are the conditions of their kitchen where only staff sees? In my mind...clean toilets=probably clean kitchen, dirty toilets=food borne illness dirty kitchen.\n\nAnyway, Big Joes has a clean restroom.\n\nSo...the food. Sitting at the bar next to the kitchen, I could see their chef cooking everything. The kitchen looked very clean...and all the food was prepared quickly and all looked delicious. And...one of the first things I noticed was their chef knew how to make an omelette! One of my biggest pet peeves are places that serve omelettes overdone...which causes the eggs to get rubbery and dry. You shouldn't rely on the ingredients to keep the omelette moist! Big Joes chef cooked the eggs to just before being completely done...added the filling...threw on the cheese...expertly folded the omelette and pulled it off the grill just ever so slightly underdone! \n\nNow for those of you who cook...you know that food after coming off the heat continues cooking from residual heat for awhile. In this case...when my omelette arrived...less than a minute after being removed from the grill...it was reaching a perfect doneness! The eggs were perfect...the sausage and bacon filling was wonderful...it tasted great! I was also served some home fries...which were creamy and soft but with crispy edges...and seasoned perfectly.\n\nAnyway....give Big Joes a try!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-16"}, {"excerpts": ["For me: Breakfast burrito with bacon.

BJ's is teeny-tiny, with not a ton of space to wait. We ended up scoring two seats at the counter.  It's now c. 11:10 a.m. PDT.\n\nHere's where things get ugly.  \n\nA male server comes by and asks us if we want something to drink. We ask for two coffees and two waters. We never get the coffees or the waters. The horror. The headache. Ten minutes pass, and a different female server comes by. She asks us if we would like something to drink.  We ask for two coffees, two waters, and one orange juice (because we noticed it at another table, and it looked yummy). She gets confused and asks us if we want one orange juice or two. We clarify that we want one. This time, we get two coffees, one orange juice and no water. Our previous server notices that we never got our beverages and mentions that they were out of coffee at the time we ordered it, which is why we never received it. BJ's: you are a breakfast place, you cannot be out of coffee. \n\nIt gets worse.  \n\nIt's now 11:20 a.m. PDT. We place our order. For me: Breakfast burrito with bacon. For him: Breakfast sandwich with chicken apple sausage. Two waters. We notice that the two couples (one with screaming child in tow, for bonus points) that have come in after us have now been seated. We still have no water. Ten minutes pass. Twenty minutes pass. Thirty minutes pass. We have not received our order. Forty minutes pass. And still no food. The couples sat after us have received their orders. One table has a breakfast burrito, pancakes and an omelet. The other table has eggs benedict and a Spanish omelet. In the meantime, the female server has knocked into my chair serving other tables about 152 times--without apology. \n\nIt gets worse. \n\nMy boyfriend is way less patient than I am, so he asks where our order is and notes that the two tables that came in long after we did have already been served. The male server tells us that the cooks were probably just getting the \"easier\" orders out of the way before tending to ours. Really? I think a breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich are far easier orders to cook than eggs benedict or a Spanish omelet. I think what happened was that our server forgot to put our order in. We have now been waiting 50 minutes for breakfast. Not cool. Without alcohol: super not cool. The male server offered to take care of our coffees, which were already free because we checked in on Yelp, so he took care of our orange juice. When you wait 50 minutes for breakfast at a place with under ten tables total, a free orange juice is not going to cut it. You trippin, boo.  \n\nIt gets worse.\n\nThe kitchen slaps our order together. It looked like Ray Charles made my boyfriend's breakfast sandwich. My rush job burrito was similarly underwhelming. Nothing was seasoned or dressed appropriately. My side salad was deluged with dressing. My boyfriend asked for aioli--he received a ramekin that was about 1/4 full of aioli. \n\nOur female server was cleaning the table behind us, and she rammed the chair from the table into my boyfriend's seat. You probably shouldn't seat people at the counter if you're going to ram into their seats 152 times. It's just not cool--I think I have whiplash now.  \n\nWe asked for the check. Our female server, who has been completely oblivious to us the entire time save for smacking into my seat 152 times, brings us the check without taking care of the orange juice or coffee. Maybe she was on Lyrica. I have no idea. We asked the male server to adjust the check, which he did.  \n\nThe Silver Lining. \n\nOur male server was very apologetic and tried hard to make things right--I just don't think he had the authority to do so. Our female server?  She's on Lyrica, I think. And the orange juice was delicious.  \n\nI'd like to think this baffling experience was an anomaly, judging from all of the fantastic reviews this place gets, but man alive, it was the worst dining out experience I've had in a long time.

IT WAS TO DIE FOR! My first bite in and I had felt like I was in heaven. I came in thinking I wanted to eat a classic breakfast (pancakes, eggs, etc), but I'm sure I made the right choice. The size of the melt was bigger than what I expected. I'm a girl that's known to have the capability to out eat a lot of people, but for once, I was intimidated by the size. By the time I had already eaten half of the melt and half of the potato wedges it came with, I was close to being stuffed. Although I was starting to get full, I just didn't want to stop eating because that's how delicious it was. So, I finished the entire melt, leaving one or two potatoes.\n\nThe service was wonderful. The waitress(didn't get her name) was very kind and always smiled. Even though she was alone, she was very attentive! I was very satisfied with our service. She even helped us find our way around!\n\nI would definitely go back. It was just an overall amazing place. It's not very expensive, but the quality of the food and the service was stupendous!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-14"}, {"excerpts": ["And French fries in stead of potato wedges.
