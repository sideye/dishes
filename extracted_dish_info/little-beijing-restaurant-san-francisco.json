Each time they tell me 10 minutes. Still no food. Two hours? Really? TWO HOURS AND STILL NO FOOD????!!!! But, but... the restaurant is only 10 minutes away -- MAX! Thinking I should be heading out to find some food elsewhere. Even if it does show up, will be cold as hell.\n\n9:40PM Yay! Food! You want a TIP??????? After more than two and a half hours???? No WAY!\n\n9:50PM We're digging in.\n\nTo be continued....\n\n--------\n\nNow for the food review... I have a question. Is there one huge chinese kitchen factory in San Francisco with massive vats of the same stuff? Because this place tastes exactly like sooooo many other delivery places in the west side of SF (Sunset, Richmond, Glen Park). Bottom line.... Meh.\n\nHere's what we sampled:\n\nChive, Shrimp, Pork Dumplings (12) $6.95\n-- OK\n\nShrimp Chow Fun $7.55\n-- Oily mushy noodles, bland shrimp\n\nVegetable Fried Rice (free with order)\n--- Bland. Cheap frozen diced vegetables.\n\nWalnut Prawns $9.95\n-- Bland frozen (for near eternity) shrimp.\n\nSeafood Deluxe Soup (S) $6.95\n-- OMG... DELUXE???? I would have expected a cornucopia of shellfish and fish. Not so. A couple of shrimp and scollop pieces. The rest, frozen diced vegetables. Soup the consistency of corn huskers lotion. Corn or rice starch. No flavor. At all.\n\nSesame Beef $8.55\n-- Dried out beef. Softened with artificial tenderizer. Smothered in sugar.\n\nBeijing Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs $8.55\n-- Dried out pork chops. Not spare ribs. Fried in oily batter. Drowning in sugar.\n\nBlack mushrooms with snow peas $8.25\n-- Bland. Not fresh. A couple of mushrooms. The rest were fiber-y snow peas.\n\n\nNone of the dishes with prawns had much taste. The prawns tasted bland. Overall, any dish's taste aspects relied mostly on sugar, salt and oil. \n\nOne \"star\".

Their not cheap with their napkins though.. so kudos to them for the first asian restaurant that gave my table a \"STACK\" (yes you read right) of napkins! Now onto the food.\n\nThey gave free green onion pancakes... which was alright, but it was just luke warm and there was no dipping sauce. The dipping sauce would have given it the little push to make it really good. They give you free pickled cabbage and peanuts too. The peanuts are marinated and taste pretty good... however one of the peanuts that my brother broke into had a maggot in it... was kind of gross. Can't blame them I guess since it's not like you can was the inside of the shell. We ordered the spinach tofu soup which was pretty good... expected it to be pretty boring but not bad at all. We got the chive and egg pancake as well... that I really didn't care for. Was kind of too wet for me since every bite, some of the juice was leaking out... and it was kind of bland. Got the lettuce wrap with chicken... it was decent but they should shake the water off the lettuce more since water was literally dripping down my arm with every bite... but I guess that shows that they at least rinsed it clean... so oh well? We also ordered the hunan chicken, some vegetable dish with sugar snap peas, and a beef dish that I forgot. Nothing really stood out to me but nothing was disgusting either. Just not memorable but everything was pretty greasy though... which is expected usually when you're eating out... but it was a little bit too greasy for my liking. \n\nService here is okay... the older guy is more on top of things.
