A literal layer of warmth emanates throughout the place, an indication of the piping hot dishes being prepared in the kitchen.  Servers are courteous and acknowledge familiar faces like ours.  They bring out a myriad of side dishes including a whole fried yellow croaker for each of us, pickled cucumber, kimchi, fishcake, seaweed salad and vermicelli salad. \n\nWe order the kimchi tofu soup, with beef and medium heat.  The cast iron pot is filled to the brim with silky soft tofu, bits of beef and kimchi, and the pretty red chili flecks characteristic of kimchi.  We quickly stir in the raw egg while it's hot.  It's so good over rice which soaks up the flavorful broth.  The rice, by the way, is a light purple color as a result of combining both white rice and black rice together.  We've had the corned beef soon tofu before but the kimchi version is tastier. \n\nWe also share the seafood bibimbap loaded with mussels, clams, squid, baby shrimp, assorted vegetables like mushrooms and onions, and an egg yolk all piled on top of white rice which has a delicious crispy layer coating the bottom of the sizzling pot.  The only thing that doesn't seem to mesh with the other ingredients is the imitation crab.  Nevertheless, it is very satisfying.\n\nDoobu is the perfect warm-you-up-from-the-inside-out place for a cold, foggy San Francisco day or night.

Seating is mostly booth, but there are a few tables as well. When I went with a friend on a weekday for lunch, there was a decent stream of customers but only one waitress. She was super chipper and energetic though, running around to all the tables and keeping up quite nicely with the lunch rush. \n\nThey have a lunch special selection as well as a regular dinner menu, and we ordered one item from each to try it out. The regular dinner menu comes with side dishes in the little platters, while the lunch special comes in a bento box with fewer side dishes already planned into the bento.\n\nSide dishes:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#3odl1vIAIbx4JDNRG1IfEg)\nThe side dishes were pretty standard, with pickled seaweed, marinated bean sprouts, sliced fish cake, kimchi, and pickled radish slivers. There was also a fried yellow croaker (I believe?), which was a nice addition. I thought the kimchi was a little lackluster compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to, but I liked the pickled seaweed because of its acidity. The fried fish was okay, a little cold and not crunchy anymore since it'd been sitting around for a bit after being fried. \n\nSeafood soft tofu soup (mild):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#fKy9pVB7RjjSDNNGjw86Zw)\nThis soft tofu soup wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. It's hard for any soft tofu to measure up to SGD Tofu House, but there was a generous amount of seafood in this. There were small shrimp, clams, and oysters. The flavor was just mediocre though, maybe a little bland.\n\nPurple rice:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#j7X3LZIXSIyxJOOgQaADRg)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#a-q80BNeQSqvtaloEKA0Og)\nI appreciated that the rice came with a lid to keep it warm, but the kernels were a little hard in my opinion. I love the purple rice that's a signature of Korean restaurants, and I always look forward to the contrast of the softer kernels of white rice and the crunchier texture of the purple. I didn't really get that here.\n\nCombination soft tofu soup (lunch special portion):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#PiP0dNxCy774spxmT1-r4g)\nThe lunch special came with a bowl of combination soft tofu soup, medium spiciness. The level of spiciness cannot be altered because they premake it, and I did not notice any seafood or beef within the soup despite it being listed as combination. The flavor was similar to that of seafood soft tofu soup, not unpleasant, but a little bland. The spiciness had a kick to it, but it wasn't unbearable. \n\nGalbi (lunch special portion):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#X77erU_M0KGo-inviLx-sw)\nThis was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. I got the lunch special with galbi, marinated beef short ribs. The marinade was pretty good, although a little too sweet. The grill on the ribs was good, and the meat was chewy yet tender. The pieces were a bit on the fatty side though, especially near the bone.\n\nOverall, this place wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd return specifically.

In the heart of Japantown, I would never have guessed this place would be any good, but we wanted something quick before the Asian-American film festival. \n\nThe tofu was super-spicy.  First off, let me tell you about the 3 physiological indicators that help me gauge the spiciness of food:\n\nLevel 1: My scalp constricts and gets itchy.  This is actually a pretty new phenomenon, probably about 2 years old, after I ate a particularly large dose of wasabi.  My scalp felt like it was on fire, and ever since then, it gets itchy when I experience a medium level of hotness.\n\nLevel 2: My left nipple gets hard.  I don't know why, but it does, and it's kind of unnerving.  I noticed this, for some reason, after having the Quizno's hot sauce once day and I could feel my shirt rubbing against my nipple (not that I find their hot sauce hot, it just seemed to have spurred this reaction).\n\nLevel 3: My right nipple gets hard.  This takes some super spice to get to this stage.\n\nAnyway, the tofu at this place was right nipple.... err, I mean Level 3.  It was so spicy I actually coughed after taking my first spoonful of tofu.  But it was delicious.\n\nAs well, the galbi was quite above average, I really liked it.  The 2 Qs (Quality and Quantity) were pretty high for me, so this place was a real treat.

As a Korean I feel compelled to give some credible review so all of you non's know what's up.\n\nThat said, I may be 1st generation but I'm no Korean food conoisseur so I grilled my mom on her opinions for this Yelp review.

I said it.)\n\nDue to the proximity of J-town to my current abode we walked over there and checked out Seoul Garden's menu.

It's hard to explain but you can serve kimchi too soon before it's ready, this was on the other end of the spectrum. The portions of the other three (bean sprouts, fish cake and spinach) were small. Sadness.\n\nSpicy Seafood Doobu (Spicy, tofu, seafood. Exactly what the name says): Yay it was actually spicy! Mom said it was not bad, but then she also informed me that it had MSG. \"How do you know?\" \"You can just tell.\" \"But how do you KNOW?? Can you taste it??\" (I'm totally thinking my mom has some weird superpower to detect MSG in food.) \"Look it's thick and if you made this at home, you'd never add it so it wouldn't look quite like this. And most restaurants just DO.\" (Superhero Mom fantasy deflated.)\n\nBeef bibimbap (beef mixed with rice, egg, and other veggies in a hot stone bowl): This was inneresting. Instead of using bulgogi that typically comes in this dish, ground beef is used and marinated in the same stuff as bulgogi. There was quite a lot of meat and not as much veggies as I'm used to. It was not bad, just different from what I'm used to for bibimbap. Mama Han says, \"This is ok, just different. But that's a small portion for $12. I could make this way better.\" Bitchslap, Doobu. And yes, my mom's cooking is the shit.\n\nRandom: They played Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You\". Made me misty-eyed for the 90's and middle school dances.\n\nMama Han's conclusion: For better Korean food go to the South Bay.\n\nMy conclusion: For the best Korean food have mom's home cooking. \n\n(If I had gone by myself and I didn't know any better this would've been a 3-star review, but tonight I'm putting myself in my mom's size 6 shoes.

Good sign.  Plus, the other Korean restaurant on Post had only 4 people inside, and they weren't Asian.  You win, Doobu.\n\nThere were a few other groups in the restaurant (note, this place is not good for parties of more than 4), and there was one booth left.  We sat, and the waitress, a very nice Korean girl, brought us our menus.  I decided on the beef bibimbap (they didn't have kimchee fried rice) and Boyfriend had the spicy pork, which came with rice.\n\nThe small plates that came out before the meal were hit or miss.  The fried fish (my FAVORITE), seaweed salad and the fishcakes were good.  The others (soybean sprouts, kimchi, some other pickled cabbage) lacked flavor in general.  The waitress accidentally gave us another egg, and we were confused until she brought out our orders and took the egg back.  Who does that?  I could've used an extra egg!\n\nMy bibimbap was in a smaller pot (and more expensive) than the ones I've had in LA or elsewhere, but the stone pot was super hot and kept the rice, beef and veggies piping hot throughout the entire time I was eating.  I liked that the beef wasn't marinated sweet like in others that I've had, but I didn't like how they just cracked the egg into the bowl and didn't fry it first before putting it in.  I know it cooks rapidly because it's so hot, but I'd rather just break up the already-fried egg myself so my chopsticks don't dig into the raw egg yolk.\n\nBoyfriend didn't really enjoy his spicy pork because he said it wasn't enough meat, too many veggies and it wasn't spicy.  I didn't try any because I don't like pork (except bacon and ham), but the meat itself didn't look bad.\n\nWhen I was almost done with my meal, I looked up on the wall and saw a few small flies posting up on the artwork.  It might've been from the heat wave that we had, but ..it kind of killed my desire to finish eating (I ate the whole bowl anyway).  I'm just glad I saw that after I finished eating, not before.

Not quite on the level of My Tofu House for me taste wise, but you can't beat the lack of a serious wait.  Been here a number of times now, and I think we only had to wait for a table twice, and neither of those times was the wait longer than 5-10 mins.  The servers are all really friendly, and are certainly hard workers.  Typically there are only two working on shift, so while things can slow down from time to time, it's hard to blame them when there's a full house.\n\nTheir soon doobu (tofu soup) tastes pretty good, but has a thinner consistency than My Tofu House.  There's some definite kick as you move up the spiciness scale, so those with a weak stomach have been warned.  There's plenty of good stuff loaded in, but not too much of any one thing, so plus points on the balance there.  Also, the variety of soups is pretty decent, ranging from the usual suspects to more unique ones like ham and cheese and corned beef.\n\nOne tweak compared to most tofu soup places is that you get a bowl of purple-ish rice...some sort of red bean or taro rice?  Either way, it's better than the usual white rice just for something different.

Before placing our orders I used the restroom to wash my hands. The ladies' room was small but very clean and no funky smells. From looking at the menu, I was torn between the meat dishes and the tofu dishes. Later I found out you can ask them to mix the meat with the tofu. I decided on the Tofu Bibimbap. As the menu reads, the tofu is served with mixed vegetables and egg yolk over rice in a sizzling stone pot. My friends ordered the Fried Tofu Salad and the Haemul Pajun (assorted seafood & green onion mixed pancake in sizzling stone plate). As we waited for our meals, an array of appetizers were brought out as a part of the meal. Among the offerings were kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, rice noodles and what my friend called \"fat noodles\". Everything was just as it should be.

The seaweed salad had a very natural taste compared to the kind of seaweed salad I've had at Japanese restaurants.

As I write this the morning after, my tongue is still a little sensitive trying to recover some lost taste buds. Bibimbap is a fun dish because you get to play with it somewhat while you stir the egg yolk and watch it cook. You also need to make sure you stir enough so the rice doesn't burn and stick to the bottom of the bowl. It's ok to let some of the rice get crispy though. The crispy rice adds a delicious flavor and nice texture to the dish. I added spicy sauce to my dish and stirred it in until I just had to taste it. The food was too hot but I chewed slowly and drank some water after. Everything just melted together and filled my mouth with a wonderful savory comfort I should feel guilty about. I let my tongue cool down a bit and tried the Fried tofu salad my friend ordered. The salad was a pretty basic mixture of lettuce and carrots, cucumbers and onions. The dressing is really tasty and the fried tofu was a little crunchy on the outside and firm on the inside and didn't feel greasy at all. Before returning to my bibimbap, I also tried my other friend's haemul pajun. It was also hot but it had cooled enough by that point so as not to cause any more damage on my tongue.

Taking this into consideration, and the desire to give a proper review, I decided to order the dessert. Mochi Ice Cream is the only dessert option but you can choose from green tea, strawberry, mango and vanilla. They were out of green tea last night and I ordered the mango and my friend ordered the strawberry. The presentation is cute and simple with the single mochi ball on a small plate drizzled in strawberry syrup. The mochi ball tasted good although I'm sure someone in the back just opened a package anyone can find at the grocery store. I did appreciate the presentation and that it wasn't overpriced. In fact, nothing seemed overpriced at all. I felt the portions were appropriate and was actually surprised that the whole meal for the three of us was just $41.00.

Fried fish, and a large selection of small dishes flanked our main course. We were starving, so were very grateful for the large portions as we sang them praise back and forth.\n\nSadly, once our hunger started to be sated, we noted that some of the food could have been better as the praise started to diminish. We ordered a steak dish, but really it was almost more of a ground beef and quite greasy as well. The fried fish was also not too great either.\n\nWhat was amazing was the tofu, though. Although listed as \"Doobu\" here, most of the menu seemed to mention the place as \"Doobu Tofu\" and its easy to see why. We hadn't been a fan of tofu prior, but upon trying their extremely good fried tofu salad we have grown a new leaf and will probably be trying more tofu in the future.\n\nSo in the end, come for the tofu... but stay away from the meat, at least from what we tried and came to the conclusion of on a less hungry stomach.

When I mentioned to my friends that I had been craving fried tofu they suggested we have dinner at DooBu Korean BBQ & Tofu Restaurant. We got there at around 7 PM. and there were a few other people having dinner, but the place felt empty. The space is small but quaint. There are colorful geometric paintings on the walls that brighten up the place. Our server/waiter was really nice and polite. He was smiling the whole time. Before placing our orders I used the restroom to wash my hands. The ladies' room was small but very clean and no funky smells. From looking at the menu, I was torn between the meat dishes and the tofu dishes. Later I found out you can ask them to mix the meat with the tofu. I decided on the Tofu Bibimbap. As the menu reads, the tofu is served with mixed vegetables and egg yolk over rice in a sizzling stone pot. My friends ordered the Fried Tofu Salad and the Haemul Pajun (assorted seafood & green onion mixed pancake in sizzling stone plate). As we waited for our meals, an array of appetizers were brought out as a part of the meal. Among the offerings were kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, rice noodles and what my friend called \"fat noodles\". Everything was just as it should be. I particularly enjoyed the seaweed salad and the rice noodles. The noodles were delicate and had a hint of garlic. The seaweed salad had a very natural taste compared to the kind of seaweed salad I've had at Japanese restaurants. Before I had had a chance to try all of the appetizers, our meal had arrived at the table. The sizzling hot pot is such a tease. I couldn't wait to dig in but it was definitely too hot! As I write this the morning after, my tongue is still a little sensitive trying to recover some lost taste buds. Bibimbap is a fun dish because you get to play with it somewhat while you stir the egg yolk and watch it cook. You also need to make sure you stir enough so the rice doesn't burn and stick to the bottom of the bowl. It's ok to let some of the rice get crispy though. The crispy rice adds a delicious flavor and nice texture to the dish. I added spicy sauce to my dish and stirred it in until I just had to taste it. The food was too hot but I chewed slowly and drank some water after. Everything just melted together and filled my mouth with a wonderful savory comfort I should feel guilty about. I let my tongue cool down a bit and tried the Fried tofu salad my friend ordered. The salad was a pretty basic mixture of lettuce and carrots, cucumbers and onions. The dressing is really tasty and the fried tofu was a little crunchy on the outside and firm on the inside and didn't feel greasy at all. Before returning to my bibimbap, I also tried my other friend's haemul pajun. It was also hot but it had cooled enough by that point so as not to cause any more damage on my tongue. This dish was a delightful mix of pizza and omelet and seafood and noodles. The bottom was slightly crispy from being on the sizzling stone and the middle was just a little gooey from the noodles. The egg held everything together and you could actually eat a slice as you would a pizza. I finished my bibimbap after touring the rest of the dinner plates on the table. Every bite was just as warm and delicious as the last. It was the perfect dish for a cold evening. After the meal I felt satisfied and still retained the light feeling from before the meal began.

The level of spiciness cannot be altered because they premake it, and I did not notice any seafood or beef within the soup despite it being listed as combination. The flavor was similar to that of seafood soft tofu soup, not unpleasant, but a little bland. The spiciness had a kick to it, but it wasn't unbearable. \n\nGalbi (lunch special portion):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/doobu-san-francisco?select=CoCYbh9-xgv7W1kOUnRLtg#X77erU_M0KGo-inviLx-sw)\nThis was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. I got the lunch special with galbi, marinated beef short ribs. The marinade was pretty good, although a little too sweet. The grill on the ribs was good, and the meat was chewy yet tender. The pieces were a bit on the fatty side though, especially near the bone.\n\nOverall, this place wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd return specifically.

Doobu Tofu closes at 9:30 PM on Sundays, and as most restaurants are very accommodating to folks who are already dining in I've always had this quirk where I just feel bad about staying past the closing time at any restaurant.  I sat down inside the restaurant at 9:05 PM.  After a quick glance of the menu I was ready.  The waitress took my food and drink order immediately.\n\nAt 9:10 PM I had several plates of banchan, a whole fried fish and a raw egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WyBN8MGM6LVuDNBD4cBEqA?select=90y2c9jVK14IegWZsCPqZA) in front of me.  I loved the fried fish and appreciated that the bones were easy to locate and remove.  The glass noodles and the bean curd strips were probably my favorites, but I enjoyed all of the banchan dishes.\n\nMy Shrimp Soon Tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WyBN8MGM6LVuDNBD4cBEqA?select=QCh9co8rl3jPrCSuwtlMHw) arrived around 9:13 PM.  This was my first experience with Korean tofu soup.  I ordered it mild and the spicyness was pretty mild, but I loved this.  It was served in a miniature stone pot so as much as I wanted it to cool down fast so I could just guzzle it I just couldn't because it stayed hot throughout my meal.  I loved the big blocks of soft tofu and the soup had lots of little head attached, soft shelled shrimp.  I wasn't sure if my system could digest the shrimp heads and legs otherwise I might've eaten them whole.  It was kind of a chore removing what little meat was in those little shrimp.  The broth was very flavorful even though I forgot to crack the raw egg into it.\n\nImmediately after the Soon Tofu arrived I got the Bulgogi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WyBN8MGM6LVuDNBD4cBEqA?select=lAMGCrTrpzap76DK-eVjdA) served on a stone platter and a bowl of rice.  I forgot to ask the waitress, but the rice was very interesting.  It had a purple-like hue to it, but it tasted fine.  The Bulgogi was delicious.  The beef was shaved thin and cooked very tender.  The vegetables, mainly onions, peppers, zucchini and carrots, were also cooked tender but not soft.  I had no problem finishing everything except for the raw egg.\n\nIn my eating flurry the waitress did stop by to check up on me, and when she started to clean up different areas of the restaurant I picked up the pace.

As a Korean I feel compelled to give some credible review so all of you non's know what's up.\n\nThat said, I may be 1st generation but I'm no Korean food conoisseur so I grilled my mom on her opinions for this Yelp review. I think she was a little perplexed as to why I suddenly cared so much about Korean food tonight. (It's not my favorite cuisine. There. I said it.)\n\nDue to the proximity of J-town to my current abode we walked over there and checked out Seoul Garden's menu. Mom's reaction to the prices: \"Are you fucking kidding me???\" Actually she was a bit more demure than that and it was also in Korean, but it was the Mama Han equivalent to Hell to the Motherfucking No. So we wandered across the street and Doobu caught my eye.\n\nStarter: A whole fried fish. I've never had this before at a Korean restaurant, but ok, cool. I'm down with some complimentary food. Except it was a whole fried fish that kept LOOKING AT ME and I wasn't keen on picking out the bones. Yes, I had my mom do it. It was... meh. It's pretty much just salted fish that's been fried in some batter.\n\nBanchan (the little side dishes that always come with a Korean meal): Mom says, \"That's it? They give you so much more in the East Bay.\" The cucumber kimchi and cabbage kimchi were a bit too marinated and had been \"sitting too long\" for my taste. It's hard to explain but you can serve kimchi too soon before it's ready, this was on the other end of the spectrum. The portions of the other three (bean sprouts, fish cake and spinach) were small. Sadness.\n\nSpicy Seafood Doobu (Spicy, tofu, seafood. Exactly what the name says): Yay it was actually spicy! Mom said it was not bad, but then she also informed me that it had MSG. \"How do you know?\" \"You can just tell.\" \"But how do you KNOW?? Can you taste it??\" (I'm totally thinking my mom has some weird superpower to detect MSG in food.) \"Look it's thick and if you made this at home, you'd never add it so it wouldn't look quite like this. And most restaurants just DO.\" (Superhero Mom fantasy deflated.)\n\nBeef bibimbap (beef mixed with rice, egg, and other veggies in a hot stone bowl): This was inneresting. Instead of using bulgogi that typically comes in this dish, ground beef is used and marinated in the same stuff as bulgogi. There was quite a lot of meat and not as much veggies as I'm used to. It was not bad, just different from what I'm used to for bibimbap. Mama Han says, \"This is ok, just different. But that's a small portion for $12. I could make this way better.\" Bitchslap, Doobu. And yes, my mom's cooking is the shit.\n\nRandom: They played Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You\". Made me misty-eyed for the 90's and middle school dances.\n\nMama Han's conclusion: For better Korean food go to the South Bay.\n\nMy conclusion: For the best Korean food have mom's home cooking. \n\n(If I had gone by myself and I didn't know any better this would've been a 3-star review, but tonight I'm putting myself in my mom's size 6 shoes.

Every single time we get food.  Poor guy.\n\nIt is very rare that I get a craving for Korean food up here in San Francisco.  I've mentioned before that the best Korean food is back down in LA, and since I go there once every few months, I get my fill.  However, I really wanted either a bibimbap or kimchee fried rice, and that craving was beating up the ramen craving that I had right before I parked in Japantown.\n\nSo, we ended up at Doobu after I remembered a few recent 4-star reviews from fellow Yelpers Wilhelm Y. and Mike L.  Good sign.  Plus, the other Korean restaurant on Post had only 4 people inside, and they weren't Asian.  You win, Doobu.\n\nThere were a few other groups in the restaurant (note, this place is not good for parties of more than 4), and there was one booth left.  We sat, and the waitress, a very nice Korean girl, brought us our menus.  I decided on the beef bibimbap (they didn't have kimchee fried rice) and Boyfriend had the spicy pork, which came with rice.\n\nThe small plates that came out before the meal were hit or miss.  The fried fish (my FAVORITE), seaweed salad and the fishcakes were good.  The others (soybean sprouts, kimchi, some other pickled cabbage) lacked flavor in general.  The waitress accidentally gave us another egg, and we were confused until she brought out our orders and took the egg back.  Who does that?  I could've used an extra egg!\n\nMy bibimbap was in a smaller pot (and more expensive) than the ones I've had in LA or elsewhere, but the stone pot was super hot and kept the rice, beef and veggies piping hot throughout the entire time I was eating.  I liked that the beef wasn't marinated sweet like in others that I've had, but I didn't like how they just cracked the egg into the bowl and didn't fry it first before putting it in.  I know it cooks rapidly because it's so hot, but I'd rather just break up the already-fried egg myself so my chopsticks don't dig into the raw egg yolk.\n\nBoyfriend didn't really enjoy his spicy pork because he said it wasn't enough meat, too many veggies and it wasn't spicy.  I didn't try any because I don't like pork (except bacon and ham), but the meat itself didn't look bad.\n\nWhen I was almost done with my meal, I looked up on the wall and saw a few small flies posting up on the artwork.  It might've been from the heat wave that we had, but ..it kind of killed my desire to finish eating (I ate the whole bowl anyway).  I'm just glad I saw that after I finished eating, not before.  Hopefully this isn't a recurring problem?\n\nBoyfriend gave this place 3 stars, I gave it 3.5 because of the flies and decent food.

But then again, maybe that was a good thing, so I had something to distract me as the soon dubu, as always, came out hot enough to cook a raw egg. which is a good thing, because it comes out with a raw in-the-shell egg beside it. as always, I broke the egg into the stew immediately so it would cook. \n\nIn the meantime, I dug into the panchan. It was much better than I remember it being in the past. Not that it was bad in the past, but this time it was excellent: seaweed, kimchi, fish cake shreds, spicy cukes, and one more but I forget. And a whole small deep-fried fish which was just okay but not bad. \n\nWarning to vegetarians, if you order the vegetarian soon tofu they still automatically send out the fish, the fish cake and the egg, so if you don't want these you need to say so.\n\nbut that mandu soon dubu was super delicious, including several decent-sized tasty dumplings, soft rice cakes (similar to Chinese nien gou), and lots of chunks of soft tofu swimming in a yummy, on the spicy side of medium, broth.\n\nsome pink rice on the side\n\nToo bad I ran out of stomach room before hitting\nthe bottom of the bowl.\n\nSoon doobu.\nThe sooner the better.\n\nRemember that phrase.\n\nOn the very low side of moderate.

When I mentioned to my friends that I had been craving fried tofu they suggested we have dinner at DooBu Korean BBQ & Tofu Restaurant. We got there at around 7 PM. and there were a few other people having dinner, but the place felt empty. The space is small but quaint. There are colorful geometric paintings on the walls that brighten up the place. Our server/waiter was really nice and polite. He was smiling the whole time. Before placing our orders I used the restroom to wash my hands. The ladies' room was small but very clean and no funky smells. From looking at the menu, I was torn between the meat dishes and the tofu dishes. Later I found out you can ask them to mix the meat with the tofu. I decided on the Tofu Bibimbap. As the menu reads, the tofu is served with mixed vegetables and egg yolk over rice in a sizzling stone pot. My friends ordered the Fried Tofu Salad and the Haemul Pajun (assorted seafood & green onion mixed pancake in sizzling stone plate). As we waited for our meals, an array of appetizers were brought out as a part of the meal. Among the offerings were kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, rice noodles and what my friend called \"fat noodles\". Everything was just as it should be. I particularly enjoyed the seaweed salad and the rice noodles. The noodles were delicate and had a hint of garlic. The seaweed salad had a very natural taste compared to the kind of seaweed salad I've had at Japanese restaurants. Before I had had a chance to try all of the appetizers, our meal had arrived at the table. The sizzling hot pot is such a tease. I couldn't wait to dig in but it was definitely too hot! As I write this the morning after, my tongue is still a little sensitive trying to recover some lost taste buds. Bibimbap is a fun dish because you get to play with it somewhat while you stir the egg yolk and watch it cook. You also need to make sure you stir enough so the rice doesn't burn and stick to the bottom of the bowl. It's ok to let some of the rice get crispy though. The crispy rice adds a delicious flavor and nice texture to the dish. I added spicy sauce to my dish and stirred it in until I just had to taste it. The food was too hot but I chewed slowly and drank some water after. Everything just melted together and filled my mouth with a wonderful savory comfort I should feel guilty about. I let my tongue cool down a bit and tried the Fried tofu salad my friend ordered. The salad was a pretty basic mixture of lettuce and carrots, cucumbers and onions. The dressing is really tasty and the fried tofu was a little crunchy on the outside and firm on the inside and didn't feel greasy at all. Before returning to my bibimbap, I also tried my other friend's haemul pajun. It was also hot but it had cooled enough by that point so as not to cause any more damage on my tongue. This dish was a delightful mix of pizza and omelet and seafood and noodles. The bottom was slightly crispy from being on the sizzling stone and the middle was just a little gooey from the noodles. The egg held everything together and you could actually eat a slice as you would a pizza. I finished my bibimbap after touring the rest of the dinner plates on the table. Every bite was just as warm and delicious as the last. It was the perfect dish for a cold evening. After the meal I felt satisfied and still retained the light feeling from before the meal began. Taking this into consideration, and the desire to give a proper review, I decided to order the dessert. Mochi Ice Cream is the only dessert option but you can choose from green tea, strawberry, mango and vanilla. They were out of green tea last night and I ordered the mango and my friend ordered the strawberry. The presentation is cute and simple with the single mochi ball on a small plate drizzled in strawberry syrup. The mochi ball tasted good although I'm sure someone in the back just opened a package anyone can find at the grocery store. I did appreciate the presentation and that it wasn't overpriced. In fact, nothing seemed overpriced at all. I felt the portions were appropriate and was actually surprised that the whole meal for the three of us was just $41.00. Overall I enjoyed the meal and I am truly a fan now.
