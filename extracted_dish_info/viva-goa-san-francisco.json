We sauntered in here one evening on our way back from Marin on a freezing cold day when we were craving hot, homely goodness.\n\nAh, chai and Indian coffee to the rescue! Even better with fresh vegetable pakoras! Amazing start to the meal.\n\nFor the main course, we decided to stick with Goan specialties, being in a Goan restaurant. We ordered the fish curry and the chicken xacuti, accompanied with plain naan. The fish curry was slightly bland for my taste and the curry element slightly thinned-out and translucent. I'm not sure if that is the intended preparation, but it definitely could've used a tad bit more masala. Overall though, the fish was fresh and didn't leave an aftertaste. The chicken xacuti was plenty flavorful. Similar to a standard Indian chicken curry, it included a few nontraditional spices.\n\nOverall, a nice place to dine and friendly customer service.

I am from Mangalore, which is an Indian city not too far from Goa, and both these places have a LOT of common elements in their cuisines. I was extremely happy to find this place reviewed so highly on Yelp! and convinced my fiance to take me there when I was visiting last weekend. We tried the following dishes from their menu:\n\nFish cutlets - These were decent; there were 2 big patty portions coated with semolina (rava) which gave them that extra crunch. I wish they served them with some other condiment than plain old tomato ketchup!\n\nPrawn Xacuti with rice - My Goan friend in Chicago made chicken xacuti the other day and it was SOOOO GOOD, I can almost smell and taste the curry in my head!! Unfortunately, Viva Goa's offering was a terrible let down. The xacuti masala didn't seem fresh at all. The dish felt like it was just stored away in the freezer, taken out, reheated and served to us.\n\nSeafood Biryani - The rice grains were well cooked and long. I think the seafood consisted of calamari, scallops and crab meat (or was it fish? I don't remember). This dish was passable but nothing to brag about.\n\nPork Vindaloo - This one fared the worst! We ordered this after making sure that there were no big pieces of pork fat in the gravy. The gravy looked like something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant - red, soupy, thick. It tasted horrid and I felt like there was tomato ketchup mixed in it. The Goan \"vindaloo\" is very similar to the Mangalorean \"indaad\". This dish did not come anywhere close to what I have been eating all this while in India.\n\nBebinca - My favorite Goan sweet of all times! I had to have this for dessert. What they served us was 4 decent sized pieces. The bebinca was a bit dense but this could probably be because it was not freshly made (the cooking process is quite long and tedious) and was stored in the refrigerator. I still enjoyed the dish!\n\nAll in all, this experience was a disappointment!

I wish they served them with some other condiment than plain old tomato ketchup!\n\nPrawn Xacuti with rice - My Goan friend in Chicago made chicken xacuti the other day and it was SOOOO GOOD, I can almost smell and taste the curry in my head!! Unfortunately, Viva Goa's offering was a terrible let down. The xacuti masala didn't seem fresh at all. The dish felt like it was just stored away in the freezer, taken out, reheated and served to us.\n\nSeafood Biryani - The rice grains were well cooked and long. I think the seafood consisted of calamari, scallops and crab meat (or was it fish? I don't remember). This dish was passable but nothing to brag about.\n\nPork Vindaloo - This one fared the worst! We ordered this after making sure that there were no big pieces of pork fat in the gravy. The gravy looked like something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant - red, soupy, thick. It tasted horrid and I felt like there was tomato ketchup mixed in it. The Goan \"vindaloo\" is very similar to the Mangalorean \"indaad\". This dish did not come anywhere close to what I have been eating all this while in India.\n\nBebinca - My favorite Goan sweet of all times! I had to have this for dessert. What they served us was 4 decent sized pieces. The bebinca was a bit dense but this could probably be because it was not freshly made (the cooking process is quite long and tedious) and was stored in the refrigerator. I still enjoyed the dish!\n\nAll in all, this experience was a disappointment!

Unfortunately, Viva Goa's offering was a terrible let down. The xacuti masala didn't seem fresh at all. The dish felt like it was just stored away in the freezer, taken out, reheated and served to us.\n\nSeafood Biryani - The rice grains were well cooked and long. I think the seafood consisted of calamari, scallops and crab meat (or was it fish? I don't remember). This dish was passable but nothing to brag about.\n\nPork Vindaloo - This one fared the worst! We ordered this after making sure that there were no big pieces of pork fat in the gravy. The gravy looked like something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant - red, soupy, thick. It tasted horrid and I felt like there was tomato ketchup mixed in it. The Goan \"vindaloo\" is very similar to the Mangalorean \"indaad\". This dish did not come anywhere close to what I have been eating all this while in India.\n\nBebinca - My favorite Goan sweet of all times! I had to have this for dessert. What they served us was 4 decent sized pieces. The bebinca was a bit dense but this could probably be because it was not freshly made (the cooking process is quite long and tedious) and was stored in the refrigerator.

Time for my feast.\n\nA bread basket of Aloo Paratha looked fried to the deep crisp.  The first piece of naan bread tasted crispy on the outside with rich chunky potatoes on the inside.  Tasted so good with and without the Goan spices, I couldn't stop wolfing all the pieces, until I came to the point of slowing down.\n\nThen I got to the Vegetable Caldin.  I wasn't fooled by its small size.  I knew there's more vegetables on the bottom with green herbs on the top.  And the yellow part that dominate the entire bowl, could be squash or turmeric with hints of coconut water.  With cumin, coriander, and the Goan spices, made a very warm bowl altogether.\n\nI know I couldn't easily finished the Basmati Rice.  I only finished some of its lengthy whites and all the green peas.  Raita was the last one I finished.  Taste like yogurt dip with strips of carrots and cucumbers.

Through our foodie adventures, I have developed quite an obsession with the cuisines of this region. When I discovered the existence of Viva Goa, I was determined to make the several-mile trek up to the Marina because it had been ages since I'd had Goan food (and I've gotten kind of sick of the same old Westernized North Indian dishes).\n\nMy friend and I came here for lunch. She opted for the lunch buffet, but I decided to go a la carte because the buffet only had 2 Goan dishes (both of which weren't terribly exciting) and I wanted something authentically and uniquely Goan that I wouldn't be able to find at other Indian restaurants. \n\nAfter some consultation with the very friendly Goan owner, I chose the Prawn Xacutti. If you only have room in your brain to remember one Goan dish, let it be Xacutti, the definitive curry of Goa. It differs from other curries by having poppy seeds as part of its flavoring. I chose the prawn version because Goa, which is right on the coast, is famous for its wide variety of seafood dishes (particularly fish and shellfish). The xacutti was thick and tasty, with a complex multi-layered variety of spices, and the prawns were large, succulent and perfectly cooked. Combined with a generous portion of basmati rice and freshly baked, piping hot naan, and this meal could have easily fed two. \n\nI also tried some of my friend's Goan Fish Curry (one of the two Goan dishes at the buffet). The fish (some kind of white fish) was very tender, reminiscent of the way Chinese people cook fish, but the curry was rather watery and the flavors seemed diluted. For dessert, my friend and I split the Bebinca, a traditional Goan dessert made with flour, sugar, ghee and coconut milk (which gives it most of its flavor). Bebinca reminds me a lot of Chinese Thousand-Layered Cake, my favorite dim sum sweet. Both desserts are traditionally baked in layers. Viva Goa's Bebinca was very thick, with an almost paste-like consistency, and had the delicious flavor of coconut mixed with caramel. It was served with whipped cream.

I am from Mangalore, which is an Indian city not too far from Goa, and both these places have a LOT of common elements in their cuisines. I was extremely happy to find this place reviewed so highly on Yelp! and convinced my fiance to take me there when I was visiting last weekend. We tried the following dishes from their menu:\n\nFish cutlets - These were decent; there were 2 big patty portions coated with semolina (rava) which gave them that extra crunch. I wish they served them with some other condiment than plain old tomato ketchup!\n\nPrawn Xacuti with rice - My Goan friend in Chicago made chicken xacuti the other day and it was SOOOO GOOD, I can almost smell and taste the curry in my head!! Unfortunately, Viva Goa's offering was a terrible let down. The xacuti masala didn't seem fresh at all. The dish felt like it was just stored away in the freezer, taken out, reheated and served to us.\n\nSeafood Biryani - The rice grains were well cooked and long. I think the seafood consisted of calamari, scallops and crab meat (or was it fish? I don't remember). This dish was passable but nothing to brag about.\n\nPork Vindaloo - This one fared the worst! We ordered this after making sure that there were no big pieces of pork fat in the gravy. The gravy looked like something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant - red, soupy, thick. It tasted horrid and I felt like there was tomato ketchup mixed in it. The Goan \"vindaloo\" is very similar to the Mangalorean \"indaad\". This dish did not come anywhere close to what I have been eating all this while in India.\n\nBebinca - My favorite Goan sweet of all times! I had to have this for dessert. What they served us was 4 decent sized pieces. The bebinca was a bit dense but this could probably be because it was not freshly made (the cooking process is quite long and tedious) and was stored in the refrigerator.
