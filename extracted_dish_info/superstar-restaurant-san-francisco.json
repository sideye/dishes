It was a weekday and my brother-in-law picked us up at the airport at 9am as we caught the first flight out to SF.  BIL asks if we want to go to brunch, \"there's this whole-in-the-wall place that I go to all the time, its CHEAP and its really good too!\" He's saying all the right things and of course, we're in, plus this gives us quality time to spend with him before he drops us off at his house to run errands.\n\nBecause of the time of day, we make it from the airport to the restaurant in 15-minutes.  Street parking is the only option as this is a neighborhood joint. People walk from their homes, school and nearby businesses to feast here.  Because this is BIL's frequent stop, we park at the Safeway across the street and like city folk, we jay-walk.\n\nSo we walk in and I look up at the menu and exclaimed how cheap it was as the lunch special beef broccoli was only $3.75! So my BIL was like, no you can't order from there, order from here and points to the menu on the front window of the counter. Which was still a good deal. I opted for the longanisa plate at $3.75 while my BIL got bangus (fish) and my husband got the tilapia plates.  Including, coffee, our bill was $17.  Cash is king here.\n\nService was quick.  My husband went to the market next door to check it out and in less than 2-minutes, our meals were delivered. And the food was good too. I've never had a sliced tomato with longanisa before. Of course my BIL enjoyed his meal as he orders it all the time and my husband did a great job of digging into the tilapia as they serve the entire fish.\n\nBut I still wondered why I couldn't order from the menu up above.  My BIL says that the menu has been hanging there for the past 30-years and through the different owners. They just haven't taken it down or removed any of the menu items or the prices. It's quirky but makes for a good story.\n\nMy BIL told us that this place gets busy at lunch because the high school kids at the school nearby come here for lunch.  And sure enough, 10:30 am, 8 people came in all at the same time.  The restaurant is small, so the 8th person in line stood at the very entrance of the restaurant.  If a 9th person came, they would be standing in line outside the entrance.\n\nThe city in the older suburb areas has many of these type of restaurants. This certainly made for a great start to this visit to SF.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-06-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered the pork chops Hong Kong style, added longanisa, and got it with tomatoes and pineapples.
