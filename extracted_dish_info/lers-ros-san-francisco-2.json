Tonight was my fourth visit here within six months. Last two visits were with larger groups, so I definitely had a chance twice to try a large variety of their dishes. I feel I'm \"supposed\"to like it, because of all the hype and restaurant-generated pr that they definitely excel at. Every single time, though, I left wondering if it was me who ordered the wrong dishes, or if I was just missing something. It wasn't me. This place knows how to pump up the pr, but little else. \n\nFood - Many dishes were pretty salty, like the frog and their red curry dishes. Eel was cut into super tiny pieces and were small and bony to get any meat off the eels. Fail. Other places have way more meaty slices. Total waste. roast duck was mostly a soggy glob of fat.\n Tried both the chicken and pork pad see yuck (yes, I mean yuck). Strange, the pork one was super salty and the chicken one was bland, but both had mushy flat noodles. These rice noodles can be difficult to cook, especially if they're not super fresh. I suspect the latter is true.  Clearly, not much effort is made into presentation either, as many of their dishes were accompanied with the same sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and cilantro garnish.\n\n DIshes I did like were the deep fried tofu and the deep fried crab ball-like appetizer.\n\nService was certainly no stand out. Seems that you need to ask for any and all water refills. Our waitress was polite, but really wasn't able to sufficiently address questions I had about some dishes I was contemplating between. I sensed a language barrier, on her part.\n\nNothing special at all about the ambiance inside, but...\n\nTOURISTS BEWARE:\nNow the ambiance outside, well, anyone coming here needs to know it's really a sketchy hood that has gotten even worst in recent years. If you don't mind walking by people who are shooting up, drugged out, drunk, in need of serious mental health services, or are asleep on the ground propped up against the wall, then you should be fine. And you need to be ok with the more than normal San Francisco stench of urine all over. If that's hip for you, go at it. Not for me. The food, service and atmosphere is so not worth that! And of course, don't forget the higher than normal rate of car break-ins here in the Tenderloin. Knowing all this in advance, I Ubered here.\n\nGave it more than a fair chance.

Everyone arrived promptly and we were seated at the center table which was vertically arranged that stretched from the kitchen door all the way to the front entrance. With seating arranged by the level of spiciness, I had the pleasure of surrounding myself with Toni, Alan, Manabu and Shannon. \n\nBy studying the menu in advance, we were able to order 20 family style dishes with many that were doubled to feed the size of our group. To name a few highlights, I enjoyed the Chicken Satay, Thai Herb Sausage, Fried Spare Ribs, Pork Belly, and Ginger with Chicken, Sliced Tender Beef with Young Peppercorn and Galingale, and chunky Frog with Basil Leaves. My absolute favorites were the spicy fried Tilapia and tender Sea Bass where the meat fell off the bones ever so beautifully. The Red and Green Curries and Curry Puffs that looked like samosas were really outstanding too.\n\nThe dishes that I thought needed improvements were the Green Papaya Salad with Raw Crabs and the Spicy and Sour Seafood Soup which was too sour for me. The Beef Tendon Stew was not a good choice as it was difficult to share, and I thought the Eggplant was decent but not the best I've had. I didn't have a chance to sample the Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew but they looked pretty good too. Several people had complained about the clams, but otherwise people were super full by the end of the meal. My side dish of prik nam pla was powerful as I always appreciate the chance to boost my level of spiciness up another notch. \n\nService was a bit inconsistent throughout the meal. They were a bit understaffed and the wait time between each dish was filled with gaps here and there. On the other hand, I also appreciated the fact that they went out of their way to buy crabs from the market in the morning just so we could have it, and they were extremely generous for not charging us a mandatory gratuity and cake cutting fee in the end. They went above and beyond to serve us by keeping our fresh cherries and saint honore cake refrigerated, and without asking they provided us fresh plate settings whenever it was needed--including dessert which we didn't order from them. In the end we had the chance to get out of our seats to mingle with each other, and this also allowed us to take over the entire restaurant with plenty of room to roam. The restaurant was also airing the World Cup at the time which further added to the festivity as people reacted to the different phases of the game.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect meal by any stretch of the imagination. I think their evening chef might be better but I also believe we couldn't ask for better service given the size of our group. In the end we each paid $27 including tax and gratuity--not bad considering the range of dishes we were able to cover throughout the meal. I'm very thankful for all the Yelpers who attended the event, and for Jonathan W's fresh picked Brentwood cherries and Manabu M's invitation to hang out at the rooftop of his home to overlook the skyline afterwards.

I wasn't impressed by the garlic rabbit or the spicy noodle, but I shall return!\n\nThe Tale of the Girl Who Dined with Peter Rabbit Before a Giants Game:\nAfter watching, Check Please! Bay Area, I had to check this place out. Boyfriend and I got off Civic Center and walked over and arrived at 4:50pm on a Tuesday. \n\nWe ordered the house special, Garlic Rabbit and Spicy Noodle. We also tried out one of the recommendations from a Check Please! reviewer: Thai Herb Sausage.\n\nI appreciated that the food came out in good time.\n\nThe sausage was definitely the highlight of the meal. I liked eating the sausage with the dainty slices of chili pepper, mixed with some cilantro, peanuts, and ginger. It was spicy! The small pieces of lime helped quell my self-induced, tongue-burns, however as dainty as the lime slices were, it was kind of annoying how small they were, and they were difficult to hold onto while peeling the lime flesh with my enormous teeth. Maybe I should have just popped them in my mouth. I might have misjudged the significance of dining etiquette. \n\nBoyfriend was quiet throughout dinner, thinking about the Thai Iced Tea that never came. \n\nNext we had the spicy noodle, which maybe after the awesomeness of the Herb Sausage didn't really compare. We were looking for something new and interesting. Spicy noodle wasn't that interesting. It had a few bits of red bell pepper. \n\nSimultaneously, we had the Garlic Rabbit. It tasted like chicken. I've had a similar Filipino chicken dish. Small pieces of chicken deep fried golden. And just like in the Filipino dish, there were small bits of bone shards once every 6 pieces. I was eating the meat carefully, because I didn't want to eat bones. I had to carefully eat around the bones, even though they easily could have chewed. Eating the small bits of rabbit took a long time. Can bone shards cut your GI epithelia? **\n\nIn fact, after one minute of waiting to see if the waitress would look over to figure out we wanted our check, I walked straight up to the lot of them huddling in a circle and held out my card. Then, we sped walked to AT&T park to get our free snow globes. Almost missed the snow globes by 10 minutes(I watched from above timing it). And exactly at bottom of the 6th inning, I finally dislodged the last of the rabbit bone shards from my teeth.\n\nLike the last two reviews I've posted recently, I would come back! Even rabbit bone shards have not pacified my interest to try out new menu items! (Eating REAL Filipino food emboldens me to try out anything!) I wish more Thai restaurants would offer more interesting things!\n\nAnd like my last review, I'm holding out on my 4- or 5-star rating until I'm really impressed. For the credit of the Garlic Rabbit, if I was at home with my family, watching the game on my couch, I probably would not have minded snacking on Peter Rabbit.\n\n** http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1790837/", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["The Thai Herb Sausage was quite tasty though, a little too spicy for my liking.

"], "author": "Michael H.", "review": "Had a lunch with three others at Lers Ros today.  My mother is Thai so my tastebuds have experienced everything that Thai food can be over the years.  Bottom line: Lers Ros definitely beats anything I've had in the Bay Area so far (excepting not having yet tried Thai House Express), but doesn't quite rise to the level of \"top-notch quality Thai food\" that can be found on rare occasions in this country.  As much as there was subtlety and complexity in the flavors, which were very much authentic, the interplay of spices, heat, and ingredients can be taken to another level or two.  In recent personal experience, Thai Siam in Arrington, VA (hole in the wall place with four tables run by a retired woman who grows most of the ingredients she uses and widely considered the best Thai currently on the East Coast) is dish for dish superior to Lers Ros.  That said, here's a rundown of our impressions of the dishes today - \n\n#27 Tom ka gai - the balance of flavors was about 90% there - chicken quality was high but a bit skimpy on the amount of chicken.  Flavors should have included a bit more intensity in the kaffir lime (and no additional option of adding squeezed lime was provided).  All in all, a fine rendition, but there was one or two layers of flavor disappointingly absent (yet more layers than I've discovered in your run-of-the-mill Thai eatery).  Perhaps it needed more lemongrass?  Or pepper?  Something...\n\n#9 - Kao moo yang - I really enjoyed this dish.  Pork had a subtly smokey flavor to it, but not overwhelming.  Interplayed extremely well with the chili powder sauce.  I appreciated that the intensity of the spiciness was set at just the right level to allow for both the under- and overtones of distinct flavors to come together. \n\n#4 Thai herb sausage - judging by scoop amount, I seemed to like this dish more than others in my party did.  It was a very pleasant rendition of the SE Asian-style sausage, which is one of my favorite Asian products to begin with.  So maybe I have a lower threshold for giving my stamp of approval on this one, but I could find no faults.  Tender, juicy, flavorful, not greasy.  A winner in my book.\n\n#13 - Som Tom - green papaya salad.  hmm - I thought this dish failed just a bit.  Kitchen really went hog wild on the spice level, which in itself is not automatically a criticism.  Problem was that they let spiciness be the one and only star here.  The prawns were flavorless, and the lime dressing seemed strangely diluted.  The dish lacked cohesiveness - all of the flavors were distinct elements and just didn't come together.  \n\n\"Chicken puff\" special: samosas, basically, with a peanut dipping sauce.  The puffs and filling were quite nice - crispy outside without being too crunchy, and soft flavorful filling.  I found the peanut sauce to be lacking, however.  There wasn't enough kick to the sauce, and frankly it reminded me of the \"dumbed down\" version of peanut sauces one finds much too often in Americanized Thai restaurants.  Instead of a goo, in my opinion a peanut sauce that was more granular in nature, and with a brighter flavor to its base, would have provided a better texture combination with the puff filing. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob stir-fried pork with crispy rind and basil leaves. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find the pork to be swimming excessively in sauce, or the sauce to be particularly fatty.  I enjoyed the crispy rind on the pork too - a nice contrast in flavor and texture.  This was a very \"comforting\" dish - but I could see the addition of one or two more flavor undertones would really make this dish come alive more than it did. \n\n#77 Pad See Ew - deliberately chosen to be our \"bread and butter\" dish.  One of ubiquity so as to directly compare a comfort food staple with others.  Verdict: eh.  They really phoned this one in.  I appreciated the use of gai lan as opposed to Western broccoli, but still there was nothing to this dish over that which you can find in any Thai place.  The noodles were somewhat goupy.  Kitchen really didn't do much to accentuate the complexities that this dish, despite being a dark sauce dish, can achieve if you really put some interest into it. \n\n#113 - Quick fried marinated trout with mango sauce - YES SIR!  This was an absolute winner, and is worth the trip in itself.  Definitely the star of the meal.  Perfectly crispy, bones, tail, skin, everything edible.

Let me take you back when this was my go-to Thai place that served up the most amazing Thai-style street food. Having been to Thailand and also being able to speak the language fluently and raised in this culture, I know my Thai food. The food was always consistent with the perfect balance of flavors that highlight the spicy, salty, sweet, and sour that is so characteristic of Thailand's cuisine. \n\nNow, fast forward to the new Lers Ros where it has expanded into the more chic neighborhoods (think Hayes Valley) and gotten lauded by more than one major foodie publications. I get that food prices have increased, and I do not mind paying good money for great food, but I do take issue with paying good money for not-so-great food. \n\nFood: We ordered a smorgasbord of the usual just to see if it would meet our earlier expectations, and I have to say that while I love that extra bit of sour in my dishes, I felt that the chef was having one hell of a day because it was as if she dumped the whole pint of lime juice into the majority of our dishes. You really had to wince as you took each bite, and the funny thing was that the heavy-handed sourness was apparent in nearly all the dishes we ordered. \n\nAppetizers/Salad:\n- Some Tum Koong (Papaya salad with grilled shrimp) - Spicy, but too sour.\n- Koh Moo Yang (Grilled pork shoulder) - Pork was tender, but the portion was definitely not commensurate with the price tag. Also, the chili dipping sauce was way too sour.\n- Larb Phed Yang (Roasted duck salad larb) - Normally, this is my FAVORITE dish on the menu (partially bc this dish essentially put them on the map), but dang, they plucked and squeezed all the limes from one tree into this dish so I could barely eat it.\n\nSoup:\n- Tom Kha Gai (Coconut chicken soup) - Again, way too sour. Normally, the flavors are balanced and I love how they serve it in a fire pot and sprinkle some chili oil on top. \n\nEntrees:\n- Pad See-Ew (Flat Noodle Chow Fun) - This was the ONLY dish that was well balanced and perfectly charred. We actually took this dish home because we loved it so much.\n- Pad Ka-na Moo Krob (Crispy fried 3-layer pork belly with Chinese gailan) - This dish was way too salty as it was prepared that day. Normally, it's also one of the best things on the menu for me since the pork is nice and crispy and the gailan is so fresh. Also, you can ask them to top it with a fried sunny side up egg for the authentic experience.\n\nPrice vs. Value: Our bill came up to $100+ (with tax & tip) for lunch, and it appears that everything on their menu is pegged at an average price point of close to $12. Times have definitely changed; I just wished the consistency of the food had not done the same. If you want to try it for yourself, be my guest. Just don't complain if you have to blink a few times as you take a bite. And then, once more when your bill comes out.\n\nService: The service is great.

It is not a huge restaurant but spacious enough.\n\nFOOD:\nThey offer over 110 dishes to choose from so I am sure you or your picky friend will find and enjoy something. Overwhelming since they have so much choices. Here is what we tried:\n~7x7 BIG EATS 2012 #45: DUCK LARB Les Ros Thai's Duck Larb was good.

"], "author": "Shannon L.", "review": "Lers Ros Thai has been on my bookmarked list for what feels like 5 years and finally I've come to try one of the most authentic Thai restaurants in the Bay Area, so they say.  On a Friday night at around 8pm, the wait was about 15-20 minutes but quickly escalated after that.  Crowds eat late around here.\n\nLarb Phed Yang (duck salad) really shocks your socks as a first dish.  The lime flavor hits you until the spiciness settles into your throat and catches you off guard.  I love that you wrap the duck, red onion, and other bits into small cups of iceberg lettuce because it offsets the flavor with a coolness.\n\nKoh Moo Yang (grilled pork shoulder) is a must get like they all say!  It's a big piece with thin slices; some are lean and some have a 1 cm of fat attached.  I wouldn't expect a tender piece of meat but something that's more smokey and almost veering towards jerky (although not quite).  They really know how to work their sauces here because it was a great balance and not as tart as the salad.\n\nPork belly was a dish I couldn't find on the online menu but on the physical menu at the restaurant, it's number 60-something.  I would say this was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  The pork was roasted Chinese style with an uber crispy skin.  Again, some pieces were tougher than others but I'm thinking that's just how they do things here.  Don't expect the succulent, braised juicy pork belly with the glistening fat you're used to seeing; this is a more raw, homemade version.  Medium spiciness is a good level because you get the spice but that's not all you're thinking about.  Unlike the previous two dishes I mentioned, which were more appetizers, this dish is saucy and goes well with rice.\n\nPla Rad Prik (whole fried tilapia) surprised me that it was on the house specials list. Given that they do not make it generic with bottled chili sauce like other Thai restaurants, it does start tasting similar so I might have scratched this out to get a curry or soup for next time.  Website claims that fresh fish is guaranteed each day but it's hard to tell because it's fried to very well done and I couldn't distinguish the flaky texture of typical fresh fish.\n\nRad Nah (house secret gravy sauce with marinated pork and flat noodle) was another regret.  We wanted a noodle dish to fill us up and balance out the other dishes but this was more of a gravy entree with a small chunk of noodles, lots of veggies, and marinated pork.  Pork seems to be the theme of the night also so by this dish, I was porked out.  BUT...if you're craving rad nah, the gravy is pretty solid and goes well over your rice.\n\nPlaces like these shame generic Thai restaurants.  Like a Chinese person craving Panda Express, I suppose there will be moments where I'll just want a pad thai and the closest joint is good enough for that.  Lers Ros is definitely a special place though and I would gladly take anyone who claims they like Thai food.  We'll see what they know!  Also, service is fantastic.

My friends insisted that this place has amazing food. Considering he is my Northern California food guide, I went with him to indulge. The place is found in the Tenderloin district, which is not the nicest part of the neighborhood. The restaurant was fairly empty since we got there around 6pm, before the big dinner rush. This place is nicer than your average hole in the wall joint, it's clean and it has some flat screens where they are usually playing sports. \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\nKoh Moo Yang\nTom Kha Kai\nKao Na Phed\n\nThe first course was Koh Moo Yang, which is grilled slices of pork shoulder, served with a chili powder sauce. Let me tell you, this dish is very, very tasty. The pork is juicy and is ultra tender. Dipping it in the chili powder sauce adds to the taste. SO GOOD! I would have been happy with just this one dish, but there were two more on the way!\n\nUp next was the Tom Kha Kai, a coconut milk based soup with chicken , lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. One popular Thai dish that I really don't like is Tom Yum Gai, and based on it's standard description of spicy, sour, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf chicken soup, sounds very similar to Tom Kha Kai. I was very skeptical about trying this dish with my severe dislike for Tom Yum Gai, but what the hey, I was on vacation and up for anything. To my surprise, this soup was yummy. It was a mix between a panang curry and tom yum gai, and the combination of the two was deilcious. I forgot to take a picture when it first came out due to it being so tasty so the half eaten shot below was all I could get!\n\nOur last dish of the night was the five spices duck over rice, served with chili and vinegar sauce, or otherwise known as: Kao Na Phed . At this point, I'm stuffed, but I had to make room for at least a bite of this. I only had one piece, but the one piece I had was perfect. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Another dish you just cannot go wrong with. \n\nAll in all, another highly recommended San Francisco gem. Just be careful if you go there after dark, the Tenderloin area is definitely not the safest area!\n\nread more of my reviews at www.thekitchenfloor.com", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-02-24"}, {"excerpts": ["For starters I tried the Larb Phed Yang (roasted duck larb) and the Koh Moo Yang (pork shoulder).

It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient.

"], "author": "Daniel S.", "review": "FINALLY, a Thai place in SF I can really recommend!\n\nA caveat: this is based on a limited selection of dishes, and some heavy recommendations from friends.  However, two of these dishes blew me away.  I just kept saying: \"Wow. Wow. Wow.\"  And this was because they tasted like dishes you would have in Bangkok, at really good places.\n\nSo far I've had 6 dishes:\n\n1) Kha Nah Moo Krob.  Confusingly, they put this on the menu under \"Rice Soup.\"  Unappetizingly, they call it Stir-Fired Pork with Crispy Rind.  But it's awesome -- the fatback pork is freshly fried to perfection, the chinese broccoli (that's the \"kha nah\") is fleshy with perfectly peeled stems, and the sauce is not just seriously umami -- it's also spiced in a way only confident Thai cooks will dare.  My friend says she gets this dish every time she goes, and I can see why.\n\n2) Kao Kha Moo.  Officially, this is whole stewed pig leg on rice, but if you can find it at all in the US, it's generally a pleasantly spiced simmered pork chopped into small pieces. (The flavor is a mixture of star anise and five spice, I believe.)  Here, though, it's a real piece of pork leg, slowly cooked in a five-spice mixture until fork tender (yes, it's Thai, you can use forks) -- and the kicker is the big layer of brown rendered skin with it.  It's soft and collageny and yummy... reminding me of hot evenings at the night market at Soi Thonglor.  And there was a lot of it.  (No hard boiled egg, which is normally standard, but I don't give a rat's ass about egg.  Fat is where it's at.)\n\n3) Koh Moo Yang.  This is grilled side of pork, very simple, with a spicy sauce that reminds me of that perfect sauce made by a Thai lady who used to grill chicken on top of the klong (from a cart perched on a large plywood board over an open sewer.)   This is an excellent and brutal dish, hotter than most things you will ever eat in US Thai restaurants.\n\n(A tip to all of you: \"moo\" means pig/pork. Yes, it's confusing to Muslims. Anyway, I think these guys know pork. Look for the \"moo.\")\n\n4) Pad See You.  The standard classic with pan-fried wide rice noodles, meat, egg, and a green vegetable -- Chinese broccoli in this case.  This was good rendition -- fairly \"burny\" -- but not as good as Thai Noodles.  The pork, however, was very tender, which reminded me of Bangkok.  I don't know what they do to the meat (maybe I don't want to know), but it took me back.\n\n5) Radna.  This dish (the simpler, weirder sister of Pad See You) is composed of a wide, chow-fun style rice noodle, stir fried with pork and chinese broccoli, and covered with a kind of gravy.  I've generally found that it is impossible to get a good version of this dish in the US -- usually the meat is overtough and the gravy is thin and insipid.  Sadly, I still remain unsatisfied -- while the meat was tender, the gravy had the usual problems.  On the other hand, there are two awesome dishes just waiting for you.\n\n6) Pad Ka Prao Krung Nai Gai.  This is basil stir fry with chicken entrails (gizzards, livers, etc.).  A very bold, spicy dish, but unfortunately, you almost never get real, licoricey Thai basil in the US -- and you still don't here.   However, this one is about as fierce and chewy (mmm, entrails) as you will ever get in the US.  Throw a little sugar or vinegar on to mellow this one out.\n\nSo the top 3 dishes both whipped the pants off my usual fave, Thai Noodle -- and the others were quite authentic too.  So San Franziskaners: forget Osha, Thep Phanom, and all those other places, and go here.  It's cheap and the menu is huge, with things I've never seen outside of Thailand. Oh, and they have one of the best selections of availabe condiments I've seen in a restaurant here.\n\nSee you there!\n\nTo see my other Thai food reviews, see my Thai Food list here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=9hnaS-bdeM5uKzKSgGBAOg", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Next time, I should try Koh Moo Yang instead. \n"], "author": "Aya C.", "review": "Larkin Street is where it's at.\nSome of the best Southeast Asian eateries are in the 'loin and Lers Ros Thai is definitely up there.

Let me take you back when this was my go-to Thai place that served up the most amazing Thai-style street food. Having been to Thailand and also being able to speak the language fluently and raised in this culture, I know my Thai food. The food was always consistent with the perfect balance of flavors that highlight the spicy, salty, sweet, and sour that is so characteristic of Thailand's cuisine. \n\nNow, fast forward to the new Lers Ros where it has expanded into the more chic neighborhoods (think Hayes Valley) and gotten lauded by more than one major foodie publications. I get that food prices have increased, and I do not mind paying good money for great food, but I do take issue with paying good money for not-so-great food. \n\nFood: We ordered a smorgasbord of the usual just to see if it would meet our earlier expectations, and I have to say that while I love that extra bit of sour in my dishes, I felt that the chef was having one hell of a day because it was as if she dumped the whole pint of lime juice into the majority of our dishes. You really had to wince as you took each bite, and the funny thing was that the heavy-handed sourness was apparent in nearly all the dishes we ordered. \n\nAppetizers/Salad:\n- Some Tum Koong (Papaya salad with grilled shrimp) - Spicy, but too sour.\n- Koh Moo Yang (Grilled pork shoulder) - Pork was tender, but the portion was definitely not commensurate with the price tag. Also, the chili dipping sauce was way too sour.\n- Larb Phed Yang (Roasted duck salad larb) - Normally, this is my FAVORITE dish on the menu (partially bc this dish essentially put them on the map), but dang, they plucked and squeezed all the limes from one tree into this dish so I could barely eat it.\n\nSoup:\n- Tom Kha Gai (Coconut chicken soup) - Again, way too sour. Normally, the flavors are balanced and I love how they serve it in a fire pot and sprinkle some chili oil on top. \n\nEntrees:\n- Pad See-Ew (Flat Noodle Chow Fun) - This was the ONLY dish that was well balanced and perfectly charred. We actually took this dish home because we loved it so much.\n- Pad Ka-na Moo Krob (Crispy fried 3-layer pork belly with Chinese gailan) - This dish was way too salty as it was prepared that day. Normally, it's also one of the best things on the menu for me since the pork is nice and crispy and the gailan is so fresh. Also, you can ask them to top it with a fried sunny side up egg for the authentic experience.\n\nPrice vs. Value: Our bill came up to $100+ (with tax & tip) for lunch, and it appears that everything on their menu is pegged at an average price point of close to $12. Times have definitely changed; I just wished the consistency of the food had not done the same. If you want to try it for yourself, be my guest. Just don't complain if you have to blink a few times as you take a bite. And then, once more when your bill comes out.\n\nService: The service is great.

Crowds eat late around here.\n\nLarb Phed Yang (duck salad) really shocks your socks as a first dish.  The lime flavor hits you until the spiciness settles into your throat and catches you off guard.  I love that you wrap the duck, red onion, and other bits into small cups of iceberg lettuce because it offsets the flavor with a coolness.\n\nKoh Moo Yang (grilled pork shoulder) is a must get like they all say!  It's a big piece with thin slices; some are lean and some have a 1 cm of fat attached.  I wouldn't expect a tender piece of meat but something that's more smokey and almost veering towards jerky (although not quite).  They really know how to work their sauces here because it was a great balance and not as tart as the salad.\n\nPork belly was a dish I couldn't find on the online menu but on the physical menu at the restaurant, it's number 60-something.  I would say this was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  The pork was roasted Chinese style with an uber crispy skin.  Again, some pieces were tougher than others but I'm thinking that's just how they do things here.  Don't expect the succulent, braised juicy pork belly with the glistening fat you're used to seeing; this is a more raw, homemade version.  Medium spiciness is a good level because you get the spice but that's not all you're thinking about.  Unlike the previous two dishes I mentioned, which were more appetizers, this dish is saucy and goes well with rice.\n\nPla Rad Prik (whole fried tilapia) surprised me that it was on the house specials list. Given that they do not make it generic with bottled chili sauce like other Thai restaurants, it does start tasting similar so I might have scratched this out to get a curry or soup for next time.  Website claims that fresh fish is guaranteed each day but it's hard to tell because it's fried to very well done and I couldn't distinguish the flaky texture of typical fresh fish.\n\nRad Nah (house secret gravy sauce with marinated pork and flat noodle) was another regret.  We wanted a noodle dish to fill us up and balance out the other dishes but this was more of a gravy entree with a small chunk of noodles, lots of veggies, and marinated pork.  Pork seems to be the theme of the night also so by this dish, I was porked out.  BUT...if you're craving rad nah, the gravy is pretty solid and goes well over your rice.\n\nPlaces like these shame generic Thai restaurants.  Like a Chinese person craving Panda Express, I suppose there will be moments where I'll just want a pad thai and the closest joint is good enough for that.  Lers Ros is definitely a special place though and I would gladly take anyone who claims they like Thai food.  We'll see what they know!  Also, service is fantastic.  Hostess joked with us and the server was cute as a button.

A good amount of soft and fatty duck pieces but the seasoning is on point. So much umami and flavor, tangy kick from the lime, mildly spicy chili, a little sweetness from the onion and scallion.

My friends insisted that this place has amazing food. Considering he is my Northern California food guide, I went with him to indulge. The place is found in the Tenderloin district, which is not the nicest part of the neighborhood. The restaurant was fairly empty since we got there around 6pm, before the big dinner rush. This place is nicer than your average hole in the wall joint, it's clean and it has some flat screens where they are usually playing sports. \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\nKoh Moo Yang\nTom Kha Kai\nKao Na Phed\n\nThe first course was Koh Moo Yang, which is grilled slices of pork shoulder, served with a chili powder sauce. Let me tell you, this dish is very, very tasty. The pork is juicy and is ultra tender. Dipping it in the chili powder sauce adds to the taste. SO GOOD! I would have been happy with just this one dish, but there were two more on the way!\n\nUp next was the Tom Kha Kai, a coconut milk based soup with chicken , lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. One popular Thai dish that I really don't like is Tom Yum Gai, and based on it's standard description of spicy, sour, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf chicken soup, sounds very similar to Tom Kha Kai. I was very skeptical about trying this dish with my severe dislike for Tom Yum Gai, but what the hey, I was on vacation and up for anything. To my surprise, this soup was yummy. It was a mix between a panang curry and tom yum gai, and the combination of the two was deilcious. I forgot to take a picture when it first came out due to it being so tasty so the half eaten shot below was all I could get!\n\nOur last dish of the night was the five spices duck over rice, served with chili and vinegar sauce, or otherwise known as: Kao Na Phed . At this point, I'm stuffed, but I had to make room for at least a bite of this. I only had one piece, but the one piece I had was perfect. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Another dish you just cannot go wrong with. \n\nAll in all, another highly recommended San Francisco gem. Just be careful if you go there after dark, the Tenderloin area is definitely not the safest area!\n\nread more of my reviews at www.thekitchenfloor.com", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-02-24"}, {"excerpts": ["TOM KHA KAI SOUP (w/ chicken)- yummm... comes in a big pot for everyone to try.

If you don't like sweet, the yellow curry is also one to stay away from.  I think a lot of people at the table liked this one, but I wasn't really into it.  It was hard to taste anything beside sugar in this dish.\n\nService was efficient and friendly.  This place is pretty busy, and they know how to move people and out without being rude or annoying.

First off the location is a bit dicey, but once you get past that you're in for some really awesome Thai food.  Was on holiday in SF and I heard the Asian food is quite good over here.  I had also been craving some really good Thai as I had yet to have some actual authentic Thai food, have pretty much been settling so far.  Came for lunch and it was pretty quiet - a Tuesday.  This place has a bar as well if you want to have some drinks.\n\nActually we ended up coming back here again so this review is for both visits.  We ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp, Lunch special with Chicken Red Curry and Kai Pad Khing and on the second visit the Pad See Ew with Beef, Green Curry and Kao Pad.\n\nPad Thai with Shrimp ($12.95) - I was a bit worried this was going to be overly sweet or something, sometimes you can't tell even when a place has really great reviews.  I asked for extra spicy and it was perfect - just the right amount of spice and it tasted soooo good!!! Really awesome and proper authentic Pad Thai, they had infused the spice so it wasn't just chillies all over the place - definitely recommend trying this dish, it was a standout.\nLunch Special, Red Curry Chicken and Kai Pad Khing ($11.95) - The ginger in the Kai Pad Khing was really fresh and strong - in a good way.  But I would suggest not getting the lunch specials/combos, they seem like they're quite standard, you can't make any changes like asking for extra spicy so guess they must be buffet style - go a la carte.  It wasn't bad but tasted a bit food courtish (not a word I know).\nPad See Ew with Beef ($12.95) - At first the waitress said that they couldn't do extra spicy for this but got her to check with the chef, as I got the Pad Thai extra spicy the day before so was sure they could do the same for this - and they can.  Again another awesome dish, great taste and good spice level - it was quite spicy but just right   Wouldn't suggest beef though, was a bit chewy, would try the shrimp next time.\nKang Keaw Wan - Green Curry ($14.95) - Really great too, flavourful and good quantity.\nThai Fried Rice ($11.95) - Delicious, just like the Kao Pad in Thailand, Australia and NZ - both of which also have super authentic Thai places.\n\nQuantity - Great quantity, we couldn't finish it all, of course on the second day we did overorder.\nAmbience - Small casual scene, went during weekday lunch times so not sure how it is during dinner time.\nService - Great service, accommodating and attentive.\nSpice - 4/5, Perfect amount of spice, actually bordering on a 5 since I did ask for extra but it wasn't an overkill which real Thai hot can be.\nTaste - Amazing, reminded me of the authentic Thai which was on every corner in AU and NZ and which I haven't had in the longest time.\n\nOverall the best Thai I've had in US so far, and I've tried a few now in Atlanta, Dallas and NJ.  This place was so good we had to have it again, actually had it 3 times as we ordered it through uber eats for dinner as well - it's that good and couldn't risk trying something else that I wouldn't love.  Get the Pad Thai, I'd say it was the best item I tried and seems to be a signature dish for the restaurant.

It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient. Glasses are refilled without having to look around and they even change your plates following appetizers and soup.\n\nBest of all, they even offer delivery until close at midnight.

The food is great!  \n\nI've been to Lers Ros several times already in the past month.  It's a good and reliable Thai restaurant with good food, large quantities (for lunch I always have to take portions of my food home as leftovers), and cheap prices (consider I have to take food home, that's like two meals for the price of ~$8-9.  Not bad.). \n\nThe lunch specials let you choose two dishes to go with rice, and it comes with a salad.  I ordered the red curry with pork, as well as the Kai Yang (marinated barbecued chicken, served with sweet and sour sauce).  My friend ordered an eggplant tofu dish (pad makuer tofu) and the yellow curry with pork.\n\nWe first had the salad.  I think this was the weakest point of the meal.  The dressing was a little too sweet and overpowering.  I'm not sure what type of dressing they use-- a derivative of sweet and sour sauce, perhaps?  It's a simple salad-- just cabbage and some shavings of carrot-- and the dressing was just too strong for the simplicity of the salad.  I would recommend toning down the amount of sweetness in the dressing.\n\nHowever, despite the salad, all our dishes were excellent.  The red curry was just spicy enough to take the edge off the cold from outside without being too spicy (SF weather has been-- well, SF weather has been, period.  It blows cold a lot, and it has definitely been blowing very cold and wet recently), and I really enjoyed the smokiness of the barbecued chicken.  It was an entire leg of chicken-- which is a TON of food for me.  So I brought half a leg of chicken home.  My curry, on the other hand, was too good to save, and I polished it off in record time (much to the dismay of my diet plans).  My friend finished off ALL her dishes.  In other words, she loved it.  :D\n\nUltimately, this place is excellent.

However, two of these dishes blew me away.  I just kept saying: \"Wow. Wow. Wow.\"  And this was because they tasted like dishes you would have in Bangkok, at really good places.\n\nSo far I've had 6 dishes:\n\n1) Kha Nah Moo Krob.  Confusingly, they put this on the menu under \"Rice Soup.\"  Unappetizingly, they call it Stir-Fired Pork with Crispy Rind.  But it's awesome -- the fatback pork is freshly fried to perfection, the chinese broccoli (that's the \"kha nah\") is fleshy with perfectly peeled stems, and the sauce is not just seriously umami -- it's also spiced in a way only confident Thai cooks will dare.  My friend says she gets this dish every time she goes, and I can see why.\n\n2) Kao Kha Moo.  Officially, this is whole stewed pig leg on rice, but if you can find it at all in the US, it's generally a pleasantly spiced simmered pork chopped into small pieces. (The flavor is a mixture of star anise and five spice, I believe.)  Here, though, it's a real piece of pork leg, slowly cooked in a five-spice mixture until fork tender (yes, it's Thai, you can use forks) -- and the kicker is the big layer of brown rendered skin with it.  It's soft and collageny and yummy... reminding me of hot evenings at the night market at Soi Thonglor.  And there was a lot of it.  (No hard boiled egg, which is normally standard, but I don't give a rat's ass about egg.  Fat is where it's at.)\n\n3) Koh Moo Yang.  This is grilled side of pork, very simple, with a spicy sauce that reminds me of that perfect sauce made by a Thai lady who used to grill chicken on top of the klong (from a cart perched on a large plywood board over an open sewer.)   This is an excellent and brutal dish, hotter than most things you will ever eat in US Thai restaurants.\n\n(A tip to all of you: \"moo\" means pig/pork. Yes, it's confusing to Muslims. Anyway, I think these guys know pork. Look for the \"moo.\")\n\n4) Pad See You.  The standard classic with pan-fried wide rice noodles, meat, egg, and a green vegetable -- Chinese broccoli in this case.  This was good rendition -- fairly \"burny\" -- but not as good as Thai Noodles.  The pork, however, was very tender, which reminded me of Bangkok.  I don't know what they do to the meat (maybe I don't want to know), but it took me back.\n\n5) Radna.  This dish (the simpler, weirder sister of Pad See You) is composed of a wide, chow-fun style rice noodle, stir fried with pork and chinese broccoli, and covered with a kind of gravy.  I've generally found that it is impossible to get a good version of this dish in the US -- usually the meat is overtough and the gravy is thin and insipid.  Sadly, I still remain unsatisfied -- while the meat was tender, the gravy had the usual problems.  On the other hand, there are two awesome dishes just waiting for you.\n\n6) Pad Ka Prao Krung Nai Gai.  This is basil stir fry with chicken entrails (gizzards, livers, etc.).  A very bold, spicy dish, but unfortunately, you almost never get real, licoricey Thai basil in the US -- and you still don't here.   However, this one is about as fierce and chewy (mmm, entrails) as you will ever get in the US.  Throw a little sugar or vinegar on to mellow this one out.\n\nSo the top 3 dishes both whipped the pants off my usual fave, Thai Noodle -- and the others were quite authentic too.  So San Franziskaners: forget Osha, Thep Phanom, and all those other places, and go here.  It's cheap and the menu is huge, with things I've never seen outside of Thailand. Oh, and they have one of the best selections of availabe condiments I've seen in a restaurant here.\n\nSee you there!\n\nTo see my other Thai food reviews, see my Thai Food list here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=9hnaS-bdeM5uKzKSgGBAOg", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Had Kao Kha Moo again.

First off the location is a bit dicey, but once you get past that you're in for some really awesome Thai food.  Was on holiday in SF and I heard the Asian food is quite good over here.  I had also been craving some really good Thai as I had yet to have some actual authentic Thai food, have pretty much been settling so far.  Came for lunch and it was pretty quiet - a Tuesday.  This place has a bar as well if you want to have some drinks.\n\nActually we ended up coming back here again so this review is for both visits.  We ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp, Lunch special with Chicken Red Curry and Kai Pad Khing and on the second visit the Pad See Ew with Beef, Green Curry and Kao Pad.\n\nPad Thai with Shrimp ($12.95) - I was a bit worried this was going to be overly sweet or something, sometimes you can't tell even when a place has really great reviews.  I asked for extra spicy and it was perfect - just the right amount of spice and it tasted soooo good!!! Really awesome and proper authentic Pad Thai, they had infused the spice so it wasn't just chillies all over the place - definitely recommend trying this dish, it was a standout.\nLunch Special, Red Curry Chicken and Kai Pad Khing ($11.95) - The ginger in the Kai Pad Khing was really fresh and strong - in a good way.  But I would suggest not getting the lunch specials/combos, they seem like they're quite standard, you can't make any changes like asking for extra spicy so guess they must be buffet style - go a la carte.  It wasn't bad but tasted a bit food courtish (not a word I know).\nPad See Ew with Beef ($12.95) - At first the waitress said that they couldn't do extra spicy for this but got her to check with the chef, as I got the Pad Thai extra spicy the day before so was sure they could do the same for this - and they can.  Again another awesome dish, great taste and good spice level - it was quite spicy but just right   Wouldn't suggest beef though, was a bit chewy, would try the shrimp next time.\nKang Keaw Wan - Green Curry ($14.95) - Really great too, flavourful and good quantity.\nThai Fried Rice ($11.95) - Delicious, just like the Kao Pad in Thailand, Australia and NZ - both of which also have super authentic Thai places.\n\nQuantity - Great quantity, we couldn't finish it all, of course on the second day we did overorder.\nAmbience - Small casual scene, went during weekday lunch times so not sure how it is during dinner time.\nService - Great service, accommodating and attentive.\nSpice - 4/5, Perfect amount of spice, actually bordering on a 5 since I did ask for extra but it wasn't an overkill which real Thai hot can be.\nTaste - Amazing, reminded me of the authentic Thai which was on every corner in AU and NZ and which I haven't had in the longest time.\n\nOverall the best Thai I've had in US so far, and I've tried a few now in Atlanta, Dallas and NJ.  This place was so good we had to have it again, actually had it 3 times as we ordered it through uber eats for dinner as well - it's that good and couldn't risk trying something else that I wouldn't love.  Get the Pad Thai, I'd say it was the best item I tried and seems to be a signature dish for the restaurant.

I love Thai food yet also think it is one of the most overdone cuisines with the majority of Thai restaurants being forgettable and also blueprints of each other in terms of menu and flavor.  \n\nThere have been some standouts.  I've long loved Marnee Thai when I lived in SF and I also loved King of Thai's more street food like take on fried rice plates and soup noodles that you rarely see at more mainstream Thai restaurants.  \n\nI've also been burned by a couple of critically acclaimed spots, most memorable Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas that boasted unusual flavors and unique dishes that were quite different from every Thai restaurant but that I simply did not like and found mediocre.  \n\nEnter Ler Ros.  With dishes like their famous pork belly and duck larb salad as well as their more exotic fare of alligator, frogs, and fresh deep fried fish, I knew I'd likely have a very unique meal.  I ordered a sampling of all their popular items and if I had more time, I'd likely have sampled even more from their impressive 100+ item menu.  \n\n#9 - Koo Moo Yang - Smoked Pork Shouder Appetizer.  Rich and fatty and perfect to dip in the tangy and savory sauce.  It's a great appetizer, but like many of the dishes decadent.  I definitely should have ordered plain white rice or soup noodles to counteract all my rich dishes.\n\n#25 Duck Larb Salad - 7x7 Magazine's famous item and worthy of the hype.  I've tried Larb Salad at Champa Garden and while it was tasty, I didn't love it.  The roast duck here is so good and there are so many herbs, onions, and spices, that it's easy to see why this is a hit.  It's a flavor explosion.\n\n#37 Roasted Duck Red Curry - this is a more mainstream item and I wanted to see how flavorful their curries were.  It was excellent.  Lots of depth and a slight tinge of heat with the medium spicy version.  Great with white rice and with lots of vegetables to balance the fatty duck.\n\n#54 Kao Pad - Fried Rice with Crab Meat.  I love this dish at King of Thai and it's similar here. Nice wok heat.  Lots of crab meat.  A touch oily but order some white rice and you'll have better balance. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob - another must order from most people.  It's crispy pork belly (or Chinese roasted pork) stir fried with herbs including basil.  The sauce is delicious. The pork pieces are super fatty and delicious.  You'll gain a million calories but it's definitely worth ordering once you're here.\n\n#76 - Pad Kee Mow - I usually order Pad See Ew or Pad Thai, but most recommend to try this noodle dish instead.  It's a touch spicy and more flavorful and salty than the other milder dishes.  Overall, good but not as strong as their notable items.  \n\nPluses from Ler Ros is that they have free delivery over $25 and within 2 miles of their locations and it comes all nicely packaged and hot.  \n\nOverall, I loved my meal here and while there is a lot of fatty, fried, and oily items, I think eating in house I'd order more soups or white rice to balance all the amazing flavors.  But the hype fit the bill and I'm glad to have added Ler Ros to my repertoire.  \n\nLer Ros accepts credit cards, including Amex.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Tom Yum Koong, and the Kao Pad.

It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient. Glasses are refilled without having to look around and they even change your plates following appetizers and soup.\n\nBest of all, they even offer delivery until close at midnight.

It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient. Glasses are refilled without having to look around and they even change your plates following appetizers and soup.\n\nBest of all, they even offer delivery until close at midnight.

The place is found in the Tenderloin district, which is not the nicest part of the neighborhood. The restaurant was fairly empty since we got there around 6pm, before the big dinner rush. This place is nicer than your average hole in the wall joint, it's clean and it has some flat screens where they are usually playing sports. \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\nKoh Moo Yang\nTom Kha Kai\nKao Na Phed\n\nThe first course was Koh Moo Yang, which is grilled slices of pork shoulder, served with a chili powder sauce. Let me tell you, this dish is very, very tasty. The pork is juicy and is ultra tender. Dipping it in the chili powder sauce adds to the taste. SO GOOD! I would have been happy with just this one dish, but there were two more on the way!\n\nUp next was the Tom Kha Kai, a coconut milk based soup with chicken , lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. One popular Thai dish that I really don't like is Tom Yum Gai, and based on it's standard description of spicy, sour, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf chicken soup, sounds very similar to Tom Kha Kai. I was very skeptical about trying this dish with my severe dislike for Tom Yum Gai, but what the hey, I was on vacation and up for anything. To my surprise, this soup was yummy. It was a mix between a panang curry and tom yum gai, and the combination of the two was deilcious. I forgot to take a picture when it first came out due to it being so tasty so the half eaten shot below was all I could get!\n\nOur last dish of the night was the five spices duck over rice, served with chili and vinegar sauce, or otherwise known as: Kao Na Phed .

I love Thai food yet also think it is one of the most overdone cuisines with the majority of Thai restaurants being forgettable and also blueprints of each other in terms of menu and flavor.  \n\nThere have been some standouts.  I've long loved Marnee Thai when I lived in SF and I also loved King of Thai's more street food like take on fried rice plates and soup noodles that you rarely see at more mainstream Thai restaurants.  \n\nI've also been burned by a couple of critically acclaimed spots, most memorable Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas that boasted unusual flavors and unique dishes that were quite different from every Thai restaurant but that I simply did not like and found mediocre.  \n\nEnter Ler Ros.  With dishes like their famous pork belly and duck larb salad as well as their more exotic fare of alligator, frogs, and fresh deep fried fish, I knew I'd likely have a very unique meal.  I ordered a sampling of all their popular items and if I had more time, I'd likely have sampled even more from their impressive 100+ item menu.  \n\n#9 - Koo Moo Yang - Smoked Pork Shouder Appetizer.  Rich and fatty and perfect to dip in the tangy and savory sauce.  It's a great appetizer, but like many of the dishes decadent.  I definitely should have ordered plain white rice or soup noodles to counteract all my rich dishes.\n\n#25 Duck Larb Salad - 7x7 Magazine's famous item and worthy of the hype.  I've tried Larb Salad at Champa Garden and while it was tasty, I didn't love it.  The roast duck here is so good and there are so many herbs, onions, and spices, that it's easy to see why this is a hit.  It's a flavor explosion.\n\n#37 Roasted Duck Red Curry - this is a more mainstream item and I wanted to see how flavorful their curries were.  It was excellent.  Lots of depth and a slight tinge of heat with the medium spicy version.  Great with white rice and with lots of vegetables to balance the fatty duck.\n\n#54 Kao Pad - Fried Rice with Crab Meat.  I love this dish at King of Thai and it's similar here. Nice wok heat.  Lots of crab meat.  A touch oily but order some white rice and you'll have better balance. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob - another must order from most people.  It's crispy pork belly (or Chinese roasted pork) stir fried with herbs including basil.  The sauce is delicious. The pork pieces are super fatty and delicious.  You'll gain a million calories but it's definitely worth ordering once you're here.\n\n#76 - Pad Kee Mow - I usually order Pad See Ew or Pad Thai, but most recommend to try this noodle dish instead.  It's a touch spicy and more flavorful and salty than the other milder dishes.  Overall, good but not as strong as their notable items.  \n\nPluses from Ler Ros is that they have free delivery over $25 and within 2 miles of their locations and it comes all nicely packaged and hot.  \n\nOverall, I loved my meal here and while there is a lot of fatty, fried, and oily items, I think eating in house I'd order more soups or white rice to balance all the amazing flavors.

I can't even explain how eating at this restaurant on night one of our ten day road trip from SD to SEA completely set the stage for awesomeness but it did.\n\nFirst off, the prices are fantastic for a city like San Francisco.  My friend and I were delightfully full when we left and spent only a whopping $34.61 before tip.  Secondly, the staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  The ambiance was pleasant as was the music (ambient and well-fitting to the place without being overly loud and drowning out the conversation my friend and I were having).  \n\nBeing the pseudo vegetarian that I am, I ordered the spicy tofu with rice (#46R).

Here are the memorable hits and misses:\n\nPad kra prow moo krob: Their famous pork belly dish. I was really excited about this dish b/c it seemed like a thai version of lechon kawali (Filipino deep fried pork belly). Lers Ros takes this dish a step further and stirfries deep fried pork belly with chili, basil and a sweet sauce. I was disappointed that the crispness of the fried pork belly was a bit soggy, but I attributed this to delivery. I plan on trying this at their restaurant location. \n\nSteamed sea bass: A whole steamed sea bass served in a coconut broth. The fish was very fresh and tender and perfectly accented by the light broth. This was a hit with my family and the favorite dish of the night. \n\nPad thai: Pretty standard. I prefer my pad thai to be sweeter. \n\nBbq chicken: YUM! I order this without fail every single time. The chicken is  flavorful and perfect with the Thai chili sauce. It remains surprisingly tender when served as leftovers the next day. \n\nPad kee mow: My bf's favorite noodle dish here.  Broad rice noodles, soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic, meat or tofu, bean sprouts, and various seasonings. Chili and basil give it a nice kick!\n\nYellow curry: Delicious! After all the chicken is gone, I like to save the curry broth and eat it with rice the next day. \n\nI've also been to the restaurant location and was pleasantly surprised by the classy decor and attentive service.

It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient.

What am I talking about??\n\nI love Thai food, I eat Thai food all the time. Lers Ros' menu is super expansive with lots of more unique offerings that appeal to my curious foodie side.  We straggled in around 10pm last nite, so we decided to opt for a smattering of the foods that have come highly recommended.  We ordered :1 ) Garlic quail which came with a hot dipping sauce; 2)Som Tom Koong Yang (Shredded green papaya salad with chili, tomatoes, lime based salad dressing & GRILLED PRAWNs); 3) the highly recommended Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (Stir-fried pork belly with crispy rind, Basil leaves, with red bell peppers, and green beans cut up to look like scallions); and 4) Kaeng Pah Pla Hed-Khon (Smelt fish in broth made from house made chili paste, young pepper corn and galingale).

I wasn't enjoying the flavors of the papaya salad since all I could feel was heat and the bitter sensation.\n\nOnce my taste buds came around, and the bitter sensation went away, I enjoyed the rest of my meal. I don't think I would order the fried quail again. I rather enjoy quail, but deep frying it makes the meat rather dry, and I like the meat to be more moist and tender.  The pork belly was delicious, the sauce was great, the crispy rind is reminiscent of a great Asian style roast pork.  I loved the smelt fish broth! The broth is like a spicy tom yum gong soup. The young peppercorn and galingale add a whole new level of spiciness to the soup. The bamboo shoots complimented the dish well. It was delicious.\n\nAfter we both got a handle on the heat level of the food, we were able to adjust our spiciness threshold and conquer the papaya salad. Although, if I were to order that dish again, I would ask for mild (which I'm sure will still pack a fair amount of heat). We left satisfied and quite full at around 11:15pm. A family with 3 little kids came in, and other couples were still streaming in.

My mother is Thai so my tastebuds have experienced everything that Thai food can be over the years.  Bottom line: Lers Ros definitely beats anything I've had in the Bay Area so far (excepting not having yet tried Thai House Express), but doesn't quite rise to the level of \"top-notch quality Thai food\" that can be found on rare occasions in this country.  As much as there was subtlety and complexity in the flavors, which were very much authentic, the interplay of spices, heat, and ingredients can be taken to another level or two.  In recent personal experience, Thai Siam in Arrington, VA (hole in the wall place with four tables run by a retired woman who grows most of the ingredients she uses and widely considered the best Thai currently on the East Coast) is dish for dish superior to Lers Ros.  That said, here's a rundown of our impressions of the dishes today - \n\n#27 Tom ka gai - the balance of flavors was about 90% there - chicken quality was high but a bit skimpy on the amount of chicken.  Flavors should have included a bit more intensity in the kaffir lime (and no additional option of adding squeezed lime was provided).  All in all, a fine rendition, but there was one or two layers of flavor disappointingly absent (yet more layers than I've discovered in your run-of-the-mill Thai eatery).  Perhaps it needed more lemongrass?  Or pepper?  Something...\n\n#9 - Kao moo yang - I really enjoyed this dish.  Pork had a subtly smokey flavor to it, but not overwhelming.  Interplayed extremely well with the chili powder sauce.  I appreciated that the intensity of the spiciness was set at just the right level to allow for both the under- and overtones of distinct flavors to come together. \n\n#4 Thai herb sausage - judging by scoop amount, I seemed to like this dish more than others in my party did.  It was a very pleasant rendition of the SE Asian-style sausage, which is one of my favorite Asian products to begin with.  So maybe I have a lower threshold for giving my stamp of approval on this one, but I could find no faults.  Tender, juicy, flavorful, not greasy.  A winner in my book.\n\n#13 - Som Tom - green papaya salad.  hmm - I thought this dish failed just a bit.  Kitchen really went hog wild on the spice level, which in itself is not automatically a criticism.  Problem was that they let spiciness be the one and only star here.  The prawns were flavorless, and the lime dressing seemed strangely diluted.  The dish lacked cohesiveness - all of the flavors were distinct elements and just didn't come together.  \n\n\"Chicken puff\" special: samosas, basically, with a peanut dipping sauce.  The puffs and filling were quite nice - crispy outside without being too crunchy, and soft flavorful filling.  I found the peanut sauce to be lacking, however.  There wasn't enough kick to the sauce, and frankly it reminded me of the \"dumbed down\" version of peanut sauces one finds much too often in Americanized Thai restaurants.  Instead of a goo, in my opinion a peanut sauce that was more granular in nature, and with a brighter flavor to its base, would have provided a better texture combination with the puff filing. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob stir-fried pork with crispy rind and basil leaves. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find the pork to be swimming excessively in sauce, or the sauce to be particularly fatty.  I enjoyed the crispy rind on the pork too - a nice contrast in flavor and texture.  This was a very \"comforting\" dish - but I could see the addition of one or two more flavor undertones would really make this dish come alive more than it did. \n\n#77 Pad See Ew - deliberately chosen to be our \"bread and butter\" dish.  One of ubiquity so as to directly compare a comfort food staple with others.  Verdict: eh.  They really phoned this one in.  I appreciated the use of gai lan as opposed to Western broccoli, but still there was nothing to this dish over that which you can find in any Thai place.  The noodles were somewhat goupy.  Kitchen really didn't do much to accentuate the complexities that this dish, despite being a dark sauce dish, can achieve if you really put some interest into it. \n\n#113 - Quick fried marinated trout with mango sauce - YES SIR!  This was an absolute winner, and is worth the trip in itself.  Definitely the star of the meal.  Perfectly crispy, bones, tail, skin, everything edible.  The quintessential Thai \"fish and chips\" (where the \"chips\" are actually the extra crispy parts of the fish!).  Wonderful flavoring to the fry itself, and equally wonderful pairing of mango sauce.  \n\nFinal verdict - if all dishes had been on the level of the #113, Lers Ros would be up there with some of the best I'd experienced in this country (Thai Siam in rural Virginia, the late Zab-e-lee in Atlanta before the good owner moved back to Thailand, Thai House in Anchorage, Alaska, the old Bangkok Thai Cuisine in Mobile, AL).

"], "author": "Patrick W.", "review": "Lers Ros has the most delicious, mouthwatering, can't-wait-to-try-more Thai food you'll ever eat in San Francisco. It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient. Glasses are refilled without having to look around and they even change your plates following appetizers and soup.\n\nBest of all, they even offer delivery until close at midnight.

I wasn't enjoying the flavors of the papaya salad since all I could feel was heat and the bitter sensation.\n\nOnce my taste buds came around, and the bitter sensation went away, I enjoyed the rest of my meal. I don't think I would order the fried quail again. I rather enjoy quail, but deep frying it makes the meat rather dry, and I like the meat to be more moist and tender.  The pork belly was delicious, the sauce was great, the crispy rind is reminiscent of a great Asian style roast pork.  I loved the smelt fish broth! The broth is like a spicy tom yum gong soup. The young peppercorn and galingale add a whole new level of spiciness to the soup. The bamboo shoots complimented the dish well. It was delicious.\n\nAfter we both got a handle on the heat level of the food, we were able to adjust our spiciness threshold and conquer the papaya salad. Although, if I were to order that dish again, I would ask for mild (which I'm sure will still pack a fair amount of heat). We left satisfied and quite full at around 11:15pm.

I love Thai food yet also think it is one of the most overdone cuisines with the majority of Thai restaurants being forgettable and also blueprints of each other in terms of menu and flavor.  \n\nThere have been some standouts.  I've long loved Marnee Thai when I lived in SF and I also loved King of Thai's more street food like take on fried rice plates and soup noodles that you rarely see at more mainstream Thai restaurants.  \n\nI've also been burned by a couple of critically acclaimed spots, most memorable Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas that boasted unusual flavors and unique dishes that were quite different from every Thai restaurant but that I simply did not like and found mediocre.  \n\nEnter Ler Ros.  With dishes like their famous pork belly and duck larb salad as well as their more exotic fare of alligator, frogs, and fresh deep fried fish, I knew I'd likely have a very unique meal.  I ordered a sampling of all their popular items and if I had more time, I'd likely have sampled even more from their impressive 100+ item menu.  \n\n#9 - Koo Moo Yang - Smoked Pork Shouder Appetizer.  Rich and fatty and perfect to dip in the tangy and savory sauce.  It's a great appetizer, but like many of the dishes decadent.  I definitely should have ordered plain white rice or soup noodles to counteract all my rich dishes.\n\n#25 Duck Larb Salad - 7x7 Magazine's famous item and worthy of the hype.  I've tried Larb Salad at Champa Garden and while it was tasty, I didn't love it.  The roast duck here is so good and there are so many herbs, onions, and spices, that it's easy to see why this is a hit.  It's a flavor explosion.\n\n#37 Roasted Duck Red Curry - this is a more mainstream item and I wanted to see how flavorful their curries were.  It was excellent.  Lots of depth and a slight tinge of heat with the medium spicy version.  Great with white rice and with lots of vegetables to balance the fatty duck.\n\n#54 Kao Pad - Fried Rice with Crab Meat.  I love this dish at King of Thai and it's similar here. Nice wok heat.  Lots of crab meat.  A touch oily but order some white rice and you'll have better balance. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob - another must order from most people.  It's crispy pork belly (or Chinese roasted pork) stir fried with herbs including basil.  The sauce is delicious. The pork pieces are super fatty and delicious.  You'll gain a million calories but it's definitely worth ordering once you're here.\n\n#76 - Pad Kee Mow - I usually order Pad See Ew or Pad Thai, but most recommend to try this noodle dish instead.  It's a touch spicy and more flavorful and salty than the other milder dishes.  Overall, good but not as strong as their notable items.  \n\nPluses from Ler Ros is that they have free delivery over $25 and within 2 miles of their locations and it comes all nicely packaged and hot.  \n\nOverall, I loved my meal here and while there is a lot of fatty, fried, and oily items, I think eating in house I'd order more soups or white rice to balance all the amazing flavors.

But in the end THE steady cooking consistency prevailed.\n\nPlease note that they both have since revised their hours, to close at midnight.\n\nWhen I first dined here some time ago I would have given LRT 5 stars, but after months of late night (after 10pm) dining I have to say that the late night kitchen crew just doesn't measure up. THE's late night kitchen cooks are more experienced, so food consistency is way better than LRT. Some of the irregularities I found were that:\n\n1 - the chicken meat on curry dishes was a little dry. Meat cooked in coconut milk should not be dry, unless it was precooked and combined later - I think that the night kitchen crew precooked the meats to save time. Chicken green curry (#36) dish http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/QUFC-saM20oGdnrF3SdcoA/l\n\n2 - so far, the night cooks just don't know how to do stir-fry noodles right. I ordered a few stir-fried flat noodle dishes during several days, and they always came out clumped, even the soupy Rad Na (#79) dish had clumped flat noodles.

We got it, but thanks.\" THE BUM THEN SAYS, \"GIMME $2 AND I WON'T BREAK INTO YOUR CAR.\" My buddy says, \"Damn, here's a dollar... it's all I got.\" The bum then takes the dollar and shouts out...

Most of the time when I'm craving Thai, Thai House Express is where I go. The last time I went and walked past Lers Ros Thai, it was packed! I made a mental note to try it out. \nOne Thai craving later, I ended up here. First things first- the decor and atmosphere. It was kind of early for dinner (5:30pm) so there were only 2 other tables occupied. The furniture was meh and it kind of smelled funny. Funny smell aside, I was hungry and ready to let my eyes do their thing and scan the menu. I had read about the pork with crispy edges but the green seafood curry caught my eye and made my stomach tingle with delight. The bf ordered crispy chicken over fried rice and we shared a chicken satay appetizer. \n\nAppetizer- 4 pieces of yummy chicken, peanut sauce and cucumbers with red onion. Really good altogether. \n\nGreen seafood curry- surprisingly big. No rice and kind of spicy so I had to order a side of rice (which is really a container of rice, like 2 servings). It included squid, prawns, bamboo, bell peppers, basil and fish balls in a deliciously fragrant and flavorful green curry. Yum! I couldn't finish it all so I took it home and it will get in my tummy tomorrow for lunch. \n\nCrispy chicken over fried rice- ok portion of strips of crispy chicken with sweet & sour sauce (bravo on the sauce!) over fried rice. Pretty darn good! The bf saved some peanut sauce to pour over his rice... so smart, that one. \n\nService- above average. She was very attentive and I didn't have to search long to find her when I needed something. \n\nDrinks- an unusually large variety of alcohol! They served reds, whites, sakes. They also have a bar despite their small size.\n\nA note about the menu that a few of the other Yelpers have already mentioned but I will echo- the menu is definitely more adventurous than usual Thai restaurants. There are the usual pad thai, pad kee mow but I also saw alligator over  fried rice and frog leg appetizers. \n\nSo... definitely worth trying, especially if you've done the Thai thing more than a couple times in the neighborhood.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I don't know about y'all, but I'm loving their Pad Kee Mow.

On a Friday night at around 8pm, the wait was about 15-20 minutes but quickly escalated after that.  Crowds eat late around here.\n\nLarb Phed Yang (duck salad) really shocks your socks as a first dish.  The lime flavor hits you until the spiciness settles into your throat and catches you off guard.  I love that you wrap the duck, red onion, and other bits into small cups of iceberg lettuce because it offsets the flavor with a coolness.\n\nKoh Moo Yang (grilled pork shoulder) is a must get like they all say!  It's a big piece with thin slices; some are lean and some have a 1 cm of fat attached.  I wouldn't expect a tender piece of meat but something that's more smokey and almost veering towards jerky (although not quite).  They really know how to work their sauces here because it was a great balance and not as tart as the salad.\n\nPork belly was a dish I couldn't find on the online menu but on the physical menu at the restaurant, it's number 60-something.  I would say this was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  The pork was roasted Chinese style with an uber crispy skin.  Again, some pieces were tougher than others but I'm thinking that's just how they do things here.  Don't expect the succulent, braised juicy pork belly with the glistening fat you're used to seeing; this is a more raw, homemade version.  Medium spiciness is a good level because you get the spice but that's not all you're thinking about.  Unlike the previous two dishes I mentioned, which were more appetizers, this dish is saucy and goes well with rice.\n\nPla Rad Prik (whole fried tilapia) surprised me that it was on the house specials list. Given that they do not make it generic with bottled chili sauce like other Thai restaurants, it does start tasting similar so I might have scratched this out to get a curry or soup for next time.  Website claims that fresh fish is guaranteed each day but it's hard to tell because it's fried to very well done and I couldn't distinguish the flaky texture of typical fresh fish.\n\nRad Nah (house secret gravy sauce with marinated pork and flat noodle) was another regret.  We wanted a noodle dish to fill us up and balance out the other dishes but this was more of a gravy entree with a small chunk of noodles, lots of veggies, and marinated pork.

While the wait for a table wasn't terrible, the place was still pretty darn crowded!

I've had it every time I've been to Lers Ros and it has never failed me.  Tender and perfectly seasoned, the spicy chili sauce isn't necessary, but adds that much more flavor.  Freaking delicious!\n\n- Kang Keaw Wan (Green Curry with Thai Eggplant, Red Bell Peppers, Kaffir Lime Leaves and Chicken) - maybe it's because of the coconut milk base, but I loved the the richness of the curry.  It's got a little heat to it, but in a good way...one of my favorite Thai curries.\n\n- Pad Krapow - (Ground Pork stir-fried with Basil and house special sauce) - really savory and oh so delicious.  Their house sauce is really what makes the dish, and whatever they put in there is definitely special.\n\n- Rad Nah (Marinated Pork with House Secret Gravy on Flat Noodles) - a little different than I had expected (didn't expect there to be THAT much sauce), but still liked it regardless.  A little heavy on the white pepper, but I was okay with it.\n\nIn addition, we also ordered a couple of vegetarian dishes, but I held off from trying them to make sure our friend had enough to eat.

Subtle flavors made this a popular dish at the table. \n\nCrispy chicken with fried rice: they must've put crack in this.  It's definitely Asian-style fried chicken, but with a slightly sweet flavor.  The fried rice that comes with it is some of the best fried rice I've ever had - they must put crack in it!\n\nFish paste green curry: It's probably not a dish for everyone, but if you want green curry with non-fishy fish in chunks with a consistency similar to fish cakes this is the dish for you.  The green curry had just enough spice in it and was flavorful.

However, I would forgo getting it to-go because comes in a cup half the size the one they serve in the restaurant.\n\nOverall, we have not had any bad experiences with Les Ros and would highly recommend this place.

My friend an I had lunch here yesterday, and I have to admit, there's definitely a reason why I keep coming back (besides the fact that the space inside is so clean and spacious that I forget that I live in the Tenderloin).  The food is great!  \n\nI've been to Lers Ros several times already in the past month.  It's a good and reliable Thai restaurant with good food, large quantities (for lunch I always have to take portions of my food home as leftovers), and cheap prices (consider I have to take food home, that's like two meals for the price of ~$8-9.  Not bad.). \n\nThe lunch specials let you choose two dishes to go with rice, and it comes with a salad.  I ordered the red curry with pork, as well as the Kai Yang (marinated barbecued chicken, served with sweet and sour sauce).  My friend ordered an eggplant tofu dish (pad makuer tofu) and the yellow curry with pork.\n\nWe first had the salad.  I think this was the weakest point of the meal.  The dressing was a little too sweet and overpowering.  I'm not sure what type of dressing they use-- a derivative of sweet and sour sauce, perhaps?  It's a simple salad-- just cabbage and some shavings of carrot-- and the dressing was just too strong for the simplicity of the salad.  I would recommend toning down the amount of sweetness in the dressing.\n\nHowever, despite the salad, all our dishes were excellent.  The red curry was just spicy enough to take the edge off the cold from outside without being too spicy (SF weather has been-- well, SF weather has been, period.  It blows cold a lot, and it has definitely been blowing very cold and wet recently), and I really enjoyed the smokiness of the barbecued chicken.  It was an entire leg of chicken-- which is a TON of food for me.  So I brought half a leg of chicken home.  My curry, on the other hand, was too good to save, and I polished it off in record time (much to the dismay of my diet plans).  My friend finished off ALL her dishes.  In other words, she loved it.  :D\n\nUltimately, this place is excellent.

It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious.

Crowds eat late around here.\n\nLarb Phed Yang (duck salad) really shocks your socks as a first dish.  The lime flavor hits you until the spiciness settles into your throat and catches you off guard.  I love that you wrap the duck, red onion, and other bits into small cups of iceberg lettuce because it offsets the flavor with a coolness.\n\nKoh Moo Yang (grilled pork shoulder) is a must get like they all say!  It's a big piece with thin slices; some are lean and some have a 1 cm of fat attached.  I wouldn't expect a tender piece of meat but something that's more smokey and almost veering towards jerky (although not quite).  They really know how to work their sauces here because it was a great balance and not as tart as the salad.\n\nPork belly was a dish I couldn't find on the online menu but on the physical menu at the restaurant, it's number 60-something.  I would say this was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  The pork was roasted Chinese style with an uber crispy skin.  Again, some pieces were tougher than others but I'm thinking that's just how they do things here.  Don't expect the succulent, braised juicy pork belly with the glistening fat you're used to seeing; this is a more raw, homemade version.  Medium spiciness is a good level because you get the spice but that's not all you're thinking about.

Website claims that fresh fish is guaranteed each day but it's hard to tell because it's fried to very well done and I couldn't distinguish the flaky texture of typical fresh fish.\n\nRad Nah (house secret gravy sauce with marinated pork and flat noodle) was another regret.  We wanted a noodle dish to fill us up and balance out the other dishes but this was more of a gravy entree with a small chunk of noodles, lots of veggies, and marinated pork.  Pork seems to be the theme of the night also so by this dish, I was porked out.  BUT...if you're craving rad nah, the gravy is pretty solid and goes well over your rice.\n\nPlaces like these shame generic Thai restaurants.

However, two of these dishes blew me away.  I just kept saying: \"Wow. Wow. Wow.\"  And this was because they tasted like dishes you would have in Bangkok, at really good places.\n\nSo far I've had 6 dishes:\n\n1) Kha Nah Moo Krob.  Confusingly, they put this on the menu under \"Rice Soup.\"  Unappetizingly, they call it Stir-Fired Pork with Crispy Rind.  But it's awesome -- the fatback pork is freshly fried to perfection, the chinese broccoli (that's the \"kha nah\") is fleshy with perfectly peeled stems, and the sauce is not just seriously umami -- it's also spiced in a way only confident Thai cooks will dare.  My friend says she gets this dish every time she goes, and I can see why.\n\n2) Kao Kha Moo.  Officially, this is whole stewed pig leg on rice, but if you can find it at all in the US, it's generally a pleasantly spiced simmered pork chopped into small pieces. (The flavor is a mixture of star anise and five spice, I believe.)  Here, though, it's a real piece of pork leg, slowly cooked in a five-spice mixture until fork tender (yes, it's Thai, you can use forks) -- and the kicker is the big layer of brown rendered skin with it.  It's soft and collageny and yummy... reminding me of hot evenings at the night market at Soi Thonglor.  And there was a lot of it.  (No hard boiled egg, which is normally standard, but I don't give a rat's ass about egg.  Fat is where it's at.)\n\n3) Koh Moo Yang.  This is grilled side of pork, very simple, with a spicy sauce that reminds me of that perfect sauce made by a Thai lady who used to grill chicken on top of the klong (from a cart perched on a large plywood board over an open sewer.)   This is an excellent and brutal dish, hotter than most things you will ever eat in US Thai restaurants.\n\n(A tip to all of you: \"moo\" means pig/pork. Yes, it's confusing to Muslims. Anyway, I think these guys know pork. Look for the \"moo.\")\n\n4) Pad See You.  The standard classic with pan-fried wide rice noodles, meat, egg, and a green vegetable -- Chinese broccoli in this case.  This was good rendition -- fairly \"burny\" -- but not as good as Thai Noodles.  The pork, however, was very tender, which reminded me of Bangkok.  I don't know what they do to the meat (maybe I don't want to know), but it took me back.\n\n5) Radna.  This dish (the simpler, weirder sister of Pad See You) is composed of a wide, chow-fun style rice noodle, stir fried with pork and chinese broccoli, and covered with a kind of gravy.  I've generally found that it is impossible to get a good version of this dish in the US -- usually the meat is overtough and the gravy is thin and insipid.  Sadly, I still remain unsatisfied -- while the meat was tender, the gravy had the usual problems.  On the other hand, there are two awesome dishes just waiting for you.\n\n6) Pad Ka Prao Krung Nai Gai.  This is basil stir fry with chicken entrails (gizzards, livers, etc.).  A very bold, spicy dish, but unfortunately, you almost never get real, licoricey Thai basil in the US -- and you still don't here.   However, this one is about as fierce and chewy (mmm, entrails) as you will ever get in the US.  Throw a little sugar or vinegar on to mellow this one out.\n\nSo the top 3 dishes both whipped the pants off my usual fave, Thai Noodle -- and the others were quite authentic too.  So San Franziskaners: forget Osha, Thep Phanom, and all those other places, and go here.  It's cheap and the menu is huge, with things I've never seen outside of Thailand. Oh, and they have one of the best selections of availabe condiments I've seen in a restaurant here.\n\nSee you there!\n\nTo see my other Thai food reviews, see my Thai Food list here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=9hnaS-bdeM5uKzKSgGBAOg", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["There's also a section of \"rice soup\" with tapa like dishes, which is similar to Chinese congee except the dishes are flavored in yummy lime, chili and peanuts.

This is grilled side of pork, very simple, with a spicy sauce that reminds me of that perfect sauce made by a Thai lady who used to grill chicken on top of the klong (from a cart perched on a large plywood board over an open sewer.)   This is an excellent and brutal dish, hotter than most things you will ever eat in US Thai restaurants.\n\n(A tip to all of you: \"moo\" means pig/pork. Yes, it's confusing to Muslims. Anyway, I think these guys know pork. Look for the \"moo.\")\n\n4) Pad See You.  The standard classic with pan-fried wide rice noodles, meat, egg, and a green vegetable -- Chinese broccoli in this case.  This was good rendition -- fairly \"burny\" -- but not as good as Thai Noodles.  The pork, however, was very tender, which reminded me of Bangkok.  I don't know what they do to the meat (maybe I don't want to know), but it took me back.\n\n5) Radna.  This dish (the simpler, weirder sister of Pad See You) is composed of a wide, chow-fun style rice noodle, stir fried with pork and chinese broccoli, and covered with a kind of gravy.  I've generally found that it is impossible to get a good version of this dish in the US -- usually the meat is overtough and the gravy is thin and insipid.  Sadly, I still remain unsatisfied -- while the meat was tender, the gravy had the usual problems.  On the other hand, there are two awesome dishes just waiting for you.\n\n6) Pad Ka Prao Krung Nai Gai.  This is basil stir fry with chicken entrails (gizzards, livers, etc.).  A very bold, spicy dish, but unfortunately, you almost never get real, licoricey Thai basil in the US -- and you still don't here.   However, this one is about as fierce and chewy (mmm, entrails) as you will ever get in the US.  Throw a little sugar or vinegar on to mellow this one out.\n\nSo the top 3 dishes both whipped the pants off my usual fave, Thai Noodle -- and the others were quite authentic too.  So San Franziskaners: forget Osha, Thep Phanom, and all those other places, and go here.  It's cheap and the menu is huge, with things I've never seen outside of Thailand. Oh, and they have one of the best selections of availabe condiments I've seen in a restaurant here.\n\nSee you there!\n\nTo see my other Thai food reviews, see my Thai Food list here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=9hnaS-bdeM5uKzKSgGBAOg", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-06-28"}], "pak bookg fai daeng seasonal please ask": [], "kai jeaw koong sup": [], "jasmine steamed rice": [], "jasmine steamed brown rice": [], "steamed rice noodle": [], "garlic and ginger rice": [{"excerpts": ["I had a crispy chicken served on a bed of garlic and ginger rice.\n\n"], "author": "Shourjo D.", "review": "We came with a medium sized group and ordered a variety of things, and were pretty happy with everything that came our way.\n\nI had a crispy chicken served on a bed of garlic and ginger rice.\n\nAlso would recommend any of the noodle dishes, and also a Thai puff pastry appetizer.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-08-25"}, {"excerpts": ["My man had crispy chicken over garlic and ginger rice and that really good.

THE was open until 1am, while LRT decided to stay open until 2am. LRT has an extensive menu and many unique items, plus the place is new so decor is nicer & cleaner inside. But in the end THE steady cooking consistency prevailed.\n\nPlease note that they both have since revised their hours, to close at midnight.\n\nWhen I first dined here some time ago I would have given LRT 5 stars, but after months of late night (after 10pm) dining I have to say that the late night kitchen crew just doesn't measure up. THE's late night kitchen cooks are more experienced, so food consistency is way better than LRT. Some of the irregularities I found were that:\n\n1 - the chicken meat on curry dishes was a little dry. Meat cooked in coconut milk should not be dry, unless it was precooked and combined later - I think that the night kitchen crew precooked the meats to save time. Chicken green curry (#36) dish http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/QUFC-saM20oGdnrF3SdcoA/l\n\n2 - so far, the night cooks just don't know how to do stir-fry noodles right. I ordered a few stir-fried flat noodle dishes during several days, and they always came out clumped, even the soupy Rad Na (#79) dish had clumped flat noodles. Worst version of a Pad see ew (#77) dish I've ever had - edible, but with mushed and clumped flat noodles. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/fRgMUz-N4rsJkXxJkJWHow/l\n\nBut don't get me wrong, I still consider this restaurant a favorite (2nd best Thai place, behind THE). Friendly and pleasant service, in addition to an extensive menu (can be overwhelming) that includes many unique dishes not found elsewhere, plus items like rabbit, frog, venison, alligator, etc. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/FxSPi6lVEOshX1Iv5kEM4w/l\n\nMy favorite appetizer is the pork shoulder (#9), although the sauce can be a little gritty.

One thing I love about eating is trying new and unusual dishes!\n\nWe went for the Red Curry, Stewed Pork Leg and the Pad Ped Alligator. The Red Curry was well-executed with good consistency flavor. The Stew Pork Leg was served on a bed of assorted vegetables ranging from simple greens and pickled vegetables. The pork was very juicy and moist as was the skin of the leg. Even so, the skin and fat could be somewhat overwhelming on its own unless eaten with something else like the rice or vegetables. The gator was quite an adventure! From the looks, you might think it's pork or dark chicken meat. The texture is similar to pork, but the flavor is funky. In a way, it's gamey and has a flavor of where its been. The chili peppers doesn't really help with masking that gaminess, but it's good in its own way. \n\nThe service was efficient and friendly. No problems there. Parking might be since my friends had to park some distance away.

I didn't want to overwhelm him by ordering other \"exotic\" food items. He did like it even though there were minor complaints. I didn't care because I got him to taste something different which he ended up liking.
