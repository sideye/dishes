As a child, I ate tons of this stuff called Lucas.  It's a little shaker full of chili powder, citric acid, salt, and a little sugar.  The overwhelming sour/salty flavor gave me this visceral flavor high when I ate it.  Same with the Tom Kha Gai.  The intensity is almost too much, but it's exquisite.\n\nPad Kee-Mao (#66, spicy noodles with Chinese broccoli) is another favorite of mine.  The Pad King (#76, choice of meat with ginger, carrots, jalapeno, and black fungus) is great for anyone who loves ginger.  I just tried the Gang Panang Nuer (#52, beef in red curry) last night.  It was fantastic and may be my new favorite curry.  The beef had zero fat or gristle.  I've also tried the Roti dessert with ice cream.  It was flaky and wonderful, but I thought the ice cream didn't really mesh with the pancake.  I think it would have been better with some sweetened creme fraiche or as an appetizer with curry dipping sauce.  On its own, however, the coconut ice cream totally rocked.  I've only tried about five different varieties, but this was the best.  \n\nI do have to mention the Por-Pier Sod (#2, rice paper rolls stuffed with sausage, egg, tofu, and cucumber, topped with crab meat and sour tamarind sauce).  It was actually revolting.  I expected a regular cool, refreshing rice paper roll.  What I got was two giant rolls served side by side like a couple of burritos, cut into slices crosswise.  They were served warm (!?!) and were drenched in this gross sweet gravy.  They were disgusting and impossible to eat.  I also dislike their Por-Pier Pak (#4, vegetarian egg rolls).

This was EXCELLENT.  The rice paper had the perfect texture...not too flimsy or too hard from being undercooked.  I was initially hesitant on the tamarind sauce but it was light and sweet--usually it's too sour.  I definitely recommend that you get this.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup (noodle soup with sliced beef, beef balls, beef strew & tripe) - This was ok.  I probably wouldn't order it again.  The bf thinks there might be some MSG in it.  With noodle soups, you can get them with flat rice noodles, rice stick noodles, vermicelli or egg noodles.  I got flat rice noodles for both this and the dish below and they were great.\n\nTom Yum Noodle Soup (hot spicy noodle soup with ground pork, slice pork, pork balls and peanuts) - If you are pretty good with spiciness, GET THIS IN MEDIUM.  This was my favorite dish out of all the ones we ordered.  It has such a deep and rich flavor.  And the peanuts and cilantro make the noodles smell so fragrant.  I'm normally not a fan of anything tom yum but this has changed me forever.\n\nKao Ka Moo (special pork leg stew over rice) - Very similar to my dad's Chinese style pork feet dish!!

After reviewing many ChowHound and Yelp reports, here's what we ordered from the blogs recos: Kao Ka Moo (Stewed Pork Leg over Rice), Shrimp Paste Fried Rice and the House Special Pumpkin Curry with Chicken (which was a special that day).\n\nStewed Pork Leg Over Rice (3 stars out of 5)\nOverall, I enjoyed this subtle dish. It's very similar to the one my mom makes except she cooks with pork hock (read pigs feet). Me thinks this is really an Ethnic Chinese dish as it's prevalent in Chinese deli places all over SoCal. It is stewed with dark superior soy, ginger, garlic, sugar and star of anise. The skin has a deep complex flavor with that smokey soy and unmistakable flavor that only comes from star of anise after countless hours of stewing. It's served over rice with a clear broth that's been mixed in with the stewing liquid. The issue I have is that the broth was bland and really dumbed down the stewing liquid since they added too much of it. But I think I'm hardcore cause the version my mom makes is 10 times more flavorful and would give mainstream eaters an aneurysm.\n\nShrimp Paste Fried Rice (2.5 stars out of 5)\nOK, maybe I'm a food snob but I was disappointed with this dish because the name is misleading. Jas and I both agreed that the quality of the ingredients were really fresh and it was nicely presented. However, we could not taste any hint of Shrimp Paste in this dish! It was good \"Shrimp Fried Rice\" but where's the friggin' paste? And it was a tad greasy to boot (unforgiveable for good fried rice). Shrimp Paste is one of those things that if you cook with it, your entire apartment building will know because it will smell like you picked up a beached whale and it's been sitting in your hot humid apartment for a good month or so. But oh, the taste! It's one of those Stinky Tofu experiences - if you can relate. If you can't, ping me and I'll take you for some stinky tofu. Next time, if we order it, we'll ask for extra shrimp paste. I think it was dialed down for the Western audience. \n\nChicken Pumpkin Curry (2.5 stars out of 5)\nI never had Pumpkin Curry with so much Lemon Grass before. And they used white meat. Sorry, we don't know any \"authentic\" Asian restaurant that uses white meat. The meat was so dense, overcooked and fat-less that it just can't absorb the flavor of the sauce or curry.  I think it was fine but OSHA's version is much better. Smokey and complex with a million grams of fat from the coconut milk. I'm not a huge OSHA fan unless I'm expensing it but they do a couple of dishes really well like the Pumpkin Curry and Crispy Pork.\n\nOVERALL:\nI think this is a good Thai restaurant. They have some dishes that just do not exist on other menus but I think it's very overhyped. If I lived in the Tenderloin, I would totally come here for quick take-out.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-08-10"}], "moo dang": [{"excerpts": ["Along the same lines is #43 - Kao Moo Dang which is roasted pork over rice with this yummy gravy saucy stuff.

As a child, I ate tons of this stuff called Lucas.  It's a little shaker full of chili powder, citric acid, salt, and a little sugar.  The overwhelming sour/salty flavor gave me this visceral flavor high when I ate it.  Same with the Tom Kha Gai.  The intensity is almost too much, but it's exquisite.\n\nPad Kee-Mao (#66, spicy noodles with Chinese broccoli) is another favorite of mine.  The Pad King (#76, choice of meat with ginger, carrots, jalapeno, and black fungus) is great for anyone who loves ginger.  I just tried the Gang Panang Nuer (#52, beef in red curry) last night.  It was fantastic and may be my new favorite curry.  The beef had zero fat or gristle.  I've also tried the Roti dessert with ice cream.  It was flaky and wonderful, but I thought the ice cream didn't really mesh with the pancake.  I think it would have been better with some sweetened creme fraiche or as an appetizer with curry dipping sauce.  On its own, however, the coconut ice cream totally rocked.  I've only tried about five different varieties, but this was the best.  \n\nI do have to mention the Por-Pier Sod (#2, rice paper rolls stuffed with sausage, egg, tofu, and cucumber, topped with crab meat and sour tamarind sauce).  It was actually revolting.  I expected a regular cool, refreshing rice paper roll.  What I got was two giant rolls served side by side like a couple of burritos, cut into slices crosswise.  They were served warm (!?!) and were drenched in this gross sweet gravy.  They were disgusting and impossible to eat.  I also dislike their Por-Pier Pak (#4, vegetarian egg rolls).  And their Peak Gai Tod (#9, fried chicken wings) just tasted weird.  Boyfriend joked that maybe they were from Thai chickens and while absurd, it rang true.\n\nEven though I disliked those three dishes, I still adore Thai House Express.  And it's like magic- even though most their dishes cost the same $7-$8 that many other places do, the bill always comes to surprisingly little.  I don't want to know how, I just want to enjoy it.

The lady was very nice on the phone and got everything down correctly. 10 minutes later we walked in, picked up our food (which was expertly packed for take out) trotted back to the motel and commenced to GRUB DOWN. The restaurant itself was clean and bright, with your standard import store decor. \nWe ordered the Pad Thai with chicken (the dish had tofu and shrimp in it by default--we wanted chicken too and there was lots of it!) I forgot to say \"medium heat/spice\" on the phone so i wasnt sure if it would be hot or not. It was NOT spicy--not even a little. Next time I'll definitely ask for a little heat, but its better to error on the side of \"not enough heat\" than to have a dish \"too spicy to eat\"....\nThe pad thai had great flavor and the tofu was very tender but kept its shape in nice little cubes. The chicken was sooooo tasty and the egg was AMAZING too (i love the egg in my pad thai--one of life's little perks!) Fyi, i didnt eat the shrimp--gave them to the BF. There were 3 big shrimp and he said they tasted good. The bean sprouts were placed on top of the dish--fresh and crunchy. (This was helpful, as i only like a few bean sprouts so i hate it when the sprouts are mixed with the pad thai noodles so I must rummage around my dish, pulling out sprouts. Its time consuming and looks janky...)  Props to House of Thai for putting them on top!! The sauce was great and stuck to the noodles, which were cooked perfectly. The pad thai gets a solid '4 stars'. I knocked off a star because i had to add chicken ($) and there was no spice.\nWe also got the #1 Golden Bag appetizer which was my fave thing about the meal. There were 5 deep fried, crunchy bags of goodness each tied with its own little deep fried tie wrapped around the top. The presentation was cool. I should've snapped a pic but ate those little fuckers pretty quick. They're made with minced chicken with excellent flavor, tiny potato cubes and green onion. YUUUMMMMERS.\nThese golden bags get '5 stars' as they were the highlight of the meal. \nAlso ordered a side of jasmine rice and sticky rice--- upon recommendation from another reviewer,  we got a side of peanut sauce to dip the sticky rice into. Jasmine was okay--not great--and the sticky rice was tasty. Btw, i think this was your standard thai sticky rice. They also had mango sticky rice on the menu, but, I'm fairly certain this was not the mango variety.  It was very good dipped in the peanut sauce.\nOne note about the peanut sauce: i was expecting a usual little side of peanut sauce. What i got was a container of sauce which i actually saved for the next day. I think it was around $4. Next time I'll either get more things to dip or pour the sauce over, OR I'll ask for just a couple little condiment-sized peanut sauce containers, rather than a CUP of sauce. \n(*Note* I would've loved some chicken skewers to go with the peanut sauce but i didnt see it anywhere on the menu and forgot to ask.)\nThe bill came to $28 and change (tipped $6) so...$35 out the door: a bit pricey for one main dish, one appetizer and 2 sides of rice BUT i did add chicken and of course, my small vat of peanut sauce.\nNext time we're near the Loin and craving some quick, tasty morsels, I'll definitely remember House of Thai and make a few small adjustments to my order.

No, I'm not your long-lost Chinese grandmother who head-butts you on MUNI to get a seat. I just happened to like steamed chicken with a little minced garlic and ginger oil for dipping. I'm finally recognizing that I prefer it at old-school Chinese restaurants where I can get a whole chicken cut up and served that way versus Thai restaurants where they make it with less conviction, something that became clear when I tried this place out on the busy corner of Larkin and Geary in the Tenderloin. It's a bustling place in the early evening, but I managed to secure a table quite easily.\n\nGetting service once I sat down was more challenging, but the menu is fairly comprehensive so it took me a while to peruse it. I decided to order the $7 Por-Pier Sod, which sounded like a more carnivorous version of a spring roll since the thick rice paper wrapped Chinese sausage, egg, tofu and cucumber. I liked it enough since it had a nice crunch, although the gloopy sweet and sour tamarind sauce was ladled on far too thick to enjoy (photo: http://bit.ly/1cCGTGL). A proper peanut sauce positioned for optional dipping would have suited me just fine. For my entree, no surprise, I went for the $11 Kao Mun Kai.

I have visited Bangkok two times; and Chiang Mai in the North of Thailand once.  I thus  got to eat at the famous street food vendors, and mom and pop restaurants that proliferate these cities; and since both Bangkok and Chiang Mai are the food centers of Thailand, folks who have been to or lived in these two cities know what makes Thai food great.  Thus, Thai House Express is the most authentic Thai restaurant as it is very comparable to Thai food you'll find in Thailand.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the Green Curry Chicken is well balanced and alive with flavor in the coconut milk, and spices.  This reminded me of the green curry chicken I had prepared by a master chef in a cooking school in Chiang Mai (Northern Thailand).  Secondly, there is a southern thailand regional dish called 'Kha Nom Jeen' which is my favorite. It is fish curry with preserved vegetables over soft vermicelli rice noodles.  That dish reminds me everytime of the well reputed Siam Square food courts  in Bangkok.  Totally authentic, and every flavor as it should be.
