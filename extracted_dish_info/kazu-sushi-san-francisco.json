It's right in the neighborhood, and my wife and I knew it was on the slightly more expensive end of the spectrum. So we picked a special night and decided to give it a shot.\n\nFrom the good to the not-so-good:\n1) VERY fresh fish. The uni was as fresh as any my wife has ever had. The ikura was equally fresh, but we were surprised by how small they were. The maki rolls were very good as well, but a little on the small side; we ordered the rainbow roll (see #4 below) and another roll whose name escapes me: it's the roll that is the second one pictured by \"Daniel K\" in the photo gallery, the one with shrimp tempura on the inside. The toro nigiri almost seemed like it had been pre-frozen...there was something not quite right about its texture. I'm used to it practically melting in my mouth (when it's very good). Not so with our order.\n2) Overall, relatively high prices for relatively small portions...but we knew about the high prices going in.\n3) INCREDIBLY slow service, though this may be due to the fact that we were there on a Saturday evening in a packed little space. Both waitresses are very pleasant, but the guys behind the sushi bar could pick up the pace a little bit. I've never been to a sushi place in the city where there is so much time between served items. Ikura nigiri and toro nigiri arrive (this is really not much food, mind you). Twenty minutes later (no joke), a single maki roll arrives. Consumed in about five minutes. Fifteen minutes later, saba nigiri and hirame nigiri. 15-20 minutes later, another maki roll. At this point, I ask my wife \"Is this how the high-end sushi restaurants in Japan do it?\" No, it's not.\n4) We ordered a couple of maki rolls and several orders of nigiri sushi. Two items, the rainbow roll and the tai nigiri, had not even come to us when the waitress prematurely brought us our check. We were like \"Huh??!\" She proceeded to tell us \"oh, we are out of tai\" - umm, that info would have been useful more than an hour earlier when we placed our order (or any time between then and the time the bill arrived...prematurely). I asked \"What about the rainbow roll that we ordered?\" She was like \"Oh...I'm so sorry, did it not arrive? Let me go have that prepared\" to which I quickly responded with, \"Wait, how long is it going to take?? If it's going to take 20 minutes, we'll just pay now.\" The rainbow roll arrived in about 5 minutes; it was small but tasty, as expected...but our appetites was already on the way out the door.\n\nI agree with many of the reviewers who say this is probably one of the better sushi joints in SF (ONLY as far as quality of fish is concerned), but the negatives far outweigh the positives for us.

We ordered: negi-hama,  crunchy spicy  tuna roll, nigiri appetizer, kisu tempura, yakitori, chu-toro, and 2 orders of nigiri from their special menu. Our total was around $93 (including tax). o_O I know, right!? Hella expensive! But then again, the chu-toro sashimi my bf ordered was around $20 and he also had some sake.\n\nFish was VERY fresh! My 5 piece nigiri appetizer ($11)  was delicious! It came with unagi, sake, ebi, maguro, and hamachi. Soooo good! Haven't had super fresh fish in a while. That crunchy spicy tuna roll we ordered was surprisingly good! I don't really like ordering rolls like that but my bf wanted to try it. I'm not into those crazy rolls.  But they had some crazy rolls on the menu. I had to pass.  Anyway,  if the crunchy spicy tuna roll is still on their special menu, I highly recommended it. Its delicious! It wasn't even that spicy so I was still able to taste the freshness of the fish.\n\nAs for that chu-toro...it was my first time trying it. I thought it was pretty intense. Bf loved it.  Kisu tempura was good. Not too much batter. I still like the one at Rumble Fish better. Chicken yakitori was tasty. It was very tender and had a nice flavor.\n\nService was nice. My glass of water was always full. This place is also very small. So I'm sure it gets really crowded on a busy night. We got here around 6:30pm and it wasn't that crowded.  Oh and its Japanese owned. \n\nBtw, parking is a bitch around this area. We circled around for over 15 minutes and gave up.

Just had dinner here tonight, and it was quite good.  The chef has some skills!   Everything here was good, though the prices were a little high.  For instance, if a hamachi-kama (yellowtail jaw) is around $10, I expect to get the WHOLE jaw, not just 1 half.  However, the jaw was perfectly grilled/roasted shioyaki.  The gindara was excellent, black cod perfectly marinated with miso, however the serving size was not as large as Koo's, although the quality was comparable (I like koo's presentation better with the greens and \"soupy\" base).  The nanbanzuke was quite interesting--never had anything quite like it.  It was a fried fish (can't remember the name in english...I remember it was a spanish name starting with a vowel like E) that was marinated after it was fried, so is served cold in a slightly sour ponzu-like sauce, served with green onions and cilantro.\r\nMy favorite dish he made, however, was the hotate ayaburi (I think that was the name) tataki, served as nigiri sushi.  It was a seared scallop (hotate) with some scallions and ginger on top--the flavor balance was impeccable, as well as texturing and everything.  Quite awesome.  I would order LOTS more of this sushi.   Unfortunately, they were out of my favorite uni.  As raw fish goes, their king salmon was excellent (no tendons, well portioned, excellent cut), their amaebi was good--and the head was quite good, since they removed the main outer shell for you, making it a lot easier to eat.  Next time I will ask for it in a miso soup, and see if he'll prepare it that way for me ;).\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't order it, they did have a chirashi sushi here.  $22.  Not a bad price.  I'll have to get it next time, since my friend asked to have more maguro and sake than I personally need--I want to see what goodies it comes with.  The tamago, however, did not have the nicely carmellized layers like Kitsho did.  From what I saw, though, the fish all looked good.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be back to try some of the remaining items, which look interesting.  Definitely good food here.  The sake menu looks to be remnant of one of the old Chika sake menus, so the selection is not bad--though they lack a lot of the high end stuff chika had, like the kubota.  They still have some nice daiginjos and ginjos however--be sure to ask for the sake menu.\r\n\r\nThe chef, Miyauchi-san, is from ten-ichi in the fillmore.

The hamachi here is very tender and fresh, practicially melts in your mouth.

Twenty minutes later (no joke), a single maki roll arrives. Consumed in about five minutes. Fifteen minutes later, saba nigiri and hirame nigiri. 15-20 minutes later, another maki roll.

This is a traditional Japanese restaurant; mainly sushi and sushi rolls, and maybe a couple of entrees. \n\nThe fish was undoubtedly fresh, but not the best that I've had. From my experience, I think Ebisu has better quality fish. But anyhow, back to my review of Kazu!\n\n-Ankimo ($8.75): OMG THIS IS A MUST GET. 6 STARS OUT OF 5. Yes it is THAT good. They made this monk fish liver pate so smooth that it instantly melts in your mouth. The flavor is simply amazing and UUUGH I wanted more. The only down side is that it only comes with 3 pieces =/ it's slightly larger than most places, but still I think it is a bit overpriced for that little amount. But I would still get it next time just because it is SO FREAKIN AMAZING!\n\n-Fresh Aji ($8.95): definitely fresh! Did not have much taste to it but it is without a doubt quality fish\n\n-Fresh Uni ($7.95): fresh and amazing flavors! Again, very fresh and just the right amount of uni:rice ratio.\n\n-Moriawase ($25): cames with fresh salmon, albacore, saba, octopus, hamachi, kanpachi, and tuna. Like I said earlier, all the fish is extremely fresh! That was it though. For me, the quality is better than other sushi places, but not quite up there like Ebisu. (Sorry for comparing Kazu with Ebisu again)\n\n-Double Double ($12.50): \"Spicy salmon, avocado, and cucumber wrapped with fresh salmon and mango layers topped with spicy sesame chili sauce\". This was a very delicious roll! I would definitely order this again and I think you should give this a try too if you like salmon! It just has a hint of spice, so for the people out there who can't take spicy food like me, this should be fine for you (: \n\n-Hamachi Dragon ($13): it has shrimp tempura on the inside and hamachi/avocado on the outside.

Basically, if you are hungry and you're here with your friends, you're screwed in an unsatisfying way because you'll be left so hungry that you'd lick the bottom of any plate. My friend had been here a couple of times and suggested this place for dinner. Boy...we were disappointed.\n\nThe service was horrendous. We were a party of four and arrived at 6:30PM. We didn't have to wait very long for a table as they were clearing a table. The party in front of us (two kids) were sat maybe a minute or two before us. When did they get their food? Almost an hour and a half before ours. We sat there for about 15+ minutes before our order was taken. We sat there for 1+ hours while we waited for our order to arrive. One of our friend's roll came out about a little over an hour. Ours...twenty mins later. \n\nI will say that the rolls were tasty, but they added my friend's roll on my plate and when I tried to move it into another plate, the roll disassembled.

I came in with my husband for a romantic dinner. But from the very start, things were not enjoyable. \n\nWhen we walked in and stood with three other people in the crowded doorway, nobody greeted us, much less seated us, for at least ten minutes. It got  to the point where I thought we should just seat ourselves at one of the empty tables, except there was that one party ahead of us. I then whispered to my husband, if no one even greeted us in another ten minutes, we should leave. Finally, the one and only waitress there seats us. \n\nWe took our time looking at the menu because it seemed the waitress would take a long while before getting back to us. (The table next to us were ready to leave but were getting annoyed about not receiving their check after a long wait.) A look at the menu shows a very appetizing selection of rolls and nigiri. I ordered the spicy veggie tempura roll, and my husband the beef roll and saba shioyaki. \n\nWhile we're waiting for our food, we notice a couple of things that don't make sense. First, the dining area which was already crammed, was further shrunk by the huge shoji screen they placed at the front side of the bar. I realize they probably want to make a \"behind-the-scenes\" area for the sushi chef but it makes one feel a little claustrophobic. Second, AFTER we ordered our food, we then saw the \"Specials\" whiteboard which was sitting on a chair, facing only one of the tables. We later learned that they rotated the placement of this whiteboard as parties were seated and looking at the menu. But they didn't bother to show the specials to us, or maybe the smarter thing to do would be to just hang up the whiteboard so everyone can see! Hmm...what an idea. Lastly, it was freezing cold and they didn't have central air so they placed parabolic space heaters on the floor. It was a nice courtesy for the heat but it got in the way of getting to my seat and walking to the bathroom. One of the heaters was also placed so close to a tablecloth we thought it could be a fire hazard. \n\nWhen our food finally came twenty minutes later, which I think is considered fast for this place, we did a double take at the portion size. We had ordered two rolls but got only one plate with eight pieces on it. I seriously thought another plate was coming but to our disappointment, each roll was only four pieces! I mean, four-piece maki at those prices?! They tasted good, not amazing, but they were so NOT worth it. If you want vegetarian sushi at a more reasonable value, try Cha-ya. We've never been disappointed there. Also, my husband's saba shioyaki was ridden with bones. Not four or five, but almost wrapped in bones was how he described it.\n\nI think this place tries to be authentic and high quality but the execution of a fine dining experience just isn't there.

I didn't eat any of the rolls, mostly because I'm more of the traditional sushi eater, but they looked very appetizing. I tried the kuronama Asahi beer and it was really good. Goes well with sushi. The oyster was so fresh and I really enjoyed the ponzu and garnish.\n\nAt the end, we had squid ink ramen. Whoa, that was surprisingly delicious! Ramen usually uses pork broth, but since this was fish/squid ink based, it was so crisp. Loved it!\n\nI'd give it a 4.5 stars because there were many times that we wanted service, but it was difficult to get the waitress' attention. Cannot blame her though, she was working by herself and had to divide her attention between all the other customers.\n\nOverall, really nice restaurant.

Around here I've been to Koo and Ebisu besides Kazu.  Haven't been to Ten and Jimisan yet...but for some reason they do not tempt me much.  I'll get around to rating those other two one of these days...but Kazu was definitely one I liked the most of the three..  \n\nWhat impressed me the most and why i've been coming back about Kazu is the VARIETY.  The regular menu may seem okay..but check out the tiny white board they have for the specials and they have fish that i've rarely ever had...I've done Kohada, Aji, Sayori at other places and this place not only has these, but they have ebodai, kurodai, 2-3 different Toro, 2 types of ika, and a host of things I don't know but continue to try. Why I come back, maybe i've been watching too much \"Bizarre Foods\" lately... \n\nother pluses:\n-They give you a warm towel to clean your hands... like Yu Zen and Kappo Gomi.. instant plus to me.\n-Japanese owned... the chef seems well trained in his art.\n-The rice was a good portion and decently seasoned...and the dab of wasabi the sushi chef used was perfect.  \n-Good selection of cooked plates... again some pretty authentic items. I need to stop ordering the Nigiri and get some more of these tapas style plates.\n-they have a porter style Asahi...forgot what's it called..and comes in a frosted glass.\n\nCons:\n-the blue fin Otoro...was not otoro..at least the types i get a Yu Zen and Kappo Gomi (melt in your mouth pink type).  The portion here was big..but seems like it was half otoro and chutoro..i.e. right at the border maybe...and had some tendons.  \n-the other con as that i came on a Wednesday.. and the fish was good but lacked the uber freshness of the last two times...which were weekends..\n-One time the rice on the Nigiri fell apart... i think there's an apprentice in training.\n-small place..would not come here if you have more than 4 people.\n\nDespite the couple of negatives... overall food and experience were still great.

Thank you, come again! \n\nIf you want to know what's good on their appetizer and specials menu, please, keep reading. \n\nMy favorite thing of the entire evening was the Chicken karaage. They definitely use free range chicken for this dish. It's very tender and super juicy. They pour ponzu sauce over the chicken that is sitting on a bed of lettuce and thinly sliced red onion. After I ate the chicken, I ate the lettuce which was by that time, warm and drenched in ponzu. SO GOOD. \n\nMy second favorite thing was the shiobuta kakuni. This is a huge slice of thick salted pork belly that seems like it has been slow cooking for days and days. The fat, though still intact, melts on your tongue like warm butter. The meat is soft and flavorful. Usually, I cannot eat huge pieces of fat on a regular grilled pork belly. But this fat was much different and MUCH better. \n\nThe gyoza were awesome! I like that they put a little hot chili oil in the shoyu dipping sauce. \n\nThe tsukune were HUGE. Almost as big as tennis balls. But they lacked flavor, sadly. \n\nThe service is ok. Pretty slow. There's really only one server and she was running around like crazy alllllllll night. But other than that, no complaints.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-25"}, {"excerpts": ["/ Tsukune", "=chicken meatball skewer (w/salt), better than any yakitori restaurant i've been to in ages.

I've been there multiple times now and I've been satisfied every single time. Since I have been there often, these are the things i recommend new people that want to try Sushi Kazu out go/do.\n\n1) Ask for the specials of the day. It's usually on a white board near the entrance on the right. Kazu-san gets many types of fish that other sushi places never carry, and they are worth trying. Yum!\n\n2) Try to go on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. I've noticed that those are the off peak days for some reason and an early dinner (6-8pm) is a great time since they seat around  25-30 seats and you don't want to be there when it's packed. Less people = Faster service \n\n3) All the sushi are to die for but if you would like some appetizers to start with i recommend: \"Yakitori\" Momo=chicken skewer / Tsukune=chicken meatball skewer (w/salt), better than any yakitori restaurant i've been to in ages. \"Ankimo\"=Monkfish liver (cooked w/ponzu sauce i believe) Melts away in your mouth before you even know it. \n\n4) You must, and i say you must try a glass of the \"Takenotsuyu\"=Nihonshu=Sake. It's something like $9 a glass but boy  is it good!! I usually don't drink but even my buddies that love to drink all agree with me that this Sake is delicious. I tried to look for it everywhere in the Japanese supermarkets and other restaurants but it's no where to be found, so I get one or two of these glasses while i enjoy my food.\n\nI hope my review will help some people out that are looking for a great place to eat \"Real\" sushi.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-03-14"}], "teba": [], "yasai yaki": [], "saba misoni": [{"excerpts": ["The grilled sardines and saba misoni were very nice.\n\n"], "author": "Ben R.", "review": "Thanks to Danny @ Sebo for pointing out this place to me, as I had passed it many times before eating there.

The shari (rice component) was nicely seasoned with just the right sticky consistency while the neta (fish) was artistically cut and laid on top.

The unique combination of ingredients worked surprisingly well with one another. The buttery salmon and ripen avocado paired along with the mango slices and the spicy sesame sauce was a fiery umami sensation in my mouth. \n\nS E R V I C E\nKeeping with the traditional Japanese hospitality fashion, Kazu-San and staff were very welcoming and pleasant. \n\nSitting at the corner of the sushi bar did compromise service a bit as we had to flag down our waitress for things such as green tea refills. We were also charged with a roll we never received but it was quickly resolved after bringing it to their attention. Had the service been a tad more attentive, Kazu would have easily earned an extra star.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nSimple, clean, and casual, Kazu Sushi is where you come for the food and food only.

Maybe not. We went to Kazu Sushi in a group of 6 with empty stomachs on a Monday night. We left 2 hours later with our stomachs only half full and feeling very disappointed. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, it was still empty (with only two tables occupied) so the waitress was able to arrange a large table for us quickly. As we sat down and started looking at the menu, I asked the waitress for recommendations since we had a relatively large group. However, it became clear that the waitress didn't know the menu very well. She said \"I will try\" but was clearly struggling to come up with something interesting for us. Eventually, we ordered hamachi toro nigiri, beef tongue nigiri, grilled miso cod, tempura, some fancy version of agedashi tofu with crab meat (I forget the name), pork belly and some rolls. \n\nHamachi and beef tongue came first. The hamachi was very fresh and tasty, but it was so thinly sliced and laid over such a large clump of rice, that the taste of the rice overpowered the fish. I wished we had ordered sashimi instead so that I could fully enjoy the fish.\n\nMy friends were expecting some raw beef tongue, but what we got instead was some slow-cooked beef tongue over rice. The beef tongue tasted okay, but it was a bit dry on the edges, which was mostly because it had been pre-cut and left to sit uncovered for some time. \n\nThe pork belly was a huge disappointment. Not only was there just ONE small piece, but also the meat was very dry. Yes, we were served some dry fatty pork belly!\n\nThe agedashi tofu sauce was too thick and had too much ginger, and this is despite the fact that I love ginger. I was also disappointed that they did not use silken tofu. \n\nThe cod was cooked just right, but too salty.\n\nThe tempura was awful! Instead of getting the usual fluffy and crispy tempura, what we had was the exact opposite. The shrimp was small and overcooked, and the batter was soft. I would have returned the dish if my friends hadn't eaten them so quickly. \n\nThe rolls were okay, nothing very special and were a little bland. Maybe they would have tasted a little better if they hadn't come at an interval of 20 minutes each.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best and the service was ridiculous slow! It's true that the restaurant is small, with 7 tables plus a sushi bar, but it's not so small that it only needs one waitress. The restaurant filled up quickly after we sat down. The waitress was so busy taking care of other tables that she paid little attention to us. Our tea and hot water were only refilled once for the whole night. After numerous attempts to ask her to refill our cups, I finally asked her to give us a pot of tea and hot water so we could serve ourselves. It took her 10 minutes to bring us half a pot of hot water. The tea never came. \n\nWhile we were \"patiently\" waiting for our food to arrive, we overheard the couple next to us complaining about the freshness of their sashimi. They wanted to cancel their order, but the restaurant refused to do so. The couple ended up paying the full bill. After they left, I saw that their food (one sashimi platter and a couple rolls) was pretty much untouched. \n\nFed up with waiting 20 minutes between dishes, we left before we were full. \n\nIn a nutshell, Kazu Sushi is over-rated, over-priced, and under-staffed. \n\nThe best thing about the restaurant? The orchids displayed in the restroom.

It's right in the neighborhood, and my wife and I knew it was on the slightly more expensive end of the spectrum. So we picked a special night and decided to give it a shot.\n\nFrom the good to the not-so-good:\n1) VERY fresh fish. The uni was as fresh as any my wife has ever had. The ikura was equally fresh, but we were surprised by how small they were. The maki rolls were very good as well, but a little on the small side; we ordered the rainbow roll (see #4 below) and another roll whose name escapes me: it's the roll that is the second one pictured by \"Daniel K\" in the photo gallery, the one with shrimp tempura on the inside. The toro nigiri almost seemed like it had been pre-frozen...there was something not quite right about its texture. I'm used to it practically melting in my mouth (when it's very good). Not so with our order.\n2) Overall, relatively high prices for relatively small portions...but we knew about the high prices going in.\n3) INCREDIBLY slow service, though this may be due to the fact that we were there on a Saturday evening in a packed little space. Both waitresses are very pleasant, but the guys behind the sushi bar could pick up the pace a little bit. I've never been to a sushi place in the city where there is so much time between served items. Ikura nigiri and toro nigiri arrive (this is really not much food, mind you). Twenty minutes later (no joke), a single maki roll arrives. Consumed in about five minutes. Fifteen minutes later, saba nigiri and hirame nigiri. 15-20 minutes later, another maki roll. At this point, I ask my wife \"Is this how the high-end sushi restaurants in Japan do it?\" No, it's not.\n4) We ordered a couple of maki rolls and several orders of nigiri sushi. Two items, the rainbow roll and the tai nigiri, had not even come to us when the waitress prematurely brought us our check. We were like \"Huh??!\" She proceeded to tell us \"oh, we are out of tai\" - umm, that info would have been useful more than an hour earlier when we placed our order (or any time between then and the time the bill arrived...prematurely). I asked \"What about the rainbow roll that we ordered?\" She was like \"Oh...I'm so sorry, did it not arrive? Let me go have that prepared\" to which I quickly responded with, \"Wait, how long is it going to take?? If it's going to take 20 minutes, we'll just pay now.\" The rainbow roll arrived in about 5 minutes; it was small but tasty, as expected...but our appetites was already on the way out the door.\n\nI agree with many of the reviewers who say this is probably one of the better sushi joints in SF (ONLY as far as quality of fish is concerned), but the negatives far outweigh the positives for us.

Seriousness to the max.\n\nTheir ambience was quite \"Japanesie\" if I do say so myself. This is a traditional Japanese restaurant; mainly sushi and sushi rolls, and maybe a couple of entrees. \n\nThe fish was undoubtedly fresh, but not the best that I've had. From my experience, I think Ebisu has better quality fish. But anyhow, back to my review of Kazu!\n\n-Ankimo ($8.75): OMG THIS IS A MUST GET. 6 STARS OUT OF 5. Yes it is THAT good. They made this monk fish liver pate so smooth that it instantly melts in your mouth. The flavor is simply amazing and UUUGH I wanted more. The only down side is that it only comes with 3 pieces =/ it's slightly larger than most places, but still I think it is a bit overpriced for that little amount. But I would still get it next time just because it is SO FREAKIN AMAZING!\n\n-Fresh Aji ($8.95): definitely fresh! Did not have much taste to it but it is without a doubt quality fish\n\n-Fresh Uni ($7.95): fresh and amazing flavors! Again, very fresh and just the right amount of uni:rice ratio.\n\n-Moriawase ($25): cames with fresh salmon, albacore, saba, octopus, hamachi, kanpachi, and tuna. Like I said earlier, all the fish is extremely fresh! That was it though. For me, the quality is better than other sushi places, but not quite up there like Ebisu. (Sorry for comparing Kazu with Ebisu again)\n\n-Double Double ($12.50): \"Spicy salmon, avocado, and cucumber wrapped with fresh salmon and mango layers topped with spicy sesame chili sauce\". This was a very delicious roll! I would definitely order this again and I think you should give this a try too if you like salmon! It just has a hint of spice, so for the people out there who can't take spicy food like me, this should be fine for you (: \n\n-Hamachi Dragon ($13): it has shrimp tempura on the inside and hamachi/avocado on the outside. This roll was not my favorite, but it was still pretty decent. However, my boyfriend and my mom both liked this more than the double double, so idk...haha.

Konoshiro (adult kohada) was out of this world, uni, shimesaba (splendid marination receipe, with great salt and vinegar balance), aji, hirame, suzuki, mirugai. The good stuff. Prices aren't too far off from Ino, but you do get what you pay for. Going crazy on the white board a la carte ordering will co$t you, which is why some of you prefer to do the \"let the chef sock it to me baby\" style ordering to sample, maybe fill up by getting a burger outside afterwards and save a few more buckeroo$.\n\n- the jive ass rolls here look extremely erotic (but I didn't partake).

Just had dinner here tonight, and it was quite good.  The chef has some skills!   Everything here was good, though the prices were a little high.  For instance, if a hamachi-kama (yellowtail jaw) is around $10, I expect to get the WHOLE jaw, not just 1 half.  However, the jaw was perfectly grilled/roasted shioyaki.  The gindara was excellent, black cod perfectly marinated with miso, however the serving size was not as large as Koo's, although the quality was comparable (I like koo's presentation better with the greens and \"soupy\" base).  The nanbanzuke was quite interesting--never had anything quite like it.  It was a fried fish (can't remember the name in english...I remember it was a spanish name starting with a vowel like E) that was marinated after it was fried, so is served cold in a slightly sour ponzu-like sauce, served with green onions and cilantro.\r\nMy favorite dish he made, however, was the hotate ayaburi (I think that was the name) tataki, served as nigiri sushi.  It was a seared scallop (hotate) with some scallions and ginger on top--the flavor balance was impeccable, as well as texturing and everything.  Quite awesome.  I would order LOTS more of this sushi.   Unfortunately, they were out of my favorite uni.  As raw fish goes, their king salmon was excellent (no tendons, well portioned, excellent cut), their amaebi was good--and the head was quite good, since they removed the main outer shell for you, making it a lot easier to eat.  Next time I will ask for it in a miso soup, and see if he'll prepare it that way for me ;).\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't order it, they did have a chirashi sushi here.  $22.  Not a bad price.  I'll have to get it next time, since my friend asked to have more maguro and sake than I personally need--I want to see what goodies it comes with.  The tamago, however, did not have the nicely carmellized layers like Kitsho did.  From what I saw, though, the fish all looked good.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be back to try some of the remaining items, which look interesting.  Definitely good food here.  The sake menu looks to be remnant of one of the old Chika sake menus, so the selection is not bad--though they lack a lot of the high end stuff chika had, like the kubota.  They still have some nice daiginjos and ginjos however--be sure to ask for the sake menu.\r\n\r\nThe chef, Miyauchi-san, is from ten-ichi in the fillmore.

We went to Kazu Sushi in a group of 6 with empty stomachs on a Monday night. We left 2 hours later with our stomachs only half full and feeling very disappointed. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, it was still empty (with only two tables occupied) so the waitress was able to arrange a large table for us quickly. As we sat down and started looking at the menu, I asked the waitress for recommendations since we had a relatively large group. However, it became clear that the waitress didn't know the menu very well. She said \"I will try\" but was clearly struggling to come up with something interesting for us. Eventually, we ordered hamachi toro nigiri, beef tongue nigiri, grilled miso cod, tempura, some fancy version of agedashi tofu with crab meat (I forget the name), pork belly and some rolls. \n\nHamachi and beef tongue came first. The hamachi was very fresh and tasty, but it was so thinly sliced and laid over such a large clump of rice, that the taste of the rice overpowered the fish. I wished we had ordered sashimi instead so that I could fully enjoy the fish.\n\nMy friends were expecting some raw beef tongue, but what we got instead was some slow-cooked beef tongue over rice. The beef tongue tasted okay, but it was a bit dry on the edges, which was mostly because it had been pre-cut and left to sit uncovered for some time. \n\nThe pork belly was a huge disappointment. Not only was there just ONE small piece, but also the meat was very dry. Yes, we were served some dry fatty pork belly!\n\nThe agedashi tofu sauce was too thick and had too much ginger, and this is despite the fact that I love ginger. I was also disappointed that they did not use silken tofu. \n\nThe cod was cooked just right, but too salty.\n\nThe tempura was awful! Instead of getting the usual fluffy and crispy tempura, what we had was the exact opposite. The shrimp was small and overcooked, and the batter was soft. I would have returned the dish if my friends hadn't eaten them so quickly. \n\nThe rolls were okay, nothing very special and were a little bland. Maybe they would have tasted a little better if they hadn't come at an interval of 20 minutes each.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best and the service was ridiculous slow! It's true that the restaurant is small, with 7 tables plus a sushi bar, but it's not so small that it only needs one waitress. The restaurant filled up quickly after we sat down. The waitress was so busy taking care of other tables that she paid little attention to us. Our tea and hot water were only refilled once for the whole night. After numerous attempts to ask her to refill our cups, I finally asked her to give us a pot of tea and hot water so we could serve ourselves. It took her 10 minutes to bring us half a pot of hot water. The tea never came. \n\nWhile we were \"patiently\" waiting for our food to arrive, we overheard the couple next to us complaining about the freshness of their sashimi. They wanted to cancel their order, but the restaurant refused to do so. The couple ended up paying the full bill. After they left, I saw that their food (one sashimi platter and a couple rolls) was pretty much untouched. \n\nFed up with waiting 20 minutes between dishes, we left before we were full. \n\nIn a nutshell, Kazu Sushi is over-rated, over-priced, and under-staffed. \n\nThe best thing about the restaurant?

Everything we had was wonderful, including 2 dishes that just appeared at our table, compliments of the house. (New restaurant = trying harder to get you to come back.) The first of these was two grilled sardines, with a little piquant sauce of some kind, diced green onion, and shiso (?) strands - very  tasty. The second freebie was delivered to our table by the sushi chef himself, along with 2 shots of a sake he thought would compliment the dish (he was right).
