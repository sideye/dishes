"], "author": "Paul T.", "review": "In a cavalier moment, I might be heard to say that this place is better than Chez Panisse;  it certainly produced the \"Wow\" moments that never came at Berkeley's famed bistro.  But let's be honest:  Chez Panisse has an epic reputation and the diner goes in with fantastic expectations;  Albona is about as unknown as its facade is unremarkable, and if I had any expectations at all, this close to the tomato-based spaghetti joints of North Beach, they weren't all that great.\n\nYet let's also note what other Yelpers have:  This place is as expensive as Chez Panisse and any other culinary temple of San Francisco, so those who have noted the expense aren't out of place;  entrees are in the mid to high twenties.\n\nThe food was very, very good.  It was closer in character to the tomato rich spaghetti dives nearby, than to Cotogna over in Jackson Square, which is a bit more modern in its take on Tuscany, and we left thinking as we did on leaving Cotogna, what a good meal we had.  I'm not having such moments as often as I'd like, given the expense of dining out.\n\nI'd ordered the braised sauerkraut with onions;  and the sardines with glazed onions, red wine vinegar, golden raisins and pine nuts (served chiled); and for an entree---being utterly uninspired by anything else (which at the moment all looks delicious) the \"Strudel con pasta fatta in casa\"  ($42. already, and that was just me, without the opening cocktail, and wine).    \n\nThe strudel is described as pasta rolls filled with prosciutto and lappi cheese, baked with a crumb crust, bechamel and tomato sauce.  I ordered it more out of curiosity but it was really quite the item.  Mild, rich without overdoing it;   Others had the fish stew, venison, and veal, which was labeled \"Stinco de videl a la Triestina\"   Strudel and stinco.  How can you go wrong?\n\nWe'd stumbled across this place while walking back from the Wharf a few months back and had wanted to go back.  The old post-1906 facade gives no hints, and only has a tiny window.  Inside it's a bit dark, and somewhat fussily comfortable, like a relative's house---gramps came over on the boat.  We were clearly the youngest people there---even with me and the partner having twenty years over our friends.  It was not painfully quiet---which I would hate.  People talked but didn't have to yell to be heard, so the ambience was nice.\n\nTo me the place seems a bit old fashioned in appearance and food, without being stale or held back by some dogma of the owner.   It's a lot better than most of the other places in North Beach, and different than Cotogna, different but good.\n\nI'd think this would be a great date place (unless your date has a thing for older people, you shouldn't have to worry about distractions) or for anniversaries.  But don't let the idea of special occasions hold you back. I'd go eat here anytime.\n\nAnd oh yes, the service was spot on, very friendly without trying to join your party.

"], "author": "Steph C.", "review": "My college friends and I took a trip up to San Francisco and me and another food freak in our group were tasked with finding a restaurant that would take a party of six on a Saturday with a day's notice.  After much scrambling on Yelp and Opentable, we booked the single available opening at Albona and hoped for the best.\n\nAll six of our party walked away from that meal fulfilled and happy.  I could not have asked for more from this restaurant in terms of warmth and authenticity and spectacular food.\n\nThe place is family-run and comfortably established, and the owner - a nephew or other close relative of the original owner - works the phone line, the host station, and the dining room with genuine affability and an obvious love of the restaurant.  I spoke with him on the phone about four times making various small changes to our reservation (parties of 5 - no 6 - no 5 - no 6 - are hard to manage) and by the time we met in person he treated me like a familiar, without a hint of annoyance.  Our waiter was similarly friendly and charming, as well as attentive and helpful.  The service was really wonderful.  Our waiter had clear favorites on the menu and led us in the right directions with our food.\n\nAnd sweet Saint Francis of Assisi, the food.  Albona is an Istrian restaurant, the only one I've been to or even heard of, and it's named for the original owner's hometown in Istria.  The cuisine is regional Italian, but with influences from Austrians, Hungarians, Greeks, you name it.  If I come across another Istrian restaurant, I'm going in, no questions asked.\n\nFirst off, the bread basket was great - the sourdough had a nice thick crust and the rolls were soft and ideal for sopping.  There was plenty of sopping when we'd cleared any hint of solid food off our two appetizer plates.  If you're going to listen to anything in this review, let it be this: \"chifeleti de mia nona con sugo de carne al cum\u00edn.\"  This was the original owner's grandmother's specialty - pan-fried potato gnocchi in a cumin-laced brown sirloin sauce.  It was insane.  The gnocchi was fried a just-crispy golden-brown on the outside and stayed impossibly fluffy and potatoey inside.  The sauce was deep and hearty with an aromatic trail of cumin.  Everyone wanted more, and everyone took bread to sauce to clean the plate.  We had a similar experience with the strudel con pasta fatta in casa, a fresh pasta roll stuffed with prosciutto and Lappi cheese, then baked in a casserole with toasted bread crumbs, b\u00e9chamel, and a tomato-cream sauce.  Does that sound decadent?  Because it was.  It was creamy and rich and over-the-top delicious.\n\nAfter those appetizers, you would think it all went downhill, but the entrees were excellent.  Being good friends and Asian and all, our group went semi-family style and everything was superb.  The winner among winners was the lombo de aniel ai feri - the grilled lamb noisette marinated in red wine, olive oil, vinegar, fresh herbs, and mint.  I've never had lamb so tender, and the generous forward application of fresh herbs was among the best I've ever encountered.  I was skeptical about the use of mint, but it was the icing on the cake - just a tiny hint that was noticeable but beautifully in tune.  The lamb was served with simple saut\u00e9ed vegetables and roasted potatoes which were homey and well-cooked.\n\nMy order was the brodeto de pesse a la Istriana, an Adriatic seafood stew with red wine and balsamic-tomato sauce, served over grilled polenta.  This was not as good as the meatier dishes, but it was still awesome, loaded with shrimp, mussels, and calamari, with earthy grilled polenta to soak up the sauce.\n\nOf the other entrees, I would recommend the arosto de coniglio, sugo in agrodolce con ginepro.  In English, this is braised rabbit with onions, juniper berries, honey, brown sugar, and balsamic, served with polenta.  The rabbit just fell off the bone, and the sauce was divine, with complex developed flavors.  The stinco de videl a la Triestina, a braised veal shank glazed with Burgundy wine and rosemary, was good, but it paled next to the braised rabbit.  If you need your chicken, the peto de polo a la Maraska was a decent sauteed bird breast in a fantastic brandied cherry sauce with whole cherries.  It also came with a gorgeous herb risotto.\n\nFor dessert, we split the panna cotta and a trio of chocolate, strawberry, and mandarin sorbet.  The panna cotta was simple and delicious, with a coulis of port wine and berries.  It was laden with vanilla bean and boasted a smooth thick texture.  The sorbets were all very light and feathery, almost icy but not unpleasantly so.  The desserts were more familiar than the savory fare, but we did well not to skip them.\n\nThe bill was worthy of a nice dinner out but even with wine, it was reasonable, especially given the A+ dining experience.  We were all full and happy when we boarded the trolley back to our hotel.

I had my doubts because most of the Italian joints in this neighborhood are extremely touristy and overhyped. While Albona was a cute, traditional place for dinner, it wasn't a destination and catered alot to the older crowd. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the 5 star reviews came from loyal neighborhood patrons, because the service was so wonderful. Perhaps if you are one of those Noe Valley Italian Restaurant 5-star reviewers, you may like this as well.\n\nIt was my anniversary, and the manager brought out complimentary champagne. He offered complimentary dessert also when I made the reservation over the phone (they're hard to get a hold of!), but dessert already came with my Travelzoo Voucher ($69 for 3-courses for 2 people - what a steal!). Surprisingly, there were no restrictions on the menu for which 3 courses to select. Typically, restaurants will limit you to the lower priced items and/or make you share dishes. Great deal but note: they include tax/gratuity on the full price of the meal. \n\nI was disappointed with the quality of the food overall, if I were to return it would merely be to rule out some potential dishes I didn't try. Some things I wish I had ordered instead were the mussels (appetizer), rabbit, any pasta, chocolate flan and panna cotta. \n\n* COMPLIMENTARY BREAD ROLLS (2 STARS):\nNo points docked here, I'll take free carbs any day! The rolls were however quite a disappointment, they felt warm but stale like they were store bought, a bit stale and reheated in the microwave. The hard butter tore this roll apart.\n\n* CALAMARI AL FORNO CON SALSA MARINARA (2 STARS) - $12: \nThree medium sized squid, stuffed with toasted bread crumbs, parsley, and garlic; roasted in marinara sauce. I squeezed the stuffing out, did not like the bread crumb heavy stuffing and the sauce tasted very... prego like. Overall I was very disappointed because I love squid!\n\n* CAPUZI GARBI CON PROSUTO E LUGANEGA (2.5 STARS) - $12: \nBraised sauerkraut with onions, apples and prosciutto with 3 halves of italian sausage. The waiter recommended against this because it has a strong pickled flavor, but I couldn't resist because I love sausage! I thought the sausage was OK, salty and dense - underwhelming for $12. I much prefer Rosamunde's ovepriced dogs.\n\n* COSTOLETTE DE ANIEL (4 STARS) - $30:\nRack of Lamb with Dijon mustard & herb crust served with a potato, eggplant and pesto napoleon. I enjoyed the rack of lamb, at a price point of $30 I would definitely get it again considering the famed Kokkari rack costs a whopping $42, although it is still not cheap. \n\n* INVOLTIN DE PORCO CON CAPUZI GARBI E PROSUTO (2 STARS) - $27:\nPork loin stuffed with sauerkraut, prosciutto, apples, and plums served with red cabbage saut\u00e9. The pork was a bit salty, dry... nothing about this was redeeming except it was a decently sized portion that could fill you up. \n\n* STRUDEL DE POMI (2 STARS) - $8:\nApple strudel with cinnamon, pine nuts, and golden raisins with vanilla ice cream (plus $3 = $11). This dessert was OK, but reminded me of the frozen desserts at Safeway that you bake at home, or a buffet. Supposedly these are all homemade desserts but I was quite unimpressed, perhaps it would have been better with a flaky butter crust instead?\n\n* TIRAMISU (2 STARS) - $8:\nThis tiramisu was soaked way too much in rum.

Oh so is this Croatian? Or is this a mix of Italian and Croatian and a billion other things because apparently there's strudels and saeurkraut on the menu\" - thoughts that ran in my head as I read the menu) Either way, the food here is good. Really good. Creepily good. Fantastically majestically good. \n\nIt was my mother's birthday and I had a reservation at \"Perbacca\" for a while until I last minute decided that it wasn't going to be her style. After doing some yelp-soul-searching, I discovered upon Albona and made a quick reservation for the night. We were lucky to find a parking rather quickly and descended upon this restaurant quickly as it was freezing outside. \n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\nIt was a small, intimate restaurant; not overly fancy but not too casual. The atmosphere was...I would say \"'polite\" but can you describe a restaurant as polite? There was classical music playing softly in the background which my dad absolutely loved. We're all classical music junkies in our family and it is rare to find a restaurant to be playing that. \n\nWHAT WE ORDERED:\n\nseasonal soup of the day (mushroom): I'm not a fan of mushroom. Like I will throw up if I even smell it. So...I didn't touch this. However, my mother (an avid mushroom lover - yack!) raved over this. Apparently, this mushroom soup was the best she's ever tasted.\n\ncalamai al forno con salsa marinara: squid stuffed with white fish, toasted bread crumbs, parsley, and garlic; roasted in marinara sauce. My god. This stuff is amazing. I'm used to eating fried calamari with marinara sauce and scarfing it down like a lunatic. This squid was fresh, chewy, NOT fried, stuffed with a delicious goodness of fish that didn't taste like fishy fish, it tasted like oh-this-is-good-what-is-this-magic fish mixed with other magical ingredients. One of my favorite dishes of the night.\n\ncatch of the day (halibut): this was my mother's order. I'm not quite too fond of halibut so I only had a bite or two. It was refreshing, light, and really well prepared. The execution was impressive because I feel like fish can go so wrong (maybe I just have bad experiences with smelly fishy fish and overcooked salmon).\n\nStrudel con pasta fatta in casa: I ordered this based on the rave reviews on Yelp. I normally wouldn't order this - prosciutto and lappi cheese in a pasta roll? That sounded a little too much, too rich for me. However, I ventured out of my comfort zone to try it. The strudel was definitely delicious and tasty, however I found it to be slightly too salty for my taste. It overwhelmed my taste buds and it was much too rich for me to finish by myself. I ate like about half of it and then boxed it for home. \n\nCostolette de Aniel: this was my dad's order and it was hands down, no argument here, the best dish of the night. It was a Rack of Lamb with Dijon mustard & herb crust served with a potato, eggplant and pesto napoleon. The lamb was perfectly executed and the best lamb I have ever tasted in the history of ever. My dad agreed and oh, boy, he has eaten a LOT of lamb. The sauce was perfect - very tasty without being overly salty. And the potatoes...ohhhhh the potatoes...\n\nstrudel de pomi: I always look forward to dessert, me being the sweet tooth that I am. Looking at the menu, i was quite disappointed with the selection, seeing nothing that looked particularly intriguing. I checked handy dandy Yelp and found that most people ordered the apple strudel. So, the strudel we got! And oh the strudel we loved. It wasn't mind blowingly phenomenal but it was good. Really good. The strudel was sweet and tart at the same time, warm and comforting. The gelato on the side was a nice touch (though definitely not worth the extra $3!)\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience. The waiters were attentive and friendly, always making sure our water was filled even though we had the bottle on our table. The ambiance was cozy and intimate.

But, this is a family operation and Michael, that's there hands-on every day, is awesome and will make sure you have the best service. \n\nI love this place.\n\nA San Francisco classic.

Seeing a 4.5 star review on yelp set this place up for great expectations.  \n\nLet me start off by saying, we did have a very nice time.  The waiters were great and spent time telling us about their favorite wine pairings and attending to us nicely.  The atmosphere was cozy and relaxed.\n\nThe main disappointment must have been the veal that both boys ordered - it was a sadly presented sliver of meat that left much to be desired.  this was served with a side of sauteed mushrooms that also screamed for want of taste.\n\nOther dishes were decent: the 4 pieces of lamb chops were done just right with a nice stack of eggplant/potato acompaniment.  I wasn't in ecstasy over them though and I would have liked to be for $27.  The veal shank over polenta was probably the best dish on the table: a generous, tasty hunk of meat.\n\nFor starters, we tried both risottos: mushroom and prosciutto - both were good, but a little firmer than I like my risotto - both the half and full portions are good sizes, but then again, you're paying entree price for the full.  The soup of the day was a blended asparagus - this I enjoyed.  The fresh bread on the table was good and I liked the texture of the whipped butter - nice and light.  \n\nDessert was a major let down: the strudel de pomi was an unexciting slab of slightly dried out apples in a non-descript crust with a ball of ice cream for $10+. Boo.\n\nAnyway, with the $25 coupon, each of the 4 of us paid $50 for: wine, appetizer, entree, shared dessert and tax and tip.  Slightly overpriced in my opinion.  I would like to try the stuffed pork loin and linguini but I don't know if I really need to go back to this place with so many other places to try.

Although it may be too pungent for some, I specifically enjoyed the truffle vinaigrette in the picia salad.  \n\nFor my main entree I ordered the Polo impana con salsa de capori, a pan-seared breaded chicken dish.

Dining. Experience. EVER.  Unique.  Memorable.  Unforgettable.  Exceptional.  Simply remarkable and sensational on every level you could imagine.\n  \nLocated off the beaten path, Albona was recommended by a friend of a friend.  I knew I HAD to dine here before leaving San Francisco.  I called first to make reservations and was told they were 'full'.  Nothing available.  I explained to the courteous man on the phone that I was from Chicago, heard great things about their restaurant, and that I was only in town for 1 more day.  I left my phone # and asked to be called in the event a table was available.\n\nI received a call later from the Manager the same day stating he had a table for 2 available as he was informed I was from Chicago and that he was more than happy to accommodate me. The conversation alone left a fond impression on me.  I was ecstatic to say the least and had no expectations going in...I was told this was a restaurant to check out, but never imagined the treasure I was about to discover.  I thought this was Italian, when in fact this cuisine is a combination of Italy, Croatia & Slovania known as Istrian.  \n\nWe cabbed it to Albona and upon entering the unassuming building off a quiet side street, I was taken by the very intimate and charming room.  It was rather small, but very comfortable.  My friend & I were seated immediately.  The waiter was outstanding.  As I stared at the menu consisting of everything 'tempting', I wanted to know what their specialty was.  What is on or off the menu that I should try?  (I always ask for suggestions whenever I'm 'new' to a cuisine).\nHe offered wonderful recommendations, including various wines.  This waiter was charming, engaging...and my girlfriend & I were thoroughly enjoying the banter...and flirting..\n\nAppetizer:  Grandmother's homemade fried potato gnocchi in a brown meat sauce w/cumin. Calamari al forno (stuffed w/bread crumbs) in marinara.  Before receiving our app's, the manager came over to greet us, and poured our wine.  He was so friendly, we couldn't stop talking as he came to check on us often...we loved his attention..(he was really, really cute too...I could literally just talk about *him*, but...) onto the food.  The gnocchi was nothing like a traditional pasta gnocchi.  These were more like round morsels of fried dough.  Very much like pieces of panzerotti dough made with potatoes (that's exactly what this reminded me of).  In fact, I even mentioned this to Mike (Manager).  He smiled when I said that, but wasn't going to 'give away any secrets'.  They were divine as was the complimenting sauce.  The squid was delicious as well.  Tenderly filled sitting in a tasty tomato sauce.\n\nFor entree's I went with the signature, Strudel con pasta fatta in casa (homemade).  Friend had the risotto con funghi.  Both were Mike's recommendation.  The strudel was much like a 'rotolo'. Baked with layers of lappi cheese, b\u00e9chamel, prosciutto, & tomato cream sauce.  Amazingly good.  The risotto was cooked perfectly.  Every dish was outstanding.\n\nAfter indulging in deliciousness and a bottle of wine later, Mike came by to bring us complimentary dessert...he asked what we'd like to have.  I was stuffed at this point and couldn't eat another bite, but he insisted.  He came back with 3 different desserts!!! Tiramisu, Bonet & Gelato.  All heavenly (not to mention Mike..;)  It was probably around 10 or 11pm as he sat with us, bringing out more wine, aperitif's, etc...etc...and the restaurant was now empty.  He was closing up, but yet we stayed - he insisted.  We weren't complaining. And the night went on, and on, and on..till around 1am!....we exchanged emails (yes, that's all we exchanged...sadly..).  \n\nI will never forget Albona's or Mike.

Very good and light, with a fresh seafood taste. Sweet onions and raisins offset the vinegar marinade nicely. The fish itself was a little dry.\n\n-Tomatoes in reduced balsamic - An offf-menu special that was basically beefsteak tomato slices in a reduced balsamic sauce, which was slightly sweet. Nice and refreshing, and was nice beside the sardines. A little simple, but delightful.\n\nMain Courses (which I sampled):\n\nCostolette de aniel - Mustard and herb crusted lamb, with potato and eggplant and pesto napoleon. The lamb was perfectly cooked, with the crust adding good crunch against the soft meat. There was a bit more fat on the lamb than I find ideal, leaving me with a forkful of fat no matter how I sliced it in the end. Despite being simple in appearance, the potato and eggplant side had all the flavor of lovingly roasted home cooked vegetables. This was my entree. \n\nPaired with:  Petite Sirah - EOS '06 Reserve - (Paso Robles, CA). I'm afraid I'm not a wine connoisseur, but this was a nice dry red wine, with some berry flavor I think, and it complimented the meal nicely. \n\nPenne a la \"arrabbiata\" - Tomatoes in spicy garlic butter and basil sauce over penne. I only had a small sample of this dish. The penne was dangerously close to being undercooked, and the sauce was a bit strong. To be fair, I was tasting it after the fatty lamb, so I probably got an unpleasant blast of acid flavor comparatively. My girlfriend, who had the dish, enjoyed it.\n\nPeto de polo a la Maraska - chicken breast in brandied Marasaka cherry sauce served with herb risotto. Again, I only had a mouthful of this dish. The chicken was moist, cooked perfectly, and the sauce had nice sweetness. The risotto was cooked perfectly, and to quote Iron Chef, \"It's like someone opened my mouth and stuffed a fistful of herbs in it.\" A burst of surprising flavor, along with a perfect texture. \n\nDessert: \n\nBonet - Amaretto flan. A delicious flan. Nothing else need be said.\n\nCrema de gelato - Triple cream gelato mousse with Marasaka cherries. I had this, despite the fact I know I don't like gelato or mousse. The cherries were delicious, and the gelato was good as well, with a nice coffee flavor. \n\nWine: MOSCATO d'ASTI - (Piemonte) - Michele Chiarlo, Nivole '06.

Thanks to our Yelp reviewers we found it and were very impressed.  We shared their Chifaleti as an appetizer - plentiful to share and very flavorful.  We ordered the Strudel con Pasta and the Involtin de Porco - both were fantastic.  I'm not a big sauerkraut person, but my oh my, the Involtin made me a believer.\n\nThis is not your typical Italian restaurant - as it has some middle European flare.  We finished our night with fresh delicious biscotti.\n\nThe waiter was kind enough to take us to the kitchen to meet the chef and his wife - such pleasant and unassuming people.

I dont know why you need to on a thursday night, but just make one. =) many people started coming in around 7pm.\n\nthis is a really small place. the ambiance and decor is really nice. its perfect for nice family gatherings (quiet) or for dates. =)\nservice was awesome and very attentive.\n\nok its food time!\nso i got a Strudel con pasta fatta in casa. this is a baked dish and comes with pasta rolls filled with thin slice of prosciutto & lappi cheese covered in bechamel & tomato-cream sauce. it said it has bread crumbs on it..but i didnt taste it. hahaha. the dish looked small, but it was quite filling. i got sick of it after the first half because i normally dont like or eat ham..and all the cheese was a bit overwhelming for me. the sauces and pasta itself were delicious! I felt like i could have make this dish..it wasnt anything special to me. My taste buds are a bit different, but I think the general public would love this dish.\n\nhalibut special: the halibut was tasty and cooked just right. it was absolutely amazing . i wish i got that instead of the baked dish. (and halibut is my favorite fish) I can still taste it in my mouth..deeelliicccious! it also comes with steamed veggies. \nWarning: if youre a big eater, i suggest you get something else..this was not enough for my friend.\n\nmushroom risotto was yummy, but i also got sick of it very quickly. my bf and i ended up finishing each other dishes in the end. I am a big fan of mushrooms and it was juicy and tasty! i could have eaten 1 lb of them or more. hahaha. the rice seemed not fully cooked to me..but im so use to asian rice.. it was kind of hard, but i had to chew it to get the full flavor of it.\n\nI dont quite agree with what everyone says. i have had better italian food before, I just wasnt satisfied with Albona. although, i did enjoy their fresh baked breads and their fresh butter!!!! i could have ate those and the mushrooms all night long. hahaha\n\none more thing to point out....as I was getting change, I was standing near the kitchen. and someone had ordered the biscotti and I saw the waiter take out a pretty, gold box and popped 3 biscottis on a dinky, beautiful plate and served it with elegance. I HATE RESTAURANTS WHO DO THAT. I know the biscottis were probably glorious, but the menu does say HOMEMADE DESSERTS.. not good to cheat your customers.\n\nWarning: if youre a big eater, this place WILL NOT fill you up. \n\n- a full strudel was 17 \n-a full mushroom risotto was 17\n- halibut special is probably around 20 something.\n( i paid 22 total including tip and tax)\n\ni believe our bill was around 86 dollars.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-07-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I would recommend the chocolate torte made with ricotta cheese in a biscotti crust.\n\n"], "author": "Lynn S.", "review": "Rave reviews for Bruno and family who operate this lovely gem of a restaurant decorated like a simple European country inn tucked away on a residential street in North Beach off the main strip.\n\nMy sea bass was served  luxuriating in the most wonderful sauce!
