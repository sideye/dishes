In Los Angeles, I subsisted on Papa Johns for pretty much my entire stay (except for the occasional Domino's trip because it is just so damned cheap!).\n\nThat said, I found Irving Pizza while wandering around my hotel, late at night, after my first day at my new job.  I was afraid nothing was going to be open.  To my delight, I caught a flash of light reflecting off their street sandwich-board.  I got a slice of pepperoni, and all was well in the world.  \n\nI've since tried their what I am going to call supreme and their Canadian bacon with pineapple.  All hit the spot.  \n\nMy only concern is about how long the pies are sitting out before a slice or two are lucky enough to find a new home.  But, I never worry about that for very long.\n\nFYI.  One slice is usually enough, and two is always too many.
