For starters, if you didn't realize it by now or if you just started reading my reviews, I'm really adamant about being a planner. Weekend getaways, date night, family trip, happy hours after work, etc...I'm normally the one choosing where. This was one of the rare times I let someone else take the reigns and go. Not only in choosing the place, but in choosing the entire menu for the dinner. NO. REGRETS. \n\nOur friend recommended Bar Crudo and after fighting the horrendous parking situation (seriously, Lyft if you can!), we walked into the bustling, busy restaurant. We ordered rounds of fresh oysters, mussels, shishito peppers, seafood chowder, uni toast, manila clams, the crudo sampler, and this crab head thing that we're going to call Crab Butter Thing (I'll explain shortly). \n\nThe chowder was incredibly rich and the mussels were delish! I loved the manila clams because they were prepared in a white wine sauce which is exactly how I prefer them. The uni toast was crunchy and crispy and went well against the creamy uni! As for the crudo, if you don't know what crudo is, it's pretty much like sashimi, presented in different ways with different flavors the way you would prepare poke. Since we got the sampler, we had a little bit of everything. The servers recommend you eat it in a certain order, from lightest in flavor to heaviest. Our favorite was the Tombo Tuna because of the bright citrusy flavors! \n\nNow onto the dish of the night...the crab butter thing. It wasn't on the menu, but our friend said it was last time he came, so he asked if they had the \"crab heads with the stuff inside\" (LOL this is verbatim!!). They happily brought it out for us because they said they just forgot to add it to that nights menu. The crab is served cold and you dip the bread into the decadent insides and it's heaven. I've eaten that part of the crab before, but I don't know what it is that they add into it that makes it so amazing.

The clam chowder is not New England style. It has a few pieces of 2-3 pieces of clams, potato, crab, and chicken (?). Cod tacos are DELICIOUS and the guacamole in there is amazing! The crudo for 2 included 2 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of scallops sliced into 4 pieces total, salmon with wasabi eggs, and butterfish (so soft!). \n\nNext time, I would stick to 6 oysters, a plate for tacos, and maybe a clam chowder (just for me).\n\nParking can be easy or it can be tricky. \nSeating, make reservations if possible. There is also an upstairs seating too!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-07-01"}, {"excerpts": ["We also had oysters which were so fresh and delicious with many choices including some of my favs. ", "We also had the red snapper wish was lovely and light.

I have a preference for salty things but this was a bit overboard. When asked if I enjoyed everything, I mentioned how salty the toast was and received a pretty indifferent response.

Located on Divisadero Street and central to your foodie 3 blocks radius, this is a good place to grab some seafood.  \n\nParking can be a difficult cat and mouse game, and praying for the parking gods can turn something up... but when dining in Divisadero (north of the panhandle district), one must remember to bring coins, sharp eyes, and be ready to chow down with any restaurants as your selection.\n\nWe walked into the door and was greeting by Drew and told him we have a reservation. He told us to wait near the bar so the host can seat us. After we sat, Drew came back and ask us how was our day. Friendly, personal, and a great way to start our anniversary dinner. He also told us that we still apply to the happy hour special since we are early.  \n\nDrinks - Lambrusco sparkling red wine by the glass.\n\nWife wanted some sweet dessert wine (not for paring the seafood), but more for a good night out. With the recommendation, it wasn't bad.  I opt for just your normal water by the glass.\n\nOur first arrival - 1/2 Dozen Miyagi oysters from Tomales Bay, 4 Kumamoto from Washington. \n\nThe Special on this selection was the $1 Miyagi Oyster from Tomales Bay. We thought to give it a try. Along with the happy hour special, my wife loves Kumamoto and we proceed in ordering them on the main menu. The Oyster came on a chilled filled iced, and 6 Oysters on the left and the other half on the right. The middle center were two small dip sauce with a slice of lemon to wake th Oyster up.  \n\nWe must say, the Miyagi Oyster is by far tasty than the Kumamoto. It had a better taste, and more rich of freshness. A good way to start the seafood catch. \n\u00a0\nSecond arrival - Peel & Eat Gulf Prawns.  \n\nWe ordered four and our vision of Gulf Prawns where the black giant tiger prawns.  Boy were we wrong! As it arrived, we didn't think much of it until we took a double take. Is this Gulf Prawn? It wasn't bad in size but it wasn't giant size also. Your typical Prawn steam an chilled, then served on ice with dipping sauce with lemon at the center.\n\u00a0\nThird arrival - Crudo for Two: \nArctic char - horseradish creme fraiche, Wasabi tobiko, dill.  Scallop - corn puree, radish, chive.  Butterfish - pickled fennel, espellete pepper, Basile.  Tombo tuna - citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko\n\nWow. What a fresh taste! The the butterfish with a little hint of spice from the espellete pepper made your tongue sensor go wild and then calm with the mixture of Basile and fennel into the mix. The citrus and chili in the Tambo tuna lighten the mouth with fruit texture and a clean popping wash of the yuzu tobiko on each bite. The Arctic char had the smokey taste but a small clear of the noise of the Wasabi tobiko. And finally, the scallop is so fresh that it melt in your mouth on each bite. No need to chew like a gum, it just melt!   \n\u00a0\nForth arrival - Lobster and Tomato Salad: Burrata, little gems, corn, banyuls vinaigrette.\n\nThis dish is refreshing and light. It had all the right mixture but wished it had a little more lobster. But overall, a nice light dish to pack into the balance meal with greens/veggies.\n\u00a0\nFifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\nWe shared a large Chowder bowl and it was under the happy hour pricing. Can't beat that! The wifey said she could have passed on this dish, but I enjoyed it. It is different from other Chowder bowls we've tried, but it is just a little salty. If you didn't get bread on the side, it is a must to balance off the saltiness that comes from the Bacon, Cream, and Butter? \n\nSixth arrival - Roasted Crab: scallions, aleppo pepper, chili, verjus, tarrgon.\n\nWe wanted to give the crab a try as some reviewer mention it is a taste to try. Since we are here for seafood, why not! The Aleppo pepper and chili sure pack some heat to this dish. I like it but it is really messy. We were advise to be dirty when chowing down on this dish and we continued to say, bring it on. The crab isnt big and with each bite brought a good heat to the mouth and the tomato base tried to smooth out the heat. Overall, we will pass on this dish.\n\u00a0\nSeventh arrival - Crude for Two.\nWhat can we say, we wanted round #2 and nothing will explain more than Yum!\n\u00a0\nFinal arrival - Truffles on the house. \nWhat a surprise and Drew gave us House made Truffles for our Happy Anniversary dinner. All I have to say, it was tasty and sweet! The last taste of the night and it was good.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nA local small seafood hangout and must try during happy hours. We left with a fulfilled night out and all the dishes ordered were good to great. The noise level can be a little high as the place is small with high ceilings which echoes back conversation your next table patron having on heated discussion (or argument).

I may be stating the obvious, but if you're a vegetarian, you're going to have a really tough time eating here.\n\nAmbiance-wise, it's nice, with a lot of natural sunlight in the front and high ceilings. It can get loud, so you may not be able to hear other people in your group super well.\n\nCrudo Sampler (4 pieces, $14, 8 pieces, $28)- I got the sampler for 2, which came with 8 pieces, and shared with the person I was dining with. Or if you have a favorite, you can get 4 pieces of just that one fish for $14, but I really liked the variety. The cuts of fish were thick, the fish was fresh, and each piece had a little bit of garnish to make it a little extra special and unique (a hint of wasabi, a piece of kumquat). The garnish or sauces didn't overpower the taste of the fish, which I appreciated.\n\nUni Avocado Toast ($14) - It was interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but it's expensive (yes, I know it's uni), for what you get. The size of the \"toast\" was like those mini toasts you get in a box from Trader Joe's, and about 2 inches long. It was topped with avocado and uni and dressed with too much lime, which was just overpowering. I'll stick to uni at Japanese restaurants, and stick to avocado on a thick slab of toast at places like Jane or Reveille Coffee. Came with a small salad (or maybe it was decoration) that was overly limey, but I ate it anyways because I was wondering where the rest of the dish was, and I was hungry.\n\nBranzino ($28) - The fish was nice and well-cooked and seasoned, but you'll be picking around little bones all night. Just be warned. Compared to getting 8 pieces of sashimi for $28 and getting an entire filet of fish, this is probably a better deal and will keep you relatively full.\n\nAll in all, it was a pricey meal - for 2 people, with the crudo sampler, 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine and branzino, it was $114 before tip & tax.

We were allowed to stand on the side behind the bar and order some drinks. There is a fairly large selection of beer that ranges from so-so beers to good beers. I wanted to be adventurous and try two beers I've never tried before. Unfortunately I picked two that were not really to my liking. Oh well.\n\nWe sat down for dinner and contemplated what to order. We were told that the kitchen closes in 30 minutes, so we'd have to order soon. Our waiter was very nice, amicable, and very attentive. Props for this! It was busy and he made sure we were taken care of.\n\nFood:\n++Sashimi (Artic Char, Salmon, Tuna) - We asked for some honest opinions on which ones to order. Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so. Our cuts were fairly fresh, but it definitely wasn't the freshest sashimi I've had. The portions were large and usually come with 4 pieces per order, but they were able to do 5 and prorate the 5th piece proportionally. \n\n++Uni Avocado Toast - These were okay, but definitely not great. It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish. On it's own, the uni was pretty good and paired well with the avocado, but leaves you scratching your head asking what completes this dish? Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own! Other than that, the lighting is dimmed, and its very cozy and intimate. Good for small parties and perhaps dates.\n\nOverall, the service was good, and the food was decent, but I was really hoping for this place to blow my mind. The price is just a bit on the more expensive side for what you get, but overall isn't bad. Everything in this review directs it to a A-Ok rating. Sums it up perfectly.\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend this place, but I'm sure that won't stop you from going.

Reservations at 6 meant just in time to squeeze in happy hour (which ends at 6:30), and the soup-loving parentals dug the $5 seafood chowder cups.\n\nThe chowder came chocked with seafood goodness, while the bacon-infused broth reminded me more of a thick, hearty bisque than a brothy, satisfying soup. Other happy hour priced bar bites included the shishito peppers (meh), the spicy-tinged marinated mussels (liked the spice), and $1 oysters.\n\nThe dinner menu proved more promising, if more expensive. The menu is sparse, split into three entree-ish sections: raw, cold, hot. Like many a modern restaurant, dishes aren't meant to be eaten in traditional appetizer to entree form. Mixing in a big group is preferable.\n\nThe raw dishes are perhaps Bar Crudo's finest offerings, a take on sashimi that clearly screams Asian fusion. We tried five of six, leaving off the most traditional Ahi Tuna cube. The creme fraiche Char is reportedly the house favorite. I most dug the Ono and its sweet-spicy-sour grapefruit-jalapeno complement, while the table fawned over the Fluke and Quail Egg, heavily laced with truffle oil. Word of caution: these bad boys are neither cheap nor filling.\n\nCold dishes were forgettable. I wouldn't order either the San Sebastian (tuna confit with various side dishes) or the lobster beet salad again, though the lobster chunks were thick and hearty.\n\nThe sauce for the head-on Louisiana Prawns was spicily delicious, though being from so close to the Gulf, I'd call it more \"Franks Red Hot\" than \"Lousiana Hot Sauce\" spicy. The whole roasted Branzino was a crowd-pleaser for this Asian table, and a very good dish to share for a large party.\n\nI was set to award Bar Crudo five stars until a visit to the nothing short of incredible Swan Oyster Depot the next day. The freshness of Swan put Bar Crudo to shame, and it was easy to see some of Bar Crudo's more egregious errors. Most notably, the stuck-on shrimp shells was disappointing, and the oysters tasted short of sea-worthy fresh.\n\nAmbiance and waitstaff were solid, and our second story booth was cozy and comfortable.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-05-31"}, {"excerpts": ["The $1 oysters are on point.

While she is pouring, he tells me about the area of Cinque Terre's small coastal villages in region of Liguria in the province of La Spezia. I'm enchanted by my glass of wine and loving hearing about where it's from. \n\nNext up, the Lobster Beet salad, with gold and chiogga beets, burrata, mache, pistachios, banyuls vinaigrette.

Arrived their early ( ~6:45pm) and was able to be seated right away. In my experience, a reservation isn't needed cause this place isn't overrun, but it wouldn't hurt. Plus, it's super easy to get one using OpenTable. AND, if you do end up on a waitlist of some sort, there's plenty of bars and cafe's nearby in NOPA (The Mill, Candybar, Flybar etc.)\n\nOur server was incredibly kind and patient with us as we selected what wine by the glass we wanted. You can try the various wines they serve by the glass before deciding. We ended up selecting a Gruner that was light, crisp and mineraly to go with the seafood.\n\nThe atmosphere for dinner on that day was very East Coast yacht club-y. Low lighting plus an open bar where you can watch the cooks shuck shellfish sitting on ice. Lots of wine glasses and sweaters and women wearing jewelry. If you've been to Hog Island, it has a similar vibe with less tourists (and not as good oysters).  \n\nWe ordered the Crudo Sampler for two, the San Sebastian, and the Seafood Chowder. So what's a crudo? 'Crudo' essentially means 'raw'. The crudo sampler is an assortment of their various raw fish dishes, which the pictures on Yelp can better show than I can explain. You get 4 pieces/person and they taste amazing. Complex and immensely satisfying. If you like sashimi, you will enjoy it.\n\nThe San Sebastian came to us highly recommended by our server who described it as a deconstructed nicoise salad -- she's right, it's essentially a deconstructed nicoise salad. We were surprised by how good this was, if you're not as into raw fish definitely try this one out as the tuna is cooked.\n\nThe Seafood Chowder is a tomato and cream-based chowder to which they add bacon bits. I am a fan of comforting rich foods, and this hits the spot. The price structure is $8 cup / $16 bowl, and protip: if you're going to share between 2 people, I'd recommend getting 2 cups because you'll get more soup for the same price\n\nOverall, this place is great. Good food, good atmosphere; it's not too loud or busy which a lot of nice places in SF can be and the price isn't ridiculous for the quality of food you're getting. You're getting the nice restaurant on Valencia St vibe but more enjoyable and without the crowds. Enjoy!\n\nAlso: They have a really great Happy Hour deal from 5-6:30.

Made reservations on Opentable.com and changed it a couple of times (including day of). Parking was so easy on a Sunday late afternoon (around 5:15pm) so we arrived 20 minutes early. The hostess accommodated us and kindly guided us to our table - poured us cucumber infused water (yum!) and handed us the menu (HH and regular). \n\nSince we already knew what we wanted, we went ahead and ordered a few minutes later. The food came our relatively quickly (since most of it is raw) and the service was amazing! One lady kept coming over to our table to ask if everything was going alright and kept giving us bread for our sauces and soup. She was very nice and made the experience more delightful.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Miyagi Oysters $1 each\nMy bf loved his oysters (I didn't have any since I'm not a fan). He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it! Though don't get overboard cause it could get a bit salty. My bf commented that if a hot link were to be liquified, it would taste like this (the sauce). \n\n4. Crudo Sampler $13 (not on HH menu)\nCame with 4 different items: artic char, scallop, ono, and butterfish. My favorites were the artic char and the scallop. Though I didn't think it was spectacular (I think I had too high of an expectation from all the great reviews). Don't get me wrong, the fish were really fresh and the complex flavors were executed well, but I don't think I would crave for it... The ono and butterfish were too fatty and soft in texture for me. \n\n5. Seafood Chowder $5 \nNot your ordinary chowder. Not super thick, creamy, nor filling like clam chowder. It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal. Though the chowder looks small, it's packed with seafood (fish and shrimp) and potatoes! I asked for even more bread to accompany the chowder, which made it less tart-y and more delicious! :)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was great. Prices are good for seafood, but portions are pretty small. We managed to spend almost $50 for our pre-dinner happy hour snack.... The food was fresh and full of flavor, but I didn't think it was mind-blowning that I would come back anytime soon. I just wanted to try this place based on the great reviews.

I knew going in the portions would be minuscule but what I didn't expect was for the quality to be sub par.

The artic char was the best of the quad. Similar to sake (salmon) sashimi, it was silky smooth and the butteriness was heightened from the cream fraiche.

When we told our waiter we wanted to cancel our order but he said it was being plated (we didn't receive the bone marrow until 10 minutes after). We told him we've been waiting for a while and he said in a curt tone, \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'll just take one order off the bill.\" A simple, \"I'm sorry...\" would have sufficed but his condescending remark left us blatantly offended.

The only negative is the parking, so definitely allow an extra 15 minutes for that (more on this below)\n\nI would come back to this place in a heart beat.\n\nRelatively simple idea: freshest sea food in classic and creative ways. Raw oysters (6 types), raw lobster, crab, shrimp.  Cooked fish favorites like mussels, seabass.  This place is a fish lover's delight. \n\nBest of all - huge portions.  We ordered a raw ahi tuna with 3 pieces for $14.  We expected sushi-size slices but each of the 3 pieces had enough tuna for a sushi roll.  They were significantly sized cubes of succulent fresh tuna  (like 4cm^3...nerdy enough for you, SF?)\n\nAlso loved their interpretation of clam chowder. It was more like a bisque (and huge fan of lobster bisque) but with lots of clams, mussels, salmon in it.  The BF ordered the whole sea bass (FYI its not the large chilean one...but the branzino - the european seabass that sells at whole foods for $12.99).  The preparation was good but I don't find the branzino to be nearly as juicy and succulent as the chilean seabass, so that was a little bit of a disappointment.  But rest of the dish was well done.\n\nMy only real complaint was on the uni avocado app. My love for uni is only paralleled by the love for my dog. Uni on some smeared avocado, on a large piece of toasted baguette is...just not good. Sure it's got a creamy texture, but uni really can't be used as a spread. Maybe mix it with some capellini and dungeness crab? I would die over a dish like that...\n\nAlso, maybe add a squid ink pasta dish to the menu, bar crudo? =]\n\noh yeah - about the parking.  Parking requires some advance planning. If there's a show at the independent, then you better rely on the parking lot 3 blocks away (fell and broderick).  The lot across the street from bar crudo is a sketchy lot of a pot clinic/trailer or something. Not the best spot to take your chances.  The issue with the parking lot 3 blocks away is that it's a pretty big parking lot (100-150 cars?) and there's only ONE machine to pay.  So there was a line of 4 people in front of us on a saturday night (which doesn't seem too bad except the machine has about 12 steps) and the two 60+ year old guys in the front couldn't figure out how to use the machine and managed to get their credit card stuck in there for a solid 5 minutes.  Then there's the woman with the crying baby who can't get the coupon code for bi-rite market to work in the machine.  The list of issues go on and on.  So yeah...definitely allocate 15minutes extra for parking.

We were seated in a nice big table upstairs (the only big table in the restaurant) with a welcome view of the kitchen below.\n\nThe happy hour was amazing! Beers and glasses of wine were only $2-3 each and raw oysters (from Washington) were $1 each! We ordered 80 raw oysters for the table and there were plenty for the entire group to enjoy! I loved how the oysters came out 40 at a time on a beautiful large shallow platter of ice lined with raw seaweed for decoration (see picture). The oysters also came with cocktail sauce and a sweet 'n' sour vinegar shallot mignonette which we asked for more of as well as some tapatio to spice things up. We also ordered some clams and they were good but not memorable. For all that we ordered, we were fully satisfied and the bill came down to less than $10 a person! I highly recommend making reservations and coming for happy hour!

We learned that the best way to eat it was to scrape everything off the fish, and then just add a little bit of sauce back on. My personal favorite was the atlantic char. The butterfish was delicious too though. I would definitely go back here during happy hour for the oysters! \n\nPros: \n- very reasonably priced happy hour menu \n- seafood was very fresh \n- not too busy for dinner (no need for reservation)\n\nCons: \n- spices and toppings tended to be too strong/too much", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-10-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Happy Hour Oysters every day?!

Now they've expanded to a slightly larger space in NOPA that's nearly identical except it's commemorative stamp sized.\n\nIt was disorganized in a charming, quirky way. By 5:30PM on a Friday the place was packed with a 45 minute wait for happy hour. I explained to the stern hostess, ready for a confrontation, that I'd been trying to call them for two days to say we'd be a little late. She shrugged kindly, admitted they aren't the best about answering phones, and promptly marched to one of the best seats in the house.\n\nOrdering anything but the crudo for two at Bar Curdo is like going to Tony's PIzza and having the meatballs, or the Crab Shack and having the chicken. But that's just what we did, to mixed results. The happy hour oysters weren't the best. No real problems, just not great oysters. Jalapeno mussels were pretty good but even at $1 each pretty expensive. Shisito peppers were so good we ordered a second.

They're not pretentious here, your waiter will fill your water or clear your plate, the hostess or food runner can take a wine order.\n\nThe complete standout is the crudo, which is not a happy hour dish but is basically why you should come here.

We were in absolutely no way disappointed.  We were only in San Francisco for two nights and wanted to get the best seafood we could get our hands on.  \n\nWe were greeted warmly at the door at 6:30 (our reservation was for 6:45, but our bus was early).  The place was pretty packed and we were directed to a little waiting area next to the bar and offered menus while we waited for our table.\n\nAfter we were seated, another gentleman, not our server, greeted us and asked if we had any questions about the menu.  We ordered several items (everything looked so good) and he helped us pick some beers from their incredibly well-rounded list.  \n\nHe explained to us how he would course the items we ordered, beginning with the Crudo, then the salad, then the crab, and finishing with the seafood chowder, because it was very heavy and rich.  He left us the beer and wine list, in case we wanted to try something else for our second round.  My date asked if we could keep a food menu as well, in case we needed to order more food.  The gentleman smiled and said, \"Oh, no you won't,\" in a sing-songy voice as he walked away.  I suppose if we had been other people, we may have been offended, but I thought it was funny.\n\nThe Butterfish and Ahi Tuna were our favorite of the five Crudo dishes, but the others were just as fresh and flavorful.  Each fish was paired with a sauce and some kind of ingredient, specific to complementing the characteristics of the fish.  The portions are a really good size, for the price.  We had planned to get a Crudo for 2 (8 pieces, 2 of each of four fish) and an order of Ahi (4 pieces).  The gentleman who took our order suggested that we get two pieces of each fish, so that we could try each of them, so he did an Open food charge for $6 for the 2 pieces of Tuna & they were all plated together nicely.  \n\nNext came the Octopus salad, with grilled octopus.  It was lightly charred, slightly smokey, served hot, and melted in your mouth!  Delicious!\n\nAs our server, a friendly dark haired lady, cleared the salad, my date ordered one of each of the five oysters.  She was able to add these to our order in time to get them on the same serving dish as the Dungeness crab we'd ordered.  Prior to the delivery of the shellfish, she brought our sauces: drawn butter, cocktail sauce, and mignonette.  He really enjoyed the oysters (the Kumamoto and Kusshi best of the five - I don't do oysters).  The crab was firm, fresh, yum.  I've never had chilled Dungeness crab before.  It did not disappoint at all.  \n\nAs we finished the crab, we looked at each other and knew that we didn't need the two cups of Seafood Chowder we'd ordered, although it looked amazing on the table next to us.  When our server checked on us, we asked (for the first time ever in our lives) if we could cancel the chowders, or if she'd already ordered them.  She said that she hadn't yet fired them - she was waiting to finish clearing our crab.  She was very gracious about cancelling them.  I'm just hoping that she really hadn't fired them yet!  \n\nWe made up for it by ordering another round of drinks and a cheese plate for dessert.  The dressings served with the cheese (a fresh quartered fig, marmalade, and honey) were good, but we weren't crazy about the cheeses themselves.  The bleu didn't have much taste and the camembert was more bitter than I like (I'm not sure that I've ever actually had camembert before).  As this was the only item we weren't crazy about, I'm still going to give this place 5 stars.\n\nService was excellent and efficient and the food was delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced.

So, I made reservations to come on his birthday. When we got there, they didn't have our reservation. However, the host was very accomodating and managed to seat us anyway. We got there about 6pm so Happy Hour was still in effect until 6:30pm. We ordered a dozen of raw oysters ($1 each), seafood chowder ($6) and manila clams ($6). The oysters were good but not great but we were happy that it was only $1 each. The seafood chowder had a lot of seafood in one little bowl but I thought it was just mediocre b/c they used too much heavy cream and was a bit too sour. The manila clams were delicious and probably the best item on the menu. The broth was very tasty and there was a good amount of clams.  When we were done with our HH meals, we ordered from the dinner menu - had the crudo sampler for two ($28), half a dozen of raw little neck clams ($2.50 each) and the lobster salad ($18)...all disappointments!!! The presentation of the food was beautiful but deceiving!!! It definitely looked better than it tasted. The crudo sampler had the arctic char (salmon), scallop, butterfish and ono. The seafood were NOT fresh at all!!! Fresh seafood does not taste fishy! Their \"raw\" seafood was served room temperature (not cold and refreshing) and tasted very fishy, like old fish that's been sitting around too long.  The raw little neck clams were a disappointment. We are such huge fans of them at Mission Rock Resort but these were not fresh, had dirt in them and again, not cold...served room temperature...yuk! The lobster salad was a joke for $18...few pieces of lobster that tasted so bland and was not even fresh and sweet. How can you mess up so bad on lobster? It was mixed with some bland beets, gooey cheese that looked like fresh mozarella and was topped with some greens and pistachio nuts. The pistachio nuts were the best in the salad. I'm a huge salad fan and this was a total failure! \n\nThis restaurant is very confused with their food. I noticed that everyone who gave great ratings only came for the happy hour and was happy with their HH food. If I came for their HH food, I think I would've given them a better rating too. But the people who ate their dinner were disappointed like me. I wouldn't mind paying top dollar for good tasting high quality food. At Bar Crudo, the seafood is not fresh, the food is not tasty and the price is too high for such low quality small portions. I do have to say they have great customer service. We were well attended and our host and server were both were friendly and attentive. Their complimentary bread and cucumber water was good. \n\nI forgot to mention the noise level at this place in CRAZY noisy. It's not even a big place but everyone was talking so loud. I had to shout to place my order and it was hard to have a decent conversation with my date. Not a great place for a first date or with kids. What a disappointment!!!

"], "author": "Janice A.", "review": "The problem with living in San Francisco for a long time is that inevitably, you will be disappointed. You equate one restaurant with one pure, superb dish and continue to return for years. Eventually, you go to recreate the epiphany of that first taste and find that the dish is the same, but the place is not. That dish is the seafood chowder and that place is Bar Crudo.\n\nMy husband and I sat at the bar one weeknight around 9pm. He ordered some oysters, a bowl of chowder, and a beer, and I, truth be told, having had half a carne asada burrito around 5pm, wasn't that hungry. So I ordered a glass of wine, a small plate of crudo, and 2 (yup) Gulf prawns. The waitress was somewhat dubious of my order, asking, \"have you been here before?\" I answered yes, but should have added that we are in fact some of your original customers from the Bush Street glory days. The kind that used to be on your email list for your beer tasting dinner menu, i.e. LOYAL.\n\nShe put the order in, then the chef at the raw bar -- where we were sitting -- got the ticket and started to make a stink, something to the effect of \"who eff orders 2 prawns??\" Um, I do -- the customer sitting RIGHT in front of you. If I wanted judgment with my dinner, I would save myself some money, go back home and eat with my parents.\n\nI would call the incident a fluke except for the fact that during our previous visit, we had gone to dinner to celebrate and ordered some crudo, the chowder, and a small seafood platter. I had intended to order the cheese plate for dessert, but the waitress had already closed the ticket. I'm either not eating enough, or eating too much depending on their mood.\n\nThe chowder was delicious as usual, but the front of the house attitude and poor service really spoiled what used to be a special spot for us. Seriously, if you want to criticize your customer's ordering habits, talk about it on your break, or don't offer an \u00e0 la carte menu.\n\nI didn't want to write this review, but my hope is that the owners (and other SF restaurateurs) will realize there is a contingent of diners in the city who are getting consistently disappointed by the attitude and lack of service in San Francisco.

The service was PHENOMENAL, specifically our beautiful server. She was knowledgeable when I asked about wine selections when I gave her my preferences (I know nothing about wine) and patient with us as well.\n\nThe food was delicious. The bf and I happened to stop during their happy hour period. We decided on some oysters (they have a bunch of varieties) and their manila clams. I've never really had raw oyster before, so this was definitely an eye-opening experience. The clams were good, albeit a very small portion for $5. However, the sauce the clams came in was SO GOOD. We ordered more bread just so we could dip it into the sauce.\n\nFor our entrees I had the Trout.

It just seemed like the meat had been sitting in water a little too long, so it had this weird texture around the meat that I scrapped off.\n\nWhile I understand you tend to pay premium for seafood, being me I don't know if I can warrant spending that extra money on dishes that doesn't necessarily fill you up and leave you feeling hungry after dinner. (This doesn't apply to just Bar Crudo, but seafood in general)\n\nOverall would I go back? It's really iffy. Spent over $94 (without tip) for 2 people and we weren't really full.

Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

If you like your salmon with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tobiko, then you would LOVE this.\n\nHOKKAIDO SCALLOPS: it was my second favorite, while this was the other two's favorites.  We loved the texture of the scallop when you bite into it and the flavors of the pea puree along with the citrus flavor of the lime went perfect with the scallop. \n\nKONA KAMPACHI: one of my friends and I rated this as third best, while this was the least favorite for the other friend. It wasn't too bad, the fish was really fresh and I probably could have done without the citrusy flavor of the peaches and the chili lime vinaigrette.  The sprouts on top, didn't seem to help with the flavor either, could have done without that garnish.\n\nBUTTERFISH: my favorite, one of my friends' third favorite and the other's least favorite.  I just loved the combination of the butterfish with the serrano ham and the salmorejo sauce.  It was the PERFECT combination along with a quail egg. This just did it for me.  I loved the flavor and it left me wanting MORE!!\n\nNext we had the STEAK CRUDO, which was beautifully presented.

But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  It went well with their bread.  It was very nicely flavored and spiced.\n\nLOBSTER HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD: absolutely to die for!!! IT WAS THE BEST DISH WE GOT!! We all LOVED it. If you come here, you MUST order this.  Their heirloom tomatos were fresh, sweet and juicy.  The fresh mozzerella melted in my mouth.  The lobster, plump, juicy, fresh, sweet and DELICIOUS.  The vinaigrette dressing went well with everything and the greens were nice fresh and crisp.  EVERYTHING just went well together!\n\nAfter everything came out...we wanted MORE...so we ordered...\n\nMONKFISH LIVER MOUSSE: sounds disgusting, but it wasn't too bad.  It had a very unique taste to it and after awhile it became pretty addicting.  Went very well with the bread. \n\nTUNA CONFIT: Another winner in my books.  I loved the tenderness of the tuna and the mix of asparagus and fresh bell peppers it was made with.  Olives complimented well with the rest of the dish and the TOMATO bread was DELICIOUS!!! Also loved the egg, which was cooked to perfection (not too cooked, not too raw...it had a perfect yellow yolk). I could have done without the cheese though.\n\nOCTOPUS SALAD: Just didn't deliver for me.  I didn't like the taste of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I was expecting a more citrus flavor to it.\n\nThey served all the raw seafood first, then they served the cooked food.\n\nLastly we had the MANILA CLAMS: it wasn't all that great.

Star chefs will do a menu featuring a particular ingredient or preparation; examples that come to mind: skatewing, foie gras corndogs, sunchokes, kanapachi, wagyu, foam, raw, you get the idea.  Soon everyone is doing it until it is overexposed like certain young Hollywood stars.  Bar Crudo is a trendsetter; watch for many to follow in their very capable footsteps.

Bar Crudo is awesome, and I come every now and then because it's always a great fix for seafood. Their arctic char is great and the chowder is too die for. We also had oysters and the uni toast today. \n\nHowever, Jennifer W. decided to make my visit a little crappier today.\n\nI'm one who tips your standard 15-20%. Today, I made a bit of an accident because I was trying to account for the fact that I bought a beer when no one else in my party had. Our tab came out to $152 after taxes and the SF surcharge (so a 15% tip would have been $20), and after subtracting for my delicious Rasputin Stout, it came out to $36 for everyone else before taxes and tip. Everyone else decided to put in $4 (a little on the low side), and I was planning to put in a little extra on my own for both my beer and for tip. However, I was admittedly a little tipsy and when it came to signing off my credit card, I completely forgot to put extra in my tip for my beer and to cover the rest. All in all, we came out to a $16 tip ($4 x 4) after I had initially signed my receipt. \n\nI thought we were squared away and we were about to leave, but Jennifer rushes  in and asks us if anything was wrong. Not realizing my faux-pas on the calculation, I responded \"No! Everything was great!\". Then, Jennifer proceeds to say, \"Well was anything wrong? You only left $16 on a $152 tab (by the way this was after sales tax and the SF health surcharge; so our tip as it was was only 12% vs the 15% we were planning to leave)\". I wasn't getting it, so she kept iterating that our tip was low. I finally made the connection that I had forgotten to include the beer, and I promptly corrected it. However, I felt as if I was browbeat into it by this waitress, and I was not very appreciative of that. I gladly will pay the right tip, but don't be rude about it. In the service industry (I work in consulting, which some may not think is analogous to the job of a waitress/waiter, but I think client service is client service) you should never act as if you deserved to get paid extra. And, Jennifer needs to learn that lesson as she pretty much ruined a pretty amazing meal as I was very steamed after that.\n\n+5 for the food, -4 for the crappy aftertaste Jennifer imparted during the last 2 minutes in the restaurant.

We arrived a bit early for our reservation but were seated within 5 minutes.\nThe wine list is great - eclectic and broad, shooting for good, solid examples of local and international wines to match with the cuisine.  The beer list is amazing - laid out in order of intensity with lots of selections from the best of the best.

Tender, hyper-fresh fish wearing nothing but a few simple accompaniments to bring out the charm.  We loved the Butterfish so much we then ordered another plate with 4 portions of it.\nThe lobster salad was ok. The waiter told us that it was amazing with the heirloom beets from previous weeks, however the chef was using heirloom tomatoes this time. Texturally it wasn't exciting.  Although a bit full, we decided to have the chowder to finish, in lieu of dessert.  OMG.

This was worth breaking the bowl and licking the shards.\nService was good - casual, relaxed SF hipster style.

The waitress could tell we were loving it. Third round, the steak tartar with different toppings and crostini. Wow! The creme fraiche topping was the best!

The food was completely on point.  \n\nWe started with a couple of oyster samplers, which was really fun.  Usually when I get a plate of oysters, I can't tell much of a difference, but this was totally different.  Most of our table enjoyed the Kusshi's the most because they were so silky smooth.  \n\nThen, we ordered a bunch of the raw dishes.  We got the Kona Kampachi, which was my personal favorite.  I loved the pairing with peaches, and the avocado mousse went nicely with everything to tie it together.  We also got the butterfish, scallops, and the fluke.  All of the flavors were totally different, which made everything seem like a great tasting menu. \n\nWe got the lobster tomato salad with burrata, which was so delicious.  To be fair though, I love anything with burrata.  We also got the whole dungeness crab.  Here's where I think the service could have been a little bit better.  First of all, we got crab crackers to help us get the meat out, but it would have been really great if we also got a crab pick/scoop.  Using our regular fork was a little too unwieldy.  Plus, the busboy took away the butter before the whole table was done eating, so we requested more, but it took a little bit of time.  Also, at the end of the crab, it would have been really nice to get some wipes or a finger bowl to clean our hands.  I mean, c'mon, we just ate a whole crab with our hands.  We did end up getting bread, but only after we asked for it after seeing it on other tables.  \n\nFinally, we got to the hot portion of the meal:  devil prawns, scallops in coconut curry sauce, and the seafood chowder.  Due to the bacon flavor and overall depth of the chowder sauce, I believe I told the table if I spilled some of the broth on my arm, I would most likely go Donner party on myself. \n\nOverall, since we were eating some great quality seafood, and our table went a little crazy with the booze, I knew the bill would be on the more expensive side.  I have to say I felt like this restaurant totally deserved it though, because the food we had really was quite commendable.  I am not the type of person who eats a ton of fish outside of sushi, and the variety and interesting mix of flavors on this menu were able to keep me totally engaged throughout.  \n\nMy one last comment on this place though was they didn't have anything to offer for dessert, which was disappointing.

Sure, I have tried oysters (not really my thing- but how can you blame me, being from the Midwest?), and those are presented not really in a Latin or Japanese fashion- but for the most part- raw fish was always something that I would have only at those two types of places.\n\nNow- I simply have to think back to that cold August evening when I went with my fiance (now wife) to try this place out to remember how limited my food experiences have been.  It was eyeopening, and almost maddening for me to realize that such wonderfully creative presentations can be done- but only with the finest and freshest fish and shell fish around.  It was a wonderful, and yet frustrating experience- realizing that living in Chicago limits me to this type of food that I really love and now consider to be one of the best ways of presenting raw seafood.\n\nCrudo being the Italian word for raw, we somewhat expected things to be presented with that type of background.  I guess one could interpret it that way a bit- but only in the sense that truly great Italian cooks will only use things that are fresh, accessibly local, and in season- and Bar Crudo does this.  The chefs allowing the ingredients to sing for themselves, without manipulating the flavors through various cooking methods is a terrific way of experiencing the freshness and liveliness of such high quality ingredients.\n\nTo top off the crudo experience (in which we shared quite a few oysters as well ad the Crudo Sampler), we had ordered one of their hot dishes- in which we got grilled jaw/cheek of something (tuna maybe) and this too was wonderfully flavored, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience.  Be forewarned now though, with the space of the restaurant being quite small, feeling cramped even, you will want to be sure to get reservations when you plan on going.

I'm glad I did because this is a place where one could have the \"menu problem\" or not know what or how much to order. I used to work at a tapas place in Thailand, and we always had people confused with the concept. Our plates were tiny and usually about 5-7 bites. People would not understand, so they'd order one dish thinking that each was an entree. A typical conversation with a customer at Papa's Tapas would go something like this:\n\nCustomer: \"I'd like the chicken wrapped in banana leaves.\"\nMe: \"Well, sir, all of our dishes are small plates. Depending upon your level of hunger, a party of 2 such as yourselves should order between 6-8 dishes.\"\nCustomer: \"Well, we're not all that hungry, so we'll also have the asparagus.\"\nMe: \"Yes, sir, like I said, two dishes will get you and your wife started but it will by no means fill you up.\"\nCustomer: \"We plan to have dessert as well.\"\nMe: *walks away shaking head*\n\nAnyway, back to Bar Crudo.

I've been trying to get to Bar Crudo forever, but am seldom in the neighborhood. We were able to score a table for three after shuffling back and forth in front of the door for about 15 minutes. I was a little buzzed and checking out everybody's food, so I didn't mind too much.

That being said, we also weren't in the mood to drop $200 on dinner that night. We agreed to try some of the crudos, the lobster and burrata salad (b/c I can rarely resist creamy fresh burrata), and a then finish with a seafood chowder, both for something warm and to fill any lingering appetites. \n\nWe tried the ono, tombo tuna, and yellowtail crudos. The entire table was alarmed by the overpowering pineapple vanilla vinaigrette that topped the tombo tuna.  Pristine fresh fish should not be drowned out by such strong flavors. When the manfriend tasted it first and remarked, \"This tastes like Lifesavers,\" I thought he was more buzzed than I had realized. Upon trying the tombo tuna myself, I could not believe the uncanny resemblance to pineapple lifesavers!\n\nThe crudos were all stunning to look at; each plated with tiny microgreens, light sprinklings of exotic ingredients, and bright splashes of sauces for color. Except for the pineapple misstep, the others were very much enjoyed. The lobster salad was also a posh treat. The grad student salary does not allow for frequent lobster consumption these days. It was even more enjoyable to have plump juicy chunks of lobster primed for my consumption without having to decorticate it myself. \n\nThe seafood chowder was everything I hoped for and very richly garnered all the prior praise from others' reviews.

We asked for more of the table bread and an extra ramekin of honey, so it wasn't a 'disaster', but I was disappointed by the initial lack of honey.

When I saw how small the bar area/waiting space was and how quickly more people came in with their reservations, I start to worry about how the staff will accommodate all of us sorta crammed at the door in an orderly fashion.

The metal tables reminded me of Cafe Maritime (seems like the chef used to work there according to reviews I read here).   Our waitress was sweet and warm as well.  \n\nThe maitre d' who had us wait downstairs was interesting to observe.  He'd come up every two minutes to adjust the position of the chair next to us ever so slightly.  I suppose a perfectionist?  Maybe a nervous compulsive thing?  Unfortunately when that table was filled, he couldn't adjust the chair anymore.  So instead, he'd come upstairs, walk around it, and then go downstairs.  \n\nAlright, the food: oysters were delicious!  I don't know if anyone ever remembers the names of oysters they eat, especially when they come in a variety.  I sure don't. The crudo sampler reminded me of the sashimi three-way at Michael Mina.  Very pretty presentation, but slightly strong for my taste.  I couldn't really taste the fish themselves.  I didn't really touch my boyfriend's steak crudo, but it looked good and he claimed it to be good.  The seafood chowder we shared was good too.  He said it was the best calamari in chowder ever!  Very tender. \n\nI almost ordered another crudo dish just because it seemed like we didn't' order enough to eat.  But by the time I finished the chowder, I was completely full for some reason.

They have an outstanding selection of raw fish that would give the best sushi sashimi bar a run for it's money. I personally enjoyed the Char, as it is difficult to find anyplace that even serves Char. Also, the oysters are fantastic in that they are fresh - and that you have a choice of like 6 different varieties.\n\nAside from the raw bar, they have great cooked dishes such as a mussels and clam dish in a light red sauce - and the absolute BEST seafood chowder. Do yourself a favor and order the chowder. Most chowder I've ever had, I am wondering where the fish is. It is chopped up and hiding as if the chef took the scraps from other dishes to make the stew. Well, not at Bar Crudo. The chowder is filled with big bites of identifiable fish in every bite, and somehow none of it is over-cooked - which is hard to do in a soup-type situation. \n\nIf you are absolutely starving and looking for a hearty meal, this might not be the place for you. Being a restaurant that specializes in raw fish, they really focus on the delicate flavors that raw fish has to offer.

Make a reservation or show up as soon as it opens or you will be waiting a long time for a table or spot at the bar.\n\nThe service is, how shall I say....European? It is slow. You order 3 things and they come one at a time. The waiter disappears for a while. Instead of getting annoyed, enjoy it. Order a bottle of wine (or a beer for their OUTSTANDING Belgian beer selection), order a few dishes, and sit back and enjoy the ride. Be prepared to sit down for a few hours.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["There were four of us, and we started with trying one of each of the oysters they had on the menu that night.

Everything was amazing.  The sauces and little spices complimented the amazingly fresh fish very well.  The tombo tuna melted in our mouths.  The fluke had a little bit of caviar to add a little touch of saltiness which it needed.  We also had the arctic char which had a type of wasabi paste on it which gave it an amazing flavor kick.

I had wanted to go here for what seems like FOREVER, so when we pulled up in front of Bar Crudo to start our evening, I was ecstatic and almost jumped out of the car before he could come to a full stop to drop me off!\n\nWe shared a bottle of Riesling over delectable Kushi oysters and Bluepoints that they had in stock for that evening.  You have to request horseradish separately, which is something I never did understand for any place that serves fresh oysters, but what they bring you is perfectly grated FRESH horseradish.  Crudo menu is fantastic - most notable was the Kanpachi crudo dish.  Four thick slivers of fresh, raw fish, with some nuts and a lovely, slightly tart huckleberry sauce drizzled over it.  It's a remarkable bundle of tastes.  This particular fish has a bit less flavor than typical yellowtail sashimi, but that actually allows the accompaniments to bring it to life, whereas the typical yellowtail sashimi's buttery flavor would kill the accompaniments that grace this dish.  Gazpacho was refreshing - -  a bit of seafood in the middle with a fresh, watermelon-infused cold soup.  Really nice.  We ordered more things - and everything was just truly fresh -  and flavorful.  Bar Crudo really knows how to dress up their raw seafood - - and presents it in a fashion that makes it look so appealing.\n\nService was very good, and even when it became a full house, we never felt neglected.  I should mention the water they gave us - - - somehow, without any change in color, I could taste a bit of watermelon flavor in the water.  I can't say I liked the water itself - - but what it did do at room temperature was serve as palate cleanser everytime you took a swig.  When dealing with a crudo menu - - this served most useful.  Fascinating... I'd have never thought of it.\n\n***********************************************\nSecond time:\n\nAnother night out to dinner w/ Archie the Manly Man.\nThis  time, we order champagne, which I always enjoy with oysters.  The champagne was no Veuve Cliquot, but a Brut 1+1=3.  Really, that was what it was called, and our server recommended it, so we accepted.  Great, it was not, but it got us pretty buzzed so it did what it was supposed to do.\nI was out to challenge Archie's allegedly newfound love of oysters, which he claimed at our last dinner at Ella where I had to twist his arm to get him to try raw oysters.  We'll see.  First, we order Kushi oysters - but they are out, so we end up getting Luna and something else, which name I cannot recall.  Oysters were good but not as good as last time.  I dress my oyster, Archie follows point by point.  I eat - - he eats.  Wow.  He actually does look like he's enjoying oysters.... Reminder to self, take this blossoming oyster-lover-wannabe to Hog Island one day.\n\nGiven this was his first time, I didn't want to risk ordering anything new and ruining his experience here, so I opted to order much of the same as last time, but fewer items as this was only an appetizer for us before the real dinner.  \nEverything was as good as the first time - -  but they had run out of Gazpacho, which was too bad because I really did enjoy that soup last time.  Most notable this night was the scallops w' corn puree..  The Konpachi was good but not as good as  the first time.  The Ono we had was very tasty... but again, it's the freshness that is really impressive.\n\nThere was no watermelon-flavored water, though.\n\n***********************************************\n\nBar Crudo is a place that is more appealing as a \"let's have a drink and get some good appetizer\" place rather than a full dinner location.  Very fresh fish, and I'd dare to guess that the majority of the things on their menu will be good.\nIt is expensive, though.  If you love raw seafood like I do, it can run way beyond $100 pp if you eat here in hopes of filling yourself.  I would just recommend you come here for a plate or three of appetizers, have a couple drinks and be off to a real dinner, like I did on both occasions.\nThe dining area upstairs is very small, and the seafood bar downstairs, while pleasant, is also small.  Make reservations if you want a table, they're available on www.opentable.com and I've had no problems getting one thus far.\n\nBut food aside - what makes Bar Crudo amazing is that in all this time, I have NEVER, EVER seen such an extensive list of Belgian Beers available, from Chimay Blue, Stella, etc.  There must be at least 40 different kinds of Belgian Ales available, a variety of IPAs and double IPAs, etc.  I daresay you'd be hardpressed to find this many Belgian Beers in one place outside of Brussels or something.\n\nFor that alone - BC would get 5 stars, but add in the fresh fish, and you might as well call it \"BAR GRACE\"!!!!\n\n\nThis is the good life, folks.... give it a whirl.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-10-07"}, {"excerpts": ["i would choose your own oysters instead of letting them pick it for you if you are a true oyster connoisseur.  \n\n"], "author": "Anh V.", "review": "it's definitely a place for seafood lovers.\n\nit's small and casual with a really friendly wait staff.  i would choose your own oysters instead of letting them pick it for you if you are a true oyster connoisseur.  \n\nthe appetizer sampler platter had a beautiful presentation.  it was very good but some fish were tastier than others.  the arctic char with horseradish,wasabi and tobiko had a flavorful kick.  the fluke was tasty as well and better than the tuna and the scallops.  \n\nthe special that night was lobster warm or chilled.  it was well prepared but i was still quite hungry after all of those dishes.  \n\ni would come for drinks and some yummy appetizers but head elsewhere for a solid meal.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-12-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The artic char and dollar oysters are the best!

Opened in November 2005, by twin brothers Mike (the chef) and Tim (the house manager) Selvera, Bar Crudo has taken the raw-bar food craze to a new level. Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane. As the evening was rather chilly on my first visit, I tried the marvelously rich seafood chowder with lots of fresh clams, fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, red potatoes, and smoky applewood smoked bacon ($10). Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster. The crudo (raw fish) is the main focus of the menu and includes gloriously spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha, and green onions ($12); Rhode Island black bass with hard quail egg, habanero tobiko and blood orange reduction ($9); and not-to-be-missed arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill ($10). In case you don't like seafood, try the artisan cheese plate with flower honey, seasonal fruit, medjool dates, and nutty walnut bread ($11) and the sherry duck liver mousse with green pepper corns, cornichons and grilled bread. Their rich flavors and tempting texture blend nicely together.  And if you're indecisive about what to have for dessert, don't worry. There's only one item available on the menu, decadent XOX truffles ($6) that were definitely worth the wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to dine alone, or perhaps with your friends or someone special, Bar Crudo's delicious seafood and quaint atmosphere are definitely a winning combination.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["i'm echoing everyone else's faves - the arctic char, lobster beet salad, and oysters are what you come for and they don't disappoint.\n\n"], "author": "royboy m.", "review": "don't know why it took me so long to write a review for one of my favorite restaurants in the city...\n\nthe GF and I discovered this place at its old location last year and loved it.  we've been to the new place 3 times since and loved it every time.  \n\ni'm echoing everyone else's faves - the arctic char, lobster beet salad, and oysters are what you come for and they don't disappoint.\n\nthe wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nonly cons are that the place can get a bit pricey and it can get pretty hot if you sit upstairs on a busy night.  \n\noh, and if you're going to go in a group, i would go with 6 max.  it's not that big a joint.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-02-08"}, {"excerpts": ["delicious mussels, oysters, trout, and do NOT leave without the chocolate truffle dessert.

The bite sized portions were just perfect and I feel that if we had ordered the 4 piece selection of an individual crudo we would have been disappointed.  I was shocked when my favorite crudo happend to be the scallop as I HATE SCALLOPS.  But that little thing was DELICIOUS! Possibly my favorite thing of the night.  The Beausoleil oysters were a great recommendation by our server as well.  Hamachi collar absolutely melted in your mouth and the bf was reluctant to share.  I had the hot clams as my main entree and was a little dissapointed not because they weren't good but because they were a little too spicy for all the delicate food I had just consumed.  There was some spice to some of the crudo selections but it was well balanced where as the spice in the clams was just too overpowering.  Took those home and will probably enjoy them for lunch today.\n\nHad an amazing experience here, enjoyed the quaint and close knit atmosphere, had an excellent dinner and will definitely be back!\n\n(Oh yeah... this place is DEFINITELY not good for large parties but absolutely great for a romantic dinner date)  Thanks Yelp for helping us find a really great restaurant!", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-11-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Started with the mixed crudo platter again, then had the seafood platter, they were out of mussels but added more oysters, yum.

Not served on ice like i've seen at other places.  \n\nWe had the Crudo Sampler and ate in order of spiciness as I had asked the server who brought it. \n\nStarted with the butterfish.  I really enjoyed the black garlic that this came with.  However it was not a melt in your mouth butterfish. Next was the scallop with the celery puree.  This was my favorite.  The scallop was the perfect size and the puree didn't over dominate the scallop.  We then had the tuna.  This was my least favorite.  It was too salty and it was an odd mix of pear/hazelnut with the salt.  Finally finished with the Arctic char and the horsey and wasabi and dill.  I enjoyed the heat in the nose but the char was big and it was chewey.\n\nI asked for some some of the tomato bread that came in one of the Cold plates.  I was thinking it was some fancy bread with tomato baked in it but it was just a french bread with tomato sauce baked into the top of it.  \n\nFor the hot entree we had the Scallops and Hamaci Collar.  I was least impressed by the hot food.  The scallops you can get seared anywhere like this and the sauce I've had better at a Thai joint.  The Hamachi was oversalted.  I enjoyed the oyster mushrooms and rhe rainbow chard but all it all it was too buttery/oily and salty to really enjoy the delicacy of the Kama (the collar). \n\nDrinks: I had the french sauv blanc and the french pinot.  Both were fair but I've had a much smoother pinot.   \n\nMy boyfriend had the firestone ipa and the deutsches abyss imperial stout.  I have to say that the beer bottle list was extremely impressive and had we stayed longer I would have opted for one of the Belgian Ales.\n\nLastly we finished with the cheese plate.  My favorite was the blue cheese with the honey.  There were 2 others but they didn't strike me particuarly in the stink category or the texture category.  I did like the fact that the walnut bread was served cut and toasted.\n\nMy take-- I'd go back and not order the hot food.  I'd stick with the raw, the oysters and the cold.

The best of the 4 were teh dayboat scallops and then , was it the arctic char with some wasabi roe. My sis really enjoyed the fluke with the quail egg (quail eggs rule!) and a thin slice of jamon serrano(?). Finally, we ended with an overly rich yellow tomato and yellow watermelon gazpacho. It was finished with a bit too much olive oil, so after the initial 4-5 sips, it got too rich. However, the lobster salad with burrata cheese and heirloom tomatoes was scrumptious. I'd never had burrata with lobster before, and it was heaven. Yes, it still lingers in the mind. The last dish was what pushed us over our limit -- mussels in some rich tomato sauce and was it chorizo?

The mussels were drenched in butter which is normally a good thing but I thought it was just ok. The seafood chowder was good. It had a lot of good chunks of seafood in it. It was a bit on the heavier side so its definitely nice to have a lot of bread to soak this up. The rock cod were tasty. I appreciated the fish to be grilled and not battered. These were kind of expensive though and it was $10 on the happy hour menu for 2 tacos.\n\nWe also shared some items from there regular dinner menu:\nuni-avocado toast and crudo sampler for 2 which consisted of artic char, butterfish, tombo tuna and scallops.\n\nThe uni avocado toast was a bit underwhelming. I was expecting a whole piece of toast but we had two small pcs of toasted bread with the avocado smear with uni. All the flavors were very distinct. The uni was pretty fresh but the avocado tasted more like guacamole. It was tasty but I wouldn't order this again. The sampler was a great way to try all their fresh fish bites. All of the bites were ok, the tastiest crudo has to be the scallops. Soo fresh and it had bits of fresh corn on it. Yum!\n\nAll in all, it's a great spot if you are craving seafood.

The wait time was about 15-20 minutes. We were allowed to stand on the side behind the bar and order some drinks. There is a fairly large selection of beer that ranges from so-so beers to good beers. I wanted to be adventurous and try two beers I've never tried before. Unfortunately I picked two that were not really to my liking. Oh well.\n\nWe sat down for dinner and contemplated what to order. We were told that the kitchen closes in 30 minutes, so we'd have to order soon. Our waiter was very nice, amicable, and very attentive. Props for this!

Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so. Our cuts were fairly fresh, but it definitely wasn't the freshest sashimi I've had. The portions were large and usually come with 4 pieces per order, but they were able to do 5 and prorate the 5th piece proportionally. \n\n++Uni Avocado Toast - These were okay, but definitely not great. It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish. On it's own, the uni was pretty good and paired well with the avocado, but leaves you scratching your head asking what completes this dish? Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own! Other than that, the lighting is dimmed, and its very cozy and intimate. Good for small parties and perhaps dates.\n\nOverall, the service was good, and the food was decent, but I was really hoping for this place to blow my mind.

The hostess accommodated us and kindly guided us to our table - poured us cucumber infused water (yum!) and handed us the menu (HH and regular). \n\nSince we already knew what we wanted, we went ahead and ordered a few minutes later. The food came our relatively quickly (since most of it is raw) and the service was amazing! One lady kept coming over to our table to ask if everything was going alright and kept giving us bread for our sauces and soup. She was very nice and made the experience more delightful.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Miyagi Oysters $1 each\nMy bf loved his oysters (I didn't have any since I'm not a fan). He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it! Though don't get overboard cause it could get a bit salty. My bf commented that if a hot link were to be liquified, it would taste like this (the sauce). \n\n4. Crudo Sampler $13 (not on HH menu)\nCame with 4 different items: artic char, scallop, ono, and butterfish. My favorites were the artic char and the scallop. Though I didn't think it was spectacular (I think I had too high of an expectation from all the great reviews). Don't get me wrong, the fish were really fresh and the complex flavors were executed well, but I don't think I would crave for it... The ono and butterfish were too fatty and soft in texture for me. \n\n5. Seafood Chowder $5 \nNot your ordinary chowder. Not super thick, creamy, nor filling like clam chowder. It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal. Though the chowder looks small, it's packed with seafood (fish and shrimp) and potatoes! I asked for even more bread to accompany the chowder, which made it less tart-y and more delicious! :)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was great.

When we told our waiter we wanted to cancel our order but he said it was being plated (we didn't receive the bone marrow until 10 minutes after). We told him we've been waiting for a while and he said in a curt tone, \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'll just take one order off the bill.\" A simple, \"I'm sorry...\" would have sufficed but his condescending remark left us blatantly offended.

We sat at 5 and didn't revceive any food until 550 pm.  My bf and constantly checked the time.  We were here for over 2 hours.  Thats ridiculously slow for a raw bar.  When handing us the check they took 10% off because they knew how slow the service was.  I thought that was nice, but really not worth the 10%.   Alot of people contemplate between nopa and bar crudo since they are a block away from each other.  I think nopa wins hands down.

Normally, I do not prefer to have fish in my seafoood chowder, but here, the small bits of fish were, ironically, not fishy but soft and flakey.  The red potatoes were not overcooked to the point where it thickened the sauce; no, each wedge had its sharp corners still intact.  The Lobster Salad was another heavenly dish, because, ironically, even without the fresh succulent melt-in-your-mouth lobster, the heirloom tomatoes and the rich burrata cheese doused with the caper vinaigrette was truly flavorful.  \n\nIncluding the two beers, our bill was about $80 before tip.

We could have gone somewhere else, but prior to coming to Bar Crudo, i had read endless reviews on yelp and came in with *high high* expectations, and it seriously made me want to give it a try, and i swear, i was willing to wait the extra 30 minutes.\n \nI wouldn't really say this is a suitable place for a date... \nthe upstairs :  seemed rather claustrophobic, and the bottom level, well, primarily a bar area with a bunch of bar stools, can I just tell you how uncomfortable those bar stools were? In fact, I had to stand up a few times, and it was actually MORE COMFORTABLE to stand up, but what a waste to enjoy an evening, and not only that, there were people walking back and forth, including the server, because either they had to use the restroom or they were going upstairs, in other words, very chaotic, so you can't even sit comfortable.\n\nKinda has this California Wine Merchant feel (i'll write my CWM review tomorrow)... the structure of the bottom level that is...It even has this window seating area, and draws you into the back...

I'd give it a 1.5.. being the seafood lover I am, there was just too much to it, I was getting sick of it after 2 bites.)\n\nHe got the seafood chowder, which is basically clam chowder, but the seafood way with fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, bacon and such, but for $13? And to consider it as a meal of its own? 2.5 stars. It was quite tasty, but I wouldn't necessarily order it as a meal. I highly suggest getting something else as well. It was kinda thick too,  honestly, I'd rather save a few bucks and walk over to Boudins and get the original new England clam chowda! but if you like dipping your food in sauces, the complimentary bread they give you tastes actually super yummy with this seafood chowder.\n\nOverall, this place was SO bad that we stopped ordering after 2. yea, it was THAT bad... :x\n\nParking: a block away.  we stayed for 2 hours, and it was less than $5, for a parking structure, that's the cheapest i've seen in SF...\n\nService: rather slow, and the server was slightly annoying, but I'll pass... ask me about it if you really care.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nBasically, bottom line, this place is OVERLY HYPED on yelp, and I was VERY disappointed.\n\nI really REALLLY wanted to like this place, and i even wished after a few bites that it would magically turn into a 4 or 5 star like everyone else...

He told us to wait near the bar so the host can seat us. After we sat, Drew came back and ask us how was our day. Friendly, personal, and a great way to start our anniversary dinner. He also told us that we still apply to the happy hour special since we are early.  \n\nDrinks - Lambrusco sparkling red wine by the glass.\n\nWife wanted some sweet dessert wine (not for paring the seafood), but more for a good night out. With the recommendation, it wasn't bad.  I opt for just your normal water by the glass.\n\nOur first arrival - 1/2 Dozen Miyagi oysters from Tomales Bay, 4 Kumamoto from Washington. \n\nThe Special on this selection was the $1 Miyagi Oyster from Tomales Bay. We thought to give it a try. Along with the happy hour special, my wife loves Kumamoto and we proceed in ordering them on the main menu. The Oyster came on a chilled filled iced, and 6 Oysters on the left and the other half on the right. The middle center were two small dip sauce with a slice of lemon to wake th Oyster up.  \n\nWe must say, the Miyagi Oyster is by far tasty than the Kumamoto. It had a better taste, and more rich of freshness. A good way to start the seafood catch. \n\u00a0\nSecond arrival - Peel & Eat Gulf Prawns.  \n\nWe ordered four and our vision of Gulf Prawns where the black giant tiger prawns.  Boy were we wrong! As it arrived, we didn't think much of it until we took a double take. Is this Gulf Prawn? It wasn't bad in size but it wasn't giant size also. Your typical Prawn steam an chilled, then served on ice with dipping sauce with lemon at the center.\n\u00a0\nThird arrival - Crudo for Two: \nArctic char - horseradish creme fraiche, Wasabi tobiko, dill.  Scallop - corn puree, radish, chive.  Butterfish - pickled fennel, espellete pepper, Basile.  Tombo tuna - citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko\n\nWow. What a fresh taste! The the butterfish with a little hint of spice from the espellete pepper made your tongue sensor go wild and then calm with the mixture of Basile and fennel into the mix. The citrus and chili in the Tambo tuna lighten the mouth with fruit texture and a clean popping wash of the yuzu tobiko on each bite. The Arctic char had the smokey taste but a small clear of the noise of the Wasabi tobiko. And finally, the scallop is so fresh that it melt in your mouth on each bite. No need to chew like a gum, it just melt!   \n\u00a0\nForth arrival - Lobster and Tomato Salad: Burrata, little gems, corn, banyuls vinaigrette.\n\nThis dish is refreshing and light. It had all the right mixture but wished it had a little more lobster. But overall, a nice light dish to pack into the balance meal with greens/veggies.\n\u00a0\nFifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\nWe shared a large Chowder bowl and it was under the happy hour pricing. Can't beat that! The wifey said she could have passed on this dish, but I enjoyed it. It is different from other Chowder bowls we've tried, but it is just a little salty. If you didn't get bread on the side, it is a must to balance off the saltiness that comes from the Bacon, Cream, and Butter? \n\nSixth arrival - Roasted Crab: scallions, aleppo pepper, chili, verjus, tarrgon.\n\nWe wanted to give the crab a try as some reviewer mention it is a taste to try. Since we are here for seafood, why not! The Aleppo pepper and chili sure pack some heat to this dish. I like it but it is really messy. We were advise to be dirty when chowing down on this dish and we continued to say, bring it on. The crab isnt big and with each bite brought a good heat to the mouth and the tomato base tried to smooth out the heat. Overall, we will pass on this dish.\n\u00a0\nSeventh arrival - Crude for Two.\nWhat can we say, we wanted round #2 and nothing will explain more than Yum!\n\u00a0\nFinal arrival - Truffles on the house. \nWhat a surprise and Drew gave us House made Truffles for our Happy Anniversary dinner. All I have to say, it was tasty and sweet! The last taste of the night and it was good.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nA local small seafood hangout and must try during happy hours. We left with a fulfilled night out and all the dishes ordered were good to great.

It is a cross between New England + Lobster Bisque + chilis so the slightly spicy bite to the soup was welcome on a blustery evening.  The chowder is also chock full of chunks of fish, shrimp, squid, potatoes and let us not forget thicker chunks of bacon.  The bowl size from the happy hour menu is more than suffice, since the soup would fill one up too quickly.\n\nThe Lobster Heirloom Tomato Salad is a beautiful mix of soft lobster chunks atop sweet slices of tomato, sandwiched with spicy bits of arugula and a creamy alabaster melding of burrata cheese.  \n\nCrudo Sampler for two has a visually stunning display of 8 pieces of fish done up in creative and artistic flair.  My favorites were the Arctic Char (horseradish cream, wasabi tobiko, dill),  Butterfish (suncrest peaches, pasilla peppers, jamon serrano, shiso), and Ono (avocado, rhubarb and jalapeno relish, micro cilantro,\nBlack lava salt).  Each one came packed with flavors, mini petit fours style.  I hope my photo does the plating justice.\n\nLast but not least, the Red Trout is an amazing fish that melts in your mouth.  The mushrooms and potatoes provide the perfect boat to support the delicate flesh of the trout.\n\nThe pricing here reflects typical for seafood spots but for the ambiance, impeccable and kind service, and overall freshness/artistic/creativeness of the menu, I give it a top 5 rating.\n\nFor dates a perfect spot.  Check out their Happy Hour menu as well.  A steal.  Just remember to get in line quickly.

Tall white walls, lots of natural wood, interesting modern art. Dim lighting. Upstairs area looks nice. Good for a romantic date, or a catch-up with an old friend.\n\nIf you happen to be catching a show at The Independent across the street later the same night (Major Lazer what whaaat!), this is a totally sweet spot to get dinner beforehand. Just make sure you allot plenty of time for the meal. \n\n~~COST~~\n$92 total (including tax & tip) for 3 starters & 2 mains, a hearty meal for two people.\n\n~~SERVICE~~\nOur server was friendly, but his presence became progressively more sparse throughout the night. \n\nFirst course (raw) came out almost immediately after we ordered. \n\nSecond course (cold) took quite a bit more time. As in: we'd finished eating, our plates were cleared, and we were sitting around wondering when it was coming out. I'd say 25-30 minutes. \n\nThen - the table next to us got the branzino, and it looked amazing. Our server notices us eyeing the menu again and magically appears by our table, wondering if we're thinking of ordering more (he wasn't being out of place at all - we did keep a menu at the table and mention this was a possibility earlier). I said we had a concert to catch and how long would the branzino take? 7 to 10 minutes. Wow, that's it? Yeah we're getting it. It looks delicious.\n\nI decide to time it. Normally I wouldn't be so anal, but I asked about the time specifically because we were in this time crunch, and the only reason I ordered this was because he *assured* us it would take 7-10 minutes. I ordered the branzino at 8:26pm. 8:36pm passes. No branzino. 8:45pm passes. A branzino comes out from the kitchen!.... and goes to the table next to us. I ask our server if our chowder is still on its way out (we had ordered this at the start of the meal. More than an hour ago). Yes, he said, it's coming. You'd think this would prompt the dish to come out. Nope. By this time my stomach is growling I'm so hungry. FINALLY the fish comes out at.. maybe 9pm? We devour it in minutes. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded a dish taking this long, but don't set a completely false expectation!!\n\nHOWEVER, at the end of the night - REDEMPTION! I'm a pretty open book and was visibly upset at how slow the service was. After we paid, our server brought out a free dessert. How totally *sweet* of him!

The flavor was on the sour side - maybe that's how chowder can be interpreted, but I like it more savory. There was a lot of good seafood, but the soup's texture seemed a little watery to me. I like it really chunky & thick. Also - could NOT taste the bacon anywhere!

I asked for even more bread to accompany the chowder, which made it less tart-y and more delicious! :)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was great.

I knew going in the portions would be minuscule but what I didn't expect was for the quality to be sub par. The ridiculously pretentious service was the straw that broke the camel's back and had me blowing steam out of my ears like Yosemite Sam as left. More on that later.\n\nF O O D\n*$1 HH OYSTERS - 1 STAR\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=or19voNlfSzL6ELQU_Dosw\nThe Pickering Passage oysters were horribly shriveled up. It was like unzipping a pair of pants only to be disappointed with \"THAT'S IT?\" and having to go on a hunt for tweezers.\n\n*SEAFOOD CHOWDER w/ Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes & Bacon (HH - $5) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=sQ3SFQES3nhEYencRoshmQ\nThe chowder was sinfully good with a nice fiery kick and smokiness at the end. I appreciated that there was spoonfuls of mussel, calamari, and shrimp; not just potatoes. \n\n*CRUDO SAMPLER FOR 2 ($25) - 2.5 STARS\n**Artic Char w/ Wasabi Tobiko & Horseradish Creme Fraiche\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=roCTfRSB3iCv_tAeTxrr1w\n**Butterfish w/ Gala Apple & Sumac Vinaigrette \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=EiMjUndYncloYwRldYZSEA\n**Hamachi w/ Shishito Aioli \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=3orZbBvhL3689qR9sn_q0w \n**Scallop w/ Blood Orange, Fennel & Tarragon\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=xmROI5g5XnAYKFnQLCgeFQ\n\nBeing a sashimi feen, the crudo platter left little to be desired. The quality was similar to that of a mediocre non-Japanese owned sushi restaurant. The accompanying ingredients overshadowed and masked the delicateness of the sashimi. The artic char was the best of the quad. Similar to sake (salmon) sashimi, it was silky smooth and the butteriness was heightened from the cream fraiche. The scallop was the worst having a distinct fishiness to it that even the herbs couldn't hide.\n\n*UNI AVOCADO TOAST w/ Sudachi (2 for $10) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=gFLibwX0EE3jCHeuFz6gWw\nTogether, the uni and avocado produced a double layer of creamy decadence but it was lacking a component to brighten up the monotone flavor. \n\n*LOBSTER SALAD w/ Beets, Burrata, Pistachio & Arugula ($18) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=I-ybpOHYz6Yeoq5JRBREuw\nI normally despise beets but this dish made me a convert. The sweet tender lobster against the milky burrata and the peppery arugula was a perfect m\u00e9nage a trios of flavors. The pistachio would have added a nice textural contrast if it had been toasted. \n\n*BONE MARROW w/ Grilled Squid, Rainbow Chard & Salsa Verde Horseradish ($14) - 1 STAR\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=MZy7Jz6klSG6j8kI75wlyA\nSeverely disappointing, the unseasoned bone marrow was overcooked and the left to sit to congeal before being served. What little bone marrow remained tasted like Crisco. \n\nS E R V I C E\nRUDE, SLOW, AND INATTENTIVE. \n\nFrom the start, the snide hostess had an obvious attitude problem. Our waiter was no better. The food took unexpectedly long to come out. After over 30 minutes of not receiving the two orders of bone marrow, we wanted to cancel it and leave as were left sitting there with a pile of empty plates on our table. When we told our waiter we wanted to cancel our order but he said it was being plated (we didn't receive the bone marrow until 10 minutes after). We told him we've been waiting for a while and he said in a curt tone, \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'll just take one order off the bill.\" A simple, \"I'm sorry...\" would have sufficed but his condescending remark left us blatantly offended. The whole time, the hostess was staring down at our table and continued to do so until we left.

We were in absolutely no way disappointed.  We were only in San Francisco for two nights and wanted to get the best seafood we could get our hands on.  \n\nWe were greeted warmly at the door at 6:30 (our reservation was for 6:45, but our bus was early).  The place was pretty packed and we were directed to a little waiting area next to the bar and offered menus while we waited for our table.\n\nAfter we were seated, another gentleman, not our server, greeted us and asked if we had any questions about the menu.  We ordered several items (everything looked so good) and he helped us pick some beers from their incredibly well-rounded list.  \n\nHe explained to us how he would course the items we ordered, beginning with the Crudo, then the salad, then the crab, and finishing with the seafood chowder, because it was very heavy and rich.  He left us the beer and wine list, in case we wanted to try something else for our second round.  My date asked if we could keep a food menu as well, in case we needed to order more food.  The gentleman smiled and said, \"Oh, no you won't,\" in a sing-songy voice as he walked away.  I suppose if we had been other people, we may have been offended, but I thought it was funny.\n\nThe Butterfish and Ahi Tuna were our favorite of the five Crudo dishes, but the others were just as fresh and flavorful.  Each fish was paired with a sauce and some kind of ingredient, specific to complementing the characteristics of the fish.  The portions are a really good size, for the price.  We had planned to get a Crudo for 2 (8 pieces, 2 of each of four fish) and an order of Ahi (4 pieces).  The gentleman who took our order suggested that we get two pieces of each fish, so that we could try each of them, so he did an Open food charge for $6 for the 2 pieces of Tuna & they were all plated together nicely.  \n\nNext came the Octopus salad, with grilled octopus.  It was lightly charred, slightly smokey, served hot, and melted in your mouth!  Delicious!\n\nAs our server, a friendly dark haired lady, cleared the salad, my date ordered one of each of the five oysters.  She was able to add these to our order in time to get them on the same serving dish as the Dungeness crab we'd ordered.  Prior to the delivery of the shellfish, she brought our sauces: drawn butter, cocktail sauce, and mignonette.  He really enjoyed the oysters (the Kumamoto and Kusshi best of the five - I don't do oysters).  The crab was firm, fresh, yum.  I've never had chilled Dungeness crab before.  It did not disappoint at all.  \n\nAs we finished the crab, we looked at each other and knew that we didn't need the two cups of Seafood Chowder we'd ordered, although it looked amazing on the table next to us.  When our server checked on us, we asked (for the first time ever in our lives) if we could cancel the chowders, or if she'd already ordered them.  She said that she hadn't yet fired them - she was waiting to finish clearing our crab.  She was very gracious about cancelling them.  I'm just hoping that she really hadn't fired them yet!  \n\nWe made up for it by ordering another round of drinks and a cheese plate for dessert.  The dressings served with the cheese (a fresh quartered fig, marmalade, and honey) were good, but we weren't crazy about the cheeses themselves.  The bleu didn't have much taste and the camembert was more bitter than I like (I'm not sure that I've ever actually had camembert before).  As this was the only item we weren't crazy about, I'm still going to give this place 5 stars.\n\nService was excellent and efficient and the food was delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced.

I had to shout to place my order and it was hard to have a decent conversation with my date. Not a great place for a first date or with kids. What a disappointment!!!

Of the crudo sampler, we both were unexpectedly very pleasantly surprised by the scallops. I'm not typically a raw scallops kind-of--girl, but these were fantastic and the sauce was lick-the-plate good! The Ono, while itself not so flavorful, was very fresh and the accompanying ingredients provided great texture. The Arctic char was good (love me some dill and creme fraiche), but it didn't live up to all the hype (don't get me wrong, I'd order it again for sure, I just expected it to be mind-blowing). Unfortunately, the onion dominated the butterfish. Overall, though, this entire dish is a burst of flavors, and definitely worth ordering on every visit!\n\nThe concept of dairy products (burrata) and seafood (lobster) together is so strange that, for me, it is almost always a non-starter. I'm glad we ordered it, however, because I wanted to try it, and I loved all of the individual ingredients in the salad (beets? good! lobster? good!! burrata? good!!) ..but for me this combination is too weird.

SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

I picked this place because I was kind of sick of French food, and pretty much unable to do Japanese, both of these due to a particularly debaucherous recent trip to Vegas. I wanted something different, so I found this place and decided to give it a shot. Boy, was that a great idea.\n\nMaking a reservation for this place was pretty easy for a Thursday at 7pm. I used OpenTable, and the whole thing went off without a hitch. We showed up, and got seated immediately by a very friendly and fashionable hostess (the servers here are all fashionably dressed! I usually don't notice these things, but here it was pretty obvious). \n\nWe started off with the sampler, and were told that if we wanted to change up the four items so we could try everything, we could. So we started out with the standard four items on the sampler: the char, the scallop, the kona kampachi, and the butterfish. The scallop needs no words. I am already partial to scallop, but this was totally fresh and the English pea puree was a great topping. The butterfish was also delicious, with the added bonus of a quail egg (which I absolutely love). The kona kampachi was also tasty, but the char was a little overpowered by the other flavors in the mix that I couldn't really taste it.  For our second round, we got the scallops and butterfish again, and tried the tuna and the fluke. The tuna had a very subtle taste of Sriracha which was definitely well done, since Sriracha has a tendency to overpower everything it's added to. The fluke was also good (and came with chicharrones!)\n\nFor the actual meal, I had the Hokkaido scallops which again didn't fail to disappoint, and the boy had the Steak Crudo. Both were really, really tasty, and didn't leave me with that heavy feeling after a meal I had grown accustomed to after returning from Vegas, which was highly appreciated.\n\nWhat sealed the deal for me was that after mentioning that it was my birthday (I know, I have no shame when it comes to such things), our server brought out a glass of dessert wine which was really, really tasty.

Don't get me wrong though, I love most seafood, raw or cooked.\n\nOur party of three got lucky with our seating because a party had cancelled so we got the downstairs right by the window.  The restaurant is pretty small and had dim lightings but luckily we got window seats so the light shone in from the outside.\n\nWe were served water with cucumber in it, which was interesting because it made the water taste more fresh and less tap!\n\nWe tried all the different kinds of OYSTERS they had.  When the waitress brought out our platter of oysters,she quickly went through which oyster was which, but it just went in one ear and out the other.  I wished there was a toothpick indicating which were which.  Anyways, the oysters tasted very fresh and was the perfect starter for our meal.\n\nThen came the CRUDO SAMPLER, which were beautifully presented and consisted of a variety of 4 different types of raw fishes...\n\nARCTIC CHAR: my two friends thought this was the second best, but it was my least favorite because I don't like horseradish nor do I like wasabi flavor. If you like your salmon with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tobiko, then you would LOVE this.\n\nHOKKAIDO SCALLOPS: it was my second favorite, while this was the other two's favorites.  We loved the texture of the scallop when you bite into it and the flavors of the pea puree along with the citrus flavor of the lime went perfect with the scallop. \n\nKONA KAMPACHI: one of my friends and I rated this as third best, while this was the least favorite for the other friend. It wasn't too bad, the fish was really fresh and I probably could have done without the citrusy flavor of the peaches and the chili lime vinaigrette.  The sprouts on top, didn't seem to help with the flavor either, could have done without that garnish.\n\nBUTTERFISH: my favorite, one of my friends' third favorite and the other's least favorite.  I just loved the combination of the butterfish with the serrano ham and the salmorejo sauce.  It was the PERFECT combination along with a quail egg. This just did it for me.  I loved the flavor and it left me wanting MORE!!\n\nNext we had the STEAK CRUDO, which was beautifully presented.  At first I was hesistant to try it, I mean I've had raw beef before at a vietnamese restaurant, but i've never had raw chunks of beef.  It made me think of cat food.  But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  It went well with their bread.  It was very nicely flavored and spiced.\n\nLOBSTER HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD: absolutely to die for!!! IT WAS THE BEST DISH WE GOT!! We all LOVED it. If you come here, you MUST order this.  Their heirloom tomatos were fresh, sweet and juicy.  The fresh mozzerella melted in my mouth.  The lobster, plump, juicy, fresh, sweet and DELICIOUS.  The vinaigrette dressing went well with everything and the greens were nice fresh and crisp.  EVERYTHING just went well together!\n\nAfter everything came out...we wanted MORE...so we ordered...\n\nMONKFISH LIVER MOUSSE: sounds disgusting, but it wasn't too bad.  It had a very unique taste to it and after awhile it became pretty addicting.  Went very well with the bread. \n\nTUNA CONFIT: Another winner in my books.  I loved the tenderness of the tuna and the mix of asparagus and fresh bell peppers it was made with.  Olives complimented well with the rest of the dish and the TOMATO bread was DELICIOUS!!! Also loved the egg, which was cooked to perfection (not too cooked, not too raw...it had a perfect yellow yolk). I could have done without the cheese though.\n\nOCTOPUS SALAD: Just didn't deliver for me.  I didn't like the taste of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I was expecting a more citrus flavor to it.\n\nThey served all the raw seafood first, then they served the cooked food.\n\nLastly we had the MANILA CLAMS: it wasn't all that great.  I actually thought the broth was a little bit on the salty side, but it tasted better when you dipped bread into it.

And, I don't mean to mean to be crude, but the seafood here is EFFING AWESOME.\n\nThe sign for the entrance can be a little tough for this place, but once you find the commanding, large windows in the front of the restaurant, the rest is easy.  For such a posh and modern looking place, service is surprisingly casual and friendly, in a good way.\n\nTo start, I had the Crudo Sampler.  The Crudo Sampler comes with an all-star lineup of Arctic Char, Hokkaido Scallops, Tombo Tuna, and Butterfish.  All the seafood tasted really fresh with unexpected, yet clean flavor combinations.\n\nThe Hokkaido Scallop was interesting with the roasted apple and celery root puree and truffle salt.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it still tasted great.  The Tombo Tuna was also a little bit on the sweet side, but the sweetness of the hazelnut and pear was balanced with a nice tartness from the pomegranate reduction.  The Butterfish was one of my favorites, topped with olive, black garlic, shiso, and an orange vinaigrette.  I don't think I would have thought any of these ingredients would go together, but somehow, they did.  The fish itself was out of this world, and only tasted better with a great mix of sweetness and acidity.\n\nThe star of the sampler, however, was the Arctic Char.  The freshness of the actual char harmonizes perfectly with the spiciness of the horseradish cream and wasabi tobiko eggs.  Top that all with a bit of dill, and you got yourself a real winner.  Overall, the sampler is the best way to get a good idea of Bar Crudo's food.\n\nI also got a Beef Tartare topped four ways.  Each was topped with either an egg yolk, hot pepper, horseradish cream, or a sardine.  All were great, and the beef was really clean and fresh, but were a little less interesting than some of the other dishes.\n\nFinally, I got the Uni Avocado Toast.  I love uni, I love avocado, and I love toast.  So I thought this would be a great combination.  And it was.  It was a little heavy on the fattiness, but a little fat never hurt anyone.  There was also a side sudachi, frisee, and herb salad.  If you have the salad on top of the uni and avocado on the toast, there's a great combination of flavors and textures.\n\nOverall, the seafood here is innovative, updated, and crude.\n\nGET:  Arctic Char", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-12-25"}, {"excerpts": ["You get 4-5 pieces of the freshest fish ever with some very appropriate garnish - the arctic char, rhode island fluke, and butterfish are favorites.\n\n"], "author": "Dan S.", "review": "Quite simply my favorite restaurant in the city.

Bar Crudo's selection of some four-dozen bottled beers, along with a handful of well-chosen taps, would put many so-called beer bars to shame. But what sets Bar Crudo apart is its happy hour food. Usually, happy hour in a bar means a few munchies, Buffalo wings, or something deep-fried and virtually unrecognizable. At Bar Crudo, a lot of the food never goes near a flame, let alone a deep fryer. Bar Crudo, as its name implies, specializes in raw dishes, mostly seafood -- six types of fresh oysters; five types of clams; and small plates of raw arctic char, butterfish, Tomba tuna, Hokkaido scallops, spicy yellowfin tuna and Hawaiian ono -- as well as steak crudo and several other \"cold\" preparations. You can also order cooked seafood, as well as delicious seafood chowder, brimming with large chunks of fish, and fish tacos ($5 at happy hour). \nWhile other restaurants conceal frozen fish under deep frying batter or buttery sauces, at Bar Crudo there's no place to hide.

My boyfriend admittedly is not a big fan of seafood. But they managed to even make him a happy fan.\nOYSTERS // Hello, top notch oysters like Washington for $1?! Hell to the yes. 1/2 a dozen just for me, thank you very much. \nHERB & JALAPENO MARINATED MUSSELS // My dude loathes raw oysters so he ordered one of these, and then two more. He liked it. I tried one and almost spat it out...trust who you will. This was the only thing I didn't love. \nROCK COD TACOS // Pretty pricy to be on the Happy Hour menu at $5 a piece, but the nicely charred cod is generously portioned and the hot sauce they use on it really gets the burn going. \nBAR CRUDO SAMPLER // Yum yum yum. The only thing we ordered not offered on the Happy Hour menu, but well worth it. Basically it's sashimi + toppings. The fish chunks are big enough that we split each one in half to share. Arctic Char (salmon), Butterfish, Yellowtail, and Scallop. All fresh and flavored superbly. You've never had sashimi this way, so try it out. \nSEAFOOD CHOWDER // Arguably their most famous, and best, dish. It is that good. Chock full of fish, squid, and shrimp and the broth is off the wall! Creamy, a little tomatoey...just wonderful. $5 a cup during HH! It's a steal. \nAlso, beer & wine for $3 and $5, respectively.\n\nTHE PLACE \nIt's pretty hipster, but in a good way. Small, clean space with interesting art adorning the walls. Our server was helpful and attentive. Food was served in the order they deemed appropriate (cold to hot). He even gave us a heads up about a Silent Disco party at the SF Zoo for the following night.

The food was completely on point.  \n\nWe started with a couple of oyster samplers, which was really fun.  Usually when I get a plate of oysters, I can't tell much of a difference, but this was totally different.  Most of our table enjoyed the Kusshi's the most because they were so silky smooth.  \n\nThen, we ordered a bunch of the raw dishes.  We got the Kona Kampachi, which was my personal favorite.  I loved the pairing with peaches, and the avocado mousse went nicely with everything to tie it together.  We also got the butterfish, scallops, and the fluke.  All of the flavors were totally different, which made everything seem like a great tasting menu. \n\nWe got the lobster tomato salad with burrata, which was so delicious.  To be fair though, I love anything with burrata.  We also got the whole dungeness crab.  Here's where I think the service could have been a little bit better.  First of all, we got crab crackers to help us get the meat out, but it would have been really great if we also got a crab pick/scoop.  Using our regular fork was a little too unwieldy.  Plus, the busboy took away the butter before the whole table was done eating, so we requested more, but it took a little bit of time.  Also, at the end of the crab, it would have been really nice to get some wipes or a finger bowl to clean our hands.  I mean, c'mon, we just ate a whole crab with our hands.  We did end up getting bread, but only after we asked for it after seeing it on other tables.  \n\nFinally, we got to the hot portion of the meal:  devil prawns, scallops in coconut curry sauce, and the seafood chowder.  Due to the bacon flavor and overall depth of the chowder sauce, I believe I told the table if I spilled some of the broth on my arm, I would most likely go Donner party on myself. \n\nOverall, since we were eating some great quality seafood, and our table went a little crazy with the booze, I knew the bill would be on the more expensive side.  I have to say I felt like this restaurant totally deserved it though, because the food we had really was quite commendable.  I am not the type of person who eats a ton of fish outside of sushi, and the variety and interesting mix of flavors on this menu were able to keep me totally engaged throughout.  \n\nMy one last comment on this place though was they didn't have anything to offer for dessert, which was disappointing.

As many suggested, we went during Happy Hour and ordered a number of items both from that menu as well as from their regular menu.  What we both enjoyed was the crudo sampler for 2.  My favorite from both weeks was the butterfish, so rich and full or flavor.  I also thought the seafood chowder was delicious both weeks and included a wide variety of seafood that is hard to beat at $5 a cup (HH price).  From the 1st week, I also loved the uni toast, with the perfect amount of very fresh sea urchin on the bread.  The dozen HH oysters were very good each time but quite tiny.  So we'll probably skip that the next time we go.  The HH red wine is very drinkable at $5 a glass.  The lobster beet salad that we ordered on the 2nd visit was a mixed bag for me.  I thought the lobster meat was overcooked but the beets were perfect.  My partner, however, thought it was just right.  So I guess it's a mild recommendation for the dish.  \n\nThis location is definitely an improvement from their previous one on top of the Stockton tunnel.  The servers are friendly and efficient.

But my mate said it was alright.\n\nCrudo Sampler :\nDayboat Scallops - they were good, fresh and sweet.\nArtic Char - we both agreed that this was the most amazing thing of the night. everything that went along with it was PERFECT. \nButterfish - this was very good too. Butterfish as usual, is very smooth and soft.\nTombo Tuna - the tuna itself was alright but I really liked the crunchy topping on top of it (whatever it was).\n\nLobster Tomato Salad - pretty good, but parts of it was a little overwhelming, but nonetheless delicious.\n\nManila Clams - this was a hot dish, but this was probably the least special dish out of the whole night.\n\nSeafood Chowder - 2 bowls (not a smart idea). I liked the shrimp in it and the sausage (smoked bacon), but I didn't like the fish, squid and mussels. The soup base was good, but too milky/creamy. I think its making me feel a little uneasy now.\n\nBasically, the crudo sampler was amazing, with the artic char being my favorite. The lobster salad was good, but I might or might not order that again. I'll lay off the clam chowder and manila clams next time (both hot dishes). On the full-o-meter, I was about a 8, which is very, very good. A 9 or 10 would definitely mean overly, cannot walk full.

I must say this place did not disappoint.  We started with the oysters and the crudo sampler, moved on to the cold dishes (Lobster Salad and San Sebastian) and finally the hot dishes (Seafood chowder, the scallops and the trout.)\n\nCrudo - My favorite was the arctic char.  Very buttery and went well with the horseradish dressing.  The scallop and the butterfish were also very good. The salt on the scallop really helped bring out the flavor.  The kampachi was decent but I didn't eating the lime skin with the fish.  \n\nLobster Salad - Mirroring most of the other yelp reviews, the mixture between the lobster and the burratta was perfect.  I could have just had this dish for the whole meal.  \n\nSan Sebastian - The dressing they used worked really well with the tuna.  Kind of a vinegrette taste but very light.  The manchego and the broche went well with the fish as well.  The fish was a little dry but still had good flavors.  \n\nSeafood Chowder - Verrrrry rich!  I believe this is a chowder that needs to be shared.  After a few spoonfuls it becomes too much.  The seafood inside was cooked well though.  A lot of times seafood is overcooked in soups and is very dry but this chowder seemed to maintain the moisture very well.  \n\nScallops - The spicy sauce added a nice kick and really brought the flavors out.  I would have liked the scallops to be cooked a little less as I thought they were a bit overcooked but the flavors were still excellent.  \n\nTrout - We were initially not going to order this but our waitress highly recommended it.  I have never had trout that was so good before.  Very tender and very moist this dish could have been the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe service was decent.

It looked it, too.\nI was eating up the hype, the 4.5 Yelp rating, the thought of $1 local seafood fare... And, I ordered accordingly.\nA dozen platter of oysters (per person... oh, I can take it), a shared cup of the chowder, a glass of the buttery sweet house white, and last but not least: the crudo sampler.\nThe only way I can describe my palette's reaction was: disappointment.\n* The oysters were still a bit glistening, iced, accompanied with delicious sauces, but several were the fat, creamy, very \"sons of the sea\" one might say, and a bit hard to put down. I don't know, maybe that's just luck, and honestly for $1 each I don't mind at all. But, at the end of the day it definitely stuck with me.\n* The seafood chowder was quite tasty, very savory, very rich. Maybe a little too rich; it was a tempting color, spoonfuls were satisfying, but I don't know if I would say I \"loved it\". I think it needed just a tad more balance, there was a tang that I really loved but it wasn't enough to cut the cream, the bacon overload and the fattiness of the mussels and octopus. It was truly Americana, and I may crave this on a cold misty San Francisco evening--but I'd need a friend to share just a cup with, for fear of clogging my arteries.\n* The wine was delicious. Seriously. I have nothing bad to say about it. Great pick for a house white.\n* The greatest disappointment was the crudo. Name a restaurant after a particular dish and one expects the dish to be the highlight of the meal. It certainly was not. Apple celery root paste as a condiment? It was akin to baby food placed on a luxurious piece of sashimi. I was eating with Christine L and not one sample did we enjoy.

Perhaps if I had only ordered a dozen oysters and a glass, I would have been happy--it would have been a pleasurable and worthwhile $20. But, instead I spent roughly over $35 to include the very lackluster crudo. The soup, just needed a little tweaking--but the crudo? Just bring out the fish next time.

Our waitress said she checked with the executive chefs and told us they said that the 1 1/4 lb lobsters are just \"running small\" and that there was no mistake.  While 1 1/4 lb is absolutely the ideal size for a Maine lobster, there's no such thing as a healthy Maine lobster without claws.\n\nI told her that their story was untrue, and she left us for a bit.  We then saw her huddling with a bunch of people who worked there, and she eventually came back to us saying oops - the chefs said that we actually received a \"deformed lobster\" and she wouldn't charge us for it.

Not served on ice like i've seen at other places.  \n\nWe had the Crudo Sampler and ate in order of spiciness as I had asked the server who brought it. \n\nStarted with the butterfish.  I really enjoyed the black garlic that this came with.  However it was not a melt in your mouth butterfish. Next was the scallop with the celery puree.  This was my favorite.  The scallop was the perfect size and the puree didn't over dominate the scallop.  We then had the tuna.  This was my least favorite.  It was too salty and it was an odd mix of pear/hazelnut with the salt.  Finally finished with the Arctic char and the horsey and wasabi and dill.  I enjoyed the heat in the nose but the char was big and it was chewey.\n\nI asked for some some of the tomato bread that came in one of the Cold plates.  I was thinking it was some fancy bread with tomato baked in it but it was just a french bread with tomato sauce baked into the top of it.  \n\nFor the hot entree we had the Scallops and Hamaci Collar.  I was least impressed by the hot food.  The scallops you can get seared anywhere like this and the sauce I've had better at a Thai joint.  The Hamachi was oversalted.  I enjoyed the oyster mushrooms and rhe rainbow chard but all it all it was too buttery/oily and salty to really enjoy the delicacy of the Kama (the collar). \n\nDrinks: I had the french sauv blanc and the french pinot.  Both were fair but I've had a much smoother pinot.   \n\nMy boyfriend had the firestone ipa and the deutsches abyss imperial stout.  I have to say that the beer bottle list was extremely impressive and had we stayed longer I would have opted for one of the Belgian Ales.\n\nLastly we finished with the cheese plate.  My favorite was the blue cheese with the honey.  There were 2 others but they didn't strike me particuarly in the stink category or the texture category.  I did like the fact that the walnut bread was served cut and toasted.\n\nMy take-- I'd go back and not order the hot food.  I'd stick with the raw, the oysters and the cold.

Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

Bar Crudo was high up on this list and may I state upfront, that my experience here also reflects the positivity.  I am known to shy away from seafood spots but this is now my favorite to-go-to in the event I am craving truly fresh and creative bites.\n\nFantastic happy hour menu and dinner menu in general.  Since my date is a regular, he proceeded to order from both menus: we started off with the Seafood Chowder (bowl), the Lobster Heirloom Tomato Salad, the Crudo Sampler for two, and Idaho Red Trout.\n\nFirst off, the seafood chowder here is exquisite.  It is a cross between New England + Lobster Bisque + chilis so the slightly spicy bite to the soup was welcome on a blustery evening.  The chowder is also chock full of chunks of fish, shrimp, squid, potatoes and let us not forget thicker chunks of bacon.  The bowl size from the happy hour menu is more than suffice, since the soup would fill one up too quickly.\n\nThe Lobster Heirloom Tomato Salad is a beautiful mix of soft lobster chunks atop sweet slices of tomato, sandwiched with spicy bits of arugula and a creamy alabaster melding of burrata cheese.  \n\nCrudo Sampler for two has a visually stunning display of 8 pieces of fish done up in creative and artistic flair.  My favorites were the Arctic Char (horseradish cream, wasabi tobiko, dill),  Butterfish (suncrest peaches, pasilla peppers, jamon serrano, shiso), and Ono (avocado, rhubarb and jalapeno relish, micro cilantro,\nBlack lava salt).  Each one came packed with flavors, mini petit fours style.  I hope my photo does the plating justice.\n\nLast but not least, the Red Trout is an amazing fish that melts in your mouth.  The mushrooms and potatoes provide the perfect boat to support the delicate flesh of the trout.\n\nThe pricing here reflects typical for seafood spots but for the ambiance, impeccable and kind service, and overall freshness/artistic/creativeness of the menu, I give it a top 5 rating.\n\nFor dates a perfect spot.

As in: we'd finished eating, our plates were cleared, and we were sitting around wondering when it was coming out. I'd say 25-30 minutes. \n\nThen - the table next to us got the branzino, and it looked amazing. Our server notices us eyeing the menu again and magically appears by our table, wondering if we're thinking of ordering more (he wasn't being out of place at all - we did keep a menu at the table and mention this was a possibility earlier). I said we had a concert to catch and how long would the branzino take? 7 to 10 minutes. Wow, that's it? Yeah we're getting it. It looks delicious.\n\nI decide to time it. Normally I wouldn't be so anal, but I asked about the time specifically because we were in this time crunch, and the only reason I ordered this was because he *assured* us it would take 7-10 minutes. I ordered the branzino at 8:26pm. 8:36pm passes. No branzino. 8:45pm passes. A branzino comes out from the kitchen!.... and goes to the table next to us. I ask our server if our chowder is still on its way out (we had ordered this at the start of the meal. More than an hour ago). Yes, he said, it's coming. You'd think this would prompt the dish to come out. Nope. By this time my stomach is growling I'm so hungry. FINALLY the fish comes out at.. maybe 9pm? We devour it in minutes. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded a dish taking this long, but don't set a completely false expectation!!\n\nHOWEVER, at the end of the night - REDEMPTION! I'm a pretty open book and was visibly upset at how slow the service was. After we paid, our server brought out a free dessert. How totally *sweet* of him!

The flavor was on the sour side - maybe that's how chowder can be interpreted, but I like it more savory. There was a lot of good seafood, but the soup's texture seemed a little watery to me.

Reservations at 6 meant just in time to squeeze in happy hour (which ends at 6:30), and the soup-loving parentals dug the $5 seafood chowder cups.\n\nThe chowder came chocked with seafood goodness, while the bacon-infused broth reminded me more of a thick, hearty bisque than a brothy, satisfying soup. Other happy hour priced bar bites included the shishito peppers (meh), the spicy-tinged marinated mussels (liked the spice), and $1 oysters.\n\nThe dinner menu proved more promising, if more expensive. The menu is sparse, split into three entree-ish sections: raw, cold, hot. Like many a modern restaurant, dishes aren't meant to be eaten in traditional appetizer to entree form. Mixing in a big group is preferable.\n\nThe raw dishes are perhaps Bar Crudo's finest offerings, a take on sashimi that clearly screams Asian fusion. We tried five of six, leaving off the most traditional Ahi Tuna cube. The creme fraiche Char is reportedly the house favorite. I most dug the Ono and its sweet-spicy-sour grapefruit-jalapeno complement, while the table fawned over the Fluke and Quail Egg, heavily laced with truffle oil. Word of caution: these bad boys are neither cheap nor filling.\n\nCold dishes were forgettable. I wouldn't order either the San Sebastian (tuna confit with various side dishes) or the lobster beet salad again, though the lobster chunks were thick and hearty.\n\nThe sauce for the head-on Louisiana Prawns was spicily delicious, though being from so close to the Gulf, I'd call it more \"Franks Red Hot\" than \"Lousiana Hot Sauce\" spicy. The whole roasted Branzino was a crowd-pleaser for this Asian table, and a very good dish to share for a large party.\n\nI was set to award Bar Crudo five stars until a visit to the nothing short of incredible Swan Oyster Depot the next day. The freshness of Swan put Bar Crudo to shame, and it was easy to see some of Bar Crudo's more egregious errors.

He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it!

It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal.

After warming up with a very innocent (Yelp, you know I wouldn't lie to you!) game of battleship and dessert at Candybar, we went to Bar Crudo for dinner.  \n\nOur waitress gifted us with lovely service; when I explained I have a preference for creamy oysters over briny ones, she chose the Kumamoto,  Effingham and Chelsea Gem varieties for us.  I have yet to find a place that serves oysters as good as the ones I had in New Orleans, but Bar Crudo definitely has some of the better oysters in the SF Bay Area.  \n\nFor our raw entrees, we shared the Yellowtail Jack and Ono dishes.  The Ono was divine!  I've never had ono (aka cousin of mackerel) in any form before, so this was a great introduction. One might argue that the jalapeno relish or cilantro masked the true taste of the fish, but who cares?  The unique combinations of flavors in the dishes here is what makes it stand out from other seafood bars.  This also holds true for Head-On (yes, your food will be staring at you if you order this) Deviled Prawns with the chiles, shishito prawns, spicy brodo and the San Sebastian tuna confit.  In fact, everything else on the plate saved the tuna confit dish, as the tuna was strangely bland for confit.  \n\nSo how did the evening with Nice Boy end?  Like a gentleman, he walked me to my place an entire block away and leaned in for a first kiss on what was not a first date.  In that split second, I remembered what I just ate, ducked and cursed the raw fish and accompanying spices for taking away my confidence to go for it, despite my minty gum-chewing.  Nice Boy looked at me with his big brown eyes filled with confusion as he settled for a goodnight hug.\n\nSo Diary (*bleep*, I meant \"Yelp\"), I think I messed that one up.  \n\nBut the food at Bar Crudo was good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["How do they make arctic char, scallop, butterfish, and ono taste ", "so good every time?

We got there about 6pm so Happy Hour was still in effect until 6:30pm. We ordered a dozen of raw oysters ($1 each), seafood chowder ($6) and manila clams ($6). The oysters were good but not great but we were happy that it was only $1 each. The seafood chowder had a lot of seafood in one little bowl but I thought it was just mediocre b/c they used too much heavy cream and was a bit too sour. The manila clams were delicious and probably the best item on the menu. The broth was very tasty and there was a good amount of clams.  When we were done with our HH meals, we ordered from the dinner menu - had the crudo sampler for two ($28), half a dozen of raw little neck clams ($2.50 each) and the lobster salad ($18)...all disappointments!!! The presentation of the food was beautiful but deceiving!!! It definitely looked better than it tasted. The crudo sampler had the arctic char (salmon), scallop, butterfish and ono.

I noticed that everyone who gave great ratings only came for the happy hour and was happy with their HH food. If I came for their HH food, I think I would've given them a better rating too. But the people who ate their dinner were disappointed like me. I wouldn't mind paying top dollar for good tasting high quality food. At Bar Crudo, the seafood is not fresh, the food is not tasty and the price is too high for such low quality small portions. I do have to say they have great customer service. We were well attended and our host and server were both were friendly and attentive. Their complimentary bread and cucumber water was good. \n\nI forgot to mention the noise level at this place in CRAZY noisy. It's not even a big place but everyone was talking so loud. I had to shout to place my order and it was hard to have a decent conversation with my date. Not a great place for a first date or with kids. What a disappointment!!! I felt like I wasted my money coming here. Go try Mission Rock Resort for their raw oysters and little neck clams...so much fresher and with a great view.

This was a perfect amount of food for the two of us!\n\nAll of the crudo samples were extremely fresh. You can tell the quality of the fish is superb. Of the crudo sampler, we both were unexpectedly very pleasantly surprised by the scallops. I'm not typically a raw scallops kind-of--girl, but these were fantastic and the sauce was lick-the-plate good!

I'm glad we ordered it, however, because I wanted to try it, and I loved all of the individual ingredients in the salad (beets? good! lobster? good!! burrata? good!!) ..but for me this combination is too weird.

Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order.

Toronado, of course, has $1 off draft beers from opening until 6 p.m. At Lucky 13 in San Francisco, you can drink fresh Pliny the Elder, Dogfish Head 90, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Anchor Liberty and many more for $3 a pint from opening until 8:30 p.m. Most other beer bars offer some variation of a happy hour from around 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. or so. (Don't forget to tip $1 per beer.)\nBut one of the best happy hours in the city isn't even at a beer bar; it's at Bar Crudo on Divisadero. Bar Crudo's selection of some four-dozen bottled beers, along with a handful of well-chosen taps, would put many so-called beer bars to shame. But what sets Bar Crudo apart is its happy hour food. Usually, happy hour in a bar means a few munchies, Buffalo wings, or something deep-fried and virtually unrecognizable. At Bar Crudo, a lot of the food never goes near a flame, let alone a deep fryer. Bar Crudo, as its name implies, specializes in raw dishes, mostly seafood -- six types of fresh oysters; five types of clams; and small plates of raw arctic char, butterfish, Tomba tuna, Hokkaido scallops, spicy yellowfin tuna and Hawaiian ono -- as well as steak crudo and several other \"cold\" preparations. You can also order cooked seafood, as well as delicious seafood chowder, brimming with large chunks of fish, and fish tacos ($5 at happy hour). \nWhile other restaurants conceal frozen fish under deep frying batter or buttery sauces, at Bar Crudo there's no place to hide. Preparation is subtle and minimal, allowing the fish to be the star of the show.  \nThe lineup of five draft beers matches well with the food: Moonlight Brewing Reality Czech ($3 a pint during a happy hour recently), Allagash White Belgian-style wit beer (which adds some spritzy, subtly lemony zest to the oysters and raw seafood), Firestone Walker Solace, Russian River IPA and the 30th anniversary stout from Sierra Nevada and Anchor Brewing.

It was even more enjoyable to have plump juicy chunks of lobster primed for my consumption without having to decorticate it myself. \n\nThe seafood chowder was everything I hoped for and very richly garnered all the prior praise from others' reviews.

My mid-year resolution: add a final Yelp step to the process.  Bar Crudo is my first.\n\nI was solo tonight, and lucky me there was a single seat at the bar which was not reserved.  I love sitting at an oyster or sushi bar, right in the middle of the action, and I like it even more if the people behind the bar serve booze.

I opted for the only Pinot (Noir in this review and all others) on the menu, which came in a bottle that had a cap instead of a cork.  I'll never get used to that; I don't care how \"green\" it is.\n\nI decided to start with the Crudo sampler appetizer.  I'm pretty sure that I was the first person who put an order in for the evening, however, the wait time was way too long.  Maybe not that long in crudo minutes, but certainly long in normal appetizer minutes.  It's ok though, because while I am waiting, I get to witness the spectrum of skill level in oyster shucking.  First guy, coulda done it blindfolded.  Second guy, I coulda used a blindfold, as I was certain this guy would slice his finger off before the dozenth oyster was open.\n\nI understood the wait time when the sampler arrived.  There were four kinds of crudo, each more delicate and intricate than the previous.  The one I was really excited about trying was the Hawaiian Ono, which had lemongrass, citrus, mint, chili, tobiko, and more on it.  I LOVE all of those things.  Did I love all those things together?  Not so much.  I expected some sort of crazy crudo chemical reaction in my mouth, which didn't happen.  Instead, it just tasted like a bunch of random ingredients thrown together for an experiment.

After the third bite, however, I was certain that I could replicate the chowder at home with a pint of cream and a few sticks of butter.  The chowder was so rich, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens (unless I'm on a first date.)\n\nLet me close with what I'd tell MB if he was interested in my Crudopinion:  Bauer, they're on to you.

The Lobster salad was one of the best tasting I've ever had (it didn't hurt that it was served with Heirloom tomatoes).\nThe mussels (and I'm the furthest things from a fan of gooey, chewy seafood) were quite tasty and my new favorite food item, thanks to Bar Crudo, is Hawaiian Ono (served with an amazing citrus sauce and sprouts).  Unreal.  \n\nThe service at the counter was fantastic, easy going and quick.  It was cool to watch the chefs shuck oysters and make our food.  The space is intimate (i.e.: small), but I like that about it.  A perfect place to catch up with old friends and have a glass of wine and some good food.

Not in my book), recommended Bar Crudo to me.  My boyfriend Joel and I were feeling a tad uninspired about life last night, so we stopped in at this establishment on the way home to pamper our tastebuds and generally lift our sagging spirits. \n\nDue to the impromptu nature of our visit there was no room in the main restaurant (a good sign on a random Tuesday), so we sat by the bar in the window, which proved to be a good spot. The ambience didn't grab me at first but grew on me during the course of the night. Was that linked to wine consumption? Hard to say.\n\nWe ordered a lovely 2005 Pouilly Fume ($42) to kick things off, which struck the right balance between minerality and fruit, making it a useful pairing with our food. There were less expensive wines on the menu - but remember, I was feeling sorry for myself.\n\nWe launched into the meal with a couple of crudo plates (raw fish). The restaurant takes pride in layering unusual flavors in its dishes, so while I'm a perennial sucker for spicy yellowfin tuna, I succumbed to our waiter's pitch on trying some of the more adventurous, less standard concoctions.\n\nFirst up was the Tombo Tuna ($12 for four pieces), complemented with lobster oil, pineapple vanilla vinaigrette, chervil, Himalayan pepper. The vanilla was quite potent but other than that, this one came across a little bland and lacking in flavor - not a wholly successful ensemble. \n\nThe Hawaiian Ono, on the other hand, was quite delectable. The fish was beautifully presented, melt-in-the-mouth and matched up with lemongrass, citrus, chili, daikon sprout, enoki mushroom, mint, cilantro, and yuzu tobiko. The citrus gave a nice zing to the dish, the tobiko popped in the mouth and the chili provided a welcome bite ($12 for 4 pieces).\n\nFor the main event, Joel went with the seafood chowder ($13). Honestly, I'm not a huge chowder fan but I had to send the waiter away, twice, while I ended up practically finishing the bowl. The addictive ingredient that made me want this chowder over others? Probably the applewood smoked bacon. Bacon makes everything better. \n\nMeanwhile, I opted for the lobster salad ($15) featuring pistachio oil,  chiogga beets and some soft sliced mozzarella-like cheese, among other goodies I'm sure. This was also a successful combo - the oil was used sparingly enough that it didn't overwhelm, the lobster chunks were succulent, the cheese provided a dreamy backdrop, and beets generally make me happy, particularly when presented in two colors.\n \nBy the end of our meal, our tastebuds felt duly treated and we were definitely feeling better about life. We cabbed it home to indulge in chocolate truffles while watching the movie \"Match Point\". Yep, I'm spoiled.

I love the delicateness of a fresh fish with sauces that bring out the taste of the fish, not overpower it.  This definitely is the place.  We had 2 glasses of champagne and a bottle of white wine since I didn't want to get anything red to overpower the taste of the fish.  We started with 3 types of oysters.  Very fresh, and each had a unique flavor.  The waitress was really well versed in describing them to us.  Then we had the Crudo sampler, in which they let us substitute the scallop for fluke.  Everything was amazing.  The sauces and little spices complimented the amazingly fresh fish very well.  The tombo tuna melted in our mouths.  The fluke had a little bit of caviar to add a little touch of saltiness which it needed.  We also had the arctic char which had a type of wasabi paste on it which gave it an amazing flavor kick.  The fish was cut perfectly too, not too small and not too big.  \nIt's a very small place with great service, nothing lacked.  We ended with the Ono in which it wasn't as good as the others though.

I had wanted to go here for what seems like FOREVER, so when we pulled up in front of Bar Crudo to start our evening, I was ecstatic and almost jumped out of the car before he could come to a full stop to drop me off!\n\nWe shared a bottle of Riesling over delectable Kushi oysters and Bluepoints that they had in stock for that evening.  You have to request horseradish separately, which is something I never did understand for any place that serves fresh oysters, but what they bring you is perfectly grated FRESH horseradish.  Crudo menu is fantastic - most notable was the Kanpachi crudo dish.  Four thick slivers of fresh, raw fish, with some nuts and a lovely, slightly tart huckleberry sauce drizzled over it.  It's a remarkable bundle of tastes.  This particular fish has a bit less flavor than typical yellowtail sashimi, but that actually allows the accompaniments to bring it to life, whereas the typical yellowtail sashimi's buttery flavor would kill the accompaniments that grace this dish.  Gazpacho was refreshing - -  a bit of seafood in the middle with a fresh, watermelon-infused cold soup.  Really nice.  We ordered more things - and everything was just truly fresh -  and flavorful.  Bar Crudo really knows how to dress up their raw seafood - - and presents it in a fashion that makes it look so appealing.\n\nService was very good, and even when it became a full house, we never felt neglected.  I should mention the water they gave us - - - somehow, without any change in color, I could taste a bit of watermelon flavor in the water.  I can't say I liked the water itself - - but what it did do at room temperature was serve as palate cleanser everytime you took a swig.  When dealing with a crudo menu - - this served most useful.  Fascinating... I'd have never thought of it.\n\n***********************************************\nSecond time:\n\nAnother night out to dinner w/ Archie the Manly Man.\nThis  time, we order champagne, which I always enjoy with oysters.  The champagne was no Veuve Cliquot, but a Brut 1+1=3.  Really, that was what it was called, and our server recommended it, so we accepted.  Great, it was not, but it got us pretty buzzed so it did what it was supposed to do.\nI was out to challenge Archie's allegedly newfound love of oysters, which he claimed at our last dinner at Ella where I had to twist his arm to get him to try raw oysters.  We'll see.  First, we order Kushi oysters - but they are out, so we end up getting Luna and something else, which name I cannot recall.  Oysters were good but not as good as last time.  I dress my oyster, Archie follows point by point.  I eat - - he eats.  Wow.  He actually does look like he's enjoying oysters.... Reminder to self, take this blossoming oyster-lover-wannabe to Hog Island one day.\n\nGiven this was his first time, I didn't want to risk ordering anything new and ruining his experience here, so I opted to order much of the same as last time, but fewer items as this was only an appetizer for us before the real dinner.  \nEverything was as good as the first time - -  but they had run out of Gazpacho, which was too bad because I really did enjoy that soup last time.  Most notable this night was the scallops w' corn puree..  The Konpachi was good but not as good as  the first time.  The Ono we had was very tasty... but again, it's the freshness that is really impressive.\n\nThere was no watermelon-flavored water, though.\n\n***********************************************\n\nBar Crudo is a place that is more appealing as a \"let's have a drink and get some good appetizer\" place rather than a full dinner location.  Very fresh fish, and I'd dare to guess that the majority of the things on their menu will be good.\nIt is expensive, though.  If you love raw seafood like I do, it can run way beyond $100 pp if you eat here in hopes of filling yourself.  I would just recommend you come here for a plate or three of appetizers, have a couple drinks and be off to a real dinner, like I did on both occasions.\nThe dining area upstairs is very small, and the seafood bar downstairs, while pleasant, is also small.  Make reservations if you want a table, they're available on www.opentable.com and I've had no problems getting one thus far.\n\nBut food aside - what makes Bar Crudo amazing is that in all this time, I have NEVER, EVER seen such an extensive list of Belgian Beers available, from Chimay Blue, Stella, etc.  There must be at least 40 different kinds of Belgian Ales available, a variety of IPAs and double IPAs, etc.  I daresay you'd be hardpressed to find this many Belgian Beers in one place outside of Brussels or something.\n\nFor that alone - BC would get 5 stars, but add in the fresh fish, and you might as well call it \"BAR GRACE\"!!!!\n\n\nThis is the good life, folks.... give it a whirl.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-10-07"}, {"excerpts": ["All the food we had -- three varieties of oysters, prawns, chowder, and ono (a must to try!)

There's bar seating, some table seating and standing tables downstairs and a few tables upstairs. Definitely make a reservation if you have a group. Ambiance was lively and trendy yet cozy at the same time. Good for most occasions, casual and special. \n\nWe ordered mostly off the happy hour menu, which has some pretty good deals. The $1 oysters are a must, of course! We ended up getting 2 rounds of 2 dozen oysters, the shishito peppers and some of the group got the seafood chowder off the HH menu, and a few of us shared some of the crudos off the regular menu.\n\n* OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL ($1 each @ HH) - 5/5\nIf you love oysters, you'll love their $1 happy hour oysters.

Simple, not too greasy like other shishito peppers I've had, and topped with a few tender anchovies (boquerones).\n\n* KONA KAMPACHI CRUDO ($14 for 4) - 5/5\n[orange, fennel pollen, orange oil] \nSo buttery soft, the kampachi basically just melts in your mouth.

The mussels were drenched in butter which is normally a good thing but I thought it was just ok. The seafood chowder was good. It had a lot of good chunks of seafood in it. It was a bit on the heavier side so its definitely nice to have a lot of bread to soak this up. The rock cod were tasty. I appreciated the fish to be grilled and not battered. These were kind of expensive though and it was $10 on the happy hour menu for 2 tacos.\n\nWe also shared some items from there regular dinner menu:\nuni-avocado toast and crudo sampler for 2 which consisted of artic char, butterfish, tombo tuna and scallops.\n\nThe uni avocado toast was a bit underwhelming. I was expecting a whole piece of toast but we had two small pcs of toasted bread with the avocado smear with uni. All the flavors were very distinct. The uni was pretty fresh but the avocado tasted more like guacamole. It was tasty but I wouldn't order this again. The sampler was a great way to try all their fresh fish bites. All of the bites were ok, the tastiest crudo has to be the scallops. Soo fresh and it had bits of fresh corn on it. Yum!\n\nAll in all, it's a great spot if you are craving seafood.

While she is pouring, he tells me about the area of Cinque Terre's small coastal villages in region of Liguria in the province of La Spezia. I'm enchanted by my glass of wine and loving hearing about where it's from. \n\nNext up, the Lobster Beet salad, with gold and chiogga beets, burrata, mache, pistachios, banyuls vinaigrette. Very Beautiful and light. So delicious. \n\nThen to finish, the Seafood Chowder, which was perfection in itself. I don't think I have ever had anything like it and have thought about it quite a lot since that day.

AND, if you do end up on a waitlist of some sort, there's plenty of bars and cafe's nearby in NOPA (The Mill, Candybar, Flybar etc.)\n\nOur server was incredibly kind and patient with us as we selected what wine by the glass we wanted. You can try the various wines they serve by the glass before deciding. We ended up selecting a Gruner that was light, crisp and mineraly to go with the seafood.\n\nThe atmosphere for dinner on that day was very East Coast yacht club-y.

The hostess accommodated us and kindly guided us to our table - poured us cucumber infused water (yum!) and handed us the menu (HH and regular). \n\nSince we already knew what we wanted, we went ahead and ordered a few minutes later. The food came our relatively quickly (since most of it is raw) and the service was amazing! One lady kept coming over to our table to ask if everything was going alright and kept giving us bread for our sauces and soup. She was very nice and made the experience more delightful.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Miyagi Oysters $1 each\nMy bf loved his oysters (I didn't have any since I'm not a fan). He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it! Though don't get overboard cause it could get a bit salty. My bf commented that if a hot link were to be liquified, it would taste like this (the sauce). \n\n4.

Though I didn't think it was spectacular (I think I had too high of an expectation from all the great reviews). Don't get me wrong, the fish were really fresh and the complex flavors were executed well, but I don't think I would crave for it... The ono and butterfish were too fatty and soft in texture for me. \n\n5. Seafood Chowder $5 \nNot your ordinary chowder. Not super thick, creamy, nor filling like clam chowder. It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal. Though the chowder looks small, it's packed with seafood (fish and shrimp) and potatoes! I asked for even more bread to accompany the chowder, which made it less tart-y and more delicious! :)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was great. Prices are good for seafood, but portions are pretty small. We managed to spend almost $50 for our pre-dinner happy hour snack....

When we told our waiter we wanted to cancel our order but he said it was being plated (we didn't receive the bone marrow until 10 minutes after). We told him we've been waiting for a while and he said in a curt tone, \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'll just take one order off the bill.\" A simple, \"I'm sorry...\" would have sufficed but his condescending remark left us blatantly offended. The whole time, the hostess was staring down at our table and continued to do so until we left.

Even the bathroom came with an extra tiny sink (it was so cute I wanted to steal it!).\n\nAlmost everything here was severely overpriced, but I maintain that the experience was worth it. \n\nI came here a couple of years ago with a gaggle of friends for an SF weekend getaway (despite the fact that we lived right in the Bay Area not forty minutes away from the city of rainbow awesomeness). Using business traveler's points, we got to stay at the InterContinental in a luxurious suite. Woot! And since we had foodies in the group, we decided that Bar Crudo would be a great place for a nice dinner.\n\nAfter strolling around Chinatown for a bit, we came here and had to wait outside in the icy wind for our table. Damn, and we even had reservations! 20 minutes passed and finally we were seated on the second floor at a table next to the window.\n\nThe interior was warm and cozy, and the soft lighting really added to the atmosphere. Still, I had to stumble around a bunch of seated patrons just to get up those small stairs and into my seat. What a pain.\n\nUpon being seated, our server did the standard duty of pouring us water. But this wasn't just any ordinary water. This wasn't just ice water or lemon water; it was cucumber water! I had never before thought that putting a slice of cucumber into a pitcher of water would impart such a refreshing taste, but it was possibly the best water I've ever had. How often do you hear someone say that?\n\nAnyway, onto the food:\n\n- Crudo Sampler: the biggest ripoff ever. Yeah, the seafood was fresh, but for $23 I expected a little more than 8 pieces. Quite frankly, there's a point where the freshness isn't worth the extra money (my personal take on the law of diminishing returns).\n\n- Seafood Chowder: HOLY FUCKING SHIT GET THIS! In fact, get two or three whole bowls for yourself! It's been maybe 3 years since I've been here and I still daydream about this stuff. Rich, creamy, hearty, laced with delicious chunks of applewood smoked bacon. This was totally worth the money because 1. it actually filled me, and 2. it was orgasmic. Bar Crudo's seafood chowder has got to be the best chowder I've had in my life thus far.\n\nSure, you can easily spend $50+ here on tiny bites of their seafood, but why not save that money and spend it elsewhere at some made-to-order AYCE sushi joint (which only costs about half that)?

I loved the modern atmosphere, the abstract art on the walls, and it has a pretty large bar and cool bathrooms.\n\nThe two of us weren't that hungry but probably should've ordered at least two or three more items before deciding on the Crudo Sampler and a medium Platter.  Both were pretty good; made with awesome, fresh ingredients and interesting fundamentals.  The Sampler came with Artic Char which was my favorite - it came with a really good Wasabi, that reminded me of the texture of fish eggs.  The tuna was also good, topped with diced up pears! The butterfish was just alright, it's a stronger fish and had a garlicky-parsley kick going on.  The scallops were weird...I don't really like the texture of scallops, let alone raw scallops, but I definitely didn't like the sauce - just a not so memorable, bland horseradish sauce. \n\nThe Platter was much better (more my style) - consisted of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams! Yum.  All were super tasty and I especially loved the 3 sauces that accompanied it! \n\nService was OK, she was pretty non existent after bringing over the bottle of wine and taking our order.

Again, all the seafood in it was fantastic (& plentiful).

I preferred the fresh fish dishes we had.\n\nThe only vegetarian dish on the menu is the artisanal cheese plate, which our non-seafood, non-vegan friend enjoyed. For our totally vegan friend, the chef actually improvised an all-vegetable dish for her, which she loved and said was excellent, so mad props there.\n\nMy only real complaint was the noise. As with many, many other SF restaurants I've been in, there was basically no sound baffling anywhere so it was really loud & difficult to have a conversation across the table.

There is no front desk at the front door.  So when you enter on a busy service, you are immediately standing in btwn tables.  There is no host and the servers are busy keying in orders and bills about 20ft to the right at the end of the bar.  So I just stood there waiting to be helped.  Servers walked pass me several times to the tables but never looked or asked me anything even though I looked lost and out of place.  ONE CHECKMARK AGAINST THE HOUSE!  After determining that their workflow is poor, I decided to approach them at the bar area.\n\nOnce I did that then it was fine.  \"I was in the loop finally.\"  I was asked to order a drink while I waited for my dinner compadre to arrive.\n\nThe rest of dinner was a fun night of trying their Crudo sampler which was very interesting on the palate.

Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

I just thought cooked seafood. Don't get me wrong though, I love most seafood, raw or cooked.\n\nOur party of three got lucky with our seating because a party had cancelled so we got the downstairs right by the window.  The restaurant is pretty small and had dim lightings but luckily we got window seats so the light shone in from the outside.\n\nWe were served water with cucumber in it, which was interesting because it made the water taste more fresh and less tap!\n\nWe tried all the different kinds of OYSTERS they had.  When the waitress brought out our platter of oysters,she quickly went through which oyster was which, but it just went in one ear and out the other.  I wished there was a toothpick indicating which were which.  Anyways, the oysters tasted very fresh and was the perfect starter for our meal.\n\nThen came the CRUDO SAMPLER, which were beautifully presented and consisted of a variety of 4 different types of raw fishes...\n\nARCTIC CHAR: my two friends thought this was the second best, but it was my least favorite because I don't like horseradish nor do I like wasabi flavor. If you like your salmon with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tobiko, then you would LOVE this.\n\nHOKKAIDO SCALLOPS: it was my second favorite, while this was the other two's favorites.  We loved the texture of the scallop when you bite into it and the flavors of the pea puree along with the citrus flavor of the lime went perfect with the scallop. \n\nKONA KAMPACHI: one of my friends and I rated this as third best, while this was the least favorite for the other friend. It wasn't too bad, the fish was really fresh and I probably could have done without the citrusy flavor of the peaches and the chili lime vinaigrette.  The sprouts on top, didn't seem to help with the flavor either, could have done without that garnish.\n\nBUTTERFISH: my favorite, one of my friends' third favorite and the other's least favorite.  I just loved the combination of the butterfish with the serrano ham and the salmorejo sauce.  It was the PERFECT combination along with a quail egg. This just did it for me.  I loved the flavor and it left me wanting MORE!!\n\nNext we had the STEAK CRUDO, which was beautifully presented.  At first I was hesistant to try it, I mean I've had raw beef before at a vietnamese restaurant, but i've never had raw chunks of beef.  It made me think of cat food.  But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  It went well with their bread.  It was very nicely flavored and spiced.\n\nLOBSTER HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD: absolutely to die for!!! IT WAS THE BEST DISH WE GOT!! We all LOVED it. If you come here, you MUST order this.  Their heirloom tomatos were fresh, sweet and juicy.  The fresh mozzerella melted in my mouth.  The lobster, plump, juicy, fresh, sweet and DELICIOUS.  The vinaigrette dressing went well with everything and the greens were nice fresh and crisp.  EVERYTHING just went well together!\n\nAfter everything came out...we wanted MORE...so we ordered...\n\nMONKFISH LIVER MOUSSE: sounds disgusting, but it wasn't too bad.  It had a very unique taste to it and after awhile it became pretty addicting.  Went very well with the bread. \n\nTUNA CONFIT: Another winner in my books.  I loved the tenderness of the tuna and the mix of asparagus and fresh bell peppers it was made with.  Olives complimented well with the rest of the dish and the TOMATO bread was DELICIOUS!!! Also loved the egg, which was cooked to perfection (not too cooked, not too raw...it had a perfect yellow yolk). I could have done without the cheese though.\n\nOCTOPUS SALAD: Just didn't deliver for me.  I didn't like the taste of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I was expecting a more citrus flavor to it.\n\nThey served all the raw seafood first, then they served the cooked food.\n\nLastly we had the MANILA CLAMS: it wasn't all that great.  I actually thought the broth was a little bit on the salty side, but it tasted better when you dipped bread into it. Nothing too special for me.\n\nI was very impressed with their service, the presentation as well as the taste of the food.

And, I don't mean to mean to be crude, but the seafood here is EFFING AWESOME.\n\nThe sign for the entrance can be a little tough for this place, but once you find the commanding, large windows in the front of the restaurant, the rest is easy.  For such a posh and modern looking place, service is surprisingly casual and friendly, in a good way.\n\nTo start, I had the Crudo Sampler.  The Crudo Sampler comes with an all-star lineup of Arctic Char, Hokkaido Scallops, Tombo Tuna, and Butterfish.  All the seafood tasted really fresh with unexpected, yet clean flavor combinations.\n\nThe Hokkaido Scallop was interesting with the roasted apple and celery root puree and truffle salt.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it still tasted great.  The Tombo Tuna was also a little bit on the sweet side, but the sweetness of the hazelnut and pear was balanced with a nice tartness from the pomegranate reduction.  The Butterfish was one of my favorites, topped with olive, black garlic, shiso, and an orange vinaigrette.  I don't think I would have thought any of these ingredients would go together, but somehow, they did.  The fish itself was out of this world, and only tasted better with a great mix of sweetness and acidity.\n\nThe star of the sampler, however, was the Arctic Char.  The freshness of the actual char harmonizes perfectly with the spiciness of the horseradish cream and wasabi tobiko eggs.  Top that all with a bit of dill, and you got yourself a real winner.  Overall, the sampler is the best way to get a good idea of Bar Crudo's food.\n\nI also got a Beef Tartare topped four ways.  Each was topped with either an egg yolk, hot pepper, horseradish cream, or a sardine.  All were great, and the beef was really clean and fresh, but were a little less interesting than some of the other dishes.\n\nFinally, I got the Uni Avocado Toast.  I love uni, I love avocado, and I love toast.  So I thought this would be a great combination.  And it was.  It was a little heavy on the fattiness, but a little fat never hurt anyone.  There was also a side sudachi, frisee, and herb salad.  If you have the salad on top of the uni and avocado on the toast, there's a great combination of flavors and textures.\n\nOverall, the seafood here is innovative, updated, and crude.\n\nGET:  Arctic Char", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-12-25"}, {"excerpts": ["The chowder was smoky and delish, we loved the crudo sampler plate, and the cold seafood was all top notch.

Star chefs will do a menu featuring a particular ingredient or preparation; examples that come to mind: skatewing, foie gras corndogs, sunchokes, kanapachi, wagyu, foam, raw, you get the idea.  Soon everyone is doing it until it is overexposed like certain young Hollywood stars.  Bar Crudo is a trendsetter; watch for many to follow in their very capable footsteps.

The restaurant storefront is small and unassuming too -- I missed the place completely on my first pass. It's a spare, modern sort of place with metallic(ish) fixtures, tables etc. -- feels a bit like what I imagine a Swedish or Icelandic restaurant would be like (with the seafood dishes too...!) Place wasnt full - there were probably a dozen other people in the place.\n\nWe got started -- I didnt really know what a \"raw bar\" was. After a bit of an explanation from the waitress, i discovered that (surprise!) a lot of the fish and seafood dishes are raw! Turns out, this is really raw, with a few minimal garnishments. I found it quite a bit more difficult to manage than sushi, for example. \n\nWe ordered the half Dungness Crab, followed by the \"Crudo Sampler\" of raw fish -- interesting, but somehow a bit unsatisfying. Finally, a couple of hot (cooked) dishes -- a cup of the very good chowder, and the scallops, also very tasty. \n\nGood enough, without being memorable.

Also, the shellfish was extra slippery as it was coated in semi-solidified butter. Be careful. \n\nA few recommendations when you come here:\n\n1) Even though they say that the hot items are entree side.  Trust me, they are not.  The Seared Hokkaido Scallops dish was 4 small scallops on a thin layer of coconut sauce with some alfalfa sprouts sprinkled on top.  No starch to make it an entree. \n\n2) If you're hungry be ready to order a lot of items as everything comes in very small tapas-style portions.\n\n3) The bathroom lighting is extremely dim.  I was worried I might miss the toilet  but luckily the years of practice saved me here. If you plan to reapply makeup you just may come out looking like Mimi if you're not careful. \n\n4) If you make a reservation - add 30 minutes to your travel time for parking.

The only thing we ordered not offered on the Happy Hour menu, but well worth it. Basically it's sashimi + toppings. The fish chunks are big enough that we split each one in half to share. Arctic Char (salmon), Butterfish, Yellowtail, and Scallop. All fresh and flavored superbly. You've never had sashimi this way, so try it out. \nSEAFOOD CHOWDER // Arguably their most famous, and best, dish. It is that good. Chock full of fish, squid, and shrimp and the broth is off the wall! Creamy, a little tomatoey...just wonderful. $5 a cup during HH! It's a steal. \nAlso, beer & wine for $3 and $5, respectively.\n\nTHE PLACE \nIt's pretty hipster, but in a good way. Small, clean space with interesting art adorning the walls.

I met up with some good friends tonight for a quick bite at Bar Crudo and all i can say is the seafood chowder might be the new choice for my last meal on earth. Sorry mom!  The silky cream broth is flavored with applewood smoked bacon, mussels, shrimp, squid, and fresh fish to order with a well balanced ratio of potatoes.  It is perfectly seasoned and will redefine chowder as you know it.  Have you ever fantasized about sitting in a champagne filled hot-tub surrounded by attractive, naked models?  New fantasy: sitting in a hot-tub filled with Bar Crudo's seafood chowder surrounded by large soup spoons (naked models & bread optional).  Oh, and don't even bother with the small bowl - do yourself a favor and order the large bowl to avoid any regrets.\n\nI also tried the crudo sampler and it was ridiculous.  The fish was VERY fresh and each sample was quite different from one another.

Sure, I have tried oysters (not really my thing- but how can you blame me, being from the Midwest?), and those are presented not really in a Latin or Japanese fashion- but for the most part- raw fish was always something that I would have only at those two types of places.\n\nNow- I simply have to think back to that cold August evening when I went with my fiance (now wife) to try this place out to remember how limited my food experiences have been.  It was eyeopening, and almost maddening for me to realize that such wonderfully creative presentations can be done- but only with the finest and freshest fish and shell fish around.  It was a wonderful, and yet frustrating experience- realizing that living in Chicago limits me to this type of food that I really love and now consider to be one of the best ways of presenting raw seafood.\n\nCrudo being the Italian word for raw, we somewhat expected things to be presented with that type of background.  I guess one could interpret it that way a bit- but only in the sense that truly great Italian cooks will only use things that are fresh, accessibly local, and in season- and Bar Crudo does this.  The chefs allowing the ingredients to sing for themselves, without manipulating the flavors through various cooking methods is a terrific way of experiencing the freshness and liveliness of such high quality ingredients.\n\nTo top off the crudo experience (in which we shared quite a few oysters as well ad the Crudo Sampler), we had ordered one of their hot dishes- in which we got grilled jaw/cheek of something (tuna maybe) and this too was wonderfully flavored, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience.

Rather disappointed the horseradish did not have a stronger kick to it.  \n\n* Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Cubes - Like a high class Hawaiian Poke!  I would have enjoyed a bit more spice, but I can see it taking away from the high quality, deep red tuna.  Green onions added a wonderful compliment.\n\n* Tombo Tuna - Quite refreshing!  This part of the review will be lacking as it wasn't a very memorable sample.\n\nWe went surf 'n turf here and also got the Steak Crudo, a series of semi-raw steak topped with various tastes.  The poached egg should be popped so the meat could marinate in the yolk.  This is a classic tartare or steak and eggs froofy younger brother.  I loved the simplicity of the pipparas and beef... spicy sweet with fatty beef.  These tastes are made for each other.  All this served with toasted crutons to cut the richness.  And you know the bits of peppercress aren't just good garnish, they should be eaten with the beef and fish.  Think of it as a tiny salad.  \n\nA thoroughly great experience here.  Service was patient (we came just 30 minutes before closing) and very cordial.  He asked that we must come back for their seafood chowder... we shall.

Determined to try all restaurants that have made the cut, I've been to 31 so far.  But, the experience has not felt complete... something is missing.  My mid-year resolution: add a final Yelp step to the process.  Bar Crudo is my first.\n\nI was solo tonight, and lucky me there was a single seat at the bar which was not reserved.  I love sitting at an oyster or sushi bar, right in the middle of the action, and I like it even more if the people behind the bar serve booze.  As I people-watched, I noticed that I seemed to be the only person without a reservation, which was a surprise to me considering it was a Monday night at 6 pm.  I bet this place gets crudo crazy later in the week.\n\nThe wine list was fairly unimpressive, although the beer selection was crudonculous.  I opted for the only Pinot (Noir in this review and all others) on the menu, which came in a bottle that had a cap instead of a cork.  I'll never get used to that; I don't care how \"green\" it is.\n\nI decided to start with the Crudo sampler appetizer.  I'm pretty sure that I was the first person who put an order in for the evening, however, the wait time was way too long.  Maybe not that long in crudo minutes, but certainly long in normal appetizer minutes.  It's ok though, because while I am waiting, I get to witness the spectrum of skill level in oyster shucking.  First guy, coulda done it blindfolded.  Second guy, I coulda used a blindfold, as I was certain this guy would slice his finger off before the dozenth oyster was open.\n\nI understood the wait time when the sampler arrived.  There were four kinds of crudo, each more delicate and intricate than the previous.  The one I was really excited about trying was the Hawaiian Ono, which had lemongrass, citrus, mint, chili, tobiko, and more on it.  I LOVE all of those things.  Did I love all those things together?  Not so much.  I expected some sort of crazy crudo chemical reaction in my mouth, which didn't happen.  Instead, it just tasted like a bunch of random ingredients thrown together for an experiment.  Very disappointing.  Thank goodness for the second crudo - the arctic char, which had just a few logical ingredients and was heaven.  In my industry, I'd recommend the KISS technique to the Crudoians.... Keep It Simple, Stupid; sometimes less is more.\n\nIt was cold outside, and there were only a couple of hot dishes on the menu.  I opted for a small seafood chowder, which was surprisingly large.  The first bite was beautiful, and I decided Bauer was onto something.  After the third bite, however, I was certain that I could replicate the chowder at home with a pint of cream and a few sticks of butter.  The chowder was so rich, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens (unless I'm on a first date.)\n\nLet me close with what I'd tell MB if he was interested in my Crudopinion:  Bauer, they're on to you.  They know who you are, and/or they know when you are coming.  I bet they have some \"special\" they offer you that is not on the menu when you're there, am I right?  There was no special for me tonight.  This place was good, but I'm not sure it was Top 100 good.

I believe this is a chowder that needs to be shared.  After a few spoonfuls it becomes too much.  The seafood inside was cooked well though.

I would have liked the scallops to be cooked a little less as I thought they were a bit overcooked but the flavors were still excellent.  \n\nTrout - We were initially not going to order this but our waitress highly recommended it.

And the name. Bar Crudo. It just sounded so sexy; when I arrived I immediately picked up on the layout of the restaurant, the cute details like the stand tables with hooks, black and cream color scheme, contemporary artwork and sexy yet cartoonish sketches on the walls...\nNow, not only did it sound sexy. It looked it, too.\nI was eating up the hype, the 4.5 Yelp rating, the thought of $1 local seafood fare... And, I ordered accordingly.\nA dozen platter of oysters (per person... oh, I can take it), a shared cup of the chowder, a glass of the buttery sweet house white, and last but not least: the crudo sampler.\nThe only way I can describe my palette's reaction was: disappointment.\n* The oysters were still a bit glistening, iced, accompanied with delicious sauces, but several were the fat, creamy, very \"sons of the sea\" one might say, and a bit hard to put down. I don't know, maybe that's just luck, and honestly for $1 each I don't mind at all. But, at the end of the day it definitely stuck with me.\n* The seafood chowder was quite tasty, very savory, very rich. Maybe a little too rich; it was a tempting color, spoonfuls were satisfying, but I don't know if I would say I \"loved it\". I think it needed just a tad more balance, there was a tang that I really loved but it wasn't enough to cut the cream, the bacon overload and the fattiness of the mussels and octopus. It was truly Americana, and I may crave this on a cold misty San Francisco evening--but I'd need a friend to share just a cup with, for fear of clogging my arteries.\n* The wine was delicious. Seriously. I have nothing bad to say about it. Great pick for a house white.\n* The greatest disappointment was the crudo. Name a restaurant after a particular dish and one expects the dish to be the highlight of the meal. It certainly was not. Apple celery root paste as a condiment? It was akin to baby food placed on a luxurious piece of sashimi. I was eating with Christine L and not one sample did we enjoy. The butterfish, tuna, and scallops were flavorful but they were dressed in a manner that we could only describe taste wise as \"...interesting\". The last crudo was hardly memorable at all, the fish being oddly bland and the coconut sauce far from inspiring.\nI loved the space, the service was excellent, and the idea of the $1 oyster plus delicious $5 wine Happy Hour. Perhaps if I had only ordered a dozen oysters and a glass, I would have been happy--it would have been a pleasurable and worthwhile $20. But, instead I spent roughly over $35 to include the very lackluster crudo. The soup, just needed a little tweaking--but the crudo? Just bring out the fish next time. Just the fish.\nA hit and miss menu brings Crudo's points down a notch, but overall: a great location for Happy Hour, decent place for slightly expensive seafood, best for groups of 3 or fewer.

The red potatoes were not overcooked to the point where it thickened the sauce; no, each wedge had its sharp corners still intact.  The Lobster Salad was another heavenly dish, because, ironically, even without the fresh succulent melt-in-your-mouth lobster, the heirloom tomatoes and the rich burrata cheese doused with the caper vinaigrette was truly flavorful.  \n\nIncluding the two beers, our bill was about $80 before tip.

The combination of lobster and the sweetness of the beets was a delicious surprise.\n\nWe ended with the seafood chowder which was fantastic!  Honestly, by the time we got to the chowder to end our meal, I really didn't have any room left in my stomach, but to not eat the chowder would've been a bigger crime than to be overstuffed!\n\nThey do not have dessert at Bar Crudo so if you are celebrating, you can be like my bf and bring a cake yourself.

Not served on ice like i've seen at other places.  \n\nWe had the Crudo Sampler and ate in order of spiciness as I had asked the server who brought it. \n\nStarted with the butterfish.  I really enjoyed the black garlic that this came with.  However it was not a melt in your mouth butterfish. Next was the scallop with the celery puree.  This was my favorite.  The scallop was the perfect size and the puree didn't over dominate the scallop.  We then had the tuna.  This was my least favorite.  It was too salty and it was an odd mix of pear/hazelnut with the salt.  Finally finished with the Arctic char and the horsey and wasabi and dill.  I enjoyed the heat in the nose but the char was big and it was chewey.\n\nI asked for some some of the tomato bread that came in one of the Cold plates.  I was thinking it was some fancy bread with tomato baked in it but it was just a french bread with tomato sauce baked into the top of it.  \n\nFor the hot entree we had the Scallops and Hamaci Collar.  I was least impressed by the hot food.  The scallops you can get seared anywhere like this and the sauce I've had better at a Thai joint.  The Hamachi was oversalted.  I enjoyed the oyster mushrooms and rhe rainbow chard but all it all it was too buttery/oily and salty to really enjoy the delicacy of the Kama (the collar). \n\nDrinks: I had the french sauv blanc and the french pinot.  Both were fair but I've had a much smoother pinot.   \n\nMy boyfriend had the firestone ipa and the deutsches abyss imperial stout.  I have to say that the beer bottle list was extremely impressive and had we stayed longer I would have opted for one of the Belgian Ales.\n\nLastly we finished with the cheese plate.  My favorite was the blue cheese with the honey.  There were 2 others but they didn't strike me particuarly in the stink category or the texture category.  I did like the fact that the walnut bread was served cut and toasted.\n\nMy take-- I'd go back and not order the hot food.  I'd stick with the raw, the oysters and the cold.  I doubt i'd eat the platter since I could easily go to an asian seafood restaurant and get the same if not seasoned better and way cheaper (if you want shrimp, crab, mussels, etc.)", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Last night I sat next to a girl who ordered a huge seafood platter, the crudo sampler, and the chowder.

What's great too is that you get a view of Bush St. below with all the comings and goings -- tourists and Tunnel Top drinkers. \n\nSecond, we got really good, attentive, and assured service. It's a cramped space, but the servers do not rush things. They (and the kitchen) are good at bringing things out at a good pace, not rushing, and trying not to crowd the small tables too much.\n\nThird, the food is very good and interesting. We split the small seafood platter. When we expressed interest in a variety of oysters, the server suggested adding a more complete selection for a slight added cost. We feasted on raw oysters, raw clams, one of the best mussels i've ever tasted, big prawns, and excellent, fresh Dungeness crab. Afterwards, a bar crudo sampler.

"], "author": "David G.", "review": "Good things often come in small packages. I'm not sure if that's the case, but when speaking of Bar Crudo, it's right on the money. Opened in November 2005, by twin brothers Mike (the chef) and Tim (the house manager) Selvera, Bar Crudo has taken the raw-bar food craze to a new level. Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane. As the evening was rather chilly on my first visit, I tried the marvelously rich seafood chowder with lots of fresh clams, fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, red potatoes, and smoky applewood smoked bacon ($10). Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster. The crudo (raw fish) is the main focus of the menu and includes gloriously spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha, and green onions ($12); Rhode Island black bass with hard quail egg, habanero tobiko and blood orange reduction ($9); and not-to-be-missed arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill ($10). In case you don't like seafood, try the artisan cheese plate with flower honey, seasonal fruit, medjool dates, and nutty walnut bread ($11) and the sherry duck liver mousse with green pepper corns, cornichons and grilled bread. Their rich flavors and tempting texture blend nicely together.  And if you're indecisive about what to have for dessert, don't worry. There's only one item available on the menu, decadent XOX truffles ($6) that were definitely worth the wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to dine alone, or perhaps with your friends or someone special, Bar Crudo's delicious seafood and quaint atmosphere are definitely a winning combination.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["A member of our party ordered the half Maine lobster, which arrived with half of the tail, half of the carapace, and no claws (obviously a part of all Maine lobsters) at all.

Don't get me wrong though, I love most seafood, raw or cooked.\n\nOur party of three got lucky with our seating because a party had cancelled so we got the downstairs right by the window.  The restaurant is pretty small and had dim lightings but luckily we got window seats so the light shone in from the outside.\n\nWe were served water with cucumber in it, which was interesting because it made the water taste more fresh and less tap!\n\nWe tried all the different kinds of OYSTERS they had.  When the waitress brought out our platter of oysters,she quickly went through which oyster was which, but it just went in one ear and out the other.  I wished there was a toothpick indicating which were which.  Anyways, the oysters tasted very fresh and was the perfect starter for our meal.\n\nThen came the CRUDO SAMPLER, which were beautifully presented and consisted of a variety of 4 different types of raw fishes...\n\nARCTIC CHAR: my two friends thought this was the second best, but it was my least favorite because I don't like horseradish nor do I like wasabi flavor. If you like your salmon with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tobiko, then you would LOVE this.\n\nHOKKAIDO SCALLOPS: it was my second favorite, while this was the other two's favorites.  We loved the texture of the scallop when you bite into it and the flavors of the pea puree along with the citrus flavor of the lime went perfect with the scallop. \n\nKONA KAMPACHI: one of my friends and I rated this as third best, while this was the least favorite for the other friend. It wasn't too bad, the fish was really fresh and I probably could have done without the citrusy flavor of the peaches and the chili lime vinaigrette.  The sprouts on top, didn't seem to help with the flavor either, could have done without that garnish.\n\nBUTTERFISH: my favorite, one of my friends' third favorite and the other's least favorite.  I just loved the combination of the butterfish with the serrano ham and the salmorejo sauce.  It was the PERFECT combination along with a quail egg. This just did it for me.  I loved the flavor and it left me wanting MORE!!\n\nNext we had the STEAK CRUDO, which was beautifully presented.  At first I was hesistant to try it, I mean I've had raw beef before at a vietnamese restaurant, but i've never had raw chunks of beef.  It made me think of cat food.  But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  It went well with their bread.  It was very nicely flavored and spiced.\n\nLOBSTER HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD: absolutely to die for!!! IT WAS THE BEST DISH WE GOT!! We all LOVED it. If you come here, you MUST order this.  Their heirloom tomatos were fresh, sweet and juicy.  The fresh mozzerella melted in my mouth.  The lobster, plump, juicy, fresh, sweet and DELICIOUS.  The vinaigrette dressing went well with everything and the greens were nice fresh and crisp.  EVERYTHING just went well together!\n\nAfter everything came out...we wanted MORE...so we ordered...\n\nMONKFISH LIVER MOUSSE: sounds disgusting, but it wasn't too bad.  It had a very unique taste to it and after awhile it became pretty addicting.  Went very well with the bread. \n\nTUNA CONFIT: Another winner in my books.  I loved the tenderness of the tuna and the mix of asparagus and fresh bell peppers it was made with.  Olives complimented well with the rest of the dish and the TOMATO bread was DELICIOUS!!! Also loved the egg, which was cooked to perfection (not too cooked, not too raw...it had a perfect yellow yolk). I could have done without the cheese though.\n\nOCTOPUS SALAD: Just didn't deliver for me.  I didn't like the taste of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I was expecting a more citrus flavor to it.\n\nThey served all the raw seafood first, then they served the cooked food.\n\nLastly we had the MANILA CLAMS: it wasn't all that great.  I actually thought the broth was a little bit on the salty side, but it tasted better when you dipped bread into it. Nothing too special for me.\n\nI was very impressed with their service, the presentation as well as the taste of the food.

Reservations at 6 meant just in time to squeeze in happy hour (which ends at 6:30), and the soup-loving parentals dug the $5 seafood chowder cups.\n\nThe chowder came chocked with seafood goodness, while the bacon-infused broth reminded me more of a thick, hearty bisque than a brothy, satisfying soup. Other happy hour priced bar bites included the shishito peppers (meh), the spicy-tinged marinated mussels (liked the spice), and $1 oysters.\n\nThe dinner menu proved more promising, if more expensive. The menu is sparse, split into three entree-ish sections: raw, cold, hot. Like many a modern restaurant, dishes aren't meant to be eaten in traditional appetizer to entree form. Mixing in a big group is preferable.\n\nThe raw dishes are perhaps Bar Crudo's finest offerings, a take on sashimi that clearly screams Asian fusion. We tried five of six, leaving off the most traditional Ahi Tuna cube. The creme fraiche Char is reportedly the house favorite. I most dug the Ono and its sweet-spicy-sour grapefruit-jalapeno complement, while the table fawned over the Fluke and Quail Egg, heavily laced with truffle oil. Word of caution: these bad boys are neither cheap nor filling.\n\nCold dishes were forgettable. I wouldn't order either the San Sebastian (tuna confit with various side dishes) or the lobster beet salad again, though the lobster chunks were thick and hearty.\n\nThe sauce for the head-on Louisiana Prawns was spicily delicious, though being from so close to the Gulf, I'd call it more \"Franks Red Hot\" than \"Lousiana Hot Sauce\" spicy.

With a reasonably large number of by-the-glass and by-the-bottle selections, it avoids the \"usual suspects\" in favor of lesser known, but menu-appropriate, choices from Germany, Italy, and France.  A highlight is the beer menu--a virtual tome, consisting of more than 50 selections from the light and refreshing Reality Czeck to The Abyss, an imperial stout.\n\nService is attentive, informed, and helpful.  Water glasses were not left empty, and servers provided excellent food and beverage recommendations--staff training is obviously a priority at Bar Crudo.\n\nWhile some of the food is raw, the cooking and service at Bar Crudo are not.  This place is the real deal:  reasonable (for The City) prices, good service, and great food in a trendy, up-and-coming neighborhood.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. "], "author": "Tammy H.", "review": "i am truly in love with this place. Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

Not because I dislike the food:  on the contrary, I'm haunted by it.  And certainly not because it's so busy:  some barriers are worth overcoming.\n\nI go because a visit to Bar Crudo cannot be normal circumstances:  the food, the drink, the staff, even the guests, they conspire to create the special, the unusual, the unexpected--anything but the normal.  Something about being small, being sexy, being (somehow) secret--and having neither space nor seconds to throw SF's vegetarians a bone.\n\nMost recently I sat at the bar alone, between two young German men working their way through two thirds of the short but sweet menu, and a blonde who was performing for the couple that formed her dining companion.  I ate perfect lobster with burrata and the San Sebastian, a dish that tastes like Spain as I wish it was.  You can sit alone at Bar Crudo:  you will not be bored, you will not be lonely.\n\nBut sitting with someone else is ideal.  I've both rejected and been rejected by women I took to Bar Crudo:  in all cases it's been a high point, in no cases were the regrets over food, service, or decor. Once I even came back after dropping her off, to drown my sorrows in beer and salted fish. Maybe it's because Bar Crudo exemplifies so many human virtues:  economy (a small menu from a smaller kitchen, every item quietly excellent), warmth (the lovely staff, front and back of house) persistence (recovery from a car crash that injured half their staff), precision (delicate yet effective salting, cucumbers in the water, timely seating in such a small space).  \n\nI won't pretend to fully understand the magic that Bar Crudo creates:  suffice to say it sets a high bar.

We started trying 2 of each oyster that was available and they were all types I had never tried before. The standout ones were the Olympia oysters from Washington and like the restaurant, packed a punch for their small size. We also ordered prawns which were cooked perfectly and delish.  The oysters were probably the best part of the meal, but mainly because I absolutely adore oysters and can eat several dozen in one sitting! \n\nWe ordered the crudo sampler which was great because it gave us a little bit of variety.  I really enjoyed the arctic char and the butterfish.  The monkfish liver mousse was very delicious as well.

I believe this is a chowder that needs to be shared.  After a few spoonfuls it becomes too much.  The seafood inside was cooked well though.  A lot of times seafood is overcooked in soups and is very dry but this chowder seemed to maintain the moisture very well.  \n\nScallops - The spicy sauce added a nice kick and really brought the flavors out.  I would have liked the scallops to be cooked a little less as I thought they were a bit overcooked but the flavors were still excellent.  \n\nTrout - We were initially not going to order this but our waitress highly recommended it.  I have never had trout that was so good before.  Very tender and very moist this dish could have been the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe service was decent.

The crudo sampler was also really impressive - the sharp, intense flavors were enhanced by the salty sweetness of the fish that tasted like it had been caught that afternoon.  I could see how someone looking for more refinement in their experience would find it a bit loud and boisterous. But I've rarely been at a restaurant for nearly 4 hours and had the time fly by.

He ended up finishing less than half of the bowl in addition to his Hamachi, and described the chowder as \"the best thing I've ever had.\" The chorizo in it makes a difference, and you're also getting huge chunks of all different sorts of fish so it's very hearty and filling - and not too creamy.

Opened in November 2005, by twin brothers Mike (the chef) and Tim (the house manager) Selvera, Bar Crudo has taken the raw-bar food craze to a new level. Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane. As the evening was rather chilly on my first visit, I tried the marvelously rich seafood chowder with lots of fresh clams, fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, red potatoes, and smoky applewood smoked bacon ($10). Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster. The crudo (raw fish) is the main focus of the menu and includes gloriously spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha, and green onions ($12); Rhode Island black bass with hard quail egg, habanero tobiko and blood orange reduction ($9); and not-to-be-missed arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill ($10). In case you don't like seafood, try the artisan cheese plate with flower honey, seasonal fruit, medjool dates, and nutty walnut bread ($11) and the sherry duck liver mousse with green pepper corns, cornichons and grilled bread. Their rich flavors and tempting texture blend nicely together.  And if you're indecisive about what to have for dessert, don't worry. There's only one item available on the menu, decadent XOX truffles ($6) that were definitely worth the wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to dine alone, or perhaps with your friends or someone special, Bar Crudo's delicious seafood and quaint atmosphere are definitely a winning combination.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["It's great to sit at the raw bar and fight the urge to drool at the sight of all the laid-out shellfish, but this place is also great for wine & cheese- check out the artisan cheese plate!

I said we had a concert to catch and how long would the branzino take? 7 to 10 minutes. Wow, that's it? Yeah we're getting it. It looks delicious.\n\nI decide to time it. Normally I wouldn't be so anal, but I asked about the time specifically because we were in this time crunch, and the only reason I ordered this was because he *assured* us it would take 7-10 minutes. I ordered the branzino at 8:26pm. 8:36pm passes. No branzino. 8:45pm passes. A branzino comes out from the kitchen!.... and goes to the table next to us. I ask our server if our chowder is still on its way out (we had ordered this at the start of the meal. More than an hour ago). Yes, he said, it's coming. You'd think this would prompt the dish to come out. Nope. By this time my stomach is growling I'm so hungry. FINALLY the fish comes out at.. maybe 9pm? We devour it in minutes. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded a dish taking this long, but don't set a completely false expectation!!\n\nHOWEVER, at the end of the night - REDEMPTION! I'm a pretty open book and was visibly upset at how slow the service was. After we paid, our server brought out a free dessert. How totally *sweet* of him! And really, he was perfectly nice all along. Just stretched too thin I'd say. \n\n~~MUST-HAVES~~\nCrudo sampler, Lobster beet salad, Whole branzino\n\n~~RAW~~\n* Crudo Sampler - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-crudo-san-francisco?select=TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q#TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q\n($14 for 1 piece of each)\nAll seafood was fresh, each piece paired with a variety of unique flavors and textures. Scallop - amazing sweet carrot cream. Arctic char - love the kick, the slightly sour pickled taste (and I normally hate pickled things!). Butterfish & Ono also great.\n\n~~COLD~~\n* Uni Avocado Toast - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-crudo-san-francisco?select=TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q#cyHhcDZvN1_NP3cgsNulhQ\n(sudachi, avocado, frisee salad. $12)\nThe bread - a little hard, stale. The uni - not super fresh - I love uni and feel like I've  had better. My friend had never had uni before and really enjoyed this - he doesn't have something to compare against though. But avocado spread was amazing.\n\n* Lobster Beet Salad - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-crudo-san-francisco?select=TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q#orVUSqd7fJhr0lsPG5ES7Q\n(golden and chioggia beets, burrata, pistachios, arugula, banyls vinaigrette. $18)\nThis had tons of lobster and all of it was excellent. All the ingredients worked incredibly well together.\n\n~~HOT~~\n* Seafood Chowder - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-crudo-san-francisco?select=TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q#J91c-kcrETJC_U1P-_0cbg\n(fish, mussels, squid, shrimp, potatoes, applewood smoked bacon. $8 for single bowl)\nFor all the hype.. disappointed. The flavor was on the sour side - maybe that's how chowder can be interpreted, but I like it more savory. There was a lot of good seafood, but the soup's texture seemed a little watery to me. I like it really chunky & thick. Also - could NOT taste the bacon anywhere! And I was so excited about that part.\n\n* Whole Roasted Branzino - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-crudo-san-francisco?select=TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q#hWBrm2YnfSxgg6X7Xgj1WQ\n(purple, green, and yellow cauliflower, tapenade, arugula. $27)\nFan-freaking-tastic. Lightly crisped skin, meat tender and soft. Just get it.

"], "author": "Kaje Y.", "review": "There were 5 of us, with no reservation, at the end of the night. The wait time was about 15-20 minutes. We were allowed to stand on the side behind the bar and order some drinks. There is a fairly large selection of beer that ranges from so-so beers to good beers. I wanted to be adventurous and try two beers I've never tried before. Unfortunately I picked two that were not really to my liking. Oh well.\n\nWe sat down for dinner and contemplated what to order. We were told that the kitchen closes in 30 minutes, so we'd have to order soon. Our waiter was very nice, amicable, and very attentive. Props for this! It was busy and he made sure we were taken care of.\n\nFood:\n++Sashimi (Artic Char, Salmon, Tuna) - We asked for some honest opinions on which ones to order. Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so. Our cuts were fairly fresh, but it definitely wasn't the freshest sashimi I've had. The portions were large and usually come with 4 pieces per order, but they were able to do 5 and prorate the 5th piece proportionally. \n\n++Uni Avocado Toast - These were okay, but definitely not great. It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish. On it's own, the uni was pretty good and paired well with the avocado, but leaves you scratching your head asking what completes this dish? Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own! Other than that, the lighting is dimmed, and its very cozy and intimate. Good for small parties and perhaps dates.\n\nOverall, the service was good, and the food was decent, but I was really hoping for this place to blow my mind. The price is just a bit on the more expensive side for what you get, but overall isn't bad. Everything in this review directs it to a A-Ok rating. Sums it up perfectly.\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend this place, but I'm sure that won't stop you from going.

I felt the avocado and the uni clashed. I am a bit of an uni enthusiast so I guess I may be biased since I enjoy the purity of the taste of uni. \n\nThe chowder though was AMAZING. This may be the best chowder in San Francisco. I could come back just to eat the Chowder and drink the beers. The bacon brought out a really smoky flavor to the chowder and the seafood made a great base for the soup. And all the seafood was perfect for the chowder. Hands down BEST chowder I've had thus far in SF. \n\nThe Idaho Red Trout was also very good. The roasted vegetables went perfectly with the fish. They serve the fish whole from the tail to the head and I thought it was a perfect way of showing their dedication to fresh seafood. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are definitely planning on coming back here for their chowder!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-05-14"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the most amazing seafood chowder with fish, mussels, squid, shrimp, potatoes, applewood smoked bacon, and their Uni Avocado Toast sudachi with frisee salad, a Lobster & tomato dish, along with a very nice (and reasonably-priced) bottle of cabernet.

The butterfish was the highlight, with a little spicy kick which was balanced nicely with the sweet peaches. The arctic char, supposedly the house favorite, was absolutely awful. It was SO salty, coming from an avid salt-lover that means something. Our order was covered in sea salt below a layer of wasabi tobiko.

And, I don't mean to mean to be crude, but the seafood here is EFFING AWESOME.\n\nThe sign for the entrance can be a little tough for this place, but once you find the commanding, large windows in the front of the restaurant, the rest is easy.  For such a posh and modern looking place, service is surprisingly casual and friendly, in a good way.\n\nTo start, I had the Crudo Sampler.  The Crudo Sampler comes with an all-star lineup of Arctic Char, Hokkaido Scallops, Tombo Tuna, and Butterfish.  All the seafood tasted really fresh with unexpected, yet clean flavor combinations.\n\nThe Hokkaido Scallop was interesting with the roasted apple and celery root puree and truffle salt.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it still tasted great.  The Tombo Tuna was also a little bit on the sweet side, but the sweetness of the hazelnut and pear was balanced with a nice tartness from the pomegranate reduction.  The Butterfish was one of my favorites, topped with olive, black garlic, shiso, and an orange vinaigrette.  I don't think I would have thought any of these ingredients would go together, but somehow, they did.  The fish itself was out of this world, and only tasted better with a great mix of sweetness and acidity.\n\nThe star of the sampler, however, was the Arctic Char.  The freshness of the actual char harmonizes perfectly with the spiciness of the horseradish cream and wasabi tobiko eggs.  Top that all with a bit of dill, and you got yourself a real winner.  Overall, the sampler is the best way to get a good idea of Bar Crudo's food.\n\nI also got a Beef Tartare topped four ways.  Each was topped with either an egg yolk, hot pepper, horseradish cream, or a sardine.  All were great, and the beef was really clean and fresh, but were a little less interesting than some of the other dishes.\n\nFinally, I got the Uni Avocado Toast.  I love uni, I love avocado, and I love toast.  So I thought this would be a great combination.  And it was.  It was a little heavy on the fattiness, but a little fat never hurt anyone.  There was also a side sudachi, frisee, and herb salad.  If you have the salad on top of the uni and avocado on the toast, there's a great combination of flavors and textures.\n\nOverall, the seafood here is innovative, updated, and crude.\n\nGET:  Arctic Char", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-12-25"}, {"excerpts": ["The Crudo sampler is a must as well as the Uni Avocado Toast, but everything we have had has been excellent & there's always a good reasonably priced bottle of wine to be had as well as a decent beer selection. \n\n"], "author": "Jenn W.", "review": "Our favorite neighborhood restaurant - well, except for Little Star but the two aren't really comparable. \n\nThe Crudo are amazing.

The inconsistency in the flavor really bothered me. \n\n2. The seafood chowder was lukewarm when served. It was not very creamy or flavorful. It almost tasted like they used canned chowder that they didn't heat up throughly. They might not have done that but it surely tasted like they didn't put a lot of effort into the dish. The ingredients, especially the chicken, tasted mushy and bland. Oh well, as least the portion was small...\n\n3.

Simple, not too greasy like other shishito peppers I've had, and topped with a few tender anchovies (boquerones).\n\n* KONA KAMPACHI CRUDO ($14 for 4) - 5/5\n[orange, fennel pollen, orange oil] \nSo buttery soft, the kampachi basically just melts in your mouth. I loved the light citrusy sweetness from the orange. I don't think this crudo comes with the Crudo Sampler, but I'd easily get 4 of these instead of the sampler with 1 each of the other crudos, even though I'm normally one to like trying a little of more things.\n\n* TOMBO TUNA CRUDO ($14 for 4) - 4/5\n[citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko] \nGood but not as impressive as the kampachi. The tuna wasn't as smooth, but I liked the flavors - a little acidity with a good kick from the chili.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-10-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Since there wasn't any seating yet, we used one of their small shelves hanging from the wall as a table top.

Ask for a side of horseradish. They'll hand you a ramekin of grated dry horseradish which pairs well with your oysters. We also had the seafood chowder. SO GOOD! It had chunks of fish, mussels, squid and shrimp. The chowder was very creamy and flavorful. Make sure you ask for bread so you could dip it into your soup.\n\nThe uni toast was okay. The uni could've paired well with other accompaniments. They used sourdough for the toast topped with avocado. Whatever sauce they used, it was too sour and overpowered the buttery taste of the uni. The upside was that the uni pieces were big and fresh.\n\nNow onto the crudo. We tried every crudo on the menu. \nScallops with soubise, pickled corn, chili and chive blossom - Good, but the toppings kept falling off when picking up the scallops.\nKampachi with salmorejo, castelvetrano olives and orange oil - My least favorite. I'm a huge fan of kampachi, but the accompaniments didn't enhance the flavor of the fish. If anything, I'd switch out the olives and the rock salt.\nTombo Tuna with citrus, fennel, picked peppers and black tobiko - Refreshing combo.

He told us to wait near the bar so the host can seat us. After we sat, Drew came back and ask us how was our day. Friendly, personal, and a great way to start our anniversary dinner. He also told us that we still apply to the happy hour special since we are early.  \n\nDrinks - Lambrusco sparkling red wine by the glass.\n\nWife wanted some sweet dessert wine (not for paring the seafood), but more for a good night out. With the recommendation, it wasn't bad.  I opt for just your normal water by the glass.\n\nOur first arrival - 1/2 Dozen Miyagi oysters from Tomales Bay, 4 Kumamoto from Washington. \n\nThe Special on this selection was the $1 Miyagi Oyster from Tomales Bay. We thought to give it a try. Along with the happy hour special, my wife loves Kumamoto and we proceed in ordering them on the main menu. The Oyster came on a chilled filled iced, and 6 Oysters on the left and the other half on the right. The middle center were two small dip sauce with a slice of lemon to wake th Oyster up.  \n\nWe must say, the Miyagi Oyster is by far tasty than the Kumamoto.

Your typical Prawn steam an chilled, then served on ice with dipping sauce with lemon at the center.\n\u00a0\nThird arrival - Crudo for Two: \nArctic char - horseradish creme fraiche, Wasabi tobiko, dill.  Scallop - corn puree, radish, chive.  Butterfish - pickled fennel, espellete pepper, Basile.  Tombo tuna - citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko\n\nWow. What a fresh taste! The the butterfish with a little hint of spice from the espellete pepper made your tongue sensor go wild and then calm with the mixture of Basile and fennel into the mix. The citrus and chili in the Tambo tuna lighten the mouth with fruit texture and a clean popping wash of the yuzu tobiko on each bite. The Arctic char had the smokey taste but a small clear of the noise of the Wasabi tobiko. And finally, the scallop is so fresh that it melt in your mouth on each bite. No need to chew like a gum, it just melt!   \n\u00a0\nForth arrival - Lobster and Tomato Salad: Burrata, little gems, corn, banyuls vinaigrette.\n\nThis dish is refreshing and light. It had all the right mixture but wished it had a little more lobster. But overall, a nice light dish to pack into the balance meal with greens/veggies.\n\u00a0\nFifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\nWe shared a large Chowder bowl and it was under the happy hour pricing. Can't beat that! The wifey said she could have passed on this dish, but I enjoyed it. It is different from other Chowder bowls we've tried, but it is just a little salty. If you didn't get bread on the side, it is a must to balance off the saltiness that comes from the Bacon, Cream, and Butter? \n\nSixth arrival - Roasted Crab: scallions, aleppo pepper, chili, verjus, tarrgon.\n\nWe wanted to give the crab a try as some reviewer mention it is a taste to try. Since we are here for seafood, why not! The Aleppo pepper and chili sure pack some heat to this dish. I like it but it is really messy. We were advise to be dirty when chowing down on this dish and we continued to say, bring it on. The crab isnt big and with each bite brought a good heat to the mouth and the tomato base tried to smooth out the heat. Overall, we will pass on this dish.\n\u00a0\nSeventh arrival - Crude for Two.\nWhat can we say, we wanted round #2 and nothing will explain more than Yum!\n\u00a0\nFinal arrival - Truffles on the house. \nWhat a surprise and Drew gave us House made Truffles for our Happy Anniversary dinner.

It is creamy and full of bacon flavor but I was ultimately a little disappointed because it lacked a robust seafood flavor. Now I love bacon, but why call it a seafood chowder if seafood isn't going to be prominently featured?

YUM!!!\n\nI made an online dinner reservation for a weekday which was super easy. I got to the restaurant early to try out their happy hour and luckily my friend was able to make to the restaurant before the happy hour ended so we both got to take advantage of the good deals.\n\nWe shared the following off the happy hour menu:\n2 dz oysters, 1/2 dz mussels, a cup of seafood chowder and rock cod tacos\n\nThe best were of course the oysters. The mussels were drenched in butter which is normally a good thing but I thought it was just ok. The seafood chowder was good. It had a lot of good chunks of seafood in it. It was a bit on the heavier side so its definitely nice to have a lot of bread to soak this up. The rock cod were tasty. I appreciated the fish to be grilled and not battered. These were kind of expensive though and it was $10 on the happy hour menu for 2 tacos.\n\nWe also shared some items from there regular dinner menu:\nuni-avocado toast and crudo sampler for 2 which consisted of artic char, butterfish, tombo tuna and scallops.\n\nThe uni avocado toast was a bit underwhelming. I was expecting a whole piece of toast but we had two small pcs of toasted bread with the avocado smear with uni. All the flavors were very distinct. The uni was pretty fresh but the avocado tasted more like guacamole. It was tasty but I wouldn't order this again. The sampler was a great way to try all their fresh fish bites. All of the bites were ok, the tastiest crudo has to be the scallops. Soo fresh and it had bits of fresh corn on it. Yum!\n\nAll in all, it's a great spot if you are craving seafood.

It's not cheap, but seafood anywhere (and good quality seafood at that), is not inexpensive - so just be warned. I do want to come here for happy hour (5-6:30 pm) some time for $1 oysters. I may be stating the obvious, but if you're a vegetarian, you're going to have a really tough time eating here.\n\nAmbiance-wise, it's nice, with a lot of natural sunlight in the front and high ceilings. It can get loud, so you may not be able to hear other people in your group super well.\n\nCrudo Sampler (4 pieces, $14, 8 pieces, $28)- I got the sampler for 2, which came with 8 pieces, and shared with the person I was dining with. Or if you have a favorite, you can get 4 pieces of just that one fish for $14, but I really liked the variety. The cuts of fish were thick, the fish was fresh, and each piece had a little bit of garnish to make it a little extra special and unique (a hint of wasabi, a piece of kumquat). The garnish or sauces didn't overpower the taste of the fish, which I appreciated.\n\nUni Avocado Toast ($14) - It was interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but it's expensive (yes, I know it's uni), for what you get. The size of the \"toast\" was like those mini toasts you get in a box from Trader Joe's, and about 2 inches long. It was topped with avocado and uni and dressed with too much lime, which was just overpowering. I'll stick to uni at Japanese restaurants, and stick to avocado on a thick slab of toast at places like Jane or Reveille Coffee. Came with a small salad (or maybe it was decoration) that was overly limey, but I ate it anyways because I was wondering where the rest of the dish was, and I was hungry.\n\nBranzino ($28) - The fish was nice and well-cooked and seasoned, but you'll be picking around little bones all night. Just be warned. Compared to getting 8 pieces of sashimi for $28 and getting an entire filet of fish, this is probably a better deal and will keep you relatively full.\n\nAll in all, it was a pricey meal - for 2 people, with the crudo sampler, 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine and branzino, it was $114 before tip & tax. I left feeling satisfied and not overly full, which was nice, but I think you can probably get a better meal for $60-70 per person elsewhere in the city.

The wait time was about 15-20 minutes. We were allowed to stand on the side behind the bar and order some drinks. There is a fairly large selection of beer that ranges from so-so beers to good beers. I wanted to be adventurous and try two beers I've never tried before. Unfortunately I picked two that were not really to my liking. Oh well.\n\nWe sat down for dinner and contemplated what to order. We were told that the kitchen closes in 30 minutes, so we'd have to order soon. Our waiter was very nice, amicable, and very attentive. Props for this! It was busy and he made sure we were taken care of.\n\nFood:\n++Sashimi (Artic Char, Salmon, Tuna) - We asked for some honest opinions on which ones to order. Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so. Our cuts were fairly fresh, but it definitely wasn't the freshest sashimi I've had. The portions were large and usually come with 4 pieces per order, but they were able to do 5 and prorate the 5th piece proportionally. \n\n++Uni Avocado Toast - These were okay, but definitely not great. It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish. On it's own, the uni was pretty good and paired well with the avocado, but leaves you scratching your head asking what completes this dish? Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own! Other than that, the lighting is dimmed, and its very cozy and intimate. Good for small parties and perhaps dates.\n\nOverall, the service was good, and the food was decent, but I was really hoping for this place to blow my mind. The price is just a bit on the more expensive side for what you get, but overall isn't bad. Everything in this review directs it to a A-Ok rating.

I'm enchanted by my glass of wine and loving hearing about where it's from. \n\nNext up, the Lobster Beet salad, with gold and chiogga beets, burrata, mache, pistachios, banyuls vinaigrette. Very Beautiful and light. So delicious. \n\nThen to finish, the Seafood Chowder, which was perfection in itself.

The hostess accommodated us and kindly guided us to our table - poured us cucumber infused water (yum!) and handed us the menu (HH and regular). \n\nSince we already knew what we wanted, we went ahead and ordered a few minutes later. The food came our relatively quickly (since most of it is raw) and the service was amazing! One lady kept coming over to our table to ask if everything was going alright and kept giving us bread for our sauces and soup. She was very nice and made the experience more delightful.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Miyagi Oysters $1 each\nMy bf loved his oysters (I didn't have any since I'm not a fan). He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it! Though don't get overboard cause it could get a bit salty. My bf commented that if a hot link were to be liquified, it would taste like this (the sauce). \n\n4. Crudo Sampler $13 (not on HH menu)\nCame with 4 different items: artic char, scallop, ono, and butterfish. My favorites were the artic char and the scallop. Though I didn't think it was spectacular (I think I had too high of an expectation from all the great reviews). Don't get me wrong, the fish were really fresh and the complex flavors were executed well, but I don't think I would crave for it... The ono and butterfish were too fatty and soft in texture for me. \n\n5. Seafood Chowder $5 \nNot your ordinary chowder. Not super thick, creamy, nor filling like clam chowder. It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal.

The yellowtail was the best of the four.

We had driven quite a long way to spend the day in the city and decided to come here for happy hour. We came here just before 5pm (HH is 5-6:30pm) so we were the first to arrive and they let us sit down while they were still setting up the restaurant. Shortly after though, crowds came in and the restaurant was almost filled by 6pm. \n\nWe ordered a dozen oysters of the daily special (Miyagi Marin), bowl of the seafood clam chowder, manila clams, and 2 for $10 fried cod fish tacos. The oysters were super small and didn't give too much flavor, or maybe it was because the sauce at the middle wasn't up to my usual standards. But I didn't think that the oysters were extraordinary. The seafood clam chowder did not taste like a clam chowder at all. It was super cheesy and a weird orange color. Don't get me wrong, the seafood was amazing.. it was so light and easily pulled apart. But when you put chowder in the description, I am sorry but I automatically think of some potatoes, chunky white creamy sauce with some clams  and vegetables. This is nowhere near what Bar Crudo's seafood chowder tasted like. On top of that, my friend found that $5 for a taco that you can easily find for $2 anywhere in SF wasn't so great. I understand that the piece of fish was cooked perfectly and all, but the ingredients did not leave me thinking 5 stars. However, a brighter note is the selection of beers. We had ordered the Allagash which is something different from our usual and it was really good. I usually hate beer, but it was a really nice light flavor. \n\nA funny fact was that their daily special happy hour beer was Sudwerk's Pilsner beer for $3 and usually us, UC Davis students get that shitty beer on $1 pint nights on Wednesdays.

My friend and I arrived and asked if we could be seated and order a couple of appetizers to take advantage of happy hour (5:00-6:30pm) and since our third person would be arriving later.  The hostess said that wouldn't be a problem and had us wait on the side.  She oddly walked towards the back of the restaurant as if she was looking for a table.  There was tons of seating available throughout the restaurant.  She came back a couple minutes later, pushed two small tables together, and seated us.  Even though we mentioned we would like to order a couple appetizers first, we sat there for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged.\n\nAs our meal went on, the service only deteriorated.   Our wannabe hipster waiter rarely checked on us throughout our meal and had a rather stuck up attitude when he did.  The topping to his rude attitude?  We finished all our dishes except the bone marrow that never came and I flagged him down to ask him to cancel the dish because it's been 30+ minutes.  He said the bone marrow was being plated but he could \"take one of the bone marrows off our bill if it made us feel any better\" (we ordered two orders).  I don't need your attitude and your failure to apologize pissed me off even more.  We waited another 10 minutes before the bone marrow came out.  If it was being plated, WHY was it not out almost immediately?!  \n\nAfter we finished the dish, we asked for the bill which was given to us almost immediately.  The hostess tried to give us the stare down while eyeing how much I was leaving for tip.  YES I SKIMPED ON THE TIP BECAUSE TIPPING IS EARNED AND SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTED!  Upon leaving, no one acknowledged us by thanking us for coming in or even a goodbye.\n\nI do hope management reads this because they obviously chosen to hire a sour bunch.

My half of crab was tiny and lacked any kind of sweet taste.\n*Lobster Beet Salad ($18) - Good and probably the best thing I had all night.  Generous portions of lobster meat were mixed with largely cut pieces of beets and tarragon that had a slight bitterness to it.\n*Littleneck Clams ($1.50 each) - Would've been better if there wasn't that tad of a fishy taste to them.\n*Bone Marrow (2 pieces, $14) - A let down.  I should've known better than to order bone marrow from a place known for seafood.  The marrow lacked seasoning as well as the usual savory taste I expect.\n*Manila Clams ($5 happy hour price) - Okay.

The sweetness of the fresh, but slightly small, Hokkaido scallops is the perfect foil to the celery root, roasted apple puree, and truffle salt garnishes.  The tombo tuna with pear, hazelnut, and pomegranate reduction was absolutely delicious.  While interesting, the olive, orange vinaigrette, black garlic, and shiso detract from the pure ecstasy that butterfish can be if left unadulterated.  A combination of tuna confit, asparagus, roasted red peppers, arbequina olives, fried caper berries, and manchego cheese, served on tomato bread, the San Sebastian is a stand-out in the \"Cold\" section of the menu, while the seared Hokkaido scallop served with spicy coconut curry, shrimp, and peppers on pea greens is the king of the \"Hot\" section.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and fairly priced.  With a reasonably large number of by-the-glass and by-the-bottle selections, it avoids the \"usual suspects\" in favor of lesser known, but menu-appropriate, choices from Germany, Italy, and France.  A highlight is the beer menu--a virtual tome, consisting of more than 50 selections from the light and refreshing Reality Czeck to The Abyss, an imperial stout.\n\nService is attentive, informed, and helpful.  Water glasses were not left empty, and servers provided excellent food and beverage recommendations--staff training is obviously a priority at Bar Crudo.\n\nWhile some of the food is raw, the cooking and service at Bar Crudo are not.  This place is the real deal:  reasonable (for The City) prices, good service, and great food in a trendy, up-and-coming neighborhood.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I remember the portions were small, but totally satisfying.

Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

Anyway, I will try impartially rate the food as I was eating it.\n\nSampler (arctic char, kona kampachi, butterfish, scallop) - Can't decide what appetizer to get?  This is perfect because all the fish is fresh and prepared in a way that's easy on the palette.  The green tobiko on the arctic char is exquisite!!

Each of the four meat shapes are topped with differently with horseradish creme fraiche, pepper, quail egg, and spanish anchovy.  The first couple bites is good but if you're only sharing this with one other person, then this gets quite overbearing.\n\nUni and Avocado Toast - $10!  The dish comes with two huge pieces of crostini topped with two huge slices of uni EACH.  If you've had uni at a Japanese restaurant, then you know that this is a spankin' deal.\n\nSeafood Chowder - I actually think this was put me over the top.  Staring into the toilet bowl of barf, it resembled this dish.  I know... TMI!  Even though people rave about this soup, I thought it was mediocre in flavor.  They make sure to include at least one piece of seafood: squid, oyster (well I got 3 of this), shrimp, fish mussels and then oysters and bacon too.

How good is that?  :)\n\nRAW OYSTERS ($1/each) (4/5):  Imported from Washington, Bar Crudo's oysters are served raw and in a half shell with two slices of lemon and a side of cocktail sauce and lime sauce.  It was delicious.  I think we each easily ate eight oysters each.  We probably could have ordered 100 oysters and then some.  :P  If you're not able to get to the fresh Tomales Bay and Hog Island oysters, Bar Crudo's medium-sized oysters are the next best thing.  :)  The oysters were mildly sweet, fresh and tasty.  Thanks, Rita C., for finding such a great place!\n\nMUSSELS with JALAPENO ($1/each) (3/5):  The mussels were good, but not what I had expected.  They aren't served from the shell, but are taken out and piled onto a little saucer with jalapenos and peppers placed on top.  I didn't really get the jalapeno flavor, but it was nice to try. Next time, I'd probably pass on the mussels and concentrate on the oysters. \n\nVENUE:  For a party of 10, we sat upstairs overlooking the downstairs dining area and kitchen.  It was great seating, and it was nice being away from the crowded downstairs area.  The restaurant is narrow in the sense that it's an small, elongated restaurant that seats maybe about 50 people. The place had a romantic, chic feel to it.\n\nCLAM CHOWDER:  The best clam chowder I've had is from Boston.  The next best is from Hog Island in the Ferry Building.  The clam chowder here looks like it could be just as good as the one from Hog Island!

The restaurant is pretty small and had dim lightings but luckily we got window seats so the light shone in from the outside.\n\nWe were served water with cucumber in it, which was interesting because it made the water taste more fresh and less tap!\n\nWe tried all the different kinds of OYSTERS they had.  When the waitress brought out our platter of oysters,she quickly went through which oyster was which, but it just went in one ear and out the other.  I wished there was a toothpick indicating which were which.  Anyways, the oysters tasted very fresh and was the perfect starter for our meal.\n\nThen came the CRUDO SAMPLER, which were beautifully presented and consisted of a variety of 4 different types of raw fishes...\n\nARCTIC CHAR: my two friends thought this was the second best, but it was my least favorite because I don't like horseradish nor do I like wasabi flavor. If you like your salmon with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tobiko, then you would LOVE this.\n\nHOKKAIDO SCALLOPS: it was my second favorite, while this was the other two's favorites.  We loved the texture of the scallop when you bite into it and the flavors of the pea puree along with the citrus flavor of the lime went perfect with the scallop. \n\nKONA KAMPACHI: one of my friends and I rated this as third best, while this was the least favorite for the other friend. It wasn't too bad, the fish was really fresh and I probably could have done without the citrusy flavor of the peaches and the chili lime vinaigrette.  The sprouts on top, didn't seem to help with the flavor either, could have done without that garnish.\n\nBUTTERFISH: my favorite, one of my friends' third favorite and the other's least favorite.  I just loved the combination of the butterfish with the serrano ham and the salmorejo sauce.  It was the PERFECT combination along with a quail egg. This just did it for me.  I loved the flavor and it left me wanting MORE!!\n\nNext we had the STEAK CRUDO, which was beautifully presented.  At first I was hesistant to try it, I mean I've had raw beef before at a vietnamese restaurant, but i've never had raw chunks of beef.  It made me think of cat food.  But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  It went well with their bread.  It was very nicely flavored and spiced.\n\nLOBSTER HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD: absolutely to die for!!! IT WAS THE BEST DISH WE GOT!! We all LOVED it. If you come here, you MUST order this.  Their heirloom tomatos were fresh, sweet and juicy.  The fresh mozzerella melted in my mouth.  The lobster, plump, juicy, fresh, sweet and DELICIOUS.  The vinaigrette dressing went well with everything and the greens were nice fresh and crisp.  EVERYTHING just went well together!\n\nAfter everything came out...we wanted MORE...so we ordered...\n\nMONKFISH LIVER MOUSSE: sounds disgusting, but it wasn't too bad.  It had a very unique taste to it and after awhile it became pretty addicting.  Went very well with the bread. \n\nTUNA CONFIT: Another winner in my books.  I loved the tenderness of the tuna and the mix of asparagus and fresh bell peppers it was made with.  Olives complimented well with the rest of the dish and the TOMATO bread was DELICIOUS!!! Also loved the egg, which was cooked to perfection (not too cooked, not too raw...it had a perfect yellow yolk). I could have done without the cheese though.\n\nOCTOPUS SALAD: Just didn't deliver for me.  I didn't like the taste of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I was expecting a more citrus flavor to it.\n\nThey served all the raw seafood first, then they served the cooked food.\n\nLastly we had the MANILA CLAMS: it wasn't all that great.  I actually thought the broth was a little bit on the salty side, but it tasted better when you dipped bread into it. Nothing too special for me.\n\nI was very impressed with their service, the presentation as well as the taste of the food.

The worst that can happen is you'll be out $6.\n\n$1 Mussels - I've never had cold mussels but these were delicious with herbs and garlic.

Delicious and good amount of fresh! fish vs. potato filler.\n\n$5 Clams - Marinated in white wine broth...possibly my 2nd favorite next to the oysters.\n\n$10 Fish tacos (2) - Crazy good value for 2 lightly battered fresh cod and the works...1st time around these were a bit larger but still good on corn tortillas. \n\n$5 wine + beer - both went down way too easy.\n\nOff the happy hour menu\n\nCrudo platter - a must.

Although this isn't a terribly new concept, in my opinion, it is in its infancy as far as exposure on the United States culinary scene.  Have you ever noticed the way ingredients have their 15 minutes?  Napa restaurants are notorious for this.  Star chefs will do a menu featuring a particular ingredient or preparation; examples that come to mind: skatewing, foie gras corndogs, sunchokes, kanapachi, wagyu, foam, raw, you get the idea.  Soon everyone is doing it until it is overexposed like certain young Hollywood stars.  Bar Crudo is a trendsetter; watch for many to follow in their very capable footsteps.

However, if you blend in the atmosphere, great service, fairly easy parking for a small SF restaurant, and fresh raw dishes they provide I'll still give them a 4 star.

(That's a little abrupt, I know, but it's descriptive and true.)\n\nThe crudo remain inventive:  I tried all five, liked all five.  The Atlantic char with horseradish is (of course) fantastic, but so were the rest:  butterfish, scallop, tombo tuna, the special scallop with a cold curry sauce.  Incroyable.   There are always five or six (or three) (who knows) distinct flavors going on at the same time.  I love that they are distinct.  (In a way, a Vietnamese sandwich is the same: cilantro and jalapenos and warmth and cold.)\n\nAlso had the beet salad with lobster and my favorite Gioia burrata (available at Cowgirl Creamery).   Very fresh, good, but it didn't quite sing.  It needed something else to tie it together subtlely.... a touch of grapefruit salt?  Balsamic reduction?  A couple of flakes of red pepper?   The crudo has so much, and this was almost right but a little . . . bland.  Still, uber fresh.  \n\nWe finished off with the scallop and curry hot dish and split a seafood chowder.  Crazy good.  The wines go really well with the food:  there's a lovely Crozes-Hermitage Marsanne-Rousanne that is austere enough to go with fish yet rich enough to satisfy.  The Albarino also works really well.  \n\nI will say that the slo-o-ow food concept remains untouched:  we weren't exactly slamming the wine on a school night, and yet we finished that Crozes-Hermitage before the final courses.   Then again, I like a leisurely dinner, and a split glass of Albarino did the trick and brought us home, stuffed to the absolute brims.\n\nAlso, lovely service, and I like the new spot.  Again, I don't know how they deliver such amazingly fresh fish, time in and time out, in such a small place. They must work hard to solidify their relationships with vendors.\n\nP.S.  While they have a uni toast, boy, I miss the old uni presentation.  At the old place, the owner dove once a week (Wed? Th?) for uni, served it spiked on the shell, and it tasted, as I think I said in review 1, like the sea.  I don't even like uni.  (Well, I guess I do now.)\n\nP.P.S.  I miss the Tunnel Top!

This chowder was infused with chunks of smoky, salty, porky bacon.  It was also filled with fish, clams, calamari, muscles, shrimp, and potato.

Last Friday a few girlfriends and I rushed over for the $1 oyster happy hour intending to stay through to dinner. We started off with 2 dozen oysters.

The food was completely on point.  \n\nWe started with a couple of oyster samplers, which was really fun.  Usually when I get a plate of oysters, I can't tell much of a difference, but this was totally different.  Most of our table enjoyed the Kusshi's the most because they were so silky smooth.  \n\nThen, we ordered a bunch of the raw dishes.  We got the Kona Kampachi, which was my personal favorite.  I loved the pairing with peaches, and the avocado mousse went nicely with everything to tie it together.  We also got the butterfish, scallops, and the fluke.  All of the flavors were totally different, which made everything seem like a great tasting menu. \n\nWe got the lobster tomato salad with burrata, which was so delicious.  To be fair though, I love anything with burrata.  We also got the whole dungeness crab.  Here's where I think the service could have been a little bit better.  First of all, we got crab crackers to help us get the meat out, but it would have been really great if we also got a crab pick/scoop.  Using our regular fork was a little too unwieldy.  Plus, the busboy took away the butter before the whole table was done eating, so we requested more, but it took a little bit of time.  Also, at the end of the crab, it would have been really nice to get some wipes or a finger bowl to clean our hands.  I mean, c'mon, we just ate a whole crab with our hands.  We did end up getting bread, but only after we asked for it after seeing it on other tables.  \n\nFinally, we got to the hot portion of the meal:  devil prawns, scallops in coconut curry sauce, and the seafood chowder.  Due to the bacon flavor and overall depth of the chowder sauce, I believe I told the table if I spilled some of the broth on my arm, I would most likely go Donner party on myself. \n\nOverall, since we were eating some great quality seafood, and our table went a little crazy with the booze, I knew the bill would be on the more expensive side.  I have to say I felt like this restaurant totally deserved it though, because the food we had really was quite commendable.  I am not the type of person who eats a ton of fish outside of sushi, and the variety and interesting mix of flavors on this menu were able to keep me totally engaged throughout.  \n\nMy one last comment on this place though was they didn't have anything to offer for dessert, which was disappointing.

Sure, I have tried oysters (not really my thing- but how can you blame me, being from the Midwest?), and those are presented not really in a Latin or Japanese fashion- but for the most part- raw fish was always something that I would have only at those two types of places.\n\nNow- I simply have to think back to that cold August evening when I went with my fiance (now wife) to try this place out to remember how limited my food experiences have been.  It was eyeopening, and almost maddening for me to realize that such wonderfully creative presentations can be done- but only with the finest and freshest fish and shell fish around.  It was a wonderful, and yet frustrating experience- realizing that living in Chicago limits me to this type of food that I really love and now consider to be one of the best ways of presenting raw seafood.\n\nCrudo being the Italian word for raw, we somewhat expected things to be presented with that type of background.  I guess one could interpret it that way a bit- but only in the sense that truly great Italian cooks will only use things that are fresh, accessibly local, and in season- and Bar Crudo does this.  The chefs allowing the ingredients to sing for themselves, without manipulating the flavors through various cooking methods is a terrific way of experiencing the freshness and liveliness of such high quality ingredients.\n\nTo top off the crudo experience (in which we shared quite a few oysters as well ad the Crudo Sampler), we had ordered one of their hot dishes- in which we got grilled jaw/cheek of something (tuna maybe) and this too was wonderfully flavored, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience.

I was a little buzzed and checking out everybody's food, so I didn't mind too much.

That being said, we also weren't in the mood to drop $200 on dinner that night. We agreed to try some of the crudos, the lobster and burrata salad (b/c I can rarely resist creamy fresh burrata), and a then finish with a seafood chowder, both for something warm and to fill any lingering appetites. \n\nWe tried the ono, tombo tuna, and yellowtail crudos. The entire table was alarmed by the overpowering pineapple vanilla vinaigrette that topped the tombo tuna.  Pristine fresh fish should not be drowned out by such strong flavors. When the manfriend tasted it first and remarked, \"This tastes like Lifesavers,\" I thought he was more buzzed than I had realized. Upon trying the tombo tuna myself, I could not believe the uncanny resemblance to pineapple lifesavers!\n\nThe crudos were all stunning to look at; each plated with tiny microgreens, light sprinklings of exotic ingredients, and bright splashes of sauces for color. Except for the pineapple misstep, the others were very much enjoyed. The lobster salad was also a posh treat. The grad student salary does not allow for frequent lobster consumption these days. It was even more enjoyable to have plump juicy chunks of lobster primed for my consumption without having to decorticate it myself. \n\nThe seafood chowder was everything I hoped for and very richly garnered all the prior praise from others' reviews. So velvety and so, so very delicious. I foresee myself sneaking away for a glass of cava, a dozen oysters, and an indulgent bowl this of chowder when I need a special treat. \n\nService was perhaps more casual than the artistry on the plates and prices dictated.

This quality of freshness is prevalent with every dish at Bar Crudo!  The tiny pats of scallops were so rich and decadent... like butter but w/o the guilt of the calories.  I would easily enjoy 2x the portion here.\n\n* Rhode Island Fluke - Loved the sweet beets against the salty cavier.  Gave the somewhat bland fish some life.  Rather disappointed the horseradish did not have a stronger kick to it.  \n\n* Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Cubes - Like a high class Hawaiian Poke!  I would have enjoyed a bit more spice, but I can see it taking away from the high quality, deep red tuna.  Green onions added a wonderful compliment.\n\n* Tombo Tuna - Quite refreshing!  This part of the review will be lacking as it wasn't a very memorable sample.\n\nWe went surf 'n turf here and also got the Steak Crudo, a series of semi-raw steak topped with various tastes.  The poached egg should be popped so the meat could marinate in the yolk.  This is a classic tartare or steak and eggs froofy younger brother.  I loved the simplicity of the pipparas and beef... spicy sweet with fatty beef.  These tastes are made for each other.  All this served with toasted crutons to cut the richness.  And you know the bits of peppercress aren't just good garnish, they should be eaten with the beef and fish.  Think of it as a tiny salad.  \n\nA thoroughly great experience here.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you plan on coming here, but if you do have to wait then the Tunnel Top bar is right next door to make passing the time a bit easier.  The cozy sized room upstairs makes for a very romantic atmosphere while the downstairs bar area is a bit more upbeat.  Portions here are small, and the dishes are a bit pricey so be prepared to spend quite a bit of money to get full here.  \n\nI came here for an anniversary dinner the other night and had a lovely meal.  We started trying 2 of each oyster that was available and they were all types I had never tried before. The standout ones were the Olympia oysters from Washington and like the restaurant, packed a punch for their small size. We also ordered prawns which were cooked perfectly and delish.  The oysters were probably the best part of the meal, but mainly because I absolutely adore oysters and can eat several dozen in one sitting! \n\nWe ordered the crudo sampler which was great because it gave us a little bit of variety.  I really enjoyed the arctic char and the butterfish.  The monkfish liver mousse was very delicious as well.  The bread they served with it was grilled and added a great texture to compliment the fluffiness of the mousse.  Then we had the San Sebastian which was probably the largest portion out of all the dishes we ordered.  We ordered a few of the strong Belgian ales and felt quite tipsy by the end of the meal!  We didn't get a chance to try the clam chowder but it looks amazing and it will give us a reason to come back and try something new.

Determined to try all restaurants that have made the cut, I've been to 31 so far.  But, the experience has not felt complete... something is missing.  My mid-year resolution: add a final Yelp step to the process.  Bar Crudo is my first.\n\nI was solo tonight, and lucky me there was a single seat at the bar which was not reserved.  I love sitting at an oyster or sushi bar, right in the middle of the action, and I like it even more if the people behind the bar serve booze.  As I people-watched, I noticed that I seemed to be the only person without a reservation, which was a surprise to me considering it was a Monday night at 6 pm.  I bet this place gets crudo crazy later in the week.\n\nThe wine list was fairly unimpressive, although the beer selection was crudonculous.  I opted for the only Pinot (Noir in this review and all others) on the menu, which came in a bottle that had a cap instead of a cork.  I'll never get used to that; I don't care how \"green\" it is.\n\nI decided to start with the Crudo sampler appetizer.  I'm pretty sure that I was the first person who put an order in for the evening, however, the wait time was way too long.  Maybe not that long in crudo minutes, but certainly long in normal appetizer minutes.  It's ok though, because while I am waiting, I get to witness the spectrum of skill level in oyster shucking.  First guy, coulda done it blindfolded.  Second guy, I coulda used a blindfold, as I was certain this guy would slice his finger off before the dozenth oyster was open.\n\nI understood the wait time when the sampler arrived.  There were four kinds of crudo, each more delicate and intricate than the previous.  The one I was really excited about trying was the Hawaiian Ono, which had lemongrass, citrus, mint, chili, tobiko, and more on it.  I LOVE all of those things.  Did I love all those things together?  Not so much.  I expected some sort of crazy crudo chemical reaction in my mouth, which didn't happen.  Instead, it just tasted like a bunch of random ingredients thrown together for an experiment.  Very disappointing.  Thank goodness for the second crudo - the arctic char, which had just a few logical ingredients and was heaven.  In my industry, I'd recommend the KISS technique to the Crudoians.... Keep It Simple, Stupid; sometimes less is more.\n\nIt was cold outside, and there were only a couple of hot dishes on the menu.  I opted for a small seafood chowder, which was surprisingly large.  The first bite was beautiful, and I decided Bauer was onto something.  After the third bite, however, I was certain that I could replicate the chowder at home with a pint of cream and a few sticks of butter.  The chowder was so rich, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens (unless I'm on a first date.)\n\nLet me close with what I'd tell MB if he was interested in my Crudopinion:  Bauer, they're on to you.  They know who you are, and/or they know when you are coming.  I bet they have some \"special\" they offer you that is not on the menu when you're there, am I right?  There was no special for me tonight.  This place was good, but I'm not sure it was Top 100 good.

I personally enjoyed the Char, as it is difficult to find anyplace that even serves Char. Also, the oysters are fantastic in that they are fresh - and that you have a choice of like 6 different varieties.\n\nAside from the raw bar, they have great cooked dishes such as a mussels and clam dish in a light red sauce - and the absolute BEST seafood chowder. Do yourself a favor and order the chowder. Most chowder I've ever had, I am wondering where the fish is. It is chopped up and hiding as if the chef took the scraps from other dishes to make the stew. Well, not at Bar Crudo. The chowder is filled with big bites of identifiable fish in every bite, and somehow none of it is over-cooked - which is hard to do in a soup-type situation. \n\nIf you are absolutely starving and looking for a hearty meal, this might not be the place for you. Being a restaurant that specializes in raw fish, they really focus on the delicate flavors that raw fish has to offer. Savor each bite, and leave satisfied - not stuffed.\n\nAdditional tips on how to enjoy this place:\nYes, it is hyped. It is crowded. It is small. Be prepared for that. Make a reservation or show up as soon as it opens or you will be waiting a long time for a table or spot at the bar.\n\nThe service is, how shall I say....European? It is slow.

What it comes down to is: quality v. quanitity.  Remember this while dining and shed yourself of your American tendencies.

There are certain wines that go w/ raw foods and pinot noir definetely is not one of them (well at least not the med to full bodied ones one the menu).

Partly because they gave us 2 by mistake and only charged us for one so we couldn't finish it.  Very nice of them.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes!

I had wanted to go here for what seems like FOREVER, so when we pulled up in front of Bar Crudo to start our evening, I was ecstatic and almost jumped out of the car before he could come to a full stop to drop me off!\n\nWe shared a bottle of Riesling over delectable Kushi oysters and Bluepoints that they had in stock for that evening.  You have to request horseradish separately, which is something I never did understand for any place that serves fresh oysters, but what they bring you is perfectly grated FRESH horseradish.  Crudo menu is fantastic - most notable was the Kanpachi crudo dish.  Four thick slivers of fresh, raw fish, with some nuts and a lovely, slightly tart huckleberry sauce drizzled over it.  It's a remarkable bundle of tastes.  This particular fish has a bit less flavor than typical yellowtail sashimi, but that actually allows the accompaniments to bring it to life, whereas the typical yellowtail sashimi's buttery flavor would kill the accompaniments that grace this dish.  Gazpacho was refreshing - -  a bit of seafood in the middle with a fresh, watermelon-infused cold soup.  Really nice.  We ordered more things - and everything was just truly fresh -  and flavorful.  Bar Crudo really knows how to dress up their raw seafood - - and presents it in a fashion that makes it look so appealing.\n\nService was very good, and even when it became a full house, we never felt neglected.  I should mention the water they gave us - - - somehow, without any change in color, I could taste a bit of watermelon flavor in the water.  I can't say I liked the water itself - - but what it did do at room temperature was serve as palate cleanser everytime you took a swig.  When dealing with a crudo menu - - this served most useful.  Fascinating... I'd have never thought of it.\n\n***********************************************\nSecond time:\n\nAnother night out to dinner w/ Archie the Manly Man.\nThis  time, we order champagne, which I always enjoy with oysters.  The champagne was no Veuve Cliquot, but a Brut 1+1=3.  Really, that was what it was called, and our server recommended it, so we accepted.  Great, it was not, but it got us pretty buzzed so it did what it was supposed to do.\nI was out to challenge Archie's allegedly newfound love of oysters, which he claimed at our last dinner at Ella where I had to twist his arm to get him to try raw oysters.  We'll see.  First, we order Kushi oysters - but they are out, so we end up getting Luna and something else, which name I cannot recall.  Oysters were good but not as good as last time.  I dress my oyster, Archie follows point by point.  I eat - - he eats.  Wow.  He actually does look like he's enjoying oysters.... Reminder to self, take this blossoming oyster-lover-wannabe to Hog Island one day.\n\nGiven this was his first time, I didn't want to risk ordering anything new and ruining his experience here, so I opted to order much of the same as last time, but fewer items as this was only an appetizer for us before the real dinner.  \nEverything was as good as the first time - -  but they had run out of Gazpacho, which was too bad because I really did enjoy that soup last time.  Most notable this night was the scallops w' corn puree..  The Konpachi was good but not as good as  the first time.  The Ono we had was very tasty... but again, it's the freshness that is really impressive.\n\nThere was no watermelon-flavored water, though.\n\n***********************************************\n\nBar Crudo is a place that is more appealing as a \"let's have a drink and get some good appetizer\" place rather than a full dinner location.  Very fresh fish, and I'd dare to guess that the majority of the things on their menu will be good.\nIt is expensive, though.  If you love raw seafood like I do, it can run way beyond $100 pp if you eat here in hopes of filling yourself.  I would just recommend you come here for a plate or three of appetizers, have a couple drinks and be off to a real dinner, like I did on both occasions.\nThe dining area upstairs is very small, and the seafood bar downstairs, while pleasant, is also small.  Make reservations if you want a table, they're available on www.opentable.com and I've had no problems getting one thus far.\n\nBut food aside - what makes Bar Crudo amazing is that in all this time, I have NEVER, EVER seen such an extensive list of Belgian Beers available, from Chimay Blue, Stella, etc.  There must be at least 40 different kinds of Belgian Ales available, a variety of IPAs and double IPAs, etc.  I daresay you'd be hardpressed to find this many Belgian Beers in one place outside of Brussels or something.\n\nFor that alone - BC would get 5 stars, but add in the fresh fish, and you might as well call it \"BAR GRACE\"!!!!\n\n\nThis is the good life, folks.... give it a whirl.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-10-07"}, {"excerpts": ["it's small and casual with a really friendly wait staff.

Opened in November 2005, by twin brothers Mike (the chef) and Tim (the house manager) Selvera, Bar Crudo has taken the raw-bar food craze to a new level. Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane. As the evening was rather chilly on my first visit, I tried the marvelously rich seafood chowder with lots of fresh clams, fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, red potatoes, and smoky applewood smoked bacon ($10). Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster. The crudo (raw fish) is the main focus of the menu and includes gloriously spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha, and green onions ($12); Rhode Island black bass with hard quail egg, habanero tobiko and blood orange reduction ($9); and not-to-be-missed arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill ($10). In case you don't like seafood, try the artisan cheese plate with flower honey, seasonal fruit, medjool dates, and nutty walnut bread ($11) and the sherry duck liver mousse with green pepper corns, cornichons and grilled bread. Their rich flavors and tempting texture blend nicely together.  And if you're indecisive about what to have for dessert, don't worry. There's only one item available on the menu, decadent XOX truffles ($6) that were definitely worth the wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to dine alone, or perhaps with your friends or someone special, Bar Crudo's delicious seafood and quaint atmosphere are definitely a winning combination.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["very small -- or cozy as most would describe it\nraw bar, offerings prevent vegetarians from eating here\n\non the grand scheme of things, I place sashimi over tiradito over crudo over ceviche.

They (and the kitchen) are good at bringing things out at a good pace, not rushing, and trying not to crowd the small tables too much.\n\nThird, the food is very good and interesting. We split the small seafood platter. When we expressed interest in a variety of oysters, the server suggested adding a more complete selection for a slight added cost. We feasted on raw oysters, raw clams, one of the best mussels i've ever tasted, big prawns, and excellent, fresh Dungeness crab. Afterwards, a bar crudo sampler. The best of the 4 were teh dayboat scallops and then , was it the arctic char with some wasabi roe. My sis really enjoyed the fluke with the quail egg (quail eggs rule!) and a thin slice of jamon serrano(?). Finally, we ended with an overly rich yellow tomato and yellow watermelon gazpacho. It was finished with a bit too much olive oil, so after the initial 4-5 sips, it got too rich. However, the lobster salad with burrata cheese and heirloom tomatoes was scrumptious. I'd never had burrata with lobster before, and it was heaven. Yes, it still lingers in the mind. The last dish was what pushed us over our limit -- mussels in some rich tomato sauce and was it chorizo? It tasted really good, but we were completely full by then. \n\nI'm going to have to lay off the spending at Anthro, Therapy, the Candystore through the next year, so I can afford to go back a couple more times in the next year. \n\nI wouldn't mind trying to sit at the raw bar downstairs next time.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-09-15"}, {"excerpts": ["I liked that it was small, only about 9 tables upstairs, and bar room on the first floor.

Every time I have gone, I have had such a pleasurable experience! Last night I went with my boyfriend and we sat at the bar since we didn't have a reservation and there were no tables. This was my second time sitting at the bar, and I actually liked it better because you can converse with the chefs and it's much more informal. We shared one raw dish (butterfish with avocado mousse and peaches) and one cold dish (San Sebastian: tuna confit, asparagus, roasted red peppers, arbequina olives, caper berries, manchego, tomato bread). The butterfish was new to the menu and it was delicious, though a very small portion for what you're paying - as are most of the raw dishes. The San Sebastian is one of my favorite dishes on the menu because it's perfect for sharing, all of the flavors are great separate or mixed together, and it's actually quite a bit of food. For our hot dishes, my boyfriend ordered the Hamachi collar and I chose to have a bowl of the seafood chowder, because it's literally the best chowder I have ever tried. I've ordered cups every time I had been there before, and last night I knew I needed the full bowl. I told my boyfriend that he could try some, because it was sooooo good! He ended up finishing less than half of the bowl in addition to his Hamachi, and described the chowder as \"the best thing I've ever had.\" The chorizo in it makes a difference, and you're also getting huge chunks of all different sorts of fish so it's very hearty and filling - and not too creamy.

Located on Divisadero Street and central to your foodie 3 blocks radius, this is a good place to grab some seafood.  \n\nParking can be a difficult cat and mouse game, and praying for the parking gods can turn something up... but when dining in Divisadero (north of the panhandle district), one must remember to bring coins, sharp eyes, and be ready to chow down with any restaurants as your selection.\n\nWe walked into the door and was greeting by Drew and told him we have a reservation. He told us to wait near the bar so the host can seat us. After we sat, Drew came back and ask us how was our day. Friendly, personal, and a great way to start our anniversary dinner. He also told us that we still apply to the happy hour special since we are early.  \n\nDrinks - Lambrusco sparkling red wine by the glass.\n\nWife wanted some sweet dessert wine (not for paring the seafood), but more for a good night out. With the recommendation, it wasn't bad.  I opt for just your normal water by the glass.\n\nOur first arrival - 1/2 Dozen Miyagi oysters from Tomales Bay, 4 Kumamoto from Washington. \n\nThe Special on this selection was the $1 Miyagi Oyster from Tomales Bay. We thought to give it a try. Along with the happy hour special, my wife loves Kumamoto and we proceed in ordering them on the main menu. The Oyster came on a chilled filled iced, and 6 Oysters on the left and the other half on the right. The middle center were two small dip sauce with a slice of lemon to wake th Oyster up.  \n\nWe must say, the Miyagi Oyster is by far tasty than the Kumamoto. It had a better taste, and more rich of freshness. A good way to start the seafood catch. \n\u00a0\nSecond arrival - Peel & Eat Gulf Prawns.  \n\nWe ordered four and our vision of Gulf Prawns where the black giant tiger prawns.  Boy were we wrong! As it arrived, we didn't think much of it until we took a double take. Is this Gulf Prawn? It wasn't bad in size but it wasn't giant size also. Your typical Prawn steam an chilled, then served on ice with dipping sauce with lemon at the center.\n\u00a0\nThird arrival - Crudo for Two: \nArctic char - horseradish creme fraiche, Wasabi tobiko, dill.  Scallop - corn puree, radish, chive.  Butterfish - pickled fennel, espellete pepper, Basile.  Tombo tuna - citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko\n\nWow. What a fresh taste! The the butterfish with a little hint of spice from the espellete pepper made your tongue sensor go wild and then calm with the mixture of Basile and fennel into the mix. The citrus and chili in the Tambo tuna lighten the mouth with fruit texture and a clean popping wash of the yuzu tobiko on each bite. The Arctic char had the smokey taste but a small clear of the noise of the Wasabi tobiko. And finally, the scallop is so fresh that it melt in your mouth on each bite. No need to chew like a gum, it just melt!   \n\u00a0\nForth arrival - Lobster and Tomato Salad: Burrata, little gems, corn, banyuls vinaigrette.\n\nThis dish is refreshing and light. It had all the right mixture but wished it had a little more lobster. But overall, a nice light dish to pack into the balance meal with greens/veggies.\n\u00a0\nFifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\nWe shared a large Chowder bowl and it was under the happy hour pricing. Can't beat that! The wifey said she could have passed on this dish, but I enjoyed it. It is different from other Chowder bowls we've tried, but it is just a little salty. If you didn't get bread on the side, it is a must to balance off the saltiness that comes from the Bacon, Cream, and Butter? \n\nSixth arrival - Roasted Crab: scallions, aleppo pepper, chili, verjus, tarrgon.\n\nWe wanted to give the crab a try as some reviewer mention it is a taste to try. Since we are here for seafood, why not! The Aleppo pepper and chili sure pack some heat to this dish. I like it but it is really messy. We were advise to be dirty when chowing down on this dish and we continued to say, bring it on. The crab isnt big and with each bite brought a good heat to the mouth and the tomato base tried to smooth out the heat. Overall, we will pass on this dish.\n\u00a0\nSeventh arrival - Crude for Two.\nWhat can we say, we wanted round #2 and nothing will explain more than Yum!\n\u00a0\nFinal arrival - Truffles on the house. \nWhat a surprise and Drew gave us House made Truffles for our Happy Anniversary dinner. All I have to say, it was tasty and sweet! The last taste of the night and it was good.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nA local small seafood hangout and must try during happy hours. We left with a fulfilled night out and all the dishes ordered were good to great. The noise level can be a little high as the place is small with high ceilings which echoes back conversation your next table patron having on heated discussion (or argument).

Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so.

It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish.

Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own!

Other happy hour priced bar bites included the shishito peppers (meh), the spicy-tinged marinated mussels (liked the spice), and $1 oysters.\n\nThe dinner menu proved more promising, if more expensive. The menu is sparse, split into three entree-ish sections: raw, cold, hot. Like many a modern restaurant, dishes aren't meant to be eaten in traditional appetizer to entree form.

Parking requires some advance planning. If there's a show at the independent, then you better rely on the parking lot 3 blocks away (fell and broderick).  The lot across the street from bar crudo is a sketchy lot of a pot clinic/trailer or something. Not the best spot to take your chances.  The issue with the parking lot 3 blocks away is that it's a pretty big parking lot (100-150 cars?) and there's only ONE machine to pay.  So there was a line of 4 people in front of us on a saturday night (which doesn't seem too bad except the machine has about 12 steps) and the two 60+ year old guys in the front couldn't figure out how to use the machine and managed to get their credit card stuck in there for a solid 5 minutes.  Then there's the woman with the crying baby who can't get the coupon code for bi-rite market to work in the machine.  The list of issues go on and on.  So yeah...definitely allocate 15minutes extra for parking.

For such a posh and modern looking place, service is surprisingly casual and friendly, in a good way.\n\nTo start, I had the Crudo Sampler.  The Crudo Sampler comes with an all-star lineup of Arctic Char, Hokkaido Scallops, Tombo Tuna, and Butterfish.  All the seafood tasted really fresh with unexpected, yet clean flavor combinations.\n\nThe Hokkaido Scallop was interesting with the roasted apple and celery root puree and truffle salt.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it still tasted great.  The Tombo Tuna was also a little bit on the sweet side, but the sweetness of the hazelnut and pear was balanced with a nice tartness from the pomegranate reduction.  The Butterfish was one of my favorites, topped with olive, black garlic, shiso, and an orange vinaigrette.  I don't think I would have thought any of these ingredients would go together, but somehow, they did.  The fish itself was out of this world, and only tasted better with a great mix of sweetness and acidity.\n\nThe star of the sampler, however, was the Arctic Char.  The freshness of the actual char harmonizes perfectly with the spiciness of the horseradish cream and wasabi tobiko eggs.  Top that all with a bit of dill, and you got yourself a real winner.  Overall, the sampler is the best way to get a good idea of Bar Crudo's food.\n\nI also got a Beef Tartare topped four ways.  Each was topped with either an egg yolk, hot pepper, horseradish cream, or a sardine.  All were great, and the beef was really clean and fresh, but were a little less interesting than some of the other dishes.\n\nFinally, I got the Uni Avocado Toast.  I love uni, I love avocado, and I love toast.  So I thought this would be a great combination.  And it was.  It was a little heavy on the fattiness, but a little fat never hurt anyone.  There was also a side sudachi, frisee, and herb salad.

Toronado, of course, has $1 off draft beers from opening until 6 p.m. At Lucky 13 in San Francisco, you can drink fresh Pliny the Elder, Dogfish Head 90, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Anchor Liberty and many more for $3 a pint from opening until 8:30 p.m. Most other beer bars offer some variation of a happy hour from around 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. or so. (Don't forget to tip $1 per beer.)\nBut one of the best happy hours in the city isn't even at a beer bar; it's at Bar Crudo on Divisadero. Bar Crudo's selection of some four-dozen bottled beers, along with a handful of well-chosen taps, would put many so-called beer bars to shame. But what sets Bar Crudo apart is its happy hour food. Usually, happy hour in a bar means a few munchies, Buffalo wings, or something deep-fried and virtually unrecognizable. At Bar Crudo, a lot of the food never goes near a flame, let alone a deep fryer. Bar Crudo, as its name implies, specializes in raw dishes, mostly seafood -- six types of fresh oysters; five types of clams; and small plates of raw arctic char, butterfish, Tomba tuna, Hokkaido scallops, spicy yellowfin tuna and Hawaiian ono -- as well as steak crudo and several other \"cold\" preparations. You can also order cooked seafood, as well as delicious seafood chowder, brimming with large chunks of fish, and fish tacos ($5 at happy hour). \nWhile other restaurants conceal frozen fish under deep frying batter or buttery sauces, at Bar Crudo there's no place to hide. Preparation is subtle and minimal, allowing the fish to be the star of the show.  \nThe lineup of five draft beers matches well with the food: Moonlight Brewing Reality Czech ($3 a pint during a happy hour recently), Allagash White Belgian-style wit beer (which adds some spritzy, subtly lemony zest to the oysters and raw seafood), Firestone Walker Solace, Russian River IPA and the 30th anniversary stout from Sierra Nevada and Anchor Brewing. (When you see Russian River and Moonlight on tap, it's a good sign; those brewers, who distribute their kegs themselves from Santa Rosa, love showcasing their beer with great food, and they're very selective.) \nThe extensive list of nearly 50 bottles is also carefully crafted to complement the fresh seafood, from Hitachino Nest White Ale and Bavik Pils to Ommegang Ale, Gouden Carolus and Duchesse de Bourgogne Flanders red ale (for those with a sour tooth). Wines are well-matched as well, with some sparklers like German Gilabert Cava Brut and whites and reds from France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Chile, Argentina and Napa. \nBar Crudo moved to what is now known as NOPA (north of the Panhandle) last year from its original location above the Stockton Street tunnel. The highlight of the new restaurant is clearly the fish itself, along with the people who deftly prepare it. There aren't any TVs, but that's OK when you can watch gifted chefs work their magic live and in real time. \nBar Crudo is taking California cuisine to a new level, showing the culinary world what can be accomplished with simple, fresh ingredients matched with great beer like Allagash White and Moonlight Reality Czech poured fresh from a tap. The overall experience is sublime, and when you can have half a dozen fresh oysters, a delicious cup of fish chowder or fish tacos and two excellent pilsners for less than $20, it's almost irresistible.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-06-05"}, {"excerpts": ["This came with a very large bowl of mussels simmered in a Belgian beer sauce with scallions and bratwurst.

It was cozy, but you still had room to have private conversation. We couldn't help but look over at the couple across from us who were like the dining dead they describe in Eternal Sunshine. Both were texting or checking email on their iphones instead of talking to each other... how sad.\n\nThe crudo sampler started with the scallop with micro greens and what was very much like a chickpea puree. The flavors with subtle and the textures were perfect together. After that they recommended we try the tombo tuna with lemongrass and siracha. That was probably one of the most delicious pieces of fish I've had in a while. It was extremely fresh and none of the flavors overtook the dish (which is difficult with siracha).\n\nThey followed this with a kampachi with hazlenuts and pears. It was sweet and salty at the same time, acting as a perfect following to the tuna. Finally we ended with the arctic char, which had horseradish and wasabi tobiako. It was one of the freshest pieces of fish I've had in a long time and the spice of real wasabi was also not overpowering. \n\nWe continued with the lobster, beet and burrata salad with watercress. Dear god please get that salad. It had giant pieces of lobster and they served golden beets with it. Everything was so fresh and the flavors were absolutely perfect together. This came with a very large bowl of mussels simmered in a Belgian beer sauce with scallions and bratwurst. This dish went splendidly with my pint of Rocket Red ale. The mussels were very large, very fresh and came in a huge portion.\n\nWe ended with a cup of the seafood chowder and that was the only thing neither of us were crazy about. For me, it was far too heavy and a cup would be great for about 4 people. It had a good flavor, but it's essentially bacon flavored cream that happens to include squid. If I hadn't enjoyed the rest of the meal and much as I did, I might have favored the soup more.\n\nIt was casual, but a fantastic evening.

I had never been to the old location, but everyone said this new location was quite a bit larger - the old space must have been tiny because I would definitely not describe the space as large.  Basically it is a narrow room with about 10 small tables (2-3 people), a bar, and a loft/balcony upstairs.  \n\nOur waitress was great, she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations for us.  My boyfriend had an oyster that he loved, and could not stop raving about the lobster heirloom tomato salad with beretta cheese.  This was a great recommendation - the boyfriend LOVED it, as did every other table (it was the only dish that I saw everyone else order).  There was no skimping on the lobster, I'm talking about huge chunks of claw meat on top of the salad.  \n\nWe also had the steak tartare - it was beautiful.  Four separate mounds of tartare with different toppings (horseradish creme fresh, quail egg, anchovy, pepper).   All served with grilled bread.  There was a definite citrus flavor on the meat and lots of fresh herbs.  \n\nThe last stand out dish was the bowl of chowder.  I am not always a fan of chowder because so many times it just tastes creamy with no other flavor.  How to make a chowder better you ask?  Well, how do you make anything better?  Add bacon.  This chowder was infused with chunks of smoky, salty, porky bacon.  It was also filled with fish, clams, calamari, muscles, shrimp, and potato.  I would really describe this dish as more of a collection of seafood in a bacon cream sauce, but no matter what you call it - it was delicious.  \n\nBar Crudo has a short menu, but a fairly extensive beer and wine list.  Food is small plates, so you will need 5-6 dishes to get two people full.  Lots of cooked food for friends/family that cannot eat raw - but don't take a vegetarian here, I am not sure there is anything on the menu for veggies.

Determined to try all restaurants that have made the cut, I've been to 31 so far.  But, the experience has not felt complete... something is missing.  My mid-year resolution: add a final Yelp step to the process.  Bar Crudo is my first.\n\nI was solo tonight, and lucky me there was a single seat at the bar which was not reserved.  I love sitting at an oyster or sushi bar, right in the middle of the action, and I like it even more if the people behind the bar serve booze.  As I people-watched, I noticed that I seemed to be the only person without a reservation, which was a surprise to me considering it was a Monday night at 6 pm.  I bet this place gets crudo crazy later in the week.\n\nThe wine list was fairly unimpressive, although the beer selection was crudonculous.  I opted for the only Pinot (Noir in this review and all others) on the menu, which came in a bottle that had a cap instead of a cork.  I'll never get used to that; I don't care how \"green\" it is.\n\nI decided to start with the Crudo sampler appetizer.  I'm pretty sure that I was the first person who put an order in for the evening, however, the wait time was way too long.  Maybe not that long in crudo minutes, but certainly long in normal appetizer minutes.  It's ok though, because while I am waiting, I get to witness the spectrum of skill level in oyster shucking.  First guy, coulda done it blindfolded.  Second guy, I coulda used a blindfold, as I was certain this guy would slice his finger off before the dozenth oyster was open.\n\nI understood the wait time when the sampler arrived.  There were four kinds of crudo, each more delicate and intricate than the previous.  The one I was really excited about trying was the Hawaiian Ono, which had lemongrass, citrus, mint, chili, tobiko, and more on it.  I LOVE all of those things.  Did I love all those things together?  Not so much.  I expected some sort of crazy crudo chemical reaction in my mouth, which didn't happen.  Instead, it just tasted like a bunch of random ingredients thrown together for an experiment.  Very disappointing.  Thank goodness for the second crudo - the arctic char, which had just a few logical ingredients and was heaven.  In my industry, I'd recommend the KISS technique to the Crudoians.... Keep It Simple, Stupid; sometimes less is more.\n\nIt was cold outside, and there were only a couple of hot dishes on the menu.  I opted for a small seafood chowder, which was surprisingly large.  The first bite was beautiful, and I decided Bauer was onto something.  After the third bite, however, I was certain that I could replicate the chowder at home with a pint of cream and a few sticks of butter.  The chowder was so rich, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens (unless I'm on a first date.)\n\nLet me close with what I'd tell MB if he was interested in my Crudopinion:  Bauer, they're on to you.  They know who you are, and/or they know when you are coming.  I bet they have some \"special\" they offer you that is not on the menu when you're there, am I right?  There was no special for me tonight.  This place was good, but I'm not sure it was Top 100 good.

In our wanders we've introduced them to good chocolate (Recchiuti), pizza (Amici's), pastries (Tartine) and coffee (Ritual) - so we had to find somwthing better than average when we were asked to find a good place that served dungeness crab. We chose Bar Crudo and were rewarded for making that choice.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant is a (not so hidden) gem - a few seats at the main floor bar, and a few tables on top. Arriving on time, we were seated upstairs at the edge of the loft, giving us a perfect view of the kitchen area and were promptly brought cucumber water (and later a carafe of it) and the menus. \r\n\r\nThe first thing to notice is the fairness of the prices. A perfectly prepared half of a dungeness crab was $15 and ranked almost as high as the fresh-from-the-boat crab we had last weekend. Four well sized pieces of crudo ran $10, and the amazing fish chowder another $10. The wine averaged in the mid $30 range and the restaurant also sported an excellent selection of Belgian beer.\r\n\r\nThe crab, as I mentioned, was perfect and served with clarified butter, a spicy sauce and a large crayfish. The crudo sampler had some amazing pieces (the arctic char) and some that were simply great. Then again, we're hard to impress with just excellent quality raw fish based on the amount of sushi we had. The joy of crudo is in the flavors that bring out the best quality of the seafood. I'm happy that I did the sampler as four pieces of even the most excellent char would have been too much.\r\n\r\nAs is appropriate, the cooked or more heavily flavored dishes followed the simpler ones. For our friends who started with the crab, a tuna confit followed. For my wife and I, our crudo was followed by the best chowder I have had in a decade - a perfect bisque with expertly boiled potatos and morsels of seafood (the cod and squid were perfect). We ended with the cheese plate - three well selected cheese balanced with honey, dates and perfect slices of walnut toast - lightly  buttered and grilled. The toast was so good, we had to ask for more to end the meal.

Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane.

Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster.

For starters, if you didn't realize it by now or if you just started reading my reviews, I'm really adamant about being a planner. Weekend getaways, date night, family trip, happy hours after work, etc...I'm normally the one choosing where. This was one of the rare times I let someone else take the reigns and go.

We ordered rounds of fresh oysters, mussels, shishito peppers, seafood chowder, uni toast, manila clams, the crudo sampler, and this crab head thing that we're going to call Crab Butter Thing (I'll explain shortly). \n\nThe chowder was incredibly rich and the mussels were delish! I loved the manila clams because they were prepared in a white wine sauce which is exactly how I prefer them. The uni toast was crunchy and crispy and went well against the creamy uni! As for the crudo, if you don't know what crudo is, it's pretty much like sashimi, presented in different ways with different flavors the way you would prepare poke. Since we got the sampler, we had a little bit of everything. The servers recommend you eat it in a certain order, from lightest in flavor to heaviest. Our favorite was the Tombo Tuna because of the bright citrusy flavors! \n\nNow onto the dish of the night...the crab butter thing. It wasn't on the menu, but our friend said it was last time he came, so he asked if they had the \"crab heads with the stuff inside\" (LOL this is verbatim!!). They happily brought it out for us because they said they just forgot to add it to that nights menu. The crab is served cold and you dip the bread into the decadent insides and it's heaven.

Steep for very little food, but the problem was, while they may have been fresh, they were overcooked to the point of being mushy.  They tasted like they had spent too much time in the poaching pot, or had been previously frozen.  If I hadn't been sharing with new friends they would have gone back.  Our plate of 4 different raw seafood bites was quite good, but only the scallops really woke up my palate.  more please.  The seafood chowder ($9 for small bowl) was mostly a heavy cream stock.  Very little seafood was present, and the cream only had a faint seafood flavor.  That was a lot of calories for very little punch.  We shared mains.  I ordered the whole branzino ($32), and while the plate was beautiful, and the chili-herb \"salsa\" was tasty, if not inspiring, but the tasty branzino was again overcooked so much that it would have been entirely edible for someone without teeth.  What a waste of a nice fish.  My favorite part of the dish was the stocky salsa mixture which I scooped off the plate when the fish was gone.  Other dishes fared a bit better, but only the memory of the briny scallop stayed with me after the big check was delivered.  \nPreviously, I would have returned, if someone else really wanted to eat there, since it's in my neighborhood and a short walk from home, but after last Sundays dinner, I'll try to steer clear. Too bad.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-06-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Fifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\n"], "author": "Mike T.", "review": "A hidden location if you don't seek carefully, but a nice place for those seafood hunger. Located on Divisadero Street and central to your foodie 3 blocks radius, this is a good place to grab some seafood.  \n\nParking can be a difficult cat and mouse game, and praying for the parking gods can turn something up... but when dining in Divisadero (north of the panhandle district), one must remember to bring coins, sharp eyes, and be ready to chow down with any restaurants as your selection.\n\nWe walked into the door and was greeting by Drew and told him we have a reservation. He told us to wait near the bar so the host can seat us. After we sat, Drew came back and ask us how was our day. Friendly, personal, and a great way to start our anniversary dinner. He also told us that we still apply to the happy hour special since we are early.  \n\nDrinks - Lambrusco sparkling red wine by the glass.\n\nWife wanted some sweet dessert wine (not for paring the seafood), but more for a good night out. With the recommendation, it wasn't bad.  I opt for just your normal water by the glass.\n\nOur first arrival - 1/2 Dozen Miyagi oysters from Tomales Bay, 4 Kumamoto from Washington. \n\nThe Special on this selection was the $1 Miyagi Oyster from Tomales Bay. We thought to give it a try. Along with the happy hour special, my wife loves Kumamoto and we proceed in ordering them on the main menu. The Oyster came on a chilled filled iced, and 6 Oysters on the left and the other half on the right. The middle center were two small dip sauce with a slice of lemon to wake th Oyster up.  \n\nWe must say, the Miyagi Oyster is by far tasty than the Kumamoto. It had a better taste, and more rich of freshness. A good way to start the seafood catch. \n\u00a0\nSecond arrival - Peel & Eat Gulf Prawns.  \n\nWe ordered four and our vision of Gulf Prawns where the black giant tiger prawns.  Boy were we wrong! As it arrived, we didn't think much of it until we took a double take. Is this Gulf Prawn? It wasn't bad in size but it wasn't giant size also. Your typical Prawn steam an chilled, then served on ice with dipping sauce with lemon at the center.\n\u00a0\nThird arrival - Crudo for Two: \nArctic char - horseradish creme fraiche, Wasabi tobiko, dill.  Scallop - corn puree, radish, chive.  Butterfish - pickled fennel, espellete pepper, Basile.  Tombo tuna - citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko\n\nWow. What a fresh taste! The the butterfish with a little hint of spice from the espellete pepper made your tongue sensor go wild and then calm with the mixture of Basile and fennel into the mix. The citrus and chili in the Tambo tuna lighten the mouth with fruit texture and a clean popping wash of the yuzu tobiko on each bite. The Arctic char had the smokey taste but a small clear of the noise of the Wasabi tobiko. And finally, the scallop is so fresh that it melt in your mouth on each bite. No need to chew like a gum, it just melt!   \n\u00a0\nForth arrival - Lobster and Tomato Salad: Burrata, little gems, corn, banyuls vinaigrette.\n\nThis dish is refreshing and light. It had all the right mixture but wished it had a little more lobster. But overall, a nice light dish to pack into the balance meal with greens/veggies.\n\u00a0\nFifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\nWe shared a large Chowder bowl and it was under the happy hour pricing. Can't beat that! The wifey said she could have passed on this dish, but I enjoyed it. It is different from other Chowder bowls we've tried, but it is just a little salty. If you didn't get bread on the side, it is a must to balance off the saltiness that comes from the Bacon, Cream, and Butter? \n\nSixth arrival - Roasted Crab: scallions, aleppo pepper, chili, verjus, tarrgon.\n\nWe wanted to give the crab a try as some reviewer mention it is a taste to try. Since we are here for seafood, why not! The Aleppo pepper and chili sure pack some heat to this dish. I like it but it is really messy. We were advise to be dirty when chowing down on this dish and we continued to say, bring it on. The crab isnt big and with each bite brought a good heat to the mouth and the tomato base tried to smooth out the heat. Overall, we will pass on this dish.\n\u00a0\nSeventh arrival - Crude for Two.\nWhat can we say, we wanted round #2 and nothing will explain more than Yum!\n\u00a0\nFinal arrival - Truffles on the house. \nWhat a surprise and Drew gave us House made Truffles for our Happy Anniversary dinner. All I have to say, it was tasty and sweet! The last taste of the night and it was good.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nA local small seafood hangout and must try during happy hours. We left with a fulfilled night out and all the dishes ordered were good to great. The noise level can be a little high as the place is small with high ceilings which echoes back conversation your next table patron having on heated discussion (or argument).

I like it really chunky & thick. Also - could NOT taste the bacon anywhere! And I was so excited about that part.\n\n* Whole Roasted Branzino - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-crudo-san-francisco?select=TTmCx5UQJJ6AChqa5ZEy0Q#hWBrm2YnfSxgg6X7Xgj1WQ\n(purple, green, and yellow cauliflower, tapenade, arugula. $27)\nFan-freaking-tastic.

"], "author": "Kaje Y.", "review": "There were 5 of us, with no reservation, at the end of the night. The wait time was about 15-20 minutes. We were allowed to stand on the side behind the bar and order some drinks. There is a fairly large selection of beer that ranges from so-so beers to good beers. I wanted to be adventurous and try two beers I've never tried before. Unfortunately I picked two that were not really to my liking. Oh well.\n\nWe sat down for dinner and contemplated what to order. We were told that the kitchen closes in 30 minutes, so we'd have to order soon. Our waiter was very nice, amicable, and very attentive. Props for this! It was busy and he made sure we were taken care of.\n\nFood:\n++Sashimi (Artic Char, Salmon, Tuna) - We asked for some honest opinions on which ones to order. Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so. Our cuts were fairly fresh, but it definitely wasn't the freshest sashimi I've had. The portions were large and usually come with 4 pieces per order, but they were able to do 5 and prorate the 5th piece proportionally. \n\n++Uni Avocado Toast - These were okay, but definitely not great. It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish. On it's own, the uni was pretty good and paired well with the avocado, but leaves you scratching your head asking what completes this dish? Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own! Other than that, the lighting is dimmed, and its very cozy and intimate. Good for small parties and perhaps dates.\n\nOverall, the service was good, and the food was decent, but I was really hoping for this place to blow my mind. The price is just a bit on the more expensive side for what you get, but overall isn't bad. Everything in this review directs it to a A-Ok rating. Sums it up perfectly.\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend this place, but I'm sure that won't stop you from going.

Reservations at 6 meant just in time to squeeze in happy hour (which ends at 6:30), and the soup-loving parentals dug the $5 seafood chowder cups.\n\nThe chowder came chocked with seafood goodness, while the bacon-infused broth reminded me more of a thick, hearty bisque than a brothy, satisfying soup. Other happy hour priced bar bites included the shishito peppers (meh), the spicy-tinged marinated mussels (liked the spice), and $1 oysters.\n\nThe dinner menu proved more promising, if more expensive. The menu is sparse, split into three entree-ish sections: raw, cold, hot. Like many a modern restaurant, dishes aren't meant to be eaten in traditional appetizer to entree form. Mixing in a big group is preferable.\n\nThe raw dishes are perhaps Bar Crudo's finest offerings, a take on sashimi that clearly screams Asian fusion. We tried five of six, leaving off the most traditional Ahi Tuna cube. The creme fraiche Char is reportedly the house favorite. I most dug the Ono and its sweet-spicy-sour grapefruit-jalapeno complement, while the table fawned over the Fluke and Quail Egg, heavily laced with truffle oil. Word of caution: these bad boys are neither cheap nor filling.\n\nCold dishes were forgettable. I wouldn't order either the San Sebastian (tuna confit with various side dishes) or the lobster beet salad again, though the lobster chunks were thick and hearty.\n\nThe sauce for the head-on Louisiana Prawns was spicily delicious, though being from so close to the Gulf, I'd call it more \"Franks Red Hot\" than \"Lousiana Hot Sauce\" spicy. The whole roasted Branzino was a crowd-pleaser for this Asian table, and a very good dish to share for a large party.\n\nI was set to award Bar Crudo five stars until a visit to the nothing short of incredible Swan Oyster Depot the next day. The freshness of Swan put Bar Crudo to shame, and it was easy to see some of Bar Crudo's more egregious errors.

You must try it for yourself...\n\nSince he had been here before and we have similar taste in food, I asked him to order for us. Each dish and drink was like an even bigger and better surprise, even the order which he had them served was perfect. \n\nTo start he ordered a bottle of Allagash Curieux (Bourbon Barrel-Aged Tripel), served in wine glasses - it's such a smooth start to dinner. I was very impressed with this beer, but more so in the selection by my date. Absolutely perfect. \n\nThey brought in the first plate, the Bar Crudo Sampler for two. The arctic char with wasabi tobiko, hokkaido scallop, tombo tuna, butterfish with blood orange, radish, pink peppercorns. It was incredible and each piece melted in my mouth.\n\nNext up, the Oysters. *Le Sigh* I love raw oysters. While I loved them spicy, he liked the taste of the oyster itself. While we both agreed one was the BEST, I can't remember the name for the life of me. They had Kumamoto, Miyagi, Beausoleil, Malpeque, Kusshi and Pickering Passage. \n\nBefore the rest of the meal comes, he orders a bottle of Cinque Terre, a dry white wine that had a delicate bouquet and suited the seafood perfectly. While she is pouring, he tells me about the area of Cinque Terre's small coastal villages in region of Liguria in the province of La Spezia. I'm enchanted by my glass of wine and loving hearing about where it's from. \n\nNext up, the Lobster Beet salad, with gold and chiogga beets, burrata, mache, pistachios, banyuls vinaigrette. Very Beautiful and light. So delicious. \n\nThen to finish, the Seafood Chowder, which was perfection in itself. I don't think I have ever had anything like it and have thought about it quite a lot since that day. The bread is just as precious as you want to dunk every bit of it in that rich and wonderful soup.\n\nHe knew I'd love it and I did.

Made reservations on Opentable.com and changed it a couple of times (including day of). Parking was so easy on a Sunday late afternoon (around 5:15pm) so we arrived 20 minutes early. The hostess accommodated us and kindly guided us to our table - poured us cucumber infused water (yum!) and handed us the menu (HH and regular). \n\nSince we already knew what we wanted, we went ahead and ordered a few minutes later. The food came our relatively quickly (since most of it is raw) and the service was amazing! One lady kept coming over to our table to ask if everything was going alright and kept giving us bread for our sauces and soup. She was very nice and made the experience more delightful.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Miyagi Oysters $1 each\nMy bf loved his oysters (I didn't have any since I'm not a fan). He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it! Though don't get overboard cause it could get a bit salty. My bf commented that if a hot link were to be liquified, it would taste like this (the sauce). \n\n4. Crudo Sampler $13 (not on HH menu)\nCame with 4 different items: artic char, scallop, ono, and butterfish. My favorites were the artic char and the scallop. Though I didn't think it was spectacular (I think I had too high of an expectation from all the great reviews). Don't get me wrong, the fish were really fresh and the complex flavors were executed well, but I don't think I would crave for it... The ono and butterfish were too fatty and soft in texture for me. \n\n5. Seafood Chowder $5 \nNot your ordinary chowder. Not super thick, creamy, nor filling like clam chowder. It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal. Though the chowder looks small, it's packed with seafood (fish and shrimp) and potatoes! I asked for even more bread to accompany the chowder, which made it less tart-y and more delicious! :)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was great. Prices are good for seafood, but portions are pretty small. We managed to spend almost $50 for our pre-dinner happy hour snack.... The food was fresh and full of flavor, but I didn't think it was mind-blowning that I would come back anytime soon. I just wanted to try this place based on the great reviews.

We got water promptly. Unfortunately, we were unable to order for another 15 minutes - probably why they still let us order off the happy hour menu despite it being past the time.

The restaurant is pretty small, but they do have a bar area and we opted to sit there even though tables were available (the restaurant was full by the time we left at 8:45pm). We ordered:\n\n-Seafood Chowder (Fish, Mussels, Shrimp, Squid, Potatoes, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Large Bowl $14): Pretty good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the broth since it was too tangy for my taste, although I started liking it more as I ate it. However, they do not skip on the seafood, which was awesome! There were huge pieces of salmon and other seafood goodness in the chowder.\n-Uni Avocado Toast (Sudachi, Frisee Salad $10): A briny and delicious bite. I loved the pairing of uni/avocado, but was sad there were only two small pieces per order.\n-BBQ Hamachi Collar (Purple Potato Salad, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche, Arugula, Rosemary Sprig $15): This was ok, but I've definitely had better at Japanese restaurants. Also, the bbq sauce overpowered the taste of the hamachi, and I had to spit out a couple of scales that hadn't been scraped off. I would skip this dish.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the freshness and quality of the seafood, but I just didnt order anything that really wowed me aside from the uni avocado toast. I wish I had tried their crudo (a derrrrrr moment for me since that is basically the name of the restaurant!) because my friends who did said it was amazing. In any case, definitely order the crudo and other raw stuff if you come here and skip the cooked items! Also make sure you ask for the BREAD & BUTTER- it was delicious!

We were in absolutely no way disappointed.  We were only in San Francisco for two nights and wanted to get the best seafood we could get our hands on.  \n\nWe were greeted warmly at the door at 6:30 (our reservation was for 6:45, but our bus was early).  The place was pretty packed and we were directed to a little waiting area next to the bar and offered menus while we waited for our table.\n\nAfter we were seated, another gentleman, not our server, greeted us and asked if we had any questions about the menu.  We ordered several items (everything looked so good) and he helped us pick some beers from their incredibly well-rounded list.  \n\nHe explained to us how he would course the items we ordered, beginning with the Crudo, then the salad, then the crab, and finishing with the seafood chowder, because it was very heavy and rich.  He left us the beer and wine list, in case we wanted to try something else for our second round.  My date asked if we could keep a food menu as well, in case we needed to order more food.  The gentleman smiled and said, \"Oh, no you won't,\" in a sing-songy voice as he walked away.  I suppose if we had been other people, we may have been offended, but I thought it was funny.\n\nThe Butterfish and Ahi Tuna were our favorite of the five Crudo dishes, but the others were just as fresh and flavorful.  Each fish was paired with a sauce and some kind of ingredient, specific to complementing the characteristics of the fish.  The portions are a really good size, for the price.  We had planned to get a Crudo for 2 (8 pieces, 2 of each of four fish) and an order of Ahi (4 pieces).  The gentleman who took our order suggested that we get two pieces of each fish, so that we could try each of them, so he did an Open food charge for $6 for the 2 pieces of Tuna & they were all plated together nicely.  \n\nNext came the Octopus salad, with grilled octopus.  It was lightly charred, slightly smokey, served hot, and melted in your mouth!  Delicious!\n\nAs our server, a friendly dark haired lady, cleared the salad, my date ordered one of each of the five oysters.  She was able to add these to our order in time to get them on the same serving dish as the Dungeness crab we'd ordered.  Prior to the delivery of the shellfish, she brought our sauces: drawn butter, cocktail sauce, and mignonette.  He really enjoyed the oysters (the Kumamoto and Kusshi best of the five - I don't do oysters).  The crab was firm, fresh, yum.  I've never had chilled Dungeness crab before.  It did not disappoint at all.  \n\nAs we finished the crab, we looked at each other and knew that we didn't need the two cups of Seafood Chowder we'd ordered, although it looked amazing on the table next to us.  When our server checked on us, we asked (for the first time ever in our lives) if we could cancel the chowders, or if she'd already ordered them.  She said that she hadn't yet fired them - she was waiting to finish clearing our crab.  She was very gracious about cancelling them.  I'm just hoping that she really hadn't fired them yet!  \n\nWe made up for it by ordering another round of drinks and a cheese plate for dessert.  The dressings served with the cheese (a fresh quartered fig, marmalade, and honey) were good, but we weren't crazy about the cheeses themselves.  The bleu didn't have much taste and the camembert was more bitter than I like (I'm not sure that I've ever actually had camembert before).

So, I made reservations to come on his birthday. When we got there, they didn't have our reservation. However, the host was very accomodating and managed to seat us anyway. We got there about 6pm so Happy Hour was still in effect until 6:30pm. We ordered a dozen of raw oysters ($1 each), seafood chowder ($6) and manila clams ($6). The oysters were good but not great but we were happy that it was only $1 each. The seafood chowder had a lot of seafood in one little bowl but I thought it was just mediocre b/c they used too much heavy cream and was a bit too sour. The manila clams were delicious and probably the best item on the menu. The broth was very tasty and there was a good amount of clams.  When we were done with our HH meals, we ordered from the dinner menu - had the crudo sampler for two ($28), half a dozen of raw little neck clams ($2.50 each) and the lobster salad ($18)...all disappointments!!! The presentation of the food was beautiful but deceiving!!! It definitely looked better than it tasted. The crudo sampler had the arctic char (salmon), scallop, butterfish and ono. The seafood were NOT fresh at all!!! Fresh seafood does not taste fishy! Their \"raw\" seafood was served room temperature (not cold and refreshing) and tasted very fishy, like old fish that's been sitting around too long.  The raw little neck clams were a disappointment. We are such huge fans of them at Mission Rock Resort but these were not fresh, had dirt in them and again, not cold...served room temperature...yuk! The lobster salad was a joke for $18...few pieces of lobster that tasted so bland and was not even fresh and sweet. How can you mess up so bad on lobster? It was mixed with some bland beets, gooey cheese that looked like fresh mozarella and was topped with some greens and pistachio nuts. The pistachio nuts were the best in the salad. I'm a huge salad fan and this was a total failure! \n\nThis restaurant is very confused with their food. I noticed that everyone who gave great ratings only came for the happy hour and was happy with their HH food. If I came for their HH food, I think I would've given them a better rating too. But the people who ate their dinner were disappointed like me. I wouldn't mind paying top dollar for good tasting high quality food. At Bar Crudo, the seafood is not fresh, the food is not tasty and the price is too high for such low quality small portions. I do have to say they have great customer service. We were well attended and our host and server were both were friendly and attentive. Their complimentary bread and cucumber water was good. \n\nI forgot to mention the noise level at this place in CRAZY noisy. It's not even a big place but everyone was talking so loud. I had to shout to place my order and it was hard to have a decent conversation with my date. Not a great place for a first date or with kids. What a disappointment!!!

You equate one restaurant with one pure, superb dish and continue to return for years. Eventually, you go to recreate the epiphany of that first taste and find that the dish is the same, but the place is not. That dish is the seafood chowder and that place is Bar Crudo.\n\nMy husband and I sat at the bar one weeknight around 9pm. He ordered some oysters, a bowl of chowder, and a beer, and I, truth be told, having had half a carne asada burrito around 5pm, wasn't that hungry. So I ordered a glass of wine, a small plate of crudo, and 2 (yup) Gulf prawns. The waitress was somewhat dubious of my order, asking, \"have you been here before?\" I answered yes, but should have added that we are in fact some of your original customers from the Bush Street glory days. The kind that used to be on your email list for your beer tasting dinner menu, i.e. LOYAL.\n\nShe put the order in, then the chef at the raw bar -- where we were sitting -- got the ticket and started to make a stink, something to the effect of \"who eff orders 2 prawns??\" Um, I do -- the customer sitting RIGHT in front of you. If I wanted judgment with my dinner, I would save myself some money, go back home and eat with my parents.\n\nI would call the incident a fluke except for the fact that during our previous visit, we had gone to dinner to celebrate and ordered some crudo, the chowder, and a small seafood platter. I had intended to order the cheese plate for dessert, but the waitress had already closed the ticket. I'm either not eating enough, or eating too much depending on their mood.\n\nThe chowder was delicious as usual, but the front of the house attitude and poor service really spoiled what used to be a special spot for us. Seriously, if you want to criticize your customer's ordering habits, talk about it on your break, or don't offer an \u00e0 la carte menu.\n\nI didn't want to write this review, but my hope is that the owners (and other SF restaurateurs) will realize there is a contingent of diners in the city who are getting consistently disappointed by the attitude and lack of service in San Francisco.

Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after.

Delicious and good amount of fresh! fish vs. potato filler.\n\n$5 Clams - Marinated in white wine broth...possibly my 2nd favorite next to the oysters.\n\n$10 Fish tacos (2) - Crazy good value for 2 lightly battered fresh cod and the works...1st time around these were a bit larger but still good on corn tortillas. \n\n$5 wine + beer - both went down way too easy.\n\nOff the happy hour menu\n\nCrudo platter - a must.

Toronado, of course, has $1 off draft beers from opening until 6 p.m. At Lucky 13 in San Francisco, you can drink fresh Pliny the Elder, Dogfish Head 90, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Anchor Liberty and many more for $3 a pint from opening until 8:30 p.m. Most other beer bars offer some variation of a happy hour from around 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. or so. (Don't forget to tip $1 per beer.)\nBut one of the best happy hours in the city isn't even at a beer bar; it's at Bar Crudo on Divisadero. Bar Crudo's selection of some four-dozen bottled beers, along with a handful of well-chosen taps, would put many so-called beer bars to shame. But what sets Bar Crudo apart is its happy hour food. Usually, happy hour in a bar means a few munchies, Buffalo wings, or something deep-fried and virtually unrecognizable. At Bar Crudo, a lot of the food never goes near a flame, let alone a deep fryer. Bar Crudo, as its name implies, specializes in raw dishes, mostly seafood -- six types of fresh oysters; five types of clams; and small plates of raw arctic char, butterfish, Tomba tuna, Hokkaido scallops, spicy yellowfin tuna and Hawaiian ono -- as well as steak crudo and several other \"cold\" preparations. You can also order cooked seafood, as well as delicious seafood chowder, brimming with large chunks of fish, and fish tacos ($5 at happy hour). \nWhile other restaurants conceal frozen fish under deep frying batter or buttery sauces, at Bar Crudo there's no place to hide. Preparation is subtle and minimal, allowing the fish to be the star of the show.  \nThe lineup of five draft beers matches well with the food: Moonlight Brewing Reality Czech ($3 a pint during a happy hour recently), Allagash White Belgian-style wit beer (which adds some spritzy, subtly lemony zest to the oysters and raw seafood), Firestone Walker Solace, Russian River IPA and the 30th anniversary stout from Sierra Nevada and Anchor Brewing. (When you see Russian River and Moonlight on tap, it's a good sign; those brewers, who distribute their kegs themselves from Santa Rosa, love showcasing their beer with great food, and they're very selective.) \nThe extensive list of nearly 50 bottles is also carefully crafted to complement the fresh seafood, from Hitachino Nest White Ale and Bavik Pils to Ommegang Ale, Gouden Carolus and Duchesse de Bourgogne Flanders red ale (for those with a sour tooth). Wines are well-matched as well, with some sparklers like German Gilabert Cava Brut and whites and reds from France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Chile, Argentina and Napa. \nBar Crudo moved to what is now known as NOPA (north of the Panhandle) last year from its original location above the Stockton Street tunnel. The highlight of the new restaurant is clearly the fish itself, along with the people who deftly prepare it. There aren't any TVs, but that's OK when you can watch gifted chefs work their magic live and in real time. \nBar Crudo is taking California cuisine to a new level, showing the culinary world what can be accomplished with simple, fresh ingredients matched with great beer like Allagash White and Moonlight Reality Czech poured fresh from a tap. The overall experience is sublime, and when you can have half a dozen fresh oysters, a delicious cup of fish chowder or fish tacos and two excellent pilsners for less than $20, it's almost irresistible.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-06-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered a dozen of the Point Reyes oysters and the happy hour size seafood chowder.

Very fresh, good, but it didn't quite sing.  It needed something else to tie it together subtlely.... a touch of grapefruit salt?  Balsamic reduction?  A couple of flakes of red pepper?

It was cozy, but you still had room to have private conversation. We couldn't help but look over at the couple across from us who were like the dining dead they describe in Eternal Sunshine. Both were texting or checking email on their iphones instead of talking to each other... how sad.\n\nThe crudo sampler started with the scallop with micro greens and what was very much like a chickpea puree. The flavors with subtle and the textures were perfect together. After that they recommended we try the tombo tuna with lemongrass and siracha. That was probably one of the most delicious pieces of fish I've had in a while. It was extremely fresh and none of the flavors overtook the dish (which is difficult with siracha).\n\nThey followed this with a kampachi with hazlenuts and pears. It was sweet and salty at the same time, acting as a perfect following to the tuna. Finally we ended with the arctic char, which had horseradish and wasabi tobiako. It was one of the freshest pieces of fish I've had in a long time and the spice of real wasabi was also not overpowering. \n\nWe continued with the lobster, beet and burrata salad with watercress. Dear god please get that salad. It had giant pieces of lobster and they served golden beets with it. Everything was so fresh and the flavors were absolutely perfect together. This came with a very large bowl of mussels simmered in a Belgian beer sauce with scallions and bratwurst. This dish went splendidly with my pint of Rocket Red ale. The mussels were very large, very fresh and came in a huge portion.\n\nWe ended with a cup of the seafood chowder and that was the only thing neither of us were crazy about.

The food was completely on point.  \n\nWe started with a couple of oyster samplers, which was really fun.  Usually when I get a plate of oysters, I can't tell much of a difference, but this was totally different.  Most of our table enjoyed the Kusshi's the most because they were so silky smooth.  \n\nThen, we ordered a bunch of the raw dishes.  We got the Kona Kampachi, which was my personal favorite.  I loved the pairing with peaches, and the avocado mousse went nicely with everything to tie it together.  We also got the butterfish, scallops, and the fluke.  All of the flavors were totally different, which made everything seem like a great tasting menu. \n\nWe got the lobster tomato salad with burrata, which was so delicious.  To be fair though, I love anything with burrata.  We also got the whole dungeness crab.  Here's where I think the service could have been a little bit better.  First of all, we got crab crackers to help us get the meat out, but it would have been really great if we also got a crab pick/scoop.  Using our regular fork was a little too unwieldy.  Plus, the busboy took away the butter before the whole table was done eating, so we requested more, but it took a little bit of time.  Also, at the end of the crab, it would have been really nice to get some wipes or a finger bowl to clean our hands.  I mean, c'mon, we just ate a whole crab with our hands.  We did end up getting bread, but only after we asked for it after seeing it on other tables.  \n\nFinally, we got to the hot portion of the meal:  devil prawns, scallops in coconut curry sauce, and the seafood chowder.  Due to the bacon flavor and overall depth of the chowder sauce, I believe I told the table if I spilled some of the broth on my arm, I would most likely go Donner party on myself. \n\nOverall, since we were eating some great quality seafood, and our table went a little crazy with the booze, I knew the bill would be on the more expensive side.  I have to say I felt like this restaurant totally deserved it though, because the food we had really was quite commendable.  I am not the type of person who eats a ton of fish outside of sushi, and the variety and interesting mix of flavors on this menu were able to keep me totally engaged throughout.  \n\nMy one last comment on this place though was they didn't have anything to offer for dessert, which was disappointing.

Light and refreshing. \n\nI only had three disappointments: \n\n1) The Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Cubes ($12 for 4 pieces).

My group of four ordered the following:\n\nLarge Seafood platter\nCrudo Platter\nSeafood Chowder\nBottle of Verdejo\n\nThe seafood platter was fresh and tasty, however, nothing to go ranting and raving to everyone about.  If you have fresh shellfish, you can never be disappointed.  The sauces that came with it were average: clarified butter, a mignonette, and cocktail sauce.\n\nThe Crudo Platter was where I was extremely disappointed.  I love raw fish.  I'm satisfied with  a bit of wasabi and soy sauce that highlights, not extinguishes a fish's flavor.  At Bar Crudo though, the chef douses each slice of fish in so much overwhelming flavor that you taste nothing but lemon zest, wasabi or vanilla salt.  This portion of the dinner was what I was most looking forward to, and because it was so disappointing, it overwhelmed the entire dining experience.\n\nThe Seafood Chowder was the best thing we ate.  It was very heavy, what with the bacon and cream broth.  The seafood in it was cooked perfectly, including the squid and octopus.  If I were to return to Bar Crudo, the Seafood Chowder would be the only thing I'd order again.\n\nTotal price came to about $240.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-04-26"}, {"excerpts": ["their seafood chowder is the best item on their menu."], "author": "Stacey H.", "review": "i love their happy hours. their seafood chowder is the best item on their menu.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The best dish was surprisingly the Seafood Chowder.

But everything was just ok. The biggest disappointment was the salmon in the Arctic Char. Salmon is supposed to have tons of flavor and be so buttery it melts in your mouth! But this was not the case at all. The salmon was SO bland and I was very disappointed. And since I don't really care for horseradish, I took half a bite with and without. The second bite I placed some of the wasabi tobiko on the salmon, but the tobiko was too wasabi flavored. I honestly did not see what the big deal about this platter and at $24 for 8 pieces, I would probably pass.\n\nThe Seared Hokkaido Scallop dish was ok. Nothing great or bad about the dish. It tastes like something I've had before though, but the microgreens overpowered the taste of the whole dish so if you get this, you might want to opt out of eating those.\n\nThe best dish was surprisingly the Seafood Chowder. It was really flavorful and the seafood in it was cooked perfectly! Especially the yummy mussels.

I'm glad I did because this is a place where one could have the \"menu problem\" or not know what or how much to order. I used to work at a tapas place in Thailand, and we always had people confused with the concept. Our plates were tiny and usually about 5-7 bites. People would not understand, so they'd order one dish thinking that each was an entree. A typical conversation with a customer at Papa's Tapas would go something like this:\n\nCustomer: \"I'd like the chicken wrapped in banana leaves.\"\nMe: \"Well, sir, all of our dishes are small plates. Depending upon your level of hunger, a party of 2 such as yourselves should order between 6-8 dishes.\"\nCustomer: \"Well, we're not all that hungry, so we'll also have the asparagus.\"\nMe: \"Yes, sir, like I said, two dishes will get you and your wife started but it will by no means fill you up.\"\nCustomer: \"We plan to have dessert as well.\"\nMe: *walks away shaking head*\n\nAnyway, back to Bar Crudo. I had a few truly memorable dishes that night, and although shellfish usually aren't really my bag, I did enjoy the oysters. The best dishes that I would definitely go back for were the Arctic Char, the Tombo Tuna, the San Sebastien, and the piece de resistance, the lick-the-sides-of-the-bowl-deliciously-good-and-yummy Seafood Chowder. There's bits of bacon in it! I was that customer who was being annoying and banging her spoon as she scraped it along the side of the bowl to get all the remaining bits. \n\nMy only complaint would be that it's small, and if you go late enough, and sit near the east side of the restaurant, you can hear the (questionable) music coming from Tunnel Top bar next door.

My friend and I have been thinking about coming here for months and finally we got around to it.  So we came here last Thursday and had 8:30 reservations.....I didn't seated until 10pm.  (Note:This is not a place for more than a party of 2...max is 4).  We had a party of 3 and they only had 2 tables that would accomodate us...the party before us had paid their bill and sat there for early and hour and a half just talking.  Now if I wasn't so hungry...I definitely wouldn't have minded.  They are located right next to Tunnel Top....great pomegrate comos.  I had 2 of these while waiting for my table and ended up really buzzed.  \n\nOk so when we finally got seated I ordered the Crudo sampler which consist of Artic Char, Fluke, Scallop and Tombo Tuna. I asolutely loved it....very delicious.  I was surprised I ate the scallop...normally I am not too big on it but it was very sweet.  I also had the yellow tail....which I was not impressed....the seasalt....was too salty for me.  Next I had the dayboat scallop trio....and omg was that delish.  Served on a bed of potato and fennel puree....I was just on a roll with the scallops that night..  \n\nOk so here is the best part...well close enough to it.  Because I waited so long for my table...they gave us the lobster and beet salad on the house.  Those have got to be the sweetest tomatoes ever.  The lobster, beet and tomato together went very well.  Also they gave us seafood chowder on the house.  I really liked it..especially since it had applewood bacon in it...smelled and tasted great.  \n\nOverall I will come back....next time party of 2.  Also, I was a bit disappointed that they ran out of things that I wanted to try but it gives us a reason to come back.  There is also an awesome staff here.

I was a little buzzed and checking out everybody's food, so I didn't mind too much. We were seated in the small mezzanine area upstairs and then tackled the menu.\n\nBar Crudo isn't cheap, nor should it be. I mean this is raw seafood after all.

The entire table was alarmed by the overpowering pineapple vanilla vinaigrette that topped the tombo tuna.  Pristine fresh fish should not be drowned out by such strong flavors. When the manfriend tasted it first and remarked, \"This tastes like Lifesavers,\" I thought he was more buzzed than I had realized. Upon trying the tombo tuna myself, I could not believe the uncanny resemblance to pineapple lifesavers!\n\nThe crudos were all stunning to look at; each plated with tiny microgreens, light sprinklings of exotic ingredients, and bright splashes of sauces for color. Except for the pineapple misstep, the others were very much enjoyed. The lobster salad was also a posh treat. The grad student salary does not allow for frequent lobster consumption these days. It was even more enjoyable to have plump juicy chunks of lobster primed for my consumption without having to decorticate it myself. \n\nThe seafood chowder was everything I hoped for and very richly garnered all the prior praise from others' reviews.

I would easily enjoy 2x the portion here.\n\n* Rhode Island Fluke - Loved the sweet beets against the salty cavier.  Gave the somewhat bland fish some life.  Rather disappointed the horseradish did not have a stronger kick to it.  \n\n* Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Cubes - Like a high class Hawaiian Poke!  I would have enjoyed a bit more spice, but I can see it taking away from the high quality, deep red tuna.  Green onions added a wonderful compliment.\n\n* Tombo Tuna - Quite refreshing!  This part of the review will be lacking as it wasn't a very memorable sample.\n\nWe went surf 'n turf here and also got the Steak Crudo, a series of semi-raw steak topped with various tastes.  The poached egg should be popped so the meat could marinate in the yolk.  This is a classic tartare or steak and eggs froofy younger brother.  I loved the simplicity of the pipparas and beef... spicy sweet with fatty beef.  These tastes are made for each other.  All this served with toasted crutons to cut the richness.  And you know the bits of peppercress aren't just good garnish, they should be eaten with the beef and fish.  Think of it as a tiny salad.  \n\nA thoroughly great experience here.

Determined to try all restaurants that have made the cut, I've been to 31 so far.  But, the experience has not felt complete... something is missing.  My mid-year resolution: add a final Yelp step to the process.  Bar Crudo is my first.\n\nI was solo tonight, and lucky me there was a single seat at the bar which was not reserved.  I love sitting at an oyster or sushi bar, right in the middle of the action, and I like it even more if the people behind the bar serve booze.  As I people-watched, I noticed that I seemed to be the only person without a reservation, which was a surprise to me considering it was a Monday night at 6 pm.  I bet this place gets crudo crazy later in the week.\n\nThe wine list was fairly unimpressive, although the beer selection was crudonculous.  I opted for the only Pinot (Noir in this review and all others) on the menu, which came in a bottle that had a cap instead of a cork.  I'll never get used to that; I don't care how \"green\" it is.\n\nI decided to start with the Crudo sampler appetizer.  I'm pretty sure that I was the first person who put an order in for the evening, however, the wait time was way too long.  Maybe not that long in crudo minutes, but certainly long in normal appetizer minutes.  It's ok though, because while I am waiting, I get to witness the spectrum of skill level in oyster shucking.  First guy, coulda done it blindfolded.  Second guy, I coulda used a blindfold, as I was certain this guy would slice his finger off before the dozenth oyster was open.\n\nI understood the wait time when the sampler arrived.  There were four kinds of crudo, each more delicate and intricate than the previous.  The one I was really excited about trying was the Hawaiian Ono, which had lemongrass, citrus, mint, chili, tobiko, and more on it.  I LOVE all of those things.  Did I love all those things together?  Not so much.  I expected some sort of crazy crudo chemical reaction in my mouth, which didn't happen.  Instead, it just tasted like a bunch of random ingredients thrown together for an experiment.  Very disappointing.  Thank goodness for the second crudo - the arctic char, which had just a few logical ingredients and was heaven.  In my industry, I'd recommend the KISS technique to the Crudoians.... Keep It Simple, Stupid; sometimes less is more.\n\nIt was cold outside, and there were only a couple of hot dishes on the menu.  I opted for a small seafood chowder, which was surprisingly large.  The first bite was beautiful, and I decided Bauer was onto something.  After the third bite, however, I was certain that I could replicate the chowder at home with a pint of cream and a few sticks of butter.  The chowder was so rich, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens (unless I'm on a first date.)\n\nLet me close with what I'd tell MB if he was interested in my Crudopinion:  Bauer, they're on to you.  They know who you are, and/or they know when you are coming.  I bet they have some \"special\" they offer you that is not on the menu when you're there, am I right?  There was no special for me tonight.  This place was good, but I'm not sure it was Top 100 good.

We started with the oysters and the crudo sampler, moved on to the cold dishes (Lobster Salad and San Sebastian) and finally the hot dishes (Seafood chowder, the scallops and the trout.)\n\nCrudo - My favorite was the arctic char.  Very buttery and went well with the horseradish dressing.  The scallop and the butterfish were also very good. The salt on the scallop really helped bring out the flavor.  The kampachi was decent but I didn't eating the lime skin with the fish.  \n\nLobster Salad - Mirroring most of the other yelp reviews, the mixture between the lobster and the burratta was perfect.  I could have just had this dish for the whole meal.  \n\nSan Sebastian - The dressing they used worked really well with the tuna.  Kind of a vinegrette taste but very light.  The manchego and the broche went well with the fish as well.  The fish was a little dry but still had good flavors.  \n\nSeafood Chowder - Verrrrry rich!  I believe this is a chowder that needs to be shared.  After a few spoonfuls it becomes too much.  The seafood inside was cooked well though.  A lot of times seafood is overcooked in soups and is very dry but this chowder seemed to maintain the moisture very well.  \n\nScallops - The spicy sauce added a nice kick and really brought the flavors out.  I would have liked the scallops to be cooked a little less as I thought they were a bit overcooked but the flavors were still excellent.  \n\nTrout - We were initially not going to order this but our waitress highly recommended it.  I have never had trout that was so good before.  Very tender and very moist this dish could have been the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe service was decent.  The food came out a little slow but that wasn't such a big deal.  The place itself is a bit noisy and next time I will consider bringing ear plugs.

Not necessarily a \"fancy\" place, it can go either way, and I would say fantastic for dates without being cheesy. It's cool. The food is delicious. There were two of us. We ordered 6 oysters (3 varieties though they had 6 or 7) and 6 shrimp to start and served with lemons, a mignonette and cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish. And we liked the ninigret oysters the best so we ordered half a dozen more! \n\nNext came the bar crudo sampler, two pieces of four varieties of fish, all raw. (We had Arctic Char, Fluke, Scallop and tombo tuna served with watermelon radish.) Then we also had the Yellowfin Tuna cubes in a sesame soy dressing. Not spectacular, but the fish was very good and fresh! Lastly, we had the seafood chowder to share, and that was a perfect end to the light meal. Shrimp, calamari, fish, mussel, smoked fish prepared in a buttery cream soup. No dessert.\n\nIt was delicious, but expensive. Very good when you want to splurge! Good alternative to sushi.

The ambience didn't grab me at first but grew on me during the course of the night. Was that linked to wine consumption? Hard to say.\n\nWe ordered a lovely 2005 Pouilly Fume ($42) to kick things off, which struck the right balance between minerality and fruit, making it a useful pairing with our food. There were less expensive wines on the menu - but remember, I was feeling sorry for myself.\n\nWe launched into the meal with a couple of crudo plates (raw fish). The restaurant takes pride in layering unusual flavors in its dishes, so while I'm a perennial sucker for spicy yellowfin tuna, I succumbed to our waiter's pitch on trying some of the more adventurous, less standard concoctions.\n\nFirst up was the Tombo Tuna ($12 for four pieces), complemented with lobster oil, pineapple vanilla vinaigrette, chervil, Himalayan pepper. The vanilla was quite potent but other than that, this one came across a little bland and lacking in flavor - not a wholly successful ensemble. \n\nThe Hawaiian Ono, on the other hand, was quite delectable. The fish was beautifully presented, melt-in-the-mouth and matched up with lemongrass, citrus, chili, daikon sprout, enoki mushroom, mint, cilantro, and yuzu tobiko. The citrus gave a nice zing to the dish, the tobiko popped in the mouth and the chili provided a welcome bite ($12 for 4 pieces).\n\nFor the main event, Joel went with the seafood chowder ($13). Honestly, I'm not a huge chowder fan but I had to send the waiter away, twice, while I ended up practically finishing the bowl. The addictive ingredient that made me want this chowder over others? Probably the applewood smoked bacon. Bacon makes everything better. \n\nMeanwhile, I opted for the lobster salad ($15) featuring pistachio oil,  chiogga beets and some soft sliced mozzarella-like cheese, among other goodies I'm sure. This was also a successful combo - the oil was used sparingly enough that it didn't overwhelm, the lobster chunks were succulent, the cheese provided a dreamy backdrop, and beets generally make me happy, particularly when presented in two colors.\n \nBy the end of our meal, our tastebuds felt duly treated and we were definitely feeling better about life.

We sat at 5 and didn't revceive any food until 550 pm.  My bf and constantly checked the time.  We were here for over 2 hours.  Thats ridiculously slow for a raw bar.  When handing us the check they took 10% off because they knew how slow the service was.  I thought that was nice, but really not worth the 10%.

We sat at a wonderful table close to the window. (This is the same table I had the last time I came).\n\nWe started with the full crab ($26). This seemed like a deal. You got 8 HUGE legs. Its always a fun experience with friends sharing, opening and eating the crab. We all agreed that the cocktail sauce was the best we'd had (and I am not really one to be picky about cocktail sauce). The crab also came with melted butter. I highly recommend anything that comes with it. The previous time I came, I also had crab, but, I don't remember it being this large. We might have come at an excellent crab time.\n\nIn addition, I had the Tuna Confit ($14) which came with toasted bread, roasted red peppers, green olives, asparagus and half a soft boiled egg. Getting a bit with the full combo was spectacular (but, difficult because the toast was so thick). My husband had the lobster and beet salad ($17). He enjoyed it, but, didn't like that he wasn't quite sure what some of white sticky stuff was on it. It looked to me like an uncooked egg white (but, who knows, we didn't ask).\n\nFor our last course, three of us had a cup of the seafood chowder. I was already pretty full, but, I remembered this from my last trip to Bar Crudo. It was delicious (best in the city), as usual. Somehow, I think I ate too much to fully appreciate it. By the way, the soup comes with chunks of fish, clam (out of the shell), potatoes, calamari, bacon and lots of cream. \n\nService was really nice.

(In fact, it made me register on Yelp so I can write this; I do look forward to writing about more dining experiences).\n\nThanks to Yelp, we intentionally came here to see what the hype was all about, and low and behold we became believers ourselves.  We sat at the bar because there was no seating upstairs; the kitchen is wondrously tiny.  The service and atmosphere was warm and friendly - totally a local bar kind of feel with a touch of unique taste.  The food, however, was equivalent to a five-star gourmet dress-up-dinner type of establishment.  It was shockingly good.  \n\nWe ordered the Crudo Seafood Sampler, Lobster Salad, Seafood Chowder and the Gazpacho.  The Crudo sampler had bite-sized tastings of the Rhode Island Fluke (see Web site for details), Artic Char, Dayboat Scallops (raw and loved the fresh taste) and Tombo Tuna.  Each bite was heaven, and we joked about how this place could easily be the back kitchen of a French or Italian fusion joint and charge $100/head for tastings because it was that good.  The Chowder was a wonder of taste, because none of the seafood was overcooked.  The calamari was still soft and my teeth could sink effortlessly into the succulent soft meat.  Normally, I do not prefer to have fish in my seafoood chowder, but here, the small bits of fish were, ironically, not fishy but soft and flakey.  The red potatoes were not overcooked to the point where it thickened the sauce; no, each wedge had its sharp corners still intact.  The Lobster Salad was another heavenly dish, because, ironically, even without the fresh succulent melt-in-your-mouth lobster, the heirloom tomatoes and the rich burrata cheese doused with the caper vinaigrette was truly flavorful.  \n\nIncluding the two beers, our bill was about $80 before tip.  Cheerio.  We are definitely going again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-09-22"}, {"excerpts": ["The seafood chowder we shared was good too.  ", "He said it was the best calamari in chowder ever!

But when we got upstairs after a very long \"10 minutes,\" there were about 3 completely ready-to-serve tables waiting.  I was baffled, why make us wait downstairs when there are clearly available tables upstairs?\n\nBut my attention quickly shifted to the warm, charming decor: it's a simple room with romantic lighting.  The metal tables reminded me of Cafe Maritime (seems like the chef used to work there according to reviews I read here).   Our waitress was sweet and warm as well.  \n\nThe maitre d' who had us wait downstairs was interesting to observe.  He'd come up every two minutes to adjust the position of the chair next to us ever so slightly.  I suppose a perfectionist?  Maybe a nervous compulsive thing?  Unfortunately when that table was filled, he couldn't adjust the chair anymore.  So instead, he'd come upstairs, walk around it, and then go downstairs.  \n\nAlright, the food: oysters were delicious!  I don't know if anyone ever remembers the names of oysters they eat, especially when they come in a variety.  I sure don't. The crudo sampler reminded me of the sashimi three-way at Michael Mina.  Very pretty presentation, but slightly strong for my taste.  I couldn't really taste the fish themselves.  I didn't really touch my boyfriend's steak crudo, but it looked good and he claimed it to be good.  The seafood chowder we shared was good too.  He said it was the best calamari in chowder ever!  Very tender. \n\nI almost ordered another crudo dish just because it seemed like we didn't' order enough to eat.  But by the time I finished the chowder, I was completely full for some reason.

We could have gone somewhere else, but prior to coming to Bar Crudo, i had read endless reviews on yelp and came in with *high high* expectations, and it seriously made me want to give it a try, and i swear, i was willing to wait the extra 30 minutes.\n \nI wouldn't really say this is a suitable place for a date... \nthe upstairs :  seemed rather claustrophobic, and the bottom level, well, primarily a bar area with a bunch of bar stools, can I just tell you how uncomfortable those bar stools were? In fact, I had to stand up a few times, and it was actually MORE COMFORTABLE to stand up, but what a waste to enjoy an evening, and not only that, there were people walking back and forth, including the server, because either they had to use the restroom or they were going upstairs, in other words, very chaotic, so you can't even sit comfortable.\n\nKinda has this California Wine Merchant feel (i'll write my CWM review tomorrow)... the structure of the bottom level that is...It even has this window seating area, and draws you into the back...

"], "author": "David G.", "review": "Good things often come in small packages. I'm not sure if that's the case, but when speaking of Bar Crudo, it's right on the money. Opened in November 2005, by twin brothers Mike (the chef) and Tim (the house manager) Selvera, Bar Crudo has taken the raw-bar food craze to a new level. Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane. As the evening was rather chilly on my first visit, I tried the marvelously rich seafood chowder with lots of fresh clams, fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, red potatoes, and smoky applewood smoked bacon ($10). Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster. The crudo (raw fish) is the main focus of the menu and includes gloriously spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha, and green onions ($12); Rhode Island black bass with hard quail egg, habanero tobiko and blood orange reduction ($9); and not-to-be-missed arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill ($10). In case you don't like seafood, try the artisan cheese plate with flower honey, seasonal fruit, medjool dates, and nutty walnut bread ($11) and the sherry duck liver mousse with green pepper corns, cornichons and grilled bread. Their rich flavors and tempting texture blend nicely together.  And if you're indecisive about what to have for dessert, don't worry. There's only one item available on the menu, decadent XOX truffles ($6) that were definitely worth the wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to dine alone, or perhaps with your friends or someone special, Bar Crudo's delicious seafood and quaint atmosphere are definitely a winning combination.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["the 2 good hot plates were the manila clams with chorizo and the seafood chowder, both strong bold flavors.\n"], "author": "Rob C.", "review": "very small -- or cozy as most would describe it\nraw bar, offerings prevent vegetarians from eating here\n\non the grand scheme of things, I place sashimi over tiradito over crudo over ceviche.  thus only tried one cold plate -- the crudo sampler (2 pieces each) of artic, butterfish, tuna, scallop.  the only 2 I really liked were the butterfish with jamon serrano and the tuna with pear -- got the sweet/salty combo going.  the other two were uninspired.\n\nthe 2 good hot plates were the manila clams with chorizo and the seafood chowder, both strong bold flavors.\nthe third hot plate, hamachi collar was cooked perfectly, garnished ok\n\nthis place takes a very long time to serve (several hours)\nthey almost ran out of bread -- a must for dipping in the chowder", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-26"}, {"excerpts": ["best seafood chowder ", "i've ever had.

We ordered a bottle of champagne and they didn't offer to put it on ice for us.  They just sat it on the table.  Just say NO to warm champagne my friends, that is just wrong.  And, when I asked our server for a bucket of ice, I felt like he thought I was being high maintenance when in fact he should have automatically put it on ice for us.  That's a no brainer in my book.  And, I noticed that another table had ordered champagne which had been placed on the table-no ice.  So, that was even more reason for me to mention it in my review-they need to alter their champagne chilling policy.\n4.  Although all the food was delicious, they brought everything out at once and didn't space the food at all.  They brought 4 dishes out at once which completely crowded the table and made me feel like they were rushing us.\n\nBut, the food was fab so I'm going to give them 3.5 stars.  The seafood chowder was amazing.  And, the lobster burrata salad is SO GOOD. \n\n I will be back, but if I experience bad service again I'll probably opt for other seafood restos in the future.

A member of our party ordered the half Maine lobster, which arrived with half of the tail, half of the carapace, and no claws (obviously a part of all Maine lobsters) at all. Being from Maine and growing up eating Maine lobster, I told our waitress that either they were advertising and charging for Maine lobster and fraudulently serving inferior Pacific lobster, or perhaps else someone was funneling lobster claws off to a side purpose (the lobster salad?) - but either way, since they advertised Maine lobster and were charging for it, they should provide us the 1 claw.  Our waitress said she checked with the executive chefs and told us they said that the 1 1/4 lb lobsters are just \"running small\" and that there was no mistake.  While 1 1/4 lb is absolutely the ideal size for a Maine lobster, there's no such thing as a healthy Maine lobster without claws.\n\nI told her that their story was untrue, and she left us for a bit.  We then saw her huddling with a bunch of people who worked there, and she eventually came back to us saying oops - the chefs said that we actually received a \"deformed lobster\" and she wouldn't charge us for it.

I've ordered cups every time I had been there before, and last night I knew I needed the full bowl. I told my boyfriend that he could try some, because it was sooooo good! He ended up finishing less than half of the bowl in addition to his Hamachi, and described the chowder as \"the best thing I've ever had.\" The chorizo in it makes a difference, and you're also getting huge chunks of all different sorts of fish so it's very hearty and filling - and not too creamy.
