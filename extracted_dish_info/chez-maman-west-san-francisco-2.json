So when I tell you that Chez Maman West feels a bit like San Francisco past, that's a compliment.  \n\nChez Maman West occupies a buzzy spot in Hayes Valley.  I've dined here a few times and tried to dine more than that but have been put off by the wait.  They do quite a business, turning many tables in a day.  This is generally not a place at which you can linger.   \n\nThe old-school feelings this place evokes arise from many avenues.  First, there's the space itself.  It's intimate but not fancy or cutting edge.  It's a busy bistro, like one might find in Paris, and it's not glammed up.  It's very comfortable and even solo diners should fit right in, taking a seat at the small bar.  \n\nThe menu itself is a throwback to simpler times.  Chez Maman West seems to be one of the few remaining places where you can put together a very filling meal for around $20 (before wine).  A basket containing sliced baguette and butter arrives on your table without you requesting it and their wine list features many by-the-glass reds, priced at only $8.    \n\nWhile I usually opt for the excellent moules (mussels, $16) and a side of perfect frites (thin, salty, glorious french fries, $6) I ordered the Salade Nicoise ($16, with ahi or salmon; I chose ahi) on a recent visit and found it to be hugely satisfying.  This is a full-meal salad despite the fact that I also ordered the don't-miss frites to share.  \n\nA Smoked Salmon Panini ($12, with salad accompaniment) was reported equally satisfying and, between the table bread, the frites, and the wine, half the Panini was taken home for a second meal.  That's something one rarely reports in the \"new\" San Francisco.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to eat good, well-priced, ample-portioned food while you bitch about Trump, Chez Maman West fits the bill.  Your second topic of choice may, however, crawl to the back-burner as you realize that there's still a few places out there that are keeping the SF of old alive.  \n\nI like Chez Maman West.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-14"}, {"excerpts": ["SMOKED SALMON PANINI: ", "Herbs, creme fraiche, capers, and caramelized onions.

The outside patio is usable if you sit on the inside edge because of their large heat lamps but you sit on the further side, you will likely be uncomfortable when the wind hits. With its prime location on Hayes St right in the heart of Hayes Valley, this place is consistently packed so this scenario where outside seating is open but the inside is packed is encountered more than you would expect.\n\nConclusions: Chez Maman does mostly everything right and it wasn't so cramped inside, the burger wasn't $16, and some of their main dishes had some unique twists, it would hands down get 5-stars from me.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-08-09"}, {"excerpts": ["However, the veal and striped bass my friends ordered were cooked very well.

Service was prompt and the staff was nice to accommodate our schedule.\n\n***Food***\nThe meal started with complimentary bread and butter, the bread was pretty good and we ask for more to have with the escargot butter, garlic, herb sauce, and for the broth produced from cooking the mussels. Still water was provided along with a wine drinks menu.\n~Escargot de Bourgogne\nEscargot has very good flavor, buttery, garlicky, and a lot of parsley flavor. They were not over cooked and chewy, not under cooked and slimy. Unfortunately they removed all the organs so it was quite small, when left with only the foot and body.\n~Beef Tartare\nBeef was sliced to about a 3-5 mm size cubes, making it easy to eat. I didn't get any sinew in my pieces and the quail egg yolk on top brought a good creaminess and also acted as a sort of binder. Dijon mustard brought a good heat to the dish, capers added a little salt, with the shallots adding some texture. Bread was nicely toasted and acted as a good platform for the beef. It needed small a pinch of salt to better bring out the flavor and a crack or two of black pepper for seasoning.\n~Chez Maman Mac and Cheese\nSlightly disappointing because the group was looking forward to the shaved truffles as seen on the menu online and by the door. We was served good mac and cheese with truffle oil, which isn't the same, nor an ingredient I would use in my cooking.\n~Les Moules - Provencale\nMussels was seasoned and cooked very well with the beard removed and no grit in the cream and mussel liquoer.\n~Veal\nVeal ever so slightly over cooked, but when paired with the sauce it was perfectly fine. Vegetables was cooked well, with zucchini and yellow squash no over good, and the carrots had a good texture.\n\n***Greeter, staff, wait***\nThe greeter was nice and showed us a menu as we waited. She occasionally came by to update us on the wait. We waited for about 30 minutes for a table, where two ladies was taking their time and idling for 3 hours was what we was informed by the hostess.

There are no foams, gels or molecular gastronomy at CMW. Their concept is to serve food your mother used to make ... if your mother was French and ran a bistro. However, I think this food must have been ubiquitous in every American gentleman's club, restaurant  or country club in the 60's and 70's. This isn't groundbreaking, gourmet or chi chi food. This is classic French comfort food done well. \n\nWe were a group of 3 for dinner last night. We added our names to the list at around 5:39 pm. A group of 5 before us said they had been waiting for 2 hours. No reservations are taken. We were a little hesitant as the hostess said the wait would be at least an hour. We were pleasantly surprised when we snagged an inside table just 30 minutes later. Space is tight so be prepared to suck in that spare tire and apologize for bumping into other guests as you squeeze into your table.\n\nWe started with Escargot de Bourgogne. Six snails are cooked in their shell with parsley, butter and white wine. The snails were tiny and I felt they were just a vehicle for the sauce. I always try to obey my beloved grandmother who always told me to not leave food on my plate. Therefore, each of us had to request a whole basket of bread to sop up all that saucy goodness, delicious carb overload. Expect garlic breath. On hindsight, probably not the best thing to eat just before going to the Orpheum for a show. To the stranger seated to my right, I apologize for any unintended aromatic vapors I sent your way. \n\nOne friend ordered the lamb and vegetable brochettes. Two skewers were served with couscous and a pesto mint coulis. The lamb was tender but I think this dish had more veggie than lamb. This was the most expensive dish of the 3 entrees but delivered less bang for the buck. Another friend ordered the Veal with a creamy white wine sauce and mushrooms. The sauce was rich and the veal was tender. \n\nIf my own dish wasn't so hearty, I would have begged for a bigger taste of her meal. I ordered the pork chop with brussel sprouts and an apple cider mustard sauce. The pork chop was good but I think the sprouts and the sauce stole the show. The sprouts were roasted with bacon. Coupled with some of the sauce and it was a perfectly salty, sweet bite of heaven. \n\nFor dessert, we all shared a crepe Suzette and a crepe tatin. The Suzette was stuffed with orange butter, sprinkled with sugar and doused with Grand Marnier. Our server fired the dessert but the flames didn't last long. It was still quite boozy when we ate it. The crepe tatin was a bit disappointing. The filling was cold and reminded me of apple pie filling. Since we were expecting hot, caramelized apples, it was just OK. It may have been our fault since we told our server that we needed to finish dinner in time to get to the theater. \n\nMy friends and I enjoyed a perfect night where the stars all aligned to give us a fun evening of good food, great camaraderie and a pair of Kinky Boots.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-12-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Crepe Tatin and Chocolate Fondant were pretty great too."], "author": "Ben H.", "review": "The Grilled Salmon blew my mind.

The dijon offered a great sharp kick to the beef, and the tiny quail egg gave a sophisticated feel to the palate. \n\nLes Moules Provencale with a side of french fries: These mussels were light, elegant and seasoned just right. There was no overwhelming fishy ocean flavor, rather a big bucket full of juicy goodness.\n\nGrilled Salmon: Took the cake as our favorite savory dish of the night.
