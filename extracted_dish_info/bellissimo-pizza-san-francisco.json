While visiting my favorite city we stayed at the Hotel Vertigo and were looking for a pizza place nearby because we were lazy, had the munchies, and wanted to eat in. All the reviews for pizza joints in the area were pretty bad so we decided to take a chance on Bellissimo.\n\nWhile the guy who took the order was not very personable and had a thick, non-Italian accent, he got our order correct, including our thin crust request, and even offered us a few ways to combine things to save a few bucks. \n\nWe ordered a pepperoni pizza, thin crust, with a dinner salad. He mentioned one would be enough for two people. They delivered it to the door pretty quickly. The pizza was super hot when it arrived. Everything was correct and even though we forgot to ask for things like utensils, they included those, napkins, parmesan cheese, pepper flakes, and dressing. The only thing I can complain about were that the cucumbers in the salad could have been fresher. Everything else in the salad (iceberg lettuce, green olives, tomato, onion, and some greens) was fresh and perfect. The pizza crust did get hard after it sat for a while. Maybe that's why people were complaining about it being like cardboard or from the freezer section. I would recommend getting a thinner crust in the future. The cheese on the pizza was so good, salty, greasy, just like a pizza joint should be. Everything came out to about $17 and we gave a $4 tip. \n\nWe were really surprised at all the bad reviews. I have not been inside, only briefly walked by the actual place, so I can't comment on that.\n\nI'm satisfied with the food I got for the price I paid.\n\nDon't let the bad reviews fool you and give this place a try.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-08"}], "soda can": [], "vitamin water": [], "garlic bread with pesto and cheese": [{"excerpts": ["Garlic bread with pesto and cheese is an amazing filler at 4.50"], "author": "Todd G.", "review": "The pizza here is HELLA Bellisimo!

So I don't really know what the quality of all that is.\n\nImma be for real with my boys here. \n\nNegatives:\n\n1. The sauce for pizzas has gone down in quality. \n\n2. The some guys or maybe just 1 guy doesn't understand English very well. So your order might get messed up sometimes. (Happened to me a few times.)\n\nPositives:\n\n1. The pizza's are good. The ingredients (besides the sauce) taste good. The crust isn't incredibly huge like other pizzerias. These have the normal thin crust that everyone should love. \n\n2. Wings are really good. They never disappoint.\n\n3. The Italian panini is crazy good. (I get it with no veggies with light onions on it with pesto sauce.)\n\nThe only thing I'm on the fence about, is that pizza's have flower crumbs from being made on the bottom of the pizza. I'm not a fan but I know people who love it. So take that as you will. \n\nIf you have more insight about other foods by these guys, please let me know. I'm down to try anything with meat and no veggies.
