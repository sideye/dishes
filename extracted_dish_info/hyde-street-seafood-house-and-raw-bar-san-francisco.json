Finally on Friday, March 9th, we made it happen. I made a reservation for dinner at Hyde Street Seafood House through OpenTable about a week prior for a party of five at 6pm.\n\nHappy Hour is 5pm-7pm, so luckily, we made it in time for $1.25 oysters! You do have to order them by the dozen at $15 a pop. The oysters come with mignonette and cocktail sauce. (Note: You can sit at a table and order their HH specials, so feel free to make a reservation if you want to guarantee yourself a table.) With our group, we were able to finish three dozen. That night, they were offering: Skookum (BC), Quilcene (Wa), Hammersley (Wa). I'm into smaller oysters since I find them sweeter and cleaner tasting, so my favs were the Hammersley. We ended up getting two dozen of all varieties and one dozen of just those. For HH, they also have $4 draft pint beers and $1 off certain glasses of wine. We just stuck to bottles of wine, so didn't take advantage of the drink specials.\n\n*Seafood Salad: mixed greens with fresh crab meat, bay shrimp & smoked salmon ($16)\n*New England Clam Chowder ($9)\n*Lobster Bisque ($10)\n*Escargot with garlic herb butter ($13)\n*Sauteed Mussels with fresh herb butter, onion & white wine ($14)\n*Shellfish Combination En Papillote: mussels, clams, scallops & prawns baked in parchment paper with fresh herbs, julienned vegetables, potatoes, white wine, butter & lemon ($25)\n*Garlic Roasted Prawns: served with rice or thyme roasted potatoes & vegetables ($23)\n*Pan Roasted Corvina Sea Bass: served with scaloppini potatoes, vegetables & kalamata olives, tomato, basil garlic sauce ($25)\n*Fettuccini Pasta: with rock shrimp, bay scallops, smoked salmon & chardonnay cream sauce ($25)\n\nWe did our whole dinner family style, so shared everything. I always need some kind of vegetable, so the salad was a great palate cleanser of sorts. Since more than half our group wasn't eating meat, we kept everything seafood centric. I adored the pasta. The cream sauce was so comforting and there was a good amount of seafood. I'm a huge fan of garlic butter, so I enjoyed the escargots. Make sure to dip the complimentary bread in the extra butter. So good! The garlic prawns were also super tasty. Meaty with great flavor. I think my least fav dish was the en papillote, but I'm actually not a huge fan of this style of cooking. We just decided to order it since it was a signature dish of theirs. It's good to note, for those not eating meat, the clam chowder does not have any bacon in it. I made sure to ask before ordering.\n\n*Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Secret Coffee: topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate ($6)\n*Presidential Tawny Porto: matured in wood for ten years ($10.50)\n*Taylor Fladgate Tawny Porto: matured in wood for twenty years ($12)\n*Prosecco Extra Dry La Marca DOC, Italy N/V ($39)\n*Cabernet Sauvignon Kunde Estate Grown, Sonoma Valley, 2013 ($43)\n*Petite Sirah Michael-David, Lodi, 2015 ($50)\n\nTo end our meal, we decided to get two desserts. I just had a bite or so of each as the port was basically my dessert. I did enjoy the 20 over the 10 year. I believe the secret coffee had some alcohol in it, but I had a fair amount to drink by the end of dinner, so not 100% sure. For wine, we actually stuck to three bottles. Started with the bubbly for the oysters, the cab for the apps, and the petite sirah for the entrees. They all paired nicely since we're all red wine drinkers. And all bottles were reasonably priced.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter was awesome. We were actually here for over four hours and never felt rushed. Even though we closed out the restaurant.

Do we want italian, steakhouse, seafood, chinese, Mediterranean? Fine dining, casual, kid friendly, tourist trap? So many choices, not enough time.\n\nWe chose seafood for both nights. Our first night in the city, I decided on Hyde Street Seafood House and Raw Bar, thanks to a recommendation & Yelp. A few things that made my decision easy, PRICE, LOCATION & RECENT REVIEWS. Practically everything on the menu is under $20. And yes, they have an amazing Happy Hour 5-7(even on weekends).  Our reservation was at 6pm, 12 pick n choose oysters for 12 bucks. We ordered them by the truckload. Our party consisted of 14 and our bill was $400 with beers. Unbelievable. The absolute best Ciopinno, I've had. The broth wasn't watery and spicy like other places I've tried in San Francisco. It was thicker, more flavorful and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The lobster bisque wasn't too creamy like the other reviewer described, it was perfect. Every spoonfull packed with shredded lobster, just the way I like it.  The scallops, steak, butterfish, shrimp and salmon were all cooked per-fect-ly  and tasted delicious. The only 2 complaints on the table were the caeser salad and my friend didn't care for his sturgeon fish.  The waiter forewarned him and recommended other fish, but like a stubborn mule, he ordered it anyway.\n\nThe location was a $6 cab from the wharf area. We would've taken the cable car straight up Hyde, but we were late. Hyde Street Seafood House blends right into the residential area with charm. Nautical theme carried throughout the restaurant  and the dining area is very cozy and romantic.\n\nOur server was perfect. Attentive, funny, quick & personable. \n\nThis was not the BEST seafood I've ever had but it was very very good. For under 20 bucks an entree and a 400 buck tab for a big party, this was the BEST seafood restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting San Francisco with a large or small party. It seems like a locals only spot, we were the only tourists there. Make reservations in advance. It's very quaint.\n\n4.5 stars", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-10-06"}, {"excerpts": ["LOVE LOBSTER BISQUE!!\n\n"], "author": "Shirley F.", "review": "LOVE  THIS PLACE!!\nLOVE the OYSTERS!\nLOVE LOBSTER BISQUE!!\n\njust go and grab a few dozens of oyster during happy hour and you will be happy and satisfied!!\n\nService was really good too1!!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-03-27"}, {"excerpts": ["I told him \"no\" and he started telling me how great the lobster bisque is.

I'm a sucker for sitting at a bar, sushi or otherwise, and being able to order food as my appetite demands is perfection to me. This place is one of those unique restaurants that you can order one dish at a time and not feel guilty.\n\nCome early, around 5 or 5:30, deny the table, and sit at the small bar and chat it up with one of the friendly employees. Go a few times and you'll be family. Ask them for suggestions, they won't steer you wrong.\n\nAs for ordering, start with oysters. During Happy Hour (5-7 Monday-Saturday, I think) you can get a dozen for $12. They rotate their oyster offerings, but always have three to choose from. It's rare that their oysters aren't up to snuff, so go for gold and get a mixed plate. Then, when you get seconds, you can choose your favorites.\n\nI rarely order anything other than appetizers. Although solid, the entrees don't have the same appeal to me as eating a bunch of small appetizers. Try the cajun seafood combo, a bowl of clam chowder, or a salad. Check their daily menu for what's in season. You can get a bunch of small plates for the same price as one entree, plus it keeps your taste buds fresh and allows you to build a perfect meal.\n\nI highly recommend the lobster bisque. This creamy soup along with a beer and a dozen oysters is almost enough to act as a meal. It's rich with lobster and perfect on a rainy day.\n\nAfter you've had your fill of dinner, please try dessert. They have an amazing banana bread pudding with enough butter to stop your heart, though surprisingly easy to enjoy. If the banana bread pudding sounds too rich, they also usually offer fresh berries with whipped cream which is a much gentler ending.\n\nIt's easy to imagine this place as a fairly ordinary place if you do the three-course-sit-down thing, but if you like eating small plates, this place is extraordinary with one of the most enjoyable Happy Hours in the city.", "rating": 4, "date": "2006-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["totally the best lobster bisque in the city!!!!

Not as unbelievable as it sounds, but the prawns were cooked perfectly.\n*shellfish en papillote: I guess I forgot how appreciable the true flavor of seafood is. I was thoroughly impressed with this simple dish, and savored the taste of clam, mussel, prawn, and scallop. The julienned veggies that accompanied were nice, steeped in all the shellfish liquor. \n-- All with a few glasses of white wine. Good service. Tucked into an intimate and distinctive spot. \n--Very reasonably priced menu. $$ without drinks, $$$ if you don't feel like sharing.

It's nestled in a predominantly residential neighborhood so parking is pretty tough. Their service is friendly and helpul. The waiter even went so far as to tell me what NOT to get, as well as his favorite dishes.\n\n So this place is supposedly famous for a particular way they prepare their fish, which is wrapping the fish and some veggies in parchment paper and baking it. This is supposed to retain flavor and moistness of the fish. So we ordered the halibut and the fish was very moist, not dry by any means. Other than that though, the fish was ok. It tasted fresh, but was pretty bland in flavor. The veggies in the parchment package were also not very flavorful. \n\n Their seafood salad was good with really fresh tasting baby shrimp, lump crap pieces, and smoked salmon. A pretty small salad for ~12 bucks though. Their lobster bisque was pretty good...it tasted like their base was pureed corn, and the bisque was yellowish in color. It didn't have a strong lobster aroma to it...the pieces of lobster were almost like the consistency of crab since it was a lot of little itty bitty pieces in the bisque. Tasty, but not amazing. \n\n The stuffed shrimp was pretty good; a little salty and quite buttery. The cioppino was good. The soup was tasty, the shrimp in it was ok, the mussels were pretty good, the big scallops were good, but the baby scallops weren't so good.\n\nOverall, good ambiance, good service, great oysters, everything else is pretty standard for a seafood place. Their menu is pretty eclectic from cajun style scallops and shrimp to steak to their french preparation of fish. Wouldn't mind coming back for the oysters. Three people with three entrees, a salad, a soup, oysters = $100.\n\nP.S. Happy hour between 5-7.

Finally on Friday, March 9th, we made it happen. I made a reservation for dinner at Hyde Street Seafood House through OpenTable about a week prior for a party of five at 6pm.\n\nHappy Hour is 5pm-7pm, so luckily, we made it in time for $1.25 oysters! You do have to order them by the dozen at $15 a pop. The oysters come with mignonette and cocktail sauce. (Note: You can sit at a table and order their HH specials, so feel free to make a reservation if you want to guarantee yourself a table.) With our group, we were able to finish three dozen. That night, they were offering: Skookum (BC), Quilcene (Wa), Hammersley (Wa). I'm into smaller oysters since I find them sweeter and cleaner tasting, so my favs were the Hammersley. We ended up getting two dozen of all varieties and one dozen of just those. For HH, they also have $4 draft pint beers and $1 off certain glasses of wine. We just stuck to bottles of wine, so didn't take advantage of the drink specials.\n\n*Seafood Salad: mixed greens with fresh crab meat, bay shrimp & smoked salmon ($16)\n*New England Clam Chowder ($9)\n*Lobster Bisque ($10)\n*Escargot with garlic herb butter ($13)\n*Sauteed Mussels with fresh herb butter, onion & white wine ($14)\n*Shellfish Combination En Papillote: mussels, clams, scallops & prawns baked in parchment paper with fresh herbs, julienned vegetables, potatoes, white wine, butter & lemon ($25)\n*Garlic Roasted Prawns: served with rice or thyme roasted potatoes & vegetables ($23)\n*Pan Roasted Corvina Sea Bass: served with scaloppini potatoes, vegetables & kalamata olives, tomato, basil garlic sauce ($25)\n*Fettuccini Pasta: with rock shrimp, bay scallops, smoked salmon & chardonnay cream sauce ($25)\n\nWe did our whole dinner family style, so shared everything. I always need some kind of vegetable, so the salad was a great palate cleanser of sorts. Since more than half our group wasn't eating meat, we kept everything seafood centric. I adored the pasta. The cream sauce was so comforting and there was a good amount of seafood. I'm a huge fan of garlic butter, so I enjoyed the escargots. Make sure to dip the complimentary bread in the extra butter. So good! The garlic prawns were also super tasty. Meaty with great flavor. I think my least fav dish was the en papillote, but I'm actually not a huge fan of this style of cooking. We just decided to order it since it was a signature dish of theirs. It's good to note, for those not eating meat, the clam chowder does not have any bacon in it. I made sure to ask before ordering.\n\n*Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Secret Coffee: topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate ($6)\n*Presidential Tawny Porto: matured in wood for ten years ($10.50)\n*Taylor Fladgate Tawny Porto: matured in wood for twenty years ($12)\n*Prosecco Extra Dry La Marca DOC, Italy N/V ($39)\n*Cabernet Sauvignon Kunde Estate Grown, Sonoma Valley, 2013 ($43)\n*Petite Sirah Michael-David, Lodi, 2015 ($50)\n\nTo end our meal, we decided to get two desserts. I just had a bite or so of each as the port was basically my dessert. I did enjoy the 20 over the 10 year. I believe the secret coffee had some alcohol in it, but I had a fair amount to drink by the end of dinner, so not 100% sure. For wine, we actually stuck to three bottles. Started with the bubbly for the oysters, the cab for the apps, and the petite sirah for the entrees. They all paired nicely since we're all red wine drinkers. And all bottles were reasonably priced.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter was awesome. We were actually here for over four hours and never felt rushed. Even though we closed out the restaurant.

Anyone in the city who loves oysters knows that's a damn good deal!!\n\nThe hubs and I were staying at the Hilton in Union Square and decided to walk to dinner since it was a mile away. Not too sure that was a great idea. A mile anywhere else would have been easy peasy, but a mile in SF could be taking you up several inclines that will leave you breathless and a little sweaty. Down hill was by no means any easier. By the time we reached the restaurant we built up an appetite for dinner. This excursion was just supposed o be about appetizers and small plates, but what the hell... we made it there! We might as well enjoy ourselves. We of course took Lyft to get back.  \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n1. 2 Dozen Oysters: It was $15 and the when the waiter asked us if we wanted another dozen we were weak to his suggestion. Plus it was like 5 minutes to 7pm and we've already had some wine and between the ambiance of the space and the delicious first dozen it was hard to say no.\n\n2. Escargot: I don't think there is a restaurant in Sacramento (our home base) that offers escargot, and when we saw it on the menu we had to have it. Not often do we get that option at a restaurant. Plus, the hubs and I have had it before liked it and wanted to try it again. Pretty tasty! Texture was chewy and it was covered in butter and garlic. \n\n3. Cioppino: SF is always cold and what better way to warm up then to have some cioppino. I loved how they didn't skimp out on the good seafood.  Large chunks of fish, several pieces of prawns, large scallop, and mussels made it heavy on the protein side. The warm tomato based sauce was flavorful and the noodles were a nice touch!\n\nGreat cozy/intimate place for a quiet dinner with someone special.  I think they have a large table for maybe one large party, but other than that, that's all you get.  Tables are close together that you can hear another person's conversation, but you should mind your own business and focus on who you're with and it's not a problem.\n\nI had a great time!

We tried again the next evening, arriving right at 4:45PM and...success!\n\nThe nice lady even let us in a few minutes before the hour, just because she said it would be more comfortable to wait inside.\n\nA variety of seafood items, and even a few non-seafood items, were had.  It was happy hour, so there were three dozen oysters on the table, two of them mine.  The had skookums.  They had marin bays.  They had a third variety whose name I don't recall.  They were all delicious.\n\nI had the clam chowder, which was tasty.  One of my friends had the famous lobster bisque, and it apparently did not disappoint, either.  Delicious cold appetizers?  Seafood soups?  Are you not sold already?\n\nThey also have escargot.  I don't eat snails often, but when I do, I like them to be prepared correctly... And these ones were perfect. \n\nOne of the members of our dining party had the swordfish, and another had the stuffed rainbow trout.  I sampled the trout, and it was phenomenal.\n\nFor San Francisco, this place is reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, there are just so many appealing items on the menu that it's very difficult not to let things add up on the bill.  But you'll be spending money at a place with quality food, friendly service, and the feel of a neighborhood restaurant.

That night, they were offering: Skookum (BC), Quilcene (Wa), Hammersley (Wa). I'm into smaller oysters since I find them sweeter and cleaner tasting, so my favs were the Hammersley. We ended up getting two dozen of all varieties and one dozen of just those. For HH, they also have $4 draft pint beers and $1 off certain glasses of wine. We just stuck to bottles of wine, so didn't take advantage of the drink specials.\n\n*Seafood Salad: mixed greens with fresh crab meat, bay shrimp & smoked salmon ($16)\n*New England Clam Chowder ($9)\n*Lobster Bisque ($10)\n*Escargot with garlic herb butter ($13)\n*Sauteed Mussels with fresh herb butter, onion & white wine ($14)\n*Shellfish Combination En Papillote: mussels, clams, scallops & prawns baked in parchment paper with fresh herbs, julienned vegetables, potatoes, white wine, butter & lemon ($25)\n*Garlic Roasted Prawns: served with rice or thyme roasted potatoes & vegetables ($23)\n*Pan Roasted Corvina Sea Bass: served with scaloppini potatoes, vegetables & kalamata olives, tomato, basil garlic sauce ($25)\n*Fettuccini Pasta: with rock shrimp, bay scallops, smoked salmon & chardonnay cream sauce ($25)\n\nWe did our whole dinner family style, so shared everything. I always need some kind of vegetable, so the salad was a great palate cleanser of sorts. Since more than half our group wasn't eating meat, we kept everything seafood centric. I adored the pasta. The cream sauce was so comforting and there was a good amount of seafood. I'm a huge fan of garlic butter, so I enjoyed the escargots. Make sure to dip the complimentary bread in the extra butter. So good! The garlic prawns were also super tasty. Meaty with great flavor. I think my least fav dish was the en papillote, but I'm actually not a huge fan of this style of cooking. We just decided to order it since it was a signature dish of theirs. It's good to note, for those not eating meat, the clam chowder does not have any bacon in it. I made sure to ask before ordering.\n\n*Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Secret Coffee: topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate ($6)\n*Presidential Tawny Porto: matured in wood for ten years ($10.50)\n*Taylor Fladgate Tawny Porto: matured in wood for twenty years ($12)\n*Prosecco Extra Dry La Marca DOC, Italy N/V ($39)\n*Cabernet Sauvignon Kunde Estate Grown, Sonoma Valley, 2013 ($43)\n*Petite Sirah Michael-David, Lodi, 2015 ($50)\n\nTo end our meal, we decided to get two desserts. I just had a bite or so of each as the port was basically my dessert. I did enjoy the 20 over the 10 year. I believe the secret coffee had some alcohol in it, but I had a fair amount to drink by the end of dinner, so not 100% sure. For wine, we actually stuck to three bottles. Started with the bubbly for the oysters, the cab for the apps, and the petite sirah for the entrees. They all paired nicely since we're all red wine drinkers. And all bottles were reasonably priced.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter was awesome. We were actually here for over four hours and never felt rushed. Even though we closed out the restaurant.

The king salmon was awesome, and the food and dining experience made the approximately one mile walk to this place worth it.  \n\nThe second time I visited this place, three (3) months later, I'd driven up to SF on short notice for a job interview and figured I'd return to the only place I'd ever eaten at in SF, even if I was going to be dining solo.  The salmon en papillote was great, but the service was second-rate this time; even though it wasn't that busy, simple things like bread and water refills took forever.  I also noticed that they apparently raised the price of the king salmon en papillote in the three or so months since I'd last been here, which vexed me a bit.  Still, my meal was good.  And this time, I took the cable car to and from the restaurant, which made for a decidedly San Franciscan experience, at least in my mind.\n\nThe third time I visited Hyde Street Seafood Cafe, I did so in the company of two high school friends and a mere month after my second visit. We made the same mile or so walking journey to Hyde Street Seafood Cafe that I'd done months earlier.  For the third time in a row, I ordered the same entree (king salmon en papillote) and wasn't disappointed.  Same solid meal.  And this time, the service was considerably better.  Both friends seemed to really enjoy their meals and the experience, and one of them said so explicitly.\n\nAnyway, after three visits here, I think I've gotten a pretty good appreciation for Hyde Street Seafood Cafe.  The bottom line, at least in my mind, is that this place serves really solid seafood and is in a great, picturesque location.  Service is generally pretty good but occasionally mediocre.  Anyway, next time I'm in SF, I'll head to Hyde Street Seafood Cafe again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-08-16"}, {"excerpts": ["The food was amazing, I had the Crushed potato king salmon and would highly recommend getting it.

Finally on Friday, March 9th, we made it happen. I made a reservation for dinner at Hyde Street Seafood House through OpenTable about a week prior for a party of five at 6pm.\n\nHappy Hour is 5pm-7pm, so luckily, we made it in time for $1.25 oysters! You do have to order them by the dozen at $15 a pop. The oysters come with mignonette and cocktail sauce. (Note: You can sit at a table and order their HH specials, so feel free to make a reservation if you want to guarantee yourself a table.) With our group, we were able to finish three dozen. That night, they were offering: Skookum (BC), Quilcene (Wa), Hammersley (Wa). I'm into smaller oysters since I find them sweeter and cleaner tasting, so my favs were the Hammersley. We ended up getting two dozen of all varieties and one dozen of just those. For HH, they also have $4 draft pint beers and $1 off certain glasses of wine. We just stuck to bottles of wine, so didn't take advantage of the drink specials.\n\n*Seafood Salad: mixed greens with fresh crab meat, bay shrimp & smoked salmon ($16)\n*New England Clam Chowder ($9)\n*Lobster Bisque ($10)\n*Escargot with garlic herb butter ($13)\n*Sauteed Mussels with fresh herb butter, onion & white wine ($14)\n*Shellfish Combination En Papillote: mussels, clams, scallops & prawns baked in parchment paper with fresh herbs, julienned vegetables, potatoes, white wine, butter & lemon ($25)\n*Garlic Roasted Prawns: served with rice or thyme roasted potatoes & vegetables ($23)\n*Pan Roasted Corvina Sea Bass: served with scaloppini potatoes, vegetables & kalamata olives, tomato, basil garlic sauce ($25)\n*Fettuccini Pasta: with rock shrimp, bay scallops, smoked salmon & chardonnay cream sauce ($25)\n\nWe did our whole dinner family style, so shared everything. I always need some kind of vegetable, so the salad was a great palate cleanser of sorts. Since more than half our group wasn't eating meat, we kept everything seafood centric. I adored the pasta. The cream sauce was so comforting and there was a good amount of seafood. I'm a huge fan of garlic butter, so I enjoyed the escargots. Make sure to dip the complimentary bread in the extra butter. So good! The garlic prawns were also super tasty. Meaty with great flavor. I think my least fav dish was the en papillote, but I'm actually not a huge fan of this style of cooking. We just decided to order it since it was a signature dish of theirs. It's good to note, for those not eating meat, the clam chowder does not have any bacon in it. I made sure to ask before ordering.\n\n*Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Secret Coffee: topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate ($6)\n*Presidential Tawny Porto: matured in wood for ten years ($10.50)\n*Taylor Fladgate Tawny Porto: matured in wood for twenty years ($12)\n*Prosecco Extra Dry La Marca DOC, Italy N/V ($39)\n*Cabernet Sauvignon Kunde Estate Grown, Sonoma Valley, 2013 ($43)\n*Petite Sirah Michael-David, Lodi, 2015 ($50)\n\nTo end our meal, we decided to get two desserts. I just had a bite or so of each as the port was basically my dessert. I did enjoy the 20 over the 10 year. I believe the secret coffee had some alcohol in it, but I had a fair amount to drink by the end of dinner, so not 100% sure. For wine, we actually stuck to three bottles. Started with the bubbly for the oysters, the cab for the apps, and the petite sirah for the entrees. They all paired nicely since we're all red wine drinkers. And all bottles were reasonably priced.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter was awesome. We were actually here for over four hours and never felt rushed. Even though we closed out the restaurant.

I made sure to ask before ordering.\n\n*Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Secret Coffee: topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate ($6)\n*Presidential Tawny Porto: matured in wood for ten years ($10.50)\n*Taylor Fladgate Tawny Porto: matured in wood for twenty years ($12)\n*Prosecco Extra Dry La Marca DOC, Italy N/V ($39)\n*Cabernet Sauvignon Kunde Estate Grown, Sonoma Valley, 2013 ($43)\n*Petite Sirah Michael-David, Lodi, 2015 ($50)\n\nTo end our meal, we decided to get two desserts. I just had a bite or so of each as the port was basically my dessert. I did enjoy the 20 over the 10 year. I believe the secret coffee had some alcohol in it, but I had a fair amount to drink by the end of dinner, so not 100% sure. For wine, we actually stuck to three bottles. Started with the bubbly for the oysters, the cab for the apps, and the petite sirah for the entrees. They all paired nicely since we're all red wine drinkers. And all bottles were reasonably priced.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter was awesome. We were actually here for over four hours and never felt rushed. Even though we closed out the restaurant. A great, very affordable neighborhood restaurant. With all the food and drinks plus tax and tip, we each paid under $100.

Although a bit salty, it hit the spot on a cold night--hearty and delicious, it was just perfect with the crusty bread.
