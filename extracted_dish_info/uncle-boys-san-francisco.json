This time, I want to say it's a 5/10. \nUncle Boy's serves up burgers and fried things in a simple, no-frills, neighborhood spot. It's clear they're big fans of Manny Pacquiao.\nThey cook up the food on the flat grill right by the doorway. There is a small fridge for beverages in the back. There are just a couple of small tables, so it's mostly a takeout spot. The seats are usually occupied, so I just order for takeout, or call for pickup. The food is tasty, greasy, and messy.\n\nI've tried the following...\n\nAPPETIZERS\n\n$4.55 Jalapeno Poppers - 5 fried jalapenos filled w/ cream cheese\n$4.55 Mozzarella Sticks - 7 fried breaded mozzarella cheese sticks - super cheesy\n$4.55 Zucchini Chips - 10 breaded slices of zucchini\n$4.55 Onion Rings - 5 battered onion rings, fried\n\nLots of fried items. They are mostly all crunchy & heavily breaded. The jalapenos are a little too spicy for me. The zucchini chips are hot and steamy inside. I couldn't even tell what they were until I bit through one.\n\n\nFINGER FOODS\n\n$6.59 Wings - 8 deep fried:\nnot bad chicken wings, a little petite\n\n\nBURGERS\nThe burgers are pretty juicy & tasty and usually quite messy. I've seen them weigh out slabs of ground beef, shape & flatten them into thin, uniform patties. The cheese is always nicely melted over the patty. The buns are toasted, too. I don't like the shredded lettuce, as it becomes soft and wilted. Takeout orders are especially messy and often dripping with sauce.\nPrices aren't too bad for a small business establishment.\n\n$7.49 Nephew - grilled angus beef patty, jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, topped w/ pesto mayo in toasted bun:\ngood, basic burger with juicy beef patty. I can't really taste the pesto mayo though.\n\n$7.49 Cowboy - grilled angus beef patty, American cheese, bacon, onion rings w/ BBQ ranch sauce in toasted bun:\ncrunchy, oily onion rings & juicy patty. I could definitely taste the BBQ sauce in this one.\n\n$7.49 Italian Stallion (formerly Mamma Mia) - pepper jack cheese, 3 mozzarella sticks, lettuce, marinara sauce in toasted bun:\nalso crunchy & oily, with gooey, stringy mozzarella\n\n$7.49 Hip-Poppin - grilled angus beef patty, jalapeno poppers stuffed w/ cream cheese, jack cheese, lettuce & tomato in toasted bun:\nalso good, a little too spicy for me, but manageable with all the cheesy ingredients\n\n$7.49 Hot Mess - grilled angus beef patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, jalapenos topped w/ hot mess sauce in toasted bun:\ngood, way too spicy for me\n\nThey also serve chicken sandwiches, vegan burgers, and hot link sandwiches.\n\nNow I've been pretty satisfied with most of the things I tried. How could I not be? It's high-calorie fried food meant to satiate grumbling hunger pains. It was a good fallback option when you're too tired to cook and need something filling.\nHowever, I haven't returned in a while. I recall they had some serious management issues. There were many times I noticed Uncle Boy's only had one person working in the entire place; taking orders in person, taking orders on the phone, cooking, handling payment, and cleaning. Well actually, poor guy had no spare time for cleaning. No wonder it's hard to get through their phone line when placing a phone order. Need I mention sanitary issues having only one cook deal with cash payments too? \nAfter a couple of times of dealing with extremely slow service, I can't even call it fast food anymore. Nobody should have to wait 45 minutes for a burger to go. When other patrons asked why he was on his own, he replied that the owner was too cheap to pay more staff members. I was surprised that he was so blunt, but I would be disgruntled too. I don't know if they still deal with bottleneck problems during peak times (especially right around closing time), but it's worth mentioning for people who are strictly looking for a time-saving option.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["*Zucchini chips ($4.55) ", "http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uncle-boys-san-francisco#Vb6vbjR_GIGYmsg8CqW7QQ\n"], "author": "Elena N.", "review": "September 18, 2014: National Cheeseburger Day\n\nOn the way home, the roommate asked me what I wanted for dinner.

I think it's the seasoning they put on it, but it tastes so good!\n\nAnyway, we went back again this week because A liked his first burger so much.  This time he got the OG burger, which I think is just like his nephew burger, except without the pesto.  I got the Mama Mia burger, which had fried mozzarella sticks in it plus marinara sauce.  It was huge.  And it was filling.  He also got two orders of fries.  Ah, the fries!\n\nIf there's a lot of people, expect a wait.  The two times we've been there, it's just been one guy running the place, so he took the orders, collected the cash, and made the burgers and fries.

"], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "I struggle most with assigning a rating. This time, I want to say it's a 5/10. \nUncle Boy's serves up burgers and fried things in a simple, no-frills, neighborhood spot. It's clear they're big fans of Manny Pacquiao.\nThey cook up the food on the flat grill right by the doorway. There is a small fridge for beverages in the back. There are just a couple of small tables, so it's mostly a takeout spot. The seats are usually occupied, so I just order for takeout, or call for pickup. The food is tasty, greasy, and messy.\n\nI've tried the following...\n\nAPPETIZERS\n\n$4.55 Jalapeno Poppers - 5 fried jalapenos filled w/ cream cheese\n$4.55 Mozzarella Sticks - 7 fried breaded mozzarella cheese sticks - super cheesy\n$4.55 Zucchini Chips - 10 breaded slices of zucchini\n$4.55 Onion Rings - 5 battered onion rings, fried\n\nLots of fried items. They are mostly all crunchy & heavily breaded. The jalapenos are a little too spicy for me. The zucchini chips are hot and steamy inside. I couldn't even tell what they were until I bit through one.\n\n\nFINGER FOODS\n\n$6.59 Wings - 8 deep fried:\nnot bad chicken wings, a little petite\n\n\nBURGERS\nThe burgers are pretty juicy & tasty and usually quite messy. I've seen them weigh out slabs of ground beef, shape & flatten them into thin, uniform patties. The cheese is always nicely melted over the patty. The buns are toasted, too. I don't like the shredded lettuce, as it becomes soft and wilted. Takeout orders are especially messy and often dripping with sauce.\nPrices aren't too bad for a small business establishment.\n\n$7.49 Nephew - grilled angus beef patty, jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, topped w/ pesto mayo in toasted bun:\ngood, basic burger with juicy beef patty. I can't really taste the pesto mayo though.\n\n$7.49 Cowboy - grilled angus beef patty, American cheese, bacon, onion rings w/ BBQ ranch sauce in toasted bun:\ncrunchy, oily onion rings & juicy patty. I could definitely taste the BBQ sauce in this one.\n\n$7.49 Italian Stallion (formerly Mamma Mia) - pepper jack cheese, 3 mozzarella sticks, lettuce, marinara sauce in toasted bun:\nalso crunchy & oily, with gooey, stringy mozzarella\n\n$7.49 Hip-Poppin - grilled angus beef patty, jalapeno poppers stuffed w/ cream cheese, jack cheese, lettuce & tomato in toasted bun:\nalso good, a little too spicy for me, but manageable with all the cheesy ingredients\n\n$7.49 Hot Mess - grilled angus beef patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, jalapenos topped w/ hot mess sauce in toasted bun:\ngood, way too spicy for me\n\nThey also serve chicken sandwiches, vegan burgers, and hot link sandwiches.\n\nNow I've been pretty satisfied with most of the things I tried. How could I not be? It's high-calorie fried food meant to satiate grumbling hunger pains. It was a good fallback option when you're too tired to cook and need something filling.\nHowever, I haven't returned in a while. I recall they had some serious management issues. There were many times I noticed Uncle Boy's only had one person working in the entire place; taking orders in person, taking orders on the phone, cooking, handling payment, and cleaning. Well actually, poor guy had no spare time for cleaning. No wonder it's hard to get through their phone line when placing a phone order. Need I mention sanitary issues having only one cook deal with cash payments too? \nAfter a couple of times of dealing with extremely slow service, I can't even call it fast food anymore. Nobody should have to wait 45 minutes for a burger to go. When other patrons asked why he was on his own, he replied that the owner was too cheap to pay more staff members. I was surprised that he was so blunt, but I would be disgruntled too. I don't know if they still deal with bottleneck problems during peak times (especially right around closing time), but it's worth mentioning for people who are strictly looking for a time-saving option.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["*Cowboy ($7.49) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uncle-boys-san-francisco#LfZ2jAKg0gRL3BwUkI4ovA\n", "*", "Hot mess ($7.49) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uncle-boys-san-francisco#FV2dbqLFIDrqbAmMXEJV-A\n", "*French fries ($3.25) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uncle-boys-san-francisco#ex2RPXRePVhFmIi7Cx2unA\n", "The cowboy reminded me of the bacon western cheeseburger.

The couple times i've been there, there's only 1 guy working.  He takes your order and cooks it to order right there in front of you.  Cups for drinks are all laid out on the counter for you to help yourself because the employee can literally see if you take a cup and hadn't paid for it.  It's the the type of tiny restaurant that makes you a believer in small business and how someone can get it so right.\n\nFood wise, I've tried many burgers in San Francisco, most recommended to me by Yelp and this burger is by far the best.

There were two  employees there, one female and one male.  Thank goodness that the female was making our burgers, as the male didn't seem to regard taking off his gloves when he was doing certain things.  He may have been newer too as it looked like she was showing him what to do.  \n\nWe took our burgers to go and it took about 15 minutes for us to drive back home.  The pesto sauce was delicious (store bought though). The burgers were a good size and at an affordable price.  However, I wished both burgers were juicy.  His sounds like the ultimate drunk food, but the jalapeno poppers were soggy.  The burger wasn't bad, it was just odd and we wouldn't order them again.  Fries were well seasoned and some were crisp.  Overall, it's not a destination spot, but a solid place in the area when the burger craving hits.  Gotta give them props for some creative items!", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-03-20"}], "italian stallion burger": [{"excerpts": ["The Italian Stallion Burger was so tasty.

Located on a mostly residential Balboa street with plenty of street parking.\n\nThis place is really small.  Behind the counter is the grill.  2 people working - the chef and an order taker.  Was looking around and couldn't find a menu so the nice order lady pointed it out.  I was surprised at how many items they for such a small place - not only burgers, but chicken, veggie burger, wings, chicken tenders, and a host of appetizers.\n\nI opted for the O.G. with cheese, Mom the El Jefe, bro the Chicken Tenders and Mozzrella Sticks.  All were combos with fries and fountain drinks.  The nice order lady helped me through the order.  Not more than 5 minutes later it was ready.  However, somewhere between the nice order lady and the chef they forgot our mozzarella sticks.  I asked for them and they were ready in 2 minutes.\n\nThe burgers were really good.  Fresh veggies, perfectly cooked.  Toasted bun.  Yum,yum, yum.  Mom loved the El Jefe and finished it off.  She hardly ever finishes a burger.  And bro had too much between his chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks so your truly poached some.  That chef is maestro with the fryer.  The tenders and stick where great.  Great flavor and perfectly cooked.  No limp tenders or sticks at Uncle Boys.\n\nGreat food, very reasonable prices, and nice friendly people.  Only issue is finding a place to sit and eat.
