About at my tolerance level for spicyness and I don't know if you can get it toned down or not. \n\nAnother spicy dish was Kung Pao Calamari but I didn't like the Calamari in it. It was those strange scored things that you get when you order a mixed seafood dish and then wonder what those thingy things are. I don't know if it's a different part of the Calimari or if they score it with a cross hatched tool but I've never liked the taste or texture but at least I know what the critter is in mystery meat Chinese assorted seafood. On the other hand our Meetup group host liked the dish. \n\nOur host said that the Hot and Sour Soup was excellent and trusting him because we seemed to like the same things, I found he was on point.
