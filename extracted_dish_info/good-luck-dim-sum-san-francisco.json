Yes, I've only been here once and yes, we kinda scarfed down our lunch, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to come back here every time I visit SF. Good Luck Dim Sum is located in New Chinatown, which I didn't even know exist, and that's why you get a local friend to take you there. It's definitely not a touristy spot, and I hope it stays that way (even though, by virtue of me writing a Yelp! review, I'm condoning more gringo tourists to find it). There are maybe 5, 6 small tables, each sitting four comfortably, so most people get their dim sum to go in styrofoam boxes. Dine-in's no fancier: you get your dim sum piled onto paper plates, eaten with cheap chopsticks or plastic forks. Hey, if that means I get to eat a buttload of delicious dim sum for less than $8 a person, I'm willing to eat off the plastic tray for all I care. And that's why I love this place: It's cheap, it's fast, and it's good. Did I mention it's cheap? Seriously, I'm from San Gabriel, where dim sum is dime a dozen (figuratively speaking), but I've never seen three people fed fully on less than $25, as what happened at Good Luck.

Sweet rice puff with coconut and peanut\n\nRan out, I missed the party and just about to kick myself right now:\n1.) Dry shrimp crepe\n2.) Shrimp taro dumpling (On day 2)\n\nI also observed many who ordered loads of turnip cakes, bbq pork buns, and pot stickers.

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.  They close at 6:30pm everyday and are closed all day on Tuesdays.

Its not that they don't taste good, its more like the experience growing up - spending the entire Sunday afternoon with my parents waiting forever for a table, then again waiting forever for the right dim sum lady to pass by, and if she's out, my weekend will pretty much be ruined and very much wasted. And the fact that I grew up in Hong Kong (where dim sum really originated from) and Sacramento Chinese food is very mediocre does not help with my dislike against dim sum.  I honestly haven't been to a dim sum place since I was like 16, until yesterday, when I randomly walked in Good Luck Dim Sum with my grandpa. \n1st thought to self: Holy crap! There's a long line! It must be good! \n2nd thought: Holy crap! Its only $1.60 for 3 pieces! \n3rd thought : Really? Holy crap its only $1.60 for 3 pieces!!\n\nThere must have been at least 8 people in line, but there were 4 Chinese ladies working behind the counter, so the line moved really quickly. While you're in line, you can grab a sheet menu which has all the items they offer and you can circle whatever you want. If this is gonna be your first time here, I highly suggest ordering a piece of almost everything, grabbing an extra menu, and put stars next to what you liked best for when you come back, because you'll definitely want to. One thing I really like about the idea of to-go dim sum is that I don't have to wait for a table, and I can order just 1 piece of something, whereas at restaurants you would have to get a basket of 3 or 4 pieces.\n\nWe bought over $30 worth of stuff, of which, I particularly liked the BBQ pork bun, flower roll (steamed plain bun shaped like a big knot), and mochi (what they call the sweet rice puff with coconut and peanut).  My grandpa said he would come back, and that says a lot since he is very picky when it comes to Chinese food. Btw, not everything is 3 for $1.60. Custard tart, egg yolk bun, mocha, lotus seed bun, etc etc are 65 cents each, and certain other items are $2.00 each or sold by the pound.\nP.S. paper boxes are 20 cents extra!

I've walked by this long-standing place dozens of times and always noticed the long lines. Funny thing is that I was either on my way to a meal or on my way home after just finishing one. Last Saturday, I was waiting for my car to be serviced when I finally decided yes, I would like to see what the fuss was about here. I didn't know the drill, and frankly everyone in line looked like they knew exactly what they wanted. When I noticed the pink sheet with all the dim sum choices, I was in a bit of a quandary how to order a mix of them until someone handed me a mini-golf pencil for me to circle my choices.\n\nNow here's the stupid part. When I read \"3 for $1.90\", I thought that meant I should choose three different dim sum. With that misconception in my head, I decided to circle six items in that section and add a Custard Tart and a Sweet Rice Bun for $0.90 each (photo: http://bit.ly/1Jv2Ghh). I was quite proud of my thoughtfully coordinated order when I submitted it to one of the three women who were a blur of kinetic energy as they masterfully grabbed the dim sum with their tongs from the various steam baskets and trays (photo: http://bit.ly/1A4n803). What immediately became clear to me was the \"3 for $1.90\" actually meant I was getting three of all six dim sum I ordered.\n\nThat meant I was getting a whopping 18 dim sum in one of those flimsy plastic to-go containers. I was too embarrassed to stop her. She filled that tray so fast that I didn't notice what a hefty bag of dim sum I was about to carry out the door. It was probably too humiliating for me to eat it there at one of the formica tables they have set up since they would have expected the rest of my baseball team to show up. So I lugged all that dim sum back to the waiting room of the car dealership: three Shrimp Dumplings, three Pork Siu Mai, three Beef Siu Mai, three Chicken Siu Mai, three Steamed Pork Dumplings, and three Potstickers (photo: http://bit.ly/1EvQnOK).\n\nIt was just $11.40 for all of that. Luckily, they were out of the sweet ones I ordered, or more likely, the woman felt I ordered enough and moved on to the next customer. You'll be happy to know there is a happy ending to my tragic mistake. As I sat waiting for my car to get ready, I only had time to try one of each kind as I originally intended and found them to be as tasty and abundant as I heard they were. As for the rest of them, I gave them to a young Chinese family who were waiting for their car. I explained my conundrum, and they were happy to take the rest off my hands.

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.

A sample of something delicious here, then move on to the next stop, for one bite, and then a few blocks down to another. There was no set agenda and no list...total spur of the moment.\n\nIt's quite apparent that one of the more popular quick and cheap options along this area best suited for food crawls, are the several storefronts that specialize in dim sum takeout (dubbed \"Dim Sum Bakeries\") with random bakeries selling sweet and savory buns next. You don't even see these kinds of dim sum bakery deli shops in Hong Kong (but they do have el cheapo efficient cooked to order sit down neighborhood eateries that achieve a similar purpose of downscaling it for local folks which are better). And it becomes quite apparent after observing the competitors and Good Luck Dim Sum appears to be the winner. It's not just by the crowds, but also the efficiency, quality, quantity, variety. It's a lottery winning combination, particularly with the target demographic consisting mostly of locals who are Chinese expats from Southern China and some from Hong Kong. It is almost like to them having their egoe$ Swedish massaged with hot stones by a professional from Thailand while offering a Mainland Chinese reflexology foot rub with a pot of lavender tea (tips included).\n\nAnd places like these are also great if you don't want to be arsed waiting hours in line (particularly during Labor Day Weekend) for yum cha at your favorite dim sum joint, rubbing elbow to elbow with even more aggressive FOBs and granny types willing to run your ass over just to get a numbered ticket. Thus the next best thing is just to pick up some takeout/reheat at home, or if you are visiting the area like me, have them fill up a paper plate, then take it to the dining area and wolf it down like goats getting pellets at a petting zoo.\n\nIt all happened so fast...took a check sheet and circled my wish list (I had one entirely In Chinese) then handed it to the employee. Less than a minute later, the plate was packed with goodies, and came to an even $6. $hit, I spend $20 to $30 on yum cha easy (not to mention $1 per person for a pot of tea). No tea here (bring your own, or if you are desperate, there are craptacular boba shops in the area).\n\nHa gow, pork siu mai, dried shrimp cheung fun (a huge monster at that, only $0.70!!!), pan fried daikon cake. I was supposed to \"sample\" right? :-o\n\nThe table spaces fill up quickly, but don't hesistate to ask if someone already seated at the table if there are empty chairs available. \n\nSure, this stuff is not even comparable to a sit down restaurant, but the steamed items are generally still quite hot (the deep fried stuff may be nearing room temperature like the daikon cake). At this rate, don't take the time to nibble and savor....it's PAC MAN time to gobble the stuff up if dining in.\n\nTo assist with this, use the \"ketchup\" and \"mustard\" squirt bottles at the tables. The ketchup bottle (red) is the soy sauce, and probably a tad sweetened. The \"mustard\" bottle is the chili sauce, and I highly recommend you use it, which will elevate the daikon cake and cheung fun to heights you never realized. Heck you are not at Hong Kong Lounge or Koi Palace, so SQUIRT dat chit all over with reckless abandon and let your inner beast run wild. I love my ha gows, but I love GLDS ha gows with chili sauce too! \n\nConclusion?

I would recommend getting these.\n\nSteamed Buns- tried the BBQ pork one and the chicken one. Both were delicious! The BBQ pork one is legit not like the super fake red coloring  one you usually get elsewhere and decent sized pork pieces. The chicken one was seasoned ground chicken although was missing some peas or an egg which is what I usually prefer. \n\nChicken sticky rice - this was average! I've had better back in San Jose. Too much rice compared to chicken ratio but it was cooked right. It is wrapped in banana leaf or lotus leaf or something. Obviously don't eat that part. It had one small slice of Chinese sausage for the whole thing.\n\nPotstickers - not really memorable at all. Not hot and no crispy.

I've walked by this long-standing place dozens of times and always noticed the long lines. Funny thing is that I was either on my way to a meal or on my way home after just finishing one. Last Saturday, I was waiting for my car to be serviced when I finally decided yes, I would like to see what the fuss was about here. I didn't know the drill, and frankly everyone in line looked like they knew exactly what they wanted. When I noticed the pink sheet with all the dim sum choices, I was in a bit of a quandary how to order a mix of them until someone handed me a mini-golf pencil for me to circle my choices.\n\nNow here's the stupid part. When I read \"3 for $1.90\", I thought that meant I should choose three different dim sum. With that misconception in my head, I decided to circle six items in that section and add a Custard Tart and a Sweet Rice Bun for $0.90 each (photo: http://bit.ly/1Jv2Ghh). I was quite proud of my thoughtfully coordinated order when I submitted it to one of the three women who were a blur of kinetic energy as they masterfully grabbed the dim sum with their tongs from the various steam baskets and trays (photo: http://bit.ly/1A4n803). What immediately became clear to me was the \"3 for $1.90\" actually meant I was getting three of all six dim sum I ordered.\n\nThat meant I was getting a whopping 18 dim sum in one of those flimsy plastic to-go containers. I was too embarrassed to stop her. She filled that tray so fast that I didn't notice what a hefty bag of dim sum I was about to carry out the door. It was probably too humiliating for me to eat it there at one of the formica tables they have set up since they would have expected the rest of my baseball team to show up. So I lugged all that dim sum back to the waiting room of the car dealership: three Shrimp Dumplings, three Pork Siu Mai, three Beef Siu Mai, three Chicken Siu Mai, three Steamed Pork Dumplings, and three Potstickers (photo: http://bit.ly/1EvQnOK).\n\nIt was just $11.40 for all of that. Luckily, they were out of the sweet ones I ordered, or more likely, the woman felt I ordered enough and moved on to the next customer. You'll be happy to know there is a happy ending to my tragic mistake. As I sat waiting for my car to get ready, I only had time to try one of each kind as I originally intended and found them to be as tasty and abundant as I heard they were. As for the rest of them, I gave them to a young Chinese family who were waiting for their car. I explained my conundrum, and they were happy to take the rest off my hands.

Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.

Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.

My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.

Each order equals 3 pieces. \n\nDo NOT expect:\nA spot to dine in and socialize. Very limited space with very limited seating. One table that seemed to originally serve as a spot to sit was drowning in to-go boxes. This place is definitely designed for pick-up orders. Its quite crowded so you'll likely find yourself wanting to exit anyways. Oh well, this can be a sweet opportunity to explore china town and find a scenic spot to enjoy your treasured dumplings. \n\nThe sad deal breaker:\nAll the steamed buns I had tasted of raw/undercooked flour. Had to get some iced coffee next door to wash it down. I love egg custard buns, but the ones here were dried out and dissatisfying. Oh man. \n\nThis is my first visit. The other choices tasted pretty good so i'll definitely give it another try some day. These prices are hard to beat too.

Yes, I've only been here once and yes, we kinda scarfed down our lunch, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to come back here every time I visit SF. Good Luck Dim Sum is located in New Chinatown, which I didn't even know exist, and that's why you get a local friend to take you there. It's definitely not a touristy spot, and I hope it stays that way (even though, by virtue of me writing a Yelp! review, I'm condoning more gringo tourists to find it). There are maybe 5, 6 small tables, each sitting four comfortably, so most people get their dim sum to go in styrofoam boxes. Dine-in's no fancier: you get your dim sum piled onto paper plates, eaten with cheap chopsticks or plastic forks. Hey, if that means I get to eat a buttload of delicious dim sum for less than $8 a person, I'm willing to eat off the plastic tray for all I care. And that's why I love this place: It's cheap, it's fast, and it's good. Did I mention it's cheap? Seriously, I'm from San Gabriel, where dim sum is dime a dozen (figuratively speaking), but I've never seen three people fed fully on less than $25, as what happened at Good Luck.

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.

Nonetheless we ended up ordering:\n\nChicken Siu Mai & Beef Siu Mai - both were average to me because they were a little drier than I'm used to but it was still good. I preferred the beef and my boyfriend referred the chicken.\n\nDumplings - we ordered the shrimp one & the shrimp and chive one. Both were fresh and delicious! I would recommend getting these.\n\nSteamed Buns- tried the BBQ pork one and the chicken one. Both were delicious! The BBQ pork one is legit not like the super fake red coloring  one you usually get elsewhere and decent sized pork pieces. The chicken one was seasoned ground chicken although was missing some peas or an egg which is what I usually prefer. \n\nChicken sticky rice - this was average! I've had better back in San Jose. Too much rice compared to chicken ratio but it was cooked right. It is wrapped in banana leaf or lotus leaf or something. Obviously don't eat that part. It had one small slice of Chinese sausage for the whole thing.\n\nPotstickers - not really memorable at all. Not hot and no crispy. Pass.\n\negg rolls- I don't recommend as it was cold, didn't have much filling, and really greasy. Also pass. \n\nRed bean Fried Sesame ball- bomb! Hot fresh and crispy. 80 cents each. Wish I got more.\n\nI would normally give this place 3 stars but rounded up to 4 because all of this was under $25 for two big eaters and we had 3 chicken steamed buns and 3 pieces of chicken Siu Mai after! \n\nThey pile everything on a paper plate and give you two little paper boat trays to eat and it's on a kitchen lunch tray if you dine in.

Last Saturday, I was waiting for my car to be serviced when I finally decided yes, I would like to see what the fuss was about here. I didn't know the drill, and frankly everyone in line looked like they knew exactly what they wanted. When I noticed the pink sheet with all the dim sum choices, I was in a bit of a quandary how to order a mix of them until someone handed me a mini-golf pencil for me to circle my choices.\n\nNow here's the stupid part. When I read \"3 for $1.90\", I thought that meant I should choose three different dim sum. With that misconception in my head, I decided to circle six items in that section and add a Custard Tart and a Sweet Rice Bun for $0.90 each (photo: http://bit.ly/1Jv2Ghh). I was quite proud of my thoughtfully coordinated order when I submitted it to one of the three women who were a blur of kinetic energy as they masterfully grabbed the dim sum with their tongs from the various steam baskets and trays (photo: http://bit.ly/1A4n803). What immediately became clear to me was the \"3 for $1.90\" actually meant I was getting three of all six dim sum I ordered.\n\nThat meant I was getting a whopping 18 dim sum in one of those flimsy plastic to-go containers. I was too embarrassed to stop her. She filled that tray so fast that I didn't notice what a hefty bag of dim sum I was about to carry out the door. It was probably too humiliating for me to eat it there at one of the formica tables they have set up since they would have expected the rest of my baseball team to show up.

We made it out of there with 2 orders of har gao, 1 order of pork siu mai, 1 order of chicken siu mai--which, by the way, is the lighter and less fatty version of the pork and the one I prefer--1 order of steamed bbq pork bun and 2 orders of pan fried shrimp and pork chives for $11.

I timed them because our driver posting illegally on Clement (which is the only way to do it) told me he waited exactly that amount of time when I got back to the car.  \n\n3)  Those Chinese ladies behind the counter are fast and more efficient than ants in a colony.  The person in front of us tried to ask for a pen so she can give them her order on that pink menu sheet and she was told, \"No!  Just tell me.  I remember!\"  And Chinese lady did remember.  My turn came next and like a pro, I rattled off one order after another and she boxed it all up in about a minute.  She repeated my order to me in such lightning fast fashion, I didn't really understand her.  But I trusted her efficiency more than my own memory so I just agreed and gratefully accepted my precious pink box.\n\n4)  Best dim sum I've had in a long time.

It might be because it was the first dim sum I ever had in San Francisco or it might be because I am painfully and blindingly white, but I really do think that Good Luck is the best dim sum experience that I've had in this city so far.\n\nToday, my boyfriend and I had the shrimp and chive dumplings, the chicken siu mai, the crystal dumplings, the vegetable pork bun, and some chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  And tea.  It was $10.  In fact, every time I've gone it has cost about $5 per person and I've left stuffed, so I would say that's fairly standard.\n\nThings I like about individual items: The sticky rice is almost unbearably good - the flavor is very rich and the texture so creamy!  The fried taro dumplings are some of my favorite things to have there.  I had them once and I can't stop thinking about them - the skin is thick and chewy, and the filling is rich and nutty.  And it's fried!  What's not to love?  The veggie and pork bun has a lot of ginger in it, which adds a whole new dimension to the typical meat-on-starchfest that is dim sum.  And the BBQ pork bun: because sometimes you really do want a meat-on-starchfest.\n\nThings I like about the food in general: I haven't gotten anything there that wasn't incredibly flavorful and rich, but they manage to do so without an off-putting amount of oil.  Even the predominantly veggie-based fillings glom together perfectly, making it really easy to enjoy every component of every morsel in every bite.  The wrappers are tasty, too, be they soft and fluffy or smooth, thick, and chewy.  And whatever brand of soy sauce they use is rad (I know that's probably an ignorant thing to say, but I've had a fair amount of dark soy sauce and this stuff is better - I swear!).\n\nMost people don't like the ambiance of eating there, but I have to say i really do.  If you can manage to snag a table, sitting there and gorging yourself in the comfortingly shabby dining area and watching everyone talk, eat, yell, and otherwise bustle around you is a very good time.  It's not a fine dining experience, but I don't really think it's supposed to be.

Asian food on the cheap, some will love it and some with more refined palates will not like some items but as my friend said best... you get what you pay for. We ordered a boatload since this was my first REAL journey for \"dim sum\" outside a sample or two so we ordered Sweet Rice Bun, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, Shrimp Dumplings, pork shu mai, beef shu mai, har gow, chicken siu mai, Hom Sui Gok, Chive dumplings w/ shrimp, Steamed Pork Dumplings, seasame ball, custard, and a egg yolk bun. We got all this which included two orders of certain items and two drinks for $16.60.  Recession budget... accomplished.\n\nCONS \nThe steamed bun seemed overly doughy. The Siu Mai (pork, beef, chicken) tasted like mystery meat. The sesame balls we were only able to eat a couple bites of, the filling just didn't mesh well with us. The other items, besides the ones listed below, while not terrible were nothing special, just food. They run out of food fast so you have to make sure you get there early as two items we had to substitute something else for. Service was slower than we heard, only 5 people in line and it took 21 minutes to leave. Parking is TERRIBLE. \n\nPROS \nContrary to some, the food was hot and looked mostly appealing, and this is even after calling ahead, stood in line for 10 minutes (we'll talk about that later), and drove about 7 minutes to the spot we ate at. The pieces were HUGE compared to other dum sum I had seen. Chive and shrimp dumplings were excellent, nice mix of shrimp and not just chives and a micro shrimp. BBQ baked bun was a good mix between sweet and salty. The sweet rice bun made me rediscover my inner 1/16th Asian side. \n\nWe heard all the comical or honest reviews about this place having rude workers however I don't think they are rude as much as extremely busy. It just reminded me of my visit to NYC with food vendors and shops where they're trying to move you along so the line can get shorter and have no time for small talk. Piece of advice... fill out your pink order form since we witnessed what happens to anyone who dares try the twice menu over routine... not pretty. I stand 6' and weigh on the higher portion of 200lb club, played football, went to bars with drunk idiots but never felt as intimidated as I felt glaring into the eyes of those tiny Asian ladies. =) I had to laugh since I almost felt like Seinfeld did with the infamous \"Soup Nazi\" episode: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02RdkvI6zo&feature=related \n\nAlthough we called ahead when coming in we didn't know do we stand in line or just step to the counter but the stern looks by the ladies just had us jump in line since we saw only 5 people in line. While one lady was very short another suggested something else and wished us well on our trip so maybe bark worse than bite. =) \n\nSo overall on the fence with this place... a few items we really enjoyed, some we did not and with soo many dim sum places in the city not sure this is a \"must have\" as others feel but it definitely gave us our money's worth on the experience alone.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-02-21"}, {"excerpts": ["shark fin dumpling\nchicken siu mai\nvegetable pork bun\n"], "author": "Priscilla L.", "review": "I know it's a hole in the wall, but their dim sum is excellent.

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.

It might be because it was the first dim sum I ever had in San Francisco or it might be because I am painfully and blindingly white, but I really do think that Good Luck is the best dim sum experience that I've had in this city so far.\n\nToday, my boyfriend and I had the shrimp and chive dumplings, the chicken siu mai, the crystal dumplings, the vegetable pork bun, and some chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  And tea.  It was $10.  In fact, every time I've gone it has cost about $5 per person and I've left stuffed, so I would say that's fairly standard.\n\nThings I like about individual items: The sticky rice is almost unbearably good - the flavor is very rich and the texture so creamy!  The fried taro dumplings are some of my favorite things to have there.  I had them once and I can't stop thinking about them - the skin is thick and chewy, and the filling is rich and nutty.  And it's fried!  What's not to love?  The veggie and pork bun has a lot of ginger in it, which adds a whole new dimension to the typical meat-on-starchfest that is dim sum.  And the BBQ pork bun: because sometimes you really do want a meat-on-starchfest.\n\nThings I like about the food in general: I haven't gotten anything there that wasn't incredibly flavorful and rich, but they manage to do so without an off-putting amount of oil.  Even the predominantly veggie-based fillings glom together perfectly, making it really easy to enjoy every component of every morsel in every bite.  The wrappers are tasty, too, be they soft and fluffy or smooth, thick, and chewy.  And whatever brand of soy sauce they use is rad (I know that's probably an ignorant thing to say, but I've had a fair amount of dark soy sauce and this stuff is better - I swear!).\n\nMost people don't like the ambiance of eating there, but I have to say i really do.  If you can manage to snag a table, sitting there and gorging yourself in the comfortingly shabby dining area and watching everyone talk, eat, yell, and otherwise bustle around you is a very good time.  It's not a fine dining experience, but I don't really think it's supposed to be.

And the fact that I grew up in Hong Kong (where dim sum really originated from) and Sacramento Chinese food is very mediocre does not help with my dislike against dim sum.

Funny thing is that I was either on my way to a meal or on my way home after just finishing one. Last Saturday, I was waiting for my car to be serviced when I finally decided yes, I would like to see what the fuss was about here. I didn't know the drill, and frankly everyone in line looked like they knew exactly what they wanted. When I noticed the pink sheet with all the dim sum choices, I was in a bit of a quandary how to order a mix of them until someone handed me a mini-golf pencil for me to circle my choices.\n\nNow here's the stupid part. When I read \"3 for $1.90\", I thought that meant I should choose three different dim sum. With that misconception in my head, I decided to circle six items in that section and add a Custard Tart and a Sweet Rice Bun for $0.90 each (photo: http://bit.ly/1Jv2Ghh). I was quite proud of my thoughtfully coordinated order when I submitted it to one of the three women who were a blur of kinetic energy as they masterfully grabbed the dim sum with their tongs from the various steam baskets and trays (photo: http://bit.ly/1A4n803). What immediately became clear to me was the \"3 for $1.90\" actually meant I was getting three of all six dim sum I ordered.\n\nThat meant I was getting a whopping 18 dim sum in one of those flimsy plastic to-go containers. I was too embarrassed to stop her. She filled that tray so fast that I didn't notice what a hefty bag of dim sum I was about to carry out the door. It was probably too humiliating for me to eat it there at one of the formica tables they have set up since they would have expected the rest of my baseball team to show up. So I lugged all that dim sum back to the waiting room of the car dealership: three Shrimp Dumplings, three Pork Siu Mai, three Beef Siu Mai, three Chicken Siu Mai, three Steamed Pork Dumplings, and three Potstickers (photo: http://bit.ly/1EvQnOK).\n\nIt was just $11.40 for all of that. Luckily, they were out of the sweet ones I ordered, or more likely, the woman felt I ordered enough and moved on to the next customer. You'll be happy to know there is a happy ending to my tragic mistake. As I sat waiting for my car to get ready, I only had time to try one of each kind as I originally intended and found them to be as tasty and abundant as I heard they were. As for the rest of them, I gave them to a young Chinese family who were waiting for their car. I explained my conundrum, and they were happy to take the rest off my hands.

I stand 6' and weigh on the higher portion of 200lb club, played football, went to bars with drunk idiots but never felt as intimidated as I felt glaring into the eyes of those tiny Asian ladies. =) I had to laugh since I almost felt like Seinfeld did with the infamous \"Soup Nazi\" episode: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02RdkvI6zo&feature=related \n\nAlthough we called ahead when coming in we didn't know do we stand in line or just step to the counter but the stern looks by the ladies just had us jump in line since we saw only 5 people in line. While one lady was very short another suggested something else and wished us well on our trip so maybe bark worse than bite. =) \n\nSo overall on the fence with this place... a few items we really enjoyed, some we did not and with soo many dim sum places in the city not sure this is a \"must have\" as others feel but it definitely gave us our money's worth on the experience alone.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-02-21"}, {"excerpts": ["My other favorite is the sweet rice bun, now these are a ball of rice, but its not normal rice its flavored and filled with bbq pork and super yummy!!!

Yes, I've only been here once and yes, we kinda scarfed down our lunch, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to come back here every time I visit SF. Good Luck Dim Sum is located in New Chinatown, which I didn't even know exist, and that's why you get a local friend to take you there. It's definitely not a touristy spot, and I hope it stays that way (even though, by virtue of me writing a Yelp! review, I'm condoning more gringo tourists to find it). There are maybe 5, 6 small tables, each sitting four comfortably, so most people get their dim sum to go in styrofoam boxes. Dine-in's no fancier: you get your dim sum piled onto paper plates, eaten with cheap chopsticks or plastic forks. Hey, if that means I get to eat a buttload of delicious dim sum for less than $8 a person, I'm willing to eat off the plastic tray for all I care. And that's why I love this place: It's cheap, it's fast, and it's good. Did I mention it's cheap? Seriously, I'm from San Gabriel, where dim sum is dime a dozen (figuratively speaking), but I've never seen three people fed fully on less than $25, as what happened at Good Luck. The best thing is, the dim sum were actually very good. I can't even remember all the different dim sum we ordered.

As a result, I tend to be pretty skeptical of takeout dim sum places, but this place is one of the exceptions I'll make. \n\nI've come here a handful of times over the years. They have most of the common items you'll find in a dim sum restaurant, and everything is made to take out. They do have a dining area inside with a few tables though, and they can give you a tray to take your food over and eat there.\n\nGenerally one of the problems with takeout places is that the food sits out at the counter forever so things aren't fresh. But since this place has high demand, food gets ordered and replaced fairly regularly. Unlike other takeout dim sum I've had, this place always had food that you could tell was just freshly made.\n\nYou can order from a sheet of paper, or if you're Cantonese you can just tell them what you want. I find that they're faster if you speak to them in Cantonese because then they don't have to check against a paper to make sure they got everything.\n\nTheir porridge is pretty good here. They don't give a description in English but it's porridge with pork and preserved eggs. If you choose to dine in, all the stuff they give you is disposable so you'll get a tall container with a short plastic spoon.

How is Good Luck different than the dozens of take-out dim sum joints on Clement? Why is Good Luck my unquestionable SF take-out dim summery of choice?\n\nThree words: \"Char Siu Bao\" -- their steamed barbecue pork buns.\n\nScientifically speaking, pork buns are the true measure of dim summery. Try a dozen different Chinese buns, and you might find buns like these:\n\n#1. Buns hard as rocks!\n#2. Buns too tough to chew!\n#3. Squishy, soggy buns!\n#4. Meatless buns!\n#5. Fowl buns!\n#6. Misshapen buns!\n#7. Grotesquely huge buns!\n#8. Tiny buns!\n#9. Waaay overpriced buns!\n#10. Tasteless buns!\n#11. Cold, frigid buns!\n \nAnd then you try Good Luck's #12. Mmmmm, nummy, perfect buns!\n\nNICE BUNS! -- FIVE STARS!\n\nOkay, okay, silliness aside, they're also pretty hot buns.\n\n=D\n\nIn ten years, the price has gone from $1.10 for three, to $1.50 for three. Now that's just amazing.\n\nBeware, bun-lovers: the lines here are insane. There are lines at eight in the morning. Saturday at noon, you're easily looking at a half hour to 45-minute wait for take-out dim sum.\n\nNow here's the trick! If you've got a large order, you can call in advance and say, \"I'd like your hot buns tomorrow at noon,\" and when you show up, your buns will be waiting. Skip the line, while everyone else gives you dirty looks. Now this is where you pay, open up one of Good Luck's hot pink boxes and enjoy a sample of one of your hot buns in front of everyone...\n\nI'll leave you with some favorites:\n- the Rice Porridge is great for breakfast and dirty cheap at a buck and change.\n- Chive Dumplings are an undiscovered squishy culinary treasure, seriously.\n- I've yet to find any restaurant that serves crispier Chinese Egg Rolls.\n- And if your mouth still craves some fun, grab a handful of Good Luck's Sweet Rice Buns. =)", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-03-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We tried some of everything except the chicken feet and porridge.

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.

So from what I can recall...Like a cheap Asian, I could practically sniff out the epicness of this place while staring at a list of Dim Sum reviews on Yelp early Sunday afternoon.\n\nThis place has a solid rating for a reason. It's not gourmet by any means, and the format for ordering food is rather confusing if you have no idea what you're doing. Luckily, the ladies behind the counter have a working knowledge of English and they'll bark out their demands while you puzzle over the list of dim sum they offer. \n\nIt's a really tiny hole in the wall joint and there isn't a lot of space for seating inside. Most people here seem to order to go, which seems like a good choice if you live nearby. Either way, you grab a little pink sheet of paper with their menu and find a golf pencil. You circle what you want and indicate the quantity somewhere off to the side if you want more than one order. It can be a bit confusing if you don't know your dim sum, so beware! After you make your choices, you show your paper to the Chinese lady behind the counter and she'll grab a pink box and shove your food up in the hizzay. So if you eat in, or take out, it all goes in the same packaging. \n\nThe food very much reflects the people in the place. Hardcore. The three of us ordered about everything on the menu, and the lady was able to calculate it all by hand. Jeez...that's reinforcing a stereotype right there. Their buns and dumplings were very solid. As in greasy, filling, and quite tasty. No delicate little flowers here...\n\nI was pretty happy with most of the food here, however I was a bit disappointed in the chicken feet and their pork spareribs in black bean sauce. The chicken feet seemed to be cooked all mushy and the flavor was a bit off. Both the chicken feet and pork spareribs had these weird bone splinters. Like they had bought discounted chicken's feet...the ones that were broken from the genetically retarded chickens from KFC or something. \n\nI'd probably give this place more of a 3.5 stars...their cooler drinks were a bit expensive for what they were. Asian juice boxes should not be a dollar each! However the overall price of this place is pretty freakin' cheap. It makes me feel very happy deep inside. Meow. \n\nAlso...if you're a vegetarian...I'd watch out how the food is prepared. As I was enjoying my dim sum and commenting on how heavy the food felt, my eyes rested upon a stack of boxes in the corridor to the kitchen. It took a while for me to comprehend in my food-coma-induced-haze...but there it was...LARD. \n\nDelicious.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-11-11"}, {"excerpts": ["We got 3 baked charshu bao, 2 order each of har gaw and shu mai, 1 order of pan fried leek dumplings, 1/2 lb each of chicken feet and steamed pork ribs and 1 order of haam sui gok.\n\n"], "author": "Steven P.", "review": "$16 and you get a lot of good food.

The dumpling skin is not too think, and you get a generous serving of tasty shrimp inside each one.\n\nSiu mai (pork) - these are a little greasy but are very flavourful and a good size.\n\nLo bak go (turnip cake) - usually my favourite dim sum item, i would say that they are only average to slightly above here. Still they are way better than the ones you buy in the store and are dirt cheap for $1.50.\n\nWu tau kau (fried taro dumpling) - again, a little greasy, but what do you expect - they are deep fried! very tasty and large too.\n\nLo mai gai (sticky rice with chicken in lotus leaf) - these are awesome. I think they're only $1.80 and are almost a whole meal! They even taste good if you re-steam them the next day.\n\nThe only dim sum they don't have which I like is cheung fun (rice noodle roll), which is a shame but not worthy of deducting a star. They have a bunch of other items on the other menu: bao, chicken feet etc which i haven't tried cos I can't really eat that much!\n\nOverall, excellent place for cheap, solo eats, or to take home for several people.

We ordered a boatload since this was my first REAL journey for \"dim sum\" outside a sample or two so we ordered Sweet Rice Bun, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, Shrimp Dumplings, pork shu mai, beef shu mai, har gow, chicken siu mai, Hom Sui Gok, Chive dumplings w/ shrimp, Steamed Pork Dumplings, seasame ball, custard, and a egg yolk bun. We got all this which included two orders of certain items and two drinks for $16.60.  Recession budget... accomplished.\n\nCONS \nThe steamed bun seemed overly doughy. The Siu Mai (pork, beef, chicken) tasted like mystery meat. The sesame balls we were only able to eat a couple bites of, the filling just didn't mesh well with us. The other items, besides the ones listed below, while not terrible were nothing special, just food.

Service was slower than we heard, only 5 people in line and it took 21 minutes to leave.

The pieces were HUGE compared to other dum sum I had seen. Chive and shrimp dumplings were excellent, nice mix of shrimp and not just chives and a micro shrimp. BBQ baked bun was a good mix between sweet and salty. The sweet rice bun made me rediscover my inner 1/16th Asian side. \n\nWe heard all the comical or honest reviews about this place having rude workers however I don't think they are rude as much as extremely busy.

I stand 6' and weigh on the higher portion of 200lb club, played football, went to bars with drunk idiots but never felt as intimidated as I felt glaring into the eyes of those tiny Asian ladies. =) I had to laugh since I almost felt like Seinfeld did with the infamous \"Soup Nazi\" episode: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02RdkvI6zo&feature=related \n\nAlthough we called ahead when coming in we didn't know do we stand in line or just step to the counter but the stern looks by the ladies just had us jump in line since we saw only 5 people in line.

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.  They close at 6:30pm everyday and are closed all day on Tuesdays.

Yes, I've only been here once and yes, we kinda scarfed down our lunch, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to come back here every time I visit SF. Good Luck Dim Sum is located in New Chinatown, which I didn't even know exist, and that's why you get a local friend to take you there. It's definitely not a touristy spot, and I hope it stays that way (even though, by virtue of me writing a Yelp! review, I'm condoning more gringo tourists to find it). There are maybe 5, 6 small tables, each sitting four comfortably, so most people get their dim sum to go in styrofoam boxes. Dine-in's no fancier: you get your dim sum piled onto paper plates, eaten with cheap chopsticks or plastic forks. Hey, if that means I get to eat a buttload of delicious dim sum for less than $8 a person, I'm willing to eat off the plastic tray for all I care. And that's why I love this place: It's cheap, it's fast, and it's good. Did I mention it's cheap? Seriously, I'm from San Gabriel, where dim sum is dime a dozen (figuratively speaking), but I've never seen three people fed fully on less than $25, as what happened at Good Luck. The best thing is, the dim sum were actually very good. I can't even remember all the different dim sum we ordered. Here's a partial list: \nHar Gow (shrimp dumpling)\nBeef Siu Mai\nShrimp Taro dumpling - this one was suuuuper taro-y (ie. gummy)\nChicken and sausage rice - something new for me, and absolutely delicious\nChinese Chive Dumpling\nFried Sesame Ball\nCustard - a must for me every time, and they do it hear perfectly; glistening yolky goodness\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is a truly blissful dim sum experience, and a must try even if you're just in SF for a stopover. Don't tell everyone, though; I don't wanna wait in line too long for my next dim sum fix.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-05-20"}, {"excerpts": ["$0.85\nsweet rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaves $1.80\nchicken and sausage rice $2.30"], "author": "Priscilla L.", "review": "I know it's a hole in the wall, but their dim sum is excellent.  So what if you miss out on the big round tables and the parade of waitresses pushing their carts like an assembly line.  \n\nMy husband thinks dim sum is bizarre. I guess it would translate to a procession of Stepford Wives carrying trays of toothpick-impaled weenie dogs to me.  Anyway, he thinks getting bits and pieces of appetizer and eating them while the regular meal never arrives.  He could deal with buying it all at once much better.\n\nI admit, waiting in line is a drag -- worse than waiting in line at See's Candy's where there's always a couple of people ahead of you who want to pick their box of candy piece by piece.\n\nBUT the dim sum is great and cheap.  I made a quick stop after a doctor's appointment and eat some deep fried stuffed dumplings (3 for $1.45)  shrimp dumplings (3 for $1.55), and chive dumplings with shrimp (3 for $1.55).  Then, I got 6 sweet rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaves (thems the big 'uns for $1.80) and salted pork wrapped in bamboo leaves ($1.90) for my lunches.\n\nGreat food for cheap!
