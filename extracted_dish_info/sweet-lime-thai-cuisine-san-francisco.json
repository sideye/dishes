Not only do they just have your standard pads and curries (even though they have those) they also have lots of stir fries, appetizers, and entrees. Almost anything that has regular meat in it can be made vegetarian with the substitute of tofu or braised gluten they offer (AWESOME FOR VEGETARIANS!) Their tofu was super firm and well marinated, seriously, tofu lover's HEAVEN. They also have a Vegan Crispy Roll with Taro root for you to try! \n- Service is wonderful. Our waiter was extremely attentive and courteous and the owner even came to talk to me and my BF for almost 10 minutes after we sat down. She chatted with us about the Jazz Festival that day and the surrounding area, super sweet lady!\n- Food is well plated, fresh, and delicious! I got the fresh roll to share with the boy and  the mint leaves in it complimented it super well. Their peanut sauce was different than the normal ones you usually encounter but was still so good. I got the Samm Kasat which was a spicy green pepper stir fry with eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu. I asked for medium spicy and it was EXACTLY that. It was really delicious (I'm pretty sure I don't have to rave about the AMAZING tofu again). I also ordered a Thai coffee which was not too bad but nothing too special or amazing.\n-Spiciness. Unlike most Thai places that usually don't take you seriously when you ask for your food spicy, this place will do exactly what you want. I've felt that when I ask for my dish to be spicy at most Thai restaurants they usually ignore me because they don't think I can handle it. Well this place, definitely honors your request. A HUGE plus!\n\nCONS: \n- PORTION SIZE. My dish was TINY. It was a tiny plate of stir fry that cost me $13 without rice while my bf's standard dish of pad thai which was almost 2x bigger cost $9. What?! How does this make any sense. My friend ordered a salmond dish and it was MINISCULE and cost her over $10. Ridiculous, portion sizes are no bueno here. \n- Small restaurant. If you're coming in a large group, definitely make reservations! This isn't that big of a con but just a warning that this place DOES get crowded FAST.\n- Salty as the DEAD SEA. Even though my Samm Kasat was pretty tasty, I could have done with about HALF the amount of salt in this dish. It was sooooooo salty I felt like I had just gone swimming in the Dead Sea and swallowed a gulp full of water. \n- Limited alcohol selection. I feel that most of the Thai restaurants I've gone to in the area usually have a pretty wide selection of alcoholc drinks for me to choose from. From a lychee martini just to a variety of unique beers. While this place has your standard Singha beer and a couple of wines, that's it! I'd like to go to a place where I can get a yummy mojito to pair with my meal.\n\nConclusion, food is pretty darn good but definitely NOT worth the price. The portions are ridiculously small and I really honestly think you can find something that tastes just as good and get a better bang for your buck somewhere else. True, it's probably one of the better Thai places in Pac Heights (definitely a million times better than Thai Stick) but not really worth the money. I'll probably find myself coming here once in a while if I'm in the area, craving Thai food, and don't want to travel too far.

Not only do they just have your standard pads and curries (even though they have those) they also have lots of stir fries, appetizers, and entrees. Almost anything that has regular meat in it can be made vegetarian with the substitute of tofu or braised gluten they offer (AWESOME FOR VEGETARIANS!) Their tofu was super firm and well marinated, seriously, tofu lover's HEAVEN. They also have a Vegan Crispy Roll with Taro root for you to try! \n- Service is wonderful. Our waiter was extremely attentive and courteous and the owner even came to talk to me and my BF for almost 10 minutes after we sat down. She chatted with us about the Jazz Festival that day and the surrounding area, super sweet lady!\n- Food is well plated, fresh, and delicious! I got the fresh roll to share with the boy and  the mint leaves in it complimented it super well. Their peanut sauce was different than the normal ones you usually encounter but was still so good. I got the Samm Kasat which was a spicy green pepper stir fry with eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu. I asked for medium spicy and it was EXACTLY that. It was really delicious (I'm pretty sure I don't have to rave about the AMAZING tofu again). I also ordered a Thai coffee which was not too bad but nothing too special or amazing.\n-Spiciness. Unlike most Thai places that usually don't take you seriously when you ask for your food spicy, this place will do exactly what you want. I've felt that when I ask for my dish to be spicy at most Thai restaurants they usually ignore me because they don't think I can handle it. Well this place, definitely honors your request. A HUGE plus!\n\nCONS: \n- PORTION SIZE. My dish was TINY. It was a tiny plate of stir fry that cost me $13 without rice while my bf's standard dish of pad thai which was almost 2x bigger cost $9. What?! How does this make any sense. My friend ordered a salmond dish and it was MINISCULE and cost her over $10. Ridiculous, portion sizes are no bueno here. \n- Small restaurant. If you're coming in a large group, definitely make reservations! This isn't that big of a con but just a warning that this place DOES get crowded FAST.\n- Salty as the DEAD SEA. Even though my Samm Kasat was pretty tasty, I could have done with about HALF the amount of salt in this dish. It was sooooooo salty I felt like I had just gone swimming in the Dead Sea and swallowed a gulp full of water. \n- Limited alcohol selection. I feel that most of the Thai restaurants I've gone to in the area usually have a pretty wide selection of alcoholc drinks for me to choose from. From a lychee martini just to a variety of unique beers. While this place has your standard Singha beer and a couple of wines, that's it! I'd like to go to a place where I can get a yummy mojito to pair with my meal.\n\nConclusion, food is pretty darn good but definitely NOT worth the price. The portions are ridiculously small and I really honestly think you can find something that tastes just as good and get a better bang for your buck somewhere else. True, it's probably one of the better Thai places in Pac Heights (definitely a million times better than Thai Stick) but not really worth the money. I'll probably find myself coming here once in a while if I'm in the area, craving Thai food, and don't want to travel too far.

It wasn't bad persay, just decidedly bland.  Sometimes people assume that fried rice is a bland dish, but actually, I think that when it's done well, it is actually very flavorful...sadly, that was not the case here.  In fact, I was so disinterested in it, I didn't even take home the leftovers, which is not generally like me!\n\nIt should be noted that you can get regular jasmine rice or brown rice, so if you're trying to stick to the super-healthy thing, they've got your back!  Also, the food presentations are beautiful:  even your rice comes in the shape of a heart!  The salads my friends got were drop-dead gorgeous, and reportedly quite scrumptuous, too, although I didn't try them personally.\n\nI will definitely be back here!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-12-08"}]}
