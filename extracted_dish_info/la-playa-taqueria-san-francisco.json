The usual spots on the way home seemed boring, so the roommate and I decided to get delivery via Postmates. (They were doing a special for taco day, so the delivery fee was only $1.99.) I placed the order at 6:21pm and it arrived at 6:54pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Burrito Super ($9.30): Served with your choice of meat, rice, tortillas, beans, salsa - Refried beans, Carnitas, Hot salsa, Flour whole wheat tortilla (+$0.35), Guacamole (+$0.95), Jalapeno (+$0.75)\n*Carnitas Taco ($2.75): Served with cilantro, onions and fresh salsa\n*Fish Taco ($2.95): Served with baja style with cabbage, gaucamole and pancho sauce\n*Shrimp Taco ($2.95): Served with cilantro, onions and fresh salsa\n*Pollo Taco ($2.75): Served with cilantro, onions and fresh salsa\n*Nachos Regular ($6): Served with melted cheese, Refried beans (on side), Hot salsa, Beef (+$1.50), Cheese (+$0.75), Guacamole (+$0.95), Jalapeno (+$0.75)\n*Chicken Enchilada ($8.25)\n\nI got the four tacos and the nachos. The tacos were a good size. I actually couldn't eat all of them since my eyes were hungrier than my stomach. I ate the shrimp and fish taco that day and had the other two for lunch the next. (Though I did take a bite of each that day for taste purposes.) The fish taco was good. Crispy and I love the cabbage and sauce that came with it. Provided a nice fresh crunchy contrast. The shrimp tacos were okay. It had a good amount of shrimp, but I found them to be a little rubbery. The carnitas taco was good even with reheating. Nice, crispy, fried pork pieces. The chicken one was just all right. I found the chicken a little dry.\n\nI really enjoyed the nachos, but I wanted them to be cheesier. I paid for extra cheese, but I not sure if I got it. If so, then the dish doesn't normally come with much cheese. I did enjoy all the toppings though. The beef had a nice smokey grill flavor. The dish itself had a nice heat from the salsa and jalapenos. The roomie ordered the burrito and enchiladas. He seemed to enjoy them. We also got about four bags of chips and sides of pico. (I think they came with the tacos since I ordered four of them?) I didn't really eat the chips, but I liked throwing the pico on the tacos and nachos to give it an added element of freshness.\n\nOverall, I though their tacos were okay. And priced average at less than $3 each. (Not sure if Postmates inflates item prices, but I don't think they do based on past experience.)
