Their menu is traditional Italian with a twist of Indian infused flavors, along with a traditional Indian menu. \n\nYou have your traditional Italian flavors , food and pizza like the meat lovers called the Brothers Pizza, veggie pizza, spaghetti and fettuccine however then they have these amazing flavorful random pizzas that are completely 5 STARS with good quality ingredients. \n\nI don't know the history behind this place and how they know how to make such amazing Italian food along with Indian food but it sure is good!

They had this tandoor sandwich I had one time under daily specials,  it was so flavorful and the best Indian style sandwich I ever had . \n\nThe Italian food bursts in traditional Italian flavors. You can taste the oregano, parsley,  garlic, thyme and all the flavors that make a good Italian dish. This place is always generous with the spices and ingredients. As far as their Italian food , I've had the fettuccine and eggplant parmesan. You can taste how fresh the eggplant is. So good ! \n\nSide Notes :\n\n* they make everything fresh to order , so yes there will be a wait \n\n* hole in the wall , tiny not so clean looking place \n\n* they have a few tables but majority of the time it's full \n\n* I always place my order 30 mins before arriving, regardless if I'm eating there or getting it to go. \n\n* waking distance to ocean beach \n\n* sometimes I take it to go and we eat at the beach , if your doing this , take hand sanitizer, bunch of napkins , ask them for paper plates and plastic silverware. Be prepared , ocean beach is windy !!! \n\n* they are not customer service oriented , your not going here for customer service  , your going here for the food.
