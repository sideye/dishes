Whipped up velvety smooth with a frothy heaping of rich whip cream on a dark chocolate cookie crust the chocolate mousse was so rich and decadent that it actually made me nauseous, but I couldn't stop eating it until it was all gone.\n\nRealizing this serious caloric intake (or maybe it was just the sugar rush) I laced up the running shoes, grabbed some Hammer Gel and a water bottle and set out on a two and a half hour run through the trails of McLaren Park near my home.  \n\nThrough it all I got rid of the nausea and actually put those extra calories to good use, but by writing this review I just realized I have another slice of Dianda's cake in my refrigerator.  \n\nGawd, it's gonna be a long night ...", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-05-26"}, {"excerpts": ["yesterday and my parent's made me a little bbq on Sunday and to my surprise THE RUM CAKE !", "!

I love cake more than wine, whiskey, cheese, books, breakfast, a parking spot in SF, and the color pink. \n\nThat is a LOT of love! \n\nThe St Honore cake everyone raves about is good. The Italian cherries are lovely, the depth of chocolate is really nice, the boozy levels are too high for me. This is a difficult cake to make for the home baker when you take apart the individual technical merits/skill level you need coupled with the price of the quality ingredients this cake demands. Reminds me of making an Opera cake. Same demands on ones skill, time, and cost per slice. \n\nSOLUTION: BUY IT HERE!! My personal taste in no way reflects badly on the quality. It's definitely there. This is a stunner and others who like punchy obvious flavors in their mouth will love, no, worship this cake! \n\nBut for those of us with refined, discerning taste. Let me steer you to what is easily the most elegant non-European cake I have had the pleasure of eating more than one slice in a sitting.\n\nThe Banana Tres Leches cake. \n\nFresh bananas, wonderfully fluffy whipped cream, cake with a firm but tender crumb (to stand up to the soaking), and a base layer soaked in cream that isn't flimsy/doesn't fall apart. This cake is a visual and gastronomical delight!\n\nThe perfume of fresh bananas, the fatty cream and whipped cream, coupled with the texture of the cake make this the perfect choice for a special event (or if you are like me, a weekday) This doesn't keep so order a size that you will completely finish in a day.\n\nIf all that cake-loving talk wasn't enough praise, the cookies! I love Stella D'oro cookies from the market. I like the circles with pink or white frosting. Cheesy? Yes. Throwback to my childhood? You bet!\n\nThe same flavor can be found in the cookies here. Better quality cookie, more tender crumb, lovely Italian cherries, chocolate, and or nuts grace the individual varietals. Get a pound of cookies, brew some coffee, and take some time out of life to savor your alone time. \n\nI still grab a bag of Stella D'oro's when I see them but let's not tell lies here. That slide out box of store bought cookies pales in comparison to the freshly baked deliciousness the cookie case here boasts. \n\nI just love sweets. My gosh. \n\nI love this bakery. They completely justify my love for cake and everything that requires butter, flour sugar, eggs, leavening, and an oven. \n\nFive stars - well done!\n\nPS: You can phone same day to order a cake for pick-up.

So, if the cake order is simple, you may not have to call in 3 days in advance.

The 3 layers of leche: milk soaked sponge cake, custard, and whipped cream was rich and sweet but the mangos were slightly tart so everything kind of balanced out: http://bit.ly/2FUo5m3. \n\nNot really my style as the soaked sponge cake tastes just like it sounds, like a wet sponge but for those who like tres leches, I'm sure they'll feel differently. My co-workers said, they liked it (or maybe they didn't want to hurt my feelings).   \n\nFor cakes, my preferences are Fancy Wheat Field Bakery (San Bruno Avenue), Schubert's (Clement Street), Ambrosia Bakery (Ocean Avenue), and Tartine (Guerrero Street).\n\nThey spelled our intern's name wrong so I suggest asking them to repeat the spelling twice just to make extra sure. \n\nIf anyone has another recs from Dianda's, kindly send them along.

I love Stella D'oro cookies from the market. I like the circles with pink or white frosting. Cheesy? Yes. Throwback to my childhood? You bet!\n\nThe same flavor can be found in the cookies here. Better quality cookie, more tender crumb, lovely Italian cherries, chocolate, and or nuts grace the individual varietals. Get a pound of cookies, brew some coffee, and take some time out of life to savor your alone time. \n\nI still grab a bag of Stella D'oro's when I see them but let's not tell lies here. That slide out box of store bought cookies pales in comparison to the freshly baked deliciousness the cookie case here boasts. \n\nI just love sweets. My gosh. \n\nI love this bakery. They completely justify my love for cake and everything that requires butter, flour sugar, eggs, leavening, and an oven. \n\nFive stars - well done!\n\nPS: You can phone same day to order a cake for pick-up. My family did.

They also sell Cannoli's, slices of cakes, Tiramisu, cream puffs called \"the clam\", almond torte, and cream horns.  During Easter, they even sell the wonderful Hot Cross buns. If there's a word that could describe something much more than DECADENT and/or SCRUMPTIOUS, Please tell me.... Because that would describe Diandra's.  Forget Schubert's or Victoria Pastry....  Diandra's is truly a GEM!  \n\nYES they are expensive, the ladies behind the counter ROCK. But ohhhhhh... So worth it.\n\nTry it, you won't like it..... you'll absoultely LOVE it.

We used to buy everything at their location on Green St in the North Beach and when they closed, we started buying at this location.\n\nUnfortunately, this 30 year tradition ends today. My mother called me last week to ask me what kind of cake I wanted for my birthday this year and I specifically asked for a chocolate cake with strawberries from Dianda's.\n\nMy mom placed the order on Thursday for pick up on Sunday. She arrived early in the morning only to find out that the cake was not there. Instead of expressing concern and trying to make this right, they all decide to interrogate my mother and treat her like she's an idiot. \n\nFirst they told her that someone already picked it up which was impossible because only 2 people knew that the cake was there, myself and my mom. Then they started interrogating her as if she was lying. They asked her how big the cake was, how many servings it was, how much it was and so on. I mean really? I understand asking what kind of cake but to ask her the rest of the questions was unacceptable. \n\nThen they accused her of placing the order at the San Mateo location. My mom told them repeatedly that she did not. They did not believe her and they called over there anyway and low and behold, no such order was placed there.\n\nThen it finally occurs to them to look at the receipts and it looks like they gave our cake to someone else by mistake. So after over 30 minutes of harassing my mom, they just grab another from the case, write on it and pack it. There was no apology or discount for loosing our cake.\n\nSo a few hours later, here we are getting ready to cut the cake and my mom makes a comment to me that the strawberries look really old and dry so I'm looking at it and I see that the strawberries are moldy. We then cut it open to see and the strawberries are equally as disgusting and they are brown and leaky. So we put all of it back into the box because the last thing I want to do is get sick and we go back to dianda's again. \n\nAlso, there is no way that they didn't see this. The baker actually took the cake to the back to write on so they were fully aware that the fruit was old and moldy but yet chose to still sell it to us.\n\nWhen we get there, my mom begins to talk to one of the ladies. She tells her about the rotten cake and another clerk chimes in and actually says to us that it is no moldy. My mom picks one of the strawberries up so they can take a closer look and one of them actually acknowledges that it is indeed moldy. So the clerk tells me she is going to get me another cake and I tell her that I don't want ANOTHER cake and that I just want a refund.\n\nAnother clerk chimes in and tells me that the manager is not in until tomorrow. I mean really!?! So you want us to come back a THIRD time? I live like 25 minutes away from here and tomorrow is Monday and people work. Also, it's not like I just didn't like the cake and want a refund even though they should refund your money or replace it under those circumstances too. The cake was rotten for God's sake! So that is when I started to talk and get really upset. \n\nI told them that this was unacceptable and that after they lost my cake, harassed my mom for over 30 minutes in the morning that their solution was to replace my lost cake with a rotten one. And that instead of being at home with my family celebrating my birthday, I'm here dealing with them.\n\nAll this time there was an older Italian lady with a really nasty attitude was just listening to what was going on even though I know she is affiliated with the owners and definitely had the authority to give me my money back. Because I was so upset, getting loud and customers were starting to listen, she finally stepped in and literally tossed the money at us and made a snarky remark that she gave us 25 cents more. WOW! 25 cents was totally worth TWO trips across the city, dealing with the difficult parking, having my mom treated poorly for 30 minutes, a lost cake, a rotten cake, ending up with NO birthday cake, having to get really upset before getting a refund, having the money tossed at me like we were a piece of garbage AND me having to take 1.5 hours out of my birthday to deal with this. Thank you so much for your generosity. I don't know what I would do without that extra 25 whole cents. What a bitch!\n\nAfter 30 years of buying a ton of cakes, after recommending them to all my friends and family all of these years and being one of their biggest supporters, it's a shame that it had to end this way. I will never ever step foot in this place again and I have already begun reaching out to my network to tell them what happened to us and that I don't want them buying me and surprising me with anymore cakes from here.\n\nLuckily, I live in SF where bakeries are a dime a dozen.

The top had to have a hard caramel decoration on it but the caramel was not cooked long enough and had a light yellow color.. It literally looked like dog peed on it.. When my husband came home and saw the cake he stayed silent for a moment and then said,  is there another place we can go and buy another cake right now?.. That will give you an idea of the esthetics of it. We actually bought another cake.  Later, after I made some of my own caramel decorations the cake looked more reasonable and we took both of them to the party but I have to say, I will not be back to the bakery. There are so many amazing bakeries in the city and this bakery needs to update the looks of their baked goods. They cakes look a bit too outdated and mass produced.  The flavor was good, but not great. \nI would recommend trying Ambrosia Bakery, Tartine, B.Patisserie.
