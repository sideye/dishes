And lucky for me I live in Inner Richmond, where Chinese restaurants, authentic or not, are abundant.  So naturally I was very excited when my boyfriend told me about this Chinese restaurant he'd found in the Marina and how good their dimsum was.  \"Good Chinese food in the Marina?  Are you kidding me?\"  But the way he raved about the place made me decide to give it a try(let me also add that my boyfriend isn't usually crazy about dimsum - so this was huge)\nWe got to the place and I immediately gave him my first nod of approval when I saw the decor: tasteful, cozy, and very clean.  We started off by ordering a pot of tea(Ging sen oolong, which was VERY good), then looked over the menu: standard Chinese dishes, with a section dedicated to dimsum.  The dimsum menu isn't super extensive, although it does include all the standard items, such as shrimp & chive dumpling, BBQ pork bun, pork suimai, fried turnip cake...  The owner, who was waiting on us, and who was by the way very friendly, told us our dimsum would take sometime to prepare, as they're all fresh-steamed or fried.  No problem.  The fresher the better.  \nWe ended up ordering six dishes(I was really hungry, and plus I am extremely greedy when it comes to trying out new restaurants):\n- shrimp & chive dumplings\n- chicken suimai\n- steamed BBQ pork buns\n- fried turnip cake\n- sweet rice tamale(which is often called \"sticky rice with pork wrapped in lotus leaves\" at other restaurants)\n- pan fried chive dumplings\n\nWe got the shrimp & chive dumplings first, and one bite into the juicy and decadent shrimp & chive dumpling I was sold.
