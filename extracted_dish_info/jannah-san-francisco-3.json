Since the days when his former incarnation, \"YaYa\", shared Michael Bauer's \"Top 100\" Bay Area restaurant list, Yahya has struggled to regain the same hallowed gastronomic attention-hold. Yahya's faded interim fame boldly underscores that restaurateur success does not depend solely on the quality of the end product, which has never faltered. Yahya's flare was declared at Balboa Caf\u00e9 with Jeremiah Tower during its halcyon days, when his, \"Mesopatamia with Californian twist\" fresh-food cuisine was lauded by James Beard, the patriarch of American gourmet cooking. A couple of poor locations, writers' fashion and an intrinsically non self-promoting nature (a skill that did not rub off from Tower) have hampered Yahya's durable recognition. While it is difficult to rise up again, in our opinion, Jannah's - conveniently situated on Folsom between Masonic and Central - is poised to restore justice.\n\nJannah's dishes are loaded with freshness, flavor and flare, and are hand-prepared by the maestro himself with palpable affection. The young waiters are inexperienced but we found them very courteous, attentive and eager to please. Don't be dissuaded by the preposterously low prices. \n\nFor lunch, try the lamb or chicken kebabs with a crisp fresh salad ($9.00). For dinner, the lamb shank was among the best we've tasted anywhere, and truly unbelievable for $12.00. Yahya's kuzi and perdaplow are delicious and unique, and his fesenjoon captures the essence of what made him famous.

Since the days when his former incarnation, \"YaYa\", shared Michael Bauer's \"Top 100\" Bay Area restaurant list, Yahya has struggled to regain the same hallowed gastronomic attention-hold. Yahya's faded interim fame boldly underscores that restaurateur success does not depend solely on the quality of the end product, which has never faltered. Yahya's flare was declared at Balboa Caf\u00e9 with Jeremiah Tower during its halcyon days, when his, \"Mesopatamia with Californian twist\" fresh-food cuisine was lauded by James Beard, the patriarch of American gourmet cooking. A couple of poor locations, writers' fashion and an intrinsically non self-promoting nature (a skill that did not rub off from Tower) have hampered Yahya's durable recognition. While it is difficult to rise up again, in our opinion, Jannah's - conveniently situated on Folsom between Masonic and Central - is poised to restore justice.\n\nJannah's dishes are loaded with freshness, flavor and flare, and are hand-prepared by the maestro himself with palpable affection. The young waiters are inexperienced but we found them very courteous, attentive and eager to please. Don't be dissuaded by the preposterously low prices. \n\nFor lunch, try the lamb or chicken kebabs with a crisp fresh salad ($9.00).

However, the portion was a little small and not particularly filling. We then had two of the phyllo dough entrees--the perdaplow was a dish of little dumplings filled with shredded chicken, rice, almonds, and golden raisins, surrounded by a sweet and tart apricot sauce with peas and chickpeas. The kuzi was a very similar dish, but with a filling of lamb instead. Both were fantastic, with bursts of flavor and crispy exteriors. \n\nNot feeling quite satisfied with just one salad, we then ordered an additional small plate salad--the Jannah salad, which consisted of cucumber, grilled eggplant, and grilled bell pepper. However, the salad was drenched in pomegranate molasses, which was unfortunately sickeningly sweet--it was hard to taste much else in the dish.\n\nOverall, not a bad place for a casual lunch, though I think the overall experience would probably be better for dinner.

After the paper was pulled off the windows and the lights were turned on, my enthusiasm dropped a little bit. The place looks cheap and the lights are way too bright for dinner. But the food is really the most important part of a restaurant, and they do takeout, so I still remained hopeful that it would all end for the best.\n\nLast night the remainder of my hope was brutally killed. I read the yelp reviews and saw the vast majority being positive and raving about the food, except for the lone dissenter, who compared the bread to hot dog buns, but I was skeptical of his review as he stated he is not a fan of middle eastern food. I on the other hand am a fan of middle eastern food, and the food at Jannah is just plain horrible. Some of the worst I've eaten in the bay area. I suspect most of the people who have reviewed it here are either friends/family of the restaurant owner, or part of a religions cult that believes food should be used to punish us for our sins.\n\nOur meal started with the complementary bread, and as another yelper mentioned, it tastes kind of like a hot dog bun. But plenty of places skimp on the bread, so I wasn't too put off. We ordered the salad & hummous for starters. The salad was fine, nothing great, but not bad either, it's pretty hard to mess up a salad. Then the hummous came, which was my first real indication that something was going wrong. The hummous was bland and the pita bread wasn't even as good as the stuff you get in a bag at the grocery store.\n\nFinally we ordered our entrees and that's when the train went off the tracks. We ordered the kuzi (lamb wrapped in phylo) and another dish I can't remember the name of, but was pomegranate chichen of some sort. There was nothing good about either of them. First the presentation: they looked like they came straight out of a can of dog food. just a round lump in the middle of the plate. One came on top of a plate of rice with a few (over)steamed vegetables. Then came the taste, really attrocious. The pomegranate chicken was sickly sweet, and the chicken itself was kind of flavorless. I've had pomegranate chicken before at other places and enjoyed it. The other dish was slightly better, but that's not saying much.\n\nThe food was so bad we couldn't finish our meal, and that's a rare thing for me, I will eat just about anything.\n\nThe one good thing about the place was the staff, they were very nice and the service was just fine. The seem a little inexperienced overall, but made up for that with enthusiasm.\n\nI guess you could say the food is relatively inexpensive, but for what you actually get it's still way overpriced.\n\nIf you are looking for Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern food you will have a much better experience at Ziryab on Divisadero, la Mediterranea on Fillmore, or that place on Haight, which I can't remember the name of right now. The prices are about the same, but much better food.\n\nIf you just want a good, but inexpensive meal in the neighborhood, go to Papalote, or Green Chile Kitchen, or the Vietnamese place on Hayes & Masonic. Any one of those has better and cheaper food than Jannah.\n\nMy last suggestion if you still want to give it a try, just order one entree to start, if you like it you can always order more, but I doubt you will.", "rating": 1, "date": "2009-08-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the Kuzi which with two sweet Salads "], "author": "Eric C.", "review": "The Iraqi snack, kelecha was amazing!

Since the days when his former incarnation, \"YaYa\", shared Michael Bauer's \"Top 100\" Bay Area restaurant list, Yahya has struggled to regain the same hallowed gastronomic attention-hold. Yahya's faded interim fame boldly underscores that restaurateur success does not depend solely on the quality of the end product, which has never faltered. Yahya's flare was declared at Balboa Caf\u00e9 with Jeremiah Tower during its halcyon days, when his, \"Mesopatamia with Californian twist\" fresh-food cuisine was lauded by James Beard, the patriarch of American gourmet cooking. A couple of poor locations, writers' fashion and an intrinsically non self-promoting nature (a skill that did not rub off from Tower) have hampered Yahya's durable recognition. While it is difficult to rise up again, in our opinion, Jannah's - conveniently situated on Folsom between Masonic and Central - is poised to restore justice.\n\nJannah's dishes are loaded with freshness, flavor and flare, and are hand-prepared by the maestro himself with palpable affection. The young waiters are inexperienced but we found them very courteous, attentive and eager to please. Don't be dissuaded by the preposterously low prices. \n\nFor lunch, try the lamb or chicken kebabs with a crisp fresh salad ($9.00). For dinner, the lamb shank was among the best we've tasted anywhere, and truly unbelievable for $12.00. Yahya's kuzi and perdaplow are delicious and unique, and his fesenjoon captures the essence of what made him famous.

When we walked in at 7pm, there were no other customers in there. We ordered the hummus and two of us ordered wine to start. The hummus is only $4, which is the right price, because they don't make their own pita bread and barely give you that much hummus. There was actually a hair in our pita bread, and when I pointed it out to the main host (as our waiter had disappeared), he only took away the hummus and brought back a new one (I guess he didn't understand that the problem was the bread?). Then they brought this other type of bread, with an oily-sesame dip, which was good. However, they didn't knock off the ap which I think they should have done because of the hair. It was a big hair (better than a small one?). \n\nHOWEVER, after this rocky start, it was actually good. I had the vegetarian dolmas, which also included rice-stuffed summer squash and tomatoes.
