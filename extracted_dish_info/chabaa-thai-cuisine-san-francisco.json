The portions were massive, filling, warm, and delicious.  They also arrived quickly, especially for a Friday night.  There was plenty of moist chicken in the Panaeng Curry, and my companion and I cleaned our plates.  The Pad Thai, which had a somewhat small quantity of prawns, was so huge (and we were so stuffed with curry) that we had to package most of it for the next day.  It was still delicious when reheated, unlike the fried tofu.  We will certainly return, especially on chilly, damp evenings.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-01-04"}, {"excerpts": ["The pad thai is seasoned perfectly, always has plenty of chicken and fried tofu, though sometimes I do wish it has a little more peanut flavor, but my boyfriend is always happy with it.  \n\n"], "author": "Loni B.", "review": "If I went to this place to sit down and eat I might have given it 4 stars, but since I always order delivery, and it is honestly the best delivery I can get that isn't pizza, 5 stars it is. The minimum delivery of $20 is only a bummer if you are ordering for only one person.  When ordering for two it usually is pretty easy to hit the mark.\n\nI've ordered a bit here and there from the menu until my boyfriend and I settled on \"the usual\" as we are prone to doing.  Everything we've ever tried from here has always been well prepared and had quality ingredients, some of it just doesn't fit our tastes.  \n\nThe best thing about the food, in my opinion, is that it is consistent.  I hate when the food from any restaurant is really good one day, and then is terrible the next.  Having ordered from Chabaa at least 20 times now, I can say that isn't the case, the food is always just as good as it was the last time I ordered.  \n\nSince it has been awhile since I have ordered anything other than 'the usual', it is the only thing I feel comfortable talking about.\n\nI normally get the yellow curry and my boyfriend, the pad thai, both with chicken.  The yellow curry is really good,not too sweet or spicy.   It has just enough of a kick to make my nose water a bit, which for me is perfect.  The potatoes in the curry are usually undercooked though, I think they've only come fully cooked once, but there is always a good amount of chicken, which is properly cooked.  The pad thai is seasoned perfectly, always has plenty of chicken and fried tofu, though sometimes I do wish it has a little more peanut flavor, but my boyfriend is always happy with it.  \n\nWe also typically get a fried rice, which is the same rice base topped with whatever 'other' you order.  We've tried all the options that don't have pork or beef in them.  By far our favorite is either the duck or the fried chicken, typically there is only one breast/cutlet.  My last personal favorite are the egg rolls, I love the noodles that are inside of them.  My boyfriend really likes the fish cakes.  \n\nThe chicken for everything seems to be the same thinly sliced chicken that looks like it was steamed, maybe poached, I'm not sure.  It isn't tough or anything like that, but it hasn't had time to pick up the flavor of whatever you order it in either, which can make it out of place in some of the soups.  It is always white meat though, which I think tastes better in the food we normally get than dark meat would.\n\nFrom time to time I get the mango with sweet sticky rice as dessert.  The amount of mango it comes with seems to be determined by the season.  When they are in season it comes with a whole, pretty good sized mango.  When off season, usually a half of a large mango or a whole small one arrives.   The sticky rice is flavored very well, not too sweet, and it is wrapped separately.  This is really nice if you are like me and can never eat dessert with your meal because you are always stuffed, but you like your sweet sticky rice warm and your mango cold.  It also comes with a little sweetened coconut milk to pour over everything.\n\nAgain, definitely, by far, the best delivery I've managed to get in my neck of the woods, oh, which is Parkside btw.  Good, consistent food, and the people that run the place are really nice.

I mean, Thai food in general is near and dear to my heart, and I can't say that I've really had Thai food I did not immensely enjoy in all my time in San Francisco.  Should I be so generous with the very first Thai restaurant I review?\n\nSo I thought about the food.  I thought about their tofu satay appetizer with peanut sauce.  I thought about how it was pretty much the heartiest tofu I have ever had, and how it's firm, and chewy, and seasoned just right.  Then I thought about their curries, and all their diverse vegetables just swimming in a thick and creamy sauce.  I thought about how tender the pumpkin is, and how the tofu is soft and melty, so you know they're no one-trick tofu-pony.  I thought about the euphoric gleam in my boyfriend's eyes as he consumed a gigantic plate of spicy, tender pork shoulder (I tried it, you know, just to be sure).\n\nAnd then my thoughts turned to calories, and the devil on my shoulder said \"You know, all that coconut milk and all those pan-fried noodles, they'll catch up with you.\"  But then I remembered that the food at Chabaa is some of the healthiest around.  For so many dishes that are sauteed, everything feels so clean and fresh!  And I thought about how insanely easy it is for me to make healthier choices at Chabaa - almost everything on the menu will be happily turned into a vegetarian dish, and it doesn't feel like a cop out!  The flavors and textures are all still so remarkably intricate that you can really tell they put a lot of care into their food.\n\nSpeaking of which, hey!  I should think about their kind and friendly waitstaff and the way that, even when they're rather busy the food comes out with surprising promptness.  Or about the multitude of space heaters they have, to keep people like me warm in what seems like a sea of perpetually-chilly San Franciscan restaurants.  (Many are cold, but few are frozen.)\n\nAnd then I thought about how we got two entrees (specials, no less!) that yielded leftovers, an appetizer, and a Thai iced coffee for $30.  For dinner.  Yeah.

The service was also exceptional. Genuinely friendly and efficient, they're good at what they do. \n\nThe food is better than most other Thai places we've been to in the city.

Pineapple fried rice was good, and surprisingly not oily like most other fried rice dishes you get at other Thai/Chinese restaurants. Big chunks of pineapple, succulent shrimp, cashews, a hint of curry. I sometimes like a little more curry flavor, but I was ok with this one. BBQ beef was off the Thai menu. Can't remember what it's called, but it's basically bbq beef strips with a spicy tamarind sauce. It was delicious. The beef was so tender but well grilled. Simple, but something that really hit the spot. The spicy tamarind sauce was a good accompaniment, but I thought the menu said it came with rice, but it came with something like a salad with some iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Kind of strange since there's really nothing to eat it with. Still, the beef was really good. \n\nDessert: I don't often get dessert at asian restaurants, but when I see sticky rice and mango, it's hard to resist. We got it and i love the sticky rice, but the mango wasn't that good. Not really ripe enough. But love that sticky rice with coconut milk. \n\nOverall a great choice for Thai food in this area of the outer Sunset.

Hearing that it was very spicy, I ordered it because I love spicy food and green curry, and so together, it should have been a great meal.

My curry was first to come out and I was also given a nice large scoop of rice. My first sip of the curry, I was seeing how spicy \"very spicy\" was. I was actually disappointed. There was some heat, but not enough to be considered very spicy. I added a good amount of dried red pepper flakes into the curry to up the spicy level. The curry had a lot of bamboo, a good amount of green beans, and two medium slices of maybe a quarter of a Japanese eggplant (roughly 1 1/2 inches of eggplant that was cut into quarters and you're only given a half of the eggplant, if that makes any sense). I ordered the chicken, which looking back I regret now. The chicken was a little rough, a little too overcooked and it was not tasty, very tasteless actually. Toward the bottom, the curry became saltier and greasier.

It's worth the gamble, and it's easy enough to scooter across the park myself if I strike out.\n\nVegan Note** They do say they can make some dishes vegan by excluding fish and oyster sauce. Did this once, and I don't recommend it unless you NEED to, or have a magical flavor sauce you plan on adding yourself.

The minimum delivery of $20 is only a bummer if you are ordering for only one person.  When ordering for two it usually is pretty easy to hit the mark.\n\nI've ordered a bit here and there from the menu until my boyfriend and I settled on \"the usual\" as we are prone to doing.  Everything we've ever tried from here has always been well prepared and had quality ingredients, some of it just doesn't fit our tastes.  \n\nThe best thing about the food, in my opinion, is that it is consistent.  I hate when the food from any restaurant is really good one day, and then is terrible the next.  Having ordered from Chabaa at least 20 times now, I can say that isn't the case, the food is always just as good as it was the last time I ordered.  \n\nSince it has been awhile since I have ordered anything other than 'the usual', it is the only thing I feel comfortable talking about.\n\nI normally get the yellow curry and my boyfriend, the pad thai, both with chicken.  The yellow curry is really good,not too sweet or spicy.   It has just enough of a kick to make my nose water a bit, which for me is perfect.  The potatoes in the curry are usually undercooked though, I think they've only come fully cooked once, but there is always a good amount of chicken, which is properly cooked.  The pad thai is seasoned perfectly, always has plenty of chicken and fried tofu, though sometimes I do wish it has a little more peanut flavor, but my boyfriend is always happy with it.  \n\nWe also typically get a fried rice, which is the same rice base topped with whatever 'other' you order.  We've tried all the options that don't have pork or beef in them.  By far our favorite is either the duck or the fried chicken, typically there is only one breast/cutlet.  My last personal favorite are the egg rolls, I love the noodles that are inside of them.  My boyfriend really likes the fish cakes.  \n\nThe chicken for everything seems to be the same thinly sliced chicken that looks like it was steamed, maybe poached, I'm not sure.  It isn't tough or anything like that, but it hasn't had time to pick up the flavor of whatever you order it in either, which can make it out of place in some of the soups.  It is always white meat though, which I think tastes better in the food we normally get than dark meat would.\n\nFrom time to time I get the mango with sweet sticky rice as dessert.  The amount of mango it comes with seems to be determined by the season.  When they are in season it comes with a whole, pretty good sized mango.  When off season, usually a half of a large mango or a whole small one arrives.   The sticky rice is flavored very well, not too sweet, and it is wrapped separately.  This is really nice if you are like me and can never eat dessert with your meal because you are always stuffed, but you like your sweet sticky rice warm and your mango cold.  It also comes with a little sweetened coconut milk to pour over everything.\n\nAgain, definitely, by far, the best delivery I've managed to get in my neck of the woods, oh, which is Parkside btw.

Businesses need to make money after all.\n\nMy fave dishes here:\n-papaya salad - crisp and tart\n-hoi jor - delicious crispiness fused with chewy-inside\n-corn cakes (my friend Natasha H. loves these!)\n-green curry (in my opinion, best green curry in SF, much better than King of Thai's)\n-pad thai/see ew/kee mao -- all good\n\nJust a few tips on ordering at the restaurant:\n* If you want to get curry, get it at lunch because it comes with rice for free.  If you get curry for dinner, you have to pay extra for rice.\n* If you want starch for dinner, get noodles.  Noodles are the same price for lunch and dinner, so you might as well get the noodles for dinner--and the curry (with rice) for lunch.  \n\nThis place opens late--later than most restaurants in the general area (I think like 1-2am on some days?) so it's really great for a late night bite...kind of like back in Asia.  The food has been reliably good at all the different times I've went (lunch, late lunch, dinner, late dinner), so I highly recommend this place to anyone.  This place is a much better \"substitute\" for Marnee Thai, and deserves much more recognition for its fine Thai cooking!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-11-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the green curry with chicken with brown rice as my comparison benchmark this evening.

My curry was first to come out and I was also given a nice large scoop of rice. My first sip of the curry, I was seeing how spicy \"very spicy\" was. I was actually disappointed. There was some heat, but not enough to be considered very spicy. I added a good amount of dried red pepper flakes into the curry to up the spicy level. The curry had a lot of bamboo, a good amount of green beans, and two medium slices of maybe a quarter of a Japanese eggplant (roughly 1 1/2 inches of eggplant that was cut into quarters and you're only given a half of the eggplant, if that makes any sense). I ordered the chicken, which looking back I regret now. The chicken was a little rough, a little too overcooked and it was not tasty, very tasteless actually. Toward the bottom, the curry became saltier and greasier. I am not sure how much oil and coconut milk is used here but it was a very heavy curry. \n\nIf I come back, it will probably be to eat lunch so I don't have to worry about the rice charge.

It's almost like they take your order, send it to the kitchen, put it in to-go containers, and deliver it to you in some hot-bag. I love the quick service, even when you dine in. Large portions for a good deal. Service is very attentive. Interior of restaurant is really nice. Rough, wooden chairs and tables. Dim lighting at night though. Lovely table decor, usually flowers.\n\nMy opinions on the dishes I've tried: \nEgg Rolls - Generous filling with a crispy, flaky outer shell. Delicious, especially with the dipping sauce, I was a little disappointed with only 3 small pieces for $5.25.\n\nAppetizer Combo - Great if you want a variety. You get about 2-4 pieces of each (tofu, prawns in a blanket, egg rolls, fish cakes), which is perfect to split among a small group.\n\nSom Tum (Papaya Salad) - Very tangy and a little spicy, interesting combination of flavors.\n\nPad Thai - Honestly, it didn't blow me away as it has at other Thai restaurants. I found it quite bland.\n\nPad Kee Mao - VERY VERY VERY SPICY! They're heavy handed with the Thai chili. I ask them to not make it milder, but still, it's sooo spicy. Order this dish with caution!\n\nCrab Meat Fried Rice - Good, but very simple with only a few ingredients: crab meat, onion, and egg. I recommend sharing this because it gets boring quickly.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice - Yummm... One of my favorites here! Only four pieces of shrimp is a little stingy though. Very interesting how they put fruit in it, such as pineapples and raisins.\n\nVegetable Fried Rice - Has a good variety of vegetables. I appreciate how they're concerned with customers' restrictions, for example, (if you're a vegetarian) they'll ask you if egg or fish sauce if alright. \n\nI've also tried some of their entrees and curries over rice. Overall, they're really good. Curries are can be a tad runny at times, but definitely have some heat. AND of course, what's a meal at a Thai restaurant without Thai Iced Tea?! Yummy!

Yes, it is one of the most common dishes in all of thai foodom... but damn, does this place do it right. The only place that I've had better pad see ew is in Berkeley at Thai Basil. My friends, who rarely eat Thai, loved this dish as well. They really hit this out of the ballpark.\n\nIn addition, we got yellow curry which was satisfactory but doesn't scream exemplary to me. I would definitely eat it again but it doesn't make me go bonkers like their other dishes.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, we ordered the pineapple fried rice. This is one of the better pineapple fried rice dishes I've had. They include some dried fruits and nuts in the dish, which I found to be weird at first but have learned to embrace and desire it. This dish is definitely tasty and sometimes I even order this instead of #36. \n\nOverall, one of the better thai places in the sunset.

You get about 2-4 pieces of each (tofu, prawns in a blanket, egg rolls, fish cakes), which is perfect to split among a small group.\n\nSom Tum (Papaya Salad) - Very tangy and a little spicy, interesting combination of flavors.\n\nPad Thai - Honestly, it didn't blow me away as it has at other Thai restaurants. I found it quite bland.\n\nPad Kee Mao - VERY VERY VERY SPICY! They're heavy handed with the Thai chili. I ask them to not make it milder, but still, it's sooo spicy. Order this dish with caution!\n\nCrab Meat Fried Rice - Good, but very simple with only a few ingredients: crab meat, onion, and egg. I recommend sharing this because it gets boring quickly.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice - Yummm... One of my favorites here! Only four pieces of shrimp is a little stingy though. Very interesting how they put fruit in it, such as pineapples and raisins.\n\nVegetable Fried Rice - Has a good variety of vegetables. I appreciate how they're concerned with customers' restrictions, for example, (if you're a vegetarian) they'll ask you if egg or fish sauce if alright. \n\nI've also tried some of their entrees and curries over rice.

It was not bad tasting...it was NO tasting.  The pork in the curry did have flavor and was a good texture, but overall very disappointing. \n\nThe Tom Ka was also lacking in the flavor department and was also super oily.  The mushrooms in the soup were oddly spongy and borderline inedible.  There were two sliced tomato pieces sadly bobbing in the broth like lost buoys, but no other veggies were found.

I remembered how hot it was served at the restaurant, perfect blend of flavors, and how well the noodles twirled around my fork for a perfect bite....those were the days! \n\nAnyway so the crushing climatic point of that story is that I'm allergic to shellfish now and found out a year ago, so my dreams of eating pad Thai everyday seemed to be over. So that's background why I don't eat Thai food anymore. I figured I might be bias in this review since you'll see I didn't order anything with seafood (a lot of popular Thai dishes have shellfish ingredients which make their flavors unique and outstanding!)\n\nI came to Chabaa today in attempt to experience some nostalgia of the day I first discovered how much I loved their pad Thai. Was going to eat a little bit literally for the memory of it. While looking at the menu I saw they had a vegetarian pad Thai so ordered that to save my self from anaphylactic shock tonight, the sweet Roti, and the fried chicken over fried rice. \n\nHere's my take: \n\nVeggie pad Thai: a little too sour for me, no fishy sauce flavor which I realize is the best part of the dish. I threw in some chili sauce since there wasn't a kick. No spice no salt...just sweet and mostly sour. It turned out to be just okay after I did that...\n\nFried chicken over fried rice: I've had this at Thai BBQ in South SF before but stopped going there because they started serving really stale rice. I tried the one at Chabaa and it had a nice crunch and seemed to be fried kind of like how sole is fried for fish and chips. The whole time I couldn't convince myself I was eating chicken and I swear it's like I was eating fried fish. The rice was perfect. I can't say this is my fave dish but the crunch makes it worthwhile since I love eating things that are crunchy lol.\n\nSweet Roti: kind of greasy. Just had some sticky (I'm assuming condensed) milk and sugar thrown on. It wasn't really easy to eat, perhaps a little too thick.\n\nI'm not sure if how I feel about Chabaa today is how I felt about them years ago.

Should I be so generous with the very first Thai restaurant I review?\n\nSo I thought about the food.  I thought about their tofu satay appetizer with peanut sauce.  I thought about how it was pretty much the heartiest tofu I have ever had, and how it's firm, and chewy, and seasoned just right.  Then I thought about their curries, and all their diverse vegetables just swimming in a thick and creamy sauce.  I thought about how tender the pumpkin is, and how the tofu is soft and melty, so you know they're no one-trick tofu-pony.  I thought about the euphoric gleam in my boyfriend's eyes as he consumed a gigantic plate of spicy, tender pork shoulder (I tried it, you know, just to be sure).\n\nAnd then my thoughts turned to calories, and the devil on my shoulder said \"You know, all that coconut milk and all those pan-fried noodles, they'll catch up with you.\"  But then I remembered that the food at Chabaa is some of the healthiest around.  For so many dishes that are sauteed, everything feels so clean and fresh!  And I thought about how insanely easy it is for me to make healthier choices at Chabaa - almost everything on the menu will be happily turned into a vegetarian dish, and it doesn't feel like a cop out!  The flavors and textures are all still so remarkably intricate that you can really tell they put a lot of care into their food.\n\nSpeaking of which, hey!  I should think about their kind and friendly waitstaff and the way that, even when they're rather busy the food comes out with surprising promptness.  Or about the multitude of space heaters they have, to keep people like me warm in what seems like a sea of perpetually-chilly San Franciscan restaurants.  (Many are cold, but few are frozen.)\n\nAnd then I thought about how we got two entrees (specials, no less!) that yielded leftovers, an appetizer, and a Thai iced coffee for $30.  For dinner.  Yeah.

Overall, a disappointing meal - while everything looked appetizing, the flavors just did not gel really well at all.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-08-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Pumpkin curry, duck larb, Mango sticky rice are all solid.\n\n"], "author": "Ellen H.", "review": "Pumpkin curry, duck larb, Mango sticky rice are all solid.\n\nAvoid beef Basil fried rice", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-05-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Try the duck larb and the special Thai sausages.
