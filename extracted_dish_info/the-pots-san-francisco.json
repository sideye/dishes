", "It's really sake + water. "], "author": "Elizabeth T.", "review": "I have been here many, many, times, and this is so far my favorite hot pot place in SF.\n\nAwesomeness about it:\n --- all you can eat! for ~$27/person\n --- two broths in one pot\n --- very wide selection of ingredients; meat has better quality than other places\n\nYou should know that:\n --- it get's extremely crowded on nights & weekends. waiting is a bad idea, because hot pot can take 1-2 hours to finish. CALL IN ADVANCE AND RESERVE! Tell them your name, phone number, arrival time, and party size. Then show up at the time, expect there NOT to be a table ready for you yet, but bother the waiters about your reservation, and them being Chinese, will honor the fact that you called, and make it happen soon (my experience is 10 min tops)\n\n --- water & rice: are the two things I never get until I ask twice. it's puzzling to me, because the pot and the rest of the food comes so fast. I think I've been there 10 times, and only once did the rice arrive with me asking for it again (I always mark it on the order sheet).\n\n\nBroth recommendations:\n\n --- pork bone: is the standard hot pot base, can't go wrong with it\n --- spicy miso: is a little spicy and salty \n --- fire hot: is very spicy, and will likely make everything you put in it spicy\n\nSpicy miso & fire hot should both be vegetarian. But double check with them.\n\nStay away from the sake broth. It's really sake + water. I couldn't take it...\n\n\n\nIngredient recommendations:\n  --- meat-wise:  lamb slice, prime beef slice, beef marinated in wine, bork belly, pork intestine (I'm serious, the intestine is amazing)\n\n  --- leaf-wise: crowndaisy/tong ho, napa cabbage, bok choy\n\n  --- balls-wise: beef ball with cheese, shrimp ball with cheese  (be careful when eating, the balls explode!...with cheese)\n\n  --- shrum-wise: enoki mushrooms, black fungus/woodear\n\n  --- fu-wise: fried tofu skin, iced tofu (sweet-tasting), soft tofu\n \n  --- fried yam, fried taro slices (can be eaten immediately or after hot pot-ing)\n\n  --- dessert-wise: dumplings with taro or red bean or sweet egg custard  (NOTE: put these only in clear/pork broth at the end of the meal, take them out immediately after it's done which is confirmed by being able to poke a chopstix through easily otherwise the dumpling might disintegrate)\n\n\n\nDo not get:  \n  --- beef tongue:  it hardens into a leather-y texture, just yucky\n  --- tripe: it may be a good pho companion, but I find it boring in a hotpot\n\n\nThere is no right way to eat hot pot, but here's my general recommendation that ensures a continuous supply of well-cooked food:\n\n1) wait for the broth to boil/bubble before doing anything\n2) put large leafy vegetables in first (tong ho, cabbage) that take longer to cook\n3) put balls and mushrooms next (wait 2-4min)\n4) after the pot reboils with (2)+(3), put in the thin meat slices/seafood/thin veggies (ex: watercress), spread them out with chopstix\n5) as soon as all the meat all turn color (should be fast cuz meats are thin), immediately have the whole table launch eating\n6) IMPORTANT: don't add in more veggies or balls at this time, add in more meat only if you want more food\n7) now the pot should be close to cleaned out, with only broth and some scraps/balls/vegs, now go back to (2) and repeat!\n\nThe reason I do it like this is, leafy vegetables take the longest to cook (and taste terrible if still raw), and meat cooks the fastest (and taste terrible if overcooked). You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min. You should never have to do the pick-the-cooked-one game when eating!\n\n\nHappy HotPotting everyone :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-06-14"}], "spicy miso soup": [{"excerpts": ["I always get the spicy miso soup, and it's so good.

CALL IN ADVANCE AND RESERVE! Tell them your name, phone number, arrival time, and party size.

I think I've been there 10 times, and only once did the rice arrive with me asking for it again (I always mark it on the order sheet).\n\n\nBroth recommendations:\n\n --- pork bone: is the standard hot pot base, can't go wrong with it\n --- spicy miso: is a little spicy and salty \n --- fire hot: is very spicy, and will likely make everything you put in it spicy\n\nSpicy miso & fire hot should both be vegetarian. But double check with them.\n\nStay away from the sake broth. It's really sake + water. I couldn't take it...\n\n\n\nIngredient recommendations:\n  --- meat-wise:  lamb slice, prime beef slice, beef marinated in wine, bork belly, pork intestine (I'm serious, the intestine is amazing)\n\n  --- leaf-wise: crowndaisy/tong ho, napa cabbage, bok choy\n\n  --- balls-wise: beef ball with cheese, shrimp ball with cheese  (be careful when eating, the balls explode!...with cheese)\n\n  --- shrum-wise: enoki mushrooms, black fungus/woodear\n\n  --- fu-wise: fried tofu skin, iced tofu (sweet-tasting), soft tofu\n \n  --- fried yam, fried taro slices (can be eaten immediately or after hot pot-ing)\n\n  --- dessert-wise: dumplings with taro or red bean or sweet egg custard  (NOTE: put these only in clear/pork broth at the end of the meal, take them out immediately after it's done which is confirmed by being able to poke a chopstix through easily otherwise the dumpling might disintegrate)\n\n\n\nDo not get:  \n  --- beef tongue:  it hardens into a leather-y texture, just yucky\n  --- tripe: it may be a good pho companion, but I find it boring in a hotpot\n\n\nThere is no right way to eat hot pot, but here's my general recommendation that ensures a continuous supply of well-cooked food:\n\n1) wait for the broth to boil/bubble before doing anything\n2) put large leafy vegetables in first (tong ho, cabbage) that take longer to cook\n3) put balls and mushrooms next (wait 2-4min)\n4) after the pot reboils with (2)+(3), put in the thin meat slices/seafood/thin veggies (ex: watercress), spread them out with chopstix\n5) as soon as all the meat all turn color (should be fast cuz meats are thin), immediately have the whole table launch eating\n6) IMPORTANT: don't add in more veggies or balls at this time, add in more meat only if you want more food\n7) now the pot should be close to cleaned out, with only broth and some scraps/balls/vegs, now go back to (2) and repeat!\n\nThe reason I do it like this is, leafy vegetables take the longest to cook (and taste terrible if still raw), and meat cooks the fastest (and taste terrible if overcooked). You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min.

The broth tasted like I was drinking cayenne pepper water as there was no depth of flavor to it, much less any flavor at all. There was so much peppercorn that when you cook your meat or veggies, the peppercorn sticks to your food item and you end up having to spit out the peppercorns, chewing on it, or getting it stuck btw your teeth.\n\nIf you're sensitive to MSG, be very careful. My heart started to race almost towards the end of the meal from the broth. And, I ended up waking up to a dry throat the next morning. \n\n*Prime-rib: It was ok. B/c the beef was so thin, it kept on falling apart when you pick it up and ended up breaking apart when you soak it in the broth. It didn't taste like \"prime\" quality as the marbling was just at the tip of the beef so it wasn't as tender as I expected it to be.\n\n*Lamb: Uhhhh, why was the lamb brown?\n\n*Spam: The only flavorful item...it's spam after all and who doesn't love spam?\n\n*Hotlink: It was good as it was store bought; spicy and fatty.\n\n*Meat and Seafood balls: Bleh! Menu claims it was \"homemade\" and the pics on YELP seemed like they were homemade, but the ones we got, looked and tasted like balls from the freezer section.\n\n*Pork and shrimp dumplings: It was good! The pork was moist and flavorful and there was bits of sweet shrimp.\n\n*Mussels: Bleh! Another item from the freezer section. The mussels were chewy and hard.\n\n*Imitation Crab Meat: Ehh, the sticks were served as a frozen clump.\n\n*Ho Fun: Gross! They looked and tasted like pieces of flimsy plastic sticks b/c they were frozen.\n\n*Tofu: It was ok and was one of the only things not  served frozen.\n\n*Deep fried taro: Burnt outside on some pieces while still raw in the inside.\n\n*Spinach: Ummm, at least it was fresh?\n\n*Sauce: They give you a sweet soy which you can add minced garlic, chili sauce, cilantro, and scallions to.

The fried tofu skin starts off crispy but a few seconds in the broth turns into something silky and delicious.\n\nThe egg yolk dumpling is also notable.

They're pretty much as expected, so it's really a matter of what your personal taste is.  We saved the noodles for last and weren't that into them after gorging on all the meat and seafood.

I came here as my friend said it was the best place in SF. With some doubt I came here to try it. We ordered two soups- spicy miso and pork bone soup. The meats come i various marinations, and the beef and wine are okay. I recommend getting the regular beef.\n\nIt's $25/person for it and trust me, Ipot is so much better. (I'm sorry I can't stop comparing this place to ipot. Even boiling in fremont is better too!!) The pot can be two soup but they will charge a dollar each per soup, which adds more to your price. The food is definitely mediocore, and the shrimp paste is better.

Much like with Hot Pot Garden, menu variety certainly isn't lacking - a dozen different soup broths, along with numerous types of seafood, meat, vegetable, meat/fish balls, dumplings, and noodles to choose from (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pots-san-francisco?select=0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q#0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q).  \n\nOn this most recent visit, my friend and I got a split pot with the HK Style Satay and the Spicy Miso (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pots-san-francisco?select=0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q#T9JbIYxdEXfJ8PPIZ5te0A).  I also tried the Fire Sauce on a previous trip here and of the three, the Spicy is definitely the best one.  It's more flavorful than the HK Style Satay and has just the right amount of heat, but isn't as heavy on the spices as the Fire Sauce.\n\nAs for their other menu selections, most are pretty decent, though there are a few things that aren't all that great (particularly the dumplings).  The fishcakes/balls are a little hit and miss (fried fishcake good, lobster ball meh), but the vegetables have all been fresh and the meats (Kobe beef and lamb) have been pretty tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pots-san-francisco?select=0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q#VdIcsG79p75mSjBF0TYeGQ).\n\nWhile The Pot's is a more than adequate substitute until Hot Pot Garden reopens, it should be noted there's a gap between the two.  Both are good, but it breaks down to quality versus quantity.  The Pot's has much more to choose from (12 soups versus 8, more types of meat/goodies), but Hot Pot Garden simply tastes a bit better.  Better Spicy Miso broth, better meat, and better (friendlier) service.  Not that I won't be coming back, especially since the lines are a little shorter...and prices are cheaper ($25 Fri-Sun, $26 Mon-Thurs).", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-08"}, {"excerpts": ["cabbage(unless u like eating a whole iceberg cabbage), and lobster ball.

However, TP and LS are not the same caliber.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/little-sheep-mongolian-hot-pot-san-mateo#hrid:iPv31uVSn4pECBViB7Q5zw\n\nCONCEPT:\nAll you can eat for $22.95 for Mon-Thurs and $24.95 for the Weekend which I think is overpriced considering the poor food quality.\n\nYou get to choose from the original broth, spicy, pork bones, vegetarian, and one other I can't recall. If you want half/half, it's $1 extra per a person which makes NO sense esp when you're paying an all-you-can-eat base price. \n\nThe waiters give you a list, so you can check off the food items you want. They also have Chef Specialties like Sea Cucumber, Duck Feet, Fresh Chicken for an additional fee.\n\nThey bring you your items within 5 minutes, so you can start cooking. You have a 2-hour limit to eat and any items you don't finish, they charge a 20% fee per a person, so don't get too carried away.\n\nFOOD:\n*Spicy Broth: ECK! All heat and NO flavor. Essentially, it was water with chili peppers, peppercorns, fennel and star anise seeds. The broth tasted like I was drinking cayenne pepper water as there was no depth of flavor to it, much less any flavor at all. There was so much peppercorn that when you cook your meat or veggies, the peppercorn sticks to your food item and you end up having to spit out the peppercorns, chewing on it, or getting it stuck btw your teeth.\n\nIf you're sensitive to MSG, be very careful. My heart started to race almost towards the end of the meal from the broth. And, I ended up waking up to a dry throat the next morning. \n\n*Prime-rib: It was ok. B/c the beef was so thin, it kept on falling apart when you pick it up and ended up breaking apart when you soak it in the broth. It didn't taste like \"prime\" quality as the marbling was just at the tip of the beef so it wasn't as tender as I expected it to be.\n\n*Lamb: Uhhhh, why was the lamb brown?\n\n*Spam: The only flavorful item...it's spam after all and who doesn't love spam?\n\n*Hotlink: It was good as it was store bought; spicy and fatty.\n\n*Meat and Seafood balls: Bleh! Menu claims it was \"homemade\" and the pics on YELP seemed like they were homemade, but the ones we got, looked and tasted like balls from the freezer section.\n\n*Pork and shrimp dumplings: It was good! The pork was moist and flavorful and there was bits of sweet shrimp.\n\n*Mussels: Bleh! Another item from the freezer section. The mussels were chewy and hard.\n\n*Imitation Crab Meat: Ehh, the sticks were served as a frozen clump.\n\n*Ho Fun: Gross! They looked and tasted like pieces of flimsy plastic sticks b/c they were frozen.\n\n*Tofu: It was ok and was one of the only things not  served frozen.\n\n*Deep fried taro: Burnt outside on some pieces while still raw in the inside.\n\n*Spinach: Ummm, at least it was fresh?\n\n*Sauce: They give you a sweet soy which you can add minced garlic, chili sauce, cilantro, and scallions to. I used SO much of the sauce b/c the broth did NOTHING to the meat and veggies. \n\nIn short, almost everything was frozen except for the some of the meat, spam, hotlinks, and veggies which is NOT a good sign. \n\nAFTEREFFECTS:\nI'm very skeptical about the TP's cleanliness b/c they had a piece of paper pinned on top of the Health Inspection Score Card, so you couldn't read it. But, really makes me wonder about their food safety practices and freshness of their food, is the \"aftereffects\" my friends and I had. One of my friends, started getting stomach cramps and started to itch before leaving TP. Within 5 minutes of coming home, I went running to the porcelain throne. I BBMed my other friends and apparently they had the SAME experience which is more than coincidental. My friend, John had stated, \"I'm in my fortress of solitude thanks to this place.\"\n\nSERVICE:\nSince it's an \"all-you-can-eat\" establishment, they might as well just make it a buffet type set-up b/c the servers are rude and inattentive. After your first order, they just throw down the plates, they never come to check on you, and don't take your empty plates away.\n\nWe had to ask several times for our Sprite which by the way managed to taste warm even though there was ice in it.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nIt seems TP use to be an old sushi restaurant and it still had the old d\u00e9cor from a sushi bar.

And by \"storm\" I mean, thunder, lightning and seemingly all hell breaking loose. And after all that I of course deserved one, awesome dinner... \n\nFirst of all, it had been awhile since I had Chinese hot pot and I was craving an experience that would catch my taste buds. Leave it to the Sunset district on Judah to give me just that. \n\nWhen I got there it seemed like everyone had the same idea as me because there was about 10 parties of people before us on the waiting list - probably due to both the cold weather and it being around peak dinner time. I think my major issue of this place was that the wait was really long - around 1 hour and a half for my party of 2. The Pot is pretty small and of course at hot pot you would expect entire families and big groups of friends. A couple time during that wait I wanted to give up but the smell that this place gives was a deal breaker. Was the wait worth it?\n\nWhen we finally got a table it was almost their closing at 10. On this particular night they kept the place open for much longer to accommodate people who were waiting for so long. The service was quick - which I can imagine is difficult for a staff so small on such a busy night. The waitresses and waiters were good about checking on us and were all very friendly to me a first-timer.\n\nSo to our POT filled with mild broth and endless possibilities. The thing about hot pot is that your pot definitely is a personalized pot between you and your party, filled with goodies and anything you desire. Since this place is AYCE with a great amount of choices, it definitely expands your creativity. \n\nMy personal favorite items from the menu included: \n- Prime Rib Slice: Excellently sliced and a great quality of meat. :) It was easy for me to finish a whole plate by myself.\n- White Mushrooms: I loved how these mushrooms soaked the broth and gave it a great texture to work with. \n- Rice Noodle: Any noodles are really hard to eat with hot pot due to the difficulty of getting it out of the pot without getting it all over the place - but definitely try an udon or rice noodle to add more substance to your meal.\n- Hot Pot Egg Yolk Bun: This was the PERFECT way to end the meal. It was sweet and after you cook in the broth it just gives it an extra something. I wish I had room to eat about 5 more. \n- Cheese stuffed dumpling: I really can't remember what it was called on the menu but this dumpling was a great little cheese pick me up in between all the fish and shrimp balls we ate that night.\n\nOVERALL, service was great and the food and overall experience you will get at this place is worth the wait.

They have a good selection of spicy and non-spicy broths to choose from.  Since I'm not one for spicy foods but like to truly enjoy the full flavor of all the ingredients, my favorite is the miso broth.  Once you add all the meat, dumplings, meatballs, seafood, noodles, and veggies, you have one darn good tasting broth!  The thin slices of prime rib and lamb are presented perfectly with the right amount of marble, and are very fresh.  The various dumplings, meatballs, and seafood are all tasty.  The even have the black and white fungus, as well as enoki mushrooms!  For the noodles, they have the thin egg noodles, the thin bean thread vermicelli, and the thicker udon noodles.  The texture of all are perfect.  The various greens are very fresh and, when simmered in your broth, very satisfying.  \n\nMy favorite dish, which should be enjoyed at the end of the meal, are the taro balls, a ground piece of light purple taro wrapped in a thin, slightly chewy noodle wrap.  After being heated in the broth for a few minutes, you have a perfectly sweetened ball of DELICIOUSNESS that just melts in your mouth!  An excellent dessert dumpling!\n\nThe prices for this AYCE hot pot are very reasonable:  $23 per person Sunday - Thursday and $25 on Friday and Saturday.  Be sure to only order what you can eat or you will be charged for any wastage.  For entertainment, they even have karaoke for those of you who want to show off your singing talents.\n\nOverall, The Pot's is a great value and with a group a friends, you will not only have an enjoyable, delicious meal but also a lot of fun!

My sister and I had to kind of guess at how to do it, and asked the waiter a couple of questions (but didn't want to look stupid). So if you're a hot pot novice like I was, and ready to try something new and amazing, here's what to expect...\n\n(For anyone who has had hot pot before, this will sound redundant and lame.)\n\nYou get a menu, and just mark off everything you want from each category. Careful though, because you aren't supposed to order more than you can eat - they say they will charge you for leftovers. Assuming you come in a party of two, you each choose a broth (I had the preserved egg and cilantro - delish, and my sister had the spicy miso - also great), and then just mark off everything on the menu that you want, from noodles to seafood to dumplings to vegetables. \n\nI'd recommend starting with one or two noodle orders to share, since you can get more if you don't have enough. There are so many other things to fill up on! There are about 6-8 different types - thin rice noodles, wide rice noodles, soba, egg...\n\nAs far as seafood goes, it's like paradise: there are all kinds of dumplings, filled with everything from shredded crab and spinach, to shrimp, to lobster... They come out uncooked, so you need to put them into the broth for a minute or two (might seem obvious, but I when I got them, I thought maybe they were already ready and were just to be eaten as a side to the soup). There are mussels, prawns, lobster balls...It felt too good to be true. Side note - some of the dumplings just say \"spinach,\" or some other vegetable, but be aware that ALL of the dumpling and wonton options have seafood or meat in them, even if it's not listed. So if you're allergic, avoid them.\n\nThere's a huge list of vegetables - bok choy, eggplant, multiple types of mushrooms / fungus (we tried them all - they were all SO good), yam, taro, spinach, bamboo, soft tofu, fried tofu, radish, lettuce. Probably some I'm forgetting too!\n\nAnother little thing I was unsure about was where to put the food once I'd dipped it in the pot...I was wondering why they didn't bring us little bowls.

You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min.

So I suggest getting all the real good stuff eaten before the broth is re-filled with the water.\n\nOverall we had a great time and definitely got our money's worth. We didn't feel guilty eating all that food either since it's all either seafood or lean meat. And everything's boiled! Best decision we made!

CALL IN ADVANCE AND RESERVE! Tell them your name, phone number, arrival time, and party size. Then show up at the time, expect there NOT to be a table ready for you yet, but bother the waiters about your reservation, and them being Chinese, will honor the fact that you called, and make it happen soon (my experience is 10 min tops)\n\n --- water & rice: are the two things I never get until I ask twice. it's puzzling to me, because the pot and the rest of the food comes so fast. I think I've been there 10 times, and only once did the rice arrive with me asking for it again (I always mark it on the order sheet).\n\n\nBroth recommendations:\n\n --- pork bone: is the standard hot pot base, can't go wrong with it\n --- spicy miso: is a little spicy and salty \n --- fire hot: is very spicy, and will likely make everything you put in it spicy\n\nSpicy miso & fire hot should both be vegetarian. But double check with them.\n\nStay away from the sake broth. It's really sake + water. I couldn't take it...\n\n\n\nIngredient recommendations:\n  --- meat-wise:  lamb slice, prime beef slice, beef marinated in wine, bork belly, pork intestine (I'm serious, the intestine is amazing)\n\n  --- leaf-wise: crowndaisy/tong ho, napa cabbage, bok choy\n\n  --- balls-wise: beef ball with cheese, shrimp ball with cheese  (be careful when eating, the balls explode!...with cheese)\n\n  --- shrum-wise: enoki mushrooms, black fungus/woodear\n\n  --- fu-wise: fried tofu skin, iced tofu (sweet-tasting), soft tofu\n \n  --- fried yam, fried taro slices (can be eaten immediately or after hot pot-ing)\n\n  --- dessert-wise: dumplings with taro or red bean or sweet egg custard  (NOTE: put these only in clear/pork broth at the end of the meal, take them out immediately after it's done which is confirmed by being able to poke a chopstix through easily otherwise the dumpling might disintegrate)\n\n\n\nDo not get:  \n  --- beef tongue:  it hardens into a leather-y texture, just yucky\n  --- tripe: it may be a good pho companion, but I find it boring in a hotpot\n\n\nThere is no right way to eat hot pot, but here's my general recommendation that ensures a continuous supply of well-cooked food:\n\n1) wait for the broth to boil/bubble before doing anything\n2) put large leafy vegetables in first (tong ho, cabbage) that take longer to cook\n3) put balls and mushrooms next (wait 2-4min)\n4) after the pot reboils with (2)+(3), put in the thin meat slices/seafood/thin veggies (ex: watercress), spread them out with chopstix\n5) as soon as all the meat all turn color (should be fast cuz meats are thin), immediately have the whole table launch eating\n6) IMPORTANT: don't add in more veggies or balls at this time, add in more meat only if you want more food\n7) now the pot should be close to cleaned out, with only broth and some scraps/balls/vegs, now go back to (2) and repeat!\n\nThe reason I do it like this is, leafy vegetables take the longest to cook (and taste terrible if still raw), and meat cooks the fastest (and taste terrible if overcooked). You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min.

However, because it's satay and it's a soup base so it will taste extra \"hot\"\n\nTomato Potato Pumpkin - So much as i love the 3 ingredients i actually dislike this soup base the most. I don't know what i was expecting but i think i should've expected it. It was a very tomato-y soup base. It tasted like the tomato soup i would make a home. This was the one soup base where i had to use condiments\n\nMiso base- This was really good, it might be a little on the salty side, but you can actually find tons of seaweed in this broth\n\nCongee- I do not know why this was my favorite soup base of all.  I'll admit, i usually like my congee plain, But it wasn't plain enough where i had to use condiments to eat my meat.  The base had a lot of flavor.  And there was so much rice on the bottom that i didn't even have to order rice to go with my food. By far this is my favorite base\n\nThe meat choices here isn't a large as Hot pot Garden, but it was still enough. I loved the beef balls with cheese. You should wait until this is cooled down before you bite into it, because the cheese can come squirting out and into the eyes of your friend right across from you. ... just kidding.. \n\nThe best items on their menu is the fried taro, yam and pumpkin slices.  It's so much better than the ones at hot pot garden.  Because they fried it, it doesn't melt if you try to cook it in your pot. The yam is fried to the point where it taste like a potato chip to me, i don't even place it on the pot, i just eat it when they serve it.  \n\nBecause i usually get the congee base, i get the red bean bun. It tasted pretty good when you cook it because since the congee don't have a strong taste it doesn't take away from to the flavor of the red bean bun.  \n\nI would recommend coming here before 7 if you have a huge party, they have private rooms here, so i think they take reservations.  The only think i don't like about this place is that when it gets packed getting out of here can feel like a maze because of all the tables and their trays of ingredients.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-11-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage, many variety of tofu, etc.\n\n== "], "author": "Steven B.", "review": "The Pot's has been here for a while.

They refilled water glasses several times without having to be asked, which is always a PLUS for me, especially when I drank 4-5 glasses.\n\nFOOD: \nSoup: Spicy Miso and Pork Bone. Bother very good, very delicious. \nDelicious selection of meat and veggies. They beat HPG in serveral aspects:\n1. They have a larger selection of dumplings. I'm not talking 1-3 choices like at HPG, but they have a whole section for dumplings here.\n2. HPG has fish collars, but the amount of meat on the fish is hit or miss depending on the pieces. The Pot's has lovely fresh fillets of fish. Much better.\n\nAMBIANCE: Modern. Clean. It has several flat screens playing sports. Thank you for having CLEAN bathrooms. Thumbs up.\n\nYou must try The Pot's at least once! The selection will surprise you, even if you're a HPG fan. However, HPG definitely has the edge on alcoholic beverage.\n\nDefintely will return!\n\n-------\nEDIT: Sadly i realized their dumplings ARE frozen. I guess the first time around they were thawed/defrosted properly that I didn't realize it, til the second time around. Oh well, still good, and I'd order them again, but now I know they are frozen just like HPG.\n\nOther things I've tried:\nTheir miso soup base was pretty good, with nice big chunks of tofu, so you can skip on ordering a plate of soft tofu. They have seaweed in it too, which seemed to get in the way of the scooper though. Oh well.

You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min.

They come out uncooked, so you need to put them into the broth for a minute or two (might seem obvious, but I when I got them, I thought maybe they were already ready and were just to be eaten as a side to the soup). There are mussels, prawns, lobster balls...It felt too good to be true. Side note - some of the dumplings just say \"spinach,\" or some other vegetable, but be aware that ALL of the dumpling and wonton options have seafood or meat in them, even if it's not listed. So if you're allergic, avoid them.\n\nThere's a huge list of vegetables - bok choy, eggplant, multiple types of mushrooms / fungus (we tried them all - they were all SO good), yam, taro, spinach, bamboo, soft tofu, fried tofu, radish, lettuce.

It's not the shrimp paste you're thinking... it's basically a lump of ground shrimp and you scoop it into chunks to throw into your broth. It's delicious!! We both love tendon too.. but the ones here are too thin and small unlike Little Sheeps, which are big! It's AYCE so we pretty much stuff ourselves silly: dumplings, beef, lamb, veggies, shrimp, tofu, etc... I love Enoki mushrooms.. (just sharing).

After being seated, we had to make several attempts to wave down one of three waiters working the entire restaurant. After placing our orders, it took about another 15 minutes for the soups to come. However, the meats, veggies, and other stuff did not come with it. The soup sat there boiling for around 20 minutes before the food came.

Good luck waving one down since they have tunnel vision.\n\n== Overall ==\n\nThis place is really really misnamed. It called \"The Pot's\", but it should really be called \"The Wait\".

We decided on trying out The Pot's. As we arrived at the restaurant, I immediately noticed the heavily condensed windows and upon walking in was overwhelmed with a ton of good smelling smells.\n\nWe were seated within five minutes of waiting. We were not sure how the menu worked, so we asked one of the waiters and he was easily able to help us and clear our confusion. We gave a waiter our choices, and let the wait begin. I would say that it took at least 10 minutes for a waiter to bring out our spicy fire soup and turn on our stove and another 10-15 for our food to come afterward. The way my family and I decided to order was to get a bunch of different things, and see which items we would be re-ordering. The plates and plates of food came out and looked very good and fresh, very far from that \"frozen aisle of Asian supermarkets\" appearance. We started cooking everything from the Enoki mushrooms, ramen noodles, Kobe beef slices to the plethora of dumplings that I ordered. The soup was not that spicy but at some times, I definitely felt the heat and sweat building. My absolute favorite things out of all the food choices that we ordered were: the spinach, Enoki mushrooms, \u5c0f\u7c60\u5305 (Xiao long bao), Kobe beef, the fried bean curd and the golden fried dumplings!

We were checked on twice during our dinner and though I don't like that in other and most restaurantes, it was tolerable at The Pot's for some reason. I mentioned on my cons that there would always be something missing whenever we reordered for more. For example, I ordered Xiao Long Bao three times and only received them on the initial menu we ordered with. I didn't look much into it, but I was a little surprised that I never got another xiao long bao after the four I finished.\n\nOverall, besides the steepish price and the slow food refilling, I would DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PLACE the next time I am hunting for hot pot.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-01-26"}, {"excerpts": ["You get your sliced raw pork and beef, your enoki mushrooms and bok choy, you drop them into a pot and have at it.\n\n"], "author": "Louie L.", "review": "I like hot pots.

CALL IN ADVANCE AND RESERVE! Tell them your name, phone number, arrival time, and party size.

You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min.

My bf's sis had a huge craving hot pot since she was feeling sick and told us of this place where it's all-you-can-eat hot pot for around $20-25 and that she really enjoyed it. I had a friend in town so I thought it'd be a great way to kill two birds w/one stone: satisfy my bf's sis' craving and hang out w/a friend of ours. Since my friend eats a lot, I was certain that it would be money well spent as well and boy was I right!\n\nWe went on a weekday so parking wasn't too bad for us (luckily we found parking right in front!) because that area is very notorious for having troubles in finding parking on the weekends (or holidays). The place on the outside really doesn't look like much, but the inside is quite cozy and warm.\n\nThe selection they have is pretty good and fresh. They even have a special menu that you pay for additional items to put in such as scallops, oysters, chicken feet, etc. but unless you have to have them, what they have set for the all-you-can-eat is pretty good to satisfy everyone's tastes. And whenever you need to order more food, you just ask for another menu. After ordering, they bring out the soy sauce (which is slightly sweet and tastes great for dipping) and the basket of condiments to enhance your sauce that consists of red chili sauce, garlic, green onion, and cilantro. You can add as much (or as little) as you want, but be sure to taste and have it the way you like it because they take the basket away as soon as the food arrives.\n\nOk so onto what we ordered. For our broth, we picked the pork bones since that's what we are most familiar with. Our pick for veggies: bok choy and  lettuce (too full to get the chinese broccoli). For noodles we had the bean vermicelli and the taro noodles. Meats were the slices pork and beef. We had one order of hot links but they were too spicy for us (for health reasons we can't eat the stuff). For dumplings we ordered shu mai (which were decent, nothing extraodinary), stuffed shrimp balls (shrimp balls w/fish egg inside), and the custard. Our favorites were the stuffed shrimp balls and the custard dumplings. We had to keep ordering those cuz we all loved them! We also had an order of pork liver, tofu and the enoki mushrooms wrapped w/beef. For dessert we each had a sesame ball w/red bean inside (which is automatically given to you at the end of your meal).\n\nService was alright. It was pretty busy so we had to remind our waiters to bring us the stuff we asked, but they were usually pretty quick. You just gotta keep in mind that they have to juggle a lot of things at a time.\n\nThe only real issue I had was that after you start cooking, and your soup base gets low, they re-fill it with hot water which waters down all the flavors and doesn't taste as good. So I suggest getting all the real good stuff eaten before the broth is re-filled with the water.\n\nOverall we had a great time and definitely got our money's worth. We didn't feel guilty eating all that food either since it's all either seafood or lean meat. And everything's boiled! Best decision we made! Will definitely make another trip when we have friends visiting. ^_^b", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-03-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered a pot of the sichuan spice soup base, enoki mushrooms, fried tofu, tofu skins, bok choy, a couple of other things, and udon noodles.

This AYCE hot pot restaurant is everything that I've been looking for. The restaurant is very modern, clean, and the servers are extremely kind, attentive, and helpful. I came here with a friend this past Friday and from the moment we walked in, we were treated with the uttermost respect. Unfortunately I didn't get the name of our server, but she was just exceptional. She showed us to the sauce station and she was kind enough to answer all of our questions and follow through with all of our requests. \n\nI really felt like this place has a HUGE variety. Not only were there many broth choices to choose from, but there were food options to fit anyone's cravings. We decided to go with the sake broth and the miso broth, however we weren't too big of fans of the sake broth, as it really brought out a bitter flavor. We ended up just using the miso broth side for all of our cooking. \n\nFor meats we ordered the lamb slices, the beef tongue, beef slices in wine, and beef tripe. All the meats were thinly slices & very fresh. \n\nFor the veggies we had the baby corn, spinach, enoki mushrooms, deep fried tofu, and seaweed. \n\nA bonus is that this place has homemade dumplings which are quite delicious. We tried a really big variety and they were all super tasty. Another one of my favorite items was the crispy tofu skin. This was something very different than I was used to tasting, but it turned out to be amazing, especially when dipped with some ponzu sauce. \n\nThe meat portions were very generous, so it's good enough to order 4-6 plates when starting out. In addition, there are a few precooked appetizers, such as curly fries and potstickers which are very good to start with if coming here extra hungry. \n\nThe overall experience at this restaurant was 100%. Not only did I enjoy everything that I tried, but the service was top notch. There was never a longer wait time than 5 minutes. By the time my friend and I were leaving, around 8:30pm, there was a long line of people waiting to get seated. I'm guessing that it gets busy on the weekends and during evening hours. \n\nIf you're looking for a hot pot restaurant that's nice, clean and ready to serve their customers with the best service, this is the place to go.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-10-16"}], "black fungus": [{"excerpts": ["We also loved the black fungus and noodles, as well as nappa cabbage and baby bok choi.

It's hard to get a good broth flavor, so when our good friends invited us to try out their new favorite hot pot place, we had to go. And we were not disappointed.\n\nSERVICE\nWe came in on a Monday night at 7pm and had no trouble getting a table. Our server was so kind and eager to please. He apologized for waits (even though we weren't even waiting) and any slight inconveniences. He was quick with the water, tea, and beers refills. Finished plates were also cleared very quickly.\n\nFOOD\nThe hot pot itself is AYCE (all you can eat), which I've never had before for hot pot. They give you a paper menu to order from. We selected 1/2 spicy broth and 1/2 pork bone. Both were delicious. The spicy was laden with Szechuan peppers dripping red oil, but was not so spicy that people couldn't eat it. There's a little tray of add-ins to your personal dipping sauce -- ginger, onion, peanut sauce, etc. I added all but the chili to mine, and everything I ate was delicious from then on!\n\nAs for what to order, the kobe beef and enoki mushrooms were my personal favorites. The cuttlefish balls, fresh shrimp balls, and mixed meat dumplings were also really good. The flavors were on point and the meat was always tender and soft, never chewy. I was especially impressed with the calamari squid -- it was not chewy at all and I could cut it with my wooden chopsticks! We also loved the black fungus and noodles, as well as nappa cabbage and baby bok choi. And the radish was divine -- it cooks up so soft and warm, and is a perfect complement to the sauce and meats. We ended up going big and getting 4 rounds of ingredients. The staff never once stopped us or made us feel anything other than excited to be ordering more.\n\nWe washed it all down with big bottles of Asahi. They've got a decent beer selection and you can do AYCD (all you can drink) beers for an additional fee ($13 I think, but don't quote me on that). \n\nI loved my experience here and will definitely be back.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["balls-wise: beef ball with cheese, shrimp ball with cheese  (be careful when eating, the balls explode!...with cheese)\n\n  --- shrum-wise: enoki mushrooms, black fungus/woodear\n\n  --- fu-wise: fried tofu skin, iced tofu (sweet-tasting), soft tofu\n \n  --- fried yam, fried taro slices (can be eaten immediately or after hot pot-ing)\n\n  --- dessert-wise: dumplings with taro or red bean or sweet egg custard  "], "author": "Elizabeth T.", "review": "I have been here many, many, times, and this is so far my favorite hot pot place in SF.\n\nAwesomeness about it:\n --- all you can eat! for ~$27/person\n --- two broths in one pot\n --- very wide selection of ingredients; meat has better quality than other places\n\nYou should know that:\n --- it get's extremely crowded on nights & weekends. waiting is a bad idea, because hot pot can take 1-2 hours to finish. CALL IN ADVANCE AND RESERVE! Tell them your name, phone number, arrival time, and party size. Then show up at the time, expect there NOT to be a table ready for you yet, but bother the waiters about your reservation, and them being Chinese, will honor the fact that you called, and make it happen soon (my experience is 10 min tops)\n\n --- water & rice: are the two things I never get until I ask twice. it's puzzling to me, because the pot and the rest of the food comes so fast. I think I've been there 10 times, and only once did the rice arrive with me asking for it again (I always mark it on the order sheet).\n\n\nBroth recommendations:\n\n --- pork bone: is the standard hot pot base, can't go wrong with it\n --- spicy miso: is a little spicy and salty \n --- fire hot: is very spicy, and will likely make everything you put in it spicy\n\nSpicy miso & fire hot should both be vegetarian. But double check with them.\n\nStay away from the sake broth. It's really sake + water. I couldn't take it...\n\n\n\nIngredient recommendations:\n  --- meat-wise:  lamb slice, prime beef slice, beef marinated in wine, bork belly, pork intestine (I'm serious, the intestine is amazing)\n\n  --- leaf-wise: crowndaisy/tong ho, napa cabbage, bok choy\n\n  --- balls-wise: beef ball with cheese, shrimp ball with cheese  (be careful when eating, the balls explode!...with cheese)\n\n  --- shrum-wise: enoki mushrooms, black fungus/woodear\n\n  --- fu-wise: fried tofu skin, iced tofu (sweet-tasting), soft tofu\n \n  --- fried yam, fried taro slices (can be eaten immediately or after hot pot-ing)\n\n  --- dessert-wise: dumplings with taro or red bean or sweet egg custard  (NOTE: put these only in clear/pork broth at the end of the meal, take them out immediately after it's done which is confirmed by being able to poke a chopstix through easily otherwise the dumpling might disintegrate)\n\n\n\nDo not get:  \n  --- beef tongue:  it hardens into a leather-y texture, just yucky\n  --- tripe: it may be a good pho companion, but I find it boring in a hotpot\n\n\nThere is no right way to eat hot pot, but here's my general recommendation that ensures a continuous supply of well-cooked food:\n\n1) wait for the broth to boil/bubble before doing anything\n2) put large leafy vegetables in first (tong ho, cabbage) that take longer to cook\n3) put balls and mushrooms next (wait 2-4min)\n4) after the pot reboils with (2)+(3), put in the thin meat slices/seafood/thin veggies (ex: watercress), spread them out with chopstix\n5) as soon as all the meat all turn color (should be fast cuz meats are thin), immediately have the whole table launch eating\n6) IMPORTANT: don't add in more veggies or balls at this time, add in more meat only if you want more food\n7) now the pot should be close to cleaned out, with only broth and some scraps/balls/vegs, now go back to (2) and repeat!\n\nThe reason I do it like this is, leafy vegetables take the longest to cook (and taste terrible if still raw), and meat cooks the fastest (and taste terrible if overcooked). You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min. You should never have to do the pick-the-cooked-one game when eating!\n\n\nHappy HotPotting everyone :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-06-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I highly recommend the kobe beef, lamb, tongue, shitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, & black fungus were to die for!!!

I often come here with a large group of friends and we always get a private room.\n\nThe AYCE menu consists of a piece of paper which lists the numerous items you can add to your broth, and you just check off and indicate the quantity that you want.  They have a good selection of spicy and non-spicy broths to choose from.  Since I'm not one for spicy foods but like to truly enjoy the full flavor of all the ingredients, my favorite is the miso broth.  Once you add all the meat, dumplings, meatballs, seafood, noodles, and veggies, you have one darn good tasting broth!  The thin slices of prime rib and lamb are presented perfectly with the right amount of marble, and are very fresh.  The various dumplings, meatballs, and seafood are all tasty.  The even have the black and white fungus, as well as enoki mushrooms!  For the noodles, they have the thin egg noodles, the thin bean thread vermicelli, and the thicker udon noodles.  The texture of all are perfect.  The various greens are very fresh and, when simmered in your broth, very satisfying.  \n\nMy favorite dish, which should be enjoyed at the end of the meal, are the taro balls, a ground piece of light purple taro wrapped in a thin, slightly chewy noodle wrap.  After being heated in the broth for a few minutes, you have a perfectly sweetened ball of DELICIOUSNESS that just melts in your mouth!  An excellent dessert dumpling!\n\nThe prices for this AYCE hot pot are very reasonable:  $23 per person Sunday - Thursday and $25 on Friday and Saturday.
