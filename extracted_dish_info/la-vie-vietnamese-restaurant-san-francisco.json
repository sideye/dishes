Furthermore, there was only one other table during prime dinner time.    But I wasn't about to look for another restaurant in the cold, and much of Richmond has been so mediocre for me lately too.   So I gave La Vie a chance. I'm glad I did.   \n\nThe ambiance is simple, just tables and white walls decorated with three Asian instruments on the side walls.  There was also a very elegant Christmas Tree as well--very pretty.  \n\nOur server was a very cheerful and friendly younger Asian gal. She was a great server to have as she offered great recommendations for entrees and for our dessert as well.  I will get to dessert much later.  \n\nFor appetizers, we started off with the Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari.  It came nicely plated with a side of cabbage as well.  The batter for the calamari was a bit thin and minimal, and I would've preferred it to be a bit crunchier.  But the flavor was awesome as it had nice bits of crushed garlic, jalapenos, bell peppers and parsley.  While it was full of flavor, my only complaint about the dish is that there was so much garnish in terms of the jalapenos, parsley, etc, that it made the dish appear larger than it actually was. In turn, there weren't as many calamari pieces given as I would've liked.  http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/OkJ1iRWFNMQepXDC6JyUAg/l\n\nFor entrees, we ordered three dishes.\n\n* La Vie Chicken - http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/1q0cNeZRtyrLDG27fP0iTA/l  Full of flavor, nice and saucy. Dish consisted of coconut milk with curry peanuts basil, cucumber and slices of crispy romaine lettuce.  Everything was equally dispersed and blended very well together; there were also dry chili pieces for that extra kick. \n\n* Green Beans with Radish- http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/JhnlZhp30yEGmQeMKdD9Hg/l  This dish was at the recommendation of our server.  Awesome dish.  Juicy beans lightly cooked in oil, with chopped garlic pieces, and bits of sweet radish as well. I popped these things in my mouth like candy!  \n\n* Garlic Noodles - http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/kjjVV8mo8eYsQGG9H393UQ/l  Unfortunately, not all of the entrees were doing so great.  Garlic noodles were a real disappointment.  My first complaint is that the noodles used are regular spaghetti noodles.  What a bummer! I was expecting them to be some sort of Asian noodles with a bit of a bite to them.   But not the case. Further more, there was not enough garlic flavor, and in stead, there was some Parmesan cheese drizzled on top. This made the noodles a bit dry.  Too bad, because I love love love garlic noodles, but I did not love these.  \n\nDessert!  \n\n* Vanilla Panna Cotta with Mango Puree - http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/y1fv31zLBIi8WXXZl1zdHA/l.  *Licks lip*  Y u m m y !  Our server also made this recommendation to us as well, I'm glad I took it because there were other dessert items that caught my eye...but next time.  As for the Panna Cotta, it was nice and creamy, and had an awesome subtle vanilla taste, not overpoweringly sweet; the mango puree and chopped mango pieces complimented the vanilla very well.  \n\nOur nice server also sent over a complimentary order of a Tiramisu, however, rather than being espresso flavored, it was filled with some sort of Asian fruit, and coconut bits.  I'm unable to describe this dish very well as it wasn't on the menu, and given to us as a comp, but a fruity Tiramisu with coconuts sold me!   \n\nTo sum up, I enjoyed dinner here very much!  The prices are much HIGHER than I normally would've paid for Vietnamese.   I would have like to see a little bit more on the plate in general.  But for the most part all of the dishes made up for the size, in terms of flavor-- With the exception of the Garlic Noodles.  \n\nTotal Bill came out to around $55.00. \n\nI will return.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-12"}], "steam clams  ngheu hap": [], "minced shrimp on sugarcane": [], "bbq pork ball satay  banh hoi nem nuong": [], "la vie combo  banh hoi thap cam": [], "lemongrass grill  nuong vi": [], "beef fondue in vinegar  bo nhoug dam": [], "flaming beef and prawn": [{"excerpts": ["What impressed me most about this place was the Flaming Beef And Prawn .

Did somebody say crab??? A few years ago, some friends introduced me to the Vietnamese Roasted Crab experience. After hearing about the famed Thanh Long (offshoots - Crustacean - SF, Beverly Hills, & Las Vegas), friends raved about the experience. Since we can't jump into the Back to the Future experience and taste what it really was twenty or thirty years ago, I need to talk about the now. \n\nVietnamese Roasted Crab = Perfectly pan roasted crab (timing is critical in ensuring that it is not overcooked - meat sticks to the shell - and flavorful. The crab is quartered (duh, I think one crab serves four) and the gao (aka \"crab butter\", brains, that icky orange stuff that sticks to the main shell) is stir fried in an egg, garlic, ground pork (I believe), and some other mystery seasonings into a scrambled mix. This dish comes with a complimentary plate of garlic noodles (think lightly buttered spaghetti noodles mixed with browned garlic and topped with cilantro) - we usually double up on the noodles. The crab is still warm (not, \"I can't hold this without burning my hand\", hot) while the stir fry mix sits centered on the plate. You mix the garlic noodles with the gao mix and just say \"mmmmmm...\" aka nom nom nom. They later give diners individual lemon tea dipping bowls and paper napkins because they know their crab is finger licking good. Depending on the season, the crab prices can range from $40.00 to $50.00, so this is not for the faint hearted. \n\nAppetizers \n\nLa Vie Combo - Three skewers of grilled shrimp (1 skewer - 3 pieces), bbq pork (2 skewers), and four small imperial rolls with romaine lettuce, mint leaves, pickled carrots, cucumber wedges, and fish sauce. It comes with six individual rice crepes to wrap the above in whatever combination you desire. \n\nCrab meat & Corn Soup - Shredded crab meat and corn in a clear chicken broth seasoned with pepper and garnished with green onions. \n\nMain Courses \n\nCitrus Scallops - Stir fried scallops with zucchini, carrots, oranges, and pineapple wedges, garnished with fried rice noodles and cilantro; doesn't compare to the seared scallops from yesterday.. okay though. \n\nEggplant in garlic sauce - Stir fried eggplant slices with red bell peppers and onions. \n\nClay Pot Special Rice - Seasoned rice with Chinese sausage (lop cheung), chicken meat, shrimp, bamboo shoots, onions, and light ginger flavoring; again, doesn't compare to the Chinese clay pot rice dishes where the rice is perfectly browned as it sticks to the seasoned pot. \n\nThe total bill for four people (including three glasses of Thai Iced Tea) came to $147.00 before tip. We were one of the first to arrive at around 6 pm, as parking can be difficult here. There is a metered lot (in effect until 10 pm) about one block away in case you are unlucky. The dining room was about half full when we left. The highlight is obviously the crab. I've heard numerous complaints about the above mentioned SF crab places, but I can't personally say as I've never dined there. One of the owners told me the difference is that La Vie uses larger crabs in the three to four pound range when available. This is a major difference since no one wants to just suck on a bunch of shells. Whenever my dad is in a down mood or craving for something, the first two words from his mouth is usually, \"La Vie\". Gee dad, I didn't know you spoke French.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-04-18"}]}
