Anyway, this wonderland is more of a culinary adventure, the kind where Alice falls though the rabbit hole and turns into a vegetarian much to the contemptuous disdain of the Red Queen. This spacious place is pretty new with a prime location right at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, and like Eric's in Noe Valley, Wonderland reminds me of Eliza's when it was a good, fresh alternative to all those other Chinese restaurants with their nondescript brown sauces.\n\nI decided to go full-blown veg there and ordered the $9.95 Garlic Meatless Chicken. It was deliciously hearty with big chunks of I-don't-know-what (seitan maybe?) tasting quite savory with a nice texture that really made me not miss the real thing. The meatless chunks were mixed with peppers and leeks, and I just think it's prepared with more panache than you would expect.

Our next favorite was the Szechuan fish - the flavors were good, veggies crisp, and dish void of massive amounts of oil and msg.  \n\nA dish to avoid is the faux-meat Orange Chicken.  While the sauce is pretty good, the fake chicken leaves something to be desired, coming in heavily fried and very uniformly shaped spheres - I would not be surprised if they got the fake meat frozen or canned from May Wah in the Richmond.  I think what really throws the dish off is that each piece has too much fake meat and too little sauce - they need some non-spherical fake meat so that there's more nooks and crannies for the sauce to cling to.  Ahem...a higher surface area to volume ratio, if you will...that's right, I just dropped a little geometry in my review.  \n\nAll in all a decent choice for Chinese but my search continues for a great Chinese restaurant in SF!", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-08-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Szechuan fish is spicy well cooked fish w peapods and jalape\u00f1os.
