How it compares to a hundred other teas?  When it was cultivated and what the actual tea farm looks like?  Haymen, the owner, knows all.   It means a lot to me that I am buying product from someone who has been to the source.  To be clear, this tea room specializes in mostly Asian teas.   When faced with a huge selection with crazy names like Dong Ding, Blue People, and Iron Goddess, Haymen is like a tour guide to exploring all of these wonderful varieties.  I grew up drinking several Chinese and Japanese teas but this place introduced me to dozens I have never heard  of.  For instance, it is amazing to taste each one and realize how drastically different one tea is from another even if they are both green.  \n\nWhen you walk into the shop, you'll notice a marble bar with small stools.  That's the tasting station.  The best part about shopping here is pulling yourself up to a stool and letting Haymen introduce you to new and interesting teas like Longevity Eyebrow.  You can watch him brew the tea, have you smell the leaves both dry and wet, and then taste a small amount.  Have I mentioned that Haymen is hilarious?  He has a great sense of humor and sets a very relaxed atmosphere where you can feel free to socialize with the other tasters and  share opinions. \n\nSince the tea is loose leaf, you can choose to purchase by weight or by price.  For instance, I can choose to buy 2 oz. of a tea or just ask that they give me $20 worth.  \n\nMy favorite tea is the Supreme Taiwan Jin Xuan Milk Oolong.  This tea is so good that I am crazy addicted to it now.

In addition to tea leaves and ready-to-drink tea beverages, Aroma Tea Shop also carries tea pots, cups, trays, filters/strainers, bottles, and other various tea-related accessories.\n\nWhile I'm no tea expert (I'm just a bubble tea simpleton), I can appreciate the sheer variety of fine teas offered at this shop and recommend to anyone who happens to be visiting the neighborhood swing by for a free tasting.

"], "author": "Daniel B.", "review": "Aroma Tea Shop is the place for Asian tea aficionados. It's appropriately located just off Clement Street (San Francisco's other Chinatown) on 6th Avenue. There's a second location in Chinatown. Thanks to Jessica T for introducing us to this place. I've been up and down Clement many times, but haven't explored several of its side streets. This is a unique find and it's been in business since 2005.\n\nAroma Tea Shop's Richmond store amounts to a single room filled with over 150 teas. I believe most of these are loose leaf, stored in canisters. For regular folks, the selection can be overwhelming. The main wall has five shelves filled to the brim. Each shelf contains 24 canisters, tightly lined up. The back wall has an additional three shelves containing about 40 additional canisters. The outside of each canister has an enlarged photo of the actual tea leaves, the food it may taste like, or a humorous picture or graphic.\n\nFor example, the \"Really Fresh Lemongrass\" tea is represented by a photo of lemongrass, the Cherry Rose Sencha tea is represented by a photo of cherries, and the Muscat Grape Oolong tea is represented by a photo of grapes and wine. Playful examples include the \"8 Immorals\" oolong tea sporting the Super 8 Motel graphic, the Yunnan Kung Fu Black Tea using the pixel cover art from the 8-bit Nintendo game Kung Fu, the \"Super Russian Caravan\" black tea using art from Communist Russia, and the popular \"Blue People King Grade\" tea featuring a photo of blue-shirted Best Buy employees.\n\nMost of the teas are sold in 4-ounce increments, though I did see some selling in 2-ounce increments. Tea types include white, green, black, oolong, jasmine, herbal, and pu-erh. Pu-erh tea is an aged and fermented dark tea from the Yunnan province in China. Each tea canister is displayed with a small, helpful information card with details on taste and country of origin. I think most of the teas come from China, Taiwan, and Japan. I did see one from France. Prices run the gamut from $9 to $120 (!) for 4 ounces.\n\nThis is a family-run business headed by the husband-wife duo of Haymen Da Luz and Ying Wu. They make trips to Asia to personally pick which teas to bring back. On a wall inside the shop, there's a giant photo of them at one of the tea leaf farms in Taiwan. There are photos of their two kids too. It's a humble, unpretentious business, unlike some hipster coffee bars or highfalutin gourmet tea retailers.\n\n\"Tea Man\" Haymen is quite the showman. He's a genuinely funny guy and seems skilled at his craft and very knowledgeable about tea. He and his wife regularly conduct free tea tastings at their special custom-built tasting counter. Haymen hosted our group's tea tasting where we sampled the Coconut Paradise green tea, the Muscat Grape oolong tea, the Meng Hai Big Leaf (1990) pu-erh tea, and the Blue People King Grade tea.

"], "author": "Josephine L.", "review": "BREWING THE BAY: Chinese and Taiwanese loose leaf teas, flavored teas (mostly fruity and floral)\n\nFantastic. Place.\n\nI've been to a lot of tea shops in my life and Aroma Tea Shop shattered my highest expectations--so much so that I have a sinking feeling that even IT won't be able to recreate its own amazing first experience the next time I go there. After all, they say nothing is ever as good as your first high....\n\nI could gush and rave about this place to the fullest extent, but then you'd be reading this review until the apocalypse. So instead, I will make use of my (useless) English degree and do my best to SUCCINCTLY convey why this place rocks so hard:\n\n1) It is a classic mom 'n' pop, family-run establishment: Haymen Da Luz and his lovely wife Ying Wu started Aroma seven years ago, and in between growing their family (they have an adorable son and beautiful daughter), they've grown their inventory, space and client base.\n\n2) Haymen: His hilarious, sardonic wit is outmatched only by his extensive knowledge (and obvious love) of tea. He's sarcastic and dry, but never obnoxious, snooty or condescending. Both novices and experts are made to feel welcome as he cheerfully steeps gaiwan after gaiwan of hot tea. When I was there, there was a young Caucasian woman seated next to me who was completely new to the world of tea. She worked at a tasting room in a winery, so her judgment of \"taste\" was skewed completely toward wine. Haymen never once made her feel left out and answered all of her questions with friendly assuredness.\n\n3) The selection of (mostly Chinese and Taiwanese) teas: Aroma packs a lot into a small space. Floor-to-ceiling shelves house large, bright, metal canisters of Asian teas of every varietal, the name and price clearly labeled on each canister along with a bright, colorful picture of the tea leaves. There are also cakes of pu-erh, boxes of flowering teas (perfect gifts for tea-loving friends) and discounted bags of various tisanes (e.g. lavender and rose combos). Which leads me to my next point....\n\n4) FREE, UNLIMITED TASTINGS OF YOUR CHOICE OF TEAS: Unlike the (awful) tea shops in Chinatown that offer a quick gongfu-like preparation of pre-selected, watered-down teas, Haymen encourages his customers to sample as many of the store's teas as they want, free of charge. This means that if you want to try premium oolong that sells for $80/4 oz, Haymen will happily go into the back room, lug out a giant box of tea leaves (the box is as big as a toddler) and steep as much of the expensive oolong for you to drink as you want. Not that anyone would make him do that.....*whistles*. In other, less complicated scenarios, you simply point to a canister and say you want to try that. Repeat until satisfied.\n\n5) The rest of the inventory: Aroma offers a great selection of reasonably priced Chinese and Taiwanese-style teaware. This is the place to go to buy whole gongfu sets or a la carte parts including gaiwans, teapots, brewing trays, tea picks, tea cups and wooden coasters. There are also glass teapots and one-touch tea makers. I found most of the teaware to be of good quality with beautiful colors and designs, in addition to being affordable. You now have no excuse to buy the overpriced teaware of soulless chains like Teavana.\n\n6) The brown frog that changes colors: Ask Haymen to show you if he doesn't automatically offer to. It's cute.\n\nGan Bei! :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-12-01"}, {"excerpts": ["haymen has led me to great green, rose, lavender and jasmine teas.
