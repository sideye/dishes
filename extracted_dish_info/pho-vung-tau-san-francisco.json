We both picked out a vermicelli bowl each (vegetable for me, bbq pork for my partner) as well as an order of fresh vegetable spring rolls. \n\nThe rolls arrived first, as expected.

They were very good and went great with the sauce.\n\nOur bowls came out not long after and I was quite shocked at the volume of food in both! I was also extremely impressed with the vegetable bowl, which was heaped with fried cabbage, mushrooms and tofu. Many places fall short in their vegetable bowls with a few boring vegetables and being very bland on taste, but this was bursting with flavour. I barely needed the extra sweet chili sauce that came with it (although I poured it in to seep through to the noodles underneath).
