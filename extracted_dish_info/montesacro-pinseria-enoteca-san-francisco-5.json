Why yes, yes I am, you jealous Marina and Pac Heights snobs. It's here in SoMa on Stevenson right around the corner from Dottie's True Blue Cafe. And if you expect the neighborhood has gentrified overnight, please remember to fasten your seat belt before returning to your home planet. It's still as cacophonous as ever, but step inside this establishment and you are in Rome near Piazza Navona just coming off your tangerine Vespa. Tall ceilings. Dark wooden cafe tables. Rustic teal chairs, two big ovens in the back encased in subway tile. Ciao, Marcello...Ciao, Sophia.\n\nThe owner is, no surprise, a Roman named Gianluca Legrottaglie, a partner at nearby 54 Mint and a genuinely nice guy as he came to each and every table to thank them for coming. Me included. And if you're wondering what a pinseria is. Well, it's like a pizzeria but not. Unlike pizza, pinsa is made of a mix of rice, soy and wheat flours imported from Rome, and it produces a crisper, flatbread-like crust after it spends mere minutes in the traditional brick oven that actually existed in this space for years unused. I just came on a whim as I usually reserve my pizza eating with Jamie W., but I found this place too hard to resist. The menu is pretty robust with marinated vegetables (sottoli), cheeses, salumi and salads present and accounted for (photo: http://bit.ly/1HvmJM5).\n\nI decided to start with the $10 Cavolo Nero Insalate, a baby kale salad with marinated anchovies, shaved pecorino and drizzled with an anchovy vinaigrette. It came with a bowl, and it was just delicious with the kale nicely massaged and the saltiness of the anchovy just right for the serving which was placed in a glass bowl (photo: http://bit.ly/1Dqr1hh). There are ten pinsas to choose from, and to my own surprise, I went for the healthiest one, the $16 San Lorenzo with tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant and bell peppers, which I was told was the vegan option, and the lightweight crust made it almost gluten-free. Presented on a regular-size platter, it was a rustic shape suitable for solitary diners without leftovers (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ptteju).\n\nIt was absurdly delicioso and fresh tasting with all the vegetables strewn on the top in strips and the crispiness of the crust just right with the char. I didn't even miss the cheese because the fresh tomatoes provided all the lubrication I needed with each bite. It's billed as \"low-fat, low-calorie and easy to digest\" which only made me want to try the other nine pinsas. Some of them looked gorgeous as they passed by. I must have really thought I was in Rome because I decided to have an Espresso (photo: http://bit.ly/1Hze6OW) and the $7 Crostata di Visciole, a slice of the wild cherry tart dusted with powdered sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/1QqOUOH). A tasty treat, and Gianluca was right. You don't feel overstuffed at the end. I didn't want to leave though that had more to do with going back into the land of sirens and unprovoked screaming.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...never had pinsa before and now I'm hooked...what a delicious way to eat a healthier pizza\nAMBIANCE - 5 stars...like a Roman oasis amid the guerilla warfare on Sixth Street\nSERVICE - 5 stars...staff is great, very attentive and Gianluca is my paisan\nTOTAL - 5 stars...such a welcome addition to a neighborhood that really needs a unique eatery like a pinseria", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-04-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The Cavolo Nero (kale, with pecorino cheese and anchovy vinaigrette) will explode any notion you have of tasteless, boring kale salads from other places.

For whatever reason, they had no draft beer so I looked at the bottled beer on the menu focusing on the description and not the price and trying to make a quick decision as the waiter stood there waiting (all the draft beers were $7 or $8 and mentally that's what I assumed the bottled beer would be).   \n\nOur Panzanella salad arrived - tomato, cucumber, red onion, black olive, basil, crouton and red wine vinegar.

The combination of the seemingly weightless crust and the ingredients melding together made for a very enjoyable and tasty flatbread-- I'd definitely recommend to try :)   (Also on a side note, the spicy sausage was not overwhelmingly spicy, it was just hot enough for a slight kick)\n\nService was great, our waitress and I believe the owner checked up on us regularly.  \n\nWhile we didn't have enough time to try their desserts (the show was starting in 15 mins), we'll certainly going to come back again!\n\nIt's located right around the corner from Dottie's, which makes that two great places to eat in the same neighborhood-- I just wish the neighborhood caught up with how awesome this place is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-05-25"}, {"excerpts": ["it's a surprise rapette salads to start and porchetta fresh and tasty \nFor the Pinsa "], "author": "Alessandro B.", "review": "Fantastic people great atmosphere,discover this place yesterday by Italian friends.\nThe food it's a surprise rapette salads to start and porchetta fresh and tasty \nFor the Pinsa I suggest the Centocelle!!!!\nThe only problem it's the location not the nicest and safest.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-04-29"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with a beet salad (Rapette), amazing, fresh and not overly sweet.

I don't pretend to know or understand the difference between pinsa and pizza, but honestly, the food here is good enough to where I know I'm willing to come back and try it again to figure it out.\n\nMy husband and I were fed up with Thanksgiving leftovers and decided that we needed something that looked nothing like turkey and sweet potatoes.  Montesacro had been on my To Try list for awhile now, and knowing that the day after Thanksgiving usually means that restaurants aren't always open, we went with what was available in Montesacro. We made a reservation for dinner and much to my surprise, this place was PACKED.

I know we shouldn't always be in a hurry to eat, but when pinsas are being dished out right behind you and you can't wait to dig into the delicious looking flatbread that's been slathered in sauce, cheese and toppings, it's hard to not want your food ASAP.  Some people complain about the fact that the pinsa doesn't come pre-sliced, but honestly, what's wrong with working for your food just a little bit?

We ordered 3 pinserias for 3 people and were nicely full afterwards.\n\nThe menu is a bit difficult to read as most of the cheeses and cured meat/sausages are named very specifically (examples of cheeses = straciatella, pecorino, burrata, crescenza; examples of cured meat/sausages = 'nduja, guanciale, bresaola) though the servers are very patient and will answer all question you have regarding the menu with a smile. \n\nThe pinsas themselves are very unique, with an emphasis on the bread rather than the toppings. The bread is fluffy with a bit of crunch and is a simple rectangular blob rather than the traditional circular pizza. We had the Casal Bertone (mozzarella + sausage), the Ostia (burrata + fish roe + sunflower sprouts), and another sausage based pizza and the Casal Bertone was hands down the tastiest and most similar to a pizza. We also enjoyed both of the other pizzas and notably the Ostia's purposely tepid temperature combined with the texture of the roe was a very fun and unique food experience. \n\nThe establishment oozes style and while 6th street is awful, this place is a little beacon of hope. It's tucked in an alleyway close to Mission Street with lights strung between the buildings and the restaurant itself is decorated with lots of traditional items that you might find in Italy. In the back is a small deli selling cheeses and cured meats.\n\nService was initially slow and we spent maybe 20+ minutes waiting at our table without anyone bringing drinks, taking our orders or answering questions but when we finally got served, all of the wait staff were patient, helpful, and fun to talk to.\n\nOverall this is a wonderful restaurant that deserves to be frequented often. Its food and flavor profiles are unique and the ingredients are authentic, its pricing is decent for San Francisco, the service is upbeat and fun, and the ambiance is perfect for dates or friends visiting from out of town. While the neighborhood it's located in is terrible, I wouldn't let it stop you from coming over to a wonderful experience. I teetered between a 4 and 5 star review and if the pinsas had been more cheese/sausage and less bread, I would have easily given this place 5-stars.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-07-17"}, {"excerpts": ["(^_^) Nduja (http://bit.ly/2ds5GRs)\n", "Infernetto, w Nduja\n(?", "_?)

Presentation was very nice.\n\nVegetables \"sott'oli\" (3/5) - solid but unremarkable veggies. They weren't crazy overpriced but I'd say just to get it for variety. \n\nCentocelle Pinsa (5/5) - overall the most variety per slice. I found it very flavorful.

This is now on my list of favorite pizza places in San Francisco (I have gone to Flour + Water, Del Popolo, Una Pizza Neopalitana, Il Casaro, Pizzeria Delfina), and I think this one will become my new go-to-pizza spot from now on.

But it's worth dodging all the sketchiness of the area to come here. When you come inside, it's a warm, friendly place that makes you feel like you stepped inside somewhere in Italy. The owner is really nice and came over and talked to us several times and explained the difference between the pizzas that they make here vs. other places. The dough is made up of different types of flours and leavens for 2-3 days. The type of pizza they make is typical of Rome, vs. the other neopolitana pizzas that come from the South of Italy, or the thinner crust from the North.\n\nBresaola salami (3-4 pieces for $6), and it was delicious.

Don't expect anything super cheesy, but for me, it was the right amount of everything and you could really taste the pizza dough.\n\nWe also shared a cherry crostata which was just okay, and a bit on the sweet side for me.

I like that you can make reservations here ahead of time, and that everything is reasonably priced.

Kudos to him for opening this restaurant, which pays homage to his childhood in Italy and memories of its food. \n\nWe started with a well-curated mixed cheese/salumi plate, as well as an order of the house-made porchetta. Gianluca recounted for us how he and his family would travel to the outskirts of Rome on weekends, and stop at food trucks that roasted a whole pig . . .

I've had that before, and it was a safe choice.  I didn't recognize any other wines off their list. [4.0 stars]\n\nFor my PINSA, I got an Maranella -- $21 + $3 for ricotta.  Mozzarella, broccolini, spicy pork sausage, burrata.  I'm so glad I added the ricotta, I don't know if I would have been satisfied with the amount of toppings it normally had. [4.5 stars]\n\nFor dessert, Torta Ghetto -- $7.  A ricotta based, dark cherry, and chocolate.  Nice taste, but very dry.  Wouldn't order this again. [3.5 stars]\n\nIn LA, I recently ate Roman-style PINSA crust and it blew my mind, and honestly, it was better than Montesacro.

We were seated and the wait staff was exceptionally friendly.  We placed our food order and then ordered two draft beers.  For whatever reason, they had no draft beer so I looked at the bottled beer on the menu focusing on the description and not the price and trying to make a quick decision as the waiter stood there waiting (all the draft beers were $7 or $8 and mentally that's what I assumed the bottled beer would be).   \n\nOur Panzanella salad arrived - tomato, cucumber, red onion, black olive, basil, crouton and red wine vinegar.

Reservations are highly recommended as it was pretty full by the time we finished at 6:30 pm.\n\nOn the menu are salads, cheese & charcuterie, and pinsas (beer & wine only). Montesacro boosts to be the only pinseria in the United States to serve pinsa, a roman-style flatbread that came before pizza. They use a blend of rice, soy, and wheat flour that's proofed for 72 hours producing a low-fat and low-carb flatbread.  \n\nMy friend and I started with the Radicchio Salad w/ arugula, bosc pear, forme d'ambert bleu cheese, almonds ($13): http://bit.ly/1RpauEF. Everything was fresh but it was just a very ordinary salad. Next time, I would skip the salad and go for a cheese & charcuterie platter that we were eyeing on other tables.\n\nWe shared two pinsas. The first one was the Maranella Pinsa w/ burrata, spicy pork sausage, broccolini ($18): http://bit.ly/1SjSCrm. Loved the savory sausage and creamy burrata but we weren't keen on the broccolini. Not only did it weigh down the pinsa but it was difficult to take one clean bite without tearing through the fibers of the broccolini or the entire stalk just falling off. Personally, I think shaved fennel would have worked better. But let's talk about that crust...it was lightly crispy, fluffy, and with a subtle chew. So amazingly simple and delicious. \n\nFor our second pinsa, we ordered the special of the night: Imported mozzarella, chanterelles, shaved black truffles ($30): http://bit.ly/1TgASlz. It was love at first bite. The soft, stretchy cheese along with the earthy mushrooms, and luxurious shavings of fragrant black truffles on that amazing flatbread was sublime. This pinsa is worth the a trip to the batsh*t craziness on 6th street.\n\nService is very leisurely (read: S-L-O-W). We were one of two tables when we arrived and it took over 40 minutes to get our first pinsa. If you're in a rush, I would go elsewhere. The staff wasn't very warm nor attentive, and I felt our server did the absolute minimum by just taking our order and delivering our food. It would have been nice if she checked in with us at least  one time during dinner but she didn't.\n\nLove the rustic atmosphere of Montesacro so it's great for a casual date; not recommended for large groups but there is one large communal table.

It's also enough like pizza that no one would open a pinsa parlor outside of, say, NY/LA/SF, for fear of being mocked into bankruptcy.\n\nI happen to be a NY/LA/SF kind of woman, and I loved Montesacro, though less for its pinseria designation than for its wonderful food, service, and atmosphere. My husband Matt B. and I were staying in Union Square and walked over for a Friday lunch. It was bustling but not packed, and we got a table right away. Lovely space--high ceilings, natural light, casually rustic Italian deli decor. Service was excellent. We had a very warm, helpful waiter who took great care of us. \n\nWe drank a couple glasses of wine--a Rioja and a Bellone--and enjoyed a splendid, relaxing pinsa lunch. I ordered the maranella pinsa, and Matt got the $15 lunch special--salad, margherita, and espresso. The pinsas were delicious, fresh pies with fluffy, flavorful flatbread crusts. The maranella came topped with stracciatella di burrata, broccolini, and spicy pork sausage. I generally prefer tomato sauce on my pizza, but this was just perfect, the cheese creamy and gooey, the broccolini tender and full of fired flavor. The sausage was spectacular--I dropped a piece on the floor and if I weren't in public, I would have picked it up. (Instead, I mourned it quietly.) The margherita was also great, classic mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza with that pinsa twist. The salad was a nice healthy side, if nothing special. Mixed greens, lightly dressed.\n\nWe finished our meal with the espresso and a mug of chocolate budino. This is not to be missed. It was rich but not so rich it was hard to eat, with a lush, decadent texture and a dollop of thick whipped cream.\n\nI wasn't expecting anything in particular from Montesacro--it was just a place my husband found on Yelp when we woke up hungry. It ended up being one of the most pleasant, satisfying lunches of my year, and I hope to repeat it when I'm back in the Bay.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-12-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I'm very partial to the Maranella, with spicy pork sausage and burrata.

We had a delicious soppressata and our server recommended a dolce treviso to pair with it. I had never heard of that cheese but it was a wonderful buffalo, cow and goat cheese blend.

We ordered 3 pinserias for 3 people and were nicely full afterwards.\n\nThe menu is a bit difficult to read as most of the cheeses and cured meat/sausages are named very specifically (examples of cheeses = straciatella, pecorino, burrata, crescenza; examples of cured meat/sausages = 'nduja, guanciale, bresaola) though the servers are very patient and will answer all question you have regarding the menu with a smile. \n\nThe pinsas themselves are very unique, with an emphasis on the bread rather than the toppings. The bread is fluffy with a bit of crunch and is a simple rectangular blob rather than the traditional circular pizza. We had the Casal Bertone (mozzarella + sausage), the Ostia (burrata + fish roe + sunflower sprouts), and another sausage based pizza and the Casal Bertone was hands down the tastiest and most similar to a pizza. We also enjoyed both of the other pizzas and notably the Ostia's purposely tepid temperature combined with the texture of the roe was a very fun and unique food experience. \n\nThe establishment oozes style and while 6th street is awful, this place is a little beacon of hope. It's tucked in an alleyway close to Mission Street with lights strung between the buildings and the restaurant itself is decorated with lots of traditional items that you might find in Italy.

I made a mental note and then promptly forgot (it's a rather long name too so it's not something you might easily remember). \n\nA few weeks later, my coworkers were chatting about and amazing Pinseria not far from our office that one of my coworkers stumbled upon. Same description, amazing traditional Italian spot in an unassuming alley off a shady TL street. I knew it was the same spot and this time picked up the name. Montesacro Pinseria.\n\nI was just telling my husband that I wanted our next date to be here when I saw my friend on Instagram happened to be hosting a happy hour at Montesacro and I was like - babe, this is destiny. We can eat some pizza and see Meliza. Winning. \n\nWe ended up missing the happy hour but sweet Meliza made a reservation for us (something we didn't know we needed! Thank you Meliza if you ever read this). \n\nAnyway, all of this is a rather long typical SF story of how you find out about an amazing traditional Italian place on an unassuming alley off a shady TL street. \n\nThe decor is a. bit vintage, a bit industrial, and overall stunning in its unique way. We enjoyed cheese the staff recommended to us and pizza. While we waited the owner gave us caprese salad as a kind gesture to us as friends of a friend, which made our hearts melt. It was delicious. \n\nI had the margherita pizza which is my go to when eating at more traditional Italian places. I prefer to taste the flavors in a good crust and fresh tomato sauce that have bells and whistles (I save that for when I want dominos). It was the most I've enjoyed a pizza since I was in Florence itself (I know, I sound like a prick, I am sorry). Really, we had a great time. I told my husband that this was the vision like teenager me had of older me haha :)\n\nWhen I got to work the next day, I told my coworkers who had mentioned it about our experience and recommended it to the ones who hadn't heard the previous conversation. And now, I'm writing this, because I think you should know this place is truly exceptional. You should really try it and when you're done, tell someone about it :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-08-10"}, {"excerpts": ["If you want to try really good pinsa and want to be served by beautiful Italian waiters, then you definitely need to check Montesacro Pinseria out!

Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca is the place to get great charcuteries and salads but their biggest claim to fame is their unique flatbread pizzas which are so fabulous and tasty that each of them comes with their own rolling pizza cutter! Montesacro is named after a small working class neighborhood in Rome, while the restaurant itself takes its inspiration from the classic \"fraschette\" or Italian deli so to speak and they offer these delightful \"pinsa\" which is a modern take on the ancient flatbread that used to be served by peasants of the Roman Empire.  The pizza here at Montescaro with its numerous toppings and rice based and therefore gluten free flatbreads made for a meal of divinity.\n\nBut let's begin a the beginning, so to speak, my friend managed to get great theatre tickets at the nearby Orpheum Theatre, which is literally only a five minute walk away. This restaurant is very hard to find, it's on Stevenson Street, which itself is an alleyway and it's not in the safest area in the town. There's no real big sign announcing the place, just a small sandwich board with an arrow pointing to the entrance. Our four-top table was not in the most ideal location of the restaurant, as we were sat right behind the hostess desk smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. The busier it got at Montesacro ,the louder it got, not to mention the warmer it got. I'm not sure what this restaurant used to be in a previous life, but I can imagine it being some sort of meat or fish market back in the old meatpacking district days, but now that it's firmly ensconced as a restaurant they've still managed to keep that old world ambiance with a number of antiques serving as accoutrements. \n\nEven though we arrived as Happy Hour was just about to end, our server honored their wine deal which was a Schiavo Red Wine for 7 dollars. We ordered four glasses of that and it went down very smoothly and paired perfectly with all of our bites. When my friend wanted a second glass after 6, they made sure to charge her the regular price, so they know what they're doing even as they are slammed with customers. For my starter, I went with the Sott'oli which was a choice of house-marinated vegetables for five dollars each. Out of six choices they had on their menu, I asked our server what were the most popular, she said the mushrooms, zucchine and eggplant, so I went with those options. I loved the roasted eggplants and the armillaria style mushrooms. They were all seasoned well and nicely marinated and there was so much food on that one dish, we easily could have split it between us all. My friend went with one of the insalatas, the crudo di aspargi which featured thinly shaved raw asparagus, wild arugula, English peas, parmigiano reggiano drizzled with lemon dressing, I thought it was a solid, if slightly over-peppered salad.     \n\nThen it was time to pick out our pizzas, again I went with the recommendation of our server, as she said one of the most popular was the Pietralata which featured grated pecorino/ parmigiano, mozzarella, guanciale, a hard boiled organic egg mashed up, and cracked black pepper. I loved how creamy each bite was with all of the cheese on the flatbread, which had a nicely charged crust topped with plenty of those pizza bubbles we all love. The guanciale, which is basically cured Italian pork, provided a tasty bite with each piece of pizza I cut with my pizza slicer. My dining mates had hits and misses with their choices as the Centocelle was another crowd-pleaser filled with plenty of ingredients including mozzarella, tomato, artichokes, mushrooms, olives, a hard boiled egg cut in half and plenty of prosciutto di parma. The pizza was artwork on a dish as all of the ingredients were laid out perfectly on the flatbread. One pizza that missed the mark with our table was the Torpignattara with its olive oil crushed potatoes, string beans, homemade pesto and toasted pine nuts. This vegetarian option looked good on paper and looked even better on the place but once we all tried a bite we all noticed one thing, the potatoes as it was prepared on that flatbread overpowered every bite and shrouded the other ingredients. Since it was basically a mashed potato spread on the flatbread, it seemed to make every bite soggy.   \n\nBut one miss of dinner didn't damper our evening, in fact once we got the bill, our total literally came out to fifty dollars a person including tip and the typical San Francisco health care surcharge, which in this day in age is not a bad deal. I'm so glad I have a new go-to place to eat before I see any show at the Orpheum or Golden Gate Theatres.

Not only did it weigh down the pinsa but it was difficult to take one clean bite without tearing through the fibers of the broccolini or the entire stalk just falling off.

The maranella came topped with stracciatella di burrata, broccolini, and spicy pork sausage. I generally prefer tomato sauce on my pizza, but this was just perfect, the cheese creamy and gooey, the broccolini tender and full of fired flavor. The sausage was spectacular--I dropped a piece on the floor and if I weren't in public, I would have picked it up. (Instead, I mourned it quietly.) The margherita was also great, classic mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza with that pinsa twist. The salad was a nice healthy side, if nothing special. Mixed greens, lightly dressed.\n\nWe finished our meal with the espresso and a mug of chocolate budino. This is not to be missed.

We live in the neighborhood, so we knew where to walk on 6th. Once we got inside the restaurant and sat down, we both felt like we had been teleported out of the TL into some magical kingdom of yumminess. The smells of Montesacro can be noticed from around the corner, and as you approach, it just gets better. We had done our research, so we knew all about the \"pinsas\", but we were not prepared for how delicious they were. \n\nWe started off with a watermelon, basil, feta salad that was perfectly refreshing on a warm afternoon. We followed with the leanest bresaola (think prosciutto but made of beef tenderloin) and the creamiest manchego. The bresaola only came with three pieces, and the manchego wasn't exactly a healthy slice. In retrospect, we should have listened to our waiter and gone with the bresaola carpaccio. The table next to us ordered it and it looked amazing. They also ordered the caprese salad which looked to be a healthy serving as well.\n\nThen, ohhhhh, then came out the pinsa. You can be a brat and call it a pizza, but the difference is truly the crust. A combination of wheat, soy, and rice, it tasted so much lighter to me than pizza dough. We went with the Montesacro pinsa and I confess that I was thrown at first by the ingredients. Straciatella, kale, fermented fish sauce. I had no idea what straciatella was, kale...meh, and fermented fish..forget it. We asked the waiter, he said it was his favorite. Sure it is...fermented what now? \"it's deceiving, you can't even taste fish\" sure, buddy.  But what is straciatella? \"It's the center of buratta.\" So basically, you take little pillows of heaven - buratta - that you extract their inner essence of deliciousness, and throw that on your dough to serve as a sauce. I don't care what they fermented, I was getting that pizza.\n\nTo wrap this up, one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten - hands down the best pinsa I've ever eaten (also the only one).

Very few minutes after we sat, the waiters started bringing food in a deliciously orchestrated sequence of cheeses, breads, salads, fine charcuterie, and then the glorious pinsas which are similar to pizzas but better. The lunch also included one soft drink per person, and they have truly authentic soft drinks there!\n\nEveryone was delighted with the food and the communal experience of not having to choose individual dishes. We simply ate altogether from the foods on the table and chatted all along. \"An Italian family lunch experience\". The stress of the conference disappeared inside the restaurant. At my request, while we ate the waiters slowly proceeded with charging each guest the fixed price of the lunch, which already included taxes and gratuity. When our time was up, the bill was already paid, the full receipt was already in my hands, so we simply thanked everyone and left.

"], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "I have officially found my new go-to place for some delicious bites in San Francisco's South of Market's Theatre District. Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca is the place to get great charcuteries and salads but their biggest claim to fame is their unique flatbread pizzas which are so fabulous and tasty that each of them comes with their own rolling pizza cutter! Montesacro is named after a small working class neighborhood in Rome, while the restaurant itself takes its inspiration from the classic \"fraschette\" or Italian deli so to speak and they offer these delightful \"pinsa\" which is a modern take on the ancient flatbread that used to be served by peasants of the Roman Empire.  The pizza here at Montescaro with its numerous toppings and rice based and therefore gluten free flatbreads made for a meal of divinity.\n\nBut let's begin a the beginning, so to speak, my friend managed to get great theatre tickets at the nearby Orpheum Theatre, which is literally only a five minute walk away. This restaurant is very hard to find, it's on Stevenson Street, which itself is an alleyway and it's not in the safest area in the town. There's no real big sign announcing the place, just a small sandwich board with an arrow pointing to the entrance. Our four-top table was not in the most ideal location of the restaurant, as we were sat right behind the hostess desk smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. The busier it got at Montesacro ,the louder it got, not to mention the warmer it got. I'm not sure what this restaurant used to be in a previous life, but I can imagine it being some sort of meat or fish market back in the old meatpacking district days, but now that it's firmly ensconced as a restaurant they've still managed to keep that old world ambiance with a number of antiques serving as accoutrements. \n\nEven though we arrived as Happy Hour was just about to end, our server honored their wine deal which was a Schiavo Red Wine for 7 dollars. We ordered four glasses of that and it went down very smoothly and paired perfectly with all of our bites. When my friend wanted a second glass after 6, they made sure to charge her the regular price, so they know what they're doing even as they are slammed with customers. For my starter, I went with the Sott'oli which was a choice of house-marinated vegetables for five dollars each. Out of six choices they had on their menu, I asked our server what were the most popular, she said the mushrooms, zucchine and eggplant, so I went with those options. I loved the roasted eggplants and the armillaria style mushrooms. They were all seasoned well and nicely marinated and there was so much food on that one dish, we easily could have split it between us all. My friend went with one of the insalatas, the crudo di aspargi which featured thinly shaved raw asparagus, wild arugula, English peas, parmigiano reggiano drizzled with lemon dressing, I thought it was a solid, if slightly over-peppered salad.     \n\nThen it was time to pick out our pizzas, again I went with the recommendation of our server, as she said one of the most popular was the Pietralata which featured grated pecorino/ parmigiano, mozzarella, guanciale, a hard boiled organic egg mashed up, and cracked black pepper. I loved how creamy each bite was with all of the cheese on the flatbread, which had a nicely charged crust topped with plenty of those pizza bubbles we all love. The guanciale, which is basically cured Italian pork, provided a tasty bite with each piece of pizza I cut with my pizza slicer. My dining mates had hits and misses with their choices as the Centocelle was another crowd-pleaser filled with plenty of ingredients including mozzarella, tomato, artichokes, mushrooms, olives, a hard boiled egg cut in half and plenty of prosciutto di parma. The pizza was artwork on a dish as all of the ingredients were laid out perfectly on the flatbread. One pizza that missed the mark with our table was the Torpignattara with its olive oil crushed potatoes, string beans, homemade pesto and toasted pine nuts. This vegetarian option looked good on paper and looked even better on the place but once we all tried a bite we all noticed one thing, the potatoes as it was prepared on that flatbread overpowered every bite and shrouded the other ingredients. Since it was basically a mashed potato spread on the flatbread, it seemed to make every bite soggy.   \n\nBut one miss of dinner didn't damper our evening, in fact once we got the bill, our total literally came out to fifty dollars a person including tip and the typical San Francisco health care surcharge, which in this day in age is not a bad deal. I'm so glad I have a new go-to place to eat before I see any show at the Orpheum or Golden Gate Theatres. You'll need reservations as it can get really packed at Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca during dinner time.

This is now on my list of favorite pizza places in San Francisco (I have gone to Flour + Water, Del Popolo, Una Pizza Neopalitana, Il Casaro, Pizzeria Delfina), and I think this one will become my new go-to-pizza spot from now on. I almost wish I hadn't come here with my ex because now this will remind me of him, but it's so good that I'll come back over and over again. \n\nThe location is a bit gritty, located on 6th St. Once you turn on 6th St, you'll want to walk very briskly / run - not just because you're anxious to eat good pizza, but because you'll want to escape all the crazies in the area. But it's worth dodging all the sketchiness of the area to come here. When you come inside, it's a warm, friendly place that makes you feel like you stepped inside somewhere in Italy. The owner is really nice and came over and talked to us several times and explained the difference between the pizzas that they make here vs. other places. The dough is made up of different types of flours and leavens for 2-3 days. The type of pizza they make is typical of Rome, vs. the other neopolitana pizzas that come from the South of Italy, or the thinner crust from the North.\n\nBresaola salami (3-4 pieces for $6), and it was delicious. It tasted like high-quality salami, without all the fat.\n\nCollatina ($16) - Buffalo Mozzarella, Rucolo, and Cherry Tomato. This was delicious with big chunks of buffalo mozzarella (no heavy cheese on top of tomato sauce at this place), a generous serving of arugula, and cherry tomatoes. It almost felt like a salad on top of fresh pizza dough. If you love arugula, get this - it's so good and makes you feel slightly healthier because of the arugula.\n\nQuadraro ($17) - Tomato, Red Onion, Pancetta and Pecorino - This has basically tomato sauce, bacon, and a small amount of cheese. Don't expect anything super cheesy, but for me, it was the right amount of everything and you could really taste the pizza dough.\n\nWe also shared a cherry crostata which was just okay, and a bit on the sweet side for me. I wanted to try the Pinsa Nutella, which is basically pizza crust with Nutella (how can you go wrong?) but decided I had had enough carbs for the day.\n\nThis is a much better value than Una Pizza Neopolitana which at $25 a pop (excluding tip and tax) is just highway robbery for pizza, and without trying to hunt down a food truck (Del Popolo) or waiting for an ungodly amount of time (Pizzeria Delfina, Flour + Water). I like that you can make reservations here ahead of time, and that everything is reasonably priced. This is now my favorite pizza place in the city - I waver between telling too many people because I want to make sure I can go whenever I want! I love the two flavors of pizza that I tried and look forward to trying the rest of the menu.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-07"}, {"excerpts": ["This was followed by two pinsas - the Infernetto ($17 smoked buffalo mozzarella, 'nduja) and Quadraro ($17 tomato, red onion, pancetta, pecorino).
