Then, they both stopped, looked at me, and started grinning. As they continued chatting, the lady glanced back at me several times.  \n\nUmmm, ok. This is awkward. \n\nIF I have a booger hanging out of my nose -  tell me, por favor!\n\nAnyhow, El Tepa Taqueria has been here for over a decade and I've passed by so many times but never thought to stop in until yesterday. I just finished my appointment down the block and all I can think of was a burrito. \n\nGallardos is cash only which I rarely carry so El Tepa it was!\n\nMy go-to at taquerias is always a lengua burrito but they don't serve any offal at El Tepa so I decided to order a Tostada Salad w/ al pastor & refried beans ($8.95) and a Watermelon Agua Fresca (L - $2.75). My order also came with a complimentary basket of chips and dibs to their salsa bar: http://bit.ly/2x4qo3B. \n\nWow, is all I can say. I was expecting mediocrity (or worse) because you never hear about El Tepa and they have so little reviews for being in business as long as they have. \n\nThe multi-layer tostada shell was light and crispy, and was layered with refried beans, a generous serving of al pastor then topped with shredded lettuce, crema, cheese, tomato, red onions, and cilantro. The al pastor was well-seasoned and I loved all the fatty, caramelized edges. The refried beans were very smooth though when combined with the al pastor, it's a touch too salty. More lettuce would have helped to balance the saltiness but nonetheless, it was a surprisingly solid tostada salad. I will definitely opt for guacamole next time for an extra $1. \n\nThe accompanying chips reminded me of a less salty and less greasy version of Chevy's chips which are purely addicting IMO. The salsas were on point - I really enjoyed the creamy tangy salsa verde (w/ avocado?) and the smoky orange salsa (reminds me a little bit of La Vic's orange sauce but more robust, smoky, and spicy). They also have two types of pico de gallo, and the spicy version had a good amount of jalapenos for some fiyah. \n\nI washed everything down the Watermelon Agua Fresca which was watered down but otherwise, a good thirst quencher. I would probably skip this next time and just enjoy their complimentary fruit infused water. \n\nThe cashier was friendly and I like that cleanliness seems to be important to them. The salsa bar was well-stocked and very clean. I constantly saw an employee wiping down the tables after a customer left. And, kudos for using compostable [Greenware] cups!\n\nI came after the lunch rush so I was able to find easily seating. As the food options are scant in this part of The Mission, this place seems to be frequented by nearby techies. \n\nOverall, El Tepa is a surprisingly solid taqueria.
