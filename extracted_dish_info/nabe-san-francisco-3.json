For example, stuff that you do not like is automatically cooking inside the pot.  Although, one does not really have to worry about overcooking tofu or mushrooms, the vegetables may get soggy in this manner.  Pros are that you can get whatever you want at once because they will have all cooked at the same time!  \n\nAfter you are done eating, they prepare a type of rice soup.  They ask you what type of broth you want the rice soup to be made in.  Then, they bring out green onions, egg, seaweed, and of course rice.  They add the rice into the broth.  Then they slowly drain the broth until the rice is clearly visible under the broth.  After that, the egg and green onions are stirred into the equation.  Then, this creation is put into bowls and topped with seaweed.  This was definitely my favorite part of the meal.  Dinner and a show?  Awesome.  \n\nWe were so full after the meal.  However, we had to make room for dessert.  Their special is the butter mochi, which is made in house.  I could definitely tell they were proud of it because they asked us what we thought of it.

We decided to do two broths at regular size to taste as much as we can. \n\nHEFER STATS. \n\nKUROBUTA SAUSAGE ($5) - with mustard aioli. Comes with four sausages. The sausages were appetizer size, very very tasty, and it's worth getting to eat while the Shabu Shabu is warming up.\n\nSUKIYAKI ($19/reg) - Wagyu beef, shirataki with warishita broth. They give you a raw egg and this fabulous dipping sauce for the Wagyu. Dip the raw Wagyu beef in the raw egg first, then the Shabu Shabu, then the fabulous dipping sauce... So good!!! Japanese people and their raw eggs rock my socks!!! The sukiyaki is a savory and sweet broth, gives the beef a nice coating of both.

Harusami with dashi broth. We chose a seafood since we already had meats. This is perfect for seafood lovers. All the seafood boiling in the broth married each item and it tasted good. I am not much of a seafood broth person, I love seafood but when seafood mix together in soup the taste then becomes too seafoodish - I'm weird. It was good but rather keep Shabu Shabu all meats/pork if possible. \n\nSURPRISE!!! When you think you're full, they come out asking which broth you liked more and make a porridge out of the leftover broth (trust, you will have left over broth). We chose the Sukiyaki. They mix rice and green union in the pot and explain what they are doing, then pour it in a bowl for you and top it off with seaweed garnish. So good yet so filling. You can pack it up if you like.\n\nBUTTER CAKE AND SESAME ICECREAM - they don't feature their desserts on the menu. They have a few items and an assortment of icecream. I must always end a good meal with dessert, that's just me. Full or not!!! I got to choose so I selected the butter cake and paired it with sesame icecream because the other choices would make it sweet on top of sweet.

Nabe is still a relatively new genre in Japanese cuisine in the US. Of course there are \"shabu shabu\" places, but rarely do you get the genuinely authentic flavors as nabe is supposed to be in Japan.\n\nWe got two large ones to share between 3 people, even though the waitress tried to convince us to get 3. Really, there's no need for that. There are plenty of add-ons for you to, well, add on, to your order. I think you should get as many individual nabe as you want to taste different flavors.\n\nWe got the sukiyaki and seafood yosenabe. Both had different broths. And then we got a bunch of add-ons: veggie plate, shiitake mushrooms, tofu, shungiku. You can also get additional meat and seafood, but I think veggies are essential to nabe, because they impart so much flavor to nabe.\n\nSo the way you're supposed to do this is let the nabe boil. Then start eating the meat. For sukiyaki, they give you a raw egg as a \"wash\" after you cook the meat in the nabe. Since the meat is cut so thinly, you only really need to put it in the boiling broth for a few seconds. And because it's so hot, you dip it in the egg wash and then eat. Let me tell you, the egg makes a world of difference - not only to calm the temperature down, but all add flavor and texture. The meat tastes so much better with the egg.\n\nAs you continue to eat, you might want to bring down the temperature of the heating pad a little if you're not eating meat. Add some veggies and wait for them to be ready. Eat the veggies and then eat more meat. Repeat until you don't have anything but broth.\n\nSignal your server and she'll bring rice over to make zosui. This is an amazing end of the meal extra. Because you've added so much meat and veggies to the broth, the broth is rich with extra flavor that it didn't start with. When you add the rice, it becomes a heavenly porridge. No need to get noodles or other carbs as an add-on. The end of the meal zosui comes with your meal already. It's so much better than noodles because the rice absorbs the broth and all that good flavor.\n\nHot pots are one of my favorite food genres because it can be so flavorful... and FUN TO EAT!

However, the restaurant's name, displayed cleverly with a bold, blue neon lighting against the black exterior, is easily seen across the street, up to half a block away. It's like your calling to come in on a cold day for some yummy Japanese-style comfort food.\n\nWe tried Nabe a few Saturdays ago for an early dinner around 6PM. As newbies, the menu was a little confusing at first. But our server, Nhu, was very helpful explaining how everything worked. Basically, the nabemono sets are portioned per person. They come with the meat, noodles, and vegetables in the broth, all already in a large pot. That pot is brought to your table stove to cook. However, there is one shabu shabu set (beef or pork for choice of meat), which is the only nabemono set that doesn't have the ingredients already in the pot. In other words, you cook it yourself at the table.\n\nWe shared the beef and pork shabu shabu and opted for one regular miso broth and one spicy miso broth (traditional kombu (kelp) in water was the other option for shabu shabu broth). I definitely preferred the beef over the pork. Both meats were very fresh and delicious, but the beef was flavorful on its own that sauce wasn't necessary. Vegetables were fresh and abundant. You're given a generous helping of spinach, cabbage, shiitake and enoki mushrooms, carrots, tofu and kabocha squash. The miso broth was very mild, and the spicy miso definitely had some heat.\n\nI love the idea of using leftover broth for rice porridge, so you're not wasting the broth. The waitress comes over to make it for you. That Saturday night we went, there were only three waitresses in the restaurant, so I give our server credit for doing so much, shuffling back and forth to other tables but still tending to ours. The broth is usually concentrated after your meal, so you can ask for them to dilute it. The rice porridge is a perfect compliment at the end of our meal, keeping us warm before we leave the restaurant and endure the cold night.\n\nNabe is a relatively small restaurant.

I loved the accompanying raw egg that added a layer of creaminess.\n\nSaving the best for last is the Zosui.

I just want to note that the nabemono sets include meat/seafood, noodles, and assorted vegetables paired with a broth. Your meal ends with a Zosui rice soup using the flavored broth from the cooking. Pricing is $18 per person for a regular portion, $22 per person for a large portion.\n\nThey also have a seasonal nabemono winter set called Kamonanban, which includes duck breast and Tokyo negi with Dashi broth, regular $23 and large $28.\n\nOur group of 9 entered the restaurant around 5:30 PM without a reservation, and we were lucky to nab the long communal table in the back. The restaurant can only seat 32, so I would definitely recommend a reservation during normal dining hours. Service is good, with multiple waitresses running around checking on things, refilling water, and asking if the group is ready for the Zosui rice. However, the entire endeavor is a bit time-consuming given the ingredient preparation, table stove heating, and rice porridge finale. Our group was there for TWO HOURS. Crazy.\n\nMy PDC family ordered 2 regular sets: the SUKIYAKI (Washugyu beef with a sweet Warishita broth) and the SHABU SHABU (Washugyu beef or Kurobuta pork with either traditional konbu or spicy miso broth). Our order came with 3 plates, one for each of the meats (15 slices of thinly sliced, beautifully marbled beef: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZwBukC0KhMXJKbmaNfKPFw/l.jpg, forgot to take a picture of the pork, oops) and another for the combined vegetables and udon (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oENOdFCIcUrOqzm1cSXdgg/l.jpg). The vegetable/udon plate came with chopped cabbage, baby spinach leaves, a few slices of squash, two slabs of tofu, enoki mushrooms, a quartered shiitake mushroom, a few carrot pieces in cute shapes, and udon noodles. To be honest, I wish they gave more vegetables because spinach severely shrinks :(\n\nSince the sukiyaki set came with Washugyu beef, we opted for the Kurobota pork in spicy miso broth, per my big's recommendation. When our pot came to our table, the vegetables were already swimming in it (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Zp7qpP_MynVcMIw3wA0TQ/l.jpg). This gave the scallions, mushrooms, tofu, cabbage, carrots, chrysanthemum leaves, and these spotted, slightly-crunchy, translucent noodles more time to cook. We added the meats on par with our consumption; I enjoyed the beef and pork equally :)\n\nRegarding the broths, I definitely preferred the sukiyaki's Warishita. The sweetened soy base adds subtle undertones to the hot pot ingredients, although the spicy miso adds that kick most people enjoy with their meat. The sukiyaki also comes with a raw egg that you crack into a bowl and dip your meat and vegetables in. So strange! I loved the added creaminess hehe. Screw Salmonella.\n\nAfter all is eaten, a waitress scoops out some of your broth and adds in some rice to make this delicious porridge chock full of hot pot flavor. You can choose to split your rice between the two broths or have it half-half. We asked for half-half, and she let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes before returning to stir in the beaten egg, nori, and green onions. I definitely would vouch for the Warishita broth over the spicy miso broth because at the end of the stewing, the savoriness of the boiled ingredients blends harmoniously with the innate sweetness of the broth.\n\nMax 4-way credit card split, and make sure to let them know before the ring things up. Also, they have one bathroom hidden behind a curtain. It has a weird sliding door...\n\nAll in all, I would recommend 2 regular nabemono sets to be shared among 3 people. Both the SUKIYAKI and SHABU SHABU sets were fantastic, although I have a preference for the sukiyaki's broth and raw egg dip.

Unfortunately when we arrived, the table that they thought would leave was still sitting there and ordered another plate... So we had to wait for around 15 minutes before we could get seated. It wasn't the servers fault since we did only call in and of course no promises were made without an reservation. \n\nOnce inside, the restaurant was TINY! There was a long table that ran down the middle of the restaurant with just a few tables on the side. I would've hated having to sit in the middle tables with a bunch of strangers all cramped up. Fortunately, my friend and I were seated in the tables on the side. But let's talk about the space (reason I took off a star)! There was barely any room for anyone to walk through and the servers had a hard time squeezing in between everyone as well.

Towards the end of the meal, a server will ask if you're ready for their porridge that is whipped up on the spot from one of your leftover broths. From there, the server will add a bowl of rice and set the heat to high. After a while, they will add some green onions, turn off the heat, and immediately mix it in with an egg.

We also got a side of rice (one split between the two of us), harusame noodles, tofu, shiitake mushrooms, and duck (the side order of duck which was $16 isn't listed on the menu). They also have the sesame dipping sauce, which we also asked for as well as it isn't automatically given to you. The ponzu sauce was more tart than other places I've been too but I thought it was great. I really liked the flavors of both broths and the pork and the beef portions were pretty decently sized. Though neither of us thought the side order of duck was worth it, it was an interesting try. \n\nThe best part of the meal for me was the zosui rice soup. They take rice, a beaten egg, and green onions and throw it into your broth that you cooked all your food in (in this case we had a choice between miso and kimchi, and we chose miso). They serve it in your individual bowls and top it with nori strips. I didn't really know what to expect but it ended up being very flavorful (even though it was the miso broth and not the kimchi broth) and I ate the whole bowl even though I was pretty full from the main meal. When you get the soup it is BLAZING HOT so take your time eating it... and don't worry if you don't finish everything in the pot! They'll give you the rest in a take-out container.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is what's bringing down the rating to 4 stars. It's a small place and everyone is having hot pot, so of course it was hot and a bit stuffy. When we walked in my dad mentioned that his glasses fogged up, and maybe it's better right when they open, but I thought it smelled kind of sweaty.

Hi Cherylynn! I trust your reviews more than MBauer!\n\nSpeaking of Bauer...thanks a lot buddy for outing what was supposed to be a \"secret\" good spot in your blog today. And now that restaurant thanks you too for so much exposure. The unintended consequence is that now they will get a lot of \"know it all's\", the hipsters who got charged after watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, will now become Hipster dreams of Douchey, bringing their Tila Tequila type Asian girlfriends to show off more sushi knowledge. If you cringed when Carrie's boyfriend in Sex and the City said \"Sake to Me baby\" when she ordered sake, there's more BS in the works. Bauer, why don't you all do us a favor and go to Sawa Sushi instead and stay there :-*( ? \n\nAnyways, I'm just going to throw it out there that maybe 85+% of Chinese and Asian Americans don't understand traditional Japanese hot pot category of food (nabemono). To them, shabu shabu particularly the all you can eat bonanza's (which I affectionately term SHA BOO), Da Been Lo, kuo guo, Little Sheep, etc etc are either all the same to them, and/ or they find shabu shabu bland as hell, and thus require spicy miso broths in their ramen...and now shabu shabu. And of course what hotpot is complete without a sucka MC remix your own jive ass sauce experience. In a world where subtle natural flavors = no flavor, variety is their spice of life, at the expense of what it should really be. Thus crap becomes the norm.\n\nThe essence of something like shabu shabu, should be an emphasis on the season, the seasonality of ingredients (as well as their quality and original taste)...plus having a cast iron hot pot of homey comforting food, to be shared with family or friends, is not just fun, but warms your heart. Spicy miso broth would in essence destroy that essence of original flavor. This is where premium quality beef, boiled in konbu broth, dipped in ponzu with scallions, momiji oroshi or ginger, is sufficient and elegant.\n\nBut not the SHA BOO BS.\n\nSo for Nabe to come in and pretty much do things right, and still give it a unique Japanese feel, right here in a city of wrong (and wrong food), is commendable. \n\nThe interior is certainly interesting....swanky, yet very Japanese. Love the various bottles of sake plastered on the walls, and even the logo \"Nabe\" has that Orenchi-esque vibe to it.\n\nBut us FOB types are really here for the food.\n\nDidn't get a chance to try the other pots yet, but I very much enjoyed the shabu shabu experience here, even though many are recommending the sukiyaki.\n\nHere's what you can expect with a Shabu Shabu here:\n\nIf you are a traditionalist, the kelp/konbu broth is more than just \"traditional water\". There are humongous pieces of konbu in here. Way more than what the competition provides. Or if you have seen the version at Zabu in San Mateo, they throw in a few pieces of seaweed and call it a day, not kelp.\n\nThe plate of mixed veggies you get is of pretty good quality, but if you have more in your party you want to upgrade to extra veggies (combo platter include abura age/tofu pouches, which soaks up the broth), shimeji mushrooms (and king oyster). Ingredients are organic where possible, and this makes a huge difference in the overall experience. \n\nFor pork there are choices of belly or shoulder.... while belly is the popular obvious choice, the shoulder cut is actually quite excellent in its own right. The beef quality here is better than Shabuway (which is better than those SHA BOO house of worship and AYCE AYCDrink excess, like a Roman orgy or Yelp Elite event from 2005).\n\nThe dip sauces have some thought put into it. The ponzu has a strong citrus accent than other places, and default one comes with momiji oroshi (minced grated daikon that has a slight spicy kick) and finely chopped scallions. Still very Japanesey. Didn't try the sesame dip, but it looked good.\n\nEven a bowl of rice in here, tastes like a good Japanese restaurant's prep.\n\nWhile I have yet to try Yosenabe, Sukiyaki, I have no doubt those will be done quite nicely too. Polite, adequate, and good solid service.\n\nMake a reservation before coming, especially on the weekends.\n\nIf this place could do regional Japanese hotpots....ishikari nabe (Hokkaido) or even winter season kanburi (winter yellowtail) shabu shabu in soymilk broth, using organic ingredients (local if still retaining original flavor), this place would be unstoppable. As long as they don't offer ramen burgers, I will continue to come back.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-09-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Good quality shabu shabu/hot pot with a variety of soup bases that should satisfy most people in your party. \n\n"], "author": "Jennifer W.", "review": "Good quality shabu shabu/hot pot with a variety of soup bases that should satisfy most people in your party. \n\nEach person can choose a different \"set\" since they have split pots available.

We had originally been planning on going to Mum's across the street from our hotel in Japantown. But, after hearing where we were planning on eating, my uncle insisted we try here because it's just a million times better than Mum's. \n\nWalked in and first thing we noticed was that the decor is super nice. Very sleek and classy looking (and apparently the guy who designed the place is the same guy who designed my aunt's lounge/club). Waitress is really nice and was very attentive. Probably helped that we got there pretty early for dinner, around 5:30, and the place was still empty. \n\nMenu: Smaller selection, but they do have different broths including a spicy miso broth, plain seaweed broth, and other soy based broths. We went with the traditional broth, just because we prefer getting the flavor from the ponzu sauce, garlic and green onions. No all you can eat, which is kind of a bummer but the food was still pretty on point.\n\nFood: the quality of the meat was obviously way better than Mum's all-you-can-eat. The Wagyu beef was mouth wateringly tender and the selection of seafood was great (coming with salmon, clams, shrimp, etc.) Veggie were pretty standard: 3 different types of mushrooms, napa cabbage, carrots, tofu, spinach, and udon and clear noodles. One interesting thing was the squash. Never tried that, but it was really good as well. They give you the 2 standard sauces, but one thing I didn't like was that they give you the ponzu sauce already made. I like adding as much garlic, radish, and green onions as I like to my sauce. Also, the portions are not that big. I ordered a regular, and still ate half my mom's plate of beef as well as all the veggies on my plate (I also had just come from an oyster happy hour that included 6 dozen oysters, 2 dungeness crab cocktails, and many cocktails between the 5 of us). For the price, I wasn't about to order more. At the end, they make a porridge out of the broth. Isn't really anything special as much as my uncle tries to hype it up. Just rice, egg, and seaweed, made in the broth from our meat. Was pretty plain, so I mixed the ponzu sauce into it to make it taste better. \n\nOverall, I still prefer Mum's all-you-can-eat. Even though the meat quality isn't as good, Shabu Shabu is not that filling so I need much more than the servings they give us. Also, I like eating more veggies and making my own sauce.

It's like two meals in one!\n\nA new hotpot restaurant in Inner Sunset that opened only 3 weeks ago? Hot damn! Cherylynn's review is so thorough that I don't need to bother with all the details. I just want to note that the nabemono sets include meat/seafood, noodles, and assorted vegetables paired with a broth. Your meal ends with a Zosui rice soup using the flavored broth from the cooking. Pricing is $18 per person for a regular portion, $22 per person for a large portion.\n\nThey also have a seasonal nabemono winter set called Kamonanban, which includes duck breast and Tokyo negi with Dashi broth, regular $23 and large $28.\n\nOur group of 9 entered the restaurant around 5:30 PM without a reservation, and we were lucky to nab the long communal table in the back. The restaurant can only seat 32, so I would definitely recommend a reservation during normal dining hours. Service is good, with multiple waitresses running around checking on things, refilling water, and asking if the group is ready for the Zosui rice. However, the entire endeavor is a bit time-consuming given the ingredient preparation, table stove heating, and rice porridge finale. Our group was there for TWO HOURS. Crazy.\n\nMy PDC family ordered 2 regular sets: the SUKIYAKI (Washugyu beef with a sweet Warishita broth) and the SHABU SHABU (Washugyu beef or Kurobuta pork with either traditional konbu or spicy miso broth). Our order came with 3 plates, one for each of the meats (15 slices of thinly sliced, beautifully marbled beef: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZwBukC0KhMXJKbmaNfKPFw/l.jpg, forgot to take a picture of the pork, oops) and another for the combined vegetables and udon (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oENOdFCIcUrOqzm1cSXdgg/l.jpg). The vegetable/udon plate came with chopped cabbage, baby spinach leaves, a few slices of squash, two slabs of tofu, enoki mushrooms, a quartered shiitake mushroom, a few carrot pieces in cute shapes, and udon noodles. To be honest, I wish they gave more vegetables because spinach severely shrinks :(\n\nSince the sukiyaki set came with Washugyu beef, we opted for the Kurobota pork in spicy miso broth, per my big's recommendation. When our pot came to our table, the vegetables were already swimming in it (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Zp7qpP_MynVcMIw3wA0TQ/l.jpg). This gave the scallions, mushrooms, tofu, cabbage, carrots, chrysanthemum leaves, and these spotted, slightly-crunchy, translucent noodles more time to cook. We added the meats on par with our consumption; I enjoyed the beef and pork equally :)\n\nRegarding the broths, I definitely preferred the sukiyaki's Warishita. The sweetened soy base adds subtle undertones to the hot pot ingredients, although the spicy miso adds that kick most people enjoy with their meat. The sukiyaki also comes with a raw egg that you crack into a bowl and dip your meat and vegetables in. So strange! I loved the added creaminess hehe. Screw Salmonella.\n\nAfter all is eaten, a waitress scoops out some of your broth and adds in some rice to make this delicious porridge chock full of hot pot flavor. You can choose to split your rice between the two broths or have it half-half. We asked for half-half, and she let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes before returning to stir in the beaten egg, nori, and green onions. I definitely would vouch for the Warishita broth over the spicy miso broth because at the end of the stewing, the savoriness of the boiled ingredients blends harmoniously with the innate sweetness of the broth.\n\nMax 4-way credit card split, and make sure to let them know before the ring things up. Also, they have one bathroom hidden behind a curtain. It has a weird sliding door...\n\nAll in all, I would recommend 2 regular nabemono sets to be shared among 3 people. Both the SUKIYAKI and SHABU SHABU sets were fantastic, although I have a preference for the sukiyaki's broth and raw egg dip. I liked both the beef and the pork, and the beef is exceptionally marbled. And don't forget the Zosui rice porridge at the end!

Towards the end of the meal, a server will ask if you're ready for their porridge that is whipped up on the spot from one of your leftover broths. From there, the server will add a bowl of rice and set the heat to high. After a while, they will add some green onions, turn off the heat, and immediately mix it in with an egg. The end result is a nice, thick creamy consistency topped off with some shredded seaweed and voila, porridge is served! What an AMAZING and smart way to use up the remainder of the pot.

They do shabu a bit different here, they call it Nabemono but its practically the same thing.  Most shabu restaurants I've been to usually bring out the soup and the uncooked ingredients on a plate.  At Nabe they already put everything in the pot, with the flavored broth.  They do have one dish, called Shabu, where you do put the ingredients in yourself.  The food was excellent, the thinly sliced washugyu beef was very tender and flavorful.  We also had an order of the seafood mix which had a great variety of seafood options which included salmon, clams, shrimp and scallops.  The seasonal special was a duck breast which was very good but be sure not to cook the duck too long, the water can boil quick and the duck can get over cooked.

It also came with a small dish of cold soba noodles which compliment the salt form the broth and duck very nicely.  My favorite was the kimchee pork belly, the pork belly was cut very thin and had great flavor and tenderness.  The kimchee wasn't overpowering and added a nice flavor and seasoning to the vegetables and meat.  The most interesting item that came with the pork belly was the mochi.  It comes in a separate dish and it really hard but once its cooked in the broth, it becomes very chewy.  All the dishes come with vegetables by the way.  \n\nBE SURE TO SAVE ROOM AT THE END...when you're finished eating all the meat and vegetables, they use the leftover broth, pour some cooked rice to create this awesome porridge.  They take out whatever left over ingredients in the broth (if you are too full to eat them), pour the cooked rice in the broth, let it come to a boil until it thickens a little bit.  Then they pour a raw egg, seaweed and green onions as it all comes together to create a very flavorful porridge, a nice way to end a meal on.  If it's too salty for you, they can add more rice or water to balance it out for you.  If you're too full to eat the porridge, you can also take it home and it will taste just as good the following day.  Great way to make use of all the leftover food and ingredients when most shabu places tend to waste a lot of leftover food and some even charge when there is an all you can eat option. Since you get this porridge at the end, the meals don't come with rice.  You will have to order it on the side but I was fine without it.  \n\nStaff was extremely friendly and helpful, they were very prompt on refilling my teacup.  Decor was very nice but this is a very small place.  I think they could use a better ventilation system, the windows got all foggy and it was a little steamy inside.

They use the space to the fullest extent... like there's barely any room for the waiters to move around AND it's a fucking sauna in there. It's so funny cuz the glass windows literally steam up and you can't see anything outside. Ok on the important part... the food.\n\nYou order a set of broth and meat and choose regular or large. The sets come with the items listed plus assorted veggies, noodles, and rice. You can also add veggies and more meat for an additional fee. I thought that the sets provided more than enough. For a party of 2, order these two sets to share... perfect combination!\n\n+ Sukiyaki (wagyu beef and shirataki in warishita broth) - I liked their sukiyaki. Sometimes it can be TOO sweet or salty, but theirs is just right. Wagyu beef is super on point... really great quality.

Again the wagyu beef is great and I don't think I'd ever stray from beef with shabu. \n\n+ porridge - What's different about Nabe that I really enjoyed was the porridge they make for you at the end of your meal. They simply ask you to choose a broth, add rice and condiments, and voila... delicious. \n\nAsk for their ponzu and goma sauce because I don't think they don't serve it automatically with your set.

There's not much flavoring to it but it allows you to enjoy the natural beefiness of the well-marbled washugyu beef (http://bit.ly/UEmZz3). The accompanying sesame paste with bonito and ponzu sauce were deliciously mouth-watering and full of umami flavors (http://bit.ly/UEn7yK).\n\nHowever, when I got a taste of Mr. NSS' Warishita broth (Sukiyaki set), I was in shabu heaven (http://bit.ly/UEndGE). The delicious broth imparted a savory sweetness into the beef that was addicting that I abandoned my own pot. I loved the accompanying raw egg that added a layer of creaminess.\n\nSaving the best for last is the Zosui.

I just want to note that the nabemono sets include meat/seafood, noodles, and assorted vegetables paired with a broth. Your meal ends with a Zosui rice soup using the flavored broth from the cooking. Pricing is $18 per person for a regular portion, $22 per person for a large portion.\n\nThey also have a seasonal nabemono winter set called Kamonanban, which includes duck breast and Tokyo negi with Dashi broth, regular $23 and large $28.\n\nOur group of 9 entered the restaurant around 5:30 PM without a reservation, and we were lucky to nab the long communal table in the back. The restaurant can only seat 32, so I would definitely recommend a reservation during normal dining hours. Service is good, with multiple waitresses running around checking on things, refilling water, and asking if the group is ready for the Zosui rice. However, the entire endeavor is a bit time-consuming given the ingredient preparation, table stove heating, and rice porridge finale. Our group was there for TWO HOURS. Crazy.\n\nMy PDC family ordered 2 regular sets: the SUKIYAKI (Washugyu beef with a sweet Warishita broth) and the SHABU SHABU (Washugyu beef or Kurobuta pork with either traditional konbu or spicy miso broth).

The vegetable/udon plate came with chopped cabbage, baby spinach leaves, a few slices of squash, two slabs of tofu, enoki mushrooms, a quartered shiitake mushroom, a few carrot pieces in cute shapes, and udon noodles. To be honest, I wish they gave more vegetables because spinach severely shrinks :(\n\nSince the sukiyaki set came with Washugyu beef, we opted for the Kurobota pork in spicy miso broth, per my big's recommendation. When our pot came to our table, the vegetables were already swimming in it (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Zp7qpP_MynVcMIw3wA0TQ/l.jpg). This gave the scallions, mushrooms, tofu, cabbage, carrots, chrysanthemum leaves, and these spotted, slightly-crunchy, translucent noodles more time to cook. We added the meats on par with our consumption; I enjoyed the beef and pork equally :)\n\nRegarding the broths, I definitely preferred the sukiyaki's Warishita. The sweetened soy base adds subtle undertones to the hot pot ingredients, although the spicy miso adds that kick most people enjoy with their meat. The sukiyaki also comes with a raw egg that you crack into a bowl and dip your meat and vegetables in. So strange! I loved the added creaminess hehe. Screw Salmonella.\n\nAfter all is eaten, a waitress scoops out some of your broth and adds in some rice to make this delicious porridge chock full of hot pot flavor. You can choose to split your rice between the two broths or have it half-half. We asked for half-half, and she let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes before returning to stir in the beaten egg, nori, and green onions. I definitely would vouch for the Warishita broth over the spicy miso broth because at the end of the stewing, the savoriness of the boiled ingredients blends harmoniously with the innate sweetness of the broth.\n\nMax 4-way credit card split, and make sure to let them know before the ring things up. Also, they have one bathroom hidden behind a curtain. It has a weird sliding door...\n\nAll in all, I would recommend 2 regular nabemono sets to be shared among 3 people.

The ponzu sauce was really delicious, the sesame sauce just so-so. I like the bottled goma-shabu I can buy at the supermarket better to be honest.

Instead, most of what you're going to have is already in the pot, with the exception of the mochi and rice sides.

And their zosui, unfortunately, is unbearably salty, unlike other places I've been to that offer this. Your choice of broth will certainly have something to do with this, but my recommendation is to have the zosui made, and then packed to go so you can dilute it back at home with more rice and water/plain stock.

Instead, most of what you're going to have is already in the pot, with the exception of the mochi and rice sides. And, after you're done with your meats, rather than noodles, you can have them use one of the remaining broths to make zosui (rice porridge/congee).\n\nOkay food overall, with nothing standing out in particular. And their zosui, unfortunately, is unbearably salty, unlike other places I've been to that offer this. Your choice of broth will certainly have something to do with this, but my recommendation is to have the zosui made, and then packed to go so you can dilute it back at home with more rice and water/plain stock.

It's like two meals in one!\n\nA new hotpot restaurant in Inner Sunset that opened only 3 weeks ago? Hot damn! Cherylynn's review is so thorough that I don't need to bother with all the details. I just want to note that the nabemono sets include meat/seafood, noodles, and assorted vegetables paired with a broth. Your meal ends with a Zosui rice soup using the flavored broth from the cooking. Pricing is $18 per person for a regular portion, $22 per person for a large portion.\n\nThey also have a seasonal nabemono winter set called Kamonanban, which includes duck breast and Tokyo negi with Dashi broth, regular $23 and large $28.\n\nOur group of 9 entered the restaurant around 5:30 PM without a reservation, and we were lucky to nab the long communal table in the back. The restaurant can only seat 32, so I would definitely recommend a reservation during normal dining hours. Service is good, with multiple waitresses running around checking on things, refilling water, and asking if the group is ready for the Zosui rice. However, the entire endeavor is a bit time-consuming given the ingredient preparation, table stove heating, and rice porridge finale. Our group was there for TWO HOURS. Crazy.\n\nMy PDC family ordered 2 regular sets: the SUKIYAKI (Washugyu beef with a sweet Warishita broth) and the SHABU SHABU (Washugyu beef or Kurobuta pork with either traditional konbu or spicy miso broth). Our order came with 3 plates, one for each of the meats (15 slices of thinly sliced, beautifully marbled beef: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZwBukC0KhMXJKbmaNfKPFw/l.jpg, forgot to take a picture of the pork, oops) and another for the combined vegetables and udon (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oENOdFCIcUrOqzm1cSXdgg/l.jpg). The vegetable/udon plate came with chopped cabbage, baby spinach leaves, a few slices of squash, two slabs of tofu, enoki mushrooms, a quartered shiitake mushroom, a few carrot pieces in cute shapes, and udon noodles. To be honest, I wish they gave more vegetables because spinach severely shrinks :(\n\nSince the sukiyaki set came with Washugyu beef, we opted for the Kurobota pork in spicy miso broth, per my big's recommendation. When our pot came to our table, the vegetables were already swimming in it (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Zp7qpP_MynVcMIw3wA0TQ/l.jpg). This gave the scallions, mushrooms, tofu, cabbage, carrots, chrysanthemum leaves, and these spotted, slightly-crunchy, translucent noodles more time to cook. We added the meats on par with our consumption; I enjoyed the beef and pork equally :)\n\nRegarding the broths, I definitely preferred the sukiyaki's Warishita. The sweetened soy base adds subtle undertones to the hot pot ingredients, although the spicy miso adds that kick most people enjoy with their meat. The sukiyaki also comes with a raw egg that you crack into a bowl and dip your meat and vegetables in. So strange! I loved the added creaminess hehe. Screw Salmonella.\n\nAfter all is eaten, a waitress scoops out some of your broth and adds in some rice to make this delicious porridge chock full of hot pot flavor. You can choose to split your rice between the two broths or have it half-half. We asked for half-half, and she let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes before returning to stir in the beaten egg, nori, and green onions. I definitely would vouch for the Warishita broth over the spicy miso broth because at the end of the stewing, the savoriness of the boiled ingredients blends harmoniously with the innate sweetness of the broth.\n\nMax 4-way credit card split, and make sure to let them know before the ring things up. Also, they have one bathroom hidden behind a curtain. It has a weird sliding door...\n\nAll in all, I would recommend 2 regular nabemono sets to be shared among 3 people. Both the SUKIYAKI and SHABU SHABU sets were fantastic, although I have a preference for the sukiyaki's broth and raw egg dip. I liked both the beef and the pork, and the beef is exceptionally marbled. And don't forget the Zosui rice porridge at the end!

I had heard a lot of good things about this place and always wanted to try it for their \"after meal\" where at the end they add rice and egg into your shabu broth and you get a rice porridge.  \n\nWe came about an hour before they closed and there was still quite a few people there.  My boyfriend got the shabu shabu with wagyu beef and spicy miso and I got the sukiyaki with wagyu beef.  Out of the two I personally liked the sukiyaki better. The broth itself was sweet and tasted amazing after dipping your beef in it and then the raw egg they give you. Portion wise they could have been more generous but I understand since it's lunch time their portions are probably smaller than a dinner plate.  We both finished our meat in no time at all and had to order an additional plate of meat because we were still hungry. The meat was good, soft and not frozen like many other places, and I loved the vegetable assortment, especially the variety if mushrooms and kabocha squash!\n\nWhen we were all done the waitress have us the bill and I was thinking... \"We don't get the rice and egg add ins?\" So my boyfriend asked our waitress and she told us it was only during dinner that they do that.   Seeing the disappointment on my face the waitress was sooo kind and said she could bring us a bowl of rice and I could make it myself since my meal already came with a raw egg.  She ended up making the whole thing for us, adding the rice, taking out excess soup to make the rice to soup ratio even, stirring in the raw egg, and she went above and beyond and brought us the green onion and seaweed garnishes to put on top.  The customer service that we experienced was AMAZING and our waitress was really sweet.  And I'm glad we got to try the rice porridge because it was delicious!! \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back again but I prefer AYCE when doing hot pot or shabu.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-03-30"}, {"excerpts": ["You're given a generous helping of spinach, cabbage, shiitake and enoki mushrooms, carrots, tofu and kabocha squash. "], "author": "Priscilla W.", "review": "Nabe is the new, popular Japanese hot pot restaurant in the Inner Sunset. They have an inadequate ventilation system, so the front windows are usually covered with steam; it's no surprise if you overlook this restaurant while walking along 9th Avenue. However, the restaurant's name, displayed cleverly with a bold, blue neon lighting against the black exterior, is easily seen across the street, up to half a block away. It's like your calling to come in on a cold day for some yummy Japanese-style comfort food.\n\nWe tried Nabe a few Saturdays ago for an early dinner around 6PM. As newbies, the menu was a little confusing at first. But our server, Nhu, was very helpful explaining how everything worked. Basically, the nabemono sets are portioned per person. They come with the meat, noodles, and vegetables in the broth, all already in a large pot. That pot is brought to your table stove to cook. However, there is one shabu shabu set (beef or pork for choice of meat), which is the only nabemono set that doesn't have the ingredients already in the pot. In other words, you cook it yourself at the table.\n\nWe shared the beef and pork shabu shabu and opted for one regular miso broth and one spicy miso broth (traditional kombu (kelp) in water was the other option for shabu shabu broth). I definitely preferred the beef over the pork. Both meats were very fresh and delicious, but the beef was flavorful on its own that sauce wasn't necessary. Vegetables were fresh and abundant. You're given a generous helping of spinach, cabbage, shiitake and enoki mushrooms, carrots, tofu and kabocha squash. The miso broth was very mild, and the spicy miso definitely had some heat.\n\nI love the idea of using leftover broth for rice porridge, so you're not wasting the broth. The waitress comes over to make it for you. That Saturday night we went, there were only three waitresses in the restaurant, so I give our server credit for doing so much, shuffling back and forth to other tables but still tending to ours. The broth is usually concentrated after your meal, so you can ask for them to dilute it. The rice porridge is a perfect compliment at the end of our meal, keeping us warm before we leave the restaurant and endure the cold night.\n\nNabe is a relatively small restaurant. There's two long communal tables and three smaller 4-person tables. Not a lot of walking room either.

Pros are that you can get whatever you want at once because they will have all cooked at the same time!  \n\nAfter you are done eating, they prepare a type of rice soup.  They ask you what type of broth you want the rice soup to be made in.  Then, they bring out green onions, egg, seaweed, and of course rice.  They add the rice into the broth.  Then they slowly drain the broth until the rice is clearly visible under the broth.  After that, the egg and green onions are stirred into the equation.

When we walked in my dad mentioned that his glasses fogged up, and maybe it's better right when they open, but I thought it smelled kind of sweaty. It was great that we made a reservation because we had a table for two in the corner of the restaurant (I'm not a fan of sharing my space and sitting next to strangers).\n\nTheir bathroom is pretty nice inside. The door is a sliding door which even though I thought was pretty cool, was pretty embarrassing when I was standing outside the bathroom door for longer than 15 seconds trying to figure to whether there was someone in there or not.\n\nOverall our meals ended up being pretty pricey (no thanks to the side of duck) but I'd come back again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-26"}, {"excerpts": ["I usually switch out the mochi for udon noodles)\n\nSERVICE:\nFriendly and prompt staff.

And their zosui, unfortunately, is unbearably salty, unlike other places I've been to that offer this. Your choice of broth will certainly have something to do with this, but my recommendation is to have the zosui made, and then packed to go so you can dilute it back at home with more rice and water/plain stock.

After being seated, another server came by and kindly explained the menu thoroughly to us. Apparently, the restaurant serves nabemonos(aka nabe) and not your basic shabu. On their menu, there was a list of different nabe sets and our server explained that all sets but the shabu shabu set(yes, it's still an option here!) come with a pot of broth that already contains most of the paired items inside of the pot--whereas for the shabu shabu set, the meat, noodles, and veggies are all given separately. I wanted shabu at the start because I wanted to cook my own food yakno, so we ordered the shabu shabu set with beef and miso broth and the kimchi with pork belly set. Now let's break it down:\n\nFood-Super yummy! The shabu shabu set was like other shabu I've had--but still good. The kimchi set was my fav *o* The bae also agreed that the kimchi was also his fav, hehe. The level of spiciness of the broth was perfect. I love eating spicy food even though I can't handle it well LOL, but it was still bearable. Pork belly of course was good, obvi. Best part about the kimchi set was that it came with little mochi cubes instead of noodles!! When we cooked it in the broth, it became squishy and just amazingggg. \n\nBest part of the meal had to be the rice finisher. When we were done eating, our server asked if we were ready for the rice finisher and I was like \"Okay!\", but then bae and I looked at each other like huh?? She came back with rice, egg, seaweed and green onions and explained to us that the rice finisher(zosui?) is served at the end of each meal. We chose to have it prepared in the kimchi broth and omg, it was so good. It is basically rice soup/porridge/jook/chao/whatever you wanna call it--but better. You can say that we both left with with a food baby.\n\n\nEnvironment- The restaurant layout is really cute and compact. Not many tables and the aisles were quite small, but still walkable.

They do shabu a bit different here, they call it Nabemono but its practically the same thing.  Most shabu restaurants I've been to usually bring out the soup and the uncooked ingredients on a plate.  At Nabe they already put everything in the pot, with the flavored broth.  They do have one dish, called Shabu, where you do put the ingredients in yourself.  The food was excellent, the thinly sliced washugyu beef was very tender and flavorful.  We also had an order of the seafood mix which had a great variety of seafood options which included salmon, clams, shrimp and scallops.  The seasonal special was a duck breast which was very good but be sure not to cook the duck too long, the water can boil quick and the duck can get over cooked.  It comes crusted on the skin side but the rest of the duck is rare until they turn on the electric burner on.  The broth is came with was very good, wasn't too salty.  It also came with a small dish of cold soba noodles which compliment the salt form the broth and duck very nicely.  My favorite was the kimchee pork belly, the pork belly was cut very thin and had great flavor and tenderness.  The kimchee wasn't overpowering and added a nice flavor and seasoning to the vegetables and meat.  The most interesting item that came with the pork belly was the mochi.  It comes in a separate dish and it really hard but once its cooked in the broth, it becomes very chewy.  All the dishes come with vegetables by the way.  \n\nBE SURE TO SAVE ROOM AT THE END...when you're finished eating all the meat and vegetables, they use the leftover broth, pour some cooked rice to create this awesome porridge.  They take out whatever left over ingredients in the broth (if you are too full to eat them), pour the cooked rice in the broth, let it come to a boil until it thickens a little bit.  Then they pour a raw egg, seaweed and green onions as it all comes together to create a very flavorful porridge, a nice way to end a meal on.  If it's too salty for you, they can add more rice or water to balance it out for you.  If you're too full to eat the porridge, you can also take it home and it will taste just as good the following day.  Great way to make use of all the leftover food and ingredients when most shabu places tend to waste a lot of leftover food and some even charge when there is an all you can eat option. Since you get this porridge at the end, the meals don't come with rice.  You will have to order it on the side but I was fine without it.  \n\nStaff was extremely friendly and helpful, they were very prompt on refilling my teacup.  Decor was very nice but this is a very small place.  I think they could use a better ventilation system, the windows got all foggy and it was a little steamy inside.

The new panna cotta is super creamy and their mochi cake which is served warm with ice cream is delicious. I usually get the duck breast and my BF gets the spicy miso shabu. I think it's one of the best combos ever. Best part is, they take rsvp despite party size! Super plus.
