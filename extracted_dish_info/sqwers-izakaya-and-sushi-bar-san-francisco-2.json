The restaurant is clean and spacious, sushi rolls are priced average, presented well (not too big/little or rolled messily, generous fish portions), and tasted great.  I highly recommend the wasabi hama roll if you like hamachi. The service is excellent - nice waiter who never let our glasses get empty.
