The pulled pork sandwich was excellent though, nice flavor and very hearty on the meat. The shoestring fries were good too...not too oily but perfectly crisp. The runaway winner though was the pistachio baked brie salad.

I really only eat omelets and scrambles. I was truly disappointed to be served an omelet that fell apart on its own: it was runny and very bland. I added a lot of salt & pepper and hot sauce...but still, I ended up leaving about half the egg. On the plus side, it was stuffed with a LOT of spinach & mushrooms, and really, just small amount of feta (which I prefer to avoid overly greasy food). Surprisingly the feta couldn't add enough salt or savory flavor to save the egg. The potatoes served with it were soggy and a bit cold. And that is definitely a sad thing: home fries should be crisp and a little spicy and flavorful...these were not.\n\nI would go back, but I would not order breakfast foods.
