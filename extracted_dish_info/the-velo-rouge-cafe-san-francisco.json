I'm a foodie, but a bike enthusiasts, so I was ready to flip a 180 and search up a new place to chow down but actually saw that people were eating and being served food. What the hey, why not. \n\n\"Breakfast served All Day\"\nI like you guys already.\n\nMCALLISTER SCRAMBLE SANDWICH - $6.95 : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HjKRwtL3gZ2RL3KQULXKsA?userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ#hPSVGZqGbJAWPjl0HACS0A\nThis open-faced badboy consisted of 3 scrambled eggs, bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms, spinach, and feta cheese, all toppled over two toasted English muffins with a side of house potatoes. \n\nTHIS WAS SO MUCH FOOD (see picture). The scramble sandwich was PACKED with grilled onions, TONS of mushrooms, a GARDEN of spinach, and smokey BACON everywhere. The muffins were exceptionally nice too, with the tops crispy, and the insides warm and chewy, just like how I like em'. Hands down, one of the best and hearty $7 eats I've had in a LONG time. \n\nMT. VENTOUX BREAKFAST SANDWICH - $4.95 + $1.25 (AVOCADO) : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HjKRwtL3gZ2RL3KQULXKsA?userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ#A7PRkGDRyJ0R78M_R8VKeg\nThey begin with grilled egg, smokey bacon bites, and jack cheese and melt all that into your choice of a croissant, bagel, or English muffin. It's a small eat, but very portable and packed with your breakfast essentials. Don't forget to add the avocado! \n\nWhat makes VRC 5-stars is not because of the bomb breakfast nor how affordable the food can be, but it's the customer service.\n\nI came here today (8/16) and I had to write this review because of their outstanding service! \n\nPutting all the bicycle photos and wacky bike-inspired furniture and bike references, you have a small coffee shop with a few outdoor seating spots. Intentionally, my girlfriend and I wanted to dine-in since it would be more convenient but all of the tables and chairs were taken, so instead, we just got our order to go. (Why not take a walk into Golden Gate Park and have a little picnic, right?)\n\nThe staff acknowledged our request and changed our dine-in order to a to-go. Another one of the staff members rushed outside just to make sure there wasn't any open spaces or tables that needed to be bussed. Nope, still all full. No biggie.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, our to-go order came out and was brought to us, along with 2 additional plates and utensils.The staff member asked if we would still like to dine-in since a table actually opened but since we already had everything in to-go containers, we said it wasn't necessary and didn't want to waste their container. He insisted and said it was perfectly fine, with the biggest smile I've seen at 1PM. With a smile like that, we decided to dine in with out to-go order. \n\nOf course, the food was excellent, but as I was washing it all down with the coffee I ordered, it had a really strong sour pungent taste to it, despite adding my usual dosage of sugar. Maybe it was just me but I asked one of the staff members if it was normal. With any no hesitation whatsoever, he said he would make me a new beverage immediately and noted that VRC's coffee is just like that and quite strong since it's Blue Bottle coffee and individually dripped (I'm a Blue Bottle virgin, I admit it). But within minutes, my new beverage was out and ready to go. \n\n\nVery affordable eats.\nFresh ingredients all made-to-order. \nLocal Richmond district hidden gem.\nBlue Bottle Coffee, if your a fan.\nand of course, the Amazing Phenomenal Service.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-08-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the McAllister Scramble Sandwich, and it was seriously amazing, so flavorful, and a perfect portion.

Decent sandwiches. A bit overpriced and there is an extra charge for credit/debit. Clerks could also be a bit friendlier.\n\nUpdate: Unfortunately, I'm here to update my review and lower it to 2 stars, which I feel is actually generous. I recently got one of their vegetarian sandwiches and I have to say, it was terrible. \n\nIt may not be easy to make a great sandwich. But It's also probably not easy to make a sandwich this bad. And it certainly wasn't worth 10 bucks. To start, the bread tasted dry and stale.\n\nThe sandwich was meant to have hummus on it. However, there was no hummus. The big problem what that is that there are no other condiments in the sandwich. So, when you forget to add the hummus, or just don't care enough to put it in, the sandwich is basically a dry, unenjoyable mess that falls apart, since there's nothing to moisten it or hold it together.\n\nNext, the cheese. I didn't need cheese on a vegetable sandwich. But it came with it. So, what the heck, why not. The problem, however, is that there was literally a HALF INCH of cheese in this thing. To put that in perspective, that easily a 1/4 inch too much cheese to put in a grilled cheese sandwich. It's WAY too much cheese. The sandwich, which was fairly large, was basically 1/4 cheese. Imagine eating a 1/4 inch of cheddar cheese between two pieces of stale bread.\n\nSo, here I am trying to get the healthier sandwich option on the menu. But what I get is a really dry, stale sandwich with no condiments or hummus whatsoever, and which is filled with a seemingly random handful of dry vegetables. But on top of that, it has a whole brick of cheese in the middle! It was so bad. \n\nI should have returned the food and complained. But I honestly just wanted to forget about it as soon as possible. So, I just ate the side salad that it came with and sadly put the rest of the sandwich in the compost.\n\nI feel like these people owe me a meal.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-03-02"}, {"excerpts": ["and it comes with a side salad with sweet corn and strawberries on top. \n\n"], "author": "Julia H.", "review": "I love this place!

You can tell when veggies/fruit was previously frozen and defrosted. Maybe not in say a spinach Peasant Pie but, seriously I'll notice if my cucumber slices and strawberries are translucent, water logged and soggy. It STUNS me to think that Velo Rouge would serve previously frozen strawberries in a granola bowl and soggy cucumbers in my side salad. Instant no-no and careless. \n\nSecond off, the Peasant Pie? Sounded interesting and tasted interestingly bad. The filling at potential but, the dough ruined it for us. It was chewy and tasted stale and not the right pastry for a Peasant Pie. \n\nThird off and final straw was the bagel. Nobody even bother to spread the cream cheese. It was literally cut off the block they have and sandwiched in between the bagel. They didn't even think to give us a butter knife to spread it ourselves when our order came. \n\nHonestly, I am disappointed in this restaurant and largely because of the lack of attention to detail and bad quality ingredients they serve their customers.
