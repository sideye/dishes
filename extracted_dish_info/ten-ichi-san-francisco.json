It's close to where we work (2 blocks away) and so when we are craving Japanese, we order from here. Usually, someone else picks up for us so we don't know what the wait is like but the most recent time, we went to pick up by ourselves. We were not acknowledged for at least 5 minutes, maybe more. We were standing right by the register and the waiter and waitress walked by at least 10 times. For good service, I expect them to at least ask us what we want. They had no idea if we were there to pick up food, order, or anything! Finally, we got their attention to tell them that we are here to pick up take out. The man apologized and said they were busy (although the restaurant wasn't full), which is fine. I just want to know that you know I'm there and why I'm there. I also want to note that we were told to pick up in 25 minutes and it took about 35 minutes so be aware of that if you are ordering during your lunch hour. \n\nI got chicken katsu and gyoza for lunch. I would not suggest getting the bento box because I didn't like the tempura nor the California roll that they gave me last time. I don't like the veggies they include in the tempura and my coworkers usually just get shrimp tempura but not veggies too. The California roll last time was smooched and did not look good at all. I understand it was take out but it didn't taste good either. It didn't taste too fresh. As for the gyoza, it was a steamed kind. It was good enough but we didn't get a lot of gyoza sauce. I also didn't get enough chicken katsu sauce for my chicken katsu unfortunately :( The chicken katsu isn't bad though. They actually salt the chicken before frying so you can taste the saltiness. \n\nThis place is also kind of expensive. For lunch for 4 people, we paid a little over $100.

The last time I went, we sat at the sushi bar and that was a lot of fun!  Ask the chef about the specials and tell him about what you like (yes, you guessed it, I like it spicy!) and he will aim to please!  \n\nOther items on the menu are pretty good, too.
