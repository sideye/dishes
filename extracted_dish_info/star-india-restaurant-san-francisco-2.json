The sauce actually got better the next day since it tasted spicier. The chicken was good. I wish the pieces were smaller since it was a little hard to eat with the huge chunks of chicken.

I didn't have an overcharge problem though because I only went for the 9.99 dinner buffet.\n\nI do like the lentil dahl soup they offer -- the thickness is just right and it is on the slightly spicy side.  I prefer it here to other places which serve a literally watered down version.\n\nThe curries offered at Star India were equally divided along vegetarian and meat choices.  It also seems they vary according to the season which makes sense.  The last nite I went, they had cabbage curry, chef's curry (peas and potato), a 2nd chef's curry (vegetarian kidney beans), spinach saag with indian cheese, vegetarian korma curry, chicken masala curry, lamb curry and lamb keema (ground lamb) curry.  There was also chicken tandoori.  If I'd gone during the summer, I'm sure the veggie curries would have been slightly different.\n\nThey don't use a lot of cream and yogurt in the curries offered in the buffet, which I do appreciate (exceptions being chicken tikka masala and any kind of korma curry which require dairy, but even those aren't too heavy).\n\nI'm not a big fan of pakora fritters in general, but at least they were in chickpea batter so I could still enjoy them (I eat GF). Another gluten-free item I loaded up on was the papadum lentil crackers with cilantro yogurt chutney - YUM!  I couldn't eat the naan b/c of my wheat allergies, but I did notice that everyone who got the buffet meal were treated to freshly baked naan to order. The basmati rice was well-prepared and not mushy like some other places.  I'm trying to keep my carbs down so being able to control the amount of rice via buffet is helpful.\n\nAll in all, a good deal for 9.99 when considering my other options for the evening.

Walking in I noted that they weren't crowded and I thought \"uh-oh\" Also there was this silence in there as well. I don't know about you folks but most Indian restaurants usually have some sort of music blaring. The restaurant decor felt like it was something out of the 70's or early 80's era. \n\nAnyhow, I digress. So what you really want to know is how was the food right? It was pretty decent for a $10 all-you- can- eat buffet. They had my curry lamb, tiki marsala chicken, mango chutney and that spinach dish with the cubes of cheese. Can't really complain too much since all my favorites are there. Bonus that they had my little fried dough balls in syrup and chai tea. \n\nI highly recommend the lamb curry; it was really good. A major bummer about the lunch was that the food wasn't that hot temperature wise. Many of the dishes were luke warm. We weren't too happy about that. \n\nAlso for some odd reason I never saw the Tandoori chicken the whole time I was there. Where was the chicken? Only saw a layer of onions and a lemon wedge where the Tandoori chicken should have been. Hmmmmm..... \n\nThe naan was decent.

There's no naan at the buffet, you'll need to order that separately (and do that right away, bc it can take forever.)  Also, you can't use the Yelp Check-In Deal (Mango Ice Cream) when you get the buffet. \n\nWe had a tastier (and warmer!) meal when we ordered \u00e0 la carte, everything was delicious, but yeah, your bill will be higher.  \n\nService was off both times we went.  They seem to have an issue with my having a beer.  The first time we went, I needed to point to the beer on the menu- the waiter was either unfamiliar with it, or didn't understand me.  Maybe it's just me, but if you're selling something, know that you are, and recognize the name of it.  It gets better from here... the waiter brought my beer without asking my boyfriend if he wanted a drink, so he ordered a beer when mine was brought to the table.  Umm, the waiter took my beer from me, and gave it to my boyfriend.   This last time we went, I wasn't asked if I wanted to order a drink, the waiter scurried away after my boyfriend ordered his beer.  I gave up.\n\nGetting the bill was another challenge.  The waiter knew we were done, he asked us if we were, then took half our dishes away.  It's frustrating to sit at the table, dirty dishes piled around, watching your waiter BS with the kitchen staff.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Their mango ice cream is wonderful.
