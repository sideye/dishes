I'd walked by it a zillion times on my way to and from Bart, and my preconceptions of it had been dark indeed: it stood as a postapocalyptic monument to the faraway days of Eisenhower and Khrushchev; unchanged and uncleaned in its half century, it quietly harkened to the utopian nostalgia of innocent teenagers at soda shops, while simultaneously failing to fend off accumulated decades of urban blight. This looked like the sort of dilapidated drive-in where gangbangers and homeless denizens would gather today, the sort of place that might have been the initially cheerful setting for a B-grade horror flick in the '80s, only to become the site of real shootings in the '90s, and which of course would carry roachy, ebola-laced Z-grade food that could kill on sight.\n\nThankfully, the reality was not such a faustian tapestry. The menu on the back wall is printed in Tomorrowland-esque retro futuristic style, and includes an assortment of burgers, dawgs, fries, shakes, and (disturbingly) chicken teriyaki. Past experience has taught me wariness of eating establishments that serve burgers, burritos, *and* teriyaki -- invariably none of them will be remotely edible -- but the lack of burritos in this case allowed Whiz past my radar with only a yellow alert.\n\nTheir impressive selection of fries included regular (thin-cut), garlic (didn't try because they were $3), and seasoned (the delicious waffle kind that are near impossible to find elsewhere). I paid the extra quarter for a dollop of mediocre Ranch to dip my seasoned fries. One of my lunch companions got an involuntarily supersized order of skinny fries for dessert, which seemed only fitting after her dinosaur-shaped and very probably not organic chicken nugget entre.\n\nShakes there were runny and unmemorable, offered in a variety of flavors which would have been divine had they contained any real ice cream. And in the espresso shake I ordered, real espresso. Funny how so many things in life could be improved with the simple addition of espresso. Heed the wisdom of this lesson at every opportunity, Grasshopper.\n\nAs for the burger, I got a 1/4 pound \"junior\" cheeseburger. It was probably the closest thing to a Tommy Burger I've had in Northern California: no ingredient is of particularly high quality, yet somehow the cheapness of it all coalesces into a product that surprisingly exceeds the sum of its parts. I'd still favor an In-n-Out or Nation's burger over a Whiz, but there's something transcendently gratifying about enjoying trashy food that logic dictates should be awful. This principle actually holds together many Midwestern delicacies: green bean casserole, cherry dump cake, and jello parfait among them.\n\nThe only thing about Whiz Burger that isn't stuck in the 1950s is the prices. I shelled out $9 for the junior burger, waffle fries, and shake. Ouchitude! Sometimes the painful reality of Bay Area prices can bust the illusion of an otherwise perfectly believable anachronism.\n\nThe quantity of grease consumed over lunch would have been better spread out over a month or two; my system was generally disgruntled following the experience.

"], "author": "Brian U.", "review": "Although my mild food snobbery rarely dissuades me from trying new places, this particular one had always scared me. I'd walked by it a zillion times on my way to and from Bart, and my preconceptions of it had been dark indeed: it stood as a postapocalyptic monument to the faraway days of Eisenhower and Khrushchev; unchanged and uncleaned in its half century, it quietly harkened to the utopian nostalgia of innocent teenagers at soda shops, while simultaneously failing to fend off accumulated decades of urban blight. This looked like the sort of dilapidated drive-in where gangbangers and homeless denizens would gather today, the sort of place that might have been the initially cheerful setting for a B-grade horror flick in the '80s, only to become the site of real shootings in the '90s, and which of course would carry roachy, ebola-laced Z-grade food that could kill on sight.\n\nThankfully, the reality was not such a faustian tapestry. The menu on the back wall is printed in Tomorrowland-esque retro futuristic style, and includes an assortment of burgers, dawgs, fries, shakes, and (disturbingly) chicken teriyaki. Past experience has taught me wariness of eating establishments that serve burgers, burritos, *and* teriyaki -- invariably none of them will be remotely edible -- but the lack of burritos in this case allowed Whiz past my radar with only a yellow alert.\n\nTheir impressive selection of fries included regular (thin-cut), garlic (didn't try because they were $3), and seasoned (the delicious waffle kind that are near impossible to find elsewhere). I paid the extra quarter for a dollop of mediocre Ranch to dip my seasoned fries. One of my lunch companions got an involuntarily supersized order of skinny fries for dessert, which seemed only fitting after her dinosaur-shaped and very probably not organic chicken nugget entre.\n\nShakes there were runny and unmemorable, offered in a variety of flavors which would have been divine had they contained any real ice cream. And in the espresso shake I ordered, real espresso. Funny how so many things in life could be improved with the simple addition of espresso. Heed the wisdom of this lesson at every opportunity, Grasshopper.\n\nAs for the burger, I got a 1/4 pound \"junior\" cheeseburger. It was probably the closest thing to a Tommy Burger I've had in Northern California: no ingredient is of particularly high quality, yet somehow the cheapness of it all coalesces into a product that surprisingly exceeds the sum of its parts. I'd still favor an In-n-Out or Nation's burger over a Whiz, but there's something transcendently gratifying about enjoying trashy food that logic dictates should be awful. This principle actually holds together many Midwestern delicacies: green bean casserole, cherry dump cake, and jello parfait among them.\n\nThe only thing about Whiz Burger that isn't stuck in the 1950s is the prices. I shelled out $9 for the junior burger, waffle fries, and shake. Ouchitude! Sometimes the painful reality of Bay Area prices can bust the illusion of an otherwise perfectly believable anachronism.\n\nThe quantity of grease consumed over lunch would have been better spread out over a month or two; my system was generally disgruntled following the experience.
