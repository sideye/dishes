Philz is my go-to spot for a work day pick-me up. The coffee here is brewed by the cup to your liking.\n\nYou can't really go wrong with any of the medium roast coffees.  If you are a Philz newbie and looking for a good cup o' joe, try the Tesora, Itz the Best, Philz Harmonic, New Manhattan.  I'll be honest, I can't really tell one from the other, but have enjoyed all of these!\n\nIf you aren't big on coffee or want to change things up, try the iced mojito.  They  add fresh mint leaves to your cup, making it a refreshing and delicious beverage.\n\nTip #1: Once you know what you want, order from a barista first, THEN pay at the cash register.\n\nTip #2: Bring your own cup and they will charge you for a small.\n\nTip #3: You can request \"low fat\" versions of your coffee and they will use less sugar and low fat milk in lieu of cream.\n\nThe baristas are always friendly and will always ask you to try out your coffee to make sure it is to your liking.\n\nIn my book, Philz coffee is giving Blue Bottle a run for their money!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["More importantly \"itz the best\".\n\n"], "author": "Karsten R.", "review": "My first experience with Philz was at this location.  I am told that this one of the newer locales in the City.  More importantly \"itz the best\".\n\nFor consistancy, service and location there is no other Philz that can even come close.  As Saturday morning regulars we look forward to seeing the same baristas (reads: Austin) each week.  They are friendly, helpful and funny.  Most importantly they know their product.\n\nThe other Philz locations are great, don't get me wrong.  I have been to all of the stores in the City multiple times since first finding this addiction to the \"one cup at a time\" philosophy.

So after an amazing breakfast at Brenda's, Daniel and I headed on over to Philz for a cup of Joe.\n\nThis place is small but cute. I was immediately impressed with the selection of coffee and how they freshly brew there coffee. There was a vast selection to choose from. I'm a dark French roast type of girl, so the super friendly barista suggested a special dark roast type called the jacob, I ordered a small soy cafe au late with x tra foam and 2 splenda, Daniel ordered some sort of iced coffee with soy.\n\nBefore making my drink, the barista gave me a selection of soy to choose from (I chose Vanilla) he even added my special truvia sweetener in it before making! When the barista finished my drink he made sure it was exactly how I prefer, he even asked if I would prefer to have more soy of foam! They really go out of there way to make sure you are satisfied! Man I wish they had one close by where I live! Super Impressive!!\n\nMy drink was great! Coffee was strong and had a good flavor. I really appreciate how they go out of there way to satisfy you and are so upbeat and friendly, it really creates a positive atmosphere that keeps you coming back. The one complaint I would say is that there was not a counter space to put your coffee and add condiments and the place is a little small. Other than that the coffee was solid with good flavor  the service was top notch, I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-02-15"}], "fair trade organic peru": [], "colombian": []}
