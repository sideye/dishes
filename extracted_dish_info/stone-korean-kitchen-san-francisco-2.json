I don't eat meat anymore so most of what I consumed was either seafood or non-animal based, but it was super yummy.  \n\nI was with out it town guests from Germany that had never tried Korean food so I thought that the Stone Korean Kitchen would be a good start.  Me and my husband on the other hand had (before I stopped eating meat) been frequent AYCE Korean BBQ eaters so I believe I'm a connoisseur of the meats and a wide variety of banchan. \n\nWe ordered tons of food and drinks.  See below.\n\nThe drinks\n1. Pitcher of ice cold beer\n2. Pellegrino\n3. Coke\n4. Soju cocktail (I had this.  It was deliciously sweet, if I had more than one I probably would have gotten drunk).  \n5. Hot tea (I always get hot tea with my Asian food).\n\nThe food\n1. Crispy green beans (So good! Tempura fried and crispy.  Just the right amount of batter so that you could still taste the green beans. They were also had the crispy crunch that comes from being fresh). \n2. Cheesy corn (I loved the crispy edges that formed in the pan this dish was served on.  I found myself talking too much and enjoying the other foods that the corn got cold.  It was still good so I kept eating it even though I was plenty full by then.)\n3. Crispy tofu (Fried well and there was not any greasy flavor or feel.  I dipped it in the spicy mayo that was supplied with our calamari and that made it fun. There was a lot of tofu so be sure to share.)\n4. Calamari (fried just the way I like it and with light seasoning.  It came with spicy mayo and perhaps a spicy pepper sauce.  I'm actually not sure if the red pepper sauce belonged with it as there were so many dishes that maybe it was for the green beans or something. Doesn't matter, it was good with and without the sauces.) \n5. Seafood cakes (I didn't even notice it on the menu so I was glad someone ordered it. They were very flavorful and definitely something I would suggest a pescatarian to try. Not too fishy tasting either.  They reminded me a little of the crispy salmon croquettes my mother made growing up.)\n6. Stone wings (3 orders) the traditional and the spicy version. (I didn't taste these because I don't eat chicken anymore but from the looks of them I'd say they were meaty and fried up just right.  The German teenager that ordered them said they were delicious but not too hot. She likes her food really spicy. Her brother thought they were too spicy.) \n7. Bulgogi (Came with a serving of rice. Bulgogi was always my favorite food when I had KBBQ so I had to taste a piece.  It was great!  The meat was tender, not tough and full of tendons.  Getting served too many poor grades of meat is one reason why I stopped eating meat.  I like that the sauce it was marinated in wasn't too sweet, it was just right.)\n\nThe Banchan we were served were great accompaniments too.  The pickled cucumbers were slightly sweet.  The kimchi was spicy and not too sour.  The bean sprouts were my favorite.  They were salty and had a nutty flavor. I would eat the sprouts again as a side dish. \n\nI'll have to explore the menu more next time.  I was trying to get items that my German friends could enjoy that were within their comfort zone.  They loved it all, but I want to try some things that I haven't had when I visited the AYCE restaurant.  I'll try the glass noodles since they say I can replace the meat with tofu.  I'm already craving more green beans already so that's for sure on my list for more.  Maybe I'll start eating meat again by the time I'm back in San Francisco so who knows what will end up on my plate.  \n\nI've got to give props to Brian, our server, for putting up with our large table.  We did a lot of catching up with each other,  we asked lots of questions and didn't finish eating until the restaurant had closed.  I appreciate the patience of the entire staff and their positive attitudes.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Order a veggie platter (crispy green beans, crispy tofu, & jap chae) and enjoy a couple of pre-movie drink specials like we did once before heading to the theatre upstairs.

Probably doesn't forebode well but it is what it is - a so-so Korean dining experience that is slightly overpriced to pay the rent for the place with views of the Ferry Building. \n\nOne saving grace is the stone wings but then again, it is fried chicken after all. If you're a fan of Korean fried chicken, this is a nice take on it with the sweet, savory, and barely spicy glaze. The chicken was still crispy despite the liberal amount of sauce on it. \n\nThe hwae dup bap is decent, but at $20 for lunch, is a little steep. The tuna sashimi is fresh though and the variety of vegetables provide a refreshing contrast in both taste and texture to the dish. The steamed dumplings are decent but the dough is a little too thick but the filling, when combined with the dipping sauce, is decent. The seafood pancakes are forgettable. Honestly you might not even realize there is seafood in them \n\nLunch prices aren't significantly less than dinner so come for the latter since the menu is much larger then. They do have happy hour specials from 5-7pm.

To cut to the chase; GO TO THEIR HAPPY HOUR THIS MOMENT. \n\nNow that's out of the way, on to the details. \n\nThe drinks- Buy one, get one free during HH (5pm-7pm). BOMB. The drinks are fairly cheap to begin with, and the fact I can get two, makes my work day seem like a distant memory.\n\nThe food- When you sit down, you will get a little sample of their kimchee, seaweed salad, and some other small dish that has varied for me personally. W e asked for seconds and the staff was happy to oblige. We then ordered the vegetarian small plate appetizer. Wow. The jap chae, was delicious. Not greasy, the noodles were flavorful and veggies were perfect. Crispy green beans were yummy, but could not prepare us for what was still on the plate...CRISPY TOFU. The only word I can use to accurately describe it, is perfect. The crispy outside was not over done, the inside was perfectly soft, but not mushy. And the sweet garlic soy sauce to dip it in was amazing. I may have had a sip or two of it. Okay, it was three. The tofu is on top of my recommendation list! We ordered a full order after we downed the sample plate.\n\nAmbiance- I am always surprised that this place isn't more crowded, there have only been a small handful of people there during happy hour, and with the prices and food, I'm kinda glad I don't have to share.\n\nService- The staff is extremely friendly, and put up with us asking for this sauce and that pre-appetizer. I hope they don't get sick of us going there.\n\nAll in all, Stone has great deals, delicious food, and worth going to at least once, if not more!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-25"}, {"excerpts": ["We got the fried chicken (not bad), crispy green beans (not bad either), and the curry.
