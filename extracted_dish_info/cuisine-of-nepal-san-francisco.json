Over an hour Muni ride actually (with some delays). By the time we arrived, my boyfriend and I were borderline hangry. \n\nWe immediately ordered the Himalayan Momos with pork. They're kind of like any steamed pork dumplings you've probably had many times if you're familiar with Asian food, except the filling was heavily spiced with what I think might have been curry powder and cumin. And instead of vinegar or soy sauce, they were served with tomato sauce. Really good, but the real highlight were the entrees!\n\nWe picked the Chicken Cashew Cream Curry combo, and the Palak Paneer Curry combo.

"], "author": "Ed U.", "review": "For some reason, I've been riding the Nepali Express lately. No, it's not a clickety-clack train through the Himalayas. It's an exotic culinary journey that makes two stops in the East Bay (Annapurna in Oakland and Mount Everest in Berkeley) and a final stop here over the course of a month. OK, I just made that up, but that's still a lot of momos in a condensed amount of time, don't you think? Advance praise on this compact place has been overwhelmingly favorable, and in one of those rare instances when the reality matches the hype, the food here is excellent. The ambiance and staff certainly make it feel authentic, but what do I know?\n\nThe cynic in me was wondering if they hired the elder woman in the native costume as a prop (photo: http://bit.ly/2dfKbnY), but no, she was real and so was the food. The true litmus test came with the $6.99 Himalayan Momos, the indigenous steamed dumplings that I have favored since my own trip to Nepal seventeen years earlier. A half-dozen plump ones came my way stuffed with minced pork and shredded cabbage and accompanied by a unique sesame, chili and tomato chutney sauce that I didn't have at the other two spots (photo: http://bit.ly/2czFm4J). They passed my test with flying colors.\n\nPicking a main was no easy task as there were tantalizing variations on curry. From Atlantic salmon fillet to radish ginger chicken, their palette was bursting with flavors. I chose the $15.99 Chicken Cashew Cream Curry (Kukhuraku Ledo) a la carte. The chicken was clay oven flame-roasted and diced into big chunks and bathed in a lightly blended cashew cream sauce that was like ambrosia (photo: http://bit.ly/2cMmZN4). It came with a hefty portion of butter naan and basmati white rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2cDVHYa). It was awfully quiet when I dined here on a Saturday afternoon, so hopefully the five-star reviews will draw in business despite its relatively isolated location on Mission. All aboard for the Nepali Express!\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...luxuriant curries and grade-A momos put this Nepalese spot above the rest\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...native decor is not too overwhelming here though quite authentic\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...quite attentive\nTOTAL - 5 stars...hopefully not the last call for this Nepali Express!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["He explained to me how he made the cashew cream curry (he can leave out the cream for vegans); grinding the cashews by hand, caramelizing the onions, to making the tomato chutney.

I looked at my phone to see when my alarm will go off, only to realize it wasn't Monday...it was the weekend! YAS (SFW): http://bit.ly/27TSTvP!\n\nExcept hours later while flip flopping in bed, I realized that I had an appointment in 30 minutes. I hightailed outta the house and made my way to The Mission.\n\nOn my home from my appointment, I was hangry and passed by the newly opened Cuisine of Nepal (formerly Chan's Cuisine across from Zante's). I walked in disheveled in sweats covered with Tater fur, flip flops, a hair nest, and my grandma grey eyebrows (thanks to a botched tattoo job when I was 16) . \n\nThe Owner/Chef Prem welcomed me with open arms and told me to sit at any available table. I intended to do take-out because of the aforementioned but I was the only one there so I figure that I just dine in. Shit, I hope I don't meet Mr. Right today, at least not Mr. Right Now, I thought to myself. \n\nCuisine of Nepal is from the owner/chef of Little Nepal, a beloved Bernal Heights neighborhood favorite: http://bit.ly/1XV86sk. It's my understanding that once Little Nepal's lease is over on Cortland, he will make the full transition to Cuisine of Nepal. The menu is similar serving momos, samosas, curries, sizzling meat platters, naan, etc. Prices are a tad high with an individually portioned entr\u00e9e with rice ranging from $11.99 (vegetarian) to $15.99 (chicken, lamb, shrimp). For an additional $2, you can make your meal a combo with lentils, a veggie stew, and chutney. NO msg is used. Wine and beer only. They also offer free delivery within a 5 mile radius. \n\nI love nuts everything so I ordered the Kukhurako Ledo: Chicken Cashew Cream Curry w/ clay oven flamed-roasted chicken, buttered naan, basmati rice ($15.99). Initially, I thought the pricing seemed a little high for Asian food but it all made sense when my order arrived: http://bit.ly/1TGGRys. Everything is made to order and Chef Prem takes great pride in his food. He explained to me how he made the cashew cream curry (he can leave out the cream for vegans); grinding the cashews by hand, caramelizing the onions, to making the tomato chutney. It's all about building those layer of flavors and it shows (all without the use of msg). \n\nUpon my first bite, I melted into my seat in utter satisfaction. The sauce was velvety smooth, incredibly rich, wonderfully spiced, and mildly spicy. Similar to a Tikka Masala or Butter Chicken sauce without all that grease from butter or ghee since cashew cream is used instead. Dunking the freshly made, piping hot buttered naan into the curry was sublime. Not a fan of white chicken meat unless I'm eating salads but the white chunks of chicken were nicely tender. I could of finished everything in one sitting but I took half home so I can savor for later. I ate the leftovers 2 days later and the sauce was even better as the flavors developed even more. That cashew cream curry is everything...it will make even shoe leather taste good so this dish is highly recommended.\n\nService was very swift, hospitable, and attentive since I was the only one there at the time. I wanted to get my weekend buzz going so I wanted to enjoy a beer with my lunch. They didn't have the small 12 oz bottle of the Taj Mahal in stock but Chef Prem popped open a 22 oz, and told me to drink as much as I can, and he will only charge me for the small bottle. Such a kind gesture that was much appreciated.  \n\nThe building has an odd layout. As you enter, you're basically walking through a narrow hallway of two tops and then they have larger tables in the back to seat two groups of six, with total seating for 30. They did the best they could to utilize the space and turn it into a homey, neighborhood restaurant.\n\nAs I finishing up lunch, a female solicitor walks in with bags of makeup. She gives her sales pitch to the Chef Prem and I, and asks if we wanted to buy the bag of discounted makeup for $20 ($100 value). \n\nChef Prem: \"Sorry, I don't wear makeup but do you want a cup of hot tea.\" (See how nice this guy is!)\n\nSolicitor *Looks at me*\n\nMe: \"No, thank you.\" \n\nSolicitor: \"But, I have a really good mascara...make you look sexy.\"\n\nMe: \"No, thank you.\" \n\n*Telepathing to her that I don't normally look like horse manure*\n\nSolicitor: \"Dun you waaan booooifriiiien?\"\n\nOoooh nooooo, she diiiidin't. \n\n*Z-line snap*", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-05-26"}, {"excerpts": ["The roasted tomato chutney sauce is amazing and I dipped everything I ate in it.
