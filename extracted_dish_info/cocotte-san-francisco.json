The ravioli was more of a soupy mess with some pasta thrown on top of the small dish, not very good, but the presentation was enough to ruin it for me.

We made a reservation for late on Saturday night with an hour of lead time. We arrived 10 minutes early and were sat at a high top in the bar area. Cocotte is not a big restaurant at all so the bar area and the dining room are pretty much one in the same. However, we were not given menus for 10 minutes and it became very clear that our server was actually the bartender who had to come out from behind the bar to take our order and check on us. This resulted in a lot of delays both in actually getting menus, placing our order and getting the bill. It wasn't a big deal since we weren't in a rush and did eventually get service but my suggestion to the restaurant is to actually have a waiter (not the bartender) assigned to that table.\n\nI got a very nice glass of Bordeaux and A had a great beer that he hadn't tried from Headlands Brewing. Definitely a small, but mighty, alcohol selection. Having been here before and remembering how good the food was, we both got exactly what we ordered the previous time. A got the Beef Wellington which was delicious, if not a smaller portion. He wasn't full when he was done but since you can never find Beef Wellington on a menu, he was happy. I got the Coq Au Vin which was just as hearty and delicious as I remembered. Since mine was a really generous size, A was able to have quite a bit.\n\nWe originally weren't going to get dessert but after watching other tables and seeing what they were getting, we decided to splurge. We had a very hard time deciding from their large list full of particularly tempting items but ultimately settled on the Banana Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Seriously, it is a must-order.\n\nAll in all, Cocotte is an awesome, cozy spot for some good French food. The prices are fine and the food is delicious.

Tough area to find parking- the trolley runs through here too. \n\nWe sat down on a Saturday evening, the small room was mostly full and filling up while we started. It's a cool ambience - the front is open to the sidewalk and there's a compact but well put together bar on the right as you walk in. My friend brought in a bottle of Parador Reserve Tempranillo - and older vintage that was drinking perfectly. The waiter came over and opened the bottle. He was a very tall waiter, good attitude and said he made wine. They were pouring the Barbera and Grenache '11 at the restaurant. So we tried a glass of each. He admitted they didn't look great - they didn't and they we're just okay. Tasted like the wine of the day that they're getting rid of - or maybe use it in the Coq au vin. I suggested he taste our wine and he poured himself a full glass - which in my opinion was too much. You always let the customer pour how much, but okay let's eat. \n\nWe split an order of the Mussels and we both thought they were excellent. I wouldn't call it abundant but a good portion. The sauce was outstanding and required drenching their small baguettes into it for full enjoyment. The bread was good - slightly crusty in the best way. \nMussels Mariniere $13,00 White wine, shallots, garlic, parsley, salted butter.

We also had some white wine by the glass. Overall a great experience - service was good, staff was friendly and on top of water, bread, plates - not too soon or too late. Friendly and appropriate. \n\nThe one thing that bothered me was the waiter selling us his wine that sucked, then pouring a whole glass of our expensive bottle and then charging us the full corkage of $20 bucks. That was bullshit - but maybe like his wine he's uneducated in how you deal with those situations. I asked him to take it off and he took off $7.50 cents.

Yuri is a fantastic local purveyor of wines but is also a wine maker. His new venture, City Cellars, is now featured on the menu as of this year and every bottle I've had, while 2011 vintage and still a bit young, has excellent flavor and will bode well in another year for drinking. They're affordable wines and with the added selection of great French and Spanish wines it's a treat to stop in here all the time to try something new.\n\nAnd despite my having been here only 3 times and spaced apart by well over 6 months each visit and with different people, he always remembers who I am and makes sure to greet me.

That's one of the main reasons for why the ratings go up for me, aside from supporting wine makers.\n\nThe restaurant does run into trouble sometimes with having enough waitstaff on hand, though. But then again, we Americans have a strangeness for expecting fast service and immediate attention and truly, the wait hasn't been that long. But I do observe Yuri spending a lot of time running around to each table for more than just wine recommendations, so if you're sitting at the bar or waiting for a wine selection it might take a few minutes longer. Again, nothing obscene in terms of a long wait, but it does require you to be relaxed, not in a rush and ready to sit in for a good meal.\n\nThis is also not a good restaurant for a big dinner party. If you have more than 4 people, skip it.\n\nThe best news of all...little tourism comes here. It's all locals.

We could've used an additional piece of toast so you might want to save a small piece of your regular bread for what doesn't fit on your levain toast  \n\n3.  Farm Eggs \"meurette\" - One egg poached in Pinot that again could use more brioche to absorb all the delicious egg yolk that mingles so well with the bone marrow.

Not only does its popularity fill up the joint after about 7 PM, but its food keeps them staying.\n\nMy new friend Sara P. and I decided to try this place after it appeared on our \"New Places in San Francisco\" feed.  After I saw that they had Beef Wellington, I was instantly drawn in and wanted to try it so we thought we would try it together.  That's Yelp people for you.  Kind people that want to make friends and try good food.  My kind of people indeed.  You wanna make friends?  Join Yelp.\n\nIt wasn't an easy feat though, considering our schedules and the fact that the holidays are almost upon us but it was sure worth the trip!\n\nThe authentic French staff is so friendly and welcoming.  Get a drink at the bar first.  They have a great selection of wine and their specialty cocktail is a must try.  They don't have a cocktail list above and beyond this one drink, but this isn't really the place to sit and drink.  This is a place where you will be whisked away to South West France, where the food is good and the wine is plentiful.\n\nWe tried the ravioli appetizer which was a bit different from traditional ravioli.  Much thinner.  Almost like a wonton.  It had some type of beef in it, as well as mushrooms.  I felt that there was too much lemon in the broth, not the ravioli, but it was still delicious.  Especially for an appetizer.\n\nThe COQ AU VIN is a MUST try!  The sauce is so delectable and pairs really well with the Beef Wellington.  I recommend getting the Beef Wellington, eating half of it and mixing it with the COQ AU VIN sauce.  In fact, just request that they put the COQ AU VIN sauce with the Beef Wellington.  So delicious.  Back to the COQ AU VIN though, the meat was ok.  Dark meet that came with a few carrots and gratin potatoes.  Incredibly delectable.  I loved it.\n\nThe Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection.  A flaky pastry puff filled with beef.  I got mine medium, which I don't normally do but I think for this dish you really need to get it this way.  Only because the pastry is so delicate that you need to the beef to be softer.  Too tough and it throws off the balance of the dish.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some sauce stuff that wasn't really as good as the COQ AU VIN.  So really, request the COQ AU VIN sauce!\n\nDessert was good but I didn't want to eat too much so we got something light.  The GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLE TART TATIN was the perfect amount of dessert.  Basically just baked apples with a very thin crust/pastry at the bottom.  The perfect end to your meal.\n\nI really enjoyed this place.  I had great company, I really got to know my new friend, atmosphere and menu weren't too intimidating, staff was great and the food was just so delicious.\n\nI highly recommend to anyone in San Francisco.  Whether you are visiting, have people visiting or just want a delicious holiday meal.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nAmusez-vous!

After our 1st pour of water and taking our orders,  the waiter never stopped by once until when we flagged him down to take our plates away and that we are ready for dessert course (all dishes were brought to us by a Hispanic man who works in the open kitchen...more on him in a sec).

For dessert,  we got the banana creme brulee which def was the best experience all night.  Oh, I will also give credit to the simple yet tasty tapenade that came with the bread basket. \n\nNow onto the Hispanic staff member.  While he was cleaning off the table next to us, he knocked the entirely full jar of tapenade right onto my right leg. Despite it being a small dipping bowl, it was full so all the content was on my jeans and shoe.  Without an apology, the guy looked over at me and went back to bussing the table.  Yes, I understand it's a busy night,  but you can still say sorry and offer to bring a wet towel right?  Nope...I had to ask him for one before he was abt to walk away and when he brought it over,  it was as if I was troubling him with a stupid side task.  Since oliver oil doesn't come out easy, I spent time putting baking soda at home on my jeans and shoe with the hope that the stains will come out (I'll be calling you Cocotte if it doesn't).  \n\nIn the end,  the wife didn't want to leave tip at all but we ended up putting down 15% anyway just bc I felt generous and assumed that the entire staff including the dishwashing crew have a small cut,  too. \n\nThanks Cocotte for the lovely tapenade.

If you've reviewed the menu and it looks good to you, you won't be disappointed with the food as everything was prepared beautifully.  I had the rotisserie chicken and my partner had the coq au vin.  Both were wonderful. \n\nThe thing that was an unhappy surprise for us was the inattentive service.  We were seated at the table closest to the entrance to the kitchen area, so there was lots of staff traffic right around us, but it often felt as though we had been forgotten.  The couple at the table next to us was seated about 10 minutes after us.  The waiter immediately approached their table offering drinks and advice about the menu - we got the sense that perhaps they were regular customers.  He got to us some time after that.  It took some time for our salads to arrive. Upon the completion of the salads it was probably about 30 minutes before our entrees arrived.  When we finished our entrees we sat staring at our chicken bones for quite some time before they were cleared and we were given the opportunity to order dessert.  Our apple tarte tartin took about 20 minutes to appear.  I noticed it sitting on the counter and almost grabbed it myself, but did end up flagging down the waiter and pointing out that I thought our dessert was perhaps ready.    We were never offered a second beverage.  \n\nOur disappointment wasn't  just that things were slow, we're ok with a leisurely meal.   It's as though we weren't there and things only happened when the waiter stumbled upon us.

It wasn't busy yet when we arrived, but others soon trickled in. If you want an extra special and romantic dinner date, make reservations for their curtain-enclosed table for two --very intimate!\n\nWe started off with some complimentary bread with an anchovy and basil olive oil. This pairing was amazing and so yummy. I loved how the breads were a rustic sourdough that were the perfect slices and size to start us off. We also each had a glass of wine (a red and a white) from the HH menu for $8 each.\n\nFor our main courses, we shared the Beef Filet Wellington ($34) and the Half Chicken ($15 on HH/$21) with Shishito Peppers. I was most eager to try the beef wellington, which was great but not quite memorable. It comes in two palm-size slices of pastry-wrapped tenderloin alongside a bone marrow. If you're into bone marrow, this dish comes with it all. Unfortunately, the boyfriend and I don't find the hype in bone marrow as I had the spoonful of fatty juices from it. It's still delicious though. As for the chicken, it came with four pieces. The flavor was there, but a bit dry. We definitely needed the sauces to dip in, which we found rather flavorless as well.\n\nThe highlight of our meal might have had to be the shishito peppers. They were incredibly flavorful and had such a killer spice to it. There was one that burned me for a few minutes. Trust me, I can handle spicy but that pepper was insanely hot!\n\nWe left fully stuffed and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

They were both great, and the restaurant has a great selection of wines, particularly reds.\n\nTo start, I had the Gruyere Cheese and Thyme Churros (3/5).  These were served with a horseradish creme fraiche, which I really liked.  The churros themselves tasted similar to mozzarella sticks but were much more subtle and with a much softer, less stringy cheese.  Although I enjoyed the texture of this appetizer, I found the taste to be much too subtle and missing a \"punch\" that I expected.  My tablemates agreed.\n\nFor the main dish, I had the squid with forbidden rice, which was just amazing (4.5/5).  I love squid ink, and this dish did not disappoint.  The rice was cooked properly, the squid was soft and flavorful, and the beurre blanc was rich and a little tart.  The dish was wonderful, but definitely on the heavier side.

The mussels were plump and the sauce delish! I haven't had foie in a while, so mi-cuit was a treat! The tacos didn't have much foie flavor, but I do love crunchy tacos so this was a nice play on beef tartar.\n\nMains and Les Cocottes:\n*Organic Petaluma chicken rotisserie served with romesco sauce, arugula pesto, creamy porcini sauce accompanied by a cocotte of your choice: Cauliflower & espelette pepper gratin ($32 whole chicken)\n*Beef wellington: maitake mushrooms, veal jus, bone marrow, breadcrumbs ($33)\n*Duck leg confit: oven farro pilaf, spring onion, blood orange gastrique jus, living watercress ($24)\n*Butcher cut: Pork ($28)\n*Spinach: golden raisins, garlic apple cider ($7)\n*Hand-cut french fries: lemon aioli ($7)\n*Cocotte of the day: Brussels sprouts ($7)\n\nI adored the special which was pork. I love a nicely cooked piece of pig. Mmmmm... meat! The duck was deliciously tender. I wasn't sure if I'd like the beef wellington due to the puff pastry, but surprisely, I did. And that piece of bone marrow? Sooo good! I'd skip the chicken next time as it was super dry and overcooked. At least the breast piece I tried to eat was. My favorite cocotte was the cauliflower gratin. And I don't even really like cauliflower. It was deliciously creamy. Like potatoes au gratin. I love spinach, but I wasn't a huge fan of the raisins. My least favorite cocotte was the brussels. They were a little undercooked and needed more oomph. They just tasted like cooked brussels which I found kind of boring.\n\nDesserts:\n*Banana creme brulee ($7)\n*Profiterolles: marsalla raisin ice cream, almonds, chocolate sauce ($7)\n\nMust have dessert is the banana brulee. Although the bananas keep it from having that hard sugary crust, I adore banana desserts and a good creme brulee, so this married the two well. I'm not a huge chocolate person so I only had a bite or so of the profiterolles. Everyone in my party enjoyed them though.\n\nDrinks:\n*Chateau respide-medeville graves '11, Bordeaux, France ($55)\n*City cellars ($15 glass)\n*Pied a terre cab ($15 glass)\n*Porto ($14 glass) \u00d72\n*Muscat ($14 glass)\n\nWhat's dinner without drinks?!

I finally settled on this place because while it is french, they did have things I thought my brother would eat on the set menu (beignets and beef wellington). I thought we were in trouble when he asked me what hors d'oeuvres meant. Seriously?! Are you sure you weren't switched at birth? When I explained it was a very common term for appetizer, and that many of the ingredients in the fancily-named dishes were things he liked he seemed to be more open to the experience, but I could tell he was reserving judgement till the food arrived. Luckily for me, the food was delicious and he actually ate most of his food until he couldn't eat anymore. Hallelujah! It's a Christmas miracle!\n\nThe waitress was really sweet and did not laugh at my brother's butchering of each dish's name (although I did). The service was excellent!

It's the dish that prompted me to study french and it's the first dessert I ever made when I was 16).\n\nEverything was delicious and plated beautifully, with one exception. The dungeness crab appetizer was awkwardly plated. While it was delicious, the plate it was on was really big and very brown. This resulted in the three elements on the plate being really far apart from each other with a big brown abyss between them. Also the brown didn't really complement the color of the sauce or the radishes. But that's a minor cosmetic flaw in an otherwise perfect meal. \n\nMerci beaucoup Cocotte!

Cocotte - not worth it even during Dine about Town, unless you enjoy the bad after taste of poor service.\n\nTo begin, it took at least 20 minutes for the waiter to even stop by, and when he did he was visibly irritated and gave us attitude as he took down our order. Side note: food came out slow as molasses too.\n\n* Wine: The wine's are pretty affordably priced (~$40-50); a Yelper warned he was scolded by the waiter for trying to order wine before his entree, so I waited until after I placed my order but the waiter walked away without taking drink orders, and could not be flagged down for another 20 minutes! Great. More waiting.\n\n* Mussels: I was impressed by the hefty portion of (mostly) fresh mussels, simmered in a flavorful sauce that goes perfect with the complimentary bread. Don't judge, but I hate being wasteful so I asked to wrap up my leftovers (which I usually toss later anyway). My waiter responded with something like, \"Really?! Are you serious?? You know you will get sick, and if you do, don't even try to come back and complain to us because I told you so.\" That was the cliff notes version, tried to cut him off as he publicly dismissed me in front of everyone, but he talked over me. He might have been right, but it was so absolutely rude and unnecessary.\n\n* Flank Steak: I liked the sauce wasn't a thick puddle of gravy like at most French restaurants. There were 2 pieces on the plate, one was cooked perfectly and I have to say I enjoyed it, the other was overdone. The fries were fried in what tasted like 3-day old oil. My friend asked for her steak to be cooked longer, and instead of taking it back, he proceeded to school her on what medium rare is and how she didn't know what it is. After an awkward and tense exchange between the two, he took the plate back and returned with overcooked steak.\n\n* Salmon in Puff Pastry: What a unique and interesting concept, I loved the contrasting textures of the buttery pastry and the salmon. The flavors were good but the salmon was slightly overcooked. \n\n* Banana Creme Brulee: Way overrated. Needed more banana flavor and the texture was grainy, not smooth. \n\n* Apple Tatin: This wasn't so much a tatin, as it was a roasted whole glazed apple on a thin crust. Disappointing.\n\n* Chocolate Mousse: Meh.\n\nThe food might be pretty good, but you can find other restaurants that serve the same quality at an equal or lesser price point.

The appetizers consisted of foie gras, poached lobster and beet salad or a goat cheese panna cotta. We both opted for the lobster and beet salad. Loved it but I'm starting to think maybe I should have gotten the foie gras for variety. My girlfriend thought there were too many beets and not enough lobster but hey, that's just more beets for me!\n\nThe entree choices were beef Wellington with potato gratin and bone marrow, seared u10 scallops over butternut squash puree with braised endive and potato gnocchi. She had the beef welly and I had the scallops. That scallop dish may have been one of the best scallop dishes I've ever had. There was this vanilla oil drizzled around the bed of puree that really gave the whole dish a beautiful fragrance and elevated flavor. The scallops were cooked perfectly and I've never enjoyed butternut squash, pureed or otherwise, the way I did that night. My girl's beef Wellington was so tender and juicy and the duxelles were so delicious. The bone marrow had a light dressing of pesto that brightened up the fattiness. \n\nFor dessert, our choices were apple tarte tatin, white chocolate Napoleon and banana creme brulee. Napoleon for the lady and the creme brulee for myself. I personally enjoyed the creme brulee more but that's not to take anything away from the Napoleon.

Nope...I had to ask him for one before he was abt to walk away and when he brought it over,  it was as if I was troubling him with a stupid side task.

In all this dish is a fail because the concept is a bit highfalutin' and unnecessary - \"seared petrale sole, pickled beets, golden raisins and garlic, lemon yogurt and dill\". \n\n Best part of my meal were probably the french fries and the few nibbles I had of the duck foie gras.

Wouldn't order that again. \n\nThe thing that made the evening was my great dining companions, but of course it being a Friday the noise level was high so it was more than a little difficult to converse.

Janice made a reservation for 5 people via OpenTable a couple weeks prior.\n\nStarters:\n*Meat platter: bressola (cured beef), duck salami sausage, local dry coppa, chicken liver terrine, grain mustard, pickled vegetables, walnut & raisin toast ($18)\n*Beef tartar & foie gras tacos: hand-cut beef tartar, capers, cornichons, shallots, grated foie gras, pickled red onion, crema fresca ($14) x2\n*Mussels marinieres: lemon, white wine, salted butter, shallot ($13)\n*Duck foie gras mi-cuit: poached red wine bartlett pear, toasted house made brioche ($22)\n\nI'm a huge charcuterie fan, so I loved the meat platter. The mussels were plump and the sauce delish! I haven't had foie in a while, so mi-cuit was a treat! The tacos didn't have much foie flavor, but I do love crunchy tacos so this was a nice play on beef tartar.\n\nMains and Les Cocottes:\n*Organic Petaluma chicken rotisserie served with romesco sauce, arugula pesto, creamy porcini sauce accompanied by a cocotte of your choice: Cauliflower & espelette pepper gratin ($32 whole chicken)\n*Beef wellington: maitake mushrooms, veal jus, bone marrow, breadcrumbs ($33)\n*Duck leg confit: oven farro pilaf, spring onion, blood orange gastrique jus, living watercress ($24)\n*Butcher cut: Pork ($28)\n*Spinach: golden raisins, garlic apple cider ($7)\n*Hand-cut french fries: lemon aioli ($7)\n*Cocotte of the day: Brussels sprouts ($7)\n\nI adored the special which was pork. I love a nicely cooked piece of pig. Mmmmm... meat! The duck was deliciously tender. I wasn't sure if I'd like the beef wellington due to the puff pastry, but surprisely, I did. And that piece of bone marrow? Sooo good! I'd skip the chicken next time as it was super dry and overcooked. At least the breast piece I tried to eat was. My favorite cocotte was the cauliflower gratin. And I don't even really like cauliflower. It was deliciously creamy. Like potatoes au gratin. I love spinach, but I wasn't a huge fan of the raisins. My least favorite cocotte was the brussels. They were a little undercooked and needed more oomph. They just tasted like cooked brussels which I found kind of boring.\n\nDesserts:\n*Banana creme brulee ($7)\n*Profiterolles: marsalla raisin ice cream, almonds, chocolate sauce ($7)\n\nMust have dessert is the banana brulee. Although the bananas keep it from having that hard sugary crust, I adore banana desserts and a good creme brulee, so this married the two well. I'm not a huge chocolate person so I only had a bite or so of the profiterolles. Everyone in my party enjoyed them though.\n\nDrinks:\n*Chateau respide-medeville graves '11, Bordeaux, France ($55)\n*City cellars ($15 glass)\n*Pied a terre cab ($15 glass)\n*Porto ($14 glass) \u00d72\n*Muscat ($14 glass)\n\nWhat's dinner without drinks?! I told the server I wanted a good red that was moderately price. Told him I'm a cab girl and he suggested the Graves. This worked great for our party! I also had a follow up glass of wine that he suggested as well. I believe it was the Pied a terre cab though. I actually enjoyed that glass more as it was a bolder red.\n\nCocotte has a charming neighborhood restaurant feel to it. A great place to have dinner with a wonderful group of friends.\n\nNote: Remember to check your bill to see if they added gratuity to it already. We were a party of 5 and they added an automatic 20% gratuity. (I always thought this only happened to parties of 6 or more. I guess every restaurant is different.)

But luckily there were plenty of tables not because it was empty but we were just lucky I guess, because it got full quickly after we were seated.   And the host was nice enough to get us a table right away.  The place is pretty small but it was not cramped, they made it work, it was pretty cozy and intimate actually.  They have nice interior decor and the ambiance is both friendly and very comfortable, I really liked it.  So, the host was very nice, the barkeeper was also nice who was nice enough to recommend the Grimbergen dubbel, which I really liked. It was flavor and almost sweet.  It was really delicious.  The server was also nice, she was patient with me since I'm actually ignorant \n\nSo, on to the food:\nDuck platter:duck & sunchoke rillette, duck salami, house smoked duck breast, walnut muffin, red onion pickles, grain mustard.  This is very delicious, I like the rillette the most, it full of flavor yet light and not very rich, which is great in my opinion.  The duck salami is also very good but if I'm forced to choose one, I'll go with rillette.  Good thing it's a platter.  I don't know how they know but the grain mustard is the right condiment.  I took a piece of the walnut muffin and put on rillette, salami, duck breast, the red onion pickles and top if all off with the grain mustard and put them all in my mouth, it's not finesse but it's an explosion of flavors.  \n\nPotato gratin with goat cheese:  Very tasty.  Enough said.\n\nbeef filet wellington:wild mushroom, puff pastry, beef jus.  Never had beef wellington before so I was looking forward to tasting this and it was worth having it here for my first beef wellington.  The beef was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the pastry was crisp, light and airy, it was great.  It was so good that I finished it in record time, I did not time it but it was pretty fast, my friend was impressed.  \n\nBranzini sea bass: Anchovies crust, couscous, sweet'100 tomato, lemon yogurt & dill - my friend had this but she was forced to share it because I finished my food so fast, I think she felt that I must still be hungry?  So, she gave me a small portion of the dish.  From the amount, I had I can tell it was very good.  I'd have this dish when I return again or maybe I'll have the duck confit.  Oh well, I might have to go back twice.\n\nbanana creme brulee: Okay, well, if you see the pictures of the after we've inhaled this, you could probably guess it's good, it's not good, it's very good.  \n\nProfiterolles: vanilla ice cream, toasted almonds, chocolate sauce - All I can about this is it had ice cream placed inside a crispy, crunchy pastry with chocolate syrup.  The chocolate syrup was just a right amount so it was not drowning in syrup.  I know I said it on all the dishes - it's very good, but that's because it is!\n\nAnyway, I am in no way affiliated to this restaurant nor I know anyone who works here, but I was very impressed.  The place is very nice, clean, comfortable, small but layed out perfectly that it did not feel cramped.  The staff are phenomenal, I don't say this a lot because I think staff have to be friendly and nice because it's the nature of their job actually on other establishment they make you feel they're doing you a favor when they serve you, but not here, and I think the staff that were here that night (not sure if there are different staff on a given night) were genuinely nice.  And of course, the main character in this story of this establishment  are the food.  For the dishes we had, they were all delicious.

Not only does its popularity fill up the joint after about 7 PM, but its food keeps them staying.\n\nMy new friend Sara P. and I decided to try this place after it appeared on our \"New Places in San Francisco\" feed.  After I saw that they had Beef Wellington, I was instantly drawn in and wanted to try it so we thought we would try it together.  That's Yelp people for you.  Kind people that want to make friends and try good food.  My kind of people indeed.  You wanna make friends?  Join Yelp.\n\nIt wasn't an easy feat though, considering our schedules and the fact that the holidays are almost upon us but it was sure worth the trip!\n\nThe authentic French staff is so friendly and welcoming.  Get a drink at the bar first.  They have a great selection of wine and their specialty cocktail is a must try.  They don't have a cocktail list above and beyond this one drink, but this isn't really the place to sit and drink.  This is a place where you will be whisked away to South West France, where the food is good and the wine is plentiful.\n\nWe tried the ravioli appetizer which was a bit different from traditional ravioli.  Much thinner.  Almost like a wonton.  It had some type of beef in it, as well as mushrooms.  I felt that there was too much lemon in the broth, not the ravioli, but it was still delicious.  Especially for an appetizer.\n\nThe COQ AU VIN is a MUST try!  The sauce is so delectable and pairs really well with the Beef Wellington.  I recommend getting the Beef Wellington, eating half of it and mixing it with the COQ AU VIN sauce.  In fact, just request that they put the COQ AU VIN sauce with the Beef Wellington.  So delicious.  Back to the COQ AU VIN though, the meat was ok.  Dark meet that came with a few carrots and gratin potatoes.  Incredibly delectable.  I loved it.\n\nThe Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection.  A flaky pastry puff filled with beef.  I got mine medium, which I don't normally do but I think for this dish you really need to get it this way.  Only because the pastry is so delicate that you need to the beef to be softer.  Too tough and it throws off the balance of the dish.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some sauce stuff that wasn't really as good as the COQ AU VIN.  So really, request the COQ AU VIN sauce!\n\nDessert was good but I didn't want to eat too much so we got something light.  The GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLE TART TATIN was the perfect amount of dessert.  Basically just baked apples with a very thin crust/pastry at the bottom.  The perfect end to your meal.\n\nI really enjoyed this place.  I had great company, I really got to know my new friend, atmosphere and menu weren't too intimidating, staff was great and the food was just so delicious.\n\nI highly recommend to anyone in San Francisco.  Whether you are visiting, have people visiting or just want a delicious holiday meal.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nAmusez-vous!
