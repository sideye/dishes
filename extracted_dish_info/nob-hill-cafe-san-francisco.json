The wait was only about 15-25 minutes so we grabbed a bottle of Frank Family Cab and walked on over.  \n\nI stepped the door and put our name in and the hostess immediately asked if she could open our bottle and bring us some wine glasses outside to the tables while we waited, and this was, unfortunately, where the good service ended.  Drinking our cab outside, we noticed a pair of old twin ladies dressed in identical red cowgirl outfits sitting in the window.  The hostess informed us that this creepy pair liked to dine their twice a week and warned us not to get too close lest we get trapped in a 45 minute conversation about nothing.\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad.  The inside was a little cramped but charming in its own sort of neighborhoody kind of way.  I don't really mind places that don't take reservations, it can actually be a good change of pace.  We sat down and they brought us bread.  The Foccacio was really good.  I started with the carpaccio drizzled in a mustard sauce, capers and lemon.  My girlfriend had the roasted roma tomato and eggplant salad which also featured mounds of slightly cooked feta.  The carpaccio was good and even better when paired with the bread and some of the salad.  The melanzane salad was one of the better parts of the meal and I like carpaccio (the quality of the beef was pretty good) with some greens to lighten it up a little bit.\n\nWhich brings us to dinner.  Because I would literally say that the span between the time they picked up our appetizers and put down our bowls of pasta couldn't have been more than about 30-45 seconds.  This and the fact that the waiter probably hadn't said more than about six words to us up to that point is ultimately what hurt NHC most.  \n\nThe food, though, was pretty good.  My girlfriend got a penne with spicy pomodoro sauce that was actually very flavorful.  I had the spaghetti alla carbonara.  It was an excellent pasta dish.  The romano and butter that coated the spaghetti was rich and delicious and the pancetta added a delicious salty component.  It was finished with some parsley to add some herb influence.  I highly recommend this as long as you feel like indulging yourself.  \n\nTo sum up the rating, the prices and $15 corking fee were very reasonable.  The apps and the spaghetti were all great but not incredible by any stretch.  Ultimately, it was probably the service that kept them from going any higher, but I would recommend giving it a shot.

It fell a little flat, as the asparagus was a little undercooked and the prosciutto seemed like a weak link that barely registered under a lot of marinara. For main courses, we each had pasta, but they couldn't have been more different. I chose the gnocchi Bolognese, which was very good, at times. The problems here were twofold. One, the plating was poor; by serving the dish on a flat plate, the temperature upon service was uneven, so as I worked from one side of the plate to the other it went from tepid to hot to cold. Two, the gnocchi were very unevenly made, so though the smaller pieces were perfect pillowy goodness, larger pieces were a bit gummy. On the positive side, the sauce was rich and meaty.

Years ago, before becoming a SF resident, my dining companions and myself wanted to have dinner & decided to \"wing it.\" The place we intended to go had an incongruous wait time, so we trudged a few blocks over & stumbled upon Nob Hill Cafe, sat in the dining room to the right, in the cozy window booth. \n\nIt's a small family-owned restaurant with a warm & homey feel, clad with a tasteful amount of white lights adorning the exterior, to twinkle at you while you sit & sip your Chardonnay while you wait on a busy night. There are two dining rooms- one (where the main entrance is) is all tables and shares the room with an open kitchen. The other dining room houses the bar and a couple window booths. I've dined on both sides & have found it to be pleasant, admittedly, I have a partiality for a quaint window seat booth. \n\nRecommendations: \nIf you are a fan of garlic-pink-sauce-perfection, I highly recommend the PENNE BETTOLA, my absolute favorite dish here. It's served piping hot, throw some Parmesan and pepper on that bad boy and enjoy! The Tortellini Romana with Pesto sauce is also a good choice (the Pesto sauce is delish!). You can also request a side for your bread. Pizza is Tuscan style & nice if you're in the mood for that. They have daily specials written on the chalk board that have always proven to be worth checking out. \n\nAs for dessert, but of course, there is the house made Tiramisu. If you are Tiramisu'd out, I really recommend the Gelato desserts (Gelato served as a slice of pie, essentially). The Strawberry White Chocolate & Spumoni  will hit the spot!  \n\nIronically, now I live in the neighborhood and one of the Perks (for my tastebuds, if nothing else) is having this lovely restaurant 3 blocks away. Prices are very reasonable and service is lovely. They get very busy for dinner, so if you are under time constraints, just know that there will be a wait. If you're an introvert seeking delectable pasta, try coming during lunch- it's much more mellow, no wait, and you may just score that cozy window seat. \n\nMangia Bene!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-12"}, {"excerpts": ["Others in my party ordered the beef carpaccio and caprese appetisers (both great) and the carbonara, a pizza and the penne bettola with chicken.

However, it was a good thing since we got to experience Nob Hill Cafe.My girl and I walked from Post St. to Nob Hill Cafe. That is not that easy of a trek, but the small journey was worth it.\n\nWe get there and I liked the ambiance of the place from the get go. The host was real friendly. Got our names on the list and told us the wait. We are finally seated and I swear this place can be one of those restaurants that can be featured in one of those shows on Food Network.\n\nMost of the entrees are less than $15. Keep in mind though, there aren't much choices. I was skeptical at first because of this. Also if you see the menu, most do not come with meat. You pay a bit more if you want to add chicken to any pasty entree. But it will still be less than $20.I order a rigatoni pasta with sausage dish that was on the special menu that night. My girl ordered the Linguine alla Vongole (baby clams, white wine lemon sauce).As we wait for our food the complimentary bread was delicious. There was one bread in the bunch in particular. It was of a really good muffin consistency. We were eager to ask for more, but we have learned from our many years of eating out to have self control to save room to really enjoy the main course.\n\nSo we get our food and I will admit I was surprised at the portions. Our dishes were only about $13 each, and I was expecting pretty small portions. However my fat ass was able to get stuffed. If I wasn't so fat I would have been \"satisfied\" with some left over. But, I just continued to eat until I put it all away, then helped my GF finish hers. Everything tasted fresh and clean. When I say \"clean\", it just didn't taste processed or premade like low rated restaurants. The rigatoni dish I ordered is not on the regular menu, but I will recommend it if you see it. My GF's dish I must caution that when they say white wine LEMON sauce, they mean it. The distinct taste of the lemon is there. It may be overwhelming to some, but it was something new and I welcomed it. The baby clams offset some of the sour for a perfect combination.\n\nIn the end, we had a surprisingly great experience here and would definitely come again. Staff was all friendly and right on top of everything even though it was a full house and what seemed like limited staff.

I just didn't hear that - did I? Oh hell no!? \n\nTo all you real SF folks, my sibling and I were wearing our puffy jackets (Patagonia and Marmot if you need to know the brands) and my mom in a black sherpa like hoody all with jeans and flats.

Douche bag server forced me to order for my sis who's out with the nanny taking care of the nephew. Apparently, my sis had already talked to the hostess telling her our situation: 2 people will switch to be with the baby and so the food needs to come when the other two is done so the food won't be cold.\n\nHowever, douche bag server could care less.

Why aren't the kitchen closed for them but for our party, it was?\n\nWTF?\n\nBy then, we were on fire. It was fueled more by our douche bag server literally dumping all our pasta in our table.

I got here at 6:30 and there wasn't a wait at all. We were seated to a small table for two. It was pretty dim inside, but they had a lil candle on the table for a bit of light. It's a bit fancy. They give you some bread with butter while you wait for your meal. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but one of them tasted it. It seems like a muffin like bread. \n\nI ordered a Spaghetti Alla Carbonara. It was really delicious. It cost $12.75, but then I think it was worth it. It was really good. The pasta wasn't hard which I prefer soft speghetti and the sauce was good with the little bits of bacon I believe or some kind of meat. My boyfriend got Trancia Di Calamari. It's a calamari steak and it cost $17.95, which we think wasn't reallt worth it. He didn't really like the steak because the sauce they had for it was really sour which made it taste a bit weird. Other than the sauce being sour, the calamari wasn't that bad. It also came with some pasta and pea. When they serve you the meal. they ask if you want cheese or pepper. \n\nThe service here is really great. They would come around giving us water and asking if everything is okay. The server was very friendly and attentive. \n\nI would definitely come back here when I come visit San Francisco.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-06-04"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Tortellini Romana with pesto.\n\n"], "author": "Edward L.", "review": "This is a great spot for Italian!\n\nWe went on a busy Sunday evening and unfortunately had to wait a bit on a windy night outside.

The wait was only about 15-25 minutes so we grabbed a bottle of Frank Family Cab and walked on over.  \n\nI stepped the door and put our name in and the hostess immediately asked if she could open our bottle and bring us some wine glasses outside to the tables while we waited, and this was, unfortunately, where the good service ended.  Drinking our cab outside, we noticed a pair of old twin ladies dressed in identical red cowgirl outfits sitting in the window.  The hostess informed us that this creepy pair liked to dine their twice a week and warned us not to get too close lest we get trapped in a 45 minute conversation about nothing.\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad.  The inside was a little cramped but charming in its own sort of neighborhoody kind of way.  I don't really mind places that don't take reservations, it can actually be a good change of pace.  We sat down and they brought us bread.  The Foccacio was really good.  I started with the carpaccio drizzled in a mustard sauce, capers and lemon.  My girlfriend had the roasted roma tomato and eggplant salad which also featured mounds of slightly cooked feta.  The carpaccio was good and even better when paired with the bread and some of the salad.  The melanzane salad was one of the better parts of the meal and I like carpaccio (the quality of the beef was pretty good) with some greens to lighten it up a little bit.\n\nWhich brings us to dinner.  Because I would literally say that the span between the time they picked up our appetizers and put down our bowls of pasta couldn't have been more than about 30-45 seconds.  This and the fact that the waiter probably hadn't said more than about six words to us up to that point is ultimately what hurt NHC most.  \n\nThe food, though, was pretty good.  My girlfriend got a penne with spicy pomodoro sauce that was actually very flavorful.  I had the spaghetti alla carbonara.  It was an excellent pasta dish.  The romano and butter that coated the spaghetti was rich and delicious and the pancetta added a delicious salty component.  It was finished with some parsley to add some herb influence.  I highly recommend this as long as you feel like indulging yourself.  \n\nTo sum up the rating, the prices and $15 corking fee were very reasonable.

Years ago, before becoming a SF resident, my dining companions and myself wanted to have dinner & decided to \"wing it.\" The place we intended to go had an incongruous wait time, so we trudged a few blocks over & stumbled upon Nob Hill Cafe, sat in the dining room to the right, in the cozy window booth. \n\nIt's a small family-owned restaurant with a warm & homey feel, clad with a tasteful amount of white lights adorning the exterior, to twinkle at you while you sit & sip your Chardonnay while you wait on a busy night. There are two dining rooms- one (where the main entrance is) is all tables and shares the room with an open kitchen. The other dining room houses the bar and a couple window booths. I've dined on both sides & have found it to be pleasant, admittedly, I have a partiality for a quaint window seat booth. \n\nRecommendations: \nIf you are a fan of garlic-pink-sauce-perfection, I highly recommend the PENNE BETTOLA, my absolute favorite dish here. It's served piping hot, throw some Parmesan and pepper on that bad boy and enjoy! The Tortellini Romana with Pesto sauce is also a good choice (the Pesto sauce is delish!). You can also request a side for your bread. Pizza is Tuscan style & nice if you're in the mood for that. They have daily specials written on the chalk board that have always proven to be worth checking out. \n\nAs for dessert, but of course, there is the house made Tiramisu. If you are Tiramisu'd out, I really recommend the Gelato desserts (Gelato served as a slice of pie, essentially). The Strawberry White Chocolate & Spumoni  will hit the spot!  \n\nIronically, now I live in the neighborhood and one of the Perks (for my tastebuds, if nothing else) is having this lovely restaurant 3 blocks away. Prices are very reasonable and service is lovely. They get very busy for dinner, so if you are under time constraints, just know that there will be a wait. If you're an introvert seeking delectable pasta, try coming during lunch- it's much more mellow, no wait, and you may just score that cozy window seat. \n\nMangia Bene!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The fedelini (long pasta that is thinner than spaghetti) in a simple tomato garlic sauce is great, as is the pesto tortellini (tortellini romana).
