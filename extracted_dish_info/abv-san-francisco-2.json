It's a new bar called [A]lcohol [B]y [V]olume.\" \n\nMr. NSS: \"Not funny....\"\nMe: \"DRINKS ON ME!!!\"\n\nAdmittedly, I felt bad for tricking him into going to a bar when he doesn't even drink. Hey, but I made sure to pick a bar that also serves food. I get my drank on and he gets his grub on. It's a win-win situation.\n\nSoftly opened last Tuesday, ABV took over the old Tokyo Go-Go space and has transformed into a sleek bar serving cocktails from a Bourbon & Branch and Beretta alum with bar bites from a St. Vincent and Bar Tartine alum. They're currently open daily from 2 pm - 2 am. Kitchen closes at 1 am. \n\nThe drink menu is separated into alkie categories: agave, gin/vodka, whiskey, rum/brandy, beer & wine, and no abv (non-alcoholic drinks). Cocktails are $10-$13. And for all you fernet lovers, they have four kinds available!\n\nI shamefully admit that I broke my 2 drink max rule here. I had four. In celebration of Hump Day. Of course. \n\n(1) Mumbai Mule: saffron, vodka, lime, ginger, mint & soda ($10): http://bit.ly/1l88QDZ\n(2) Dartmoor: calvados, lemon, juniper infused honey, basil  ($11): http://bit.ly/1l89eCk\n(3) The Jackal: rye, lemon, pineapple gum, cardamom & egg white ($10): http://bit.ly/1r6sO7R (2 rounds)\n\nLoved all the creativity and fresh ingredients that went into making each artisan cocktail. They were all well-balanced but my favorite was The Jackal. It was nice and stiff just the way I like it so another round was justified. \n\nBar food is usually an afterthought but the bar bites here are not to be missed. Just like the cocktails, the menu is inventive and not anything I've seen at other bars: http://bit.ly/1qKqcKV. We sampled about 1/3rd of the menu and plan to come back for that pimento burger on a housemade sweet potato bun and dolmas made with collard greens and dirty rice. \n\n(1) Kimchee Fritter ($8): http://bit.ly/1nOF6Re\n(2) Falafel Battered Lamb Dog w/ tzatziki sauce ($8): http://bit.ly/1tVR6oL\n(3) Tiny Fish & Chips w/ malt tartar ($8): http://bit.ly/1neQXZV\n(4) Chicken Pot Pie Empanadas ($8): http://bit.ly/1mkBIsf\n\nIf you like pajeon and okonomiyaki, then you will enjoy the kimchee fritter which was a deliciously savory pancake topped with bonito flakes. We really enjoyed the Med-American fusion lamb corndogs which was battered with a falafel corn mixture and fried to a golden brown. Dip it into the deliciously creamy tzatziki sauce and enjoy! I wish there was more of them though. \n\nMr. NSS loved fish & chips so he thoroughly enjoyed his tiny fish & chips (there were 4 pieces of fried dish hidden under the chips). I had a bite of the fish which was perfectly crunchy with a light, airy batter. The chips were nice, thick, and very crunchy. \n\nI really liked the empanada crust which was wonderfully buttery and flaky but I wish the filling embodied more of a \"pot pie\" filling with a savory gravy or maybe as a dipping sauce?\n\nAwesome cocktails and food aside, the staff was fantastic. All the bartenders were very friendly and attentive (hopefully they stay this way as they get busier), and the bar backs kept our water glasses filled. Shout out to Ben, the nicest, and most knowledgeable bartender I've met. Not only did he make my awesome cocktails but he went through the entire food menu with us explaining how each item is made and with what. I also overheard him explaining different types of alkies to the guy next to us. It's clear that the owners did a great and thorough job training the staff. \n\nABV has an industrial warehouse meets contemporary artistic sheekness to it. It's one long bar with two communal tables in the back and another one in the mezzanine. It was already pretty busy by 5 pm so I can imagine how pack this place will be when they grand open. \n\nNeedless to say, I woke up with a hangover this morning. No surprise. That's what I get for breaking my 2 drink max rule. \n\nWell that's what Fernet is for!

I found it on my trusty yelp app while starving most of the morning running on just a Jamba Juice.  Was drinking the night before at SR so I didn't really feel like eating much actual food in the morning.  \"Hot and New\" or something of rather it said on the app.... really high reviews and delectable looking food on the menu got me thinking \"gosh damn I need to try this place.\"  I was also feeling another B-day drink as well coming on; I'm not an excessive drinker since I'm such a lightweight but I love enjoying a nice artisan mixed drink and food pairing.  \n\nThe bartender was extremely knowledgeable and for some odd reason looked very familiar to me; they possibly might have worked at another bar that I have been to....?  Not really sure, haha anyhow.  I was debating between the Land's End and the Pina Verde.  Those drinks and the ingredients initially caught my eye, but I settled on the Pina Verde and was so glad I did.  Not too sweet and very well balanced summer drink; that pineapple helped it a lot I think.  \n\nMy friend did a couple of beer tastings to eventually settle on a house favorite Pilsner... I really forget the name of it now but I did have a taste.  Very good choice; and the type of better I usually enjoy tasting.  We ordered the dishes that looked amazing in the pictures to me and sounded great just reading them off the yelp captions.  \n\nLamb Corndogs with Greek Yogurt sauce?!?  Whoever created that dish here is a freaking genius!  So healthy and clean tasting; not heavy.  \n\nThe Kimchee fritter was so damn good; tastes like all the greatest junk food flavors are laid out on some easy to bite pizza like slices!  OMFG.  You need to come here to try this!  \n\nI enjoyed my drink and water afterwards and I felt much better after a snack and drink. The bathrooms are very clean and we made our way out of the place and onto the next!  Thank you Yelp friends, you know who you are!  HAHA.\n\nSorry to the bartenders if we were acting or talking obnoxiously while we were here; it seemed like a pretty tame place until we came thru haha.

I'd never been before, but hoped for the best. *Ding ding ding!* We have a winner. Upon entering, you'll notice it's buzzing. Bodies are pressed up against the window and walls (*cue song* \"to the windowwwww, to the wallssss!!!\"), people are laughing, music is playing, glasses are clinking...

Another star of the night was their meat and cheese platters. For the meat platter: Virginia speck, sweet coppa, sopressa veneta.

Preferred the later; but both were delicious.\n\nAlso ordered the pulled pork, which was very tasty as well.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-29"}, {"excerpts": ["I selected the Kimchee fritter and pulled pork sandwich.

So many whiskey mixed drinks is that you can often only taste the whiskey and everything else is secondary--the drink was the best of all worlds and I figured with pineapple it would be sweet and it wasn't--multi-dimensional and uber satisfying.

These kids know what they are doing, and not in a holier than thou bartender-beard-vest kind of way (vexing and tiresome, especially in the Mission), or a Tom Cruise re \"Cocktail\" kind of way (which still beats self-righteous steam punk), but in the refreshing \"I know what I'm doing and I'm the best at it but I'm still humble and friendly\" type of way. \n\nOur bartender was the master of multitasking - no small feat in a fully packed house with a complex cocktail list.  Even though our bartender was clearly busy, he greeted us and gave us menus right away.  I was appreciative, because that almost never happens. After perusing the cocktail menu, which divides cocktails by type of alcohol (I.e., vodka/gin, agave, whiskey etc.) I started with the Transamerica Punch, and for my boyfriend, the Tarragon Collins. Both drinks were tasty, but the Tarragon Collins was the winner of the evening for me - with only gin, lemon, tarragon and soda, it was clean and refreshing, and the tarragon worked nicely with that simple combo. \n\nFor the next round, which we were able to order with  relative ease following our first round due to our attentive bartender, I ordered the Mumbai Mule, and the boyfriend ordered the Lefty's Fizz. I loved the Mumbai Mule (just wish it were served in a copper cup), and my boyfriend's Fizz was also good but smoky, so keep that in mind if you aren't a mezcal drinker. I really love egg whites in a drink you know? It's so enjoyable. \n\nMy only regret (even though my motto is \"no ragrets\") is that we didn't order snacks, especially considering our dining experience later that evening, which I will refrain from addressing until I give a certain unnamed establishment a bona fide second chance. But my boyfriend had been to ABV before, and he quite enjoyed the falafel lamb dog. After all, how could that be bad?\n\nAll in all, I advise that you have all of your ill-advised cocktail needs met at ABV on Tuesday nights, Wednesday nights - or hell - all of the nights. Normal Mission crowd: hipsters straight up with a twist of douche. Typical San Francisco cocktail prices, but remember that ATMs in the Mission are on lockdown after 8, but ABV accepts cards.

Another star of the night was their meat and cheese platters. For the meat platter: Virginia speck, sweet coppa, sopressa veneta. For the cheese platter: cottonwood cheddar, sui generis, moolicious blue. Charcuterie at its finest! Did I mention the buttery, grilled bread that comes with? Hello!

It does make it a little harder to split some items such as the lamb dog, but you can get creative with skewers.  Most are $6-10 each.\n1. ABV: bucket of vegetables. We expected something pickled, but this was a bit more oily than I was hoping for. There was a good variety of produce including more interesting things like daikon and a mild ginger. The peppers and eggplant were a bit too oily for me\n2. Padron peppers: hit or miss in spiciness, with some being numbing.\n3. Octopus: wonderful char and tender octopus, topped with a squid ink ranch. The accompanying potatoes had a good crisped outside. \n4. NC style pulled pork sandwich: topped with red slaw inside. This was flavorful, and all the juices soaked into the bun. It's split in half, so it's good for 2 people to share \n5. Falafel lamb dog: the lamb had really good spiced flavor (not spicy), no gaminess, but this needs to be eaten hot so that you don't lose the texture of the breading.  The skewers are kind of big, but they're a bit difficult to split, and each order comes with 2, so plan for 1 skewer of the lamb dog per person\n6. Pimento burger: lots of flavor, super juicy, on the smaller side (but also cheaper). This is also cut in half, good for 2 to share\n\nFavorites of the night: the falafel lamb dog and the pimento cheese burger - both were interesting and had lots of flavor.\n\nI loved sitting at the bar and talking to the bartenders and watching them in action.  I had only heard about their drinks, but the food was unexpectedly good, and I will definitely be coming back!
