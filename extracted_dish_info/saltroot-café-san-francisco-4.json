I got the green juice, which was legit cold press with the usual suspects, plus two of the cheese puffs as an afterthought. They were hot and airy and chewy. How have I gotten this far in life without having experienced their magnificence before?!\n\nI was doing a crammed work session with a friend and working from a laptop, taking advantage of their speedy free WiFi. We knew from the hours listed that the cafe was closing soon, but were trying to crank through some problems. The woman working was soooo nice about it. She brought over two cheese puffs on the house, and very politely said, just to give you a heads up, we will be closing soon. We were there a few minutes after official closing, but she was very nice about it. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're in the hood--nice place to stop for a snack after a Legion of Honor visit.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-11-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I also ordered a green juice, which is tasty and healthy but at $6, more of a treat item for me.
