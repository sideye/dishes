But I was invited to have lunch there by an old neighborhood friend who said that he has been eating here at Heung Yuen for 30 years, since he was 2. I should have known better, especially since he's 32 and can hardly walk already, and his right leg is permanently asleep due to poor circulation. But I wanted to see him, so here I was, feeling like I was walking through \"occupied Hebron\" in \"hipster territory\" heehee, amid the new \"invisible checkpoints,\" the $100 bistro tabs, designed to keep the original locals out, and among all the $20 coffee \"boutiques\" and Birkenstock wearing \"loungers,\" acting like they owned these streets, the hallowed grounds where \"Los Siete De La Raza roamed\" (Google it for more info haha, Google again, such irony,) and the 24th St Boyz held sway, finding my way to Heung Yuen. I sighed when I saw that this place truly hasn't changed from the outside, (and inside) since my childhood, but now, oddly out of place amid the slick themed bistros and bars around it. So anyway, I seldom talk about \"health\" in these reviews because the assumption is that if my butt is in that chair, it ain't gonna kill me (or you.) But this time I have to  seriously consider my own (and your) mortality when I talk about Heung Yuen, and especially that often reviewed  \"sent from heaven\" conqueror of the yelp universe, superhero \"Korean\" chicken. Which btw, truthfully is not really \"Korean\" or associated with real \"Korean chicken\"'in any way shape or form. Those of you that are Korean (from The Big K,) or second generation, and know about this, or If you're under 30 and don't know, ask your parents about \"Pelicana Chicken,\" in Korea, the original, who pioneered and commercialized this type, (deep fried glazed,) the template, the \"real\" no lie, and always the best, and you will know that Heung Yuen's (although yes, crunchy on the outside and yes tender inside,) version's flavors are off, no balance between hot and spicy. An amateur overly sweet snd gratuitously unhealthy, wanna be knock off. A Cantonese cooks mistaken impression of what Korean chicken \"must be like.\" So seriously my hipster settler heroes. Since you put so much money and effort into driving my Latino homiez and their families out of their Mission District homes, and changed its character with your google salaries, then maybe you should start saving some artery space from now on so you can enjoy it, by avoiding this place. So I'm not gonna run with the pack on this one. Two stars max for cheap prices. POSTSCRIPT: After lunch there, I sat on \"the throne\" all afternoon and into the evening and night, and no I ain't the dang Last Emperor. Haha, very funny.  I swear I can tell the noodles in our bland, greasy tomato beef chow mein, were fried in lard. Yes, I can tell the diff. Cuz I'm the noodle (and sushi) king, no lie. \"Noodle G\"?\" Nah that sounds kinda stupid. Anyway, truthfully, after eating here, my toes and fingers were numb (bad circulation) till the next day. So, if you're a twenty something, you ain't gonna be listenin to me about what you put in your body past your tastebuds anyway.

Prices are definitely on the low side.  The tea had a hint of of either tea bag or sink water after taste.  I guess i got used to it.  I got chicken won ton soup without noodles.  It was less than $6.  You get a small bowl with more than enough wontons.  I didn't like the bock choy though.  They left the ends on and they looked brownish/yellow which i take as either aged and unfresh.  Ends should be white.  If you want a full meal definitely get the soup with noodles, it might fill you up more.  I decided to order a rice plate to-go which was the curry chicken.  For dinner, I reheated the food and it was good.  White meat with a curry sauce that is very good.  Not salty and not too rich.  A lot of onions as usual but cooked right.  One thing that i didn't like was it lacked veggies.  I was looking for carrots at least but it had green peppers.  Potatoes would have been nice.  I'd have to say it was better than the soup.

But I was invited to have lunch there by an old neighborhood friend who said that he has been eating here at Heung Yuen for 30 years, since he was 2. I should have known better, especially since he's 32 and can hardly walk already, and his right leg is permanently asleep due to poor circulation. But I wanted to see him, so here I was, feeling like I was walking through \"occupied Hebron\" in \"hipster territory\" heehee, amid the new \"invisible checkpoints,\" the $100 bistro tabs, designed to keep the original locals out, and among all the $20 coffee \"boutiques\" and Birkenstock wearing \"loungers,\" acting like they owned these streets, the hallowed grounds where \"Los Siete De La Raza roamed\" (Google it for more info haha, Google again, such irony,) and the 24th St Boyz held sway, finding my way to Heung Yuen. I sighed when I saw that this place truly hasn't changed from the outside, (and inside) since my childhood, but now, oddly out of place amid the slick themed bistros and bars around it. So anyway, I seldom talk about \"health\" in these reviews because the assumption is that if my butt is in that chair, it ain't gonna kill me (or you.) But this time I have to  seriously consider my own (and your) mortality when I talk about Heung Yuen, and especially that often reviewed  \"sent from heaven\" conqueror of the yelp universe, superhero \"Korean\" chicken. Which btw, truthfully is not really \"Korean\" or associated with real \"Korean chicken\"'in any way shape or form. Those of you that are Korean (from The Big K,) or second generation, and know about this, or If you're under 30 and don't know, ask your parents about \"Pelicana Chicken,\" in Korea, the original, who pioneered and commercialized this type, (deep fried glazed,) the template, the \"real\" no lie, and always the best, and you will know that Heung Yuen's (although yes, crunchy on the outside and yes tender inside,) version's flavors are off, no balance between hot and spicy. An amateur overly sweet snd gratuitously unhealthy, wanna be knock off. A Cantonese cooks mistaken impression of what Korean chicken \"must be like.\" So seriously my hipster settler heroes. Since you put so much money and effort into driving my Latino homiez and their families out of their Mission District homes, and changed its character with your google salaries, then maybe you should start saving some artery space from now on so you can enjoy it, by avoiding this place. So I'm not gonna run with the pack on this one. Two stars max for cheap prices.
