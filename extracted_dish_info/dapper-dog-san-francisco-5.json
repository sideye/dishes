And since it's the Castro, it's not really a stand but probably a placeholder for some failed leather strap-on shop which blows someone's theory that there can never be enough leather strap-on shops in the Castro. But wait, this is the gentrified Castro, so it was probably going to be a baby yoga studio. Instead, it's a compact spot where you can choose from a dozen specialty dogs, all just a little bit more excessive than at least what I want a hot dog to be. Two guys appear to run the spot. They are attentive to the orders but not very personable beyond that.\n\nNot that I was looking for a little chit-chat but even the battery-operated women at Saigon Sandwich say more than these guys. It was not as challenging to decide on which ones I wanted to try. I immediately discounted the Napa Dog which sounds like a cosmic joke with arugula, crumbled blue cheese, diced dried apricots and a house apricot sauce. Say what? The Philly Dog doesn't even sound like a dog. It's a cheesesteak sandwich shaped like a dog, right? And if I wanted a Classic Dog, I would have gone to Top Dog and eaten it off the top of a garbage can like I did back in my Cal Bear days. That pretty much left my order.\n\nThe first was the $6 Chicago Dog. That was quite an extravaganza with a Niman Ranch beef frank topped with chopped onions, tomatoes, yellow mustard, sport peppers, pickle spear, celery salt and a strange neon-green relish, all on a poppy seed bun (photo: http://bit.ly/1DZpkqE). Quite a glowing mess to eat but decent enough. I just had a weird feeling the florescent relish was making me look like an Austin Powers fem-bot extra. I rather liked the $6 Banh Mi Dog, a paean to the classic Vietnamese sandwich with a frank nestled with sliced cucumber, pickled carrot, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, chopped peanuts and a splooge of sriracha mayo (photo: http://bit.ly/1x7qNZE).\n\nI liked the crunch of the ingredients although again, I have to say it was kind of a mess to eat. You'd think two topping-heavy dogs would be enough, but I decided to order a $3 side order of French Fries, and there were quite a few (photo: http://bit.ly/1Fwfj6G). The net result was that I ended up getting three little boxes of food with no offer of a bag, but I managed to snag one of the two stand-up sidewalk tables available to gorge. That was my good fortune since the 17th Street Plaza has reverted back to derelict central with the unexplained disappearance of the red chairs and tables.

The toasted sesame bun nicely cradled the beefy schlong (good snap) and all its toppings. Loved the satisfying crunch from the fresh veggies (pickled carrots, cucumber) and the sprinkling of crunchy peanuts. A generous drizzle of sriracha mayo gave it a spicy creamy finish that had me licking all the corners of my mouth.\n\nYou can't have a good schlong without balls. The Loaded Potato Croquettes (4 for $5) were unlike anything I've ever had: http://bit.ly/1uxxzGN. Fried to a golden brown, the hot balls of bacon and chive mash potatoes had a cheesy center that oozed out like lava upon biting into. Even though they have a different filling than Porto's infamous balls, they may have them beat!\n\nMr. NSS also got into the schlong action with the Wake Up Hot Dog w/ bacon, fried egg, and cheese except he held the cheese ($8): http://bit.ly/1uYhD6i. He loved it. I didn't taste it but I could tell it would be bomb with the oozy egg yolk lacquering the schlong like lube.\n\nIt's a two man show and service was very friendly and efficient.\n\nThere's no seating but I think if they moved their condiment bar to the counter top in the kitchen, at least there will be a small standing area to wolf down that schlong.\n\nParking is very difficult but we got lucky. Next time, I would have someone drop me off while I get the schlongs and balls.\n\nAgain, thank you to Albertino M. for the yummy Banh Mi Hot Dog.

But wait, this is the gentrified Castro, so it was probably going to be a baby yoga studio. Instead, it's a compact spot where you can choose from a dozen specialty dogs, all just a little bit more excessive than at least what I want a hot dog to be. Two guys appear to run the spot.

It was not as challenging to decide on which ones I wanted to try.

The Philly Dog doesn't even sound like a dog. It's a cheesesteak sandwich shaped like a dog, right?

The place is quaint.  It is fairly small, but has a warm feel to it.  For the space they are working in, I commend the fact that they can handle all their orders in a prompt manner.\n\nThe menu has 12 varieties of dogs and a few side menu items like fries and croquettes.

I love banh mi's, but wasn't quite sure how it would be on a dog.  The flavors meshed very well and the freshness of the carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro really cuts through the meatiness of the dog.  The sriracha mayo is a great touch and the crushed peanuts were a nice finish to it.  They killed it with this one.  There were a lot of flavors going on, but not overpowering.  Definitely recommended.\n\nChicago Dog:\nI have never had a Chicago dog, but from what people are saying on here this one is pretty legit.  I enjoyed it like all the other dogs on the menu.  It has neon green relish as if Homer Simpson made your hot dog, onions, mustard, celery salt, and a poppy seed bun.

Pickle spear. Mustard.  I don't really need to write anything else.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  They also don't use cheap, crappy bacon.  \n\nCroquettes:\nGet them if they haven't run out.  They make these by hand and run out pretty quick.

And since it's the Castro, it's not really a stand but probably a placeholder for some failed leather strap-on shop which blows someone's theory that there can never be enough leather strap-on shops in the Castro. But wait, this is the gentrified Castro, so it was probably going to be a baby yoga studio. Instead, it's a compact spot where you can choose from a dozen specialty dogs, all just a little bit more excessive than at least what I want a hot dog to be. Two guys appear to run the spot. They are attentive to the orders but not very personable beyond that.\n\nNot that I was looking for a little chit-chat but even the battery-operated women at Saigon Sandwich say more than these guys. It was not as challenging to decide on which ones I wanted to try. I immediately discounted the Napa Dog which sounds like a cosmic joke with arugula, crumbled blue cheese, diced dried apricots and a house apricot sauce. Say what? The Philly Dog doesn't even sound like a dog. It's a cheesesteak sandwich shaped like a dog, right? And if I wanted a Classic Dog, I would have gone to Top Dog and eaten it off the top of a garbage can like I did back in my Cal Bear days. That pretty much left my order.\n\nThe first was the $6 Chicago Dog. That was quite an extravaganza with a Niman Ranch beef frank topped with chopped onions, tomatoes, yellow mustard, sport peppers, pickle spear, celery salt and a strange neon-green relish, all on a poppy seed bun (photo: http://bit.ly/1DZpkqE). Quite a glowing mess to eat but decent enough. I just had a weird feeling the florescent relish was making me look like an Austin Powers fem-bot extra. I rather liked the $6 Banh Mi Dog, a paean to the classic Vietnamese sandwich with a frank nestled with sliced cucumber, pickled carrot, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, chopped peanuts and a splooge of sriracha mayo (photo: http://bit.ly/1x7qNZE).\n\nI liked the crunch of the ingredients although again, I have to say it was kind of a mess to eat. You'd think two topping-heavy dogs would be enough, but I decided to order a $3 side order of French Fries, and there were quite a few (photo: http://bit.ly/1Fwfj6G). The net result was that I ended up getting three little boxes of food with no offer of a bag, but I managed to snag one of the two stand-up sidewalk tables available to gorge. That was my good fortune since the 17th Street Plaza has reverted back to derelict central with the unexplained disappearance of the red chairs and tables.

Thank you, Albertino M.!\n\nDapper Dog is a closet sized shop selling creative twists on the classic schlong...hot dogs taken to the next level to be exact. They're open every day until 11 pm and until 2:30 am on weekends. On the menu are 10 hot dogs, from a Classic dog, Chicago dog, to a Philly dog (w/ cheese steak), and even a Breakfast dog (w/ eggs, bacon & cheese). You get a choice of a Niman ranch beef, chicken, or veggie hot dog. Hot dogs are $5-$8 which is reasonable considering Niman ranch beef hotdogs go for over $4 apiece. There's also two sides available; savory side: Loaded Potato Croquettes ($5) and a sweet side: Cinnamon Roll Waffle ($3). CC's accepted.\n\nMy Banh Mi Dog ($6) was incredibly delicious with all the authentic layers of a legit banh mi: salty, sour, spicy, and sweet: http://bit.ly/1Dd8AO0. The toasted sesame bun nicely cradled the beefy schlong (good snap) and all its toppings. Loved the satisfying crunch from the fresh veggies (pickled carrots, cucumber) and the sprinkling of crunchy peanuts. A generous drizzle of sriracha mayo gave it a spicy creamy finish that had me licking all the corners of my mouth.\n\nYou can't have a good schlong without balls. The Loaded Potato Croquettes (4 for $5) were unlike anything I've ever had: http://bit.ly/1uxxzGN. Fried to a golden brown, the hot balls of bacon and chive mash potatoes had a cheesy center that oozed out like lava upon biting into. Even though they have a different filling than Porto's infamous balls, they may have them beat!\n\nMr. NSS also got into the schlong action with the Wake Up Hot Dog w/ bacon, fried egg, and cheese except he held the cheese ($8): http://bit.ly/1uYhD6i. He loved it. I didn't taste it but I could tell it would be bomb with the oozy egg yolk lacquering the schlong like lube.\n\nIt's a two man show and service was very friendly and efficient.\n\nThere's no seating but I think if they moved their condiment bar to the counter top in the kitchen, at least there will be a small standing area to wolf down that schlong.\n\nParking is very difficult but we got lucky. Next time, I would have someone drop me off while I get the schlongs and balls.\n\nAgain, thank you to Albertino M. for the yummy Banh Mi Hot Dog. Since I enjoyed it so much, the right and only thing to do was to pay it forward. I hope the next person enjoyed their free schlong as much I did. And, I'm hoping they paid it forward as well.

I've also tried the Reuben Dog.   While the menu is very creative, I have to say that \"hot dog\" doesn't necessarily \"go\" with some of these themes.  I mean, there's a reason why when you order a Banh Mi at a Vietnamese restaurant (or a Cubano at a Cuban place), it never comes with a hot dog option.  Hot dog is a greasier, saltier meat than the meats normally put in these sandwiches.  That said, I order them and I largely like them, but have had a few moments where I've thought \"I'd rather be eating a Banh Mi instead of a Banh Mi hot dog\" if you catch my drift.

The poppy seed bun was also a lot fresher and soft this time.  The dog is still enormous and a bit hard to fit in my mouth, but I'm gonna chalk that up to local fare, we like our big wieners in the Castro.\n\nDespite my last review being entirely on the Chicago Dog, now that I can get over that mental hurdle and move on I think it'd only be fair if I review this place as a not just a place to get Chicago Dogs but as a place of many great hot dog offerings.\n\nThe Bahn Mi Dog is really great, despite sounding like a potentially bad idea.  The ingredients are very well balanced, which is super important in a hot dog, and gives a very consistent flavor across all bites.  The beef dog mixes very well with the cilantro and sriracha mayo and the chopped peanuts surprisingly go very well in the mix.  Another great SF fusion of street food and SE asian cuisine, definitely recommend trying it.\n\nThe Reuben Dog was pretty good, very much what you'd expect in terms of taste.  I think for the most part I'll be sticking with pastrami and rye for my Reubens (Rossi's Deli across the street has a pretty good one), though I can see myself having a hankering for this again.\n\nThe french fries are pretty standard fare, nothing fresh cut or anything, but they also hot, crisp, and plentiful so I definitely can't complain.  That they are now able to also offer fries in such a tiny hole in the wall is a plus in my book.

I had seen the signs up, but was happy to see it had opened up after seeing \"under construction\" a few weeks before.  I'm always down to try new places and how often do you see a hot dog spot?  The place is quaint.  It is fairly small, but has a warm feel to it.  For the space they are working in, I commend the fact that they can handle all their orders in a prompt manner.\n\nThe menu has 12 varieties of dogs and a few side menu items like fries and croquettes. I like it. It's simple and easy to maneuver and I appreciate the fact that there aren't 30 things to choose from. They use quality Niman Ranch dogs and have other options like veggie or chicken dogs for you heathens out there.  \n\nWhat I have had so far:\n\nBanh Mi Dog:\nI would say this is my favorite one.  I love banh mi's, but wasn't quite sure how it would be on a dog.  The flavors meshed very well and the freshness of the carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro really cuts through the meatiness of the dog.  The sriracha mayo is a great touch and the crushed peanuts were a nice finish to it.  They killed it with this one.  There were a lot of flavors going on, but not overpowering.  Definitely recommended.\n\nChicago Dog:\nI have never had a Chicago dog, but from what people are saying on here this one is pretty legit.  I enjoyed it like all the other dogs on the menu.  It has neon green relish as if Homer Simpson made your hot dog, onions, mustard, celery salt, and a poppy seed bun.  Pretty traditional hot dog items for the most part so you can't go wrong.\n\nReuben Dog:\nI actually liked this more than I thought.  It has sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, and swiss cheese.  I was expecting it to make me feel heavy and full afterwards because of the swiss cheese, but the sauerkraut really helps with that by cutting through with its tanginess.\n\nSalty Dog:\nBACON.  Pickle spear. Mustard.  I don't really need to write anything else.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  They also don't use cheap, crappy bacon.  \n\nCroquettes:\nGet them if they haven't run out.  They make these by hand and run out pretty quick.  It's a delicious, crispy potato ball that has cheese oozing out of it.  \n\n\nThe staff is super-friendly, they've provided a fresh take on hot dogs, and they're open late which is nice too since most places in the city have a tendency to close early.

I know, you're thinking that's not saying much, because we mostly make stupid decisions after drinking, but trust me Dapper Dog is amazing!  So much better than the alternative pizza places nearby.  My friend was having his birthday at nearby The Lookout...yep Sunday day drinking.  I stayed for a few hours, but then my stomach started to hurt; I knew I should have eaten beforehand!  \n\nSo we knew we were going to hit up Dapper Dog afterwards.  We decided on getting an order of the potato croquettes ($5 for 4), The Wake Me Up ($8)  for me and the Philly Cheesesteak ($8) for him.  I asked for to go since I didn't know if I'd finish my hot dog.  They charge 15 cents per box (his and mine) just an FYI.  I don't think they charged for the box for the croquettes since they best fit in there vs the hot dog dish thingy.  They let you choose from a veggie dog, chicken dog, or a beef dog. After a few minutes are dogs were ready to devour.  My Wake Me Up, looked slightly different than Cherylynn's pic.  Hers was a whole over easy egg, while mine was scrambled egg chopped up, and topped with bacon pieces, and grilled onion, and shredded cheese.  A lot of the cheese hadn't melted all the way though.  Nonetheless it was delicious and totally settled my stomach!  The hot dog though filled with fat filled ingredients actually wasn't that greasy.  His Philly Dog was pretty awesome too, beef hot dog topped with lots of sirloin beef pieces, melted provolone and onions and jalapenos.  A few minutes after we got our dogs our potato croquettes were ready.  These were like fried mash potato balls with diced up bacon and chives and filled with cheese.  They were piping hot and golden brown.  The cheese oozed out when we bit into them.  Overall, a very solid and satisfying affordable meal!
