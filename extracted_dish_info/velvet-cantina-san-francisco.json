After noting the presence of a full bar and late hours it seemed like it would be hard for the V.C. to walk away with anything less than 4 stars. However, with a few adjustments, I think that the cantina can be vastly improved.\n\nGrouse #1-Salsa is hurting in the spice department. I asked if they had anything spicier, nope. Then asked for some chopped jalapenos. Our waiter was compassionate in regards to our spice plight and eventually brought us a bottle of habanero hot sauce. I liked the hot sauce b/c it wasn't a vinegar based hot sauce like tapatio or tabasco, but more pureed chiles. It was also fiery hot.\n\nGrouse numero dos-Tried the serrano infused tequila with cucumber puree drink. The cucumber elements were refreshing but I found the serrano tequila to be acrid and harsh tasting, perhaps a squeeze of lime could balance out the drink. I think I would go margarita next time. \n\nGrouse 3-The chicken avocado enchiladas ($10.99) have jalapeno cream sauce listed in the description. I prefer enchiladas that arrive in a pool of sauce and with just a squiggle of sauce on the top, these guys were a bit dry. Without a hearty napping of sauce, the tortillas became tough after a few minutes on the table.\n\nOk, grousing aside, I *loved* the chips at Velvet Cantina. If we could get a spicy salsa option, I would be there frequently for chips and drinks if not more. Warm, tender cornbread forms the base for tasty pollo asado sopes ($5.99). The white tortilla soup ($4.99) was a large enough portion to share. Shreds of chicken were hidden under the submerged sour cream empanada. My fellow eater enjoyed the soup and I was more ambivalent about it, nothing too exciting, but a decent start to a meal. After reading various reviews in the weeklies, I recalled people mentioning bland beans. As a refritos lover, I hoped that this had been improved upon. Refried pinto beans were creamy enough and went well with the freshly fried chips. \n\nI think that the cantina could be a successful fit to the neighborhood with a few improvements (spicier!).

A big part of it has to do with their amazing house-made chips. They're thick, perfectly salted, and stay crispy for an unusually long time even after being drenched in the perfect amount of luscious chile con queso, creamy sour cream, and chunky guacamole. The spicy chorizo added great flavor and is definitely an add-on must.

Nachos aren't really a common order for me, but these were pretty darn good and I can't think of another place where I've had better. \n\nI also tried the Chicken Enchilada plate, which came with two enchiladas and generous scoops of rice, black beans, and pickled cabbage. The enchiladas were kind of small, but the cilantro pesto on top made up for it. Not the most flavorful or memorable dish, but it was still good. The food wasn't at all greasy and with the nachos, was a perfect amount to share between two people. Washed it all down with a raspberry margarita and I was a happy camper. \n\nVelvet Cantina is either a great happy hour spot or a casual sit-down Mexican type of joint, not a grab n' go burrito spot. The servers are super chill and you'll occasionally catch them rocking out to the music, which by the way, was a great mix of jukebox classics, 90's hits, and current radio favorites.

With so many great taquerias in the area, I was curious to see what could possibly make these so amazing.\n\nThere's only so much you can do with nachos, but Velvet Cantina really does make it an art. A big part of it has to do with their amazing house-made chips. They're thick, perfectly salted, and stay crispy for an unusually long time even after being drenched in the perfect amount of luscious chile con queso, creamy sour cream, and chunky guacamole. The spicy chorizo added great flavor and is definitely an add-on must.  I like how the toppings are evenly distributed and heavily drizzled on top instead of being unevenly slopped all over the place. All the chips had a generous and even amount of toppings, which led to a continuous stream of satisfying bites. At $14 they're a bit pricey, but completely worth it. I almost didn't get the nachos because I was already satisfied with my basket of free chips, but don't settle! Take the plunge!!! Are they the best nachos I've ever had? Probably. Nachos aren't really a common order for me, but these were pretty darn good and I can't think of another place where I've had better. \n\nI also tried the Chicken Enchilada plate, which came with two enchiladas and generous scoops of rice, black beans, and pickled cabbage. The enchiladas were kind of small, but the cilantro pesto on top made up for it. Not the most flavorful or memorable dish, but it was still good. The food wasn't at all greasy and with the nachos, was a perfect amount to share between two people. Washed it all down with a raspberry margarita and I was a happy camper. \n\nVelvet Cantina is either a great happy hour spot or a casual sit-down Mexican type of joint, not a grab n' go burrito spot. The servers are super chill and you'll occasionally catch them rocking out to the music, which by the way, was a great mix of jukebox classics, 90's hits, and current radio favorites. Of course, I highly recommend the Velvet Nachos! My one regret is that I didn't have room for dessert.

I don't drink tequila often, but when I do, I enjoy the smooth taste of Herradura (I promise I'm not being paid to say this LOL). Hence, the \"Perfect Margarita\" was my favorite.

It's crowded on a Saturday night, but not overwhelming. Overall, the food is not bad. It just doesn't live up to the hype. And while the prices here are better than many sit-down Mexican restaurants, the food still costs more than it's worth. \n\nOur reservation was for a party of 7. We were seated promptly. The servers were great. The food came out very quickly (too quickly, to be honest... not a lot of time or care could have gone into its preparation).\n\nWhat people in our party had:\n\nChips and salsa -- Chips were great. Salsa was tasty, yet utterly devoid of spice. Chili's makes a spicier house salsa. \n\nQueso bowl -- Not bad, but again, just melted cheese. No punch whatsoever. \n\nGuacamole -- Fresh but boring. Needed salt, lime, and flavor. \n\nAchiote steak tacos -- Very bland. When you're charging $12 for two tacos, you expect to not need to put a half-pint of Cholula hot sauce on in order to taste anything. \n\nCactus enchiladas -- These came highly recommended. They were slimy and devoid of flavor. She didn't even want to finish them. \n\nChicken salad -- Lettuce, tomato, beans, and chicken. Blah.\n\nChili verde enchiladas -- The standout hit! The guy who ordered this liked them very much. \n\nNachos with chicken -- Nothing on the dinner menu stood out to me, so I ordered the nachos for my meal. They were good-ish. I don't know what they were using for cheese, but I didn't much care for it. However, all ingredients were evenly dispersed, so no hunting for veins of salsa or sour cream. If I went there again, this is probably what I'd order. \n\n...but I don't plan on ever going to Velvet Cantina again.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating because good food is good food. Period. Hell, I like Mission Chinese Food and most people know that it's not legit Chinese food but at least it's somewhat well-executed. Velvet Cantina, however, couldn't even execute basic Mexican staples like rice and beans properly. It was like prison food. Well, at least how I envisioned prison food to be like if I ever got arrested for public indecency.\n\nWe started with the Chicken Tortilla Soup w/ a Sour Cream Empanada ($6.99): http://bit.ly/13isQw1. It was no bueno and tasted like chicken bouillon soup; VERY artificial, salty, and with very few shreds of chicken. The best part was the empanada and only because it was fresh out of the fryer. The Queso Macho w/ Chorizo & Guacomole ($8.49) fared better: http://bit.ly/13isVzG. How can you resist a melding of ooooey gooey cheese with delicioso mildly spicy bits of chorizo? The thick tortilla chips held up well to this sinfully good dip. If you must order something to coat your stomach from the margaritas, get this!\n\nMy entree of Chicken Mole w/ Refried Beans & Rice ($12.79) was another disappointment: http://bit.ly/15eAzPu. Although the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, the mole sauce was unappetizing. While mole sauce should be richly thick, Velvet Cantina's mole was grossly thick; almost pasty with a very aggressive flavor profile (too much cinnamon and coriander?). I've grown to love refried beans but these were just awful with a chunky, toothpaste-like texture. And then, there was the mushy and clumpy rice. How can you mess up rice? *Sigh*\n\nI wasn't impressed with the chewy Carne Asada either which I took a bite off from Mr. NSS' plate. Two of my friends ordered the much raved about Chicken Avocado Enchiladas.

Holla!\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Reservations were easily made on the same day.\n*2 stars for the food and 4 stars for the service.\n*Seems to be a place to go for drinks and not for the food especially if you're use to legit Mexican food. \n*Upbeat and friendly service (the saving grace). Our water glasses never went below the halfway point which is always a good sign of attentive service.\n*Saw zero natives dining here. Are there even any Mexican natives who even reviewed Velvet Cantina? =/\n*2 very dim dining areas: a bar area with 5 tables and a back dining area with 7 booths and 2 tables.\n*Difficult street parking.

What is it about that name?  I love it!  Velvet Cantina.  I didn't even ask if the food was good.\n\nSo we get there and are blessed with rockstar parking within 50 feet of the front door which had to be a sign of good things to come.  As we walked up, I noticed a really cool door and signs that say things like \"Edibles and Elixirs\".  I liked it already.\n\nWe walked inside and we were basically in the bar/lounge area.  We were immediately greeted by a nice woman who asked if we wanted to eat dinner.  We responded that we would like dinner, and she promptly seated us at the perfect booth in the middle of the room.  Looking around, I really liked the feel.  There were red lights hanging down from the ceiling and an interesting bar.  This is the type of place that immediately transforms you once you are in the door and I really liked the ambiance.  My girlfriend agreed.\n\nI believe that there is another dining area that is not attached to the bar (with separate entrance) but we did not notice that until we were leaving.  I only post this because a family might want to dine on the other side, away from the booze.\n\nFirst, the chips rolled out with salsa.  The chips were thick, crispy, and very tasty.  The salsa was thick and chunky...much thicker and chunkier than any restaurant salsa I have ever had.  It was delicious.  We had to have more chips and salsa brought to the table because we ate them so quickly.\n\nNext, it was the ceviche.  Yum!  There were mangos in it, which added a pop of flavor that was very good, and I am not normally a fan of mango.  This plate lasted about half as long as the first basket of chips.\n\nFinally, our main courses arrived.  I had the chicken avocado enchiladas and my girlfriend had the steak tacos.  We both got the refried beans and rice that come with.  They also offered black beans and something else that I can't remember...maybe charro beans, but I am a die-hard refried bean guy.

I ordered the chicken avocado enchiladas which sounded kind of boring, but were a party in my mouth. The Mole dish is hands down the best things to order even though it is SUPER spicy. The sauce reeks (in a good way) of cinnamon. The meat is so tender that it falls apart at the sign of a knife and fork. To top the night off, we attempted to eat the flaming Smore nachos. Very clever, dudes. I wish I had enough room to fit it all in my bellay, but sadly I did not. I think i did walk out of there with an extra arse and a few hundred extra pounds. \n\nCome here for a date night or to catch up with the honeys.

After noting the presence of a full bar and late hours it seemed like it would be hard for the V.C. to walk away with anything less than 4 stars. However, with a few adjustments, I think that the cantina can be vastly improved.\n\nGrouse #1-Salsa is hurting in the spice department. I asked if they had anything spicier, nope. Then asked for some chopped jalapenos. Our waiter was compassionate in regards to our spice plight and eventually brought us a bottle of habanero hot sauce. I liked the hot sauce b/c it wasn't a vinegar based hot sauce like tapatio or tabasco, but more pureed chiles. It was also fiery hot.\n\nGrouse numero dos-Tried the serrano infused tequila with cucumber puree drink. The cucumber elements were refreshing but I found the serrano tequila to be acrid and harsh tasting, perhaps a squeeze of lime could balance out the drink. I think I would go margarita next time. \n\nGrouse 3-The chicken avocado enchiladas ($10.99) have jalapeno cream sauce listed in the description.

If we could get a spicy salsa option, I would be there frequently for chips and drinks if not more. Warm, tender cornbread forms the base for tasty pollo asado sopes ($5.99). The white tortilla soup ($4.99) was a large enough portion to share. Shreds of chicken were hidden under the submerged sour cream empanada. My fellow eater enjoyed the soup and I was more ambivalent about it, nothing too exciting, but a decent start to a meal. After reading various reviews in the weeklies, I recalled people mentioning bland beans. As a refritos lover, I hoped that this had been improved upon. Refried pinto beans were creamy enough and went well with the freshly fried chips. \n\nI think that the cantina could be a successful fit to the neighborhood with a few improvements (spicier!).

Fresh pineapple (not just juice) was blended with tequila and tasted sooo good, not too sweet. Our one friend said it was pretty strong, but I didn't really think so? I actually seasoned mine with a little of the chile salt, which gave it some welcome heat. Towards the end, I did get some threads of pineapple at the bottom, which was a little unpleasant. After that first pitcher was drained, we decided to get one more but chose the House version instead. It was actually really good too. We did have to ask for salted rims on the glasses though (salt was also missing from round 1 - it would have been awesome had we had some of that chile salt on the rims!) which irked me a little. The other thing that was irksome was that shortly before 11, our server asked us to cash out with him because he was starting his end-of-night paperwork.

There were still a few customers in addition to our table and we all hung out for at least another half hour, so it was kind of awkward to have had to pay already.

I had the avocado chicken enchiladas, yum!  We also shared the cornbread sopes, excellent...I just wish they gave you more!  All four of us indulged in the smores nachos at the end.  All I can say is- be prepared to share!  So much sweetness, so rich!  But oh so good.  The only reason for the four star rating (rather than a five) is the location.  Nothing against them but I'm sorry, just not a fan of that area and therefore don't know if/ when I'll be back but please don't let that discourage you from giving it a try!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-02-18"}, {"excerpts": ["We were on the verge of food coma but not to the point where we couldn't partake of the crazy tasty smores nachos.

We started with margaritas which were well-made, tasty and strong.  They offered us a sample of the raspberry marg which was also pretty good - but I like my margs simple.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  When our whole party arrived they'd already prepared a table for us on the restaurant side so we moved over there, where our waitress was also friendly and attentive - I think it helped that the place was not full,  towards the end of a Wednesday night.  Our party split a plate of nachos and a quesadilla - the nachos were outstanding and everyone in our group loved them.  We all ordered entrees but after another pitcher of margs and all those appetizers, we had a hard time finishing the generous portions, even though they were all very tasty.  Our leftovers were promptly wrapped up to go, and though we were full, we figured a group could still demolish a dessert, so we had the smores nachos (I saw no listing of the peanut butter nachos other reviews have mentioned, but it was dark and I was drunk...).
