Meh. But through the persistence of, and devotion to the place by my colleagues, I've come to enjoy some key dishes here. \n\nFirst, every cold day requires the curry chicken/beef-stew noodle soup. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=Mpm8m5_SikWJxUealEaa9w) Alternatively you can switch out noodles for rice. Like all good South East Asian curries, it's a rich coconut milk based curry, not too spicy, just a soul warming meal. While the chicken is more typical, I really like the beef stew - the slow braised meat just falls apart in your mouth. \n\nThe next go-to choice is the chicken and shrimp claypot rice. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=PoY8g3eW4rl_8P9gnc0VUg) It's a nostalgic taste perhaps but the combination of shrimp, chicken, bok choy, and crispy rice covered in hoisin sauce just hits the right spot. The secret we believe has to be salted fish. We know it's in there somewhere for a little more savory oomph. \n\nOther good choices include the imperial rolls, fresh spring rolls withshrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=67T22k-DXpOvVJEbRSE6fQ), Vietnamese \"potstickers\", sauteed mixed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=8q-EaHfZBYDCh2dfbKH4Wg), bun with imperial rolls and pork (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=RYnkkR04S0gpz9mjhxUkYw), beef stew noodle soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=teMiyofONhsHWRdt0xSHMg), and beef pho (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=Is3NxRcak9L95jPWhZwlIg).
