I'm a regular (I go to Stable about every other week, and have been doing so for the past year or so), and am always surprised at my final bill, the size of my food/drinks, and how quickly (or not) my food arrives.  I don't get the sense that new employees are trained very thoroughly.  One example of this: the Mate Latte.  Usually it comes in a large cup, and is perfect - just sweet enough, the mate is perfectly steeped, etc. Sometimes though, it's in a small cup (for the same price!), no honey, and too bitter to drink.  The only pattern seems to be that new employees in particular really struggle with making the drink, which makes me think that more training before they get behind the counter would be helpful. \n\nOr the french press coffee. There are two prices: $2 for a small, and $2.75 for a large.  However, there was a period of time when suddenly all \"for here\" prices for coffee changed to $2.75 for a small coffee, no refills. I asked why, and was told by a new employee, \"It's just how we do it here.\"   So now I just order my coffee in a to-go cup to avoid the confusion, even if I plan to drink it at Stable (saves me .$75 too, if I order a small). \n\nI've also gotten basic sandwiches that should come with ham, without any ham (and lots of eye-rolling if asked for a side of ham to add to the sandwich).  Or  wraps that are missing bacon. Or sandwiches on a bagel that should be on a croissant.\n\nSometimes I'm overcharged, sometimes undercharged. I'll point this out if I notice while I'm there, but, with a menu that's relatively straightforward (at least for brunch), I'm not sure why there's so much variance in the bill.  \n\nThe people behind the counter can be friendly and nice, or completely rude. \n\nI keep coming to Stable though because the food is just SO GOOD. Best eggs in the city. As long as you're prepared to deal with inconsistency (I try to think of it as an adventure!), you'll enjoy your meal here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-07-15"}, {"excerpts": ["However, on several occasions they just pulled one of the hours-old display sandwiches out of the case, heat it up and charge you as if it'd been fresh (part of the price is for freshness and not getting sick from food poisoning, no?)\n\n"], "author": "Paul E.", "review": "Short: They violate food safety regulations, and they're sloooooow.\n\nLong: It's a good thing so many people have given up on this place, I can't imagine how slow they'd be if everyone who likes the food/coffee actually went there and you had to wait even longer to order. I can't tell you how many people say the same thing to me about this place... \"good food/coffee but it takes *forever*!\"\n\nThere's rarely much of a line there, which gives you a false sense of how long it will take. \n\nI like the food, generally. However, on several occasions they just pulled one of the hours-old display sandwiches out of the case, heat it up and charge you as if it'd been fresh (part of the price is for freshness and not getting sick from food poisoning, no?)\n\nI'd easily change my rating to a 5 if they hired cooks who knew how to hustle and didn't try to get away with serving me old, contaminated, soggy food from the display case!! It's not just gross and insulting, it's dangerous. The staff have obviously never been trained in food safety. Even BK and McD's throw their food out if it sits around for a fraction of the time Stable thinks is acceptable. I've taken culinary arts classes and know how little time it takes bacteria to grow at room temp... \n\nI think they're trying to solve their speed problem by cutting food safety corners though. If they try to pull the display model after you order, stop them! Tell them they're nasty, lazy and unsafe for trying to get away with that. It's not just rude, they are risking your health and they need to stop!\n\nIf you don't, you'll end up with indigestion - at the very least.\n\nIf they can get their stuff together, it'd be nice to see them stay around. Do they not realize how many more people per day they'd serve (and more money they'd make) if the speed of service were improved?? People who like them would stop avoiding them.

After getting tips from Yelp about their free wifi, cheap pannini, and generally friendly ambiance, I decided to make a visit and put in a few hours of work. The structural layout came as advertised; it had a cute outdoor seating area next to the caf\u00e9 and large windows with a second floor to host laptop users. \n\nThe place is cute and tiny with a long line of people waiting to order that tend to cluster from the entrance to the register. The menu was posted behind the staircase that was invisible until you get to the register. I was attracted to several menu items that included their sandwich items ($8) and their good looking empanadas behind the case. Instantly excited about the prospect of a productive afternoon, I ordered a mushroom and a spinach empanadas ($4.50 each) and pressed coffee ($2.25). It wasn't until I received the food and went upstairs I realized that the caf\u00e9 did not have any plugs on the walls and the other laptop users could only stay as long as their battery life would let them. What a bummer. They also ran out of soy--until Monday--so my coffee tasted horrible even with brown sugar added. My empanadas were decent but quite expensive. It was not warm all the way through to the middle, but the fillings were still pretty tasty. I thought it tasted better with the side of smoky chipotle sauce that had a nice kick, but otherwise I wished I had ordered their sandwiches or simply go elsewhere for a better meal.\n\nService was rushed and I felt compelled to bus my own dishes even when I had already left a tip. My visit was brief as I didn't even bother to break open my laptop. It was a wasted effort as I had to trek across town to find another caf\u00e9 to get my work going. I thought their food was decent but not worthwhile when nearby options are better and more affordable.
