I got the Penne Pomodoro at first - the pasta was kinda mushy and it lacked flavor and sauce. But the second time, I got the Farfalle Primavera - MUCH better. Pasta was cooked al dente. Veggies weren't super grilled, but crunchy - just the way I like it. Tons of sauce to go around.\n\nThe service is always great. Even when I'm just getting in line, the cashier lady acknowledges me and smiles as she's helping someone else.\n\nJust one complaint - I ordered the Classic Caesar and added Grilled Chicken. In the instructions, I asked for dressing, croutons, and cheese on the side (per other Yelper's suggestion) but it all came in the same box. It's not super important for me from a food standpoint, but from a service standpoint, it's important to pay attention to specific requests.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-04-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Just this past week, I tried the $8 Farfalle Primavera (see my photo), and it tasted like it was cooked about three days ago and nuked just for me.
