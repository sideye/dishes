Definitely makes for a fine Friday or Saturday post-dinner spot. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with ordering anything on their drinks menu but as almost every other review suggests, the Basil Gimlet is the unadulterated winner. It's sweet, tangy and quite strong, just the way I love my cocktails. \n\nSo the next time you're on a clubbing or barhopping spree in the Tenderloin, stop by Rye for some spectacular cocktails. \n\nHappy Drinking, Yelpers!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The Santiago Sun was a delicious alternative to all of the whiskey drinks on the menu but the Basil Gimlet really won me over."], "author": "Kari G.", "review": "It's easy to walk by this place and not even know its there.

It's a small, inconspicuous spot and easy to miss if you're not paying attention. First thing I noticed on the way in was a homeless man bugging the patrons hanging out on the smoking patio for money. Ah, the night scene in SF...\n\nInside: For a Saturday night, it wasn't too crowded. My group of seven people managed to snag a table after about 30 minutes of standing around. I hardly noticed the wait though, since it took me about that long to get the bartender's attention anyway.\n\nDrinks: Specialty drinks run about $9-$10, but I have to admit they are quite good. Recommend the basil gimlet and the blood and sand cocktail.\n\nThe bartender: I was tended to by a guy bartender, who I have to call an elitist. He refused to make my friend a long island, and responded with some kind of comment about how he doesn't make \"those kind of drinks.\" Ooookay. Sure he mixes up a mean-ass vodka tonic (glass of vodka with a splash of tonic), but seriously, don't be a prick. Given the cocktail menu, you wouldn't think a long island would be an issue.  It's not like we asked for a round of daquiris.\n\nThe venue: The bar gets quite crowded, so good luck getting in there to order your drinks. You're better off grabbing the cocktail waitress and having her bring them to you. The music is loud, but not to the point where you can't have a conversation with the people sitting next to you.\n\nFinal verdict: 3 stars for tasty drinks, but relatively bad service.

Gorgeous bar, bi-level and with an \"outdoor\" space that is out front but separated by a bars from the public, kind of like an advertisement for the good times within.  Easy bar to get around in, even when crowded.  Someone did their homework when setting up this space.\n\nOn to the drinks - I knew it was gin drinks for the evening, but had no idea they would be FREE during the event - hot damn!  Me and Snoop sippin' on gin and juice, laaaid back!  Or, as Mojo Nixon would have put it, we were in a gin guzzlin' frenzy.  I ended up having a gin and tonic to really get a taste for Damrak before I moved on to more complicated drinks, and it's very good, very smooth gin.  Jessica had the gin martini, which was good, but I wasn't in a martini mode at that point.  Then I went for a gin and sin, but the wait at the bar was so long (very busy at that point) that I settled for another cucumber gimlet that she was making and Jess had the basil gimlet.  Both were outstanding.  Then we more or less gave up on getting to the bar until I started up a conversation Carol Ann, a promoter making her way around the place, when she mentioned Yelp and Nish.  She was smart, fun, and we had a great discussion about Yelp and the effects of its' reviews which were pretty positive.  Anyway, long story short, that sweet lady got us gin-gin mules like, pronto.  What a sweetheart, and what a tasty drink!  5 stars for the event, Damrak, Nish for inviting us, and Carol Ann!!\n\nLast note: the female bartender (didn't get her name, no time) there is top notch and deserves whatever tips you can manage.  She's quick with her drinks, high energy, meticulous with her mixing, cute as all get out, and totally sweet.  Great energy behind the bar here.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-10-10"}, {"excerpts": ["At 7x7's mandate, I had the basil gimlet, and it was among the best crisp summery cocktails I've ever had.

My best friend and I wanted a good bar to hang out at in the city on a Saturday night that was walkable from the BART station and I did a little research. It's a couple blocks from Union Square and at night the area is a bit sketchy, but Rye is such a cool place that once you're inside, you'll forget about the homeless people outside. The ambiance is awesome...cool, dark, candle-lit and pretty. \n\nThe bartenders are really good at the mixology they do, and hopefully you perused through Yelp before going here because you won't find their signature drinks on the menu since they are just THAT well known for them! Get the Basil Gimlet FOR SURE. One of the best drinks I've ever had. Really. Ever. But it's also dangerous because it tastes so good that I can't taste the alcohol. It'll hit you before you know it. The Flash is also good, but we had ours without kiwi for the night because they ran out. I'd be curious how much better it would taste with the kiwi instead. Ours was just more cucumber-y. Which was still delicious. \n\nAsk them to make anything you want and I'm pretty sure they can do it. If you come early in the night, it's a great spot to chill and talk. We got there around 8:30 and left maybe an hour or so later so we probably avoided whatever crowds that might have come later at night and had a pretty good spot on a couch to talk as well as at the bar top counter. The space at the bar is very limited though, so I can imagine it would be hard to get your drinks later in the night. All in all, we had a chill experience and I'd come back.

Let me explain. If you're from the East Coast, especially the New York/New England/Pennsylvania area, you probably have some ancestral memory lodged deep in your mind about the virtues of rye whiskey. For those of us from the Northeast, Rye is our historical tipple of choice. Unfortunately, as a result of many years of marketing from the bourbon and vodka vendors, this perfect grain distillate had faded out of vogue.\r\n\r\nBut there is hope - in the late 1990s, Anchor Distillery launched a single malt rye whiskey - and since then a number of great rye whiskeys have come back onto the scene. So with this in mind, when I heard about Rye, I decided to make a trip out there.\r\n\r\nThe bar is beautiful, more East Coast than West - Scandinavian designed with wood accents everywhere. Down to every detail, the place screams \"The Bubble Is Back! Long Live The Internet Bubble!\"\r\n\r\nBut just on the promise that they may have rye, we went in.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was, well, horrible. Yuppie trash that decided to go out slumming in the Tendernob. Screeching bleached blonds and boisterous jock assholes vying for attention and hoping to get laid.\r\n\r\nBut they had rye, and we could get two seats at the corner of the bar near the door in case we needed to make a quick getaway.\r\n\r\nIt was at that point that I recalled what I thought about Paris: a beautiful city, if you could just get rid of the damned Parisians. Same thing goes for Rye.\r\n\r\nOur bartender, Jennifer, was the saving grace of the night. In between churning out 7&7s, Rum and (Diet) Cokes, 7 and Waters, Gin and Tonics, Stoli Vanillas and Ginger Ale and other drinks better suited for frat parties than a sophisticated bar like this, she served up some of the most amazing Manhattans (Jim Beam Rye, Noilly Prat Sweet (Red) Vermouth, Peychoud Bitters and a single sour cherry) - possibly the best I have ever had. She admitted that she had a soft spot for that cocktail, and she treated it with the respect that it deserved.\r\n\r\nWe went in planning on having one, or at the most two drinks total, as we didn't hit the ATM before heading in (yes, they are cash only for now). By the time we left, we had each had four - because I don't think either we or the bartenders wanted the night to end.\r\n\r\nAs we left, we mentioned to Jennifer that she was the saving grace for the bar because she made the crowd there \"tolerable\".\r\n\r\nSo, here is the breakdown:\r\n\r\nThe bar - The atmosphere, architecture and sense of style is great, and the inclusion of both an outside cage (where we saw a blond chickie climbing up and comically (to us) trying to sexily writhe for her man) for smokers and a pool table warrants a definite 5 out of 5. Hopefully next time we'll see someone smack into the wall-length mirror thinking there is another bar on the other side of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe bartenders - Everyone we had there was amazing, not only making great Manhattans, but muddling a pair of perfect Basil Gimlets (vodka) and a house drink called a Gold Rye Fizz - a rye drink with mandarin oranges, rye, bitters and a splash of cream as a substitute for the missing Advocaat/Eierlikor/Egg Liquor. Jennifer gets extra points for gracefully dropping a whole lemon in a martini glass full of Absolut Citron - the perfect \"lemon drop\" in my book. 5 out of 5\r\n\r\nThe selection - 5 out of 5 - this is a hard one. The beer was well selected, but I still winced when seeing someone order a can of Tecate (the crowd was mostly drinking Stella, but a good number of Chimays came out of the fridge). A number of good whiskeys were available with the well rye being Jim Beam Rye (yellow bottle). Some bimbettes wanted Crown Royal, which they were out of, or didn't carry... which thoroughly distressed them but amused us.\r\n\r\nThe crowd - 1 out of 5, and if I could give lower scores, I would.

Well, heads-up foodies, this is your bar.\r\n\r\n10 years ago, bars that served mojitos with fresh, muddled mint were rare delights. It can be had almost everywhere now.\r\n\r\nWell, Rye has one-upped everyone with a mise en place that probably confuses their supplier.\r\n\r\nMy first friend had a recipe that included muddled strawberries, rosemary simple syrup and egg whites. It was served to him, giggling, in a champagne flute. He was almost annoyed at first, until he tried it. He finished it fast, but not because he was embarrassed.\r\n\r\nI had a \"Thai me up\" with thai basil and peach puree. It was less tasty, but no less interesting - I ate too much of the chile pepper that was supplied as a garnish.\r\n\r\nI had another buddy order his standard, a \"plain-ole\" manhattan which he quickly declared one of the best he'd had.\r\n\r\nThe staff is amazingly friendly. With the wealth of knowledge they so easily display, it would be such an easy misstep into snobbery. No way. They'll explain each and every drink they make, but If you just want some whiskey on the rocks, it's served with a smile.\r\n\r\nI asked a different barkeep if the dark syrup he was using was made with turbinado sugar and he quietly spoke to me at length about how he liked the flavor but he found it muddied some other drinks.\r\n\r\nI wish I could remember everything he said, but all of a sudden, I was tipsy. It sneaks up on you at Rye. Everything tastes so good, there's no nausea to warn you of your impending liquor limit.\r\n\r\nAnother example of their uncomprising search for flavor - they won't stock popular drinks for popularity's sake. I heard one customer ask for a Corona - he was handed a can of Tecate instead with assurances it was better. I asked for a Red Stripe and was given a Sessions with the same guarantee. Risky? Not if you know what you're doing like Rye does.\r\n\r\nDon't go if: you just want to get your drink on at peak hours.
