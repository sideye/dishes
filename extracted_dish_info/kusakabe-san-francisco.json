Omakase stands for a meal consisting of dishes selected by the Chef. I highly recommend this because you get to taste a wide variety of fresh fish and flavors that you may not normally would order. You will likely try something that you have never tried before and be pleasantly surprised. \n\nOut of the three Omakases that I tried, Kusakabe, by far, was my favorite. (The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-31"}], "zuke chutoro": [{"excerpts": ["To start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) ", "helped prime the appetite.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing. Service was also helpful and professional, and all in all it was fantastic value given the price, quantity, and quality of what I got.

But i knew i wanted to order a few items a la carte, so i went with the 7 course menu.  When they seated us, they sat us at the bar! I love sitting at the bar because that's where you get to watch all the action.  My chef's name was Patrick and he was a great host and chef the whole evening.  The way this place works, is that you are supposed to use your hands to eat the sushi.  There will be some dishes that will require chopsticks.\n\nTo start off the night, we got the sake flight.  It's 3 different types of sake- Junmai, Ginjo, and Daiginjo.  The Junami sake we got was the Heart and soul- this was my 2nd favorite of the three.  The Ginjo sake was the Flying dragon- this was my least favorite.   The Daiginjo sake was the Sophisticated Mind- this was my favorite and by far the strongest among the three.  \n\nAnd now the begin the 7 course menu\n\nThe ichiban Dashi was like soup.  This soup had a very refreshing taste to it. \n\nSushi Prelude- Zuke Chutoro and halibut was fresh and sweet.  The smoked tuna was ok, but i'm biased, i never liked anything smoked\n\nSashimi-Also fresh and felt like it melted in your mouth\n\nHassan- 6 kinds of chef's assorted les petit.  This dish included a clam in a creamy corn sauce, which i loved.   The soft shell crab was really good.  The beef tartar was on a rice cracker which made it the perfect combo.  Jellyfish and the asparagus with shrimp was my least favorite because i normally don't like jellyfish and asparagus.  The oyster was sweet and super fresh.  There was no particular way to eat this, so i did it from least to favorite.  Save the best for last right?\n\nSoup- This fish soup was sweet and you can tell the spent time making this to get it to have this flavor, because i know that fish soup isn't easy to make.  A bonus to this soup is that it came with noodles. \n\nSeasonal Sushi- Yellowtail- really good,  Mackerel with egg yolk - this one was my favorite.  I love egg, so i loved how this was topped with egg yolk.  The first fish was a fish from a salmon family- this was ok, but it was really hard to top the Mackerel one! \n\nFinale- Scallop with Santa barbara Uni-  This one was tasty.  The scallop was so fresh along with the uni.  \n\nA la Carte-  Bafun Uni- This was like a party in your mouth.  Yes, it did give you the melt in your mouth taste and i wished i had more. I wanted more, but i was starting to get full\n\nWagyu-  This was good, but i think i liked the uni more. \n\nFor dessert I got the Cream Brulee- by far the best creme brulee i've ever had. It was perfect and not too sweet. \n\nYuzu sorbet-  this was very refreshing and perfect if you're a yuzu lover.  \n\nThe service was great and attentive.  They comp. my bday dessert which i didn't expect.  I will really want to come back again, but next time i'll try the 10 course menu and try all their uni selections!

They hold reservations for latecomers for 15 minutes. Our empty seats and place settings were waiting for us when we arrived. The dining area consists of a very long sushi bar and a couple of tables by the door.

The tables are also deliberately the same height, so even people who do not sit at the sushi bar can get a good view of the sushi chefs. So thoughtful.\n\nOur server asked us the usual 'Do you have any food allergies?' We replied 'No.' She also asked if we eat raw foods, and we confirmed we do. I'm sure that is part of their protocol to double-check everything, but it would be a pity if someone who does not like raw food made a reservation here and wasted a seat.\n\nYou can choose between the Omakase ($95) or the Grand Omakase ($195). They are very similar, but the Grand Omakase is more robust in volume. Both end with toro & A5 wagyu.  Everything was presented beautifully and seasoned excellently. There is no soy sauce or wasabi, so that's one less thing to think about. Most people eat the sushi with their hands, as is the traditional way, but they do provide chopsticks too.\n\nOf course I enjoyed the buttery toro (fatty tuna). The wagyu had beautiful marbling.

(The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-31"}, {"excerpts": ["The sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito.

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers. I thought it greatly added to the experience and having Chef Kusakabe serve us personally was a HUGE plus. In between dishes, we had the pleasure of watching him masterfully prep the sashimi.

Kusakabe uses soy sauce, teriyaki, and lemon to enhance the delicate flavors of fish, so no need to add it yourself.

By this dish, I was getting sick of the mushrooms, so I did not eat the mushroom portion. I'm also not a fan of sweet potato (satsuma-imo), but it was an interesting dish because of the combination. I wish it had an added crunch to contrast the soft foods. If you are brave, look up Shirako, which is in the dish.  \n7. Three kinds of sushi - All delicious!\n8.

After just returning from Tokyo and a few kaiseki-style dinners there, I am so grateful that San Francisco can boast hosting Kusakabe. \n\nYou will experience the respectful, careful, and loving attitude towards the ingredients here.

I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Zuke chutoro.

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.

It was probably my favorite omakase meal since my first experience at O Ya in Boston many years ago. \n\nKusakabe's omakase is served in the kaiseki style and, for the quality of the meal, is priced quite affordably at $95pp. There are a total of eleven courses, with an option to order additional items a la carte at the end of the meal. The entire experience was like a culinary symphony of thoughtfully orchestrated flavors, textures, and even temperatures - beautifully balanced and never in excess. Each bite of nigiri was delicate and nuanced in flavor. The thick slices of sashimi were fresh and melted in your mouth. There is also a very harmonious transition between the cold and warm dishes. Some of the courses that were particularly memorable included the zuke chutoro, the wagyu beef, and the hokkaido uni. \n\nI also loved the ambiance at Kusakabe. The space is intimate and inviting, with an understated elegance. Service was impeccable, on par with what you would expect at a high end Japanese establishment. The chef was warm and friendly.

Each one is a delicate work of handcrafted perfection, with a variety of subtle flavors that merit paused appreciation and wonder.  Then, as the omakase winds toward a grand finale of your choice (either bluefin toro or wagyu beef) a nigiri menu is brought forth and other individual delicacies become available for your selection.  These include thee different kinds of uni: an outstandingly smooth one from Santa Barbara (where more than half the world's uni originates), a deliciously delicate short-spine variety from Japan, and a third deep-sea variety which I reserved in eager anticipation for my next visit.\n\nChef Kusakabe stands behind the sushi bar personally crafting each piece with the assistance of five other chefs.

Compared to other omakases I've had, this is perhaps the most expensive, but I believe it's certainly worth it.\n\nEach prepared nigiri, represents to me the quintessential bite of sushi - the rice and fish are in perfect proportion, the rice had the perfect texture, each piece was seasoned well, and the fish is just so luxurious it basically melts in your mouth. The highlights for me were the Katsuo, Zuke Chutoro, and the Wagyu Beef pieces.\n\nThe other bites kind of left a little bit to be desired as they were sort of one note and not quite as lively or bright.

However, it was disappointing to find out\u00a0party of two or more were not able to sit by the sushi bar and we had 4 people. I feel like that is part of the experience if I was to dish out $200 bucks for a meal.\u00a0\n\nWe were seated promptly by our reservation time at 8:15 and we chose the Grand Omakase\u00a0because of the delicacy menu options (Truffle, A5 Wagyu beef, Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Eel from Tsukiji Market and Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly). An important thing to point out is we were NEVER served the Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly like the menu stated. Instead we were served Negitoro, which is minced fatty tuna with micro onion on a roasted seaweed. Those are two very different things, I wanted to ask why we were served the negitoro instead of the fatty tuna belly, but since my friends didn't mention I didn't want to be particular. Now that I think about it, I am quite angry that the manager didn't mention anything at all about switching our menu.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, a review on the food that we DID have. It was a 10 course menu (with 2 soups) and it was more than enough. A tip for everyone, if you want to do a la carte towards the end, I suggest you choose the regular Omakase with less courses. Actually with the Grand Omakase, there is a course with non-sashimi/sushi dish. So if you here for the sushi/sashimi definitely choose the regular Omakase then do a la carte at the end.\u00a0\n\nOne thing to note about the sushi here is that they seasoned all their rice. At first it looked like brown rice, then we realized every piece of rice has soy sauce seasoned so the flavor is even throughout. My favorite sushi\u00a0would definitely be the Oshinogi with Scallop+Uni sushi,\u00a0Nata with poached egg on spoon, the uni sushi and surprisingly the Shima Aji (stripe jack) which is the chef's choice of sushi. The Hassun which included 6 small plates was also very tasty, I love how the food is like art. The wagyu beef tartare was one of the most delicious tartare that I ever had.\u00a0The most disappointing course would definitely be the seared A5 Wagyu sushi, they over-seasoned it with too much pepper and salt overpowering the taste of the wagyu. It felt like they wasted a perfectly fine piece of meat, except the meat itself had a bit too much lines in it.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kusakabe for Omakase on a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. It seems like a popular date place, you can impress somebody\u00a0by bringing them here and eating in front of the sushi bar. It's a shame we didn't get to sit there to watch as the sushi chef prepare our dishes. There might have been 1 or 2 disappointment, nevertheless it was a good experience.

You go for the chef-led omakase and are presented with course after course of beautifully-formed, high-quality dishes that take your palate on a little tour of Japanese flavors and techniques. The dining room is small and reservations are required, but I got to come with a group of seven friends, and it was a great experience trying and discussing all the different courses together. This is not your typical, run-of-the-mill sushi, so be prepared to splurge (the base menu comes at a hefty $98/head), and come with an appreciation for the quality and cost of purveyance of the ingredients. \n\nCourse #1: a subtly-flavored dashi broth. Nothing unusual (after all, there are only three ingredients in this fish-based broth), but very clean tasting and a nice way to start the meal.\n\nCourse #2: The zuku chutoro (bluefin medium fatty tuna) was seared on one side, giving the fish a great texture to complement its flavors. The hirame halibut with its own liver had a slightly spicy kick, and the cold-smoked bonito (katsuo) resounded with the flavors of the wood smoke.\n\nCourse #3: Bluefin sashimi and poached amberjack (a surprising favorite of mine). These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle. But my favorite dish was definitely the soft-shell crab, which was so creamy on the inside and delicately crunchy on the inside!\n\nCourse 5: Red miso soup with a duck and lotus root meatball, layered with soy cream foam. Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience!

For a \"kaiseki\" styled sushi I was expecting much more creativity with the plating, flavor creativities, and texture creativities. Other than the Hassun (6 mini platere) I wouldn't call the rest \"kaiseki\". If kaiseki is the value customers are paying then Kusakabe needs more creativity on the flavors and efforts on the presentation. Sequencing is also important. Avoid soup / noodles in the middle of the menu; it is really filling after all the rice from sushi, difficult to enjoy the rest of the dishes if you get too full... The taste was good overall, thus the 4 stars. However, hamo/eel had a small bone that pierced through my gum when I bit into it. Restaurant waived my dessert as an apology.\n\nThere was a big turn off for me very early on... as soon as I got seated, there was a small fly flying around. Landed on my water cup, on the table, even the cutting board! (the chef turned around to work on other plates - it had since flown off, so he didn't see it landed there, so the next thing I know was pieces of sushi being placed on the same board where fly landed). \n\nMy chef was very friendly, 5 stars for him. I gave the staff overall 3 stars because I kept on having to dodge the server for water refills. Ideally, he could've waited until the water was at least half way down, or find a gap and ask if we'd like the water refilled. I almost hit his arm once or twice because I wasn't expecting an arm to come in between to refill the water when it was at a 60-70% level. Nice/friendly server, though lesser refills would be great. \n\nPrior to this, we had been to Wakuriya and sushi Kashiba, had really high expectations coming into Kusakabe, maybe bit too high on my end. My fiancee enjoyed it at Kusakabe quite a bit, mine was so so. For fine dining, experience matters. How much attention to detail matters, reaction of customer (case of frequent water refill) and environment (fly) really matter. Food can be good, chef and server can be friendly, it only takes a bit to ruin the 5 star experience. Perhaps my review may be on the harsher end, I definitely had very high expectations after all the good reviews. Customers want to make sure the cost is equals to the value expected. I hope Kusakabe continues to improve. Who knows, maybe I might just come in on a wrong day? Maybe I should give it one more try?\n\nThank you chefs, staff.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-09-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Eventually, after a few rounds of sushi and sashimi, they brought out the Hassun, which consisted of 6 tiny dishes, and was the most beautifully plated out of all the courses.

They were able to seat us promptly even though we were early.\nWe sat at the table right next to the door partition. It was a smallish place, so it was a bit tight for the servers to get past me. I felt bad since I didn't realize this until we left. They were all nice enough not to say anything! \n\nThey had two choices: the regular omakase (8 courses) or the grand omakase (11 courses). We opted for the regular $98 omakase menu. After we ordered, they gave us the dashi broth, along with warm towels and other eating utensils. We had more than one server bring us our food, and each one explained what they had placed on the table. I got too excited when they brought the sushi out so I didn't get to take pictures of the first sushi course. It was a piece of cured bluefin chutoro sushi that had a wonderful smoky flavor, paired with a piece of fresh fish served as is (not cured, marinated, etc.). You have one piece that was heavily flavored with soy sauce contrasting with another that was light and fresh, no frills. It was a very thoughtful pairing that not only didn't overwhelm my palate, but brought out the flavor of each piece of sushi. This theme continued throughout the meal with the sushi plates. \n\nEventually, after a few rounds of sushi and sashimi, they brought out the Hassun, which consisted of 6 tiny dishes, and was the most beautifully plated out of all the courses. I loved that you got a tiny bite of everything, rather than one entree. I won't go over everything, but wasn't blown away by the taste of the overall dish. I'm sure people who love clams would like the cold clam soup. I felt like it really brought out the flavor of the clams. I didn't particularly like it, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of clams. There was a lightly fried shrimp and taro, like shrimp and taro karage. Tasted like what you would expect. It also came with something that tasted like wagyu croquette, covered in crispy rice. It was quite small, so it was difficult to taste the wagyu. \n\nWe ended the meal with more fresh and melt-in-your-mouth sushi: a fun and delicious DIY hand roll served with scallop sushi topped with uni. They brought out an add-ons menu if we wanted to order anything a la carte. We were pretty satisfied, so we didn't add get anything else. After that, they came out with what I think was a yuzu sorbet, with a candle, on the house! I had forgot that they called ahead about a week before to ask if we were coming for any special reason. I had mentioned to them on the phone that it was my boyfriend's birthday. It was a nice surprise. The sorbet itself had a nice citrusy flavor, and came in a really cute little tea cup. \n\nIn general, I really liked the quality of the sushi and sashimi, along with the their flavors and the little additions and sauces served with them.

My friends and I were greeted by the host in the front and promptly led to our seats at the bar. The sushi chef in front of us introduced himself to us and asked us about our preferences for fish. We went with the regular omakase over the grand one. The whole experience itself was fun. You got to watch the chef make all the nigiri in front of you. Fresh from their hands straight onto your plate. Our chef was super friendly and let us try to guess which fish was coming next. \n\nMy favorite item of the night was the sashimi of tuna and scallops that came beautifully arranged atop a bowl of ice. The scallops were amazingly sweet and the tuna just melted in your mouth. This item earned 5/5 stars for me and I wish I could have eaten it all night long. Other honorable mentions were the hamachi+mackerel (forgot what the name of the fish was) and the cherrywood smoked tuna. Both were very unique in flavor and the fish was super fresh and supple. \n\nWhat disappointed me the most were the hassun, the toro, and the wagyu beef. The hassun was gorgeously presented, but of all the items on the dish, not a single one stood out to me. The toro was chewy and nothing near the melt in the mouth quality I was hoping for. Same went for the wagyu beef. It was so chewy that I ended up swallowing the beef whole. For $15 extra a piece, I was quite bitter about ordering it after eating it. \n\nFor $100 for an omakase, I would most likely not be coming back here anytime soon. The quality of the fish was decent, but the items themselves were nothing to rave over. I will say that if you want to come here, ask for a reservation at the bar. It is well worth it.

I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish. Spoiler alert: You will likely feel compelled to continue after your omakase is done, there is just so much good stuff to try!\n\nHere's an overview of our meal. Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best.

The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers.

Each dish was well-thought out and went beyond just the typical nigiri. Before our meal our sushi chef asked us if there was anything we didn't like or really liked. I really dislike wasabi and usually for omakase they add it to every piece of sushi. However our chef made sure to only put a small amount for all my pieces and I couldn't even taste it!\n\nI believe the menu changes seasonally, but here's what we had:\n- Ichiban Dashi - first up was soup, like a fancier version of miso soup, probably the best soup I've had using dashi broth!\n- Sushi prelude - next we were served 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, one was the king of all sushi - the toro tuna! So soft and buttery, each and every piece. The other 4 pieces were seasonal and the chef makes sure to tell you where each fish comes from :) I believe we had scallop from Santa Barbara!\n- Sashimi - next we were given four different types of sashimi paired with 4 different unique types of sauce/toppings.

Kusakabe uses soy sauce, teriyaki, and lemon to enhance the delicate flavors of fish, so no need to add it yourself.

Sushi Prelude: \n     Zuke Chutoro - Bluefin tuna cured in soy sauce sauce and seared with a blowtorch.\n     Two seasonal sushi - My favorite was the halibut, which was cut thin enough to see through. My boyfriend loved the tuna with lemon.\n3. Sashimi - Perfect dish! The tuber slice was a nice added crunch. \n4. Umami Soup - Personally, though there was too much mushroom for my taste, but overall good, delicate dish. Quintessential umami flavor. Not sure if I liked the rice and lotus root dumpling, but I'm glad I tried it. \n5. Hassun (Le Petite Plats) - I did not enjoy the mushroom or egg plats, but the others were wonderful. My favorite was the warm truffle croquette and caviar oyster.\n6. Warm Dish - The flavor was too subtle. It needed a kick like an added spice. By this dish, I was getting sick of the mushrooms, so I did not eat the mushroom portion. I'm also not a fan of sweet potato (satsuma-imo), but it was an interesting dish because of the combination. I wish it had an added crunch to contrast the soft foods. If you are brave, look up Shirako, which is in the dish.  \n7. Three kinds of sushi - All delicious!\n8. Sushi finale (Your Choice) - I chose A5 Grade wagyu beef, lightly seared. My favorite sushi of the entire meal! A wonderful finale. \n\nFor my birthday, Kusakabe also gave me a complimentary dessert, Chestnut ice cream - a unique dessert, but not something I would crave. They also sang \"Happy Birthday,\" which was absolutely adorable. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience! I would definitely recommend Kusakabe to any foodie or sushi lover who is willing to spend big bucks.

Sashimi: the maguro and barracuda were meant to be dipped with either house grated onion with yuzu, chive, and salt or traditional soy sauce + wasabi\n  - Thinly sliced salmon wrapped around cucumber with a bamboo charcoal miso: the miso was very unique \n  - Red snapper: wrapped with ankimo, topped with Italian summer truffle and sitting on a ponzu truffle gelee.

It's actually a flavored take on tamago (egg) sushi where the lobster flavor is infused with the egg.  Enjoyed this as it was an interested take, but just don't get caught up on trying to find the lobster.\nThere were also three desserts on the menu (one being panna cotta), but nothing was attractive to my guest so we passed.\nAs many described, this is authentic Japanese cuisine served in a fine dining atmosphere without the stuffy dress code.

I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish. Spoiler alert: You will likely feel compelled to continue after your omakase is done, there is just so much good stuff to try!\n\nHere's an overview of our meal. Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best. Dammit. Next time.\n\nAll in all it was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go again!

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers. I thought it greatly added to the experience and having Chef Kusakabe serve us personally was a HUGE plus. In between dishes, we had the pleasure of watching him masterfully prep the sashimi.

My lovely BF surprised me with reservations here for our anniversary and oh my god it was such a beautiful and creative dining experience.\n\nReservations become available online 2 months in advance and for the true omakase experience you gotta sit at the sushi bar so you can watch your chef can personalize each part of the meal to your liking :) \n\nThey only serve omakase, a $150 grand set or the $95 set, with options for add-ons at the end of the meal. Feeling fancy, we opted for the grand set and if you're looking for a time to splurge, this would be it!\n\nThe omakase experience is unique to each restaurant but the creativity and care that goes into each piece is where Kusakabe really shines. Each dish was well-thought out and went beyond just the typical nigiri. Before our meal our sushi chef asked us if there was anything we didn't like or really liked. I really dislike wasabi and usually for omakase they add it to every piece of sushi. However our chef made sure to only put a small amount for all my pieces and I couldn't even taste it!\n\nI believe the menu changes seasonally, but here's what we had:\n- Ichiban Dashi - first up was soup, like a fancier version of miso soup, probably the best soup I've had using dashi broth!\n- Sushi prelude - next we were served 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, one was the king of all sushi - the toro tuna! So soft and buttery, each and every piece. The other 4 pieces were seasonal and the chef makes sure to tell you where each fish comes from :) I believe we had scallop from Santa Barbara!\n- Sashimi - next we were given four different types of sashimi paired with 4 different unique types of sauce/toppings. One included truffle shavings and another was mussels. The flavor combos were so good, although some I liked more than others but definitely all flavors I had never tried before.\n- Hassun - the creativity continues with a box of a random assortment of seafood in all shapes and forms. But presentation on point for errything. Honestly some weren't that tasty (there was a weird seafood cracker that I didn't like) but again, just so unique and such detailed preparation.\n- Soup - this was a creamy cauliflower soup with abalone and abalone mushrooms. Tasted like a lighter version of clam chowder but seriously soo delicious!\n- Sushi Chic - more nigiri sushi including uni (sea urchin) from Santa Barbara! I'm not a big uni fan but oh boy this one was so buttery and creamy and slightly sweet. Definitely can taste the quality and freshness!\n- Sushi Finale - ended with Unagi (BBQ eel) and a choice of toro or wagyu beef. I'd recommend the wagyu beef since it is so tender and they sear it right in front of you with a touch of pepper. It just melted in my mouth like butter.

It apparently took my boyfriend's boss 6 months to get a call-in reservation. My boyfriend used the app \"Reserve\" and secured a reservation a month in advance. The app also pays the bill automatically once you are at the restaurant. \n\nKusakabe was my first Omasake and Michelin star experience. They offer a $95 prefixe menu and automatically add tip to the bill. If you are still hungry after the prefixe (which is a lot, trust me), they have an optional nigiri selection for added costs, including octopus and sea urchin.\n\nThe sushi is incredibly flavorful and they hand-grate their own fresh ginger and wasabi (sweeter and more delicate than ready-made wasabi). Kusakabe uses soy sauce, teriyaki, and lemon to enhance the delicate flavors of fish, so no need to add it yourself. The mushroom dishes were inventive and interesting, but too many for my liking (even though I love mushrooms). You are free to make specific requests in case you don't like a particular food like mushroom or egg, but do this in the beginning; they will ask you.\n\n1/12/15 Prefixe Menu Critique:\n1. Ichiban Dashi - Great broth to get the belly ready for the feast ahead.\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n     Zuke Chutoro - Bluefin tuna cured in soy sauce sauce and seared with a blowtorch.\n     Two seasonal sushi - My favorite was the halibut, which was cut thin enough to see through. My boyfriend loved the tuna with lemon.\n3. Sashimi - Perfect dish! The tuber slice was a nice added crunch. \n4. Umami Soup - Personally, though there was too much mushroom for my taste, but overall good, delicate dish. Quintessential umami flavor. Not sure if I liked the rice and lotus root dumpling, but I'm glad I tried it. \n5. Hassun (Le Petite Plats) - I did not enjoy the mushroom or egg plats, but the others were wonderful. My favorite was the warm truffle croquette and caviar oyster.\n6. Warm Dish - The flavor was too subtle. It needed a kick like an added spice. By this dish, I was getting sick of the mushrooms, so I did not eat the mushroom portion. I'm also not a fan of sweet potato (satsuma-imo), but it was an interesting dish because of the combination. I wish it had an added crunch to contrast the soft foods. If you are brave, look up Shirako, which is in the dish.  \n7. Three kinds of sushi - All delicious!\n8. Sushi finale (Your Choice) - I chose A5 Grade wagyu beef, lightly seared. My favorite sushi of the entire meal! A wonderful finale. \n\nFor my birthday, Kusakabe also gave me a complimentary dessert, Chestnut ice cream - a unique dessert, but not something I would crave. They also sang \"Happy Birthday,\" which was absolutely adorable. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience! I would definitely recommend Kusakabe to any foodie or sushi lover who is willing to spend big bucks.

Being from Boston, we also happen to be seated next to someone from Quincy. Small world.\n\n[Service]: Your dinner experience is impacted depending on where you sit for sushi. I prefer to be seated at the sushi bar, and this time was no different. You are able to mingle with the chef if you like, and get his opinion on what is best that day. Being able to be served by the chef as soon as it is ready is a much better experience than being seated at a table and waiting for a server to bring your food. With that said, the food came out fast.\n\n[Food]: I would like to begin this section and mention the konbu cha (kelp tea) was surprisingly good--I had to hunt some down for myself. Onto the food: Kaiseki style omakase. Konbu cha followed by delicious chutoro, great way to start. At the bar, we're asked what kind of sushi we like, and were tailored to that for the sushi chic (might be different for dining room table). Finally, you have a blue pill or red pill kind of choice for either toro or wagyu. At the time when I went, there were two soup bowls that were between servings of nigri or small plates. Not only for cleansing the pallet, but this kind of progression gives it a sense of peaks and valleys (tea, solid, solid, soup, solid, solid, soup, etc). What holds this back though is probably the rice vinegar. The nigri was good, but it didn't have a wow factor.\n\n[Decor]: The sushi bar is near the entrance. I am not sure if there is a dining room area in the back, so I am unable to comment on it. It is clean and simple. The lights are more focused on the table and not directly above where you sit. Exposed brick wall and what appears to be a single cut of wood for what is the sushi bar table. I would have liked the seats to be a little higher.\n\n[Atmosphere]: You won't need to shout here to be heard. There are much more intimate places you can take someone to, Kusakabe is more for social event. Being in downtown, there were some business types as well.

Everything was plated nicely which made it that much more appetizing too. What I really appreciated was Chef Nori's knife skills. He does all the cutting of the sashimi, and there would be assistants on each side of him that makes the nigiri rice. We got suuuuper lucky though, because we sat in the middle right in front of the chef, so not only did we get to admire his skills, but we were also served PERSONALLY by him! Dream come true for a sushi fanatic like myself. My only regret was the sushi finale, we expected it to go out with a *BANG* but it was more of a silent *bang*, the A5 wagyu and toro was slightly chewy. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the king salmon, zuke, and uni. Those were all items that I got multiples of on a-la-carte (minus the uni, that's not part of the omakase...go figure). I also enjoyed their corn miso ice cream. MUST GET to finish off your meal! Service was mediocre considering we spent close to $400, but five stars still goes to Kusakabe for delivering high quality sushi and an unforgettable experience to us.\n\nBest meal of my life...EVER.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-10-07"}, {"excerpts": ["ON the day we went our menu consisted of the \"tea\", sushi prelude involving a few pieces of nigiri, a sashimi selection, miso soup, unique sushi, sushi plate, sushi chic, tomato tomato tomato (not a typo), and sushi finale.

There are plenty of sushi joints in SF and many claim to be legit but this place truly explores kaiseki principles in their refined omakase menu. This place keeps the options simple and offers all guests a $95 omakase menu with the option to add a la carte items. The restaurant itself is located right next to the Transamerica building and the d\u00e9cor is simple with multiple seats at the sushi bar with around 6-8 additional tables throughout the dining area. Although I was unable to sit at the sushi bar, I highly recommend folks do this. Even from my seat, it was quite a delight to watch the sushi chefs at work. We were seated immediately and servers came over to take our drink order. There is a good selection of Sake here so I am already a fan.\n\nThis joint is the true omakase as the chefs determine what they will prepare daily depending on the availability of product and the season for certain types of fishes. One thing I want to warn yelpers is that this is a true dining experience and not purely just a sushi joint. If you are coming here to just eat sushi, you have the opportunity to order the a la carte but don't write off the rest of the menu.

The toro was nothing like I had ever seen/tasted and just absolute melt in your mouth. \n\nThis entire experience was top notch and I appreciated the simplistic approach to fine cuisine.

I have few other meals to use for comparison, but Kusakabe's simplistic omakase offering leaves your experience entirely up to the chef, who has crafted the menu based on seasonality and quality of ingredients. Each guest must first complete the $95 omakase menu, and then there is the choice to order more dishes a la carte. My boyfriend and I came for his birthday dinner and were seated at the sushi bar for the full experience. \n\nThe first course was a kelp tea, which reminded me of a light seaweed soup. The light umami flavors were the perfect way to cleanse your palate for the meal to come. The next course was a sushi prelude, which included four different cuts of nigiri based on both the chef's choice and your personal preferences. Each piece is served individually, with both wasabi and soy sauce painted and melded into the nigiri for a complete bite. My favorite of the prelude was the seared fatty tuna, which had the delicious charcoal flavor of the sear paired with the rich buttery flavor of the fish. The next course was sashimi in ice, which featured fresh raw scallops and tuna. The presentation was beautiful, and I was extremely surprised at how fresh the scallop was. The soup course was next, which was an umami broth with a crab and tofu cake. I could drink bowls and bowls of this soup- the flavor was amazing and the fresh pieces of crab added a nice brininess to the bowl. The hassan course followed, and this was by far my favorite. The long platter featured five small bites- cucumber and ice fish, tomago and unagi, fresh oyster, tuna nigiri, and then a crispy soft shell crab fried with rice crackers on the outside. The crab was the best, with the rice cracker breading adding an extra element of flavor to the typical fried crunch. Next, the hot course was a miso glazed halibut on top of a garbanzo bean puree. This dish was somehow the heartiest of the night, despite the fact that the halibut was extremely delicate and flakey. The sushi finale then follows, with another three pieces of nigiri. My favorite here was the cherry salmon, a particularly fragrant and bright salmon with a slightly sweet flavor. For the final course, you're given a choice of the wagyu beef or otoro. I went with the otoro, which was the perfect last bite and testament to the quality of the ingredients and food that Kusakabe puts out. \n\nMy boyfriend was given a free birthday dessert, which was a shiso sorbet. The clean flavors of the shiso left our palates light at the end of the meal, and I couldn't have asked for a better dessert.

After a somewhat disasterous dinner at Pabu the night before, our fingers were crossed as we head to Kusakabe.\n\nWe had the earliest reservation at 5 pm and we were the only ones there.  So, we had Nori-san's full attention for about 30 minutes until others starting to arrive.  I didn't really care about the kelp tea as many others did.  Just by looking at the rice, I already know it's not the kind I like.  I think it's the type of rice he uses.  Maybe we were there too early, the rice was still a bit warm when served.  I feel the sushi had too many accoutrements on them.  A dash of this and a sprinkle of that.  Some were overpowering the taste of the fish.  The duck dumpling miso soup was good.  But, the bowl was really shallow and you can't tell by looking at it.  I did not like the crispy rice cracker tofu.  It was oily.  And, once you pour the konbu dashi broth over, it made it soggy as well.  For the sushi finale, you get to pick between toro or grade A5 wagyu.  We wanted them both so it's an add-on.  We also each added the $14 a piece kaisui uni.  The uni was divine!  The ingredients they use are definitely top notch.  But, you get what you pay for, right!?  Not sure why the dessert is not included with the omakase.  Anyway, dessert is not their forte.  The top of their maccha creme brulee was not even caramelized hard enough like it should be.

Omakase stands for a meal consisting of dishes selected by the Chef. I highly recommend this because you get to taste a wide variety of fresh fish and flavors that you may not normally would order. You will likely try something that you have never tried before and be pleasantly surprised. \n\nOut of the three Omakases that I tried, Kusakabe, by far, was my favorite. (The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-31"}, {"excerpts": ["We were watching the chefs prepare the chi ayu (basically long thin fish) for frying and they were dusting every fin and tail and then painting their bodies with flour in preparation for frying.

I can still taste the intense smokey flavor of the katsuo that gave way to the rich flavor of the fish.  It was delicious.  The Chef explained only the outside of the fish is smoked so the interior keeps its natural flavor. \n\nA sashimi bowl followed miso soup and a beautiful plate of 5 small bites.  First was a tomato with tomato ice which was intensely tomato flavored, then Kona crab, a perfect Higoku oyster with a bit of caviar, blue fin negi toro and bite of shrimp.\n\nAfter B.B.Q. Unagi and matsutate croquette and 3 more perfect nigiri the sushi finale of toro or grade 5 Miyazaki wagyu beef was eaten with delight. We always do both!  LOL\n\nFrom the after omakase menu though quite full, we decided to try the gyoku, a fresh lobster omelet; another smoked katsuo.\n\nAnd then an off menu fresh not frozen unagi seared with a crispy skin.  It was just delicious. \n\nUnder the guidance of Hiromi, we splurged on some special sake, Dassai \"Centrifuge\" Migaki23 Junmai Daiginjo which we loved a bit too much. \n\nDessert of a light yuzu sorbet and a chestnut creme brulee were just a small sweet bite after such a full dinner.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing.

But i knew i wanted to order a few items a la carte, so i went with the 7 course menu.  When they seated us, they sat us at the bar! I love sitting at the bar because that's where you get to watch all the action.  My chef's name was Patrick and he was a great host and chef the whole evening.  The way this place works, is that you are supposed to use your hands to eat the sushi.  There will be some dishes that will require chopsticks.\n\nTo start off the night, we got the sake flight.  It's 3 different types of sake- Junmai, Ginjo, and Daiginjo.  The Junami sake we got was the Heart and soul- this was my 2nd favorite of the three.  The Ginjo sake was the Flying dragon- this was my least favorite.   The Daiginjo sake was the Sophisticated Mind- this was my favorite and by far the strongest among the three.  \n\nAnd now the begin the 7 course menu\n\nThe ichiban Dashi was like soup.  This soup had a very refreshing taste to it. \n\nSushi Prelude- Zuke Chutoro and halibut was fresh and sweet.  The smoked tuna was ok, but i'm biased, i never liked anything smoked\n\nSashimi-Also fresh and felt like it melted in your mouth\n\nHassan- 6 kinds of chef's assorted les petit.  This dish included a clam in a creamy corn sauce, which i loved.   The soft shell crab was really good.  The beef tartar was on a rice cracker which made it the perfect combo.  Jellyfish and the asparagus with shrimp was my least favorite because i normally don't like jellyfish and asparagus.  The oyster was sweet and super fresh.  There was no particular way to eat this, so i did it from least to favorite.  Save the best for last right?\n\nSoup- This fish soup was sweet and you can tell the spent time making this to get it to have this flavor, because i know that fish soup isn't easy to make.  A bonus to this soup is that it came with noodles. \n\nSeasonal Sushi- Yellowtail- really good,  Mackerel with egg yolk - this one was my favorite.  I love egg, so i loved how this was topped with egg yolk.  The first fish was a fish from a salmon family- this was ok, but it was really hard to top the Mackerel one! \n\nFinale- Scallop with Santa barbara Uni-  This one was tasty.  The scallop was so fresh along with the uni.  \n\nA la Carte-  Bafun Uni- This was like a party in your mouth.  Yes, it did give you the melt in your mouth taste and i wished i had more. I wanted more, but i was starting to get full\n\nWagyu-  This was good, but i think i liked the uni more. \n\nFor dessert I got the Cream Brulee- by far the best creme brulee i've ever had. It was perfect and not too sweet. \n\nYuzu sorbet-  this was very refreshing and perfect if you're a yuzu lover.  \n\nThe service was great and attentive.  They comp. my bday dessert which i didn't expect.  I will really want to come back again, but next time i'll try the 10 course menu and try all their uni selections!

Doors don't open until exactly 5:00PM. Through the curtains is a narrow hall and doorway. Upon entering, the host will ask for your reservation and you will be seated in your designated spots.

We opted for the $95 and some sake, of course. They started us off with some dashi broth, which was really nice on a cold, rainy evening. Then came the sushi. While there are chopsticks provided, we used our fingers for the most part. There's a bit of cloth for you to wipe your fingers on between pieces and some food items are much easier to handle with chopsticks, so there's no pressure. Each piece of sushi was so special and the taste so unique. The Zuke Toro was the most unforgettable one, so much that later on, we ordered another round a la carte.

They hold reservations for latecomers for 15 minutes. Our empty seats and place settings were waiting for us when we arrived. The dining area consists of a very long sushi bar and a couple of tables by the door. Our sushi chef explained that the restaurant design deliberately omitted the glass fish case so the patrons can easily see the chefs prepare food. The tables are also deliberately the same height, so even people who do not sit at the sushi bar can get a good view of the sushi chefs. So thoughtful.\n\nOur server asked us the usual 'Do you have any food allergies?' We replied 'No.' She also asked if we eat raw foods, and we confirmed we do. I'm sure that is part of their protocol to double-check everything, but it would be a pity if someone who does not like raw food made a reservation here and wasted a seat.\n\nYou can choose between the Omakase ($95) or the Grand Omakase ($195). They are very similar, but the Grand Omakase is more robust in volume. Both end with toro & A5 wagyu.  Everything was presented beautifully and seasoned excellently. There is no soy sauce or wasabi, so that's one less thing to think about. Most people eat the sushi with their hands, as is the traditional way, but they do provide chopsticks too.\n\nOf course I enjoyed the buttery toro (fatty tuna). The wagyu had beautiful marbling. The zuke chutoro (medium fatty tuna) was also excellent with a light sear on top. All the accompanying flavoring agents were excellent. I especially enjoyed the yuzu onion sauce.

Omakase stands for a meal consisting of dishes selected by the Chef. I highly recommend this because you get to taste a wide variety of fresh fish and flavors that you may not normally would order. You will likely try something that you have never tried before and be pleasantly surprised. \n\nOut of the three Omakases that I tried, Kusakabe, by far, was my favorite. (The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-31"}, {"excerpts": ["The sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito.

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers. I thought it greatly added to the experience and having Chef Kusakabe serve us personally was a HUGE plus. In between dishes, we had the pleasure of watching him masterfully prep the sashimi.

My boyfriend used the app \"Reserve\" and secured a reservation a month in advance. The app also pays the bill automatically once you are at the restaurant. \n\nKusakabe was my first Omasake and Michelin star experience. They offer a $95 prefixe menu and automatically add tip to the bill. If you are still hungry after the prefixe (which is a lot, trust me), they have an optional nigiri selection for added costs, including octopus and sea urchin.\n\nThe sushi is incredibly flavorful and they hand-grate their own fresh ginger and wasabi (sweeter and more delicate than ready-made wasabi). Kusakabe uses soy sauce, teriyaki, and lemon to enhance the delicate flavors of fish, so no need to add it yourself. The mushroom dishes were inventive and interesting, but too many for my liking (even though I love mushrooms). You are free to make specific requests in case you don't like a particular food like mushroom or egg, but do this in the beginning; they will ask you.\n\n1/12/15 Prefixe Menu Critique:\n1.

Not sure if I liked the rice and lotus root dumpling, but I'm glad I tried it. \n5. Hassun (Le Petite Plats) - I did not enjoy the mushroom or egg plats, but the others were wonderful. My favorite was the warm truffle croquette and caviar oyster.\n6. Warm Dish - The flavor was too subtle. It needed a kick like an added spice. By this dish, I was getting sick of the mushrooms, so I did not eat the mushroom portion. I'm also not a fan of sweet potato (satsuma-imo), but it was an interesting dish because of the combination. I wish it had an added crunch to contrast the soft foods. If you are brave, look up Shirako, which is in the dish.  \n7. Three kinds of sushi - All delicious!\n8. Sushi finale (Your Choice) - I chose A5 Grade wagyu beef, lightly seared. My favorite sushi of the entire meal! A wonderful finale. \n\nFor my birthday, Kusakabe also gave me a complimentary dessert, Chestnut ice cream - a unique dessert, but not something I would crave. They also sang \"Happy Birthday,\" which was absolutely adorable. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience!

Kusakabe is my absolute favorite  fine-dining experience I have had so far! It was my first experience of the Japanese fine-dining and gave me my first touch with kaiseki as well.\n\nKaiseki is an artful method of preparing and serving food -- the entire meal is a balance of taste, texture, appearance and colors. So of course presentation is of huge importance, and every dish you receive is poetically beautiful. After just returning from Tokyo and a few kaiseki-style dinners there, I am so grateful that San Francisco can boast hosting Kusakabe. \n\nYou will experience the respectful, careful, and loving attitude towards the ingredients here. You will definitely notice the superbness of all the ingredients that are used, from the soy sauce to the toro. ALL of the dishes made me feel happy, every piece was a beautiful mix of flavors.

I found this very special since most of the unagi you will eat in your life is pre-packaged and frozen. The chefs at Kusakabe buy their own eel and prepare it themselves.

I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Zuke (so good "], "author": "Jessica P.", "review": "Kusakabe must be on a bad streak.

The hokkaido scallop in the \"zukuri\" (a.k.a. sashimi) course had this sweetness that you don't get out of usual scallops. The bite-sized croquette had a nice crunchy texture on the outside. The most interesting non-sushi dish for me was the chawanmushi (egg custard) -- it had a little bit of ume (sour plum) hidden away in the center, for a really surprising (in a good way) contrast of flavor.

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.  And the fish were pretty basic/limited I thought. I think for similar rate, you can get better quality fish at Akiko's.\n\nI like a lot of variety since I eat a lot.

(You can order additional pieces later on in the dinner, but  pure a la carte is not an option). Compared to other omakases I've had, this is perhaps the most expensive, but I believe it's certainly worth it.\n\nEach prepared nigiri, represents to me the quintessential bite of sushi - the rice and fish are in perfect proportion, the rice had the perfect texture, each piece was seasoned well, and the fish is just so luxurious it basically melts in your mouth. The highlights for me were the Katsuo, Zuke Chutoro, and the Wagyu Beef pieces.\n\nThe other bites kind of left a little bit to be desired as they were sort of one note and not quite as lively or bright. The standout, though, was the raw octopus with persimmon which was a really tasty dish with the contrasting textures of persimmon and octopus pairing quite nicely with the sweetness of both complimenting each other very well. \n\nHowever, I have to deduct a star based on their inability to accommodate our reservation. As a Michelin Star establishment, they should be able to keep the reservation at the scheduled time. We were not able to get seated for over 45 minutes after our scheduled reservation, and even that took a little bit more prodding by the girlfriend to get done (Even though I'm the lawyer in the relationship, she's better at negotiating tough situations).\n\nWe were given 10% off our bill at the end of the day, which isn't insignificant given the cost of admission, but I would've still appreciated a timely reservation more.\n\nI hope to try this place again and hopefully a future reservation will be held up to the scheduled time.\n\nAlmost a perfect experience.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-18"}, {"excerpts": ["First 3 pieces of nigiri: chef choice: bonito, seared zuke chutoro cured in soy, halibut with marinated kelp and umami.

Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef.

I've tried numerous Michelin Star Sushi places in the city and the best Sushi spots in So Cal and this is by far my favorite.  Yes, it's better than even the sushi at the Tokyo fish market (albeit more expensive; but so is a flight to Japan).\n\nKusakabe blends traditional and modern perfectly. It provides multiple complex flavors with each bite. It's made to please everyone and it's quite different than Omakase's edomae style, for example. It's very San Francisco's and it incorporates things like avocado. That being said it still keeps the tradition of sushi and respectfully modernizes it and elevates the flavor profiles. Nothing quite like it.\n\nMake sure to ask to be seated at the bar so you can converse with your chef and make it a personal experience (bonus points: ask for the main Chef, Mitsunori). Ask them about why they are there and how hard they had to work to get where they are. Trust me, it will change your perspective on sushi and you'll find a new appreciation for the art (oh and if you don't know proper etiquette, they'll teach you that, too).

You can have more complex conversations about the specific sushi, techniques, ask for the Wagyu Beef's certificate, etc. \n\nI've done table seating, too, and it's a completely different experience.

However, it was disappointing to find out\u00a0party of two or more were not able to sit by the sushi bar and we had 4 people. I feel like that is part of the experience if I was to dish out $200 bucks for a meal.\u00a0\n\nWe were seated promptly by our reservation time at 8:15 and we chose the Grand Omakase\u00a0because of the delicacy menu options (Truffle, A5 Wagyu beef, Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Eel from Tsukiji Market and Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly). An important thing to point out is we were NEVER served the Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly like the menu stated. Instead we were served Negitoro, which is minced fatty tuna with micro onion on a roasted seaweed. Those are two very different things, I wanted to ask why we were served the negitoro instead of the fatty tuna belly, but since my friends didn't mention I didn't want to be particular. Now that I think about it, I am quite angry that the manager didn't mention anything at all about switching our menu.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, a review on the food that we DID have. It was a 10 course menu (with 2 soups) and it was more than enough. A tip for everyone, if you want to do a la carte towards the end, I suggest you choose the regular Omakase with less courses. Actually with the Grand Omakase, there is a course with non-sashimi/sushi dish. So if you here for the sushi/sashimi definitely choose the regular Omakase then do a la carte at the end.\u00a0\n\nOne thing to note about the sushi here is that they seasoned all their rice. At first it looked like brown rice, then we realized every piece of rice has soy sauce seasoned so the flavor is even throughout. My favorite sushi\u00a0would definitely be the Oshinogi with Scallop+Uni sushi,\u00a0Nata with poached egg on spoon, the uni sushi and surprisingly the Shima Aji (stripe jack) which is the chef's choice of sushi. The Hassun which included 6 small plates was also very tasty, I love how the food is like art. The wagyu beef tartare was one of the most delicious tartare that I ever had.\u00a0The most disappointing course would definitely be the seared A5 Wagyu sushi, they over-seasoned it with too much pepper and salt overpowering the taste of the wagyu. It felt like they wasted a perfectly fine piece of meat, except the meat itself had a bit too much lines in it.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kusakabe for Omakase on a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. It seems like a popular date place, you can impress somebody\u00a0by bringing them here and eating in front of the sushi bar. It's a shame we didn't get to sit there to watch as the sushi chef prepare our dishes. There might have been 1 or 2 disappointment, nevertheless it was a good experience.

You go for the chef-led omakase and are presented with course after course of beautifully-formed, high-quality dishes that take your palate on a little tour of Japanese flavors and techniques. The dining room is small and reservations are required, but I got to come with a group of seven friends, and it was a great experience trying and discussing all the different courses together. This is not your typical, run-of-the-mill sushi, so be prepared to splurge (the base menu comes at a hefty $98/head), and come with an appreciation for the quality and cost of purveyance of the ingredients. \n\nCourse #1: a subtly-flavored dashi broth. Nothing unusual (after all, there are only three ingredients in this fish-based broth), but very clean tasting and a nice way to start the meal.\n\nCourse #2: The zuku chutoro (bluefin medium fatty tuna) was seared on one side, giving the fish a great texture to complement its flavors. The hirame halibut with its own liver had a slightly spicy kick, and the cold-smoked bonito (katsuo) resounded with the flavors of the wood smoke.\n\nCourse #3: Bluefin sashimi and poached amberjack (a surprising favorite of mine). These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle. But my favorite dish was definitely the soft-shell crab, which was so creamy on the inside and delicately crunchy on the inside!\n\nCourse 5: Red miso soup with a duck and lotus root meatball, layered with soy cream foam. Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience!

Lily T. & I opted in for the $150 grand omakase which included 25 items. Each piece of nigiri was a die for. Perfectly seasoned, no soy sauce required, and also added with some citrus and wasabi depending on the nigiri. I love for a fact the Chef also asks you if you're allergic to anything and if you had any favorite fish so they can do a little remix. \n\nMetered street parking was easily found before 6 pm.

Hearing very positive reviews about their A5 Miyazaki Wagyu nigiri and after tasting fantastic Kobe beef in Japan, definitely knew I had to try a piece. My expectations were high and the Wagyu nigiri blew past them with ease. The beef was super marbley and tender, and the umami and fatty juices just burst in my mouth with every bite. This is definitely my recommended must-try, extremely worth the $14 for the piece.\n \nAfterwards, we ordered a couple desserts to share. We started with the yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet, which was very refreshing and tangy. Next we had their kome koji (ingredient used to make sake) ice cream, which was very unique, although unsweetened. Finally, we tried their daiginjo sake kasu creme brulee - also great, very rich and sweet creme brulee with a bit of sake kick. Very great to share with a group.\n \nThe bill came out to be about $115 per person pre-tax/tips.

Apparently the venue is not large enough for strollers and high chairs, but we all know that a crying infant or hyperactive toddler could ruin any dining experience. \n\nMr. Joy and I were a few minutes late for our reservation, but they were very nice about it. They hold reservations for latecomers for 15 minutes. Our empty seats and place settings were waiting for us when we arrived. The dining area consists of a very long sushi bar and a couple of tables by the door. Our sushi chef explained that the restaurant design deliberately omitted the glass fish case so the patrons can easily see the chefs prepare food. The tables are also deliberately the same height, so even people who do not sit at the sushi bar can get a good view of the sushi chefs. So thoughtful.\n\nOur server asked us the usual 'Do you have any food allergies?' We replied 'No.' She also asked if we eat raw foods, and we confirmed we do. I'm sure that is part of their protocol to double-check everything, but it would be a pity if someone who does not like raw food made a reservation here and wasted a seat.\n\nYou can choose between the Omakase ($95) or the Grand Omakase ($195). They are very similar, but the Grand Omakase is more robust in volume. Both end with toro & A5 wagyu.  Everything was presented beautifully and seasoned excellently. There is no soy sauce or wasabi, so that's one less thing to think about. Most people eat the sushi with their hands, as is the traditional way, but they do provide chopsticks too.\n\nOf course I enjoyed the buttery toro (fatty tuna). The wagyu had beautiful marbling. The zuke chutoro (medium fatty tuna) was also excellent with a light sear on top. All the accompanying flavoring agents were excellent. I especially enjoyed the yuzu onion sauce. The only thing I wasn't so fond of was the squid and mountain yam. Once your omakase has concluded, they offer you the a la carte menu of sashimi. Each order comes with one piece. \n\nOur chef was truly friendly, entertaining, and hilarious as he shared stories about being a sushi chef. When he brought out the blowtorch to sear the wagyu, I wanted to take a picture, but he was too quick for me.

My favorites being the kaisui uni (completely melt in your mouth!!) wish it was a bigger piece though, Santa Barbara uni, bbq unagi (soft and very good), toro (amazing), chu toro (they season this extremely well, lots of flavors). Each bite was complete heaven for me. \n\nThis was my boyfriends first time trying Omakase and he normally doesn't like to eat raw fish other than salmon and hamachi, however, he loved every single bite of their omakase and is now addicted! Uh oh..\n\nTheir sake is also very good. I had a glass of reisling, but next time I'd probably refrain from getting this just so I could order more sushi! \n\nService was wonderful. The only suggestion that I have is to be more careful and remember if people have specific food restrictions. I asked for no wasabi in all the dishes, however, we had to remind our waitress at least 3 times and there was still some wasabi in my sushi :( which took away from some of the taste for me. They made it up by giving us free dessert for our anniversary. Desserts were delicious, I would highly recommend the pancetta and I'd probably skip out on the corn ice cream next time. \n\nMake sure you make reservations months in advance if you want to sit at the bar and you can probably get in a months in advance if just for a table. Place is tiny and they have 2 groups for seating, one at 5pm and another at 8pm.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely! This place is definitely not cheap, but it's worth it to splurge for a special occasion or if you want to take yourself out for some high quality japanese food/sushi. The omakase itself is actually a good amount. It won't get you buffet full, but it's definitely enough and if you order a few pieces al a carte, you should be good to go!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-11-09"}, {"excerpts": ["I especially loved the final course where they served us baby sweet white shrimp and toro. \n\n"], "author": "Joyce C.", "review": "I came to Kusakabe with very high expectations. Im probably one of the biggest sushi lovers that you'll ever meet so I was really excited to try this restaurant. Unfortunately it didn't satisfy what I was hoping for. \n\nMy friend and I came for our end of the semester celebration. We both ordered the 95 dollar Omakase. The raw fish here is honestly really fresh and it just melts in your mouth. The halibut from the Sushi Prelude was killed 3 hours before it was served to us. However the Dashi broth was too salty for my liking. Also some items from the Hassun were not for my taste such as the lobster salad with the jelly like thing on top and the persimmon salad with the lotus root chip on top.

Last year, a friend presented me with a gift card (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MdG5viokZhOm2Qpn12kRBQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q). Due to scheduling logistics, it's been difficult to find a person and the time to enjoy this experience with me.  On a recent Friday, I was able to make a 5 pm reservation for two at the table near the host stand, basically at the center of the restaurant.  There are only five tables available which explains the difficulty in securing reservations without early notice.  The remainder of the seating is on the L-shaped sushi bar which seats around twelve or fifteen.

It's actually a flavored take on tamago (egg) sushi where the lobster flavor is infused with the egg.  Enjoyed this as it was an interested take, but just don't get caught up on trying to find the lobster.\nThere were also three desserts on the menu (one being panna cotta), but nothing was attractive to my guest so we passed.\nAs many described, this is authentic Japanese cuisine served in a fine dining atmosphere without the stuffy dress code.

My friends and I were greeted by the host in the front and promptly led to our seats at the bar. The sushi chef in front of us introduced himself to us and asked us about our preferences for fish. We went with the regular omakase over the grand one. The whole experience itself was fun. You got to watch the chef make all the nigiri in front of you. Fresh from their hands straight onto your plate. Our chef was super friendly and let us try to guess which fish was coming next. \n\nMy favorite item of the night was the sashimi of tuna and scallops that came beautifully arranged atop a bowl of ice. The scallops were amazingly sweet and the tuna just melted in your mouth. This item earned 5/5 stars for me and I wish I could have eaten it all night long. Other honorable mentions were the hamachi+mackerel (forgot what the name of the fish was) and the cherrywood smoked tuna. Both were very unique in flavor and the fish was super fresh and supple. \n\nWhat disappointed me the most were the hassun, the toro, and the wagyu beef.

I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish. Spoiler alert: You will likely feel compelled to continue after your omakase is done, there is just so much good stuff to try!\n\nHere's an overview of our meal. Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best.

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers. I thought it greatly added to the experience and having Chef Kusakabe serve us personally was a HUGE plus. In between dishes, we had the pleasure of watching him masterfully prep the sashimi.

My lovely BF surprised me with reservations here for our anniversary and oh my god it was such a beautiful and creative dining experience.\n\nReservations become available online 2 months in advance and for the true omakase experience you gotta sit at the sushi bar so you can watch your chef can personalize each part of the meal to your liking :) \n\nThey only serve omakase, a $150 grand set or the $95 set, with options for add-ons at the end of the meal. Feeling fancy, we opted for the grand set and if you're looking for a time to splurge, this would be it!\n\nThe omakase experience is unique to each restaurant but the creativity and care that goes into each piece is where Kusakabe really shines. Each dish was well-thought out and went beyond just the typical nigiri. Before our meal our sushi chef asked us if there was anything we didn't like or really liked. I really dislike wasabi and usually for omakase they add it to every piece of sushi. However our chef made sure to only put a small amount for all my pieces and I couldn't even taste it!\n\nI believe the menu changes seasonally, but here's what we had:\n- Ichiban Dashi - first up was soup, like a fancier version of miso soup, probably the best soup I've had using dashi broth!\n- Sushi prelude - next we were served 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, one was the king of all sushi - the toro tuna! So soft and buttery, each and every piece. The other 4 pieces were seasonal and the chef makes sure to tell you where each fish comes from :) I believe we had scallop from Santa Barbara!\n- Sashimi - next we were given four different types of sashimi paired with 4 different unique types of sauce/toppings. One included truffle shavings and another was mussels. The flavor combos were so good, although some I liked more than others but definitely all flavors I had never tried before.\n- Hassun - the creativity continues with a box of a random assortment of seafood in all shapes and forms. But presentation on point for errything. Honestly some weren't that tasty (there was a weird seafood cracker that I didn't like) but again, just so unique and such detailed preparation.\n- Soup - this was a creamy cauliflower soup with abalone and abalone mushrooms. Tasted like a lighter version of clam chowder but seriously soo delicious!\n- Sushi Chic - more nigiri sushi including uni (sea urchin) from Santa Barbara! I'm not a big uni fan but oh boy this one was so buttery and creamy and slightly sweet. Definitely can taste the quality and freshness!\n- Sushi Finale - ended with Unagi (BBQ eel) and a choice of toro or wagyu beef. I'd recommend the wagyu beef since it is so tender and they sear it right in front of you with a touch of pepper. It just melted in my mouth like butter.

Being from Boston, we also happen to be seated next to someone from Quincy. Small world.\n\n[Service]: Your dinner experience is impacted depending on where you sit for sushi. I prefer to be seated at the sushi bar, and this time was no different. You are able to mingle with the chef if you like, and get his opinion on what is best that day. Being able to be served by the chef as soon as it is ready is a much better experience than being seated at a table and waiting for a server to bring your food. With that said, the food came out fast.\n\n[Food]: I would like to begin this section and mention the konbu cha (kelp tea) was surprisingly good--I had to hunt some down for myself. Onto the food: Kaiseki style omakase. Konbu cha followed by delicious chutoro, great way to start. At the bar, we're asked what kind of sushi we like, and were tailored to that for the sushi chic (might be different for dining room table).

I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["and I'm still thinking about the toro...\n\n"], "author": "Brianna M.", "review": "Two days later and I'm still thinking about the toro...\n\nHad a great birthday meal here.

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned.

This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.

We ended the meal with the matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Sometimes when you have a matcha green tea flavored dessert, the matcha flavor is either too strong or the dessert is too sweet. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e here wasn't too sweet and the matcha flavor wasn't overpowering, definitely a perfect end to an amazing dinner. \n\nThe dinner took exactly 2 hours and all the courses were timed perfectly.

And, once you pour the konbu dashi broth over, it made it soggy as well.  For the sushi finale, you get to pick between toro or grade A5 wagyu.  We wanted them both so it's an add-on.  We also each added the $14 a piece kaisui uni.  The uni was divine!  The ingredients they use are definitely top notch.  But, you get what you pay for, right!?  Not sure why the dessert is not included with the omakase.  Anyway, dessert is not their forte.  The top of their maccha creme brulee was not even caramelized hard enough like it should be.  Boo, creme brulee is one of my favorite dessert.\n\nOverall, it was an ok experience.  I feel the dining atmosphere was a little intense and stuck-up.

I don't know but it does seem that there are more and more Japanese restaurants that only do Omakase or offer it.  \n\nHaving read about the new Japanese restaurants and in particular quality Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, my wife and I chose Kusakabe because the price seems to be the most reasonable (Omakase wise at least) and we know of the chef's pedigree (Sushi Ran).  The restaurant which is situated right across from Transamerica building offers mostly counter seating and I would recommend counter seating as the chef will drop off sushi piece by piece to you.  It has a very clean feel(good since it's sushi) that has a LA vibe(lounge music going on in the background with intimate lighting).\n\nTo start off with they offer you a piece of toro and man was it beautifully put together.  Then it was followed by a couple pieces of sushi.  What did I have?  I can't remember but the key here is to offer you piece by piece so you enjoy it by itself.  And no, you there's no soy sauce given, they flavor the sushi themselves meaning they may sear it, they may add a bit of soy, they may add shiso leaf or a piece of liver to enhance the flavor but only one dish, our sashimi course which was really fresh came with mirin.  All the nigiri were delicious and fresh.  There was one course which came with five bites which included an oyster with caviar and yuzu, egg white with eel, and crab meat with rice.  The course was beautifully presented and had lot of unique flavors.\n\nAlright now the hot food I thought was a bit lacking.  The duck meatball miso soup.  The duck meatballs were pretty average.  There was another fried wagyu meatball and I couldn't taste any wagyu beef in there so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nService was pretty good although the counter is kind of tight and hard for the server to get in and out to clear your plates.  I appreciate the tiny towel they gave for our fingers (keeping it clean to pick the sushi up).  It was also my wife's birthday and when we ordered dessert, they remembered and brought out the candle and sang happy birthday which was nice.\n\nFor $95, the type of food, the quality of food and the service is a good deal however if you're a big eater you won't be full.  You will need to order a la carte and that's where it can get even more expensive.  For example uni (regular one) is $8.50 for one piece and toro is $12 for one piece.  If you order a few more pieces, that can easily add up.  I would also like to see more explanation into some of the food such as the five bites, it would have been more interesting if they said eat this first, this second, third, fourth and fifth to really enhance the flavors and etc.  \n\nOverall my wife and I both liked the place and I would say it's better than Sushi Ran.

They asked me to leave a cell phone number and suggested we get a drink nearby. We got a drink nearby and at 8:30pm had still not received a call so we walked back over. We were seated right away which was strange, especially since 10 minutes after we were seated they called my cell phone to seat us - clearly they didn't even know we had already been seated. \n\nWe then asked the waitress for her hot sake recommendation. After a brief discussion, we chose a sake and then soon after a cold sake was brought to our table. At this point we were too exasperated to complain and just went with the flow and drank up.

This place has a similar concept to Jiro's where the menu is preset, people are seated at the bar in waves, guests are served in the order they came in, the sushi chefs only serve you the next piece after you consume what is currently served, and everyone gets the same items on the menu. Being an indecisive person who can never choose something off a menu, this was the perfect place. I have a very keen tongue for unfresh fish, but I can say this place serves pretty fresh fish. Every item served was very fresh. The only piece I was slightly disappointed by was the Toro - blue fin fatty tuna served at the end but it was better quality than most toro's I had in the bay. \n\nWhat I really liked about the place is the concept of eating with your hands and the superb service. The table setting includes a small black towel to wipe your fingers after picking up the sushi. Since the restaurant is small and customers come in in waves, it gives the wait staff the opportunity to attend all the customers throughout the night. Our glasses were instantly attended and every time I dropped a grain of rice or a drop of my drink on the table, someone would come by immediately to wipe it off.\n\nThe sushi chef, Ken was also very attentive. During the night, we met a very friendly couple who sat next to us. They came in a little after us so they were served a few items behind us on the menu. Ken noticed we were engaging in a deep conversation about the food so he served the couple slightly quicker so they were caught up to us. \n\nWe were given a menu to order additional sushi items at the end.

", "I love and seek out the highest quality beef in the world.\n"], "author": "Alexandra C.", "review": "I have been waiting to write this review until after I had the pleasure of dining at Masa, in New York. Masa (450$ per person for omakase-+150$pp for kobe supplement), is highly regarded as the best quality sushi and sushi experience in America. \nI have dined at Kusakabe 6 times now and I will continue to frequent this spot. Kusakabe is on the same level as Masa. Kusakabe blows all other SF sushi restaurants out of the water, including Akiko's and Maruya, by far. The experience that dining at Kusakabe delivers far surpasses all sushi experiences that I have had in the US, other than Masa, which is just as good. I will go as far as to say that Kusakabe is the French Laundry of Sushi.\n\nAfter returning from Japan, I have had a difficult time soothing my crave for the love of good sushi. In the Bay Area, it's almost appalling that we don't have great sushi bars, considering the large Japanese population. I had temporarily eased my fix at Sakae Sushi in San Mateo, but after discovering Kusakabe I can finally sleep peacefully at night knowing that quality sushi as great tasting and painstakingly prepared as I found in Japan, can also be found right here in San Francisco. It really is a dream come true, if you are a fellow sushi-lover and self-proclaimed sushi connoisseur, you will surely understand. \n\nThings that you need to understand before you dine here:\n1. True Kaiseki style (Omakase) means that the chef's have prepared a menu for the day, depending on availability of product, and season of fish/food. Adjustments are made accordingly to individual diners tastes. You will be asked at the start of the meal, \"What is your favorite sushi?\" \n2.The menu differs from day to day, week to week, depending upon availability. You will trust in the sushi chef(either  Mitsunori Kusakabe or Ken Ngai) to deliver a mind-blowing, taste-bud tingling experience to your body & soul for 95$ per person. \n3.After you have enjoyed the set number of courses (about 10 filling courses), you may order nigiri/sashimi or hand rolls from the a la carte menu.\n4. Do not come here without a reservation, you won't be seated. Reservations are booked weeks in advance so I recommend scheduling them far apart and many in between. \n5. This is not solely sushi, course items include a choice of soup( summer truffle, or duck dumpling, both miso based), wagyu beef, konbu cha (which is meant to be a palate cleanser ), as well as a small plate that varies with each visit. \n6. Please note that a true omakase takes time, as each piece of sushi is delicately prepared to perfection in front of your eyes. Expect to dine for 2-3 hours and enjoy every minute of the experience.\n\nAt just 95$ per person, some may see this as a deal, others as a special occasion splurge , either way, regardless of your budget,  you are truly getting the finest fish and quality ingredients in the world at Kusakabe. You will leave feeling warm, fuzzy, satisfied and enlightened. \n\nI am an Uni fiend, so I love to try all of the uni types available on the a la carte menu. My favorite is the Bafun Uni, if you love uni, you will respect the way it is prepared at Kusakabe. \nI am hooked on the summer truffle miso soup, which I expect will soon disappear as we move on to winter truffle season. I am highly anticipated any new supplements to the menu as I know they will be just as delicious.\nI prefer the wagyu beef over the toro option at the end of the meal, but it's personal preference as both are wonderfully prepared.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing.

It was so enthralling to observe him assemble each perfect piece of sushi, and I also really enjoyed listening to the description of each course as it was being served.

Yes, it's better than even the sushi at the Tokyo fish market (albeit more expensive; but so is a flight to Japan).\n\nKusakabe blends traditional and modern perfectly. It provides multiple complex flavors with each bite. It's made to please everyone and it's quite different than Omakase's edomae style, for example. It's very San Francisco's and it incorporates things like avocado. That being said it still keeps the tradition of sushi and respectfully modernizes it and elevates the flavor profiles. Nothing quite like it.\n\nMake sure to ask to be seated at the bar so you can converse with your chef and make it a personal experience (bonus points: ask for the main Chef, Mitsunori). Ask them about why they are there and how hard they had to work to get where they are. Trust me, it will change your perspective on sushi and you'll find a new appreciation for the art (oh and if you don't know proper etiquette, they'll teach you that, too).

Online reservation is very convenient, unlike some other restaurants calling them is the only way to make reservation.

Seeing all the great reviews and mouthwatering photos of the sushi gave us really high expectation for this place. We were 30 minutes early(we though there would be traffic but there was none) but was seated promptly. We were given three menus: omakase/petite omakase menu, sake/wine pairing menu, regular sake/wine menu. The server didn't tell us there was an a la carte menu but I heard the server at the next table told his customers and explained the difference between the two omakase menu. I wanted to do the petite omakase and ordered from a la carte menu afterwards, but my boyfriend wanted to try the full omakase. It was his birthday so I let him pick whatever. We didn't do the pairing because we tried wine pairing at another restaurant on my birthday and I was buzzed half way through and couldn't enjoy the rest of the meal. However we did ordered an 8oz sake to drink slowly throughout the course. The first half of the menu was AMAZING. The fish were very fresh and flavorful. The second half of the menu was not as amazing as the first half. Maybe because I was getting full since I ate a lot in the morning. I should have thought it through. For the last 4-5 courses I was shoveling food down my throat without really spent time tasting them in my mouth. I was so full I had to give a few pieces of my sushi to my boyfriend. I am sure the sushi courses would taste a lot better if I had the appetite. However I didn't really enjoy the petit plates and the wagyu tongue stew no matter if I was full or not.

An important thing to point out is we were NEVER served the Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly like the menu stated. Instead we were served Negitoro, which is minced fatty tuna with micro onion on a roasted seaweed. Those are two very different things, I wanted to ask why we were served the negitoro instead of the fatty tuna belly, but since my friends didn't mention I didn't want to be particular. Now that I think about it, I am quite angry that the manager didn't mention anything at all about switching our menu.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, a review on the food that we DID have. It was a 10 course menu (with 2 soups) and it was more than enough. A tip for everyone, if you want to do a la carte towards the end, I suggest you choose the regular Omakase with less courses. Actually with the Grand Omakase, there is a course with non-sashimi/sushi dish. So if you here for the sushi/sashimi definitely choose the regular Omakase then do a la carte at the end.\u00a0\n\nOne thing to note about the sushi here is that they seasoned all their rice. At first it looked like brown rice, then we realized every piece of rice has soy sauce seasoned so the flavor is even throughout. My favorite sushi\u00a0would definitely be the Oshinogi with Scallop+Uni sushi,\u00a0Nata with poached egg on spoon, the uni sushi and surprisingly the Shima Aji (stripe jack) which is the chef's choice of sushi. The Hassun which included 6 small plates was also very tasty, I love how the food is like art. The wagyu beef tartare was one of the most delicious tartare that I ever had.\u00a0The most disappointing course would definitely be the seared A5 Wagyu sushi, they over-seasoned it with too much pepper and salt overpowering the taste of the wagyu. It felt like they wasted a perfectly fine piece of meat, except the meat itself had a bit too much lines in it.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kusakabe for Omakase on a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. It seems like a popular date place, you can impress somebody\u00a0by bringing them here and eating in front of the sushi bar. It's a shame we didn't get to sit there to watch as the sushi chef prepare our dishes. There might have been 1 or 2 disappointment, nevertheless it was a good experience.

Nothing unusual (after all, there are only three ingredients in this fish-based broth), but very clean tasting and a nice way to start the meal.\n\nCourse #2: The zuku chutoro (bluefin medium fatty tuna) was seared on one side, giving the fish a great texture to complement its flavors. The hirame halibut with its own liver had a slightly spicy kick, and the cold-smoked bonito (katsuo) resounded with the flavors of the wood smoke.\n\nCourse #3: Bluefin sashimi and poached amberjack (a surprising favorite of mine). These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle.

Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience! The restaurant itself is small but homey and authentic (the bathroom even features an automated Japanese toilet). The service is the epitome of Japanese hospitality and the prices are exorbitant, so make sure to come with an appreciation of the work, care, and quality that goes behind each bite of food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I go to experience the A5 wagyu beef nigiri, and it blew my mind.

We were literally the last ones in the restaurant the night before the news broke that Kusakabe lost its Star. Compared to Wako, Kusakabe was probably not as worth the money and the fish at Wako was of slightly higher quality than here, hence the -0.5 stars. However, it is still a reasonable meal at $98 for the quality of the fish and craftsmanship of the nigiri. I would definitely recommend trying to get a reservation if you have a special event to celebrate. \n\n[Omakase]\nA-la-carte menu is always the best part of omakase, in my opinion. I go to experience the A5 wagyu beef nigiri, and it blew my mind. My other favorite roll was the Toro. I didn't know fish could taste like this (I guess it does at $15 extra per piece). I also really like the Sashimi. Oyster set was very creative. Since it was my birthday, the restaurant gave me a sorbet on the house that I thought was really nice! Otherwise, desert is extra. I did still feel hungry after my regular Omakase, so I would recommend maybe upgrading to the Grand.  You're going to want to spend more on extra nigiri at the end anyway so you might as well.\n\n[Service / Decor]\nOur chef was great. He explained each piece to us and, sitting at the bar, we were able to watch the nigiri come to life right before our eyes. I really like the decor of the restaurant. It was slightly larger than the overage Omakase, but still cozy and well lit. \n\nOverall, I think Kusakabe is a great restaurant that offers great Omakase with pricing in line with comparable restaurants.

This place is very small and a little hidden but has a cute entrance through a curtain. The inside had a very nice ambiance going on and was very intimate.

I say you should get the grand omakase because it's so much more worth it if you're already going to spend $$$$ - might as well go all out! I also recommend that you try both the a5 wagyu and the toro... AND the UNI!! I can tell you that their uni here is to die for!! Specifically their deep sea hokkaido uni - it literally melts in your mouth and taste like heaven for a few seconds.

They are also quick to refill your drinks/clean your tables and all other manners they are quick to address. Please do make some time if you come to the later seating.

We opted for the regular $98 omakase menu. After we ordered, they gave us the dashi broth, along with warm towels and other eating utensils. We had more than one server bring us our food, and each one explained what they had placed on the table. I got too excited when they brought the sushi out so I didn't get to take pictures of the first sushi course. It was a piece of cured bluefin chutoro sushi that had a wonderful smoky flavor, paired with a piece of fresh fish served as is (not cured, marinated, etc.). You have one piece that was heavily flavored with soy sauce contrasting with another that was light and fresh, no frills. It was a very thoughtful pairing that not only didn't overwhelm my palate, but brought out the flavor of each piece of sushi. This theme continued throughout the meal with the sushi plates. \n\nEventually, after a few rounds of sushi and sashimi, they brought out the Hassun, which consisted of 6 tiny dishes, and was the most beautifully plated out of all the courses. I loved that you got a tiny bite of everything, rather than one entree. I won't go over everything, but wasn't blown away by the taste of the overall dish. I'm sure people who love clams would like the cold clam soup. I felt like it really brought out the flavor of the clams. I didn't particularly like it, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of clams. There was a lightly fried shrimp and taro, like shrimp and taro karage. Tasted like what you would expect. It also came with something that tasted like wagyu croquette, covered in crispy rice. It was quite small, so it was difficult to taste the wagyu. \n\nWe ended the meal with more fresh and melt-in-your-mouth sushi: a fun and delicious DIY hand roll served with scallop sushi topped with uni. They brought out an add-ons menu if we wanted to order anything a la carte. We were pretty satisfied, so we didn't add get anything else. After that, they came out with what I think was a yuzu sorbet, with a candle, on the house! I had forgot that they called ahead about a week before to ask if we were coming for any special reason. I had mentioned to them on the phone that it was my boyfriend's birthday. It was a nice surprise. The sorbet itself had a nice citrusy flavor, and came in a really cute little tea cup. \n\nIn general, I really liked the quality of the sushi and sashimi, along with the their flavors and the little additions and sauces served with them. This was the main reason fo coming here. There warm dishes and soups weren't bad, but they definitely weren't the stars of the show. The servers were also all really nice and professional.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-13"}, {"excerpts": ["miyazaki wagyu beef - you really can't go wrong with either.

"], "author": "Alana L.", "review": "I have always loved Japanese food for its delicate and umami flavors. The level of detail and care put into all Japanese dishes has always astounded me. I am a huge fan of donburis, udon noodles, and of course, sushi. However, a couple of months ago, I had a totally new, mind-blowing, and quite frankly, life-changing culinary experience with Japanese cuisine. For my birthday, my friend took me out for omakase style sushi in San Francisco. The term \"omakase\" is a Japanese phrase that means \"I'll leave it up to you(the chef).\" The whole sushi meal is decided by the chef, and is tailored towards which fishes are in season at the time, and whatever flavors the chef wants to present that night, so it is a meal you should go into with zero expectations. \n\nWe went to KUSAKABE, a 1-Michelin starred omakase restaurant placed in the heart of San Francisco, California's financial district. This meal consisted of 15-20 different types of nigiri, or slices of raw fish/meat over rice. We were seated at a simple, wooden bar, and were assigned 1 chef for the entire night to take us through the omakase experience. Every piece was placed in front of us, one at a time, after we had finished each previous piece. Everything was extremely simple and clean, but it was some of the most fresh and most melt-in-my-mouth sushi experiences I had ever had. I practically melted along with each piece of sushi in my mouth. \n\nPriced at $165 per person for the \"Grand Omakase\" dinner, you better bet you're going to get a mind-blowing food experience. I can go on and on for hours about each piece of sushi I had that night, but I will just point out some of my highlights:\n\n- One of the most memorable and unique pieces was the Tsukiji fish market squid nigiri with crystallized egg yolk and a single yuzu leaf. It was almost \"rubbery\" in texture but extremely smooth and silky, the egg provided a creamy accent, and the yuzu was a pop of fresh lemon taste. This single bite was the most unique, and most harmonious pieces of food I have ever eaten. \n\n- The next piece that truly stood out to me was the A5 wagyu beef nigiri. It was a raw piece of A5 wagyu beef placed on top of rice, and torched so it was seared on top, yet perfectly rare in the middle. A5 is the highest possible grade of beef, and it was marvelous and extremely \"meaty\" tasting. I had never had beef that was so fatty, pure, and clean tasting before, and I'm not sure how many more times in my life I'll be able to have beef that good. My jaw physically dropped after this one. \n\nKUSAKABE provided a life-changing Japanese food experience and I hope that everyone has the opportunity to try omakase sushi at least once in their lives, especially if they love sushi and Japanese culture. Even if you don't love or know much about Japanese culture, though, this would be a great introduction. If anyone ever wants to learn more about omakase too, and the history of it, I would highly recommend watching the documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" which is about a famous sushi chef in Japan whose restaurant takes reservations 1 year in advanced because it is so well-known for its omakase. I hope to try different omakase restaurants in my life when I am older and have more money to do so. But for now, I will just fondly remember and dream of this KUSAKABE experience", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-10-22"}, {"excerpts": ["- Wagyu beef: AMAZING, beautiful marbling\n"], "author": "Vera N.", "review": "4.5 stars because I wasn't able to get bar seating, but rounded up.

They hold reservations for latecomers for 15 minutes. Our empty seats and place settings were waiting for us when we arrived. The dining area consists of a very long sushi bar and a couple of tables by the door. Our sushi chef explained that the restaurant design deliberately omitted the glass fish case so the patrons can easily see the chefs prepare food. The tables are also deliberately the same height, so even people who do not sit at the sushi bar can get a good view of the sushi chefs. So thoughtful.\n\nOur server asked us the usual 'Do you have any food allergies?' We replied 'No.' She also asked if we eat raw foods, and we confirmed we do. I'm sure that is part of their protocol to double-check everything, but it would be a pity if someone who does not like raw food made a reservation here and wasted a seat.\n\nYou can choose between the Omakase ($95) or the Grand Omakase ($195). They are very similar, but the Grand Omakase is more robust in volume. Both end with toro & A5 wagyu.  Everything was presented beautifully and seasoned excellently. There is no soy sauce or wasabi, so that's one less thing to think about. Most people eat the sushi with their hands, as is the traditional way, but they do provide chopsticks too.\n\nOf course I enjoyed the buttery toro (fatty tuna). The wagyu had beautiful marbling. The zuke chutoro (medium fatty tuna) was also excellent with a light sear on top. All the accompanying flavoring agents were excellent. I especially enjoyed the yuzu onion sauce. The only thing I wasn't so fond of was the squid and mountain yam. Once your omakase has concluded, they offer you the a la carte menu of sashimi. Each order comes with one piece. \n\nOur chef was truly friendly, entertaining, and hilarious as he shared stories about being a sushi chef.

This was my first Michelin star dining experience and I am so glad it was as it was absolutely amazing. \n\nWe started off with the Omakase courses which were 7 courses for $95pp. I wasn't a huge fan of the seaweed drink they give you to cleanse your palette. My favorites of the courses were the chu toro and copper salmon nigiri, although pretty much all the nigiri they served as part of the omakase were delicious. Each piece was specially seasoned and super fresh. I loved the turtle soup dish (can't believe I ate a cute little turtle), but  shockingly, it was amazing. The dish with two crispy fish in a truffle sauce and shishito pepper was another favorite of mine. Pretty much licked the dish clean because the truffle sauce was so tasty. I also really enjoyed the 5 piece le petit sampler plate of the chefs specials. Huge fan of the crispy eggplant and the tuna over rice piece. \n\nFor the last piece,we chose the a5 wagyu sushi. I gotta say that I was not completely blown away with this piece. I actually think that Sushi Sams in San Mateo has a better A5. I mean it was definitely good, but not as amazing as I was hoping for. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of sushi al a carte. My favorites being the kaisui uni (completely melt in your mouth!!) wish it was a bigger piece though, Santa Barbara uni, bbq unagi (soft and very good), toro (amazing), chu toro (they season this extremely well, lots of flavors). Each bite was complete heaven for me. \n\nThis was my boyfriends first time trying Omakase and he normally doesn't like to eat raw fish other than salmon and hamachi, however, he loved every single bite of their omakase and is now addicted! Uh oh..\n\nTheir sake is also very good. I had a glass of reisling, but next time I'd probably refrain from getting this just so I could order more sushi! \n\nService was wonderful. The only suggestion that I have is to be more careful and remember if people have specific food restrictions. I asked for no wasabi in all the dishes, however, we had to remind our waitress at least 3 times and there was still some wasabi in my sushi :( which took away from some of the taste for me. They made it up by giving us free dessert for our anniversary. Desserts were delicious, I would highly recommend the pancetta and I'd probably skip out on the corn ice cream next time. \n\nMake sure you make reservations months in advance if you want to sit at the bar and you can probably get in a months in advance if just for a table. Place is tiny and they have 2 groups for seating, one at 5pm and another at 8pm.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely! This place is definitely not cheap, but it's worth it to splurge for a special occasion or if you want to take yourself out for some high quality japanese food/sushi.

Last year, a friend presented me with a gift card (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MdG5viokZhOm2Qpn12kRBQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q). Due to scheduling logistics, it's been difficult to find a person and the time to enjoy this experience with me.  On a recent Friday, I was able to make a 5 pm reservation for two at the table near the host stand, basically at the center of the restaurant.  There are only five tables available which explains the difficulty in securing reservations without early notice.  The remainder of the seating is on the L-shaped sushi bar which seats around twelve or fifteen.  After my guest arrived, here's what we enjoyed:\n\nAmuse\nKonbu cha - Translates to kelp tea, this is more like a soup to me.  Sorry, I drank this without taking a picture as I thought it was \"just tea\".  Perfect elixir for foggy SF evenings.\n\nFirst\nNigiri toro, halibut, bonito (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DmkADPQrPhbu7Ri_PhcvaQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The first and the third were my favorites... how can you go wrong with those two?!\n\nSecond\nSashimi scallop and maguro (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rkKjr_pOWEbDC8rDxyMNDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pristine, fresh, and tender.  They were a nice contrast with one being soft (scallop) and the other firm (maguro).\n\nThird\nUmami tomato soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KJTATBDka63tOnd0NxlrGw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My eyes widened as I searched for the tomato element.  There is a large meatball at the center of this which reminds me of the chicken meatball at Delica in the Ferry Building.\n\nFourth\nHassun, oysters served with French caviar and four petit plates (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qyg_iiz7Brq9vioVpmRjcQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Like the second, fourth, and fifth plates (from the left) the most.

It's actually a flavored take on tamago (egg) sushi where the lobster flavor is infused with the egg.  Enjoyed this as it was an interested take, but just don't get caught up on trying to find the lobster.\nThere were also three desserts on the menu (one being panna cotta), but nothing was attractive to my guest so we passed.\nAs many described, this is authentic Japanese cuisine served in a fine dining atmosphere without the stuffy dress code.

We did not make a selection for seating preference, and we ended up sitting up at the sushi bar, which ended up being a great experience as we got to interact with our sushi chef and see how each piece is made. \n\nFOOD:\nWe were blown away by the food from the first bite. We went with the full Omakase menu and did not regret it one bit. They have a petite omakase menu which is a little shorter and cheaper, but I would recommend going with the full menu as some of my favorites were in the full menu. They do ask for allergies beforehand, and were careful to avoid any allergens (mine was scallop). Each item is thoughtfully made and presented, and we did feel full after our meal. I loved almost everything they put in front of me, although I felt that the tofu w/carrot could have been a little more flavorful. At the end of the meal, you get an a la carte menu where you can order extras, but we were stuffed. Despite this, we still ordered dessert--not because we had room, but because we were certain that the dessert would be amazing. We got the creme brulee, which was AMAZING. Was hesitant at first because I was not sure I could handle something so heavy while being so full, but their version is definitely lighter and more refreshing, but still creamy. I would say this is my favorite version of creme brulee that I've had. We also got the sorbet, which was also fantastic. I'm not a fan of heavy desserts, so these two were absolutely on point.  P.S. I still dream about the Zuke chutoro and the wagyu. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nLovely, warm, serene. Lots of wood and clean lines.

I booked the place for my birthday dinner and psyched myself up for what I was hoping to be an amazing meal. We walked in on a Friday night at 8pm for our 8:15pm reservation. My friends and I were greeted by the host in the front and promptly led to our seats at the bar. The sushi chef in front of us introduced himself to us and asked us about our preferences for fish. We went with the regular omakase over the grand one. The whole experience itself was fun. You got to watch the chef make all the nigiri in front of you. Fresh from their hands straight onto your plate. Our chef was super friendly and let us try to guess which fish was coming next. \n\nMy favorite item of the night was the sashimi of tuna and scallops that came beautifully arranged atop a bowl of ice. The scallops were amazingly sweet and the tuna just melted in your mouth. This item earned 5/5 stars for me and I wish I could have eaten it all night long. Other honorable mentions were the hamachi+mackerel (forgot what the name of the fish was) and the cherrywood smoked tuna. Both were very unique in flavor and the fish was super fresh and supple. \n\nWhat disappointed me the most were the hassun, the toro, and the wagyu beef. The hassun was gorgeously presented, but of all the items on the dish, not a single one stood out to me. The toro was chewy and nothing near the melt in the mouth quality I was hoping for. Same went for the wagyu beef. It was so chewy that I ended up swallowing the beef whole. For $15 extra a piece, I was quite bitter about ordering it after eating it. \n\nFor $100 for an omakase, I would most likely not be coming back here anytime soon. The quality of the fish was decent, but the items themselves were nothing to rave over. I will say that if you want to come here, ask for a reservation at the bar. It is well worth it. I honestly think the whole experience was as good as it was because we sat at the bar instead of at the tables. The food itself gets a 3/5 stars for me, but the service was a 5/5. \n\nCons: \n- Pricey (but most people come here knowing they are going to have to dish out a good chunk of money for this meal)\n- Hard to find parking (true for a lot of places around SF though)\n- A lot of courses were lackluster and left me wanting more \n\nPros: \n- Great service \n- Sushi chef was super friendly and accommodating\n- Gorgeous interior decor and nice ambiance", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-09-25"}, {"excerpts": ["It's hard to pick a favorite of the night, but I'd have to say aside from the obvious A5 Wagyu and toro, the white Alaskan salmon was to die for. \n\n"], "author": "Mara A.", "review": "Thank you Kusakabe for an amazing dining experience to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.\n\nThe grand omakase is definitely the way to go.

I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish. Spoiler alert: You will likely feel compelled to continue after your omakase is done, there is just so much good stuff to try!\n\nHere's an overview of our meal. Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best.

My mother is just as crazy about sushi as I am (if not more) and after taking her to Wakuriya for her birthday, I had to find a comparable restaurant for Mother's day. Kusakabe is definitely of the same caliber as Wakuriya but the experience is entirely different.\n\nOmakase style dinner is pretty much the Japanese version of prix fixe except with a little bit more excitement to it because certain parts of the menu (specifically the sashimi) will change depending on what the sushi chef feels like making. That being said, the chances of you liking every single type of sashimi may not be 100% but that's to be expected with any tasting menu. Still, while certain cuts of sashimi were too thick or too chewy for my taste, there's no denying the freshness and quality of the fish. Of the omakase menu, my favorites were the Shigoku oyster with caviar with the petite plates, the miso glazed alaskan halibut, and the grade A5 wagyu beef. SO DELICIOUS. I'll have seconds of those three dishes, please.\n\nAfter the omakase (which lasts about 1.5 hours), they give you an a la carte menu to order from (you can only do a la carte after omakase). We tried the Aoebi (steamed blue prawn with crystallized egg yolk) - yummy but not what I expected. I imagined the crystallized egg yolk to look and taste different but it kind of just looked like yellow dyed roe and didn't really taste like anything. The steamed blue prawn was delicious though but I'm not quite sure if it's worth $7.5 per piece. We also tried the Sakuramasu (Japanese cherry salmon with cherry leaf) - yummy and melts in your mouth. The cherry salmon did not have the typical milky taste people tend to associate with salmon; the taste was milder but still delicious. For dessert, we each got a scoop of sweet potato ice cream which was super yummy! :)\n\nAtmosphere is slightly busier than Wakuriya. They had about 4 servers and 5 sushi chefs (W only has one server and one sushi chef). The place is also slightly bigger and was able to accommodate approx. 20 people when we were there. \n\nDining experience lasted about 2.5 hours and was paced perfectly. We didn't feel rushed throughout the meal nor did we have any awkwardly long wait time in between dishes.\n\nPricing wise, the omakase is $95 per person which I think is very reasonable for a Michelin star restaurant. Their a la carte items are more expensive if you consider each piece of nigiri is priced at around $7 to $15. This adds up fast but still, I would recommend trying one or two items from the a la carte menu and of course getting dessert!\n\nOnly street parking available but we found parking easy enough! There are a bunch of metered parking spaces available on Washington Street.\n\nTo sum it up, GO GO GO. Don't even think about the price or whatever else is stopping you.

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers. I thought it greatly added to the experience and having Chef Kusakabe serve us personally was a HUGE plus. In between dishes, we had the pleasure of watching him masterfully prep the sashimi.

Feeling fancy, we opted for the grand set and if you're looking for a time to splurge, this would be it!\n\nThe omakase experience is unique to each restaurant but the creativity and care that goes into each piece is where Kusakabe really shines. Each dish was well-thought out and went beyond just the typical nigiri. Before our meal our sushi chef asked us if there was anything we didn't like or really liked. I really dislike wasabi and usually for omakase they add it to every piece of sushi. However our chef made sure to only put a small amount for all my pieces and I couldn't even taste it!\n\nI believe the menu changes seasonally, but here's what we had:\n- Ichiban Dashi - first up was soup, like a fancier version of miso soup, probably the best soup I've had using dashi broth!\n- Sushi prelude - next we were served 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, one was the king of all sushi - the toro tuna! So soft and buttery, each and every piece. The other 4 pieces were seasonal and the chef makes sure to tell you where each fish comes from :) I believe we had scallop from Santa Barbara!\n- Sashimi - next we were given four different types of sashimi paired with 4 different unique types of sauce/toppings. One included truffle shavings and another was mussels. The flavor combos were so good, although some I liked more than others but definitely all flavors I had never tried before.\n- Hassun - the creativity continues with a box of a random assortment of seafood in all shapes and forms. But presentation on point for errything. Honestly some weren't that tasty (there was a weird seafood cracker that I didn't like) but again, just so unique and such detailed preparation.\n- Soup - this was a creamy cauliflower soup with abalone and abalone mushrooms. Tasted like a lighter version of clam chowder but seriously soo delicious!\n- Sushi Chic - more nigiri sushi including uni (sea urchin) from Santa Barbara! I'm not a big uni fan but oh boy this one was so buttery and creamy and slightly sweet. Definitely can taste the quality and freshness!\n- Sushi Finale - ended with Unagi (BBQ eel) and a choice of toro or wagyu beef. I'd recommend the wagyu beef since it is so tender and they sear it right in front of you with a touch of pepper. It just melted in my mouth like butter.

The fish is fresh and the flavors are not overwhelming. Good and simple does the trick. We recently had the \"grand omakase\" and it was filling for me. Why opt for the GRAND version? It has more sushi pieces and popular items that are usually ordered are already included. In the end, the GRAND will save you more money.\nThe regular Omakase is still an excellent option. The experience and quality of fish does not change with the regular omakase. Only difference will be the portion and maybe the wagyu beef at the end. \n\nSAKE: Kusakabe offers a wine or sake pairing. My husband always tried the sake and I would take little sips just to try (I'm a lightweight.). Let me tell you, this place serves some of the best sake! I'm definitely more of a sake person than wine. You don't have to do the pairing but I do suggest the Dassai \"Centrifuge.\" It's light, sweet, and not too dry. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Excellent. I have nothing more to say except that they are on point. \n\nCON: pricey but it is high quality.

Kusakabe uses soy sauce, teriyaki, and lemon to enhance the delicate flavors of fish, so no need to add it yourself.

Umami Soup - Personally, though there was too much mushroom for my taste, but overall good, delicate dish. Quintessential umami flavor. Not sure if I liked the rice and lotus root dumpling, but I'm glad I tried it. \n5. Hassun (Le Petite Plats) - I did not enjoy the mushroom or egg plats, but the others were wonderful. My favorite was the warm truffle croquette and caviar oyster.\n6. Warm Dish - The flavor was too subtle. It needed a kick like an added spice. By this dish, I was getting sick of the mushrooms, so I did not eat the mushroom portion. I'm also not a fan of sweet potato (satsuma-imo), but it was an interesting dish because of the combination. I wish it had an added crunch to contrast the soft foods. If you are brave, look up Shirako, which is in the dish.  \n7. Three kinds of sushi - All delicious!\n8. Sushi finale (Your Choice) - I chose A5 Grade wagyu beef, lightly seared. My favorite sushi of the entire meal! A wonderful finale. \n\nFor my birthday, Kusakabe also gave me a complimentary dessert, Chestnut ice cream - a unique dessert, but not something I would crave.

I prefer to be seated at the sushi bar, and this time was no different. You are able to mingle with the chef if you like, and get his opinion on what is best that day.

My friend had come before and recommended the grand omakase ($150/pp) so we went with that. Our menu items were: \n-ichiban dashi (fresh brewed broth from dried kombu and katsuo-bushi\n-zuke chutoro, bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce and four pieces of seasonal sushi\n-Chef's four kind of sashimi with Italian summer truffle, and Yuzu onion sauce\n-Japanese oyster with caviar\n-Hako-Zushi of the day\n-Six kinds of Chef's assorted petits plats (oyster, fried crab claws, eggplants, etc)\n-Snap pea surinagashi (soup) with crispy Arare Alaskan Kinki and white bean paste\n-Hokkaido sea urchin and three kinds of seasonal fish\n-Shirayaki fresh BBQ white eel\n-Toro or Miyazaki Wagyu beef\n\nIn general I thought the nigiri pieces were killer. Super delicious, really well done. Easily the best in the city. Unfortunately, the other things, where were more tapas style, I was not a big fan of. I thought they were fine, clearly well executed, but just not as standout or memorable.\n\nI think the real move here is to actually get the shorter omakase and then if you're still hungry, pay extra money for extra pieces. That additional $50-60/pp I think would have been better spent on actual nigiri pieces which were really just WOW. Fish was super fresh, the combinations that they had were so creative and innovative, it really was a different league. \n\nWhat surprised me and disappointed me about the evening was the service. The SO and I had a really unpleasant experience with our waitress. Overall, I just felt like she gave us a lot of attitude, was pretty condescending, and treated us as if we were kids who had never eaten at a nice restaurant before. A couple of examples. I asked for what teas were available, and she started off listing them off in the Japanese form (e.g. hojicha) and the translation, but then stopped, and started to just give them in English cause I presume she thought I didn't know anything about Japanese tea. I'm no expert but I at least know what I'm ordering... then she came back and forgot my order... The SO also asked for sake recommendations, and he admittedly doesn't know a ton about sake, but she gave him a bit of sass about his lack of descriptors for what he wanted. It just gave us a really uncomfortable feeling while we were dining. I was also surprised because generally a Michelin restaurant slays at service. Frankly, I've been to triples when I had less eating experience and people were never condescending to me. That was the low point of our meal.\n\nOtherwise, everyone else we met was fun and great. Our sushi chef was a really knowledgable nice guy, and most people were friendly. They brought out a yuzu ice cream with a candle and the restaurant sang happy birthday to the SO which I thought was cute and a wonderful gesture. \n\nUltimately, Kusakabe I think does have the best nigiri in the city. I think people's opinions of the omakase will vary depending on how much they like nigiri, but it's definitely pretty 50-50 nigiri and non nigiri pieces.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-27"}, {"excerpts": ["/uni, Toro, Wagyu beef, Medium blue fin tuna, white eel, and homemade sesame ice cream with hot sauce (additional fee for dessert).\n\n"], "author": "Gina T.", "review": "Wanted to hit the three SF Michelin sushi/omakase restaurants, and Kusakabe was our final stop after Omakase and Wako.  At each restaurant, we had the full omakase menu.  \n\nOverall, Kusakabe's quality of fish is on par with both Omakase and Wako.  However, we felt that the execution of many items was subpar.  Several nigiri and kitchen items were overpowered by some component of the dish, whether it be too much cucumber rolled within trout, too much acid (lemon) on the oyster,  or beans that dominated the crab salad.  We just want the fish to shine.\n\nOn the plus side, Kusakabe's rice was well cooked and seasoned.  We liked that, proportionally, the balance of fish to rice was just right.  Wako, on the other hand, served too much rice and it was not as well flavored.  The items that really stood out for us at Kusakabe:  Cauliflower/abalone soup, Bonito, Scallop w/uni, Toro, Wagyu beef, Medium blue fin tuna, white eel, and homemade sesame ice cream with hot sauce (additional fee for dessert).\n\nAmbiance wise, Kusakabe is much more casual, loud and impersonal than Omakase and Wako.  The kitchen is busy, busy, busy, and there is much more limited chef interaction at the bar as compared to Omakase and Wako, both of which are quiet, subdued, and intimate.  It really depends on what you prefer.  If you're on a casual friend's night out, go to Kusakabe so you can talk and laugh as loud as you like.

I'd have to say this repeated itself over and over again throughout the omakase meal. \n\nMy part also ordered a large amount of Ala carte items after the tasting menu.

Sashimi: the maguro and barracuda were meant to be dipped with either house grated onion with yuzu, chive, and salt or traditional soy sauce + wasabi\n  - Thinly sliced salmon wrapped around cucumber with a bamboo charcoal miso: the miso was very unique \n  - Red snapper: wrapped with ankimo, topped with Italian summer truffle and sitting on a ponzu truffle gelee.

The wakame was my favorite part of the dish\n  - Box sushi: tuna topped with bonito flakes\n  - Box sushi: tamago with a layer of crab underneath, topped with a goji berry \n  - Fried fish with red onion and a vinegar dashi\n\n5. Soup: Puree of cauliflower, which was very rich tasting. It came with a sweet potato paste in the center for more sweetness and thickness, abalone, trumpet mushrooms, abalone mushrooms\n\n6. Sushi Chic and Sushi Finale \n  - Shima aji: topped with daikon and yuzu\n  - Arctic char: with sea salt and yuzu \n  - Sanma: with grated ginger lime zest, and chives\n  - Uni, but I opted for non uni, and it was a torched oily snapper cured in kombu, which was really good \n  - Shirayaki: BBQ white eel, finished with a light drizzle of sauce and sansho pepper. I like that the sauce doesn't obscure the fish\n  - Wagyu (you could also choose toro): A5, super smooth and buttery\n\nExtras: prices range from $6-15 per piece (tamago vs uni)\n  - Jin kinmedai: golden eye snapper smoked in cherry wood\n  - Kisu: whiting cured with bonito and konbu\n\nWe were too full for dessert by the end.

The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["The Miyazaki Wagyu was also phenomenal - makes me miss Japan so much!

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.

Every piece of nigiri or dish presented to us was SO EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS. The fish literally MELTED in our mouths. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Everything was plated nicely which made it that much more appetizing too. What I really appreciated was Chef Nori's knife skills. He does all the cutting of the sashimi, and there would be assistants on each side of him that makes the nigiri rice. We got suuuuper lucky though, because we sat in the middle right in front of the chef, so not only did we get to admire his skills, but we were also served PERSONALLY by him! Dream come true for a sushi fanatic like myself. My only regret was the sushi finale, we expected it to go out with a *BANG* but it was more of a silent *bang*, the A5 wagyu and toro was slightly chewy. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the king salmon, zuke, and uni.

And it was by chance and an absolute pleasure to be sitting at the bar, right in front of him, and being personally served by a master. It was like having front row seats to watching the master in action. \n\nThe whole meal was traditional in some sense (i.e. rice portion, rice temperature, no personal soy sauce), but non traditional in other ways that work. They offer only one choice -- $95 omakase dinner which is explores kaiseki principals to create a multi-course sushi menu. It was fascinating to watch him meticulously slice each fish and assemble it. Of course we ate everything that was offered on the menu, even getting both options where there were options.

This place keeps the options simple and offers all guests a $95 omakase menu with the option to add a la carte items. The restaurant itself is located right next to the Transamerica building and the d\u00e9cor is simple with multiple seats at the sushi bar with around 6-8 additional tables throughout the dining area. Although I was unable to sit at the sushi bar, I highly recommend folks do this. Even from my seat, it was quite a delight to watch the sushi chefs at work. We were seated immediately and servers came over to take our drink order. There is a good selection of Sake here so I am already a fan.\n\nThis joint is the true omakase as the chefs determine what they will prepare daily depending on the availability of product and the season for certain types of fishes. One thing I want to warn yelpers is that this is a true dining experience and not purely just a sushi joint. If you are coming here to just eat sushi, you have the opportunity to order the a la carte but don't write off the rest of the menu. ON the day we went our menu consisted of the \"tea\", sushi prelude involving a few pieces of nigiri, a sashimi selection, miso soup, unique sushi, sushi plate, sushi chic, tomato tomato tomato (not a typo), and sushi finale. I won't even need to go into to detail but the presentation was just spectacular and the freshness of the fish was mind-blowing. This is without a doubt the best sushi restaurant in SF. The sequencing of the dishes was great to allow palette cleansing and just perfect consistency and rice ratio. The simplicity of this establishment and its ability to deliver masterful ingredients was amazing. I was thoroughly full after the course menu but I have to recommend EVERYONE to try the Toro AND the wagyu for the sushi finale. The toro was nothing like I had ever seen/tasted and just absolute melt in your mouth. \n\nThis entire experience was top notch and I appreciated the simplistic approach to fine cuisine.

The focus is mostly on the sushi and sashimi so although it's coursed and plated like kaiseki there aren't all the courses and dishes you would find in a full kaiseki meal in Japan.\n\nAs part of the omakase we had 8 pieces of sushi, 4 pieces of sashimi, a turtle soup, a \"risotto\", a wonderful arrangement of small bites they billed as a petit plats. They put tamari on anything they felt needed it beforehand and only the sashimi was served with wasabi. There were so many flavours already in each piece of sushi several of which were fermented or served with shiso or other small garnishes meant to compliment the fish. They did give us a menu with the omakase order for the night and for the last course which was sushi you could pick toro or wagyu.  They did not end the meal with a Mizumono, a seasonal dessert so we ordered the chestnut ice cream that came with chestnut chantilly creme and bits of waffle cones. It wasn't too sweet and nice way to end the meal. The meal start with a kelp tea. We ordered additional buckwheat tea.\n\nBeside the sushi that came with the omakase we also ordered the Sakurani, 8.5, Tea braised Hokkaido octopus and Shimaaji, 8.5, Stripe jack with sweet daikon radish. We didn't get them because we were still hungry just because we were greedy and wanted to try them. Like most authentic places the sushi is by the single piece.\n\nBeside the spectacular quality of the fish, the highlights was the petit plats particular the Shirako with moutain yam and the uni egg with black truffle. The egg was only one bite and the Shirako dish was only two bites but they were perfect in terms of flavour, texture and presentation. I also really enjoy the turle soup which was the Futamono with rice ball filled with turtle meat in a broth. \n\nThe Gohan or rice course was underwelming with a very small amount of uni. The cherry wood smoked sushi was also a bit too heavy on the smoked flavour.\n\nThe chef who served us was Chinese while the owner and head chef is Japanese. The coursing is traditional with a blend of warm and cold dishes.

I could of drank an entire tea kettle of this because it was that good.\n\nAt first I was disappointed with their small fish selection but after giving it some thought, Chef Kusakabe's prep is truly unique and unlike anything I've ever had. For example, the striped jack was infused with just enough smoke to give it a deliciously smoky flavor without ruining the integrity of the fish. I'm not one for deep fried sushi but the crispy sesame oyster sushi was genius. It was encapsulated with a carblicious, deep fried crispy sesame and shari exterior while the oyster maintained its raw state. \n\nOther favorites were the chutoro and otoro, both of which that were luxuriously fatty. Can't forget about the A5 wagyu which was torched just enough to start melting some of the intense marbling. It was like beef buttah but Akiko's ridiculous prep with truffle oil and shaved black truffle will always be my favorite.\n\nI saw ankimo (off the menu) being cut and I had to get my foie gras of the sea fix. It was good but doesn't hold a candle to Ino's. \n\nMy least favorite nigiri was the tamago. It had a nice sweetness to it but totally lacked any soft fluffiness. Nothing beats Tani's tamago.

The omakase dinner is a slow paced meal so expect to be here for at least 2 hours. \n\nMetered street parking was easily found before 6 pm. The nearest garage is 2 blocks away at the Embarcadero Garage ($3/hour after 5 pm). \n\nAll in all, a pretty solid grand opening day but I would like to see a larger and more exotic fish selection in order for it to be solid 5 star experience. \n\nBack to that \"I pay, he puts out\".

I have few other meals to use for comparison, but Kusakabe's simplistic omakase offering leaves your experience entirely up to the chef, who has crafted the menu based on seasonality and quality of ingredients. Each guest must first complete the $95 omakase menu, and then there is the choice to order more dishes a la carte. My boyfriend and I came for his birthday dinner and were seated at the sushi bar for the full experience. \n\nThe first course was a kelp tea, which reminded me of a light seaweed soup. The light umami flavors were the perfect way to cleanse your palate for the meal to come. The next course was a sushi prelude, which included four different cuts of nigiri based on both the chef's choice and your personal preferences. Each piece is served individually, with both wasabi and soy sauce painted and melded into the nigiri for a complete bite. My favorite of the prelude was the seared fatty tuna, which had the delicious charcoal flavor of the sear paired with the rich buttery flavor of the fish. The next course was sashimi in ice, which featured fresh raw scallops and tuna. The presentation was beautiful, and I was extremely surprised at how fresh the scallop was. The soup course was next, which was an umami broth with a crab and tofu cake. I could drink bowls and bowls of this soup- the flavor was amazing and the fresh pieces of crab added a nice brininess to the bowl. The hassan course followed, and this was by far my favorite. The long platter featured five small bites- cucumber and ice fish, tomago and unagi, fresh oyster, tuna nigiri, and then a crispy soft shell crab fried with rice crackers on the outside. The crab was the best, with the rice cracker breading adding an extra element of flavor to the typical fried crunch. Next, the hot course was a miso glazed halibut on top of a garbanzo bean puree. This dish was somehow the heartiest of the night, despite the fact that the halibut was extremely delicate and flakey. The sushi finale then follows, with another three pieces of nigiri. My favorite here was the cherry salmon, a particularly fragrant and bright salmon with a slightly sweet flavor. For the final course, you're given a choice of the wagyu beef or otoro. I went with the otoro, which was the perfect last bite and testament to the quality of the ingredients and food that Kusakabe puts out. \n\nMy boyfriend was given a free birthday dessert, which was a shiso sorbet. The clean flavors of the shiso left our palates light at the end of the meal, and I couldn't have asked for a better dessert.

My husband saw this on the menu and he said \"get one yourself\" you are not having any of mine. I am glad we did cus there is no way we would split that!\n\nFirst 3 pieces of nigiri: chef choice: bonito, seared zuke chutoro cured in soy, halibut with marinated kelp and umami. Every piece hit a new flavor profile that the hubby and I had never experienced! The combinations between searing, curing, and bits of flavor added to each fish was like a symphony all working in motion resulting like a party in my mouth. My fav was the chutoro. #WOW\n\nHot bite: Wagyu & matsutake croquette with hokkaido kobu dashi and yoshino kuzu starch. Sitting at the bar the entire night, we kept seeing one of the sous chefs taking a large ladle and pouring this rich broth into something. We found out that was the thick delcious dashi broth he was pouring around the hotly fried croquette.\nThis piece was my favorite, crunchy, soupy, satisfying for my soul. The matsutake really hit the spot with the flavor and all of my taste buds were jumping for joy. I could eat this for days.\n \nsashimi: Hokkaido scallop, hokkaido wild yellowtail sashimi, came presented beautifully on a bed of ice with some leaf shavings of some kind- i forgot what they were but generally I dont eat scallop and it was delish. Fish was super fresh.  At the beginning of the meal the server asked us what kind of fish we liked and we said uni and yellowtail. I suspect she relayed this to the chef and it later appeared in one of our courses....the uni! hooray!\n\n3 pieces of nigiri part 2: alaskan wild salmon with oboro konbu and dill, hokkadio short spine uni with ikura, and hokkaido wild yellowtail nigiri. Everything was so so good, each piece of nigiri flavored to the maximum and paired with the right accompainments.\n\njapanese tapas- shigoku oyster with french caviar, red crab sushi, lobster and shrimp small bite, and otoro sushi bite, + Shirako, aka japanese salmon sperm!\nFinisher was otoro- good but somewhat chewy not 100% buttery\n\n\noverall everything was executed very well, from the service to presentation to each course and bite...were of the uptmost fresh...and the flavors of the nirigi sushi bites completely blew my mind...or as the hubby said it \" made me think about the flavors\"....which never happens!\n\nFor every course of the menu, they really pulled out all the stops to provide top notch, high end seafood ingrediants. No \"BS\" tomato courses observed when we went. Maybe Chef saw the reviews and upped his game so he can score another michelin rated star??\n\nSomeone at japanese places they will skimp on some courses and giveyou \"filler\" stuff, but not at kusakabe...everything was really top notch, did I say top quality already??\n\n$240 out the door for 2 with omakase and 1 asahi reserve.

No need to pull your hair out, it's as prix fixe menu (Omakase); well thought and planned out for you (so thoughtful that they have a little wet cloth for you to wipe your fingers).

Did Jiro (from the movie, Jiro, Sushi of Dreams) influence more and more restaurants to do Omakase?  I don't know but it does seem that there are more and more Japanese restaurants that only do Omakase or offer it.  \n\nHaving read about the new Japanese restaurants and in particular quality Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, my wife and I chose Kusakabe because the price seems to be the most reasonable (Omakase wise at least) and we know of the chef's pedigree (Sushi Ran).  The restaurant which is situated right across from Transamerica building offers mostly counter seating and I would recommend counter seating as the chef will drop off sushi piece by piece to you.  It has a very clean feel(good since it's sushi) that has a LA vibe(lounge music going on in the background with intimate lighting).\n\nTo start off with they offer you a piece of toro and man was it beautifully put together.  Then it was followed by a couple pieces of sushi.  What did I have?  I can't remember but the key here is to offer you piece by piece so you enjoy it by itself.  And no, you there's no soy sauce given, they flavor the sushi themselves meaning they may sear it, they may add a bit of soy, they may add shiso leaf or a piece of liver to enhance the flavor but only one dish, our sashimi course which was really fresh came with mirin.  All the nigiri were delicious and fresh.  There was one course which came with five bites which included an oyster with caviar and yuzu, egg white with eel, and crab meat with rice.  The course was beautifully presented and had lot of unique flavors.\n\nAlright now the hot food I thought was a bit lacking.  The duck meatball miso soup.  The duck meatballs were pretty average.  There was another fried wagyu meatball and I couldn't taste any wagyu beef in there so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nService was pretty good although the counter is kind of tight and hard for the server to get in and out to clear your plates.  I appreciate the tiny towel they gave for our fingers (keeping it clean to pick the sushi up).  It was also my wife's birthday and when we ordered dessert, they remembered and brought out the candle and sang happy birthday which was nice.\n\nFor $95, the type of food, the quality of food and the service is a good deal however if you're a big eater you won't be full.  You will need to order a la carte and that's where it can get even more expensive.  For example uni (regular one) is $8.50 for one piece and toro is $12 for one piece.  If you order a few more pieces, that can easily add up.  I would also like to see more explanation into some of the food such as the five bites, it would have been more interesting if they said eat this first, this second, third, fourth and fifth to really enhance the flavors and etc.  \n\nOverall my wife and I both liked the place and I would say it's better than Sushi Ran.

Masa (450$ per person for omakase-+150$pp for kobe supplement), is highly regarded as the best quality sushi and sushi experience in America. \nI have dined at Kusakabe 6 times now and I will continue to frequent this spot. Kusakabe is on the same level as Masa. Kusakabe blows all other SF sushi restaurants out of the water, including Akiko's and Maruya, by far. The experience that dining at Kusakabe delivers far surpasses all sushi experiences that I have had in the US, other than Masa, which is just as good. I will go as far as to say that Kusakabe is the French Laundry of Sushi.\n\nAfter returning from Japan, I have had a difficult time soothing my crave for the love of good sushi. In the Bay Area, it's almost appalling that we don't have great sushi bars, considering the large Japanese population. I had temporarily eased my fix at Sakae Sushi in San Mateo, but after discovering Kusakabe I can finally sleep peacefully at night knowing that quality sushi as great tasting and painstakingly prepared as I found in Japan, can also be found right here in San Francisco. It really is a dream come true, if you are a fellow sushi-lover and self-proclaimed sushi connoisseur, you will surely understand. \n\nThings that you need to understand before you dine here:\n1. True Kaiseki style (Omakase) means that the chef's have prepared a menu for the day, depending on availability of product, and season of fish/food. Adjustments are made accordingly to individual diners tastes. You will be asked at the start of the meal, \"What is your favorite sushi?\" \n2.The menu differs from day to day, week to week, depending upon availability. You will trust in the sushi chef(either  Mitsunori Kusakabe or Ken Ngai) to deliver a mind-blowing, taste-bud tingling experience to your body & soul for 95$ per person. \n3.After you have enjoyed the set number of courses (about 10 filling courses), you may order nigiri/sashimi or hand rolls from the a la carte menu.\n4. Do not come here without a reservation, you won't be seated. Reservations are booked weeks in advance so I recommend scheduling them far apart and many in between. \n5. This is not solely sushi, course items include a choice of soup( summer truffle, or duck dumpling, both miso based), wagyu beef, konbu cha (which is meant to be a palate cleanser ), as well as a small plate that varies with each visit. \n6. Please note that a true omakase takes time, as each piece of sushi is delicately prepared to perfection in front of your eyes. Expect to dine for 2-3 hours and enjoy every minute of the experience.\n\nAt just 95$ per person, some may see this as a deal, others as a special occasion splurge , either way, regardless of your budget,  you are truly getting the finest fish and quality ingredients in the world at Kusakabe. You will leave feeling warm, fuzzy, satisfied and enlightened. \n\nI am an Uni fiend, so I love to try all of the uni types available on the a la carte menu. My favorite is the Bafun Uni, if you love uni, you will respect the way it is prepared at Kusakabe. \nI am hooked on the summer truffle miso soup, which I expect will soon disappear as we move on to winter truffle season. I am highly anticipated any new supplements to the menu as I know they will be just as delicious.\nI prefer the wagyu beef over the toro option at the end of the meal, but it's personal preference as both are wonderfully prepared. I love and seek out the highest quality beef in the world.\nAll of the desserts are great, my favorite is the yuzu sorbet as it is so light and refreshing, yet packed with flavor.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of Kusakabe as an establishment is the impeccable regard for simplicity of design, which is, to me, the most challenging aspect of cuisine to master. Everything, down to the sushi bar itself, which is made from a singular piece of soft, bleached Japanese wood called hinoki, is meticulously thought out and strategically placed.\n\nI can only describe my experiences at Kusakabe as divine and addicting. I would recommend Kusakabe to all people with an open mind and appreciation for artistic cuisine and world-class food.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["The final item on the menu was the Toro or Wagyu.

Sashimi: the maguro and barracuda were meant to be dipped with either house grated onion with yuzu, chive, and salt or traditional soy sauce + wasabi\n  - Thinly sliced salmon wrapped around cucumber with a bamboo charcoal miso: the miso was very unique \n  - Red snapper: wrapped with ankimo, topped with Italian summer truffle and sitting on a ponzu truffle gelee.

Hassun: this was a beautifully arranged platter with lots of flavors and textures\n  - Oyster with caviar\n  - Tempura crab: coated in rice crackers\n  - Shrimp cake with sweet corn: best eaten warm; good with dipping salt \n  - Nasu agedashi: served in a little glass bowl with kani and ikura; this dish is very light\n  - Squid: very thinly sliced, with baby kiwi, toasted pine nuts, and wakame. The wakame was my favorite part of the dish\n  - Box sushi: tuna topped with bonito flakes\n  - Box sushi: tamago with a layer of crab underneath, topped with a goji berry \n  - Fried fish with red onion and a vinegar dashi\n\n5. Soup: Puree of cauliflower, which was very rich tasting. It came with a sweet potato paste in the center for more sweetness and thickness, abalone, trumpet mushrooms, abalone mushrooms\n\n6. Sushi Chic and Sushi Finale \n  - Shima aji: topped with daikon and yuzu\n  - Arctic char: with sea salt and yuzu \n  - Sanma: with grated ginger lime zest, and chives\n  - Uni, but I opted for non uni, and it was a torched oily snapper cured in kombu, which was really good \n  - Shirayaki: BBQ white eel, finished with a light drizzle of sauce and sansho pepper. I like that the sauce doesn't obscure the fish\n  - Wagyu (you could also choose toro): A5, super smooth and buttery\n\nExtras: prices range from $6-15 per piece (tamago vs uni)\n  - Jin kinmedai: golden eye snapper smoked in cherry wood\n  - Kisu: whiting cured with bonito and konbu\n\nWe were too full for dessert by the end.

When they seated us, they sat us at the bar! I love sitting at the bar because that's where you get to watch all the action.  My chef's name was Patrick and he was a great host and chef the whole evening.  The way this place works, is that you are supposed to use your hands to eat the sushi.  There will be some dishes that will require chopsticks.\n\nTo start off the night, we got the sake flight.  It's 3 different types of sake- Junmai, Ginjo, and Daiginjo.  The Junami sake we got was the Heart and soul- this was my 2nd favorite of the three.  The Ginjo sake was the Flying dragon- this was my least favorite.   The Daiginjo sake was the Sophisticated Mind- this was my favorite and by far the strongest among the three.  \n\nAnd now the begin the 7 course menu\n\nThe ichiban Dashi was like soup.  This soup had a very refreshing taste to it. \n\nSushi Prelude- Zuke Chutoro and halibut was fresh and sweet.  The smoked tuna was ok, but i'm biased, i never liked anything smoked\n\nSashimi-Also fresh and felt like it melted in your mouth\n\nHassan- 6 kinds of chef's assorted les petit.  This dish included a clam in a creamy corn sauce, which i loved.   The soft shell crab was really good.  The beef tartar was on a rice cracker which made it the perfect combo.  Jellyfish and the asparagus with shrimp was my least favorite because i normally don't like jellyfish and asparagus.  The oyster was sweet and super fresh.  There was no particular way to eat this, so i did it from least to favorite.  Save the best for last right?\n\nSoup- This fish soup was sweet and you can tell the spent time making this to get it to have this flavor, because i know that fish soup isn't easy to make.  A bonus to this soup is that it came with noodles. \n\nSeasonal Sushi- Yellowtail- really good,  Mackerel with egg yolk - this one was my favorite.  I love egg, so i loved how this was topped with egg yolk.  The first fish was a fish from a salmon family- this was ok, but it was really hard to top the Mackerel one! \n\nFinale- Scallop with Santa barbara Uni-  This one was tasty.  The scallop was so fresh along with the uni.  \n\nA la Carte-  Bafun Uni- This was like a party in your mouth.  Yes, it did give you the melt in your mouth taste and i wished i had more. I wanted more, but i was starting to get full\n\nWagyu-  This was good, but i think i liked the uni more. \n\nFor dessert I got the Cream Brulee- by far the best creme brulee i've ever had. It was perfect and not too sweet. \n\nYuzu sorbet-  this was very refreshing and perfect if you're a yuzu lover.  \n\nThe service was great and attentive.

It provides multiple complex flavors with each bite. It's made to please everyone and it's quite different than Omakase's edomae style, for example. It's very San Francisco's and it incorporates things like avocado. That being said it still keeps the tradition of sushi and respectfully modernizes it and elevates the flavor profiles.

Ask them about why they are there and how hard they had to work to get where they are.

Online reservation is very convenient, unlike some other restaurants calling them is the only way to make reservation. We were very excited for this meal because it was both of our first time having omakase. Seeing all the great reviews and mouthwatering photos of the sushi gave us really high expectation for this place. We were 30 minutes early(we though there would be traffic but there was none) but was seated promptly. We were given three menus: omakase/petite omakase menu, sake/wine pairing menu, regular sake/wine menu. The server didn't tell us there was an a la carte menu but I heard the server at the next table told his customers and explained the difference between the two omakase menu. I wanted to do the petite omakase and ordered from a la carte menu afterwards, but my boyfriend wanted to try the full omakase. It was his birthday so I let him pick whatever. We didn't do the pairing because we tried wine pairing at another restaurant on my birthday and I was buzzed half way through and couldn't enjoy the rest of the meal. However we did ordered an 8oz sake to drink slowly throughout the course. The first half of the menu was AMAZING. The fish were very fresh and flavorful. The second half of the menu was not as amazing as the first half. Maybe because I was getting full since I ate a lot in the morning. I should have thought it through. For the last 4-5 courses I was shoveling food down my throat without really spent time tasting them in my mouth. I was so full I had to give a few pieces of my sushi to my boyfriend. I am sure the sushi courses would taste a lot better if I had the appetite. However I didn't really enjoy the petit plates and the wagyu tongue stew no matter if I was full or not. Reading the reviews I know most people love these two courses, but maybe I have a different palate. I liked the fish a lot more. Honestly I don't think we would have missed out if we had picked the petite omakase. Frankly speaking Im not being entirely fair to the restaurant since I got full half way. So I asked my boyfriend if he enjoyed it and he said not really. The only thing he liked was the uni.

However, it was disappointing to find out\u00a0party of two or more were not able to sit by the sushi bar and we had 4 people. I feel like that is part of the experience if I was to dish out $200 bucks for a meal.\u00a0\n\nWe were seated promptly by our reservation time at 8:15 and we chose the Grand Omakase\u00a0because of the delicacy menu options (Truffle, A5 Wagyu beef, Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Eel from Tsukiji Market and Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly). An important thing to point out is we were NEVER served the Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly like the menu stated. Instead we were served Negitoro, which is minced fatty tuna with micro onion on a roasted seaweed. Those are two very different things, I wanted to ask why we were served the negitoro instead of the fatty tuna belly, but since my friends didn't mention I didn't want to be particular. Now that I think about it, I am quite angry that the manager didn't mention anything at all about switching our menu.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, a review on the food that we DID have. It was a 10 course menu (with 2 soups) and it was more than enough. A tip for everyone, if you want to do a la carte towards the end, I suggest you choose the regular Omakase with less courses. Actually with the Grand Omakase, there is a course with non-sashimi/sushi dish. So if you here for the sushi/sashimi definitely choose the regular Omakase then do a la carte at the end.\u00a0\n\nOne thing to note about the sushi here is that they seasoned all their rice. At first it looked like brown rice, then we realized every piece of rice has soy sauce seasoned so the flavor is even throughout. My favorite sushi\u00a0would definitely be the Oshinogi with Scallop+Uni sushi,\u00a0Nata with poached egg on spoon, the uni sushi and surprisingly the Shima Aji (stripe jack) which is the chef's choice of sushi. The Hassun which included 6 small plates was also very tasty, I love how the food is like art. The wagyu beef tartare was one of the most delicious tartare that I ever had.\u00a0The most disappointing course would definitely be the seared A5 Wagyu sushi, they over-seasoned it with too much pepper and salt overpowering the taste of the wagyu. It felt like they wasted a perfectly fine piece of meat, except the meat itself had a bit too much lines in it.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kusakabe for Omakase on a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. It seems like a popular date place, you can impress somebody\u00a0by bringing them here and eating in front of the sushi bar. It's a shame we didn't get to sit there to watch as the sushi chef prepare our dishes. There might have been 1 or 2 disappointment, nevertheless it was a good experience.

These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle. But my favorite dish was definitely the soft-shell crab, which was so creamy on the inside and delicately crunchy on the inside!\n\nCourse 5: Red miso soup with a duck and lotus root meatball, layered with soy cream foam. Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience! The restaurant itself is small but homey and authentic (the bathroom even features an automated Japanese toilet). The service is the epitome of Japanese hospitality and the prices are exorbitant, so make sure to come with an appreciation of the work, care, and quality that goes behind each bite of food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["uni on top.

I explained to the staff saying that my friend will be late for maybe at least 30 mins because of the traffic. And she looked unhappy. I told her that I could just sit down and order for my friend. I said the chef could just make two portion of the sushi and put my friend's portion in a plate or something. After my friend comes, he could just enjoy it. \n\nShe was like, there's \"no place\" to put the nigiri. we don't do to-go box. And then she kept suggesting me that my friend has to be here before 6 otherwise, they can't serve us. I was like.. THIS IS CRAZY. I already got here and do i have to just waste money and eat nothing? She explained to me that the second-seating guests will come at 8pm so there is no enough time for the chef to serve us if my friend comes after 6. I told her that we eat very fast. But then she pushed back again saying that even if you guys eat fast and chef can't make the food fast. It still has to depend on the chef. She even said that if my friend comes after 6, then the chef won't have enough time to serve all the food ( even if we paid the same price as others....\n\nAt the end, my friend came at around 5:50PM. And then she took us to our seats. We finished at around \"7PM\". ( i was like.. how come there won't be enough time if my friend come after 6..) Also, there's a small plate in front of everyone. But she said that there's no PLACE to put nigiri if I sit in and order for my friend first.\n\nI totally understand that she wanted us to enjoy an authentic and comfortable eating environment for omakase. But i feel the way she communicated to me is like.. \"YOU can't eat until your friend comes and you are going to just throw your money to trash can WITHOUT eating anything if your friend doesn't come before 6 even if I AM already here\" \n\nAlso,The bathroom is broken and the staff told me that she will have people take me to another bathroom. \n\nBased on the experience with the front staff, suggest people have to be arriving at exactly the time you reserve and no one in your group could be late. \nFor me, I will not come again even the food is REALLY awesome.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-01-06"}, {"excerpts": ["The ONLY reason why it may not be number 1 was because the bafun uni had a slight ammonia flavor which I couldn't get past.

Doors don't open until exactly 5:00PM. Through the curtains is a narrow hall and doorway. Upon entering, the host will ask for your reservation and you will be seated in your designated spots. The space is narrow, with not very many seats, hence the limited reservations each night and it usually doesn't get too loud. \n\nYou'll get a chance to look over their two menus: the first for omakase ($95 or $150) and the other for drinks. We opted for the $95 and some sake, of course. They started us off with some dashi broth, which was really nice on a cold, rainy evening. Then came the sushi. While there are chopsticks provided, we used our fingers for the most part. There's a bit of cloth for you to wipe your fingers on between pieces and some food items are much easier to handle with chopsticks, so there's no pressure. Each piece of sushi was so special and the taste so unique. The Zuke Toro was the most unforgettable one, so much that later on, we ordered another round a la carte. Super excited that there was some uni involved as well. Chef's assorted Les petit plats was just so pretty to look at and even better to eat.

You have one piece that was heavily flavored with soy sauce contrasting with another that was light and fresh, no frills.

I loved that you got a tiny bite of everything, rather than one entree. I won't go over everything, but wasn't blown away by the taste of the overall dish. I'm sure people who love clams would like the cold clam soup. I felt like it really brought out the flavor of the clams. I didn't particularly like it, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of clams. There was a lightly fried shrimp and taro, like shrimp and taro karage. Tasted like what you would expect. It also came with something that tasted like wagyu croquette, covered in crispy rice.

My favorites of the courses were the chu toro and copper salmon nigiri, although pretty much all the nigiri they served as part of the omakase were delicious. Each piece was specially seasoned and super fresh. I loved the turtle soup dish (can't believe I ate a cute little turtle), but  shockingly, it was amazing. The dish with two crispy fish in a truffle sauce and shishito pepper was another favorite of mine. Pretty much licked the dish clean because the truffle sauce was so tasty. I also really enjoyed the 5 piece le petit sampler plate of the chefs specials. Huge fan of the crispy eggplant and the tuna over rice piece. \n\nFor the last piece,we chose the a5 wagyu sushi. I gotta say that I was not completely blown away with this piece. I actually think that Sushi Sams in San Mateo has a better A5.

The only suggestion that I have is to be more careful and remember if people have specific food restrictions. I asked for no wasabi in all the dishes, however, we had to remind our waitress at least 3 times and there was still some wasabi in my sushi :( which took away from some of the taste for me.

Omakase stands for a meal consisting of dishes selected by the Chef. I highly recommend this because you get to taste a wide variety of fresh fish and flavors that you may not normally would order. You will likely try something that you have never tried before and be pleasantly surprised. \n\nOut of the three Omakases that I tried, Kusakabe, by far, was my favorite. (The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Highlights for me were the Uni (Hokkaido) ", "- what can I say, Uni is just the best,  the Chutoro - which I prefer over the otoro, the Shima Aji - love my white jacks, and the Alaskan King Salmon - such perfect fat content .

My fiance and I are currently trying to buy a house yet Kusakabe let us to a real discussion of whether it would be better to put our money into a mortgage or maybe just eating at Kusakabe a couple times every week. I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish. Spoiler alert: You will likely feel compelled to continue after your omakase is done, there is just so much good stuff to try!\n\nHere's an overview of our meal. Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best. Dammit. Next time.\n\nAll in all it was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go again!

He placed the sliced fish on a cherry board and used a torch to burn the surrounding wood which gave the fish a slight hint of smokiness.

My lovely BF surprised me with reservations here for our anniversary and oh my god it was such a beautiful and creative dining experience.\n\nReservations become available online 2 months in advance and for the true omakase experience you gotta sit at the sushi bar so you can watch your chef can personalize each part of the meal to your liking :) \n\nThey only serve omakase, a $150 grand set or the $95 set, with options for add-ons at the end of the meal. Feeling fancy, we opted for the grand set and if you're looking for a time to splurge, this would be it!\n\nThe omakase experience is unique to each restaurant but the creativity and care that goes into each piece is where Kusakabe really shines. Each dish was well-thought out and went beyond just the typical nigiri. Before our meal our sushi chef asked us if there was anything we didn't like or really liked. I really dislike wasabi and usually for omakase they add it to every piece of sushi. However our chef made sure to only put a small amount for all my pieces and I couldn't even taste it!\n\nI believe the menu changes seasonally, but here's what we had:\n- Ichiban Dashi - first up was soup, like a fancier version of miso soup, probably the best soup I've had using dashi broth!\n- Sushi prelude - next we were served 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, one was the king of all sushi - the toro tuna! So soft and buttery, each and every piece. The other 4 pieces were seasonal and the chef makes sure to tell you where each fish comes from :) I believe we had scallop from Santa Barbara!\n- Sashimi - next we were given four different types of sashimi paired with 4 different unique types of sauce/toppings. One included truffle shavings and another was mussels. The flavor combos were so good, although some I liked more than others but definitely all flavors I had never tried before.\n- Hassun - the creativity continues with a box of a random assortment of seafood in all shapes and forms. But presentation on point for errything. Honestly some weren't that tasty (there was a weird seafood cracker that I didn't like) but again, just so unique and such detailed preparation.\n- Soup - this was a creamy cauliflower soup with abalone and abalone mushrooms. Tasted like a lighter version of clam chowder but seriously soo delicious!\n- Sushi Chic - more nigiri sushi including uni (sea urchin) from Santa Barbara! I'm not a big uni fan but oh boy this one was so buttery and creamy and slightly sweet. Definitely can taste the quality and freshness!\n- Sushi Finale - ended with Unagi (BBQ eel) and a choice of toro or wagyu beef. I'd recommend the wagyu beef since it is so tender and they sear it right in front of you with a touch of pepper. It just melted in my mouth like butter.

Several nigiri and kitchen items were overpowered by some component of the dish, whether it be too much cucumber rolled within trout, too much acid (lemon) on the oyster,  or beans that dominated the crab salad.  We just want the fish to shine.\n\nOn the plus side, Kusakabe's rice was well cooked and seasoned.  We liked that, proportionally, the balance of fish to rice was just right.  Wako, on the other hand, served too much rice and it was not as well flavored.

Not only did I note on the reservation, but also called & left a voicemail to confirm that this was a birthday celebration. Sadly, there was no mention or even the slightest acknowledgement of my requests. Call me naive, but I was hoping/ expecting better service at a Michelin star restaurant- $400 meal.\n \nAny ways, whomp whomp- at $95 per person, you'll get an omakase (set prix fix menu). No doubt, it's some of the freshest sushi I've had in SF. However, there were also items I didn't thoroughly enjoy, such as the kelp tea (known to help cleanse palate- left a weird after taste) and the soup (which I found rather on the saltier end). \nAs for the grand finale of the omakase, I'd highly recommend the A5 wagyu beef nigiri, from the texture to taste, it was utterly orgasmic (this means a lot coming from a person who doesn't even like beef).\nFor the uni lovers, one MUST try the Kaisui uni (14.50 a piece- hokkaido sea urchin) and Bafun Uni (13 a piece, Hokkaido short spine sea urchin).

I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Then theres the Uni and the BBQ eel, which were both way better than I expected.

The $150 option comes with the grade A5 Wagyu beef, which is probably the best piece of meat I've ever eaten. \nSince everything is amazing and there are way too many pieces of sushi, I'll highlight the best ones.\nThere are about 22 items total in the $150 menu. \n-The lightly seared bluefin was amazing. Explosive start to the meal. Then it's 4 pieces of sushi followed by a small plate of sashimi. All sooo delicious.\n-Then its a plate of assorted pieces such as an oyster with French Daurenki caviar, a Hako-Zushi and some delicately made finger foods. \n-Next dish is a Hamaguri soup with bamboo shoots and mushrooms. The soup was pretty good but there was some broken shell in the clam.\n-The next 5 pieces are different types of sushi. Our chef asked us if we have any favorite fish. I said hamachi and my gf said salmon. So the chef made us exactly those and it was amazing. Then theres the Uni and the BBQ eel, which were both way better than I expected. The Uni was so fresh and the eel was cooked to perfection.\n-The finale: The A5 grade wagyu beef and the bluefin fatty tuna.

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me.

He does all the cutting of the sashimi, and there would be assistants on each side of him that makes the nigiri rice.

That one meal experience changed everything. Now on to Nori San. He is an expert sushi chef that I would say has mastered his craft, as well. And it was by chance and an absolute pleasure to be sitting at the bar, right in front of him, and being personally served by a master. It was like having front row seats to watching the master in action. \n\nThe whole meal was traditional in some sense (i.e. rice portion, rice temperature, no personal soy sauce), but non traditional in other ways that work. They offer only one choice -- $95 omakase dinner which is explores kaiseki principals to create a multi-course sushi menu. It was fascinating to watch him meticulously slice each fish and assemble it. Of course we ate everything that was offered on the menu, even getting both options where there were options. The finale for example, we were offered a choice between toro (bluefin fatty tuna) or grade A wagyu. I couldn't choose so I had both! The a la carte sushi menu was provided after our meal, and we ordered more than we had planned, but no regrets. The sushi here ranged from $8 - $15 each. The highlights were definitely the following and I recommend ordering the below four: \n\n- Uni (Mendocino sea urchin)\n- Bafun Uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin from Japan)\n- Shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel)\n- Hamo (Kyoto pike eel tempura style) -- MUST TRY!\n\nTo finish off dinner, there were three options for dessert and of course we said we'll take all three, please. The yuzu sorbet, tofu ice cream and the matcha tea creme brulee were all more than amazing. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nWe had dinner here two weeks ago and Chef Nori said he had only been opened for two months.

The quality of fish is probably some the best in SF, the preparations are more creative than at Omakase or Maruya, the two other high end kaiseki style places in SF. The atmosphere is more relaxed than at Omakase and the technique probably better than the current chefs at Maruya. The sushi is prepared in other styles than the Edomae with lots of marinating, layering of flavours and even wood smoked. \n\nTL:DR If you want to experience sushi and sashimi beyond rolls and at the highest level of skill and quality of fish this is probably one of the two best places in SF (Omakase being the other place). If you think rolls with avocado and huge slabs of brightly coloured fish is sushi you will be probably not like this place and whine on yelp about small pieces and other stupid comments that show your ignorance.\n\nAll the deets:\nPrice-one set price of 95 not including drinks or tip. \nTwo seatings at 5pm or 8pm-if you show up a bit early for the 8pm they can seat you if there is a space free. Always sit at the bar. There are four tables but you loss the interaction with the chefs and getting to watch them work. The focus is mostly on the sushi and sashimi so although it's coursed and plated like kaiseki there aren't all the courses and dishes you would find in a full kaiseki meal in Japan.\n\nAs part of the omakase we had 8 pieces of sushi, 4 pieces of sashimi, a turtle soup, a \"risotto\", a wonderful arrangement of small bites they billed as a petit plats. They put tamari on anything they felt needed it beforehand and only the sashimi was served with wasabi. There were so many flavours already in each piece of sushi several of which were fermented or served with shiso or other small garnishes meant to compliment the fish. They did give us a menu with the omakase order for the night and for the last course which was sushi you could pick toro or wagyu.  They did not end the meal with a Mizumono, a seasonal dessert so we ordered the chestnut ice cream that came with chestnut chantilly creme and bits of waffle cones. It wasn't too sweet and nice way to end the meal. The meal start with a kelp tea. We ordered additional buckwheat tea.\n\nBeside the sushi that came with the omakase we also ordered the Sakurani, 8.5, Tea braised Hokkaido octopus and Shimaaji, 8.5, Stripe jack with sweet daikon radish. We didn't get them because we were still hungry just because we were greedy and wanted to try them. Like most authentic places the sushi is by the single piece.\n\nBeside the spectacular quality of the fish, the highlights was the petit plats particular the Shirako with moutain yam and the uni egg with black truffle. The egg was only one bite and the Shirako dish was only two bites but they were perfect in terms of flavour, texture and presentation. I also really enjoy the turle soup which was the Futamono with rice ball filled with turtle meat in a broth. \n\nThe Gohan or rice course was underwelming with a very small amount of uni. The cherry wood smoked sushi was also a bit too heavy on the smoked flavour.\n\nThe chef who served us was Chinese while the owner and head chef is Japanese. The coursing is traditional with a blend of warm and cold dishes. The service both the chefs and other wait staff was friendlier than at Omakase or Maruya.\n\nThe space is small but fully wheelchair accessible including the bathroom.

The attention to detail was impeccable. \n\nWe were seated by the sushi bar for optimum viewing pleasure and ordered the omakase along with a bottle of sauvignon blanc to share (paired perfectly with all of the raw fish).

Each bite of nigiri was delicate and nuanced in flavor. The thick slices of sashimi were fresh and melted in your mouth. There is also a very harmonious transition between the cold and warm dishes.

Quality: while i am not expert by any means for fish, i know that i shouldnt be getting sinewy pieces in my wagyu and my toro.  The taste of the wagyu was good unless all i was left with was the sinew.  Very delicious taste. \n5. Menu size: the course was a little smaller than i expected, granted they tried to pack variety into the meal.  1 dish would consist of a single soup but then it would be followed by a medley of fish, from egg yolk with wagyu peices, small oyster with caviar, baby eel, etc. this would be followed by the a la carte menu with sushi prices going from 8.50 to 14.50 with uni being the 14.50 option. \n\ntl;dr: 2/5 because of quality of food, ambiance, and because (partly my own fault) of my expectations of the Michellin star.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-02-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered Hokkaido uni from the ala carte menu and it was delicious!

Each one is a delicate work of handcrafted perfection, with a variety of subtle flavors that merit paused appreciation and wonder.  Then, as the omakase winds toward a grand finale of your choice (either bluefin toro or wagyu beef) a nigiri menu is brought forth and other individual delicacies become available for your selection.  These include thee different kinds of uni: an outstandingly smooth one from Santa Barbara (where more than half the world's uni originates), a deliciously delicate short-spine variety from Japan, and a third deep-sea variety which I reserved in eager anticipation for my next visit.\n\nChef Kusakabe stands behind the sushi bar personally crafting each piece with the assistance of five other chefs.

But, the bowl was really shallow and you can't tell by looking at it.  I did not like the crispy rice cracker tofu.  It was oily.

Did Jiro (from the movie, Jiro, Sushi of Dreams) influence more and more restaurants to do Omakase?  I don't know but it does seem that there are more and more Japanese restaurants that only do Omakase or offer it.  \n\nHaving read about the new Japanese restaurants and in particular quality Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, my wife and I chose Kusakabe because the price seems to be the most reasonable (Omakase wise at least) and we know of the chef's pedigree (Sushi Ran).  The restaurant which is situated right across from Transamerica building offers mostly counter seating and I would recommend counter seating as the chef will drop off sushi piece by piece to you.  It has a very clean feel(good since it's sushi) that has a LA vibe(lounge music going on in the background with intimate lighting).\n\nTo start off with they offer you a piece of toro and man was it beautifully put together.  Then it was followed by a couple pieces of sushi.  What did I have?  I can't remember but the key here is to offer you piece by piece so you enjoy it by itself.  And no, you there's no soy sauce given, they flavor the sushi themselves meaning they may sear it, they may add a bit of soy, they may add shiso leaf or a piece of liver to enhance the flavor but only one dish, our sashimi course which was really fresh came with mirin.  All the nigiri were delicious and fresh.  There was one course which came with five bites which included an oyster with caviar and yuzu, egg white with eel, and crab meat with rice.  The course was beautifully presented and had lot of unique flavors.\n\nAlright now the hot food I thought was a bit lacking.  The duck meatball miso soup.  The duck meatballs were pretty average.  There was another fried wagyu meatball and I couldn't taste any wagyu beef in there so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nService was pretty good although the counter is kind of tight and hard for the server to get in and out to clear your plates.  I appreciate the tiny towel they gave for our fingers (keeping it clean to pick the sushi up).  It was also my wife's birthday and when we ordered dessert, they remembered and brought out the candle and sang happy birthday which was nice.\n\nFor $95, the type of food, the quality of food and the service is a good deal however if you're a big eater you won't be full.  You will need to order a la carte and that's where it can get even more expensive.  For example uni (regular one) is $8.50 for one piece and toro is $12 for one piece.  If you order a few more pieces, that can easily add up.  I would also like to see more explanation into some of the food such as the five bites, it would have been more interesting if they said eat this first, this second, third, fourth and fifth to really enhance the flavors and etc.  \n\nOverall my wife and I both liked the place and I would say it's better than Sushi Ran.

The table setting includes a small black towel to wipe your fingers after picking up the sushi. Since the restaurant is small and customers come in in waves, it gives the wait staff the opportunity to attend all the customers throughout the night. Our glasses were instantly attended and every time I dropped a grain of rice or a drop of my drink on the table, someone would come by immediately to wipe it off.\n\nThe sushi chef, Ken was also very attentive. During the night, we met a very friendly couple who sat next to us. They came in a little after us so they were served a few items behind us on the menu.

I got the Kaisui Uni and the Ayu. The Kaisui Uni was a miniature version of the large uni you normally get. It was probably the best uni I had in the Bay Area. The ayu was also very yummy. It was a sweet and buttery burst of flavor. \n\nI came here for an anniversary so the restaurant served the Yuzu sorbet dessert with a candle which added a nice touch to the end of the night.\n\nOverall amazing experience and every bite was texture-full with a burst of flavor.

Masa (450$ per person for omakase-+150$pp for kobe supplement), is highly regarded as the best quality sushi and sushi experience in America. \nI have dined at Kusakabe 6 times now and I will continue to frequent this spot. Kusakabe is on the same level as Masa. Kusakabe blows all other SF sushi restaurants out of the water, including Akiko's and Maruya, by far. The experience that dining at Kusakabe delivers far surpasses all sushi experiences that I have had in the US, other than Masa, which is just as good. I will go as far as to say that Kusakabe is the French Laundry of Sushi.\n\nAfter returning from Japan, I have had a difficult time soothing my crave for the love of good sushi. In the Bay Area, it's almost appalling that we don't have great sushi bars, considering the large Japanese population. I had temporarily eased my fix at Sakae Sushi in San Mateo, but after discovering Kusakabe I can finally sleep peacefully at night knowing that quality sushi as great tasting and painstakingly prepared as I found in Japan, can also be found right here in San Francisco. It really is a dream come true, if you are a fellow sushi-lover and self-proclaimed sushi connoisseur, you will surely understand. \n\nThings that you need to understand before you dine here:\n1. True Kaiseki style (Omakase) means that the chef's have prepared a menu for the day, depending on availability of product, and season of fish/food. Adjustments are made accordingly to individual diners tastes. You will be asked at the start of the meal, \"What is your favorite sushi?\" \n2.The menu differs from day to day, week to week, depending upon availability. You will trust in the sushi chef(either  Mitsunori Kusakabe or Ken Ngai) to deliver a mind-blowing, taste-bud tingling experience to your body & soul for 95$ per person. \n3.After you have enjoyed the set number of courses (about 10 filling courses), you may order nigiri/sashimi or hand rolls from the a la carte menu.\n4. Do not come here without a reservation, you won't be seated. Reservations are booked weeks in advance so I recommend scheduling them far apart and many in between. \n5. This is not solely sushi, course items include a choice of soup( summer truffle, or duck dumpling, both miso based), wagyu beef, konbu cha (which is meant to be a palate cleanser ), as well as a small plate that varies with each visit. \n6. Please note that a true omakase takes time, as each piece of sushi is delicately prepared to perfection in front of your eyes. Expect to dine for 2-3 hours and enjoy every minute of the experience.\n\nAt just 95$ per person, some may see this as a deal, others as a special occasion splurge , either way, regardless of your budget,  you are truly getting the finest fish and quality ingredients in the world at Kusakabe. You will leave feeling warm, fuzzy, satisfied and enlightened. \n\nI am an Uni fiend, so I love to try all of the uni types available on the a la carte menu. My favorite is the Bafun Uni, if you love uni, you will respect the way it is prepared at Kusakabe. \nI am hooked on the summer truffle miso soup, which I expect will soon disappear as we move on to winter truffle season. I am highly anticipated any new supplements to the menu as I know they will be just as delicious.\nI prefer the wagyu beef over the toro option at the end of the meal, but it's personal preference as both are wonderfully prepared. I love and seek out the highest quality beef in the world.\nAll of the desserts are great, my favorite is the yuzu sorbet as it is so light and refreshing, yet packed with flavor.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of Kusakabe as an establishment is the impeccable regard for simplicity of design, which is, to me, the most challenging aspect of cuisine to master. Everything, down to the sushi bar itself, which is made from a singular piece of soft, bleached Japanese wood called hinoki, is meticulously thought out and strategically placed.\n\nI can only describe my experiences at Kusakabe as divine and addicting. I would recommend Kusakabe to all people with an open mind and appreciation for artistic cuisine and world-class food.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["the Hokkaido Uni is amazing.

This was my first Michelin star dining experience and I am so glad it was as it was absolutely amazing. \n\nWe started off with the Omakase courses which were 7 courses for $95pp. I wasn't a huge fan of the seaweed drink they give you to cleanse your palette. My favorites of the courses were the chu toro and copper salmon nigiri, although pretty much all the nigiri they served as part of the omakase were delicious. Each piece was specially seasoned and super fresh. I loved the turtle soup dish (can't believe I ate a cute little turtle), but  shockingly, it was amazing. The dish with two crispy fish in a truffle sauce and shishito pepper was another favorite of mine. Pretty much licked the dish clean because the truffle sauce was so tasty. I also really enjoyed the 5 piece le petit sampler plate of the chefs specials. Huge fan of the crispy eggplant and the tuna over rice piece. \n\nFor the last piece,we chose the a5 wagyu sushi. I gotta say that I was not completely blown away with this piece. I actually think that Sushi Sams in San Mateo has a better A5.

The only suggestion that I have is to be more careful and remember if people have specific food restrictions. I asked for no wasabi in all the dishes, however, we had to remind our waitress at least 3 times and there was still some wasabi in my sushi :( which took away from some of the taste for me. They made it up by giving us free dessert for our anniversary. Desserts were delicious, I would highly recommend the pancetta and I'd probably skip out on the corn ice cream next time. \n\nMake sure you make reservations months in advance if you want to sit at the bar and you can probably get in a months in advance if just for a table.

Omakase stands for a meal consisting of dishes selected by the Chef. I highly recommend this because you get to taste a wide variety of fresh fish and flavors that you may not normally would order. You will likely try something that you have never tried before and be pleasantly surprised. \n\nOut of the three Omakases that I tried, Kusakabe, by far, was my favorite. (The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-08-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Get the Kaisui uni because it's really one of the best. \n\n"], "author": "Irene C.", "review": "Don't get me wrong, the food is 5 stars.

Being an avid sushi lover, I knew he would be thrilled to be treated to one of the town's boasted Michelin star Japanese restaurant. Not only did I note on the reservation, but also called & left a voicemail to confirm that this was a birthday celebration. Sadly, there was no mention or even the slightest acknowledgement of my requests. Call me naive, but I was hoping/ expecting better service at a Michelin star restaurant- $400 meal.\n \nAny ways, whomp whomp- at $95 per person, you'll get an omakase (set prix fix menu). No doubt, it's some of the freshest sushi I've had in SF. However, there were also items I didn't thoroughly enjoy, such as the kelp tea (known to help cleanse palate- left a weird after taste) and the soup (which I found rather on the saltier end). \nAs for the grand finale of the omakase, I'd highly recommend the A5 wagyu beef nigiri, from the texture to taste, it was utterly orgasmic (this means a lot coming from a person who doesn't even like beef).\nFor the uni lovers, one MUST try the Kaisui uni (14.50 a piece- hokkaido sea urchin) and Bafun Uni (13 a piece, Hokkaido short spine sea urchin). I can honestly say that each bite was simply heavenly & worth every darn dollar. Hands down the best uni I've had in my life thus far. \n\nVerdict: avid sushi lovers should come try out this place. it's by no means a place to regularly frequent for date night, but it's totally worth a try.

HAHA- guess I'm still not over the mishap a year later).", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-21"}, {"excerpts": ["The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  "], "author": "Dan P.", "review": "THE REAL DEAL!\n\nYup, this place is the real deal.  I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the kaisui uni and ankimo.

Truthfully, the Toro was way better, in terms of texture and taste.   We also ordered the kaisui uni and ankimo. Both were creamy and rich in flavor.

We had a few a la carte nigiris afterwards and they were all great. There's 3 types of unis, the santa barbara one is the one you can get everywhere. Try the kaisui uni! It's so good and the texture is like butter.\n\nOn the omakase, for the 4th and 8th course, you can choose between: duck miso soup or black truffle soup. I think the black truffle soup is a lot better and tastier! (I love black truffles!). You also have to choose between toro at the end of wagyu A5. You can get either one again on the a la carte menu after the tasting, but go with the toro if you order nothing else! It's just so good!!\n\nMy other favorite sushi places in the city are Akiko's, Ichi, Maruya, Daigo, Pabu and Umi. Kusakabe, is definitely on or above par from all of the sushi places in SF.

I feel the sushi had too many accoutrements on them.  A dash of this and a sprinkle of that.  Some were overpowering the taste of the fish.  The duck dumpling miso soup was good.  But, the bowl was really shallow and you can't tell by looking at it.  I did not like the crispy rice cracker tofu.  It was oily.

Being an indecisive person who can never choose something off a menu, this was the perfect place. I have a very keen tongue for unfresh fish, but I can say this place serves pretty fresh fish.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing.

You go for the chef-led omakase and are presented with course after course of beautifully-formed, high-quality dishes that take your palate on a little tour of Japanese flavors and techniques. The dining room is small and reservations are required, but I got to come with a group of seven friends, and it was a great experience trying and discussing all the different courses together. This is not your typical, run-of-the-mill sushi, so be prepared to splurge (the base menu comes at a hefty $98/head), and come with an appreciation for the quality and cost of purveyance of the ingredients. \n\nCourse #1: a subtly-flavored dashi broth. Nothing unusual (after all, there are only three ingredients in this fish-based broth), but very clean tasting and a nice way to start the meal.\n\nCourse #2: The zuku chutoro (bluefin medium fatty tuna) was seared on one side, giving the fish a great texture to complement its flavors. The hirame halibut with its own liver had a slightly spicy kick, and the cold-smoked bonito (katsuo) resounded with the flavors of the wood smoke.\n\nCourse #3: Bluefin sashimi and poached amberjack (a surprising favorite of mine). These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle. But my favorite dish was definitely the soft-shell crab, which was so creamy on the inside and delicately crunchy on the inside!\n\nCourse 5: Red miso soup with a duck and lotus root meatball, layered with soy cream foam. Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience! The restaurant itself is small but homey and authentic (the bathroom even features an automated Japanese toilet).

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.

Masa (450$ per person for omakase-+150$pp for kobe supplement), is highly regarded as the best quality sushi and sushi experience in America. \nI have dined at Kusakabe 6 times now and I will continue to frequent this spot. Kusakabe is on the same level as Masa. Kusakabe blows all other SF sushi restaurants out of the water, including Akiko's and Maruya, by far. The experience that dining at Kusakabe delivers far surpasses all sushi experiences that I have had in the US, other than Masa, which is just as good. I will go as far as to say that Kusakabe is the French Laundry of Sushi.\n\nAfter returning from Japan, I have had a difficult time soothing my crave for the love of good sushi. In the Bay Area, it's almost appalling that we don't have great sushi bars, considering the large Japanese population. I had temporarily eased my fix at Sakae Sushi in San Mateo, but after discovering Kusakabe I can finally sleep peacefully at night knowing that quality sushi as great tasting and painstakingly prepared as I found in Japan, can also be found right here in San Francisco. It really is a dream come true, if you are a fellow sushi-lover and self-proclaimed sushi connoisseur, you will surely understand. \n\nThings that you need to understand before you dine here:\n1. True Kaiseki style (Omakase) means that the chef's have prepared a menu for the day, depending on availability of product, and season of fish/food. Adjustments are made accordingly to individual diners tastes. You will be asked at the start of the meal, \"What is your favorite sushi?\" \n2.The menu differs from day to day, week to week, depending upon availability. You will trust in the sushi chef(either  Mitsunori Kusakabe or Ken Ngai) to deliver a mind-blowing, taste-bud tingling experience to your body & soul for 95$ per person. \n3.After you have enjoyed the set number of courses (about 10 filling courses), you may order nigiri/sashimi or hand rolls from the a la carte menu.\n4. Do not come here without a reservation, you won't be seated. Reservations are booked weeks in advance so I recommend scheduling them far apart and many in between. \n5. This is not solely sushi, course items include a choice of soup( summer truffle, or duck dumpling, both miso based), wagyu beef, konbu cha (which is meant to be a palate cleanser ), as well as a small plate that varies with each visit. \n6. Please note that a true omakase takes time, as each piece of sushi is delicately prepared to perfection in front of your eyes. Expect to dine for 2-3 hours and enjoy every minute of the experience.\n\nAt just 95$ per person, some may see this as a deal, others as a special occasion splurge , either way, regardless of your budget,  you are truly getting the finest fish and quality ingredients in the world at Kusakabe. You will leave feeling warm, fuzzy, satisfied and enlightened. \n\nI am an Uni fiend, so I love to try all of the uni types available on the a la carte menu. My favorite is the Bafun Uni, if you love uni, you will respect the way it is prepared at Kusakabe. \nI am hooked on the summer truffle miso soup, which I expect will soon disappear as we move on to winter truffle season. I am highly anticipated any new supplements to the menu as I know they will be just as delicious.\nI prefer the wagyu beef over the toro option at the end of the meal, but it's personal preference as both are wonderfully prepared. I love and seek out the highest quality beef in the world.\nAll of the desserts are great, my favorite is the yuzu sorbet as it is so light and refreshing, yet packed with flavor.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of Kusakabe as an establishment is the impeccable regard for simplicity of design, which is, to me, the most challenging aspect of cuisine to master. Everything, down to the sushi bar itself, which is made from a singular piece of soft, bleached Japanese wood called hinoki, is meticulously thought out and strategically placed.\n\nI can only describe my experiences at Kusakabe as divine and addicting.

The quality of fish is probably some the best in SF, the preparations are more creative than at Omakase or Maruya, the two other high end kaiseki style places in SF. The atmosphere is more relaxed than at Omakase and the technique probably better than the current chefs at Maruya. The sushi is prepared in other styles than the Edomae with lots of marinating, layering of flavours and even wood smoked. \n\nTL:DR If you want to experience sushi and sashimi beyond rolls and at the highest level of skill and quality of fish this is probably one of the two best places in SF (Omakase being the other place). If you think rolls with avocado and huge slabs of brightly coloured fish is sushi you will be probably not like this place and whine on yelp about small pieces and other stupid comments that show your ignorance.\n\nAll the deets:\nPrice-one set price of 95 not including drinks or tip. \nTwo seatings at 5pm or 8pm-if you show up a bit early for the 8pm they can seat you if there is a space free. Always sit at the bar. There are four tables but you loss the interaction with the chefs and getting to watch them work. The focus is mostly on the sushi and sashimi so although it's coursed and plated like kaiseki there aren't all the courses and dishes you would find in a full kaiseki meal in Japan.\n\nAs part of the omakase we had 8 pieces of sushi, 4 pieces of sashimi, a turtle soup, a \"risotto\", a wonderful arrangement of small bites they billed as a petit plats. They put tamari on anything they felt needed it beforehand and only the sashimi was served with wasabi. There were so many flavours already in each piece of sushi several of which were fermented or served with shiso or other small garnishes meant to compliment the fish. They did give us a menu with the omakase order for the night and for the last course which was sushi you could pick toro or wagyu.  They did not end the meal with a Mizumono, a seasonal dessert so we ordered the chestnut ice cream that came with chestnut chantilly creme and bits of waffle cones. It wasn't too sweet and nice way to end the meal. The meal start with a kelp tea. We ordered additional buckwheat tea.\n\nBeside the sushi that came with the omakase we also ordered the Sakurani, 8.5, Tea braised Hokkaido octopus and Shimaaji, 8.5, Stripe jack with sweet daikon radish. We didn't get them because we were still hungry just because we were greedy and wanted to try them. Like most authentic places the sushi is by the single piece.\n\nBeside the spectacular quality of the fish, the highlights was the petit plats particular the Shirako with moutain yam and the uni egg with black truffle. The egg was only one bite and the Shirako dish was only two bites but they were perfect in terms of flavour, texture and presentation. I also really enjoy the turle soup which was the Futamono with rice ball filled with turtle meat in a broth. \n\nThe Gohan or rice course was underwelming with a very small amount of uni. The cherry wood smoked sushi was also a bit too heavy on the smoked flavour.\n\nThe chef who served us was Chinese while the owner and head chef is Japanese. The coursing is traditional with a blend of warm and cold dishes. The service both the chefs and other wait staff was friendlier than at Omakase or Maruya.\n\nThe space is small but fully wheelchair accessible including the bathroom.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing.

There are only two seatings: one at 5PM and another at 8PM. We chose the later time so there would be no rush. While they can't guarantee that you will be seated at the sushi bar, you can request when you make the reservation and if you arrive early you have a pretty good chance!\n\nWe were lucky enough to have Chef Kusakabe himself prepare our meal and opted for the Grand Omakase ($150 with 15 courses and 25 pieces total).

My fiance and I are currently trying to buy a house yet Kusakabe let us to a real discussion of whether it would be better to put our money into a mortgage or maybe just eating at Kusakabe a couple times every week. I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish. Spoiler alert: You will likely feel compelled to continue after your omakase is done, there is just so much good stuff to try!\n\nHere's an overview of our meal. Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best. Dammit. Next time.\n\nAll in all it was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go again!

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers.

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.

Every piece of nigiri or dish presented to us was SO EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS. The fish literally MELTED in our mouths. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Everything was plated nicely which made it that much more appetizing too. What I really appreciated was Chef Nori's knife skills. He does all the cutting of the sashimi, and there would be assistants on each side of him that makes the nigiri rice.

Other sushi items were very fresh and prepared with proper proportion of ingredient vs rice (really important for things like uni).  By the way, having three types of uni to eat was very nice.\n\nOddly, there was very little focus on ebi (only one steamed ebi was available).

It was HOT!  I primarily used my napkin to wipe the sweat from my head while eating.  It started hot and it stayed hot the whole evening.\n\nSecond, the omakase menu was frustrating.  I come to a sushi restaurant to eat sushi.  I don't come to eat soup, to eat croquettes, or to eat many of the other little items that were presented.  The hot soup and croquette were the real insult given my already overheated condition.  And, I was too hungry and paying too much money to just not eat the soup, etc.  They should have an all sushi omakase available.  We soldiered through the omakase and then ordered lots more sushi.

I cannot even begin to describe how transcendental the experience was. It felt like we were transported away from SF and the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley and invited into Kusakabe's own cozy home. \n\nThe dinner started with a kombu-cha which blew our minds already with the amount of umami it contained. We then had zuke toro, bonito, the sushi chic, a jaw-dropping turtle dumpling soup, followed by more nigiri. While I cannot remember some of the specific fishes or the order of them as I'm writing this review months later, I do remember each piece being distinctly delicious. Chef Kusakabe brought about a lot of flavors that I haven't experienced in nigiri yet; he seems to love using citrus and acid as a way of lifting flavors and stimulating the senses.

Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}], "shirayaki": [{"excerpts": ["This was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper).

Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way.

Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper).

The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce.

The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom.

I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["- Bafun Uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin from Japan)\n- Shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel)\n- Hamo (Kyoto pike eel tempura style) -- MUST TRY!\n\n"], "author": "Cindy T.", "review": "I hate that I'm somewhat a sushi snob now, but I blame that solely on having sushi at Jiro's in Japan last spring. That one meal experience changed everything. Now on to Nori San. He is an expert sushi chef that I would say has mastered his craft, as well. And it was by chance and an absolute pleasure to be sitting at the bar, right in front of him, and being personally served by a master. It was like having front row seats to watching the master in action. \n\nThe whole meal was traditional in some sense (i.e. rice portion, rice temperature, no personal soy sauce), but non traditional in other ways that work. They offer only one choice -- $95 omakase dinner which is explores kaiseki principals to create a multi-course sushi menu. It was fascinating to watch him meticulously slice each fish and assemble it. Of course we ate everything that was offered on the menu, even getting both options where there were options. The finale for example, we were offered a choice between toro (bluefin fatty tuna) or grade A wagyu. I couldn't choose so I had both! The a la carte sushi menu was provided after our meal, and we ordered more than we had planned, but no regrets. The sushi here ranged from $8 - $15 each. The highlights were definitely the following and I recommend ordering the below four: \n\n- Uni (Mendocino sea urchin)\n- Bafun Uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin from Japan)\n- Shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel)\n- Hamo (Kyoto pike eel tempura style) -- MUST TRY!\n\nTo finish off dinner, there were three options for dessert and of course we said we'll take all three, please.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing.

My mother is just as crazy about sushi as I am (if not more) and after taking her to Wakuriya for her birthday, I had to find a comparable restaurant for Mother's day. Kusakabe is definitely of the same caliber as Wakuriya but the experience is entirely different.\n\nOmakase style dinner is pretty much the Japanese version of prix fixe except with a little bit more excitement to it because certain parts of the menu (specifically the sashimi) will change depending on what the sushi chef feels like making. That being said, the chances of you liking every single type of sashimi may not be 100% but that's to be expected with any tasting menu. Still, while certain cuts of sashimi were too thick or too chewy for my taste, there's no denying the freshness and quality of the fish. Of the omakase menu, my favorites were the Shigoku oyster with caviar with the petite plates, the miso glazed alaskan halibut, and the grade A5 wagyu beef. SO DELICIOUS. I'll have seconds of those three dishes, please.\n\nAfter the omakase (which lasts about 1.5 hours), they give you an a la carte menu to order from (you can only do a la carte after omakase).

Hassun: this was a beautifully arranged platter with lots of flavors and textures\n  - Oyster with caviar\n  - Tempura crab: coated in rice crackers\n  - Shrimp cake with sweet corn: best eaten warm; good with dipping salt \n  - Nasu agedashi: served in a little glass bowl with kani and ikura; this dish is very light\n  - Squid: very thinly sliced, with baby kiwi, toasted pine nuts, and wakame. The wakame was my favorite part of the dish\n  - Box sushi: tuna topped with bonito flakes\n  - Box sushi: tamago with a layer of crab underneath, topped with a goji berry \n  - Fried fish with red onion and a vinegar dashi\n\n5. Soup: Puree of cauliflower, which was very rich tasting. It came with a sweet potato paste in the center for more sweetness and thickness, abalone, trumpet mushrooms, abalone mushrooms\n\n6. Sushi Chic and Sushi Finale \n  - Shima aji: topped with daikon and yuzu\n  - Arctic char: with sea salt and yuzu \n  - Sanma: with grated ginger lime zest, and chives\n  - Uni, but I opted for non uni, and it was a torched oily snapper cured in kombu, which was really good \n  - Shirayaki: BBQ white eel, finished with a light drizzle of sauce and sansho pepper. I like that the sauce doesn't obscure the fish\n  - Wagyu (you could also choose toro): A5, super smooth and buttery\n\nExtras: prices range from $6-15 per piece (tamago vs uni)\n  - Jin kinmedai: golden eye snapper smoked in cherry wood\n  - Kisu: whiting cured with bonito and konbu\n\nWe were too full for dessert by the end.  It ends up being a lot of food.  My only complaint is that there's only one bathroom, so there can sometimes be a wait. \n\nService is always impeccable, and Chef Ngai did a great job of educating us on the dishes. Definitely get a seat at the sushi bar. I've done a table once, and it was NOT the same.  I think it's a party of 3 or so max for the sushi bar; otherwise, you get seated at the table.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-09-21"}], "tenjo buri": [], "yagara": [], "kibinago": [], "kasugodai": [{"excerpts": ["This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing. Service was also helpful and professional, and all in all it was fantastic value given the price, quantity, and quality of what I got.

Got served by the head chef himself -- except we didn't know that until the very end of the meal!! Got a photo with him too; he was very friendly and responsive to each of our questions and we had a light conversation throughout the entire meal -- he and the waiter serving us took great care in explaining each dish.\n\nTotal price for two was around $500, including the sake (I've never had an appreciation for dry sake before this, but man oh man). Let me tell you that this experience was life-changing. The food was phenomenal: there were a lot of firsts thrown in there that my boyfriend and I have never tried before or expected to be on the menu; the plating was simple but impactful; the course was designed around each other in perfect, delicious symphony.\n\nI believe we had the spring seasonal course. We enjoyed some of the dishes so much that we had to call back the waiter to tell us what it was again -- and then we took notes because we loved it so much!! Here are some of the notable favorites:\n- Japanese amberjack with plum base, cured kelp, and mountain yam\n- Kasugodai (cured) with bamboo leaf and red snapper\n- Two week aged otoro (fat of tuna)\n\nThis was an anniversary dinner and they gave both of the desserts we ordered on the house! Dishes were cleared in a better than timely manner -- it was like they were reading our minds! We were served at our own pace but each meal was made just in time for the plating. Also, we befriended the couple next to us, even exchanging contact information; goes to show that good food will bring people together.\n\nThank you, Chef Nori, for introducing us to fine dining in the most elegant, humble, and sumptuous way! We will be back again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-07-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. "], "author": "David K.", "review": "Kusakabe is an experience. You go for the chef-led omakase and are presented with course after course of beautifully-formed, high-quality dishes that take your palate on a little tour of Japanese flavors and techniques. The dining room is small and reservations are required, but I got to come with a group of seven friends, and it was a great experience trying and discussing all the different courses together. This is not your typical, run-of-the-mill sushi, so be prepared to splurge (the base menu comes at a hefty $98/head), and come with an appreciation for the quality and cost of purveyance of the ingredients. \n\nCourse #1: a subtly-flavored dashi broth. Nothing unusual (after all, there are only three ingredients in this fish-based broth), but very clean tasting and a nice way to start the meal.\n\nCourse #2: The zuku chutoro (bluefin medium fatty tuna) was seared on one side, giving the fish a great texture to complement its flavors. The hirame halibut with its own liver had a slightly spicy kick, and the cold-smoked bonito (katsuo) resounded with the flavors of the wood smoke.\n\nCourse #3: Bluefin sashimi and poached amberjack (a surprising favorite of mine). These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle. But my favorite dish was definitely the soft-shell crab, which was so creamy on the inside and delicately crunchy on the inside!\n\nCourse 5: Red miso soup with a duck and lotus root meatball, layered with soy cream foam. Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience! The restaurant itself is small but homey and authentic (the bathroom even features an automated Japanese toilet). The service is the epitome of Japanese hospitality and the prices are exorbitant, so make sure to come with an appreciation of the work, care, and quality that goes behind each bite of food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-11"}]}
