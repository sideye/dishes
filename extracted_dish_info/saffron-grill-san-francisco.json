And now that I am far from home, it's nice to try Indian food, but then I just feel disappointed, and with heart burn. But this place was different. \n\nI enter and it's a nice small, quaint restaurant with great art work and ambiance. We sit down and I get a little nervous because I don't see anyone Indian, but then I have to remind myself that all the Indians in the Bay Area are mostly in the Silicon Valley. We get seated and they serve me my favorite beer, Taj Mahal. Our server (I think she is part of the family business) asks how spicy we want our food and my friend said \"medium\" and I didn't feel like ordering a separate \"spicy\" dish so I just went with medium. She asked again, \"Are you sure?\" Girrrrrrrrl please, I'm Indian. \n\nWoah. WOAH. Holy woah! We ordered the sag paneer, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. They also served us spicy papad with the green chutney. It was the best Indian meal I have ever enjoyed at a restaurant. I think I will be having dreams about this restaurant.

It took a long time to get the food, but it was worth the wait. \n\nThe food is spicy and they could care less if you are Indian or if you are a cute little southern girl, they will bring it! They serve room temperature water which I love, but this time, I was craving ice. The food wasn't overly oily and overly \"masala-y\". I don't know why some Indian restaurants pour oil into their food and think that's okay. OR, they put every Indian spice that exists all into one dish and it's like a cardamom explosion in my mouth. \n\nWe didn't have any of the desserts but I think all of their heart and soul goes into their regular food. It would be nice for them to have homemade desserts too but that is very laborious. I was a little disappointed because they didn't have Bhindi (okra) but it's because their ingredients are all fresh and sometimes it's difficult to get fresh okra. She also told me that if I ever have their bhindi that I won't ever enjoy it anywhere else. She's right. Except that now applies for every Indian dish I order from now on. This place ranks up there next to my momma's cooking and my grandmomma's cooking! (They are a North Indian restaurant so no idli or dosa). \n\nSO DELICIOUS! MmMmMmm!

I'm used to Indian dishes being super rich and flavorful but this dish was just coming up short.  My friend got some sort of vindaloo and also felt that it lacked flavor.  The naan was standard but rice needed to be ordered separately for $3?  I'm used to all of my orders at an Indian restaurant coming with a side of basmati.  \n\nI've had some pretty terrible Indian food in the past, so that's the only reason why this place is getting three stars...it's a decent place to eat.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-09-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Their Paneer Tikka, paneer makhani and saag paneer are the best I've ever tasted in an Indian restaurant.

I am very pleased to report that Saffron Grill is that Indian restaurant!  Most Indian places douse their food in butter and cream, making the food way too rich and unhealthy.  Saffron Grill is the first place I've been to that doesn't overdo the cream and still masters the flavor. Their Paneer Tikka, paneer makhani and saag paneer are the best I've ever tasted in an Indian restaurant.  Also, the staff is awesome!

Saffron Grill did not disappoint! We ordered all vegetarian dishes: alloo gobi (potato and cauliflower), chana masala (chick peas), yellow dal (lentils), and sag paneer (spinach and cheese cubes). We also ordered naan (flat bread).\n\nAt pickup, the food was piping hot. Every dish was absolutely delicious, a perfect mixture of flavor and spiciness (all dishes ordered mild). Oftentimes, bean dishes at many restaurants are either under- or over-cooked. Saffron Grill's chana and dal were cooked to perfection!\n\nTotaling $60, the four entree dishes and three (large and delicious!) pieces of naan (plus rice I cooked at home) fed 4 hungry adults and 2 kids with leftovers. I think my 2 year old ate as much as I did! Thank you, Saffron Grill for letting me off the hook for dinner, in such a delicious way!
