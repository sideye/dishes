These were very good as most deep-fried goodies are, and since I do no deep-frying at home you can bet I'll order these again on a future visit.\n\nSo far in 2011 I've done a lot more cooking at home, and brown-bagging my meals for work have become the norm for me, but I know for a fact I can't make pho this good at home so I may need to rethink this whole not-going-out-to-restaurants-too-often thing thanks to the new Turtle Tower Restaurant.\n\nAs mentioned by another Yelper in her review some culinary surprises available only at this Turtle Tower location awaits you.

Its simplicity sets it apart from the southern style pho you'd find in most restaurants. You don't get the plate of garnishes considered standard with southern style, so you can't customize your pho. Northern pho is designed to eat exactly as is - though there were actually some sauces on the table and jalepenos brought on the side, so maybe pho bac isn't as strict as I thought. Or Turtle Tower has made a few compromises. Either way.\n\nI always think of parking in San Francisco as a big pain. Parallel parking and meters prevail, and I'm too lazy to deal with it all, so I rarely make it into the city. Parking here wasn't too bad, though. After a few laps around the block, I found a nearby spot. The SoMa location is on a corner easily accessible from the freeway and has a sunny interior, with shades of yellow and cool old photos on the walls. It was noisy, not a place you'd like to sit for hours, but comfortable enough.\n\nThe menu features pho, bun, cm, banh mi, and a few special items like chao (rice porridge) and even xoi (sticky rice). Though I've been advised to try the pho sot vang, I had to first try Turtle Tower's specialty, the pho ga.

I've gone to this place 3 or 4 times since they've opened.  In the beginning, there were some opening pains with handling the crowds and the quality wasn't up to the one on Larkin St, but I went there today, and the quality was excellent.  I think it takes awhile before a new location gets its footing if it ever does.  For a restaurant that gets so much traffic, I cannot figure out why they didn't rent a larger space.  I will give the complainers that.\n\nI can tell anyone who hasn't been to Vietnam that this is indeed real Pho.  Like any food, such as pizza or gumbo, there are many variations of Pho.  Most people have only experienced the southern flavor that is more aromatic and served with a side of herbs.  TT serves the northern style, the original version.  If you go to Vietnam, the northern style is the most favored version, even in the south.  It's actually harder to make good northern style Pho, and I wouldn't say TT has achieved the goal of matching northern style Pho that I've had in Vietnam.  With southern style, the herbs and spices sometimes cover up for mediocre soup.  Having eaten at the best Pho place on the planet many times, I can honestly say TT doesn't measure up, but it's pretty good for Pho in the USA, and it's the only northern style place I know of in America.  Also, Pho Ga isn't just the Vietnamese version of the chicken noodle soup.  They've been eating it for hundreds of years.  As for the best Pho on the planet, it's a northern style place in Saigon, which I won't name since it's already too popular among the locals in Saigon.  The flavor of that Pho is so vastly different and better than any Pho I've tasted across the USA.  It's really hard to describe.\n\nAnyway, I like this location because it's in a better neighborhood and forces me to walk 6 blocks to get my meal.  A healthy tasty meal after a nice walk, how can you beat that?  I love the chicken version.  After finishing the noodles, I just sit there and sip on the soup base.

Previously, I didn't even know such a thing even existed.

Let me start by saying that the broth from the pho actually tasted like chicken.  The limited spice and fish sauce added to the broth was not too salty and overpowering that it did not take the essential chicken taste away.  The rice noodles were wide and soft.  I normally like my noodles al dente, but in this particularly case, it matched really well with the broth and meat.  Finally, the chicken was pulled and cut into small bite size pieces with a mixture of dark and white meat.  It was a good contrast between the soft and more flavorful dark meat verus the firm but subtle taste of the white meat.  The giblets added a fulfilling crunch to every bite. \n\nThe nem cua was fried to perfection.  And in this particular case, I could actually taste the crab meat (There are a lot establishments elsewhere that would cheap out and increase the ratio of the pork filling). When eaten with the noodles and lettuce and dipped in the fish sauce, it's elevated to an whole new level.  Definitely recommend trying this dish here at least once.\n\nWhat's keeping me from giving this 5 stars was that the portion size were too small.  I judge a restaurant by the culinary experience I received versus the amount I paid.  I have no problem giving a shabby \"normal\" place a perfect score if the value accurately reflects it.  In this case I left the restaurant not hungry but not fulfilled.  In addition I don't think claiming that the chickens were raised \"free-ranged\" can justify the increase in price.  The USDA states that free-range only means that the animal has access to outdoors.  It does not regulate the amount of time the chicken is outdoors, the size of the outdoor space, or its food source. \n\nIn conclusion I definitely recommend this place to any pho lover.

A customer then walks in and sits down gesturing another server if he can sit at one of the empty tables by the window, a female worker, and she gives her approval and orders food soon thereafter.

I had enough and said \"let's just go\" and that's when the server dashed away. As we got up the (poor) female server. Was bringing the corrected order and said something along the line of \"so you're not staying?\" I felt bad for her. She was caught in the middle of all this and if I stayed at the original table none of this would have happened.

These were very good as most deep-fried goodies are, and since I do no deep-frying at home you can bet I'll order these again on a future visit.\n\nSo far in 2011 I've done a lot more cooking at home, and brown-bagging my meals for work have become the norm for me, but I know for a fact I can't make pho this good at home so I may need to rethink this whole not-going-out-to-restaurants-too-often thing thanks to the new Turtle Tower Restaurant.\n\nAs mentioned by another Yelper in her review some culinary surprises available only at this Turtle Tower location awaits you.

I know that they already can get Vietnamese food from Grab N Go across the street, but in my opinion TT's food is way better.\n\nThe space is smaller than the branch on Larkin street. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/turtle-tower-restaurant-san-francisco-3?select=4tmpNXJCPcq3MWQQOyokrA#4tmpNXJCPcq3MWQQOyokrA During this soft opening week they feature a limited menu, but the best news is that they told me that they'll start making custom made banh mi on the grand opening day. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/turtle-tower-restaurant-san-francisco-3?select=qPxHdydcJr9tM9QTa4xC_w#cw_9kbK5kfy_PJj88t3X1Q Note: don't expect it to be as cheap as Saigon sandos.\n\nThe banh mi (price yet to be determined) includes the standard butter, mayo, cilantro, carrots & jalapenos, then pick your choice of 3 proteins: pate, ham, sausage, fried egg, chicken, and pork. One of the few to offer a fried egg option, others are Bun Mee, Little Green Cyclo food truck, and Banh Mi Ba Le in Oakland.\n\nMost prices are similar to the Larkin location, including the imperial rolls for $2.15 each (ouch!). Except that most Pho (small $6.20-$7.20, large $7.20-$8.20) and entrees costs about 25 cents more here. Not by much, so I think it's okay.\n\nI'm concerned that this area has no foot traffic on weekends. Except for a few places like McDonald's, most eateries are open weekdays for lunch only. So I don't think it's wise for TT to have weekends hours. A soup business is different from other eateries. The stove remains on for long hours to keep the soup hot, so their utilities bill is high even when they have no customers.\n\nI'd like TT to remain in business, so they need to make some wise decisions from the beginning. Otherwise they'll suffer the same fate as all the previous tenants that went out of business at this corner.\n\nHours: daily 9am-9pm (revised 2013)\n\n** Update 2013: In case u ever found this shop closed, when u thought it was open. Here's a brief synopsis of the schedule changes. Initial operating hours were 7am-5pm, later extended to 9pm, with a break between lunch and dinner service. Later it changed to continuous service, to match their other locations. Then on January 2013, the schedule was cut to Mon-Sat 10am-4pm, closed Sundays. And in March 2013 they changed their minds again, so it's back to 9pm, including weekends.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-05-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Sure, the broth was good (not the best, though), but the chicken was chewy.

Yes.\n\nOk, so it's not in the best part of town, but if you're craving some stellar goi cuon, Turtle Tower is the place. I normally get my goi cuon with just shrimp -- the pork just never cut it for me. I forgot to say 'just shrimp' here, but no worries. At the Turtle, they use a succulent grilled pork which makes the goi cuon so much more flavorful. Their sauce was finger-lickin', too -- not too thick and not too runny.\n\nNow, what brought me here was Scoutmob's (Am I allowed to name drop like that?) free pho ga deal. The pho ga was subpar. Sure, the broth was good (not the best, though), but the chicken was chewy. Not ok. And, they keep the skin on the chicken. Maybe that's good for flavoring, but I don't like eating it. \n\nAfter soup, I wanted something cold (ice cold!). I had the chrysanthemum tea (from a can) and asked for ice so the sweetness could be diluted (you know me and not liking super sweet drinks).

I think it takes awhile before a new location gets its footing if it ever does.  For a restaurant that gets so much traffic, I cannot figure out why they didn't rent a larger space.  I will give the complainers that.\n\nI can tell anyone who hasn't been to Vietnam that this is indeed real Pho.  Like any food, such as pizza or gumbo, there are many variations of Pho.  Most people have only experienced the southern flavor that is more aromatic and served with a side of herbs.  TT serves the northern style, the original version.  If you go to Vietnam, the northern style is the most favored version, even in the south.  It's actually harder to make good northern style Pho, and I wouldn't say TT has achieved the goal of matching northern style Pho that I've had in Vietnam.  With southern style, the herbs and spices sometimes cover up for mediocre soup.  Having eaten at the best Pho place on the planet many times, I can honestly say TT doesn't measure up, but it's pretty good for Pho in the USA, and it's the only northern style place I know of in America.  Also, Pho Ga isn't just the Vietnamese version of the chicken noodle soup.  They've been eating it for hundreds of years.  As for the best Pho on the planet, it's a northern style place in Saigon, which I won't name since it's already too popular among the locals in Saigon.  The flavor of that Pho is so vastly different and better than any Pho I've tasted across the USA.  It's really hard to describe.\n\nAnyway, I like this location because it's in a better neighborhood and forces me to walk 6 blocks to get my meal.

I tried to order the rare beef, well done beef and tripe and instead of well done beef, I wanted to get another portion of rare beef.

The limited spice and fish sauce added to the broth was not too salty and overpowering that it did not take the essential chicken taste away.  The rice noodles were wide and soft.  I normally like my noodles al dente, but in this particularly case, it matched really well with the broth and meat.

When eaten with the noodles and lettuce and dipped in the fish sauce, it's elevated to an whole new level.  Definitely recommend trying this dish here at least once.\n\nWhat's keeping me from giving this 5 stars was that the portion size were too small.  I judge a restaurant by the culinary experience I received versus the amount I paid.  I have no problem giving a shabby \"normal\" place a perfect score if the value accurately reflects it.  In this case I left the restaurant not hungry but not fulfilled.  In addition I don't think claiming that the chickens were raised \"free-ranged\" can justify the increase in price.  The USDA states that free-range only means that the animal has access to outdoors.  It does not regulate the amount of time the chicken is outdoors, the size of the outdoor space, or its food source. \n\nIn conclusion I definitely recommend this place to any pho lover.

Not by much, so I think it's okay.\n\nI'm concerned that this area has no foot traffic on weekends. Except for a few places like McDonald's, most eateries are open weekdays for lunch only. So I don't think it's wise for TT to have weekends hours. A soup business is different from other eateries. The stove remains on for long hours to keep the soup hot, so their utilities bill is high even when they have no customers.\n\nI'd like TT to remain in business, so they need to make some wise decisions from the beginning.

With a long list on their whiteboard, I would think they would make every effort to turn their tables quickly.  I hate getting my check before I ask for it in a nice high end restaurant - but at a casual joint like Turtle Tower, they should be dropping those checks on the table as soon as the customer takes that last bite of banh mi or swallows that final spoonful of soup.

If you ask for a simple change in one of their menu items, they have to check with the boss first.  That is something you can prep your staff on beforehand.  I noticed one customer ordered a small bowl of noodles, received a big bowl, was charged for the big bowl, and when he questioned it on his bill, the server looked doubtful and asked another server for help.  I thought they would adjust his bill and only charge him for a small bowl but they didn't.  That doesn't seem like a smart business decision.\n\nThe banh mi is weird and not exactly authentic.

The #10 has shredded chicken meat and skin which provides texture and fattiness to an otherwise very lean dish. The chicken giblets were fantastic, although I did not care for the toughness of the kidneys (but that's just the nature of eating the kidneys). \n\nThis pho is from northern Vietnam which means it's not served with the plum sauce, sprouts, and basil that you might be used to.  You won't miss them much, as the chicken flavor is so pure and rich. \n\nApparently the place has been recently remodeled and looks quite nice inside, although they have too many tables in a cramped setting, so much so that one of the tables needed to be left empty as no more customers could squeeze in around it.\n\nI'll certainly be back for the pho ga, and maybe the steamed chicken with rice. \n\nPro Tip: Please don't put your chili sauce / sriracha directly into the broth. You're disrupting a balance in flavor that took hours to achieve. Put your chili sauce into the small saucer provided, and use as needed!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-12-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the chicken with chicken giblets pho ga and nem cua fried imperial rolls with vermicelli noodles and lettuce.

Previously, I didn't even know such a thing even existed.  And man was it delicious.  \n\nI ordered the chicken with chicken giblets pho ga and nem cua fried imperial rolls with vermicelli noodles and lettuce.  Let me start by saying that the broth from the pho actually tasted like chicken.  The limited spice and fish sauce added to the broth was not too salty and overpowering that it did not take the essential chicken taste away.  The rice noodles were wide and soft.  I normally like my noodles al dente, but in this particularly case, it matched really well with the broth and meat.  Finally, the chicken was pulled and cut into small bite size pieces with a mixture of dark and white meat.  It was a good contrast between the soft and more flavorful dark meat verus the firm but subtle taste of the white meat.  The giblets added a fulfilling crunch to every bite. \n\nThe nem cua was fried to perfection.  And in this particular case, I could actually taste the crab meat (There are a lot establishments elsewhere that would cheap out and increase the ratio of the pork filling). When eaten with the noodles and lettuce and dipped in the fish sauce, it's elevated to an whole new level.  Definitely recommend trying this dish here at least once.\n\nWhat's keeping me from giving this 5 stars was that the portion size were too small.  I judge a restaurant by the culinary experience I received versus the amount I paid.  I have no problem giving a shabby \"normal\" place a perfect score if the value accurately reflects it.  In this case I left the restaurant not hungry but not fulfilled.  In addition I don't think claiming that the chickens were raised \"free-ranged\" can justify the increase in price.  The USDA states that free-range only means that the animal has access to outdoors.  It does not regulate the amount of time the chicken is outdoors, the size of the outdoor space, or its food source. \n\nIn conclusion I definitely recommend this place to any pho lover.  I'm sure there are many non-Vietnamese people that would appreciate knowing there is a different style of pho out there.  Just don't expect to be stuffed of full when you finish your meal.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-07-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Another menu notable is the side dish \"Long Ga: Chicken Giblets\".

I didn't ask, but I figure you can choose the same item for all 3 or do two-and-one if you want.\n\nNote that the sandwich will be JUST the bread and whichever item(s) you select. If you want things that come standard on other restaurants' Vietnamese sandwiches, e.g., mayo, shredded carrots, cilantro, jalapenos, butter, etc., these can be added for $1.55 each.\n\nYes, each. As an example, think of a standard less-than-$5 chicken Vietnamese sandwich. It has bread, chicken, mayo (or something like it), cilantro, jalapenos, and shredded carrots, all included in the less-than-$5 price. This exact sandwich at Turtle Tower sets you back $10.70. Those following my Vietnamese math will recognize that this amount can get 3 sandwiches at Saigon Sandwich or a whopping 4 at Cam Huong. #justsayin\n\nAnother menu notable is the side dish \"Long Ga: Chicken Giblets\". Upon asking which giblets, I was told it's chicken intestines. A small is $3 and a large is $5. I'm definitely returning at some point to investigate.\n\nICED TEA: I watched the worker make this. It was a glass filled with 3/4 water then topped off with tea. I'm not talking about a glass of water into which were placed tea bags - this was already-brewed tea added to water. I could still taste the tea, but I thought the watering down aspect was odd.\n\nThe worker told me this location opened last year. So I'm guessing the 2007 and 2007-2008 ratings plaques on the wall were for the other locations.
