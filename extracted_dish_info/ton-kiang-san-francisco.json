On the upside, the servers are exceedingly polite (and speak English), and the interior is clean, comfy, and calm. On the downside, it is pricier for what it's worth, and the menu is more restricted since there is a significant portion devoted to Americanized items such as crab claws, egg rolls, pot stickers, and fruit salad.\n\nNonetheless, the dim sum is decently authentic, with enough variety that there was no shortage of items to order. In a blind taste test, I think some of the more basic dim-sum-cart places would be superior, but TK is good enough to satisfy my expectations (which are rather high, thanks to my many dim sum excursions in Hong Kong).\n\n(+++) Shrimp dumplings (\u8766\u9903) | $4.50: Mmm, explosively juicy, meaty shrimp. Probably my favorite dim sum here.\n(+) Pork dumplings (\u71d2\u8ce3)  | $4: Quite good, but I've had better. I think it needs more broth.\n(+) Chinese broccoli (\u82a5\u862d) | $6.25: Nice crunch, fresh veggies, but a bit too oily.\n(+) Stuffed eggplant | $5: Tasty, but the eggplant soaked up a lot of oil.\n(-) Beef crepe (\u725b\u8089\u8178\u7c89) | $4.50: Probably the most unimpressive, the texture was the beef seemed a bit like meatloaf. Also, the rolls were oddly very flat.\n(++) Dried bean curd roll (\u9bae\u7af9\u6372) | $4.50: Delicious, though the pork seems fattier than other places I've had this dish.\n(+++) Wasabi mustard sauce | I'm almost never a fan of sauces, but this was a highlight of the meal! The wasabi was strong, synergized well with the mustard, and was an excellent addition to essentially all of the dim sum.\n\nTK is not as gimmicky as the juggernaut Koi Palace/Dragon Beaux duo, whose multicolored XLB and the like may be more appealing to foodies/Instagrammers. TK is halfway between upscale fancy d down-to-earth good food, resulting in satisfying dim sum in a cozy environment but at slightly marked-up prices. \n\nThe verdict: 4 stars for those with a YOLO'ers, hard-core foodies, and rich people who work in tech; 3 stars for anyone on a grad student budget like myself :3", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-04-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Vegetable Egg rolls (killer)\n", "Fun got (Mushrooms and shrimp) ", "(killer)\n", "Sticky rice (killer)\n", "Hargow (just okay)\n", "Siumai (just okay)\n", "Sticky rice (killer)\n"], "author": "Ben M.", "review": "I have always wanted to check this place out but it's normally really busy, we got here right when it opened and got the first seat.

Gai Lan is a \"must have\" for me any time I am eating dim sum. This place cooks the broccoli perfectly. Al dente. Only *heh* is that the oyster sauce is served in a side dish. I like my oyster sauce served on the gai lan as soon as it's done cooking, so that the heat from the vegetable heats up the sauce, so you do not have cold sauce on hot veggies. Make sure you add a bit a chili oil. \n\n2. BBQ Pork steam buns, pot sticker, prawns w/ glazed walnut : Standard. No complains, no raves. \n\n3. Fried rice: Has a lot of flavor. It's worth ordering. \n\n4.Hai Kim (Shrimp Stuffed Crab Claw): The meat inside is flaky, not soggy and very hot (to the touch). Be careful when you bite into it. The outside; very crunchy. Overall; Pretty good.   \n\n5.Shrimp stuffed eggplant:\nThis dish is very good. The skin on the eggplant is thick and a little tough and hard to cut with your teeth. Make sure you get both the eggplant and the shrimp in one bite. The two together taste very unique and very good; sweet from the eggplant and savory from the shrimp. On their own, the eggplant is eggplant and the shrimp is shrimp. Again, very hot, be careful. \n\n6. Vegetarian Egg Rolls: Slightly Below Average. These are extremely hot when you bite into them if they have cooked them fresh. I burnt my tongue. Whoops! They are also very greasy. I've had better. \n\n7. I was not impressed that this place did not have a birds nest.\n\nService and Tips: Slightly below average.\n~ The waiters are not as fast as a traditional dim sum place with carts and what not. \n~ Order as many dim sum dishes as you can and try everything. \nAsk for as many dishes of chili oil before you get your food.

As we were walking out, my boyfriend noted to me that the owners must be evil genius masterminds to have had such great reviews, which we verily assumed were written by people who do not frequent dim sum restaurants often...if ever.) \n\nFirst impressions and Points:\n1. Wow, pretty clean. Wait, is that a wine bar?! What the heck Chinese restaurant sells wine?! hm. something seems off. I tell the waitress two people (in Cantonese no less) and she tells me \"Upstairs\". No wait? No frantic yelling of numbers and nosy parents peeking at the list? Hm.\n2. Sit down at a table, look around. Hm. Is it telling that we're the only table of Asian people here? Where are all the carts?\n3. Gah! It's a continual carousel of English-only ladies carrying trays of food. They perch their tray on our table every 30 seconds and ask \"Shrimp dumpling? Steamed Asparagus? Tea Leaf Salad?\" While trying to hold a conversation we have to keep stopping to say No thanks, no thanks. \n4. After we had ordered two dishes, we were still waiting for someone to ask us what kind of tea. I finally flag down a waiter, and he drops by the table. I say \"Tea, please, I'd like to order some Bo--\" \"Just green tea\" and zip he's gone. What the hell? Come back dude, I didn't tell you what kind I want. Green tea?! What?! It took another eight minutes for him to come back with a teapot of green tea and a dish of chinese mustard and salsa verde. What?! Salsa? Where's my tortilla chips? I'm so confused.\n5. Ordered a plate of shrimp wrapped in rice noodle sheets. (haw cheung fun). She stamps it in the $5 category. No freakin' way. $5 for a dinky plate? Ugh, plus we found a hair steamed into the rice noodle. We called the manager over and she replaced it with another one. That was nice, but still ew, a hair in the noodle?! I'd expect the same dish maybe $3 or $4 at other places. When you order a lot of dim sum, that dollar difference really adds up.\n6. The dim sum was okay, nothing fantastic or terrible. If anything I was mystified by the offerings. Vegetarian egg rolls? Steamed asparagus? Tea leaf salad? (i know burma superstar is popular but really now...) There's standard fare, but the plate of four small steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow) was $4. We ordered five dishes and our bill came to $23 plus tax and tip. \n7. Are they playing bamboo flute music in the background?!\n\nUgh. I do have to finish up by saying that I don't think these are all awful things. I don't reaaally blame the restaurant. I blame Yelp and the SF Chron, and other food reviewers, and my own gullibility. I was the one who chose to come to this restaurant. I just don't think its the right place for me. I prefer Cantonese Dim Sum places that are boisterous and loud, full of rolling carts and hostesses with walkie-talkies in hand. Delicious dim sum that will totally fill you up for just $8-11 a person. A choice of the tea, and mustard and chili sauce. Traditional dim sum and new innovations for dim sum like shrimp and mango dumplings. \n\nHowever, if you do not know dim sum at all, or you want to really slowly bring some new sheep to the fold, or being in a restaurant full of loud Chinese families scares you, this is probably a great place for you. No, seriously. There's a picture menu with the dim sum in english and chinese, there are lots of english-speaking waitresses who come to you, who you don't have to wave down half the room away, and you can pay the high price and feel good for trying something new. \n\nJust don't go if you're someone like me, who likes the old traditional way of dim sum.\n\n*Granted, I am saying this as a second generation Cantonese-speaking lady who has had experience with fantastic dim sum in the city.

The chicken feet was actually pretty good.  Everything else was garbage.  The chicken sticky rice tasted like it had salted fish in it.  The shrimp in the fried rice was slimy.  The filling in the bbq pork fun was grayish in color.  \n\nIt was also pretty darn expensive.  Granted it is xmas, so they can jack up the prices.  The shrimp fried rice was $18!  Everything for 6 people who doesn't eat much.... a whopping $105, not including gratuity.  \n\nNeedless to say, I'm not going back to Ton Kiang ever again unless I absolutely have to.", "rating": 1, "date": "2008-12-25"}], "mixed seafood fried rice": [], "prawns and pork fried rice": []}
