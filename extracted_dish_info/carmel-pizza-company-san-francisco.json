Oh man, we are just dying to go back to have their margerita pizza again!\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe wife and I were out at Fort Mason to check out an arts and crafts show.  We parked a bit farther than expected, so we decided to have lunch first before we went to the show.  \n\nCARMEL PIZZA\nA tiny little place in the famous Fisherman's Wharf area, CPC is a nicely decorated place with quite the Italian theme going.  They really created a great little atmosphere in such a small space.  We were impressed and I think you will be too.  \n\nOne thing though that you might find difficult if you're under 5'10\" is the very unusually high counter.\n\nFOOD\nAs we didn't want to be too full going to the show, we split their margherita pizza, a soda, and a bottle of water.

The decor is almost like walking into an enchanted forest. Just simply breathtaking. Its like a food truck with a nice decorative tent over it.\n\nThey have an outdoor set up however covered outdoor area with heat lamps on top of the corner tables . This was great as it was a bit chilly when I went in April.\nWe ordered the Romantico pizza which had mozzarella, Arugula, Balsamic Glaze and Heirloom Tomato . The pizza was $18.00 which I thought was okay however I was also expecting a much more larger pizza. It was around 7:45pm when we ordered this pizza. I do feel like I left hungry from here as they were advertised to close at 9 on that day. We tried to order another pizza at 8:30pm and they were already closing their service which was absurd. I was annoyed that even though we were in the restaurant and it was no where near 9pm we still had a half hour , we weren't able to order more food.\n\nThis is why I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5. How do you close a half hour before your closing time and stop taking orders?\nThe pizza also was really good and well done. However, NOT WORTH THE $18.00. If you are going to charge that much money for a small size pizza please increase the portion size. That was way too small of a pizza it was meant for just 1 person.\n\nEven though the scenery and feel of this place was extremely relaxed and romantic. I wouldn't go back to this place for two reasons-  1 THE PRICE and 2 false advertisement on that day. \n\nOther than that go early and order more pizza on the first go before you leave this place hungry.\n\nI felt rushed and over all paid way more than I feel I should have for this pizza. I understand the fresh ingredients and taste but that was way too much.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-05-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the romantico pizza and it was awesome.

I looked all of them up on Yelp and this one had the best reviews, so we decided to try it.  After a LONG day walking around the city, we were exhausted and hungry.  The place is small, but wasn't too busy for a Saturday night.  All outdoor seating, but they have heat lamps so it wasn't cold at all.  We ordered 2 pizzas between the 3 of us.  We had a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  Our friends that were with us had the pizza panini.  Everything we ordered was delicious. They use very fresh ingredients in everything, and the pizza is thin crust, but the crust is amazingly delicious.  They say the pizzas are supposed to be sort of individual sized, but we had 2 pizzas between 3 of us and there were a couple of extra pieces, so our friends ate them.  We could not waste that delicious pizza!\n\nThey serve beer and wine, although a limited selection, and sodas, which are in a case and you help yourself.  Very informal, but definitely worth a visit.  We liked it so much that we decided to go back again a couple of nights later.  \n\nThe second time i ordered a ceasar salad, which was $9 so i though it would be fairly large.  it was really just an individual portion.  I think the pizza's and other items on the menu are reasonably priced, but $9 for a ceasar salad...really?", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-01-28"}]}
