I wish they had served the cheese with crackers or a crunchier bread.\n\nService here could definitely have been better. Pretty slow and inattentive. It took a while for someone to take our order and the server walked away to put our order in before we had actually finished giving him our order. We asked someone later about ordering the rest of our food and the girl said she'd let the server know, but that didn't happen for a while.\n\nStill a solid spot for happy hour though.

After waiting outside for about 20 minutes with 3 or 4 other groups and watching the wait staff wander around empty tables, we ended up taking a seat at the bar. \n\nIt took awhile for anyone to come over and acknowledge we were there, which is surprising since the inside of this place is not very big. The kitchen was pretty busy and apparently this requires a manager to  stand and shout orders to the chefs. He scolded a chef in front of everyone and most people at the bar could hear. I know it's a restaurant and things like this happen, but please keep it in the kitchen and not out in front of your customers.\n\nThe food was good. The lady had the burger and a side of truffle fries, both were very good. I had prosciutto & avocado benedict, it came out cold but at that point I didn't care. Their French press coffee is very good as well. At this point we were going to give them the benefit of the doubt because of the food. However, we ended up sitting for the next hour or so as each member of the staff walked by us (we even stacked our plates in hopes they would notice). We did get to witness them running out of practically everything on the menu as a group of 6 was seated by the hostess. \n\nOverall, service needs a lot of work. Maybe we caught them on a bad day but from reading other reviews it sounds pretty common. It wouldn't hurt them to clean up some of the junk around the place either (empty tv box, clutter, fruit flies). Be prepared for shoddy service and cold food.
