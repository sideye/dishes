There is nothing worse then old seafood. It will rot your insides. I reasoned with her to stop eating but being that she was a little intoxicated, famished, and less particular then I am she kept on. She paid for her choice later on that night.\n\nNow I must say that I know good Mexican food. I have happily enjoyed everything from high end Mexican cuisine, to taco truck Mex. Simply put: good food, is good food. Taqueria Los Coyotes did not serve us good food. In fact it was probably some of the worst taqueria grub I have ever had.

Every component fresh, flavorful, cooked well, and all complemented each other.\n\nAlso had an impromptu flight of Mexican beers to go with the excellent taqueria food.  Economical and great food.

I'm betting that their usual staples such as their burritos and tacos are probably really good.

And let me tell you, homerun both times.  The first time it may or may not have been Cinco De Mayo a few years back and I can neither confirm nor deny that beers were \"buy one get one free\" and I didn't have like 4 or so.  But the second time I was stone cold sober like a good mommy of a 10 month old should be.\n\nAfter buying our couch at El Corazon Gallery (review to come upon delivery of said goods), we drove down Mission looking for some high quality Mexican food.  I'm from San Diego and they know how to GET DOWN on that comida, so I'm kind of a snob when it comes to Bay Area \"mexican\" eateries.  I remembered eating at this place a few years back and suggested it to my chauffer, AKA boyfriend.  He happily obliged since he trusts my impeccable taste in burritos and the like.  Parking was super easy and the line was short when we walked in.  All the cooks greeted us and the guy at the register took our order.\n\nCarne asada torta\nEnchiladas plate, no salsa or guacamole\nCarne asada fries, no salsa or guacamole\nCheese quesadilla, no salsa or guacamole\n\nSee the pattern?\n\nThe gentleman who took our order caught on to the trend halfway through the order and asked if everything be prepared sans salsa and guacamole.  Total gem.  I don't like onions and I'm swell-up-like-the-elephant-man allergic to avocados.  Odd since my grandfather made his living growing them.  But that's the irony of my life.\n\nThe salsa bar was extensive and delicious, minus the avocado one that looked like a tasty green heaven I'd die from.  The salsa verde was SO GOOD.  A little spicy for my half-white tastebuds, but the sour cream calmed the firestorm and I ate enough chile verde to bleed salsa.  The mild salsa was pretty excellent as well.  However, I just dipped the little plastic cup into the concoction and walked away with the liquid, no tomatoes, no onions.  DON'T JUDGE ME!\n\nThe enchiladas were so friggin' fantastic.  Half red sauce, half green sauce, complete taste bud delight.  The carne asada fries were definitely a worthy adversary to San Diego's offerings, but Santana's in San Diego runs the market on the fries.  Sorry Los Coyotes.  The quesadilla was perfectly crisp with the right texture of melted cheese.  Of course I slathered it in that little verde river of happiness.  Sadly, I could not taste the torta because my boyfriend \"accidentally\" forgot to say no avocado.  But between you, me and the rest of yelp...I think he did it so I wouldn't consume half of his meal.  Clever man!\n\nSo yes, I answered my question of whether or not this place is actually that good or if beer belly reigned supreme.  It is THAT good.  And next time I'm in this neck of the woods, you bet your ass I'll be ordering half the menu again.
