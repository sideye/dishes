I even did a speech in college about her....yah, don't ask. \n\nTwenty minutes in, I sat there utterly confused and thought maybe I was watching the wrong channel. Or, maybe it was the Fernet goggles because I didn't see Britney anywhere so I watched the re-run again last night...sober.\n\nDammit, Lifetime with all the blondes in Hollywood you could of least found a girl that resembles Britney's seventh cousin...that actress looked nothing like her! \n\nAnd, don't get me started on that Britney and Justin post-breakup dance off. It was like walking into the room to find your parents wheelbarrowing - awkwardly bad. \n\nPretty sure all of Britney fans who saw that atrocity felt duped. \n\nThat's how I feel when Yelp leads me astray (duped, that is)....\n\nAn Chi came up as one of the \"hot and new\" businesses on Yelp. Boosting all 5 star reviews, I thought maybe this was the unicorn of all Asian restaurants in Excelsior! If you're familiar with the area, you know the area has great Mexican eateries where you can stuff your face with offal goodness for under $10. But...everything else? Ehhh. \n\nAn Chi's menu is surprisingly small for a Vietnamese restaurant with just 3-4 options each for appetizers, banh mi, pho, bun, and com dia. They have Vietnamese iced coffee but no che or Vietnamese drinks (e.g. coconut juice, sugar cane juice, etc). \n\nThe prices are reasonable with everything under $8.50 but with smaller portions compared to other Vietnamese eateries. Cc's accepted. \n\nGiven how condensed the menu is, I assumed the food would be solid since the chef can perfect a handful of items as opposed to 100 items on the menu. Not to mention all those glowing 5 star reviews....\n\nUnfortunately, the food at An Chi was less than average and comparable to 3 star Vietnamese eateries in Daly City, South San Francisco, and San Bruno. \n\nWe started with the Cha Gio: Imperial Rolls ($5): http://bit.ly/2ldRP4Q which were decent. Hot and crunchy, you can never go wrong with fried anything. The accompanying vermicelli was a clump of overcooked noodles though. \n\nI ordered the Lemongrass Pork Rice Plate ($7): http://bit.ly/2ldRCPo. The pork chop was thin and had a lot of bones. Seasoning was on the sweeter side. The server was honest about their light usage of msg which I greatly appreciated. I was thirsty afterwards but didn't get the usual tongue numbness, headache, and heart palpitations so the msg usage is minimal.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pho Dac Biet: Pho Combo (Large - $8.50) which was meh. The broth is chicken based and the meats were dry and chewy. I had a sip of the broth - it was salty and didn't have that clean chickeny flavor. \n\nThe staff is nice but one of our orders was wrong. My friend had asked for rare beef on the side and it was well done in the bowl. We told the server, \"Sorry, but we asked for rare beef on the side\" to which he replied, \"Well, the cook put the beef in the bowl\" and then walked away. All he had to do was to ask the kitchen to put several slices of raw beef on a plate to rectify the issue. Not a good impression for a grand opening but this has no bearing on my rating since you don't visit Asian restaurants for the stellar service. \n\nParking is very difficult so unless you live in the area, An Chi is not worth trekking across the city for. \n\nSorry, I'll stick with going to the TL or to Ben Tre in Millbrae for solid Vietnamese food.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-02-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the combo special and it was a large bowl of Pho Dac Biet and a Vietnamese sandwich for $13.50 plus tax And tip.   \n\n"], "author": "Tam N.", "review": "Finally.
