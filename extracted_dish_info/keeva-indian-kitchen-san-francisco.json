An Indian restaurant recently popped up in the Richmond district, which has hitherto been a Chinese, Vietnamese or Thai stronghold. It is for sure a welcome addition to the dining scene on Clement. For a change, try some biryani instead of fried rice! Keeva took over a Thai place without much fanfare. The d\u00e9cor was not overdone but tastefully designed to be simple, clean and adorned with some fine artworks on the walls. Against the right wall was a long wooden bench with attractive cushions that were wrapped in exotic Indian-colored fabric.\n\nThe menu listed a few \"starters\" (oh so British!). Pakora ($6) seemed the most popular. Traditionally, pakora were served as deep-fried snacks like fritters. They caught my attention although I'm not even a big fan of fried foods. Keeva's version using a chickpea batter gave the pakora a unique crispy and nutty coating.  I personally liked that. The deep-frying was done almost perfectly without much grease but some pieces were still a tad soft and soggy. A duo of dippables, a dark colored tamarind and greenish mint chutney, were an awesome complement. (4/5)\n\nIt is rare to come across Egg Curry in a restaurant's menu. Perhaps it is now regarded as home style cooking. Nevertheless, it ranks high on my list of comfort foods. It is my favorite when I don't wish to have any chicken, meat or fish. I was told that Keeva's version is North Indian and I'll bet there are as many regional differences as there are egg sauces. Keeva is not about to disclose their recipes except to mention that the sauce is housemade with fresh tomatoes and onions. You can see why! The curry sauce was delicious and the heat level can be adjusted in accordance to your personal preference. The negative? Only 2 hard-boiled eggs lightly fried to form a delectable crust but at a steep price tag of $13.50! How much is the price of an egg nowadays? But the fact remained it was good....in fact damn good! (4/5) Cute name too \"Bang Bang Egg Curry\".\n\nChicken Tandoori (half $12.50; whole $24) in Keeva is a notch better than most. There was a fragrant crispy crust on the surface and blackened char on the edges and bones; the meat was moist, luscious and savory.  I would have preferred the chicken to be served on a hot sizzling plate with the chicken nestled on a bed of yellow onions and bell peppers. This way, the chicken would be kept warm while the tantalizing aroma filled the dining room. (4/5)\n\nI always have this preconceived notion that Indian food is rice and curry. In my mind, a perfect ending to an Indian meal would always be Lamb Vindaloo ($14.50), which is my favorite. The curry had a hint of sourness from the nuanced vinegary marinade. This is the Goan style that Keeva was attempting to replicate. A potpourri of Indian spices contributed to the complex and robust flavors. It was tongue tingling perfect, and scrumptiously memorable served at my desired level of heat.  The potatoes were firm and crunchy to the bite and the lamb was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" tender. (4/5)\n\nUnfortunately being located in a nondescript strip mall on Clement among the Chinese and Vietnamese cheap eats, the prices in Keeva do appear relatively pricey. We are of course comparing apples with oranges but there are people out there who don't care two hoots!

The appetizers would make you want more, especially their Veg Hara Bhara Kebab. On the main course I would highly recommend Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Chettinad.

We also had a chance to try their Channa Masala and Crusted Cumin potatoes and we were for sure not disappointed. The biryanis are great too and if you become a regular or have small parties then Ajit (the owner) and the chef can whip up some special items on request. We once had Chicken Dum Biryani on request-to-order and it was really good. \nKeeva is a must try for anyone who yearns for some mouth watering Indian fare.

A major complaint I have with a lot of Indian restaurants in the US is that the curries start to all taste like variations of Tikka Masala with too many creams and too much liquid. Dishes at Keeva have all been very distinct tasting to me, with their iteration of Chicken Tikka Masala itself really standing out for having the spices more pronounced than an overflowing amount of bland cream and sauce. \n\nFor me so far though, the real stand out has been their Dal Makhani, which has a delicious creamy, buttery texture but the spices and lentils tasting strong.In fact all of the vegetarian dishes have been surprisingly really stand out, such as Aloo Gobi Masala and I really recommend even the most ardent meat eaters to consider trying them. That said though, the Chicken Vindaloo is also delicious. The presentation of all of these dishes has been consistently wonderful as well.\n\nI haven't tried any of the Tandoor Kebabs yet though I really want to.\n\nI have to give particular note to Keeva's lunch special as well. A simple choice between a vegetarian or non vegetarian set of 3 sampler curries or paneers, a small bit of salad, and some rice and naan. For someone who likes meals made up of samplers like myself, it's a great and simple lunch.\n\nI could maybe understand the criticism I've seen a few times that the food might be a bit too light for people who want heavier (and some would say more traditionally Indian) spiciness as the food's default is a little more of a locally palatable heat, however it is possible to ask for the spiciness of something to be upped upon ordering.\n\nService has been consistently friendly, prompt, and relaxed.\n\nAll and all, I really recommend giving this place a try if you can, as I believe it has the potential to be a local stand out in the Richmond area.

An Indian restaurant recently popped up in the Richmond district, which has hitherto been a Chinese, Vietnamese or Thai stronghold. It is for sure a welcome addition to the dining scene on Clement. For a change, try some biryani instead of fried rice! Keeva took over a Thai place without much fanfare. The d\u00e9cor was not overdone but tastefully designed to be simple, clean and adorned with some fine artworks on the walls. Against the right wall was a long wooden bench with attractive cushions that were wrapped in exotic Indian-colored fabric.\n\nThe menu listed a few \"starters\" (oh so British!). Pakora ($6) seemed the most popular. Traditionally, pakora were served as deep-fried snacks like fritters. They caught my attention although I'm not even a big fan of fried foods. Keeva's version using a chickpea batter gave the pakora a unique crispy and nutty coating.  I personally liked that. The deep-frying was done almost perfectly without much grease but some pieces were still a tad soft and soggy. A duo of dippables, a dark colored tamarind and greenish mint chutney, were an awesome complement. (4/5)\n\nIt is rare to come across Egg Curry in a restaurant's menu. Perhaps it is now regarded as home style cooking. Nevertheless, it ranks high on my list of comfort foods. It is my favorite when I don't wish to have any chicken, meat or fish. I was told that Keeva's version is North Indian and I'll bet there are as many regional differences as there are egg sauces. Keeva is not about to disclose their recipes except to mention that the sauce is housemade with fresh tomatoes and onions. You can see why! The curry sauce was delicious and the heat level can be adjusted in accordance to your personal preference. The negative? Only 2 hard-boiled eggs lightly fried to form a delectable crust but at a steep price tag of $13.50! How much is the price of an egg nowadays? But the fact remained it was good....in fact damn good! (4/5) Cute name too \"Bang Bang Egg Curry\".\n\nChicken Tandoori (half $12.50; whole $24) in Keeva is a notch better than most. There was a fragrant crispy crust on the surface and blackened char on the edges and bones; the meat was moist, luscious and savory.  I would have preferred the chicken to be served on a hot sizzling plate with the chicken nestled on a bed of yellow onions and bell peppers. This way, the chicken would be kept warm while the tantalizing aroma filled the dining room. (4/5)\n\nI always have this preconceived notion that Indian food is rice and curry. In my mind, a perfect ending to an Indian meal would always be Lamb Vindaloo ($14.50), which is my favorite. The curry had a hint of sourness from the nuanced vinegary marinade. This is the Goan style that Keeva was attempting to replicate. A potpourri of Indian spices contributed to the complex and robust flavors. It was tongue tingling perfect, and scrumptiously memorable served at my desired level of heat.  The potatoes were firm and crunchy to the bite and the lamb was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" tender. (4/5)\n\nUnfortunately being located in a nondescript strip mall on Clement among the Chinese and Vietnamese cheap eats, the prices in Keeva do appear relatively pricey. We are of course comparing apples with oranges but there are people out there who don't care two hoots!

My work colleague said it was \"hands down the best saag (Indian spinach dish)\" he has ever eaten and traditional in style (not that creamy buttery mess that most places have). \n\n5 min drive from my place, easy parking on a rainy day in the city when people stay in --- all right, why not, let's try it.\n\nMy wife is raised in Delhi and her father is a tremendous cook. My Mom is an off the charts Indian cook. Our bar is pretty high. So I don't expect much either from Indian restaurants -usually I go to Indian places as \"comfort food\" - it's fatty but yummy, fills you up, you feel happy, you go home, you pass out. Given all the \"hands down\" I was hoping this place wasn't going to be that. So we ordered:\n\nStarter:\nHara bara kebab\nIt's relatively rare to find this appetizer. It's simple sounding but hard to make well. This was the best I have had in many many years. WOW. Perfect texture. Perfect balance. Practically melted in my mouth upon first bite. Amazing. Now I had high hopes for the rest of the meal.\n\nDish 1:\nGoat Curry Classic\nMy wife gew up eating goat and not lamb. She never orders goat at places since again, master chef Dad makes insanely good goat at home. We ordered it here. Fantastic. Flavorful. Spicy but not too spicy. Spot on.\n\nDish 2:\nTandoor chicken half\nSTAR OF THE SHOW\nWhat in the freaking world? Are you kidding me? On Clement street? Did this just happen?\nPresentation was lovely. Side chutney paired perfectly. Chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly, and that is the FIRST time in SF I can say that about tandoori chicken. Reminded me of the best of Delhi actually.

They had this foam on top of the ras malai itself (high end restaurant dessert style influence?). Creative!\n\nPRICES:\nI put this in caps since I think people have it all wrong. \"It's a little expensive for Indian\"  seems to be in some reviews. That's like saying Californios (Michelin Star, 4.5 Yelp review) is \"expensive for Mexican food\" -- dude, not all food from a culture is created equal!!! Nobody goes to Kokkari and says \"this is expensive for Greek food\" comparing it to your local lunch spot that serves gyros.  Yes, if this was cream heavy, butter heavy, not so fresh typical Indian takeout at $10 a dish, sure, it's a few bucks a dish bit more than that. But for the quality and presentation, it was worth every penny and I think actually their prices are beyond fair for the quality, vs some Indian places at $8 a person I find over priced for the quality. \n- tl:dr version --- you get what you pay for, and the quality to price ratio here is an A+\n\nOverall, I walked out knowing we will be back, having had the best tandoori chicken I've had at a restaurant in decades (sorry, Amber, you're not even close), feeling like SF finally had an Indian restaurant that I look forward to and don't feel fat the next day after eating.

A major complaint I have with a lot of Indian restaurants in the US is that the curries start to all taste like variations of Tikka Masala with too many creams and too much liquid. Dishes at Keeva have all been very distinct tasting to me, with their iteration of Chicken Tikka Masala itself really standing out for having the spices more pronounced than an overflowing amount of bland cream and sauce. \n\nFor me so far though, the real stand out has been their Dal Makhani, which has a delicious creamy, buttery texture but the spices and lentils tasting strong.In fact all of the vegetarian dishes have been surprisingly really stand out, such as Aloo Gobi Masala and I really recommend even the most ardent meat eaters to consider trying them. That said though, the Chicken Vindaloo is also delicious. The presentation of all of these dishes has been consistently wonderful as well.\n\nI haven't tried any of the Tandoor Kebabs yet though I really want to.\n\nI have to give particular note to Keeva's lunch special as well. A simple choice between a vegetarian or non vegetarian set of 3 sampler curries or paneers, a small bit of salad, and some rice and naan. For someone who likes meals made up of samplers like myself, it's a great and simple lunch.\n\nI could maybe understand the criticism I've seen a few times that the food might be a bit too light for people who want heavier (and some would say more traditionally Indian) spiciness as the food's default is a little more of a locally palatable heat, however it is possible to ask for the spiciness of something to be upped upon ordering.\n\nService has been consistently friendly, prompt, and relaxed.\n\nAll and all, I really recommend giving this place a try if you can, as I believe it has the potential to be a local stand out in the Richmond area.

This samosa is juicy, with a moist interior filled with vegetables and very flavorful.  The outside was crisp, with its own unique flavor but not doughy\n\nThe Lamb Roganjosh was outstanding along with the Aloob Gobi Masala (cauliflower and potato in tomato ginger).  The lamb is NOT the usual bony lamb, nor does this lamb even hint at gristle so often found in cheaper cuts of lamb so often encountered elsewhere.  You'll find the meat dishes here plump, tender, juicy and tasty.\n\nA real winner is the Indian Eggplant in Salan sauce.  Shaped like large Jalape\u00f1o peppers but darker skinned, the Indian Eggplant is succulent, with a touch of firmness, yet soft and inviting to bite into!  Now, add the salan sauce, and coupled with rice, makes a fabulous mouth-watering treat.\n\nThe nan is also excellent...a touch greasy on the outside, but moist, tender, with just the slightest hint of crispness here and there.\n\nFood is spiced as follows: Mild, moderate and hot.

The ambience is lovely as well, with stenciled walls, original artwork, and comfy pillows to recline on. Our meal was great, but even better was the rasmalai. I'm a huge fan of Indian desserts, and this one was the best I've had, and a very refreshing end to a decadent dinner.
