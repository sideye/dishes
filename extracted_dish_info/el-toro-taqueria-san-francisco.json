The tofu comes diced in cubes with a tomato based sauce. I was hoping tofu that was not cubed but more like a ground tofu texture, like soyfritas at Chipotle, it is better for a taco; I added salt but for $2.50 it was decent. The chips were thin and toasted right, they are unsalted. The guacamole was authentic, too mashed for my liking but good nonetheless, it could have used more lime, I also added salt. My meal in total was $5 and that was amazing, it was a very good low price for chips, guac, taco, and soda can.\n I did not mind adding salt to my food, I was expecting the usual from Mexican food, enhanced flavors and spice, but I got non. This is not necessary a bad thing either, they have salt and pepper on te tables and they allow the natural flavors of the ingredients (vegetables, grains, etc) to stand out in their own right. El Toro Taqueria provided you a canvas for you to add salt and pepper as you wish (flavor enhancers). \n\nI recommend this place 100% and I will definitely be back, now that I know what kind of vibe they put into their service of Mexican fast-food classics! \n\nYes, Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Quesadillas; that is Mexican Fast Food.

It might take me a little while to catch up on everyone's reviews...as well as my own!\n\nAs one of the only SF taquerias I've ever seen advertise on TV, El Toro, to me, has always been a little different from their competitors in the Mission.  Which, sadly to say, hasn't always been a good thing.  While I appreciate how they're generally cleaner, both in terms of the food as well as the restaurant itself, they're not quite as good as several of their more well known and popular brethren.\n\n-- FIESTA PLATE - Nachos, Garlic Prawns, Chicken Flauta, Corn Quesadilla, Grilled Onions, Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Salsa...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-toro-taqueria-san-francisco#p5hBTUEXwKbPRsb89oBHIg)\nWe ordered this \"appetizer\" to share, but it was practically an entree (we had leftovers).

The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful, while the prawns were fine, albeit heavy on the butter.  Sadly, despite the nice char on it, the Carne Asada was tough and chewy.\n\nWhile I appreciate how El Toro tries to keep their food (relatively) healthier, I can't say I'm a fan of their set-up.  While some items (like their prawns) are cooked to order, others (like the flautas) are just reheated in a microwave.  I assume there's a reason why, but even if their food turns over decently quick (the line is steady), it's certainly not the \"freshest\" way of doing it.\n\nSince I didn't really get to try one of their burritos, it's entirely possible I'm rating El Toro for the wrong things.  At the very least, they seem to be the most popular menu item.

The GrubHub rep said she explained to El Toro how this would be confusing to the ordering customer, and said the El Toro staff was rude to her and actually hung up on her...so she was crediting us $10 instead of $6.30.

All meats, from Al Pastor, to carne asada, to chicken are all full of flavor making the simple taco a true treat.\nThe line may be long but, its totally worth it especially if there are Mariachi inside waiting to serenade you while you drink an ice-cold Coke and eat more tacos than you can count on your fingers... Don't worry, it won't break the bank either.\nThank you El Toro for being closer than Tijuana.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-09-19"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the two carnitas taco dinner with a diet coke.

I thought the flavor was a little off putting, but I could be wrong, it has happened before. The al pastor on the other hand was unarguably flavorless. It looked so good! I felt sheepish (that's right, sheepish) because I always tout this as my standby, can't-go-wrong taco shop meat, but they managed to make it look amazing, but without any flavor. That takes serious skizillz! We were all unanimous in our displeasure with that one. \n\nThe carnitas, on the other hand, were fantastic! I was speechless. With the possible exception of carne asada, this is the most difficult meat for a taco shop to do correctly. They nailed it.

It was not that inedible deep fried crap that some places serve and not that flavorless mushy mess that other places try to pass off. Very, very good. \n\nMy sister liked the tofu taco.

Although burritos preference is a highly subjective (and often sensitive) topic to Missionites, El Toro has arguably been one of the better burrito joints in S.F., with its wide variety of grilled and stewed meats, as well as several vegetarian options. Until recently, El Toro use to offer only two salsa varieties - a red or green.  Both were exceptional. The green was a snappy verde salsa great with crispy carnitas, and the other a red sauce with a perfect chipotle kick to it - just remarkable!  \n\nSince reopening its doors after a recent remodel, something here has changed.  On a recent visit, I ordered my usual Super Burrito, only this time the al pastor (marinated pork) lacked its zing and the pork was rather dry and chewy. Shredded cheese was added more sparingly then before, and the burritos were over-laden with Mexican rice (albeit tasty rice, but way too much filler).  With the addition of the new salsa bar now comes more salsa options, however both salsas that I once so dearly loved are now gone, and the new replacements are not as exceptional as they were prior to the closure.  \n\nI'm sure I'll give it another try in hopes that this was only an \"off\" night and that perhaps they'll  bring back their old red salsa recipe ...please????", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-06-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the super burrito with lengua (tongue) and a horchata.

That's it.\n\nSure enough, we did split the $6.25 Super Vegetarian Burrito, quite an aluminum-foiled monstrosity that more than served us. However, before that, I spent an inordinate amount of time at their large salsa bar (see photo) where I innocently picked up one of the grilled jalape\u00f1o peppers....or was it a haba\u00f1ero? I took one bite and was on fire for about fifteen minutes looking like Albert Brooks in \"Broadcast News\". While I was perspiring profusely, an offensively aromatic vagrant kept walking by our table and yelling at us. Homophobic rant? No, just unhinged and urine-marinaded. I pointed him to the peppers and told him he'd love them if he took a few and chewed on them hard.\n\nWas that mean? Urban living has made me a cynical bastard, I guess. Once I recovered, I was able to enjoy the half-burrito. Packed with flavor, it has all the traditional ingredients but good, solid quality - rice, black beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomato and tomato salsa (see photo). We'll probably come back here before going to Pancho Villa simply because it's not nearly as crowded and of relatively equal caliber when it comes to senseless burrito gorging. Besides, the seafood options and the Ceasar (sic) salad selections all sound pretty good to me. But I sure hope I don't run into that vagrant. He may have a grilled jalapeno with my name on it.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...pretty solid veggie burrito with solid ingredients\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...relatively clean and low-key compared to a lot of other taquerias in the neighborhood\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast but not terribly engaged\nTOTAL - 4 stars...avoid the big grilled peppers in the salsa bar, and you'll be just fine", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I love how they have a side bar for more salsa for you to get!  \n\n"], "author": "Tiffany D.", "review": "Proportions of entrees, nachos and tacos are fillers!

I thought the flavor was a little off putting, but I could be wrong, it has happened before. The al pastor on the other hand was unarguably flavorless. It looked so good! I felt sheepish (that's right, sheepish) because I always tout this as my standby, can't-go-wrong taco shop meat, but they managed to make it look amazing, but without any flavor. That takes serious skizillz! We were all unanimous in our displeasure with that one. \n\nThe carnitas, on the other hand, were fantastic! I was speechless. With the possible exception of carne asada, this is the most difficult meat for a taco shop to do correctly. They nailed it. It was tender, flavorful, and mildly smokey, but they also roasted it just crispy enough. It was not that inedible deep fried crap that some places serve and not that flavorless mushy mess that other places try to pass off. Very, very good. \n\nMy sister liked the tofu taco.

I didn't see her package the final product but immediately opened up the bag to see what she had made.

She then asked if what I was looking for was a flauta..mind you, if you look up a the menu, the description for their flautas was \"three chicken taquitos\". I said no, because flautas are traditionally made with flour tortillas and I wanted three rolled tacos made out of corn tortillas. She replied that their flautas were indeed made with corn tortillas.

Although burritos preference is a highly subjective (and often sensitive) topic to Missionites, El Toro has arguably been one of the better burrito joints in S.F., with its wide variety of grilled and stewed meats, as well as several vegetarian options. Until recently, El Toro use to offer only two salsa varieties - a red or green.  Both were exceptional. The green was a snappy verde salsa great with crispy carnitas, and the other a red sauce with a perfect chipotle kick to it - just remarkable!  \n\nSince reopening its doors after a recent remodel, something here has changed.  On a recent visit, I ordered my usual Super Burrito, only this time the al pastor (marinated pork) lacked its zing and the pork was rather dry and chewy. Shredded cheese was added more sparingly then before, and the burritos were over-laden with Mexican rice (albeit tasty rice, but way too much filler).  With the addition of the new salsa bar now comes more salsa options, however both salsas that I once so dearly loved are now gone, and the new replacements are not as exceptional as they were prior to the closure.  \n\nI'm sure I'll give it another try in hopes that this was only an \"off\" night and that perhaps they'll  bring back their old red salsa recipe ...please????", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-06-03"}, {"excerpts": ["burrito (first time ever had that), with whole wheat tortilla, black beans, extra guac instead of cheese and sour cream (who needs all that heart-clogging moo), and his  is one of the best mo.fu.

I didn't try the prawns since they were the same as my entree's, but I thought the nachos were pretty good.  The flauta was a little disappointing though - decent flavor, but not the least bit crispy (more on that later).\n\n-- DINNER COMBO #5 - Carne Asada, Chicken Asada, and Prawns...$11.00\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-toro-taqueria-san-francisco#qJwneJXKtQYnsCwlxIN1ZA)\nOkay overall, with a plus (Chicken Asada), meh (Prawns), and miss (Carne Asada).  The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful, while the prawns were fine, albeit heavy on the butter.  Sadly, despite the nice char on it, the Carne Asada was tough and chewy.\n\nWhile I appreciate how El Toro tries to keep their food (relatively) healthier, I can't say I'm a fan of their set-up.  While some items (like their prawns) are cooked to order, others (like the flautas) are just reheated in a microwave.  I assume there's a reason why, but even if their food turns over decently quick (the line is steady), it's certainly not the \"freshest\" way of doing it.\n\nSince I didn't really get to try one of their burritos, it's entirely possible I'm rating El Toro for the wrong things.  At the very least, they seem to be the most popular menu item.  Still, despite having the best intentions, the food just can't compare with what you can find elsewhere in the neighborhood.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-04-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The guacamole has chopped tomatoes in it.

She then asked if what I was looking for was a flauta..mind you, if you look up a the menu, the description for their flautas was \"three chicken taquitos\". I said no, because flautas are traditionally made with flour tortillas and I wanted three rolled tacos made out of corn tortillas. She replied that their flautas were indeed made with corn tortillas.

Same happy hour, $1 tacos, $2 beers, great special!\n\nUnfortunately, the food is just okay. I've been here a couple of times now and have sampled pretty much all of the meats. The spicy chicken is like a boiled chicken in an orange-colored sauce that is actually really delicious. I normally am not a fan of this type of thing, but it turns out pretty well. The pollo asado was pretty good too, but was under-seasoned on my second visit. Otherwise though, not too dry, pretty good flavor. \n\nThe carne asada was really bad in my opinion. both of my brothers said it was their faves, but they are somewhat less experienced in these sorts of things than myself. That being said, for people that are not looking for serious authentic carne asada flavor and just want a decent steak taco, it is probably pretty good. I thought the flavor was a little off putting, but I could be wrong, it has happened before. The al pastor on the other hand was unarguably flavorless. It looked so good! I felt sheepish (that's right, sheepish) because I always tout this as my standby, can't-go-wrong taco shop meat, but they managed to make it look amazing, but without any flavor. That takes serious skizillz! We were all unanimous in our displeasure with that one. \n\nThe carnitas, on the other hand, were fantastic! I was speechless. With the possible exception of carne asada, this is the most difficult meat for a taco shop to do correctly. They nailed it. It was tender, flavorful, and mildly smokey, but they also roasted it just crispy enough. It was not that inedible deep fried crap that some places serve and not that flavorless mushy mess that other places try to pass off. Very, very good. \n\nMy sister liked the tofu taco. I tried the fish taco, which was good for what it is, but it is definitely not baja style (read: not fried, no white sauce, no cabbage, etc.). Tasty though. My mom also liked the veggie burrito, but did admit that it was pretty bland by itself and needed lots of salsa. Which creates a fortunate segue into talking about their phenomenal salsa bar.

A gawky, lanky, adolescent girl frequented El Toro at least once a week with her mom who lived just up the street on 17th and Dearborn. This was back in the days before the Mission was filled with hipsters, bars and restaurants. In fact, it was a bit scary back in '86. My memories include my mom and I getting harassed on the way to and from the BART station and the big neon 500 and martini glass sign at the corner of 17th and Guerrero represented a scary business to keep away from because of all the scary drunks that hung out in front of it. Oh how the Mission has changed. \n\nI would come down from Oregon during the summer and stay in the big city of SF with my mom and during the summer of 1986 I developed a crush on a particular burrito 'slinger' at El Toro. I managed to convince my mom to go there for dinner so I could eat a chicken burrito lovingly made by my wannabe novio. My mom knew about my crush and indulged me as much as she could afford, which was a lot, because back in 1986 the burrito prices topped out at $3.50. Definitely something a single mom could afford. \n\nFast forward to June 13, 2008. I had an itching for Mission-style burritos and my first thought was El Toro. I knew it was still around from the Yelp reviews so my husband and I went to the city to check it out - 22 years later. \n\nHere are the things that have changed: \nPrices - 1986 =$3.50 - 2008 = $8.50\nIngredients - you would never see tofu as a burrito filling in 1986\nAtmosphere - the inside has clearly been upgraded - complete with new tiles and facade. \nClientele - 1986 - my mom and I were one of the few Caucasians in the joint; mostly Spanish spoken. 2008 = lots of Mission hipsters; lots of yoga mats and bicycles. \nFood - honestly, it was like taking a bite back in time.

The tofu comes diced in cubes with a tomato based sauce.

The chips were thin and toasted right, they are unsalted. The guacamole was authentic, too mashed for my liking but good nonetheless, it could have used more lime, I also added salt.

It might take me a little while to catch up on everyone's reviews...as well as my own!\n\nAs one of the only SF taquerias I've ever seen advertise on TV, El Toro, to me, has always been a little different from their competitors in the Mission.  Which, sadly to say, hasn't always been a good thing.  While I appreciate how they're generally cleaner, both in terms of the food as well as the restaurant itself, they're not quite as good as several of their more well known and popular brethren.\n\n-- FIESTA PLATE - Nachos, Garlic Prawns, Chicken Flauta, Corn Quesadilla, Grilled Onions, Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Salsa...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-toro-taqueria-san-francisco#p5hBTUEXwKbPRsb89oBHIg)\nWe ordered this \"appetizer\" to share, but it was practically an entree (we had leftovers).  I didn't try the prawns since they were the same as my entree's, but I thought the nachos were pretty good.  The flauta was a little disappointing though - decent flavor, but not the least bit crispy (more on that later).\n\n-- DINNER COMBO #5 - Carne Asada, Chicken Asada, and Prawns...$11.00\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-toro-taqueria-san-francisco#qJwneJXKtQYnsCwlxIN1ZA)\nOkay overall, with a plus (Chicken Asada), meh (Prawns), and miss (Carne Asada).  The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful, while the prawns were fine, albeit heavy on the butter.  Sadly, despite the nice char on it, the Carne Asada was tough and chewy.\n\nWhile I appreciate how El Toro tries to keep their food (relatively) healthier, I can't say I'm a fan of their set-up.  While some items (like their prawns) are cooked to order, others (like the flautas) are just reheated in a microwave.  I assume there's a reason why, but even if their food turns over decently quick (the line is steady), it's certainly not the \"freshest\" way of doing it.\n\nSince I didn't really get to try one of their burritos, it's entirely possible I'm rating El Toro for the wrong things.  At the very least, they seem to be the most popular menu item.
