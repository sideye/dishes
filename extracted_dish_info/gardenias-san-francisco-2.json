"], "author": "Shannon N.", "review": "I had never made it to Woodward's Garden, but it was my old man's go to spot.  He was sad when it closed, but so happy when he got wind of the new spot and concept.  So, we were dying to go.\n\nI did some sleuthing about when it was finally LIVE.  They are only open right now Thurs-Mon for dinner, with a last seating at 8pm, so we took a Monday 8pm spot via Opentable.  The patio looks great, but they are still waiting on the permit for it so, stay tuned.\n\nThe space is sleek and clean, with tables and a lovely eat at counter.  Lots of walk in opportunities.  We had a table with our reservation, but opted for the counter as it is my old man's preference.  It wasn't too crowded, so we were able to chat with the staff and have some fun.  It feels like a place where that will be the norm, even when it is slammed.\n\nOnce seated, Margie came over and brought us menus.  The food is always going to change based on availability, but there are a few staples.  We started with the cucumber gazpacho and a seasonal veggie plate.  The gazpacho was mine, and lovely.  It was a punch of cucumber flavor, with some kick (jalapeno), and these great radish bits too cool off the heat.  The old man had the veggies, but kindly shared them - they were earthy and fresh, and such a warm (as in comforting) way to start our meals.  Dinner was: the wheat berry risotto for him and the braised short ribs for me.  I sadly forgot to try his, but he said it was creamy, filling and yet still light.  My ribs were beautiful cooked and seasoned, but the polenta they were on: I wanted to bathe in it.  It was a different texture than most, but it complemented the ribs perfectly, and the flavor off the charts.\n\nWe were more than full - the portions are what I would call perfect, not tiny waif-like, but not middle-american gluttonous.  But, early in the meal, I saw the olive oil cake go by, so that was happening.  My olive oil cake was really special.  All the lightness and texture that such cakes are marked by, and none of the over-powering nuttiness they can have in less skilled hands.  The old man got the chocolate raspberry tart, and it was so delicate.  The chocolate is an underneath lawyer, so I forgot it was there until I bit into it, and it balanced the raspberry tartness perfectly.  \n\nThe whole meal set us back about $86 (and I had wine), which in SF for 3 courses x 2 people plus wine for me, is really quite a treat.  The old man is already set for dessert date there this week, and dinner next.  So, that should tell you it is up to snuff.  \n\nAnd, though I never went to Woodward's Garden, I could appreciate very easily and straight away why people love Margie so much, and why the place had so many loyal folks.  When we were there, she was all about the place, doing everything from clearing plates to giving advice.  She told us how much she loved the new spot, and how happy she is; I think that comes through pretty clearly with everything we enjoyed.

We sat at the chef's counter.  Point #1: if you expose your kitchen to your customers you **MUST** have your sh*t together.  Otherwise it is like dining at your friends' house, as they teeter on the brink of divorce.\n\nOur first server was a sweet french(?) girl who unknowingly traded off duties with another server who looked less than thrilled to be there.  They were the only two designated servers, but there was someone who appeared to be ab expediter who was also on the floor.  Two line cooks were behind the bar and communication among all parties was a hot mess.  Our gazpacho came in a timely fashion, and like I said, it was delicious.\n\nOur two small plates, crudite and little gems salad seemed to be taking an awfully long time so server #1 checked in, saying they were on their way.  After another 15 minutes and checking with server #2, the little gems that we saw sitting on the counter for 20 minutes arrived to us, along with the vegetables.  Meanwhile, we could SEE that our entrees had been fired and were ready to be served at that time, so off to the heating rack they went, to dry out for 10 minutes.  \n\nIn a hurried frenzy the small plates were cleared and our mains were there, hot hot plates and all.  I had the pork shoulder which had dried out a bit after sitting around.  My husband had the guinea hen, which we both thought would be an actual guinea hen.  Maybe it was 1/3 of a guinea hen, which is like, 2 bites.  And it was accompanied by 1.5 halves of potatoes.  Not worth $27.\n\nI get it.  Accidents happen.  But the couple next to us seemed to have a similar issue.  The owners are restaurant veterans, so I have a hard time seeing how they can let their establishment run like this on a Saturday night.  And like I said, if your kitchen is visible to your customers, don't mess up, and if you do, re-fire those mains and fix your mistakes.  And don't let your customers see the eye-rolling, the huffing and puffing, the stress, and the discord.  It's just not pleasant.  AND if you mess up, comp SOMETHING.  ANYTHING.

Our reservation was at 7:30 p.m. We showed up five minutes late, but typically a restaurant will hold your reservation for 15 minutes before giving it away, so we weren't worried. The location of G is lovely, tucked away in a tree-covered neighborhood on Sutter. I had actually learned about G from just walking to and from work. \n\nThe food, in my opinion, was spectacular. For starters, we ordered the peas and ricotta on crostini, the calamari, and the beet ravioli - they were all special dishes. The peas and ricotta on crostini was probably my favorite - the flavors worked well together and all of the ingredients were noticeably fresh. The calamari was also outstanding, grilled perfectly and served with a perfect amount of heat, it did not disappoint. The beet ravioli was also lovely, with fresh flavors and parmesan cheese, I could have probably eaten 8 more ravioli by myself (the serving size is 2 ravioli). I asked for bread and butter, which by the way, costs $3.50 (only in San Francisco do you pay for bread and butter). \n\nBefore I continue raving about the food, I want to again note that we had a reservation for two people at 7:30 p.m. Our reservation was not honored, and it was not okay. When we walked in and told the host/server we had a reservation, he said that it would be 20 minutes. What? Why? We could have walked in off the street and waited 20 minutes. Because we were in good moods and didn't want to let this rather large oversight spoil the evening (or our anniversary), we took a seat at the bar (where, we were informed, we could also enjoy dinner), and ordered some beer (beer and wine only) and some starters. Over an hour later, at 8:40 p.m., we still had not been seated at a table. I flagged down our server and asked to speak with the manager, WHICH I NEVER DO. She came over, and when I expressed to her how disappointed I was that our reservation was not honored, she did not seem to care. In fact, she didn't even apologize for making us wait for over an hour for a table despite the fact that we had made the reservation far in advance. She just said it was busy and shrugged. We would have left, but we wondered where we could go with no reservation on a Saturday night in San Francisco. \n\nWe were then seated at a table, finally. The server came up to us and asked if we wanted to order dessert. What? We hadn't even ordered entrees yet. We ordered dinner, which was also incredibly yummy. For him, the short ribs. For me, the pesto fettuccini and the seared scallops (both small plates because I'm indecisive). I loved both of my dishes, and my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e was outrageously tasty. \n\nOur bill came and nothing on the bill was taken care of. I wasn't really looking for G to do that, but it would have been a nice gesture, considering the poor service we received. I don't think I'll be back to G's. It's a shame, because I love the food, but they have got to get their act together. Don't take reservations if you can't handle them.

All four of us had a lovely time at dinner -- the ambiance is casual, the service attentive, patient and warm. The food was excellent at times and other plates were less than stellar. That, however, did not detract from the overall joy of the meal with good friends: delightful comfort food, enjoyable service, neighborhood-y spot -- can't ask for much more in SF of 2016, which has changed almost beyond comprehension in the 26 years since I first moved here.\n\nWe had early reservations for a Friday night: 6pm. The restaurant was empty and we were given our choice of table -- a great start! When was the last time you got to pick your seating on a Friday night? We started with bright and creamy castelvetrano olives and each ordered our own glasses of wine. Our server, a sweet Spanish girl, knew the wine list and made good recommendations. We explained that we wanted to try many plates and to share everything -- she assured us that the portion sizes would be just right to do so. Perfect! \n\nThe timing of the food was great -- she would bring 2-3 plates at once and allow us our unhurried taste of this, the passing of that plate, back and forth -- none of this forcing more plates onto an already full tabletop to ensure the table was turned over quickly. In the almost 3 hours we were there, we were never rushed, never ignored. Our server was friendly, knowledgable and warm throughout -- even though the restaurant became very full and very busy within an hour of our arrival. \n\nWe started with the artichoke small plate -- it was fine, but not mind blowing. Maybe it would be better a little later in the season? The vegetables with bagna cauda were \"meh\" for me. The veggies were fresh and good -- tricolor carrots, baby fennel, celery, watermelon radish -- but the bagna cauda was not well blended and so just ended up being dipping oil for fresh veggies. Could have done without either of these small plates.\n\nNow the ricotta raviolo was AH-MAZING! The pasta was made with some type of whole grain -- don't know what it was, maybe spelt? Delicious and hearty on the outside, creamy and melty on the inside. Definitely large enough for all 4 of us to share: each got a huge bite. YUM! We got a blood orange salad to share -- the flavors were there but the blood orange should have been segmented more finely, and the nuts chopped more delicately. This is nitpicky stuff, people! Order it anyway, it was a fine counterpoint to the richness of the raviolo. We ended the small plates with the seared scallops -- a hit! I had imagine 2 large scallops that we'd have to cut into small pieces but we got 5-6 scallops on a delicious bed of lentils. Perfection!\n\nFinally, we ordered 2 entrees to split: The falling-off-the-bone duck leg and the savory-sweet-fennel-y short ribs. I could eat those short ribs for days! Both entrees were hearty, flavorful and really hit the spot for a chilly spring evening! \n\nWe were satiated but still ordered dessert because it's our custom.

Our reservation was at 7:30 p.m. We showed up five minutes late, but typically a restaurant will hold your reservation for 15 minutes before giving it away, so we weren't worried. The location of G is lovely, tucked away in a tree-covered neighborhood on Sutter. I had actually learned about G from just walking to and from work. \n\nThe food, in my opinion, was spectacular. For starters, we ordered the peas and ricotta on crostini, the calamari, and the beet ravioli - they were all special dishes. The peas and ricotta on crostini was probably my favorite - the flavors worked well together and all of the ingredients were noticeably fresh. The calamari was also outstanding, grilled perfectly and served with a perfect amount of heat, it did not disappoint. The beet ravioli was also lovely, with fresh flavors and parmesan cheese, I could have probably eaten 8 more ravioli by myself (the serving size is 2 ravioli). I asked for bread and butter, which by the way, costs $3.50 (only in San Francisco do you pay for bread and butter). \n\nBefore I continue raving about the food, I want to again note that we had a reservation for two people at 7:30 p.m. Our reservation was not honored, and it was not okay. When we walked in and told the host/server we had a reservation, he said that it would be 20 minutes. What? Why? We could have walked in off the street and waited 20 minutes. Because we were in good moods and didn't want to let this rather large oversight spoil the evening (or our anniversary), we took a seat at the bar (where, we were informed, we could also enjoy dinner), and ordered some beer (beer and wine only) and some starters. Over an hour later, at 8:40 p.m., we still had not been seated at a table. I flagged down our server and asked to speak with the manager, WHICH I NEVER DO. She came over, and when I expressed to her how disappointed I was that our reservation was not honored, she did not seem to care. In fact, she didn't even apologize for making us wait for over an hour for a table despite the fact that we had made the reservation far in advance. She just said it was busy and shrugged. We would have left, but we wondered where we could go with no reservation on a Saturday night in San Francisco. \n\nWe were then seated at a table, finally. The server came up to us and asked if we wanted to order dessert. What? We hadn't even ordered entrees yet. We ordered dinner, which was also incredibly yummy. For him, the short ribs. For me, the pesto fettuccini and the seared scallops (both small plates because I'm indecisive). I loved both of my dishes, and my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e was outrageously tasty. \n\nOur bill came and nothing on the bill was taken care of. I wasn't really looking for G to do that, but it would have been a nice gesture, considering the poor service we received. I don't think I'll be back to G's. It's a shame, because I love the food, but they have got to get their act together. Don't take reservations if you can't handle them.

It was a different texture than most, but it complemented the ribs perfectly, and the flavor off the charts.\n\nWe were more than full - the portions are what I would call perfect, not tiny waif-like, but not middle-american gluttonous.  But, early in the meal, I saw the olive oil cake go by, so that was happening.  My olive oil cake was really special.  All the lightness and texture that such cakes are marked by, and none of the over-powering nuttiness they can have in less skilled hands.  The old man got the chocolate raspberry tart, and it was so delicate.  The chocolate is an underneath lawyer, so I forgot it was there until I bit into it, and it balanced the raspberry tartness perfectly.  \n\nThe whole meal set us back about $86 (and I had wine), which in SF for 3 courses x 2 people plus wine for me, is really quite a treat.  The old man is already set for dessert date there this week, and dinner next.  So, that should tell you it is up to snuff.  \n\nAnd, though I never went to Woodward's Garden, I could appreciate very easily and straight away why people love Margie so much, and why the place had so many loyal folks.  When we were there, she was all about the place, doing everything from clearing plates to giving advice.  She told us how much she loved the new spot, and how happy she is; I think that comes through pretty clearly with everything we enjoyed.

The current menu could use a few tweaks, as could the service which was extremely friendly if a bit harried.  \nTwo of us had five items of varying sizes and while everything was delicious, it was a bit one note.  Again, I'll stress that we enjoyed all of it (though didn't finish any of the larger items).  I just wish there was a bit of variation in flavors and some lighter options.  The current menu (not the one on the website) is on the heavier side with a very fall/winter feel to it.  I greatly appreciate seasonality, but a little acid somewhere in our meal would have gone a long way.  \nI am currently eating my leftover squash crepes for breakfast and I feel exactly the same as when I had them for dinner - delicious but just a little too heavy and sweet.
