The owner, Ken, is quite friendly and converses with everyone.  Seems like they host a great deal of school sports teams parties from the nearby schools.

We like all the variety of pizzas they have to offer. The Eagle meat/deluxe combo is good, with lots of flavorable and tender meats. The gourmet vegetarian has all the veggies we like including artichoke hearts. We also like the clambake and request for just mozzarella cheese, and no cheddar cheese on that. And the margherita cheese and tomato is very good. The extra large pizza is a generous size. I like that the crust is thin and crisp on the bottom and the crust on the edges, is lightly crisp on the outside and light and tender on the inside - like a good French bread. Prices are reasonable and you are bound to have leftovers. The antipasto salad is delicious and I highly recommend it.  Comfortable and casual interior. Nice selection of beers in bottles and on tap.
