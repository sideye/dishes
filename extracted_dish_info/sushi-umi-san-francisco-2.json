I particularly liked that they have rolls of various sizes (this is probably pretty common, but I don't notice it a lot), so I had an 8 piece complex roll but then a 4 piece small veggie roll.\nToday I ate downstairs at the sushi boats, and it was awesome! My friend and I went and each had one piece of every roll we tried then split the cost at the end (definitely recommend this as the way to go). Every roll was tried was delicious. Some of the rolls on the boats had clearly been out for a little while, but the chefs were actively adding fresh rolls to the boats, so all of the sushi we ate was fresh.
