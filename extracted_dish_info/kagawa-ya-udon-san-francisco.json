I feel full after eating Orenchi ramen where their main ramen is priced around $13. This is not the case for this place, their portions barely makes me full. The tempura prices are alright.\n\nSo until they start pricing their niku udon around 8 to 9 dollars and their kitsune around $6 I am not going back. I'm okay if they keep their price but double the portions that is also acceptable. If you're feeling like eating Udon, pack instant kitsune udon from nijiya priced around $1/$2 and skip this place. I guarantee, if they keep their price and portions of today, they'll be out of business in around 6 months.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'll change the review if they wake up and realize they're not in the ramen business.

Udon is one of my favorite foods, and to have smacked right on Market Street makes it even better. I was very excited to try out Kagawa-Ya, and I came here on a weekday evening with a friend to satisfy my hunger for udon. I was expecting it to be really crowded here since it's smacked right in the middle of where all the tech companies are and we came during dinner hours but was surprised when it was at 20% capacity. The good thing about that was that we got to choose our seats, and we decided to sit on the stools by the window peering outside. \n\nWe then went up to the line and ordered our respective udon dishes. I decided to go for the Beef Curry Udon and for the tempura I got the sweet egg tempura, vegetable fritter, and the curry potato. They have a wide selection of tempura and I like how you're able to just choose one of whatever tempura you want instead of having multiple of the same tempura. I sampled the beef curry udon first and was very pleased with my choice, as the curry tasted fantastic and the tender beef just falls apart once I bit into it. What I like even more than the beef personally was the potatoes, and curry is always better with potatoes. One thing about the curry udon is that it wasn't as thick as I would have liked, and this was honestly more personal preference than anything. I moved onto the tempura next, and I started with the sweet egg tempura. I think the sweet egg tempura was alright, but to be honest, I never had a sweet egg tempura before, and I think it's more likely that I just don't like sweet eggs as a tempura in general. The vegetable fritter, on the other hand, was to my liking, and it was pretty crunchy and was a nice meld of vegetables. However, my favorite tempura was the curry potato, since it had a soft crusty exterior and a very soft interior. The curry flavor wasn't strong in the curry potato, but that could be because I was eating the beef curry udon at the same time, which probably overwhelmed the subtle curry flavor in the curry potato. Nevertheless, I felt very satisfied with the curry potato.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with the meal, and I really like how they gave a generous helping of beef and potatoes with the udon. One thing about the price is, it's actually more than what I would expect to pay for udon, and the curry udon alone was $14. I can somewhat justify this since there were very generous portions of udon, and I did feel really bloated after eating it. I would definitely come back here again, and I could see myself ordering the Creamy Kabocha with Chicken Udon, or the Cream of Clam & Leeks Udon the next time I come here.

An fresh udon bar with selections of tempura and yakimomo (pan-fried appetizers). In essence, I think Kagawa-Ya achieved that but San Francisco ruined this one for me. First off, the location is slightly unappealing. While it is in SOMA, close to Uber HQ and Twitter HQ, the neighborhood around it makes me uncomfortable to walk around at night (near Civic Center/Tenderloin). That said, the inside of the restaurant looks clean and modern. The quality and flavor here was mediocre in comparison to what I have had before, lackluster and oversalted at its worst. \n\nYou line up at first to select from their preset menu of udon styles (warm soup, cold udon).

I really like properly-made Japanese tempura, which seems to be so hard to find in the SF Bay Area.  I guess compared to the average Japanese restaurant, the tempura here is alright. But again, not as fresh tasting or light as the restaurant in Oahu, Hawaii. \n\nI will say two of their udon soups were more inventive, going for fusion flavors like cream of clam and leek udon, and spicy tomato udon with roasted shiitake. I was quite excited when I saw them and ended up choosing the cream of clam and leek broth. One thing that I definitely surprised me was that the quality of their udon noodles was very underwhelming. It honestly tasted like frozen udon noodles from Japan. It didn't have the nice bouncy al dente texture and freshness from homemade udon, which it actually really quite nice and more alkaline. I don't know where their udon is made or sourced, but they didn't have a noodle chef making it and it also didn't taste homemade to me. \n\nNow onto the broth. I'm going to be honest, I might be more harsh and critical about broth and taste because I often cook Japanese food at home, eat out at mostly Japanese restaurants, and have stayed in Japan for 2 weeks recently. I expected the broth to taste light, clean, ungreasy and well-balanced. It was the exact opposite of that. The clam and leek broth was oversalted, heavy and did not have a single clam in it! It makes me wonder if they used clam juice/clams in a bottle instead of real clams cooked down. The broth did not have depth and was overly heavy. I couldn't finish my dish, which is actually REALLY rare for me.  My husband ordered the classic niku (beef) udon, which was slightly better. However, it too was oversalted and lacked depth and complexity. For the price of about ~$15-18 per bowl of udon, I was pretty disappointed. The spam musubi was pretty standard and nothing to write home about. Because the tempura was lukewarm, fried in a bad batter, it tasted greasy a lack of crispy texture. Tempura, when done well, does a great job at highlighting the freshness of the vegetables, which was not executed well here. \n\nOverall, it was not a pleasant experience. While seating was plentiful and clean, the environment felt sterile. It reminded me a dormitory cafeteria but without the liveliness and chatter of a college campus. The food was mediocre- broth, noodles AND tempura. I know I am a food snob when it comes to Japanese food, so I understand that my review is low and disagrees with others. That being said, I think even if you do not eat Japanese food much, there are still better options for udon in San Francisco. Maybe they are a bit further, but they'll be a better bang for your wallet and it will taste noticeably better. \n\nI will try to come back next year to see if there was been improvement.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Their cold udon already has a broth in it ", "so it's not dipping like you'd imagine.

I like the potato and curry potato croquette. But other good ones include a veggie medly patty, pumpkin slice, and zucchini fan. The spam musubi and onigiri are $3 each. Pretty good portion and tasty. I like the kitsune udon best because it's savory and I can add tempura without feeling guilty. The cold udon comes with an egg and has a clean, simple taste. Niku udon has tons of beef. I can eat this one without adding tempura. Creamy kobocha is okay. Tastes buttery, creamy. The tomato udon reminded me of red pasta sauce. Not bad, but not my favorite. Interesting to try. Overall - you line up to order, pay for your order, find a place to sit, which isn't hard because the turnover is pretty high for this casual lunch spot. Clean digs.

"], "author": "Nelson X.", "review": "You know, I can't believe my unbelievable luck of having two new udon places open up in SF during the past year. Udon is one of my favorite foods, and to have smacked right on Market Street makes it even better. I was very excited to try out Kagawa-Ya, and I came here on a weekday evening with a friend to satisfy my hunger for udon. I was expecting it to be really crowded here since it's smacked right in the middle of where all the tech companies are and we came during dinner hours but was surprised when it was at 20% capacity. The good thing about that was that we got to choose our seats, and we decided to sit on the stools by the window peering outside. \n\nWe then went up to the line and ordered our respective udon dishes. I decided to go for the Beef Curry Udon and for the tempura I got the sweet egg tempura, vegetable fritter, and the curry potato. They have a wide selection of tempura and I like how you're able to just choose one of whatever tempura you want instead of having multiple of the same tempura. I sampled the beef curry udon first and was very pleased with my choice, as the curry tasted fantastic and the tender beef just falls apart once I bit into it. What I like even more than the beef personally was the potatoes, and curry is always better with potatoes. One thing about the curry udon is that it wasn't as thick as I would have liked, and this was honestly more personal preference than anything. I moved onto the tempura next, and I started with the sweet egg tempura. I think the sweet egg tempura was alright, but to be honest, I never had a sweet egg tempura before, and I think it's more likely that I just don't like sweet eggs as a tempura in general. The vegetable fritter, on the other hand, was to my liking, and it was pretty crunchy and was a nice meld of vegetables. However, my favorite tempura was the curry potato, since it had a soft crusty exterior and a very soft interior. The curry flavor wasn't strong in the curry potato, but that could be because I was eating the beef curry udon at the same time, which probably overwhelmed the subtle curry flavor in the curry potato. Nevertheless, I felt very satisfied with the curry potato.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with the meal, and I really like how they gave a generous helping of beef and potatoes with the udon. One thing about the price is, it's actually more than what I would expect to pay for udon, and the curry udon alone was $14. I can somewhat justify this since there were very generous portions of udon, and I did feel really bloated after eating it. I would definitely come back here again, and I could see myself ordering the Creamy Kabocha with Chicken Udon, or the Cream of Clam & Leeks Udon the next time I come here. As an aside, I wish they had more cold udon options besides the regular Cold Udon, and hopefully, they would expand their repertoire of cold udon. Other than that, I would highly recommend Kagawa-Ya for anyone with a craving for good udon in SF.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-04-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We tried the Creamy Kabocha with Chicken Udon ($11) and Beef Curry Udon ($13).

An fresh udon bar with selections of tempura and yakimomo (pan-fried appetizers). In essence, I think Kagawa-Ya achieved that but San Francisco ruined this one for me. First off, the location is slightly unappealing. While it is in SOMA, close to Uber HQ and Twitter HQ, the neighborhood around it makes me uncomfortable to walk around at night (near Civic Center/Tenderloin). That said, the inside of the restaurant looks clean and modern. The quality and flavor here was mediocre in comparison to what I have had before, lackluster and oversalted at its worst. \n\nYou line up at first to select from their preset menu of udon styles (warm soup, cold udon). After they heat the udon noodles, combine it with broth and toppings, you can take a plate and pick any tempura from a line of selections; ranging from tempura shrimp, carrot, broccoli, curry croquette, spam musubi etc. This style of serving is very similar to Marukame Udon. Overall, the style is similar but the price is 2x as expensive as its counter part in Hawaii. In comparison, the tempura here was poorly made, lukewarm (not nice and piping hot, freshly fried), oily and very heavy to the palate. I really like properly-made Japanese tempura, which seems to be so hard to find in the SF Bay Area.  I guess compared to the average Japanese restaurant, the tempura here is alright. But again, not as fresh tasting or light as the restaurant in Oahu, Hawaii. \n\nI will say two of their udon soups were more inventive, going for fusion flavors like cream of clam and leek udon, and spicy tomato udon with roasted shiitake. I was quite excited when I saw them and ended up choosing the cream of clam and leek broth. One thing that I definitely surprised me was that the quality of their udon noodles was very underwhelming. It honestly tasted like frozen udon noodles from Japan. It didn't have the nice bouncy al dente texture and freshness from homemade udon, which it actually really quite nice and more alkaline. I don't know where their udon is made or sourced, but they didn't have a noodle chef making it and it also didn't taste homemade to me. \n\nNow onto the broth. I'm going to be honest, I might be more harsh and critical about broth and taste because I often cook Japanese food at home, eat out at mostly Japanese restaurants, and have stayed in Japan for 2 weeks recently. I expected the broth to taste light, clean, ungreasy and well-balanced. It was the exact opposite of that. The clam and leek broth was oversalted, heavy and did not have a single clam in it! It makes me wonder if they used clam juice/clams in a bottle instead of real clams cooked down. The broth did not have depth and was overly heavy. I couldn't finish my dish, which is actually REALLY rare for me.  My husband ordered the classic niku (beef) udon, which was slightly better. However, it too was oversalted and lacked depth and complexity. For the price of about ~$15-18 per bowl of udon, I was pretty disappointed. The spam musubi was pretty standard and nothing to write home about. Because the tempura was lukewarm, fried in a bad batter, it tasted greasy a lack of crispy texture. Tempura, when done well, does a great job at highlighting the freshness of the vegetables, which was not executed well here. \n\nOverall, it was not a pleasant experience. While seating was plentiful and clean, the environment felt sterile. It reminded me a dormitory cafeteria but without the liveliness and chatter of a college campus. The food was mediocre- broth, noodles AND tempura. I know I am a food snob when it comes to Japanese food, so I understand that my review is low and disagrees with others. That being said, I think even if you do not eat Japanese food much, there are still better options for udon in San Francisco. Maybe they are a bit further, but they'll be a better bang for your wallet and it will taste noticeably better. \n\nI will try to come back next year to see if there was been improvement.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Spicy Tomato Udon with Roasted Shiitake.
