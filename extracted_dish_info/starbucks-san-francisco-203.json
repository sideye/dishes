Completely and utterly off Starbucks branding expectations! There were 5 workers in their little module and only 2 were actually doing their job. They had a male barista doing all of the drinks while close to about 8-10 customer were waiting for their drinks. As this was taking place, the other 3 female workers were too busy yapping amongst each other. \n\nAt one point, a customer returns their empty milk canister to the cashier and she states \"um, you're supposed to return this to the drink area!\" Oh, that makes perfect sense... give it to the guy who trying to catch up on everyone's drinks so you can continue to chat with another coworker and act like your busy. In addition, why are you correcting a customer about where to leave YOUR empty milk canisters??? \n\nSince the barista was overly busy making drinks, he couldn't even properly refill the canister, but instead hands the customer a cup of milk to be used. Below customer service expectations! I really felt sorry for that kid as he had no back up help whatsoever.\n\nThen as I was leaving, the workers were playing rap music. I'm not against any sort of music but, when you have to abide by a brand such as Starbucks, this is completely unacceptable. This Starbucks in particular has some employees that don't give a crap about work efficiency or their fellow employees that actually do their job. I can't believe what I witnessed all in the 15 minutes to get ONE iced coffee!!! \n\nSomeone needs to visit this location and get rid of the low hanging apples or you're going to keep losing the good ones!
