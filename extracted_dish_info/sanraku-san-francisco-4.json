Whiskey tango foxtrot!\n\nTo add insult to injury, the raw fish nigiri had wasabi spread underneath the pieces of fish (when was the last time that was an acceptable norm??),  the yellowtail was all pulled apart and ugly, the salmon looked a bit off-color on the corners, and the California rolls looked like they came from Safeway.  The vegetarian \"special\" platter was halfway decent, at least, and I must say the eggplant nigiri was rather heavenly.  That was the only thing that impressed me.  Period.\n\nThis is not as I remembered my last trip here!  That was back when I was naive and silly and preferred hot sake to the cold unfiltered...  tisk tisk tisk.  At least the gyoza were somewhat decent.  I came here for sushi, though, dammit, not glorified greasy dumplings.\n\nThe waiter was probably sufficiently embarrassed, and that somehow translated to some dire inattentiveness, I think: he sheepishly realized that he didn't replace our napkins that were used in the cleanup effort for the spilled water, and once our water needed refilling, he had to be flagged down.  He was good about it thereafter, I'll give him that.  This was on top of neglecting to take our order when we were obviously ready (remember, menus closed), however, and he all but disappeared when the time for the check came and went-- I had to go to the counter to request it and after it was brought to our table, I had to take it back to the counter to pay it.  I know you're ashamed, sweetie, but come on, we still exist!  Maybe he was just overworked.  Who knows...  I feel for the poor soul, yet my dissatisfaction unfortunately reigned supreme over my compassion.  That's just the bare truth.\n\nThe last time I was here, I don't remember it being this overpriced (including the unfiltered sake-- $18 for a lackluster bottle!!) or this bad-- and I could have handled the expense if it weren't for the lack of quality.  Next time, I'll pack my dinner or dine elsewhere when I go to the Metreon for my IMAX experience.\n\nAt least THAT (300) was freaking awesome.  My bootlegged Sparks helped.  Maybe I'm snobbier than I used to be, but damn, this just was not a good experience.\n\nThank you.", "rating": 2, "date": "2007-03-25"}, {"excerpts": ["California roll, rainbow roll, phili roll.

In fact, I think just yesterday that I enjoyed perhaps my best meal yet at their restaurant.  \n\nA quick note about my sushi tastes- I prefer nigiri- and usually don't order any rolls, or even look on the menu for them.  I am more interested in trying new and different types (species) of fish than I am in trying different types of creative rolls.  So my user reviews will reflect that.  Anyways, after a movie at the Metreon, we sat at the sushi bar and pummeled about 35+ pieces of nigiri.  Chu-toro- excellent.  Zuke-maguro- excellent. Hamachi belly- excellent. Anago- excellent.  Kanpachi- excellent.  Katsuo- excellent.  We did order the spicy tuna roll and that was tasty as well.  Everything was excellent, tasted very fresh, and was reasonably priced to my expectations- though not cheap- three of us splurged for a $160 bill before tip (no alcohol).  But such are the terms I am accustomed to with my sushi habit.... I enjoyed the great variety of fish they had- perhaps 20+ different options, and they have a fairly extensive non-sushi menu as well for those interested in different options.\n\nPlease note that they have a new 'main' entrance from the exterior of the Metreon building due to the renovation currently going on.  I am used to entering from the interior, however that has been cut-off, and now you must enter from the exterior by the Yerba Buena Gardens.  I was a bit confused about how to find my way in at first, and I hope this has not injured their business.  \n\nAnyways, this place is super convenient and provides sushi of excellent quality.  While I wouldn't classify it as a 'destination' sushi restaurant that I would specifically go to for a dinner/lunch etc, I will consistently patronize them if I am in the area shopping, for a movie, etc. Compares favorably to places such as Ten Ichi on Fillmore or Sushi Bistro.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-18"}, {"excerpts": ["nigiri, negihama (yellowtail with green onions roll, $6.50), and the spicy albacore tataki ($5).  \n\n", "The spicy sauce was weird and seemed more suited for a burger.

Located in the Metreon, the atmosphere is nothing special, but I thought the food, all in all, was pretty good, if a little on the pricey side. They do have an excellent list of top quality sakes, which is always nice, served cold, and generously so, in a masu (a traditional wooden box-shaped cup) in a saucer. They overpour the masu until the saucer is about half-filled; when you've drunk enough to make room in the masu, you can pour what's in the saucer in there.\n\nThe first evening, I had the sunomono, a salad, and nabeyaki soba, which was pleasant enough, but not as good as what you can get at Seto in Sunnyvale, for instance. The sunomono was good, the salad's nothing special, I'd give it a miss. The Akitabare sake was excellent.\n\nThe second evening, a friend who was after Japanese food and I went back and sat at the sushi bar. I had clam misoshiru, tuna zake (maguro marinated in jalapeno-laced sauce, with diced jalapeno bits on it), hotate (Hokkaido scallops), negihamachimaki (yellowtail and scallions roll), and hirame (halibut). These were all excellent, although the maguro gets lost in the jalapeno with the tuna zake. My friend had a set meal with misoshiru, assorted sashimi, and tempura, and reported it to be very good. We both had the Onogoroshi sake--they were sadly out of the Onogoroshi Ginjyo.\n\nService was fine and friendly, I chatted with the itamae in Japanese, I'd go back.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-08-10"}], "eskimo": [{"excerpts": ["the eskimo roll, SF roll, spicy roll, and the katsu-don rice bowl.

All the ingredients tasted fresh, and the portions do not disappoint. It definitely hits the spot when you are craving sushi. \n\nThe katsu don bowl didn't really do it for me. It's fried pork that is coated with eggs, so it's a bit crispy and soggy at the same time. The flavors were great, and they don't skimp out on the meat and rice. For me, it really was the weird crispy/soggy texture that turned me away from this dish.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to visit when you are craving sushi!
