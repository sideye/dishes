I mean, I've had chicken before. Lots of times.  I've probably eaten more chicken than... well, someone else who also eats a lot of chicken but not quite as much as me.  And I've also had waffles.  Great waffles.  Waffles you'd write stories about, how they're made by unicorns in some fantasy rainbow city and sprinkled with little wisps of cloud dust.  But I've never had them together is my point. And the whole concept was very intriguing to me.\n\nSo today, mere moments ago, I ventured out into this personally unexplored culinary realm seeking excitement and previously undiscovered bliss. My journey fell short of those expectations, though it was not a complete disappointment by any means.\n\nQuite literally a hole-in-the-wall establishment, the Little Skillet offers no seating, save for the raised loading dock of the business across the street (lucky them). Many reviews have said that they accept cash only, though I paid today with my credit card with no issue at all. The service was prompt and friendly and the young lady at the register did a great job of balancing customers ordering and picking up food.\n\nThe Little Skillet did indeed deliver what it promised: chicken and waffles.  It was simply displayed on the menu as such and, wouldn't you know, that's what ended up in my same-as-every-other-restaurant-in-SoMa to go container. The fried chicken was brown and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, just a hair this side of perfect.  The waffles were... well, relatively unexciting.  They weren't particularly sweet and they were decidedly colder than the chicken.  The tops were crunchy and the bottoms were soft.  The syrup was perhaps the least satisfying of the whole package; It seemed to be more tart than sweet.  \n\nAs I mentioned before, I'm new to this, so consider the source here.  And maybe I have this wrong.  But in my perception of this culinary combination, I assumed that the enticement here was the contrast of flavors, the savory and the sweet.  For me, that didn't really happen.  Let me be clear, I was not displeased with the meal as a whole.  The food was good.  The chicken was REALLY good, and I'm not a huge fan of straight-up fried chicken per se.  But after all I've heard, with the hype of the chicken & waffle experience, this sadly did not live up to it.\n\nSo maybe next time I try the shrimp poboy or the burger or the cobb salad, which were my other inklings today that inevitably lost out to the thoughts of chicken and waffle bliss.

Probably the best fried chicken I've had. Goes really well with the hot sauce and waffles. The right amount of flavoring and also very crispy, warm, and tender. The only thing that is puzzling to me is the portion. Last time I ordered a 2 piece chicken and waffle I actually got 2 prices of wings and one huge piece of breast.

Not too sure about how consistent the portions are...but the quality is good regardless of the portion.\n\nShrimp poboy- Surprisingly yummy. I wasn't expecting much since I usually come here for chicken and waffles, but it is good! The portion is generous and the shrimp is very juicy, plump, and well flavored. The amount of shrimp is proportioned well with the baguette. The poboy also comes with seasoned chips (tasty, but a little on the salty side). This is $12.\n\nLemonade- really good lemonade, does not taste artificial like the ones you make with powder.

I still don't get the appeal of chicken and waffles, but at least these waffles were really fluffy and slightly eggy. Best waffles I've had, from a certified waffly person on waffles. The syrup had a slight...spiced taste to it? Maybe vanilla extra with a little edge? It was like the fancy grown up version of the $1.50 elementary school breakfast I used to get. Eggs (got scrambled) could've used some salt, and could've been a bit more runny. Bacon was the thicker cut kind and they left the fat chewy! 3.5/5 for the waffles and bacon.\n\nAngel biscuit-- this was an alright biscuit, but it wasn't a gamechanger for me. The one at Brenda's was a bit fluffier. 3/5.\n\nThe cheddar grits consisted of a layer of cheddar atop some more or less flavorless grits-- probably healthier than the one at Brenda's, but who goes to eat healthy restaurant Southern food? More flavoring would've been appreciated. It was still good though, but probably only because I like grits. Baby onions sprinkled across the top made it look fancy. 3/5.\n\nFinally, seasoned fries.

The chicken was very crispy and fried very well, but I felt like it was lacking in flavor. I was a little disappointed. The waffles were quite good and the syrup was more on the thin side, which I liked.

Unfortunately, I didn't order a drink because I didn't want to take up space before the food came.  But side note to self to try their cocktails next time I go.\n\nMy 2 friends and I shared the 8 piece fried chicken meal which also comes with 2 sides of your choice or waffles.  We opted in for the sides and chose the jalapeno cornbread muffins (a little lackluster and dry but I liked how bitesize they were) and seasoned fries (must try!!).  The chicken was split up into: 2 drumsticks, 2 wings and 4 breasts.  The pieces, especially the breast, were ginormous.  We couldn't finish everything but I think this meal would be perfect for a group of 4. It was hard not to overeat when the chicken was that juicy and the skin was that crispy,  We also luckily came in during National Waffle Day and they gave us 2 free waffles.  The waffles were alright, nothing noteworthy.  They came with a small side of syrup which didn't seem enough.  Syrup tasted a little strange to me.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-25"}, {"excerpts": ["I had gotten the fried chicken with waffles and seasoned fries.

Also 2pc $7 meal only had 1 waffle (see photos) - wish I had more.\n- Price was about right - but wished my chicken pieces were just a little larger.\n- Tried the mushroom gravy side - really tasty.\n- Lemonade - WOW - its really sour!!!!!\n- Fast service\n\nCons\n- Street parking only - can be hard to find a space\n- Street seating (they have a loading dock across the alley/street that many folks were eating).\n\nReturn Visit\n- Next time I'm in SF craving waffles", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Get yours with the mushroom gravy!!

The place is located in what appears to be an alley - yes an alley.  If you come around noon though you won't have a difficult time finding the place b/c there will be a long line (usually about 10 deep) in font of a pick up window.  Don't worry though, b/c the line is amazingly fast.\n\nTheir menu is simple...they have fried chicken, waffles and po'boys.. ohh and some amazing biscuits (more on that later).  My coworker raved about the fried chicken and I was in the mood for some waffles (go figure) so that's what I ordered.  I added in some mushroom gravy just to round things out.\n\nAfter ordering my food I stepped to the side and waited.  After about 5 minutes I heard my name called from the window which is lighting fast (especially during lunchtime).  While waiting though, I was able to admire the 20 or so people sitting across the street on the \"dock\" taking in the sun and enjoying their food.  It had a neighbor hood vibe which is cool.\n\nOkay...so on to the food.  I must admit. I eat food in sections.  Yes, you heard it, \"sections\".  That means I eat the appetizer first, the sides next and then the main course.  And the most important rule, is that I don't mix these things...EVER.  So following these rules, I ate one piece of chicken (which was okay) and then had a bite of the waffle (which was okay too).  I was like man..there has to be more to this b/c ppl were lining up to get their food.  So what did I do...I threw the rules out the window.  I put the waffle on the plate, poured some syrup on it then put a piece of chicken on top of the waffle and poured the gravy right on top.  By now other people in the office were curious and wanted to know how it would taste.  So I dove right in.  I got a little piece of everything and I must say the combination is OFF DA HOOK!!!!!!! I was so smitten by the taste that I turned to my coworker and told him he had to construct his food the same way.  I was raving about the food and couldn't get enough. I wanted to go back after work to and get some chicken and waffles for dinner.  While enjoying this amazing combination I was offered a biscuit.  I bit into the biscuit and it had this biscuit like texture but also reminded me of a roll.  I was confused at first but with each bite I fell in love with the satisfaction of having both a biscuit and a roll at the same time.  Its definitely something that I've never had before.\n\nSo...the bottom line.  This place is great and the prices are perfect.  The service is quick and I just love the fact that you order out of a window and there are people hanging out at the dock.  I'll have to give this place four stars b/c they don't take credit cards and the chicken by itself is okay.

You go up to that hole (window) and order your goodies. Dee went for their breakfast sandwich which was friggin huge.  Jason and I decided to share an 8 piece which came with two sides.

Oh and also ordered their biscuits with sausage gravy.\n\nNow there is like one bench against the wall across from little skillet or you can just sit on the high curb. Its a beautiful day so I guess its kind of like having a picnic...in the middle of an alley.\n\nThe fried chicken had a lot of flavor..but I wish it was crispy. It didnt have that crunch. There were some juices but not as much as I would of liked. I like my fried chicken crispy, juicy and flavorful. I guess little skillet got like 2 out of 3. or maybe 1.5 out 3 on my list. So its ok.\n\nTheir biscuits with gravy was pretty good, I really liked taht sausage gravy and their biscuits though kind of small compared to what I'm used to was very nice and tasty.

Its on a ciabatta loaf i believe and they probably used like a carton of eggs. That thing was gigantic.\n\nOverall its a cool place for lunch as long as you dont mind sitting on a bench or curb, and if you are fiending for coffee I believe Blue Bottle is just the next door.
