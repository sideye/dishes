The bite size skewers of the Boquerones (white anchovie, campo real olives, pearl onion and piparra pepper) and Manchego (jamon serrano and apricot-sherry conserva) were a nice start.  I love manchego cheese and gobbled that up quickly.\n\nThe Mar y montana, \"sea and mountain\" (Iberico lardo gently mented over sea urchin with Lomo Iberico) was so amazing we had to order a second.  I crave anything with sea urchin in it.\n\nThe croquetas de pollo were gently crusted and paired well with the english pea filling.  As for the \"Bikini\" (brioche of roasted eggplant and apply jalea), I wished they would have mentioned on the menu it had goat cheese as my wife is allergic to goat cheese and I usually bypass ordering anything with goat cheese as well since I don't like the taste of it.  Goat cheese aside, the eggplant was delicious and I slathered honey all over the brioche to take away the goat cheese flavor.  The Gambas Negras was a nice concept of prawns with black garlic but I felt they overcooked the prawns a little bit but it has great promise if they can execute better next time.\n\nWe had to order the paella right away when we were seated since it took 30-40 minutes to prepare.  I don't know if it was because it was missing saffron or if I was getting full, but this turned out to be a disappointing dish.  I wasn't feeling the mixture of romano beans and pickled yellow beans in the paella. The clams were fresh and the bomba rice was cooked nicely but there was just something missing I couldn't pinpoint from being able to say WOW about the dish. \n\nWe ended the night with some bite size desserts.

There weren't very many seats to be had that had window views at all. The atmosphere is trendy but the tall ceilings made it very loud.\nI husband ordered the Mojito which was nothing like a typical Mojito in all the best ways imaginable.i had the brut bubbly which was perfect.\nOnce we were seated over 40 minutes late when we had a reservation we were crammed into a very tiny space. The table was centered so that the person seating along the fabric benched side of the table was seating in the crack. The waitress did help us move the table but there were only about 4 inches to move it. The sitting part of my dining experience wasn't lovely :/\n\nOur dinner began with the fuet which was fantastic.\nWe next received the Ensalada de Achicoria & Coliflor con Romescu- they were both good but the cauliflower dish was definitely our favorite. If I were dining there again I would probably only order the cauliflower dish.\nAt coqueta they bring around small bite-size bites on Toothpicks called and pintxos.  We were only able to try to of them and one was decent the other was horrible.\n\nOne of the Pintxos- Tortilla de Espinacas - i'm so glad they only had 1left it was disgusting I wish Ihadn't taken a single bite\n\n\nThe Jamn  serano pinto- manchego & apricot- sherry conserva- pretty good\n\nNext we were brought the octopus which had been recommended to us- I'm so glad it was! One of the best octopus I've ever had. \n\nDuck & pork meatballs- they were a little sweet/ my favorite dish of the evening \nOur last item of the meal was the Lubina a la Brasa which is served with the head & with a large wedge of grilled lemon, flake salt, & a green olive & preserved Meyer lemon salsa on the side with a little salsa on top. I I understand this concept however I felt like we were doing a lot of the dishes work by seasoning it. I understand that sometimes people like to season it to their own tasting but it actually got a little messy and I really would have preferred for the kitchen to season our fish. This was my husband's favorite dish of the night I wished we had stopped at the meatballs. \nWe chose churros for dessert & they were pretty good but not the best I've ever had. The berry powder was a nice touch.\nOverall, I'm giving them 3 out of 5 stars due to our wait on a Wednesday night, the noisy environment and the fact that all not all of their dishes were 100% spot on.

I also cook Spanish food and paella is one of my specialties. With that being said, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I brought my wife and my mom on this special trip. We arrived 16 April on a Saturday shortly after they opened at 11:30am. We didn't have reservations so they sat us in the bar, which is where we usually prefer to sit anyway. The first thing we noticed was the infestation of flies flying overhead. I mean there must have been close to a couple dozen flying in a group. My mother had a hard time getting up on the bar stool and with the flies near us we decided to sit outside on the bench and picnic table where not a single fly bothered us. I immediately ordered the seafood paella since I knew this would take some time to cook. We also ordered one each of white wine and red wine Sangrias.

Good, but no wow factor here either. Lastly our paella was served. This was probably our biggest disappointment. I am use to saffron in my paella, which is synonymous with paella. Not a hint was detected. Not enough seafood broth was used either. First of all I couldn't detect any flavors of seafood. The paella had primarily tomato based flavors instead. As a result of not enough broth being used. the paella was dry. The clams were cooked nicely, but the shrimp was kind of mushy in texture, not firm. The house cured chorizo lacked flavor and probably did not belong in this dish. It provided a waxy tasteless texture. For $45 this was a huge failure.

I love the idea of shoestring crispy potatoes piled high with fried egg, shrimp, and chorizo dressing. I don't know why or what it so special but the combination worked. This reminded me of a breakfast item since there were hash browns (crispy potato) and fried egg.\n\nGRILLED RAZOR CLAMS ($14): This was amazing and was one of the best dishes of the night. This is a very rare find and cannot be found at any place I can think of. The clams had the perfect consistency, were juicy, and given in a generous portion. Highly recommended!\n\nWOOD-GRILLED OCTOPUS OCTOPUS ($12): This was amazing and the version at Evvia in Palo Alto was comparable. It was so simplistic yet so delicious. It wasn't rubbery and was tender and very moist. \n\nGAUCHO ($80): This was probably my least favorite dish of the night but was great for meat lovers. It was a special and was basically a hunk of steak cut up. It was cooked perfectly; not too done or too rare. However, it was filling and boring since meat I can go elsewhere for. They gave a generous portion of six pieces but again I wouldn't pay $80 for something I'm not too keen on. \n\nPAELLA ($40): This was so good in every aspect. They gave a great portion and the flavors from the shellfish seeped into the paella which made it tasty. The ingredients added, asparagus, chorizo, gulf prawns, clams, and lemon aioli, made sense with the dish. The concept was new to me and the moment I ate it I fell in love and have tried to find places that serve it let alone replicate it. The closest I've found was Jaleo in Las Vegas but that didn't even compare to the quality I found here.\n\nJAMON PINTXO ($2.50): This was prosciutto wrapped around two pieces of manchego cheese topped with apricot jam. I never thought that a combination like this would taste so good. It was innovative, sweet (from the apricot jam), and salty (from the cheese and prosciutto).\n\nWARM CHOCOLATE CAKE ($10): For any chocolate lovers, I recommend ordering a couple of these. It was very good and the assorted nuts on the side were a great touch to the overall presentation, which was beautiful as always. There was some sauce on the top; a perfect finish to the perfect presentation of the perfect dessert.\n\nMANCHEGO CHEESECAKE ($4): I didn't try this but it looked very innovative yet a bit sweet for my taste. The addition of caramel popcorn was nice. My brother confirmed it was sweet but enjoyed it nonetheless. They provided two smaller pieces which was fair for the price.\n\nPAN CON CHOCOLATE ($4): This had ice cream cookie on the bottom with olive oil ice cream on the top. It paired quite nicely and was delicious. My only gripe was that parts of the olive oil ice cream were saltier. It kind of threw me off but nevertheless it was a brilliant combination.\n\nCOFFEE ($6): They serve Four Barrel coffee which is top notch. Though, I didn't sample this, my dad enjoyed it. The cup they provided it in was very innovative because the glass around the cup prevented customers from burning themselves. \n\nSERVICE: They were really courteous which was expected. They paced everything out very well and made our night an unforgettable one. \n\nDECOR: There are two sides of the restaurant whereas one side is more of a wine bar where the exterior is reminiscent of a green house with beautiful glass windows. Another side is more like a formal dining hall and is for those hoping for a proper meal. Though a bit loud, it adds to the overall experience. No matter which side you get, you should make the most out of your experience because everything from the service to the atmosphere to the innovative creations courtesy of chef Michael Chiarello, is like none you've had before and truly is a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\".\n\nWill I return? Yes please! Though the experience is over and it came out to $50 per person it was well worth it because as I said it's a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\". Everything about our experience made for an amazing night.

Our waterfront is home to a jewel of a ball park, the new Exploratorium, a state of the art cruise terminal, and the excitement of the America's Cup. And now, without much fanfare, a very special restaurant has landed in our neighborhood: Michael Chiarello's, Coqueta. \n\nChef Michael comes to San Francisco on the heels of his successful wine country restaurant, Bottega, which was awarded a place on the Chronicle list of top 100 restaurants in its first year of operation. This was only the most recent of Chef Michael's accolades. Shortly after graduating from the Culinary Institute in New York, after opening a restaurant in Miami, he was named Chef of the Year by Food and Wine Magazine. Ten years later the Culinary Institute of America awarded him the same honor. The chef has ventured into television on PBS and The Food Network, his shows garnering three straight Emmy awards. He also writes cookbooks. Perusing one, I learned more about cooking in the first 20 pages than I have ever learned from a cookbook.  Reading it, I became aware of the chefs philosophy of cooking: \"Food should tell a story with a sense of taste and place.\"\n\nBut at this time in his life Chef Michael has come back to his first love:  running a restaurant.  He is doing it by covering all the bases. He owns a sustainable 20 acre farm in the wine country which supplies much of the produce needed at his ventures.  Referring to Coqueta, he told me, \"Spanish Cuisine is more challenging than my Italian cuisine at Bottega, as I have been more careful about keeping to true tradition.\" Though,\" he admits, \"I have added some vegetables for Californians, as you have to practically beg for a vegetable in Spain.\" \n\nThe restaurant is divided into two sections.  Michael acquired the small building next to Pier 5, a dilapidated awninged structure, and turned it into a glass-enclosed room with views of the Bay and The Embarcadero. The room houses Coqueta's bar as well as space for casual dining. The main dining room, entered through this area, is located in the bulkhead building itself and features a seating bar where one can watch the goings on in the kitchen.\n\nThe menu is uncomplicated but intense. The first option is one of the beautifully presented sliced, in-house cured meat and Iberian cheese plates. Although we didn't try one of these platters, on a next trip, we will go with friends and order the large, El Plat Cap that comes with olive oil tortas and pan de cristal con tomate, the only bread Coqueta serves (the chef explained that bread is not traditionally served in Spain). This bread is made locally by Panorama Bakery for Coqueta. The only other bakery making it is in Barcelona. \n\nChef Michael has an innovative winner in his \"minis\". These one bite offerings are ordered or taken from a beautiful board, passed around by a server. Of the five offered, I found the Chorizo, roasted artichoke and piquillo peppers delectable, with the artichoke and peppers providing a creamy, rich texture that buffered the chewy but tender chorizo. Another favorite was the Quail egg Diablo. The delicate tiny egg paired beautifully with the pickled mustard seed and small piece of Serrano ham. \n\nKeeping with tradition, the restaurant serves both hot and cold tapas.  Of the cold tapas, two really stand out. Hands down the restaurant's most winning dish is Ensalada resorte.  The preparation comes in a glass with a vibrant and silky English green pea emulsion at the bottom layered with spring vegetables, sieved egg and Serrano ham croutons.  Another favorite, the Delta asparagus, is both beautiful and flavorful. The large stalks are trimmed back to the delicate white and are poached in olive oil, topped with grated smoky Idiazabal firm goat cheese and Serrano ham bits and accompanied by piquillo pepper aioli. \n\nOf the hot tapas, the wood grilled octopus is scrumptious. It is fired on the grill, with the body firm but tender, the tentacles crispy. This dish is served with roasted fingerling potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and dusted with pimento powder.  Another standout: the Sunny side-up egg dish, with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing. As Chef Michael says, \"I've always believed anything goes for breakfast, so breakfast should go at anytime, too.\" I believe him. \n\nAmong the entr\u00e9es, the winner is the mouth-watering Pluma, a pork shoulder loin imported from Spain especially for Chef Michael. This is the most expensive dish on the menu but easily shared, which makes it the least expensive of the entrees. The preparation time is 30 minutes but the time goes by quickly when you are eating tapas. This tender loin, easily cut with your fork, has a honey-chili glaze. \n\nWe have a super star chef and a super star restaurant at a super star location.

They serve many Spanish staples, including Spanish cured meats and cheeses, pintxos, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella. Trust a renowned chef like Michael Chiarello to wonderfully elevate Spanish flavors with his own delicious flare.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing here: PLUMA, which is a honey-chili glazed, acorn-fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin (aka the creme de la creme of Spanish piggies). It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish.

Yum!\n\nPutting my fangirl enthusiasm aside, Coqueta is good but not good enough to be on my regular rotation of Spanish restaurants. For one, it's a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're not in a big group and want to sample everything (or on a date, for instance). Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest. The Barca gintonic is arguably the best gin & tonic in the city. It's such a beautiful drink with vibrant flavors to match. I was also pleasantly surprised that you can order a porron of wine, which is SUCH a Spanish novelty. I have a porron from Spanish relatives just collecting dust at my house, but seeing it at Coqueta makes me want to bring back the joy of spilling wine everywhere.\n\nOther notes:\n-Open late\n-Front area is nice for hanging out but can get really competitive for space\n-Olives are from the Chiarello Vineyards, not Spain", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["DISHES:\n\nEl Gran Plat Cap which is the chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses served with homemade membrillo, Marcona almond, extra virgin olive oil torta, pan de crista and tomaquet.

Upon arriving the place was jammed but we did get seating within 10 minutes of our arrival which was great.  The bar area was packed so we just waited to get a drink at our table.\n\nWe were promptly greeted for water and then our server arrived asking us for drinks. She was fantastic, friendly, and funny with a great sense of humor.  So, after looking at the menu, it was time to dig into the ordering.\n\nSeveral at the table decided to share a set of dishes and three others (including me) decided to order our own set to share.\n\nDISHES:\n\nEl Gran Plat Cap which is the chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses served with homemade membrillo, Marcona almond, extra virgin olive oil torta, pan de crista and tomaquet.  The plate came with a generous amount of cheeses (3 types) and 3 different means including some salumi and sausage which was slightly spicy with great lingering flavor.  Put some of the goat cheese or blue cheese on a piece of that spicy sausage and your mouth would water in excitement. Good for 3-4 to share but only a few bites of each.  If you love this and have 5-6 people I would order two of these.\n\nCroquetas de Pollo which is Chicharron crusted chicken and English Pea Croquetas with cured citrus (tangelo).  This was a great dish with that crisp Chicarron outer crispy exterior which when eaten breaks into that soft and hot center with the chicken and English pea filling.  Came 6 to the order so this could be shared by at least 3-4 people.\n\nThe most unique dish of the evening was the \"Sunny Side-Up\" huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts, Chile de Arbol, and chorizo dressing. This was WOW in your mouth.  Everything was mixed together (see my video) by the server and then turned over for consumption...very fast consumption I may add.  This is a do not miss dish!\n\nGambas Negras was the next dish which was ordered by the other group at the table. This was olive oil poached head on gulf prawns with black garlic and chile sauce. This was outstanding as I did taste this as well.  Very rich in flavor and not too heavy on the garlic but just enough to push the flavor through the entire shrimp.\n\nAlbondiga a la Feria was next up which were the duck and pork meatballs. DUCK? PORK? MEATBALL?  YEEESSSSSS!!!!!!  This was an interesting meat ball. Not very firm yet very flavorful. Pick this one up with your finger or slide your fork under each because sticking it will lead to them being broken.  A good dish but it wasn't my favorite, but worth a try for sure.\n\nFAVORITE DISH:\n\nPulpo a la Parrilla. This was wood grilled Mediterranean Octopus, with fresh fingerling potoatos and Pimenton Olive Oil.  I get octopus whenever I can especially when I can get a big fat tentacle with a little charring going on. This is exactly what we got.  You could cut this with a fork barely pressing down it was so tender.  The flavor here with the wood smoke impregnated throughout ever piece of the octopus was fantastic. This was definitely my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nTo finish for the evening, we decided to get an order of the Churro's with drinking Mexican Chocolate.  To the guy who sat next to me with his girlfriend (if he reads this), thanks again for sharing those Churro's.  He insisted we take the two they weren't going to eat and so we tried them.  After trying them we had to order a full order for the table. Dipping that Churro into the Mexican chocolate was heavenly but picking up the chocolate and drinking it to the finish was an awesome way to finish off with an espresso.

Also I got a tendon kind of texture that ruined the meatball for me, I took one bite and didn't have any more\n\n*Patatas Bravas* - ugh, I was so disappointed in the little fried potatoes both last time and this time getting them. In September they were heavenly: light and crispy. But each time since then, they've been oily and dense\n\n*Croquettes de Pollo* - another let down, and sadly so, as they were a favorite in the past. The filling of chicken and peas had a curdled texture and an overly oniony after taste and was not hot inside the breaded casings\n\n*Salmon Ahumado* - little open-faced salmon sandwiches. Sooo fishy. And way too cheesy. The Queso Fresca was piled high and the salmon was slimy and gooey with truffle honey. The bread it was served on reminded me of an old toasted Bagel Bite and was a harsh pairing for the softer ingredients matched with it\n\nWe had other Tapas too, but they were nothing to say much about, good or bad.\n\n~Our Entr\u00e9es~\n\n*Paella* - I was very excited to try this as it's a classic dish, and supposedly one of the star plates at Coqueta.

I had a bite of the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream and was not enthused by the bitter, moldy taste. \n\nI hope we go again so Coqueta can get out of this slump and show us all that same great food we experienced just a few months ago.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-06-03"}, {"excerpts": ["El Gran Plat Cap\" Do a half size and enjoy it with some Chardonnay ; frogs leap.

As for the \"Bikini\" (brioche of roasted eggplant and apply jalea), I wished they would have mentioned on the menu it had goat cheese as my wife is allergic to goat cheese and I usually bypass ordering anything with goat cheese as well since I don't like the taste of it.  Goat cheese aside, the eggplant was delicious and I slathered honey all over the brioche to take away the goat cheese flavor.  The Gambas Negras was a nice concept of prawns with black garlic but I felt they overcooked the prawns a little bit but it has great promise if they can execute better next time.\n\nWe had to order the paella right away when we were seated since it took 30-40 minutes to prepare.  I don't know if it was because it was missing saffron or if I was getting full, but this turned out to be a disappointing dish.  I wasn't feeling the mixture of romano beans and pickled yellow beans in the paella. The clams were fresh and the bomba rice was cooked nicely but there was just something missing I couldn't pinpoint from being able to say WOW about the dish. \n\nWe ended the night with some bite size desserts.

Our reservation was right at opening and it got pretty busy immediately.\n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed. It's expensive but worth a visit.\n\nFOOD: Most everything on the menu looked pretty delicious to me. I'd recommend coming with a bigger group so that you can order and try more dishes without going bankrupt. Highlights for me were the MAR Y MONTANA (sea urchin sandwich) and the SALMON AHUMADO (smoked salmon sandwich). On the other hand, the pintxos were rather disappointing.For $2.50 per bite-sized skewer, I was expecting something more impressive, and while they were pretty tasty, they weren't particularly unique in flavor.\n\nPRICE: Expensive! But it's tapas so there shouldn't be any surprises there. They recommend getting 3 tapas per person, so it can easily add up to $50+ per person, but my friend and I found 4 tapas and 3 skewers to be enough. \n\nSERVICE: Solid and attentive. The waiters checked in on us now and then refilled our water frequently, though they did mess up and refill my friend's water with sparkling water instead of normal water. Food comes out quickly.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Pretty lively and trendy restaurant. There's a nice view of the bay and LOTS of natural lighting during the day (always of fan of well-lit places). There's table seating, high table seating and bar seating, but the place isn't super big so all the tables are rather close together.\n\n=======================================\n\n-PINTXOS ($2.50 each) - 3/5\n[bite-sized skewers]\nThe pintxos are on 7x7's Big Eat list for 2015, but I wasn't particularly impressed. I tried 3 skewers: the BOQUERONES (white anchovie), CHORIZO, and HUEVOS DE CODORNIZ (quail egg).

My favorite of the 3 was the white anchovie, so I'd recommend that if you really want to try one. The chorizo was tasty but not unique. The quail egg was the most disappointing - just tasted like a normal egg.\n\n-MAR Y MONTANA, sea and mountain ($14) - 5/5\n[Ib\u00e9rico lardo gently melted over sea urchin with lomo ib\u00e9rico]\nMMMM a must try! The sea urchin was soo soft and creamy. Basically melts in your mouth. The bread was incredibly hard and crunchy, which I normally wouldn't like, but I think it was a good contrast to the texture of the uni. GET THIS.\n\n-SALMON AHUMADO ($8) - 5/5\n[Smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey]\nYUM. I could probably eat a million of these! If you like smoked salmon, you'll LOVE this. The salmon had an amazing soft texture that was contrasted nicely with the hard/crunchy bread. The truffle honey was delicious! Subtle and lightly sweet, and paired really well with the salmon and cheese.\n\n-GAMBAS AL NEGRO ($14) - 4/5\n[Olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce]\nThe shrimp was cooked perfectly tender, and the sauce was pretty flavorful but lacking in the \"chili\" aspect. I'd recommend sucking on the prawn head - it's full of flavor! The dish comes with 3 prawns and 3 slices of toasted bread/baguette that's good for sauce-dipping.\n\n-PULPO A LA PARILLA ($14) - 3.5/5\n[Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potato and piment\u00f3n olive oil]\nTender and nicely grilled with a slight smokiness, but honestly, the texture was probably much more memorable than the flavors.

After fellow yelper, Rodney's review, I knew this was a must pit stop while in SF. I was in luck when I got reservation!\n\nWe got there early and was seated in a room that is adjacent to the actual dining area, this area has the bar and a few seats where people sat and drank as well. We ordered a drink to start the night, the Kalimotxo which has Mexican Coke, Red Sangria, and Cinnamon. This drink was full of flavor but resides a bit on the dry side. It is only served in a party pitcher (500 mL). \n\nWe were shown to our seats promptly, matter of fact, 10 minutes before our actual reservation time.  Our server, Lowell was AWESOME from the beginning. He is very knowledgeable of all the amazing food and drinks Coqueta serves. After we looked at the menu and made our choices, he picked and chose the order of our food and he was spot on! \n\nUnfortunately, I really wanted to try the \"Mar y Montana\", but they were sold out of the sea urchin (this gives me the perfect excuse to come back!).\n\nThe patatas bravas (freshly dug, crispy new potatoes, lightly smoked, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli). It was flavorful and the potatoes are perfect bite size pieces. The garlic alioli and salsa help brought out the flavor of the smoked potatoes. There was a great balance of salty and sweet.\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas (served alongside with cured cara-cara orange) (3 pieces). These puppies were like mini pot pies, bursting with richness in flavor! Super creamy and packed with great seasoning. The cured orange was served alongside with the croquetas, but I didn't try them. \n\nGambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on Gulf prawns with black garlic and chili). This was an amazing dish. Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert.

I specifically asked for a table by the window with a weeks reservations in advance and she sits me & my boss at the bar.  We see an open table for two close enough to the window and ask why we can't be seated there.  My boss seeing I was upset said the young lady asked for a table by the window and we see that table is free.  Grumpily the hostess leads us there.  Ok not a good start.\n\nThe restaurant itself was beautiful . Two separate, and very different, rooms provided a nice union -- Bar 5, a glass-enclosed terrace has an outdoor/indoor feel, with window-filled walls featuring views of the San Francisco Bay. The restaurant has an intimate feel with the wooden tables, stone walls, flickering candles with most of the tables  having a view of the kitchen.\n\nWith the glowing reviews that I read from other Yelpers I really wanted to give Coqueta an amazing review,  I can look past the hohum service if the food was good.

Really can you not have been more creative than tater tots for a Michael Chiarello restaurant?\n\nRoasted Padron Peppers ~ my least favorite, the sherry vinegar drowning out the crisp pepper taste could barely even taste the jamon serrano. I was getting really sad!\n\nSmoked salmon ~ open -faced with queso fresco with truffle honey, a play on bagels and lox but the salmon was overpowered by the honey. Interesting though I liked it. It was ok not spectacular.\n\nWood-grilled octopus ~ the most interesting dish I ate at Coqueta.  Smoky, tender, charry, wonderful. I did not understand the purpose of the potatoes on the plate because they detracted from the octopus flavor and the portion was tiny even for a tapas.\n \nGrilled Iberico Secreto ~ Despite being pork, it tasted like beef, didn't stand out. For $24 I was better off ordering a steak and getting full someplace else.\n\nGambas al negro ~ lacked flavor and spice that gambas usually has, and with a measly three pieces of prawns for $14 I was really getting depressed on how this meal was turning out to be.\n\nI was too embarrassed to show how displeased I was to my boss who was clearly eager to show his appreciation for my work for the company.  Walking back to the office I asked him what he thought of the meal. He said it was ok, he expected it to be pricey for it being at The Embarcadero, but the portions were too small and he has had exactly the same types of dishes in other tapas places that tasted way better than what we ordered and had bigger \"tapas portions.\"   \n\nWell that sums it up.

Stuffed full of humungous buttery prawns, clams, chorizo with a bite, tender spears of asparagus, snap peas that actually snapped with freshness, mustard florets . . . and heaven knows what else they managed to put in there, for a virtual symphony in skillet. The rice stuck to the edges, for that perfect charred bit where you must scrape it off and (if you don't give a crap about table manners, which I don't), lick fingers. It's a bit on the salty side, which I love and the lemon aioli  is the perfect finishing touch. My husband didn't go for the aioli and instead, loved the little peppers they gave with it.

There's lots of terrific little Spanish places in S.F., and I like almost all of them, but the food here was an experience of a different caliber, hitting high notes all over the place. I wish only that the acoustics were better, because it's deafening, brick and hard ceilings everywhere, but that seems to be de rigueur these days :-( The service was warm, welcoming, professional, responsive.

Everything blended well together. It was very reminiscent of a Spanish-style breakfast. \n\nGrilled beef shortribs - this was my least favorite dish. The ribs were nothing special. They tasted texturally like Korean shortribs, but lacked the flavor. The glaze, pomegranate, and seville orange didn't add anything.\n\nPaella - this was the star entree of dinner.

I will forever have a high bar for a gin and tonic for the rest of my life. (Their sangria was...okay, I guess...)\n\nSince OpenTable and the receptionist made me very aware of how there were no reservations/tables available on a Saturday, my friend and I sat at the patio. It was so tiny, and the high chair was not very good for my back -- totally our bad for wanting to eat here for weekend brunch. Anyway, tapas - small dishes, also pricey here. \n\nWe had (copying straight from the Winter 2014 menu):\n1) \"El Plat Cap\" (Chef's selection of cured meats, $26) -- this was an \"OK\" starter. Having been spoiled with amazing French charcuterie at other restaurants, I was not impressed.\n2) Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo (House made smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo Vermouth vinegar, $4) -- the chips alone were delicious and had very nice textures. I did not enjoy the \"salsa\" though, as I found it too vinegar-y.\n3) Patatas Bravas (Freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli, $8) -- I am not a big fan of potatoes (trust me, it is hard to believe, especially since I've lived in Germany), and found this to be too hot (temperature-wise) at first, but it was yummy.\n4) Gambas al negro (Olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce, $14) -- OK, honestly, aside from the gin and tonic, THIS was my favourite thing!!!! It was SO flavourful and delicious. Sadly, there are only three prawns and three slices of bread, but the sauce is plentiful.\n5) Pintxos (Bite-size skewers, $2.50 each):\n5a) House cured boquerones (White anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guindilla peppers) -- cold, but it was pretty good, a lot better than I expected.\n5b) Huevos de Codorniz (Quails egg \"Diablo\", pickled mustard seed, and jam\u00f3n Serrano) -- also cold, and was not what I expected, I preferred the other skewer I ordered.\n\nVERDICT: Maybe Spanish tapas are not for me, or the Californian touch on some of the dishes threw me off, but I was definitely not on the same page as my friend. I will say, though: the gin and tonic and prawn dishes are enough to make me want to come back. All the other foods I ordered: I could care less. Because I sat at the patio, I felt really cramped, and there was no real nice view of the waterfront.\n\nThe service here was so-so. Never connected with the server, and it was fairly slow, but, whatever, I'll just enjoy my alcohol.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-01-09"}, {"excerpts": ["The 5 skewer options were: house cured boquerones, chorizo, jamon serrano, tortilla de espinacas, huevos de codorniz.

On a spontaneous sunny Saturday, we were walking our dog in the area and decided to stop by for a mid-day snack.\n\nSince we had a dog with us, our only option was to sit outside at one of two available communal tables.  There were tons of bussers coming and going to refill water, but our server was nowhere to be found.  It took us almost 30 minutes to find our server so we decided to order everything at once, knowing they might not be back until we were ready to pay. [minus 1 star for slow service]\n\nWhat we got:\n\nKalimotxo - Sangria mixed with coke and cinnamon that comes in a Spanish party pitcher.  The coke made it bubbly, which was a refreshing spin on the typical sangria.\n\nBite Sized Skewers - the menu says \"offered at tableside\", which we found out later, meant that they will pre-make a bunch of skewers and bring you the whole board to pick out the skewers you want.  I don't prefer it served this way, since I feel like the food isn't as fresh when it's been \"chillin\" on the board for who knows how long.  The 5 skewer options were: house cured boquerones, chorizo, jamon serrano, tortilla de espinacas, huevos de codorniz.  My favorite was  the tortilla de espinacas because the cana de cabra cheese was delicious.  \n\nSunny Side-Up Huevo - this dish BLEW MY SOCKS OFF, we were shamelessly scraping the very last bits off the plate.  The dish comes with 4 medium sized shrimps, crispy potato strings, a sunny-side egg and chorizo dressing.  The chorizo dressing, which is basically chorizo oil with crumbled chorizo, really makes the dish.   After combining the egg and the potato, the dish is spicy marriage of flavors and textures.\n\nAround 5pm, the sun was beginning to wane, and the pier suddenly got REALLY windy and cold.  My advice would be to find seating indoors if you're able to.

Unfortunately, we were running late, and although we called ahead, they had to give away our table so we had to wait another 25 minutes once we arrived at the restaurant. The worst part about having to wait for a table was that the bar area is small (slightly smaller than the restaurant side), and they also have people dining there, so there really isn't much room to sit or stand around. Also, one of the servers dropped a tray full of drinks on the floor and splashed my friends leg, and they apologized quickly but didn't bring a towel for her leg like they said.

The egg was cooked perfectly and went well with the other ingredients. The chorizo was really hard to chew, and was also on the salty side like the manchego. I wouldn't get either again.\n-Mar y Montana/Sea & Mountain (Ibercio Lardo Gently Melted Over Sea Urchin w/Lomo Iberico, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#7nTxEi7qt_RBSSzGo4Bn5Q): Delicious, and one of favorite dishes, although I wished there was enough uni to cover the entire cracker.\n-Pan Con Tomate (Iconic Cristal Bread & Tomato Sofrito, $5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#sMjWKLWkJTwKXoV1-4nlmg): So-so, the bread was too toasted/hard- skip!\n-Croquetas de Pollo (Chicharon Crusted Chicken & English Pea Croquetas w/Cured Cara Cara Orange, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#7YjlrIZZmhpWLqy4aTjAfQ): Delicious, and a must order!

If I were to be really picky, the only thing that would probably bother me is the size of the pintxos; they were much smaller than we were expecting for $2.50 each. They were more like a nibble than a bite. I'd also like to point out that don't expect authentic spanish tapas, the dishes were definitely elevated but nonetheless very delicious.\n\nFor a about $120 we actually ate A LOT of food!\n\nWHAT WE DRANK:\nBarca Gintonic\nGlass of Red\n\nWHAT WE ATE:\nBoquerones (olives)\nPintxos: 1 Boquerones, 1 Cohrizo, 2 Huevos de Codorniz\nPan con Tomato (bread with tomato)\nHuevos Nacional (deviled eggs)\nPimientos de Padron (roasted peppers topped with jamon)\nPulpo a la Parilla (grilled octopus with potatos)\nTrio de Salchichas (grilled sausages)\nVerduras a la Catalana (greens with raisins and pine nuts)\n\nDESSERT:\nManchego Cheesecake dessert bites\n\nSo we started off with with drinks! The Barca Gintonic was definitely the highlight, it was gorgeous! It's a must have when you go there!\n\nThe hubby's highlight were the roasted peppers, they had a lot of flavor especially with the slivers of jamon on top. The octopus was nice and soft and the grilled sausages were also very flavorful; I especially enjoyed the blood sausage. Believe it or not my most favorite thing to eat were the greens, they came in a nice bown and were bitter, yet sweet; they went well with everything.\n\nNow, I'm a big coffee and dessert person but by the end of our meal we were the last ones in the restaurant and I could tell the staff were preparing to close. I got shy and didn't end up ordering dessert even though our server suggested we still could. The reason for the five stars is that she ended up bringing us dessert anyway which were the cheesecake bites! I was so delighted that I got my little dessert at the end of the meal; for free! HUGE thank you to our waitress for that!\n\nAgain, a solid great place to eat with a menu I honestly haven't experienced anywhere in the bay area.

The service was....cold, a little snide, and dare I say borderline bitchy.  I was really surprised because Coqueta is a nice place and I usually find service in San Francisco to be really great (when thinking of east coast vs west coast service).  But the servers came across as haughty and rude and like they couldn't be bothered to check on us.  Again, I'm not sure if this is a bar vs restaurant situation but if you get bad service at the bar, why would you ever want to come back and eat at the restaurant?  At one point, we asked a server who delivered one of our tapas if we could order an additional dish from her or if we should wait for our original waiter and her tone and response was basically akin to I've kinda got my hands full, don't bother me which was really off putting.  One server was friendly and enthusiastic but after at least 2 servers with attitude, I wasn't really pleased with the service.  As for the drinks, there are a lot of interesting and unique cocktails on the menu.  They are described in vivid detail and I was quite excited to try some of these drinks.  However, I think Coqueta suffers from incredible creative cocktails that I don't think work at all with the food on the menu or maybe even by themselves.  I'm all for trying something new when it comes to cocktail combinations but I don't understand why these two cocktails were even on the menu; the flavors are so overwhelming that I cannot imagine them working well with any of the tapas.  The Dirty by the Sea was a seaweed influenced vodka with a sea anemone and it looked wonderful with the sea anemone but it was so incredibly briny that it tasted exactly like when you go snorkeling and accidentally swallow sea water, it's honestly that salty and briny.  It was overwhelming to the palate and I could only see it working if you ate a plate of boiled potatoes with no seasonings.  I also tried In the Haight which I ordered primarily for the description of its \"patchouli memory\".  I mean, how can you resist a description like that?  However, the only memory that lingered was the smoky flavor of my vodka that while not as off putting as the Dirty by the Sea, it was still so strong that it bordered on palate destroying.  I felt like someone locked me in a meat smoker after drinking this thing.  I really don't understand the place of such strong drinks on a menu filled with pretty flavorful tapas.  \n\nEven though the food was probably a three star experience, I was so disappointed by the service and the cocktails that I have to give this a two star review because I was really excited to try this place due to the stellar reviews and this was a real let down for me.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-12-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the Fideua, Gambas Negro, Iberico de Bellota, and the boquerones.

Now the waterfront property means prices are up there, and Id say thats the only real drawback here. Our server knew my friends from another restaurant so I got taken care of by association. Id like to have a full large meal here and see how it compares to Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and the Basque Country but for snacks it's pretty solid.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-05-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Husband and I started with a variety of pinxtos (one bite tapas), the best one being the house cured boquerones (white anchovies with olives and peppers).

Michael Chiarello actually in the kitchen tonight making sure everything ran as well as it could.  For an opening night, I am confident in giving this restaurant five stars.  Chef Chiarello outdid himself with his new San Francisco outpost.  The menu is a wonderful combination of comfort and excitement.  Husband and I started with a variety of pinxtos (one bite tapas), the best one being the house cured boquerones (white anchovies with olives and peppers).  We then proceeded to order our fair share of tapas including, roasted padron peppers, patatas bravas, tortilla spagnola (called \"Andres\" here), crispy shrimp in a chickpea flour pancake, grilled albondigas, chicken & english pea croquettes -- each tapas was well seasoned, beautifully presented and more importantly so full of umami with a nod to authentic Catalan cuisine with the freshness of California produce.  Cal Pep would be proud of this place.\n\nWe ended our meal by sharing the Fideua, a traditional Catalan noodle dish similar to paella.  The dish came with a number of large tender shrimp and Iberico ham.  It was a really good version, almost as good as the one hubby and I had in Stiges at a fabulous beachside restaurant called La Santa Maria (but perhaps the setting played a part in why their fideua is still so memorable to me today).\n\nService was impeccable -- hats off to the maitre d' for running a tight ship.

Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar.

It should have been the piece de resistance, but was under inspired.  I would definitely skip it next time, and spend the $40 on more tapas.\n\nThe Ambiance:  Great, very comfortable, rustic yet open, perfect size crowd, spacious.  I'm looking forward to a cocktail in the pop-out, heated bar next time.\n\nThe Service:  It was good, but there was a noticeable inconstancy in the runner staff.  Some of our tapas was plunked on the table, and announced as the runner turned and scuttled back to the kitchen for the next service.   No presentation or time for questions.   Other tapas was presented, stirred, mixed, or served with a smile and interest.

Service was overall pretty prompt. \nMy husband and I dined here for our second anniversary and I was hoping as the location is on the water that we would get some romantic setting which we really didn't. There weren't very many seats to be had that had window views at all. The atmosphere is trendy but the tall ceilings made it very loud.\nI husband ordered the Mojito which was nothing like a typical Mojito in all the best ways imaginable.i had the brut bubbly which was perfect.\nOnce we were seated over 40 minutes late when we had a reservation we were crammed into a very tiny space. The table was centered so that the person seating along the fabric benched side of the table was seating in the crack. The waitress did help us move the table but there were only about 4 inches to move it. The sitting part of my dining experience wasn't lovely :/\n\nOur dinner began with the fuet which was fantastic.\nWe next received the Ensalada de Achicoria & Coliflor con Romescu- they were both good but the cauliflower dish was definitely our favorite. If I were dining there again I would probably only order the cauliflower dish.\nAt coqueta they bring around small bite-size bites on Toothpicks called and pintxos.  We were only able to try to of them and one was decent the other was horrible.\n\nOne of the Pintxos- Tortilla de Espinacas - i'm so glad they only had 1left it was disgusting I wish Ihadn't taken a single bite\n\n\nThe Jamn  serano pinto- manchego & apricot- sherry conserva- pretty good\n\nNext we were brought the octopus which had been recommended to us- I'm so glad it was! One of the best octopus I've ever had. \n\nDuck & pork meatballs- they were a little sweet/ my favorite dish of the evening \nOur last item of the meal was the Lubina a la Brasa which is served with the head & with a large wedge of grilled lemon, flake salt, & a green olive & preserved Meyer lemon salsa on the side with a little salsa on top. I I understand this concept however I felt like we were doing a lot of the dishes work by seasoning it. I understand that sometimes people like to season it to their own tasting but it actually got a little messy and I really would have preferred for the kitchen to season our fish. This was my husband's favorite dish of the night I wished we had stopped at the meatballs. \nWe chose churros for dessert & they were pretty good but not the best I've ever had. The berry powder was a nice touch.\nOverall, I'm giving them 3 out of 5 stars due to our wait on a Wednesday night, the noisy environment and the fact that all not all of their dishes were 100% spot on.

On a spontaneous sunny Saturday, we were walking our dog in the area and decided to stop by for a mid-day snack.\n\nSince we had a dog with us, our only option was to sit outside at one of two available communal tables.  There were tons of bussers coming and going to refill water, but our server was nowhere to be found.  It took us almost 30 minutes to find our server so we decided to order everything at once, knowing they might not be back until we were ready to pay. [minus 1 star for slow service]\n\nWhat we got:\n\nKalimotxo - Sangria mixed with coke and cinnamon that comes in a Spanish party pitcher.  The coke made it bubbly, which was a refreshing spin on the typical sangria.\n\nBite Sized Skewers - the menu says \"offered at tableside\", which we found out later, meant that they will pre-make a bunch of skewers and bring you the whole board to pick out the skewers you want.  I don't prefer it served this way, since I feel like the food isn't as fresh when it's been \"chillin\" on the board for who knows how long.  The 5 skewer options were: house cured boquerones, chorizo, jamon serrano, tortilla de espinacas, huevos de codorniz.  My favorite was  the tortilla de espinacas because the cana de cabra cheese was delicious.  \n\nSunny Side-Up Huevo - this dish BLEW MY SOCKS OFF, we were shamelessly scraping the very last bits off the plate.  The dish comes with 4 medium sized shrimps, crispy potato strings, a sunny-side egg and chorizo dressing.  The chorizo dressing, which is basically chorizo oil with crumbled chorizo, really makes the dish.   After combining the egg and the potato, the dish is spicy marriage of flavors and textures.\n\nAround 5pm, the sun was beginning to wane, and the pier suddenly got REALLY windy and cold.

Highlights for me were the MAR Y MONTANA (sea urchin sandwich) and the SALMON AHUMADO (smoked salmon sandwich). On the other hand, the pintxos were rather disappointing.For $2.50 per bite-sized skewer, I was expecting something more impressive, and while they were pretty tasty, they weren't particularly unique in flavor.\n\nPRICE: Expensive! But it's tapas so there shouldn't be any surprises there. They recommend getting 3 tapas per person, so it can easily add up to $50+ per person, but my friend and I found 4 tapas and 3 skewers to be enough. \n\nSERVICE: Solid and attentive. The waiters checked in on us now and then refilled our water frequently, though they did mess up and refill my friend's water with sparkling water instead of normal water. Food comes out quickly.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Pretty lively and trendy restaurant. There's a nice view of the bay and LOTS of natural lighting during the day (always of fan of well-lit places). There's table seating, high table seating and bar seating, but the place isn't super big so all the tables are rather close together.\n\n=======================================\n\n-PINTXOS ($2.50 each) - 3/5\n[bite-sized skewers]\nThe pintxos are on 7x7's Big Eat list for 2015, but I wasn't particularly impressed. I tried 3 skewers: the BOQUERONES (white anchovie), CHORIZO, and HUEVOS DE CODORNIZ (quail egg). The skewer combinations/pairings were actually pretty good, but just not that special and not really worth $2.50 per bite. My favorite of the 3 was the white anchovie, so I'd recommend that if you really want to try one. The chorizo was tasty but not unique. The quail egg was the most disappointing - just tasted like a normal egg.\n\n-MAR Y MONTANA, sea and mountain ($14) - 5/5\n[Ib\u00e9rico lardo gently melted over sea urchin with lomo ib\u00e9rico]\nMMMM a must try! The sea urchin was soo soft and creamy. Basically melts in your mouth. The bread was incredibly hard and crunchy, which I normally wouldn't like, but I think it was a good contrast to the texture of the uni. GET THIS.\n\n-SALMON AHUMADO ($8) - 5/5\n[Smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey]\nYUM. I could probably eat a million of these! If you like smoked salmon, you'll LOVE this. The salmon had an amazing soft texture that was contrasted nicely with the hard/crunchy bread. The truffle honey was delicious! Subtle and lightly sweet, and paired really well with the salmon and cheese.\n\n-GAMBAS AL NEGRO ($14) - 4/5\n[Olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce]\nThe shrimp was cooked perfectly tender, and the sauce was pretty flavorful but lacking in the \"chili\" aspect. I'd recommend sucking on the prawn head - it's full of flavor! The dish comes with 3 prawns and 3 slices of toasted bread/baguette that's good for sauce-dipping.\n\n-PULPO A LA PARILLA ($14) - 3.5/5\n[Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potato and piment\u00f3n olive oil]\nTender and nicely grilled with a slight smokiness, but honestly, the texture was probably much more memorable than the flavors.

I will forever have a high bar for a gin and tonic for the rest of my life. (Their sangria was...okay, I guess...)\n\nSince OpenTable and the receptionist made me very aware of how there were no reservations/tables available on a Saturday, my friend and I sat at the patio. It was so tiny, and the high chair was not very good for my back -- totally our bad for wanting to eat here for weekend brunch. Anyway, tapas - small dishes, also pricey here. \n\nWe had (copying straight from the Winter 2014 menu):\n1) \"El Plat Cap\" (Chef's selection of cured meats, $26) -- this was an \"OK\" starter. Having been spoiled with amazing French charcuterie at other restaurants, I was not impressed.\n2) Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo (House made smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo Vermouth vinegar, $4) -- the chips alone were delicious and had very nice textures. I did not enjoy the \"salsa\" though, as I found it too vinegar-y.\n3) Patatas Bravas (Freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli, $8) -- I am not a big fan of potatoes (trust me, it is hard to believe, especially since I've lived in Germany), and found this to be too hot (temperature-wise) at first, but it was yummy.\n4) Gambas al negro (Olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce, $14) -- OK, honestly, aside from the gin and tonic, THIS was my favourite thing!!!! It was SO flavourful and delicious. Sadly, there are only three prawns and three slices of bread, but the sauce is plentiful.\n5) Pintxos (Bite-size skewers, $2.50 each):\n5a) House cured boquerones (White anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guindilla peppers) -- cold, but it was pretty good, a lot better than I expected.\n5b) Huevos de Codorniz (Quails egg \"Diablo\", pickled mustard seed, and jam\u00f3n Serrano) -- also cold, and was not what I expected, I preferred the other skewer I ordered.\n\nVERDICT: Maybe Spanish tapas are not for me, or the Californian touch on some of the dishes threw me off, but I was definitely not on the same page as my friend. I will say, though: the gin and tonic and prawn dishes are enough to make me want to come back. All the other foods I ordered: I could care less.

Unfortunately, we were running late, and although we called ahead, they had to give away our table so we had to wait another 25 minutes once we arrived at the restaurant. The worst part about having to wait for a table was that the bar area is small (slightly smaller than the restaurant side), and they also have people dining there, so there really isn't much room to sit or stand around.

Normally, I would wait, but sometimes I feel guilty eating meat with my veggies friends. The server recommended the chicken croquettes, which would be quick and (of course) delicious. I did, and they were. They were three, two bite bits of cheesy, fried,  chicken deliciousness that were served with slices of orange and slivers of pepper. Yum! Shortly after polishing them off my dish was whisked away and my friend arrived. Just based on that part of my experience, I would say that the service is worth 5 stars. The excellent service continued though out the dinner. Water was poured, new dishes were brought out (great pacing) and empty dishes were whisked away to make room.  Everything we tried (please check out the photos) was delicious. My only real disappointment was the asparagus dish (not sure of the official name).  The Romesco sauce and Manchego that were part of the dish were delicious. The micro greens and the vegetable itself were just OK. The Bikini (brioche a la plancha with ca\u00f1a de cabra, roasted eggplant and Quince Jalea) and Pan con tomate were both particularly good, I think in part because the bread was so wonderful. The dessert was good, but not amazing. I think that and the asparagus are why I can't give 5 stars. If I could I would lean to 4.25 or 4.5. I really wish I had tried the Gambas Negras and Setas al ajillo (sherry laced mushrooms). Both of those are tapas staples for me, but it would have been way too much food. Maybe next time. I also want to try the paella. I typically either go straight for that or have tapas, not both.  I was happy with the cocktails, but for a more traditional experience, go for the wine or one of the wine cocktails.

We usually don't mind these type of seats, especially since you can watch the chefs prepare the food and, if something looks particularly delicious, order that. \n Note that it can get really crowded in peak hours; even the hostess had a hard time getting back to the front after sitting us down.  Dark interior but lot of windows with a view of the water.\n\nService was good- maybe because we were sitting next to the kitchen, we got our food relatively quickly and waters refilled.  Pace was good so that they generally brought out dishes one at a time, with time to digest in between.  \n\nFood:\n*Pan con tomate with jamon serrano ($10)- bread was crispy enough to give texture but not so hard that you would break your teeth.  There was a lot of bread, though, vs the tomato and jamon but still all tasty together nevertheless\n*Patatas bravas ($8)- love how they used whole fingerling potatoes rather than cut up big ones into smaller pieces.  Just enough seasoning and the sauce was tasty- most places I've been will overseason their potatoes / put too many condiments on them\n*Setas al ajillo ($10)- we ordered this as a side; it's rather a lot of mushrooms for two people.  However, we both loved the garlic chips in the mushrooms (warning to those who somehow don't like garlic)\n*Croquetas de Pollo ($9)- this was one of our favorites of the night.  My friend lovingly described them as chicken pot pie in croquette form; rich, decadent, and lot of homey flavors in bite-sized form\n*BIKINI ($10)- hands down my favorite bite!  Great balance of sweetness (from the bread and quince jalea) with the salty roasted eggplant and not too heavy\n*Ablondigas a la Ferria ($14) - can never go wrong with a duck and pork meatball!  Actually I'vd tasted some really bland or dry meatballs but thank god this wasn't.  Super moist (but not falling apart) and the combo of duck and pork meat together gives you a super rich meatball.

That's when!\"\n\n~3 years ago, the [charming] Italian Food Network personality opened this Spanish tapas restaurant on the Embarcadero waterfront. They serve many Spanish staples, including Spanish cured meats and cheeses, pintxos, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella. Trust a renowned chef like Michael Chiarello to wonderfully elevate Spanish flavors with his own delicious flare.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing here: PLUMA, which is a honey-chili glazed, acorn-fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin (aka the creme de la creme of Spanish piggies). It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish. I'm even obsessed with the bottle of extra HONEY-CHILI GLAZE that it's served with. It is really so fantastic that if I could I would regularly pair it with the many, many steaks that I eat.\n\nThe pulpo a la parilla is also worth ordering, as it's executed just as perfectly as the wood-grilled octopus at Bottega (aka my favorite octopus) with the additional pleasure of that pimenton oil. Yum!\n\nPutting my fangirl enthusiasm aside, Coqueta is good but not good enough to be on my regular rotation of Spanish restaurants. For one, it's a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're not in a big group and want to sample everything (or on a date, for instance). Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest. The Barca gintonic is arguably the best gin & tonic in the city. It's such a beautiful drink with vibrant flavors to match. I was also pleasantly surprised that you can order a porron of wine, which is SUCH a Spanish novelty. I have a porron from Spanish relatives just collecting dust at my house, but seeing it at Coqueta makes me want to bring back the joy of spilling wine everywhere.\n\nOther notes:\n-Open late\n-Front area is nice for hanging out but can get really competitive for space\n-Olives are from the Chiarello Vineyards, not Spain", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Also on the wood platter was Pan con Tomate, which I was surprised to find we were charge for.

However, we just couldn't resist when we were in San Francisco. We took the opportunity to dine at Top Chef Master Michael Chiarello's restaurant and for the most part walked out very pleased. I highly recommend making a reservation. We arrived earlier than our reservation time hoping we could sit earlier (our reservation was around 9pm) and we barely sat earlier. However, service was excellent all throughout our meal which was a huge plus. We ordered the following things:\n\nSalm\u00f3n Ahumado (Smoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey): This was the first thing we ate and probably my favorite bite of the night. It wasn't the first time that I've had smoked salmon on toast but this was a masterpiece. Perfectly soft and seasoned just right.The truffle honey added such depth and a pleasant taste that we instantly wished that we had just ordered a bunch more of this to eat. \n\nPan con Tomate (Cristal bread, tomate confitura, house Cured Jam\u00f3n Serrano): It was basically bread with this tomato jelly. I've never had tomato jelly quite like this and it was tasty! Different. My husband didn't really care for it too much though and found the cured jam\u00f3n serrano way too salty. I agreed that this whole dish was just a tad on the salty side but I still found the dish enjoyable. \n\nSunny side-up Huevo With Shrimp (crispy potato, chorizo dressing): Shrimp and eggs! This looked delicious but once our server mixed everything together for us, it became very clear that the dish was just drowning in oil. It was so heavy and there was nothing to cut through that greasy tasty and honestly it was very unpleasant. We did not want to finish this and had to drink a lot of wine to get rid of that oily coating inside our mouth. \n\nPaella ( bomba rice, jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo with thumbelina carrots, pickled garlic scapes, lemon alioli): Paella is honestly one of my favorite foods in the whole world. With that said, Coqueta did not have the best paella. Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty. But I found the rice to be slightly under and that crispy bottom that makes a good paella was a little too burnt. However, I absolutely enjoyed the large shrimps that came with this dish and it was definitely a good portion for us to share. \n\nBizcocho de Arroz con Leche Salvador Dal\u00ed (warm molton arroz con leche cake, huckleberries, arroz con leche ice cream): This was such a pleasant surprise! I've never liked rice in my dessert but we ordered this because my husband likes sweetened rice. This dessert was absolutely delicious. The cake wasn't all that sweet but it was the perfect accompaniment to their rice ice cream. Unique and fantastic. I would order this again and again!\n\nTrio de Pintxos (salted caramel with pimenton, blood orange gelatina with bergamot black tea sugar, olives dulces with chocolate glaze): Everything was made in house which was pretty impressive. I really appreciated the fact that Coqueta opened me up to different flavor combinations. This was a nice way to taste a variety of gourmet candy and it was really fun to try something new. We especially enjoyed the salted caramel with pimenton. \n\nManchego Cheesecake (with caramel popcorn): This was just a small bite and it was a good finish to our meal. We enjoyed the texture, and the caramel popcorn that provided the right bite to the creamy cheesecake. It was good but I think it's perfect as a small bite. I don't think I could eat a whole slice because it was very sweet and very rich. \n\nOverall, this was a solid Spanish tapas restaurant.

When asked if they could do it with vodka instead of gin, the wait discouraged me and said the vodka wouldn't mix well with the olives, which I assumed meant some kind of molecular gastronomy spheres.  I was confused/surprised when I received a gin martini with 2 normal olives in it...  At this point our waiters changed and when I inquired, she told me that the description is wrong and they don't do the molecular olives any longer.

"], "author": "Cheryl M.", "review": "Let's set aside the fact that this is a Michael Chiarello place, and examine it on three separate topics: Food, Service, Environment.\n\nFOOD\nThe cocktails here are amazing. We ordered the Galleon ($12) and the special punch ($12), which was essentially the Farmer's Market Punch with a few tweaks. They also serve wine in the Porron, the traditional Spanish wine pitcher with a spout. We saw a few people trying to drink directly from the Porron, which is always entertaining.\n\nWe started our meal with one chorizo bite-size skewer ($2.50 for one), which my boyfriend loved. I had the Pan con Tomate y Jamon ($10 - the server totally upselled me on this one, dammit), which was fine. Instead of fresh tomato, the bread was served with some kind of tomato jam/chutney, which was decent.\n\nNext came the Red Kale Ensalada ($11) with roasted squash, persimmons, pumpkin seeds, and a warm, Rancho Gordo garbanzo bean dressing. That was, hands down, our favorite dish of the evening. I'm all about kale salads, and I could have eaten about two more orders of this. Fantastic.\n\nThen came the Chicken and English Pea Croquetas ($9 for three --- why is it always in threes?), which to be honest, were quite unremarkable. Crunchy outside and mushy inside, but I've never met a croqueta in my life that I've liked. The croquetas also came with the Wood-Grilled Octopus ($12), which was amazing. The texture of the octopus was perfect; soft, and not rubbery. The fingerling potatoes that accompanied it were properly cooked, creamy, and (naturally) buttery.\n\nAfter that, arrived THE dish that made me want to come here in the first place: The Pluma ($38), which is Iberico pork shoulder served with a honey-chili glaze that comes in a bottle alongside, so that you can glaze to your heart's content. You can tell that this pig, this pata negra, lived a great life. The meat was sweet, although pork shoulder can be a bit tough, which this was. Slightly. The glaze itself is tasty, and I'm sure people love to slather their pork with it, but I used it a bit sparingly. I would have loved to have a side of Maldon/sea/kosher salt. I like my meat simple. I'm kinda like a cavewoman in that way.\n\nI was pretty full by this point, but I *had* to have dessert. You know, for research purposes. We had all of the dessert pinxtos: Manchego cheesecake (YES!) skewer (BOO!) with caramel popcorn, salted caramel skewer (meh -- you've had one salted caramel, you've had them all), pate de fruit skewer (tasty, but you gotta be in the mood for pate de fruit), and two white and dark chocolate-covered olives (this is never a good idea, ever). We also had an amazing apple tart (OMG) served with some Cabrales blue cheese ice cream, which we devoured. I don't remember the prices, but they're in the $4-10 range.\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was a fantastic Latina woman with jet-black, lovely hair. She was fantastic. The rest of the team was also on point, making sure our water glasses were always filled, our napkins were folded upon returning to our chairs, clearing away empty dishes promptly, etc. We showed our appreciation by leaving them more than 20%.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nI really love what they did to that space. The architects and designers managed to create a warm, casual and modern atmosphere out of essentially an old pier in a cold and foggy city. One would think that with all the diners in the room, with all this concrete and huge space, that it would be noisy. It wasn't too bad (and my boyfriend's kind of a low-talker sometimes, and I'm kinda deaf sometimes, and we managed to have a great conversation!). \n\nHowever, the kitchen looked disorganized: Boxes and boxes of I don't know what, stacked 5 high on top of this seemingly 2-story shelf behind the chef's counter, bottles of wine and mezcal on the shelves, mixed with huge jars of pimenton, Asturian beans, and other kitchen staples; behind that, the prep area, with bulk bins, unattended food being prepped (persimmons, peels, etc.) and various supplies. I'm already paying $38 for 8 slices of Iberico pork shoulder. Why do I have to look at this disconnected, disorganized shit? I'm big on details, and they totally missed this one.\n\nAll in all, if you haven't been, definitely go and check it out, whether you like Chiarello or not. I long for the days when the Bay Area can have true tapas bars that are casual, where one can linger with great drinks and nice tapas to nibble on, instead of the bougie \"tapas restaurants\" we're currently stuck with.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Pan con tomate is one the most simple and delicious dishes in Spain ", "and here it is served with burnt toast and canned tomatoes in a bowl, turning\nit into a forgetful dish .

We started our evening waiting for our table at the bar area and had a pre-dinner cocktail there (more about that later.) It was definitely crowded, but there was a nice ocean breeze blowing through. We were then seated at a 5 person table in the dining room. The room has a warm, really jovial feel to it with a beautiful open kitchen. The next time I come, I'd like to sit at the bar seats facing the kitchen so I can watch Chef Michael cook. That would be super fun!\n\nThe drinks:\n1. Barca Gin & Tonic- Now I am NOT a gin girl, but this drink was absolutely amazing. It was so crisp and refreshing and went down incredibly smooth. I would come back just for this cocktail alone.\n2. Tariff Gin & Tonic (minus the iberico)- This just didn't do it for me. I normally love blood orange anything, but this drink was nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe the iberico ham is the x factor that I was missing (since I don't eat red meat.)\n\nTapas Frias (cold tapas):\n3. Baby Beets- this salad with watercress, beet vinaigrette, beet tierra, and blue cheese snow (yes, snow) was really delicious.\n4. White Gazpacho- I am not a huge fan of gazpacho, but this one was creamy, rich, and incredibly flavorful. The almonds really came through each bite.\n\nMontaditos (open-faced sandwiches):\n5. Pan con tomate- this never arrived \n6. Smoked Salmon- I tend to find smoky flavors a little too meaty, but I thoroughly enjoyed the queso fresco truffle honey spread on this dish.\n 7. House-cured chorizo- I don't eat chorizo, but those who did loved this dish so much that they ordered a second round. Must have been pretty great!\n\nTapas Calientes (hot tapas): \n8. \"Tattas\" bravas without ham- these were probably my least favorite item of the night. Vaguely glorified tator-tots. I usually love patatas bravas, so this was a bit disappointing.\n9. Gambas al negro- these head on prawns came in an amazing olive oil, black garlic, chili sauce that was to die for. They seriously need to bottle and sell this sauce alone as a bread-dipping condiment. YUM.\n10. Grilled razor clams- The clams were a little chewy, but the meyer lemon & ramps \"salsa\" mixture on top was super flavorful.\n11. Whole Calamari- These were really fresh and delicious.\n12. Crispy shrimp & chickpea pancake- Definitely one of the highlights of the night. The texture was great and the flavor didn't overpower the shrimp. SO good!\n\nRaciones (family-style):\n13. Arroz con Vieira- This grilled tomato rice was cooked to perfection and the scallops on top were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I wish I could have this alone for dinner once a week. YUM!\n\nDessert\n14. Churros with chocolate sauce- SO amazing! I really really loved the warm flaky churro (and definitely ordered a second round.) Several people at my table may have even been seen eating the chocolate sauce after the churros were finished. \n15. The apple pie- the apples were sliced in a beautiful thin presentation that fun to look at and eat. It was served with a cold blue cheese ice cream.\n16. The cheesecake- they were out of cheesecake which hurt my heart a little bit.\n\n\nA few lows points of the meal:\n\n1. The wait staff was amazingly kind and friendly and incredibly helpful. They seemed to be having some trouble with getting things out or items getting lost between the kitchen and our table. Our first food items came out before our drinks which I found a bit odd. At one point we had only eaten about 4 of the many items we ordered, and we were told we only had 1 item left to come out- very confusing. We had to clarify the long list of dishes that had not yet arrived. Fortunately, our waitress handled all of this in the best way she possibly could- she was incredibly apologetic and helpful. I'm sure these kinks will be worked out in no time.\n\n2. The cana de cobre cheese and pan con tomate never arrived.\n\n3. At two points during the meal I asked Chef Chiarello to take a picture with me.  The first time we were at the bar waiting for our table and I shook his hand and asked and he said he \"would come right back.\" He never returned. I did have a quick 20 second chat with him outside the bathroom though! The second time was about half way through our dinner and he was taking a picture with a neighboring table and my cousin asked on my behalf again and he said \"Sure! Let me just take something off the grill.\" Now I don't think it is necessary for a chef to take pictures with the diners, but given that both times he said he would, I was disappointed. This was especially true because a) I drove 45 minutes each way to eat dinner there because I'm a fan of his and b)  I saw him drinking wine, taking pictures, and chatting with a bunch of other diners, and I felt excluded. Granted, some of them were friends of Chef Chiarello, but still there was no way I'd ask a third time because that would just be lame.

Despite having the kitchen in the same room the place was fairly quiet even when it was packed. I just felt so cool eating at this place. Also its comfy and in a BEAUTIFUL location.\n\nStaff:\nThe staff was professional but incredibly laid back. They were so comfortable with each other and making little jokes left and right.

My only complaint was with the \"bikini\"; although it was still a yummy bite, I thought the blue cheese was just too overpowering. Even the sweet sauce it comes with had to take a back seat to the cheese flavor, and you can forget about tasting anything else they say is in the sandwich. Other than that the dinner courses were top-notch and from what I remember of Spanish food very authentic, though the chef does have his interpretation of things.\nAs for dessert we both enjoyed it but I felt it was of SLIGHTLY lesser quality than the main courses.

As for the pan con chocolate I wouldnt really recommend it, the ice cream is bland and the chocolate cake is not chocolaty... in fact I found it salty if anything.\n\nConclusions:\nThough I may have sounded harsh at times we both loved eating here and once I save up enough money I would be happy to go back again! Definitely the best and most authentic Spanish food in the bay, probably even in all northern California. This is really as good as it gets.\nOne last thing.

Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life. Fruity, refreshing, flavorful, interesting, diverse... maybe next time I'll just order a pitcher (#formyself).

We put in our order for paella first since it takes 45 minutes to make, but so worth the wait! We started with a pitcher of Mexican Sangria, which was cinnamon-y but surprisingly it didn't bother me.

The presentation is beautiful, tastes good and garnished with flowers. Highly recommend if you looking for something not too sweet.\n\nHOUSE CURED BORQUERONES ($2.50/skewer) - white anchovies, olives, pearl onion, guindilla peppers. This was the tiniest skewer I had in my life but the tastiest. Flavorful to the palate, one can taste each layer and then the anchovy towards the end.

Literally, how fancy can you get with a devils egg?! I've had many variations of a devils egg but nothing like this. We ordered another serving because it was very good. Highly recommend.\n\nGAMBAS EL NEGRO ($14) - olive oil pouched head-on gulf prawns with black and garlic chilli sauce. WOW!!! This was the best dish of the night. The sauce drizzled over the prawns did not look anything special but it was. The was the shrimp was prepared was perfect, not under or over cooked. They say the shrimp head has all the juice and flavor. Was never my thing to peal my own shrimp, let alone, suck a shrimp head. I was missing out all my life.

This was also delicious, however the gulf prawns weren't as exciting as the Gambas el Negro. It was enjoyable to have more than one seafood in the dish.

Recommend.\n\nALBONDIGAS AL LA FERIA ($14) - grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and temprannilo salsa, and crispy shallots. Didn't take a bite, I don't eat duck. But from what I've heard, it's delicious!!!! \n\nPULPO A LA PARILLA ($14) - wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potatoes, pimento olive oil. I'm more into baby octopus than regular octopus.

After bringing some friends to the Ferry Building to check stuff out we took out our handy Yelp machines and brought up this place.  So happy to have came--everything was amazingly beautiful.  Food was really great.  And the service was amazing!--the place was full but every waitress and server was so polite and happy, and even encouraged me to take more photos! (and I soooo did!  it was so easy to make everything look great--check my pics out!)\n\n1. Sangria (White Win, Roasted Apples, Spices, House Recipe) 750ml Porron $36:  Despite the involved craft, the taste was not as complex as I was hoping.  It was of course good tasting as expected, but probably not as amazing as the description.  5/10.\n\n2. Salmon Ahumado $8:  Ha ha, so they called this an \"open face sandwich\" but seriously, just call it an hors d oeuvre!  Anyway, these will probably be some of the best smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres you've ever seen.  The honey makes it taste a lot more special.  7/10.\n\n3. Huevos Nacional $7:  Like many of the others, this is a masterfully re-envisioned version of a traditional dish.  Never had any deviled eggs like this!  Stuffed with spring peas and smoked pimenton alioli they say.  Very unique.  8/10.\n\n4. Patatas Bravas $8:  Hmmm, very interesting one here.  I would say this would kinda be like an ultra fancy version of tater tots, you know, if you used purple potatoes, smoked them, and made up a fancy dip.  You do taste the special taste of the fresh and fancy potatoes, but personally to me I'd go for a bit more kick.  Sauce is very slightly hot, but barely--could use a bit more heat.  The meat looks beautiful though!  7/10.\n\n5. Croquetas de Pollo $9:  Mmmmmm.... kinda reminds me of similar creations from Porto's in Glendale, but for 2x the price, ha ha.  Probably would fall in the \"comfort food\" category.  Tastes yummy though!  7/10.\n\n6. Albondigas a la Feria $14:  The most unique and complex meatballs I've ever had.  The meat is very soft and juicy on the inside, and though does resemble an Italian meatball, somehow manages to taste and feel totally different!  The outside flavor and sauce is quite strong and distinct.  I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.

If I were to be really picky, the only thing that would probably bother me is the size of the pintxos; they were much smaller than we were expecting for $2.50 each. They were more like a nibble than a bite.

The Barca Gintonic was definitely the highlight, it was gorgeous! It's a must have when you go there!\n\nThe hubby's highlight were the roasted peppers, they had a lot of flavor especially with the slivers of jamon on top. The octopus was nice and soft and the grilled sausages were also very flavorful; I especially enjoyed the blood sausage. Believe it or not my most favorite thing to eat were the greens, they came in a nice bown and were bitter, yet sweet; they went well with everything.\n\nNow, I'm a big coffee and dessert person but by the end of our meal we were the last ones in the restaurant and I could tell the staff were preparing to close. I got shy and didn't end up ordering dessert even though our server suggested we still could. The reason for the five stars is that she ended up bringing us dessert anyway which were the cheesecake bites! I was so delighted that I got my little dessert at the end of the meal; for free!

It was definitely one of my favorite dishes that night\n- Pulpo a la Parilla: the grilled octopus was tender and juicy and had great flavoring to it\n\nI thought the Sunny Side-up Huevo was a little too salty, and everything else, though delicious, I could do without ordering again (just based on personal preference; they were still excellent dishes).\n\nWe wanted to try the Spanish rice dish but were told it takes a long time to prepare and that they had to free up our table for the next party. I believe they have a limit of 90 minutes when you're dining there and it's easy to see why. We had stayed for 2 hours at that point and were still trying to order the rest of the menu... haha.

Being huge fans of Bottega (where we ate the night before), we had high expectations for Coqueta, but have to say food was just okay for the money.  Being right on the water the space has a great feel and the staff in general was great, but from the second you walk in you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for everything (which is the opposite of Bottega).  We went expecting to drop a bomb on food as that was kind of the point of this splurge trip to San Francisco, so didn't mind the high menu prices, but rather the way things were forced on you.  For instance, as soon as you sit down they bring you a tray with about 2 dozen \"bite sized skewers\" (Pintxos) which they present as an amuse-bouche (which is almost expected at nicer restaurants these days); however, once you take one, waitress explains they are $2.50 each (really not worth it for food that has just been sitting out and visited every table in restaurant...ick....and yes, I have spent time in Spain, where this is done at bars, but this just feels wrong). \nMoving on, we each ordered about 2 Tapas plates (there were 4 of us) and Paella....we were going to add on more but waitress said it would be plenty of food.  Since on the topic of pricing, I have to jump forward to our bill before covering food flavor.  When we got our bill we were surprised to to see that we had been charged extra for every single dish...presumably to make it split-able for 4 people....the problem is that the waitress made no mention of this and we did not tell her we wanted to split the dishes (in fact some of the dishes were for certain people as other people at table had food issues and could not split).  It would have been totally been fine if she mentioned this, but instead just decided to add this to our bill which just seemed slimy.\nOkay, so onto the food.\nCroquetas De Pollo:  Tasty fried croquettes....hard to screw up something like this so obviously good.\nGambas al Negor:  Very good and has a nice kick to it with the pepper.\nTotillita de Camaron: Everyone felt this was okay but not great.\nPulpo a la Parilla:  The grilled octopus was highlight of entire meal and wish I just ordered several plates of it.  It was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth.\nAlbondigas a la Feria: The duck meatballs just felt kind felt kind of flat.  Maybe it was that the cherry sauce was too weak....raspberry would make it a million times better.\nPatatas Xips e Salsa Apertivo: The chips are great, but $7 for 6 small potato chips is just ridiculous (this should be something they just include with the meal).\nHuevos Nacional: Great presentation and overall taste, but the bonito essentially tastes like chicken of the sea.\nEsparrago Trigeros con Remesco: excellent flavor and taste.\nEnsalada de Remolacha:  good, but ridiculously small serving size.\nPaella: Says it serves 2-3, but really the seafood is about enough for 1.5, and the rice is for 3.  It was okay, but dry and really not any better than any standard corner Spanish restaurant (which we have a lot of in NYC).\n\nBy the way, the Sangria is really nice and light and refreshing.\n\nIn summary, it is good and has a great atmosphere, but we weren't blown away and while we expected to spend a lot, felt deceived by how hidden costs were added to the bill.\n\nFinally, I have to say that  I am impressed with how present Michael Chiarello is at his restaurants.

These are tapas and are not meant to fill you up or serve as an entire main dinner. If you're looking for that, try some of their larger-sized items.

But you're in San Francisco should this is the new reality and with a stunning destination like the reclaimed Pier that Coqueta makes its home, you better believe you are paying for the ambiance in addition to the food they serve. I went to Coqueta only once before, when Chef Michael Chiarello first opening his newest jewel a few years ago and I remembered seeing him cook in the small open kitchen and then walk around and greet his diners. Those days are long gone, but what isn't gone is the large crowds that arrive night in and night out. \n\nThis time around, a friend asked where would I like to eat, and knowing it was a Saturday night, and I was taking BART across the bay, one of the easiest places to get a unique meal was back at Coqueta. With a 7:30pm reservation in hand, we made our way there, once again forgetting that their small entrance is right where the glass of their interior bar meets the cement blocks of where their main dining room and open kitchen resides. With our 7:30pm reservation, the best we could do is get two seats at the bar and I really liked sitting there as opposed to a small two top table because we could see all the cooking going on and you could see some of their handmade Pintxos, otherwise known as bite-size skewers, up close ready to be cooked over a flame. And judging by the size of those small little skewers we already knew we did not want to order those!\n\nBut first we knew we were deciding on cocktails as the bar makes some of the most unique drinks along the bay, with mojitos and margaritas in check filled with lots of visually tantalizing things like edible wildflowers you couldn't go wrong. My dining companion wanted something summery and was thrilled with the price of their Sangria made with red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile and local apples at 9 dollars a glass you couldn't beat this house recipe. I was looking for something more exotic, so I decided to go with the Beso de Carca made with Pueblo Viejo Blanco, lime, raspberry-jalapeno sugar Rose \"Air\" it was a smooth and spicy cocktail that went down just right at an affordable 12 dollars a glass.\n\nFor our dinner, they have a lot of choices on the menu at Coqueta that perfectly encompass what it's like to dine in Spain, from sliced cured meats to Iberian cheeses to Pintxos otherwise known as bite-size skewers they seem to be a fully realized concept that takes you to Spain and back. From their Hot Tapas menu we decided to go with the \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts and topped with chili de arbol and chorizo dressing and the Albondigas a la Feria which were duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots. Both dishes were prepared with such detail, the sunny side up huevo was a rich breakfast dish made especially for dinner and the meatballs were tart yet tasty. For our entree, my dining mate and I decided to split the Lubina a la Brasa which is a wood grilled and semi-boneless Branzino with Manzanilla olive and preserved meyer lemon salsa paired with the Ensalada de Kale which had Lacinto Kale, cana de Cabra, pistachio, tangerine confitura, pickled green strawberries with warm fresh fava and English pea dressing. The branzino was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection and the saltiness of the fish went well with the tartness of the lemon salsa and it paired perfectly with the kale salad. In fact, it was one of the best salads I have ever tasted, yes it was that good.\n\nCoqueta lives up the billing as a unique places for authentic tapas on San Francisco's Embarcadero. For a Saturday night in the freezing cold of winter, the place was packed. We loved sitting on the counter, although we didn't get a great view of the open kitchen, as we literally looked at raw skewers in a glass case, they still had a great energy with all those people inside. It was a little hard to move around but a fun experience nonetheless. I would consider returning for a special occasion as the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get on your dish. But the menu is well-conceived and prepared with a lot of flavor and for that I think Coqueta is the jewel along San Francisco Bay.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-03-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Gambas, Ensalada de Kale, Goucho, all a good pick!"], "author": "Head Chef F.", "review": "Very nice..\n\nNot your typical authentic tapas yet nice..\nGambas, Ensalada de Kale, Goucho, all a good pick!", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-08-26"}, {"excerpts": ["- Croquetas de Pollo Chicharron w/ crusted Chickenand English pea croquetas with cured seasonalcitrus\n- Ensalada de Kale lacinato kale, roasted squash, quince confitura, pomegranate, warm Garbanzo dressing (", "best kale salad ever)\n- Pulpo a la Plancha mediterranean octopus with freshly dug fingerling potato and piment\u00f3n olive oil \n- Alb\u00f3ndigas a la Feria duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot"], "author": "Jenn L.", "review": "I love Coqueta.

He happily answered our menu questions and opined on some of his favorites.  We tried to get a varied selection and ended with:\n\nJamon Iberico de Bellota.  What more can I say about Iberico Jamon? Had this is Spain and ever time dining at Spanish restaurants here. It's simply the tastiest cured meat. \n\nCroquetas de Pollo - 3 skewers of Chicharron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured seasonal citrus. You complement the croqueta with the citrus.  It looked simple, but it was delicious.  \n\nPatatas Bravas - 12 lightly smoked, crispy potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic aioli.   I love potatoes and this was an interesting creation.  They were lightly coated, fried and topped with a dap of aioli. I liked it without dipping it into the salsa. \n\nSalmon Ahumado - 2 smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey on bread. Generous amount of salmon on each bread.  Though this might not appear t to be a Spanish dish, it was never the less, quite tasty.   \n\nPluma - acorn fed Spanish Iberico de Bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze.  Wow! The Iberico was so moist and tasty.  I could have eaten a lot more of this. \n\nChurros \"Fantasia\" - 4 crispy Spanish doughnuts with drinking chocolate and mixed berry powder.  You dunk your square shaped churros into the chocolate, which was not think or overly sweet. You can dap some concentrated berry powder on it for a contrasting taste. \n\nThis was one of the best Spanish meals that I've had Stateside where the tapas reminded me of ones I had in Spain.

My favorite part has got to be the tiny thin slices of cured meat sprinkled all over the peppers, yum!\n- Gambas Negras: this shrimp dish with crispy bread was delicious. Slight unfreshness in the shrimp but the flavor they masked it with was really good. The black garlic chili sauce was super good to keep around after so you can dip your bread in it too.\n- Pulpo a la Parrilla: grilled octopus goodness! I ordered this each time i came. A fan of the soft octopus texture in every bite. \n- Paella: my favorite and a must-order dish! The crispy rice on the edges of the pan is my favorite with such a rich aroma and taste in every bite.

Really. \n\nDetails to follow, but first, a couple of quick tips. First, know that it's best to make reservations weeks ahead. We went on a rainy weekday and it was packed. Second, know that if you can't get a table, everything on the menu is available at the bar or outside on the small patio in front. \n\nLet's start with the ambience. It's busy, fairly noisy but I had no trouble hearing my companions. Great vibe and we loved the decor, clean and warm. Notice the painting on the wall which used cracks and such to make animals and figures in the Spanish theme. \n\nService was great. Our server was available whenever we needed her and knew the menu items perfectly. \n\nNot an inexpensive place but for food this good, on the wharf, and this well known, it was very reasonable. We ordered a lot, stayed for a couple of hours, and left for about $75 each -- with 12 items plus drinks, dessert, coffee (for five people). Portions are quite decent -- you certainly do not need to sample as many as we did! You could have a very nice meal for $40 each. \n\nOK, the food. Ahhh, the food! Overall, every dish was at least good and most were excellent, with several standouts. Flavors were complex but never muddled, everything was prepared perfectly, and the balance of interesting flavors was flawless. Start with top-quality Spanish ingredients like iberian ham and overlay the smoky, hot touch from their open fire grill, sauce it right, and you get the idea. If you appreciate the design of a perfect bite, you will be delighted and surprised in dish after dish. \n\nHighlights:\n\nThe charcuterie plate is amazing. A $38 splurge but a fair value, with probably a dozen meats and cheeses, everything top quality. \n\nIberico lardo served atop sea urchin roe (uni). Wow. Had this again on my second visit and it was even better than I remembered. The uni melds with the hot, smoky fat from the lardo so it doesn't taste particularly like unit -- instead you get the creamy texture, the richness, the fresh umami, and an afterrush of briny sea. This is such a perfect bite.\n\nPatatas bravas are tiny potatoes (\"freshly dug,\" says the menu in a rare bit of ostentation), coated and fried to be crispy shelled and creamy inside, served in a ring with a wonderful salsa in the middle and topped with aioli. \n\nCurly mustard and chard with plumped raisins, pine nuts, and a caper-raisin puree. Bitter greens and sweet bits for balance. Rather oily but I liked it that way. \n\nShrimp served with crispy potato garlic chips and a sunny-side up egg: Mix it all up before serving.\n\nI was blown away with the seemingly-simple smoked salmon made spectacular with truffled honey! Truffles and honey did not seem like the perfect pairing that it was. Smart.\n\nAnother surprise was the chicharron-crusted chicken which was bursting with juiciness, meaty and bold. Served with lively citrus skewers.\n\nOh, and the albondigas (meatballs). I love ordering albondigas because it's fun to say, all the better when they're so rich and meaty. Duck and pork with crispy shallots and a rich sauce.\n\nSave room, because the desserts are terrific. \n\nFlan del rey with caramelized apple pur\u00e9e, sherry-poached little spheres of apple with blue cheese. Whoa. \n\nSpanish brandy ice cream with hot espresso pour on top.\n\nAnd this was amazing: Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche: Warm molten arroz con leche cake with huckleberries and arroz con leche ice cream. The huckleberries, reduced to a jam, were a standout to me, playing off the cream and the cake, richly fruity. \n\nEven the coffee was standout-rich. \n\nOh, and I almost forgot the cocktails. Love a cocktail that has a blend of ingredients so well-balanced that the flavors are distinct but it's hard to identify what's there. The one I loved the best was De Copas con Dali with white vermouth, campari, orange, lemon, cava rose. And on my second visit, there was another cocktail from bourbon finished with mint that was great; sorry I don't have better notes on this one. \n\nWell, if you read this far, thank you.

That's when!\"\n\n~3 years ago, the [charming] Italian Food Network personality opened this Spanish tapas restaurant on the Embarcadero waterfront. They serve many Spanish staples, including Spanish cured meats and cheeses, pintxos, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella. Trust a renowned chef like Michael Chiarello to wonderfully elevate Spanish flavors with his own delicious flare.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing here: PLUMA, which is a honey-chili glazed, acorn-fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin (aka the creme de la creme of Spanish piggies). It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish. I'm even obsessed with the bottle of extra HONEY-CHILI GLAZE that it's served with. It is really so fantastic that if I could I would regularly pair it with the many, many steaks that I eat.\n\nThe pulpo a la parilla is also worth ordering, as it's executed just as perfectly as the wood-grilled octopus at Bottega (aka my favorite octopus) with the additional pleasure of that pimenton oil. Yum!\n\nPutting my fangirl enthusiasm aside, Coqueta is good but not good enough to be on my regular rotation of Spanish restaurants. For one, it's a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're not in a big group and want to sample everything (or on a date, for instance). Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest. The Barca gintonic is arguably the best gin & tonic in the city. It's such a beautiful drink with vibrant flavors to match. I was also pleasantly surprised that you can order a porron of wine, which is SUCH a Spanish novelty. I have a porron from Spanish relatives just collecting dust at my house, but seeing it at Coqueta makes me want to bring back the joy of spilling wine everywhere.\n\nOther notes:\n-Open late\n-Front area is nice for hanging out but can get really competitive for space\n-Olives are from the Chiarello Vineyards, not Spain", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Patatas Bravas ( Super crunchy and tender) \n2.

This is a must order!\n\nPaella -- http://bit.ly/1BEIXnH\nBomba rice, Jamon Serrano-Shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, cauliflower and lemon aioli.\nThis Paella is awesome!  Visually and substantially!  You'd think that even though you're at a fancy restaurant, the portion would be small, but this was a perfectly portioned paella for my group.  It came with huge shrimp and was loaded everything listed above.  Why didn't I order this before???\n\nOverall the dinner was a great experience.  Everyone at the table enjoyed our waiter's personal selections.  When I came back again with another group of friends about a month later for lunch, we pretty much ordered the same things above, plus a few things I had from my past visits like their Duck and Pork Albondigas and Patatas Bravas.  All was good and they didn't miss a beat with any of this things we ordered.\n\nAfter having dinner and lunch here again, it's no wonder why Coqueta is still one of my favorite places to dine in the city.  So much variety on their menu, a great place to dine with group of friends or dining solo, and their bar is a great spot to hangout.

I started with The Flaca, which had gin, lemon tonic and hard cider. It was a refreshing and served in a champagne glass.  Just what I needed to start with on a hot night. \n\nBeing housed in an old ferry building, gives the place high, beautiful ceilings with large windows for letting that bay breeze inside to cool things down.  They also have a small outside patio and a bar that is enclosed, that is first come first served if you don't have a reservation, a nice thing to know if you show up with out reseses.  \n\nWe started with the meat and cheese plate and how can you go wrong with freshly shaved Iberico ham and Serrano.  Yum!  From there we split a 4-5 tapas, which was perfect for our group of 4.  We stayed away from the three large plates, opting to sample more variety than waste money on an expensive main course.    The stand outs were the Patatas Bravas, perfectly salty crispy tiny round potatoes with garlic aioli.  Duck and pork meatballs were also a favorite, with the tangy sweet cherry salsa.  Definitely have 1 or 5 of the skewers, I especially loved the pickled quail egg with serrano.  Mmm, serrano.  \n\nThe star of dessert time was the Carajillo, a Spanish brandy ice cream with hot espresso poured on top.

I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.  Flavor was great though, but unlike the others maybe somewhat traditional.  The drinking chocolate was good but could use more spice.  The sour powder was badass though--great kick.  5/10.\n\nWorks of art to eat.  Wonderful service.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life.

I was in luck when I got reservation!\n\nWe got there early and was seated in a room that is adjacent to the actual dining area, this area has the bar and a few seats where people sat and drank as well. We ordered a drink to start the night, the Kalimotxo which has Mexican Coke, Red Sangria, and Cinnamon. This drink was full of flavor but resides a bit on the dry side. It is only served in a party pitcher (500 mL). \n\nWe were shown to our seats promptly, matter of fact, 10 minutes before our actual reservation time.  Our server, Lowell was AWESOME from the beginning. He is very knowledgeable of all the amazing food and drinks Coqueta serves. After we looked at the menu and made our choices, he picked and chose the order of our food and he was spot on! \n\nUnfortunately, I really wanted to try the \"Mar y Montana\", but they were sold out of the sea urchin (this gives me the perfect excuse to come back!).\n\nThe patatas bravas (freshly dug, crispy new potatoes, lightly smoked, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli). It was flavorful and the potatoes are perfect bite size pieces. The garlic alioli and salsa help brought out the flavor of the smoked potatoes. There was a great balance of salty and sweet.\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas (served alongside with cured cara-cara orange) (3 pieces). These puppies were like mini pot pies, bursting with richness in flavor! Super creamy and packed with great seasoning. The cured orange was served alongside with the croquetas, but I didn't try them. \n\nGambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on Gulf prawns with black garlic and chili). This was an amazing dish. Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert.

I grew up in Spain, M\u00e1laga to be exact. Spanish food is in my veins. I know it inside and out. I know what is customarily served in restaurants and HOW and what is must taste like.\n\nThis place? This place does NOT serve Spanish food! If ever I were to bring a fellow Spaniard to this place they would never speak to me again, insulted beyond what words can convey that I would be stupid enough to even so much as suggest that the abominations served there are Spanish food. It was THAT bad. Horrible. Bad, Disgusting. Nasty. So, SO nasty!\n\nThe portions were insanely tiny. ALL the above overpriced food together would constitute one full dinner plate's worth of food.

The pulpo, my husband informed me (and I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian) was tasteless and bland and just bad. So, SO bad. The esp\u00e1rragos, br\u00f3coli, verduras a la catalana and setas all ajillo all might as well have been the same dish. Taste? Burned. Bitter. Crunchy because it was THAT burned. Charred. Disgusting. Overly chewy. Bad. So, SO bad. Did I say disgusting? Bitter? Burned? Charred? And bad? So, SO bad? Because it bears repeating it was THAT bad!\n\nA typical Spanish restaurant will serve a nice slab of sliced French bread with butter or olive oil as something to munch on until the appetizers and the food arrive but there was no bread to be had. The patatas chips (or just plain ol' chips with some manchego on top) are NOT a Spanish dish served at restaurants! Believe it or not, we buy chips and eat them out of bags there too and don't pretend to grab some cheap ass chips, sprinkle manchego on them and call it a dish! But it was the closest thing to anything appetizing for the kids to eat and, in all honesty, was probably the ONLY thing that did not make us want to smash our heads up against a wall because THAT would be more delightful than having to take one more bite of the atrocious, charred, bitter and plain disgusting food served at Coqueta.\n\nIn the almost twenty years I have lived here in San Francisco, this is by far THE worse dining experience we have EVER had EVER, ANYWHERE!

Worst food I have ever had ANYWHERE globally speaking. \n\nEVER.\n\nANYWHERE\n\nBecause, again, it bears repeating in case you didn't quite get it.\n\nAnd all those teeny tiny portions that barely made up one full dinner plate's worth of food? $90.

He said it was the closest flavors to what he experiences in Spain. He lives in Barcelona six months out of the year. My wife and I visited Spain about 17 months ago and fell in love with the people as well as the food. I also cook Spanish food and paella is one of my specialties. With that being said, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I brought my wife and my mom on this special trip. We arrived 16 April on a Saturday shortly after they opened at 11:30am. We didn't have reservations so they sat us in the bar, which is where we usually prefer to sit anyway. The first thing we noticed was the infestation of flies flying overhead. I mean there must have been close to a couple dozen flying in a group. My mother had a hard time getting up on the bar stool and with the flies near us we decided to sit outside on the bench and picnic table where not a single fly bothered us. I immediately ordered the seafood paella since I knew this would take some time to cook. We also ordered one each of white wine and red wine Sangrias. Both were excellent, but the white was my favorite. We started with El Plat Cap a Chef's selection of cured meats. It consisted of house cured chorizo, fu\u00e9t, and Jam\u00f3n Serrano. First of all the portions were minuscule. For $26 I expected a little more on the platter. The slightly larger than a match stick sized and rectangular shaped salami was underwhelming. The chorizo had little flavor, was not bad, but no wow factor. The Jam\u00f3n Serrano was also underwhelming. All three lacked saltiness and more fat content. Next we ordered hot tapas. Patatas Bravas: very good with hints of smokiness and flash fried crisp served with Bravas salsa and garlic aioli, Pulpo a la Parilla: Wood grilled Mediterranean octopus served with fingerling potatoes and piment\u00f3n olive oil which was cooked perfectly. Although we weren't served a single tentacle, which is my favorite part of the octopus, but what was served was very good. Our last tapas was Alb\u00f3ndigas a la feria, duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry Tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot. These were slightly sweet, tart, tender, and moist. Good, but no wow factor here either. Lastly our paella was served. This was probably our biggest disappointment. I am use to saffron in my paella, which is synonymous with paella. Not a hint was detected. Not enough seafood broth was used either. First of all I couldn't detect any flavors of seafood. The paella had primarily tomato based flavors instead. As a result of not enough broth being used. the paella was dry. The clams were cooked nicely, but the shrimp was kind of mushy in texture, not firm. The house cured chorizo lacked flavor and probably did not belong in this dish. It provided a waxy tasteless texture. For $45 this was a huge failure. I had Mexican (Spanish) rice in a Mexican restaurant more flavorful than this.

It feels like it's separated into 2 different rooms both daily small; one it's just sitting area with the kitchen in front of you if you're sitting around the counter area and another seating area, you have a bar. They have a wide range of liquor sand also pretty interesting cocktails. We made a reservation and got there 10 minutes before but still had to wait 20 minutes for a table because they happened to have a huge group that's seated. The service was actually pretty decent. \n\nThere's so many options in tapas whether it's hot or cold. They also have a few selections on cured meats, cheese platters, and the bite size skewers. They do have big plates (family/entree size). We were about to order the bite size skewers but none of them have meat in them so we passed on that. We wanted to try a lot of items on their menu so we didn't order any big/entree plates. \n\nWe ordered the deviled eggs and it's pretty creamy, but I think they can do a little better on the toppings. The croquetas de pollo is a MUST try dish! It's deep fried and crispy on the outside but very flavorful and creamy on the inside. They also give you little orange  slices which I guess it's to cleanse your palettes. The patatas bravas is a little different. It's mini fried potato balls that has a smokey taste, but I do love the dipping sauce and it does make a difference in terms of taste. The gambas al negro (prawns in olive oil and garlic sauce with toasted French bread, is okay because you can eat this anywhere. The sunny side up surprisingly tasted a little like kimchi fried rice without the kimchi and rice and it's actually pretty good. It also comes with crispy thinly sliced potatoes which reminds me of very fresh hash browns. Our last tapas was the duck and pork meatballs. It's a little on the sweeter side, wish it's more savory.\n\nOf course we ordered desserts too. We ordered the flan and the bite size cheesecake. The flan was perfect in texture and taste, not too sweet, and it has fresh blackberries with it so it's more healthy. On the other hand, the bite size cheesecake was way too sweet and heavy.

The table is set really close to the bench, and if I was just one month more pregnant (or on the heftier side), I don't think I would have been able to squeeze through onto the bench.

I admit my value perception may be a bit tainted by the fact my preggers state meant I couldn't enjoy any of the cured meats or the manchego cheese since it was made with raw goat's milk.  I loved the Valdeon blue cheese, but it overpowered my palette, so I couldn't really taste any distinctive flavor with the Cana de Cabra soft goat cheese.\n\nCrispy Shrimp & Chickpea Flour Pancake - I love all things deep fried, and this did not disappoint.  I like my citrus, so I probably would have enjoyed a bit more of the roaster meyer lemon to squeeze on top.\n\nWood Grilled Octopus - Super tender (not overcooked and rubbery), well-seasoned, and a delightful recommendation from someone else that insisted we order it.\n\nDuck & Pork Albondigas and Beef Shortribs - Both good, but unremarkable.\n\nIf I come again, I'd skip the Apple and Pear Ensalada and Patatas Bravas.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-01-29"}, {"excerpts": ["The patatas bravas, chicken and pea croqettes and warm chocolate cake were there other all stars of the meal.

At first, I had no idea if I was approaching a hostess - she wasn't wearing any sort of uniform (she was dressed even more casually than I was) and she didn't say anything to me - so after a few seconds of staring at each other, I took a leap of faith and told her that I had a reservation.  Thankfully, I was correct but it was a little odd to me that she didn't say anything first - if you don't have a uniform or dress code, how am I suppose to know that you're a hostess if you don't say anything?  Strange.  \n\nMy family and I were shown to our table promptly - truthfully, I was disappointed.  If you make reservations weeks in advance, you'd think that they'd have one of the best tables set aside for you....we were seated by the door in the middle of a high traffic zone - flies kept buzzing around our food and drinks.  When I went to Bottega for my birthday last year, the staff selected a wonderful table on their patio and even had a little card with a birthday greeting - it was seriously awesome.  Coqueta had neither of those.  A smidge disappointing... \n\nWhile the staff offered water promptly - it was awhile before we were acknowledged by our server.  But, thankfully, it was all up hill from here - our server was very sweet and helpful.

"], "author": "Gary C.", "review": "We'd come into Coqueta full of high hopes. Spanish cuisine is our favorite. We've traveled extensively in Catalonia and have eaten at most of the great restaurants as well as many neighborhood Tapas places from Barcelona to San Sebastien. Additionally we are big fans of Michael Chiarrello's Bodega in Yountville. We were excited to get in on opening night. Now, we've been to many restaurant openings (and soft openings) and expect some rough edges. So, this past Saturday night we were not expecting perfection but rather a promise of a great Spanish restaurant. We have several good but no great Spanish places in SF.\n\nBeing walk-ins, we were, understandably, relegated to the enclosed, outdoor patio area. Unfortunately we were against the far wall. The bar/table was very narrow and maneuvering plates was tricky. The stools (no chairs in this spot) were small and hard...perhaps one step better than sitting on upwardly protruding nails. I stood for dinner. This space consists of parallel walls of glass and hard surfaces. This is the ideal area for an obscenely loud, a screamingly loud, environment. After a few drinks a lot of the younger gals at the bar just shrieked to be heard. It was on the verge of actual physical pain. Why in the world don't restaurant designers think about these things. The main room, on the other hand, had a far more relaxed, civilized environment...lacking none of the buzz but also allowing for conversation. \n\nThe service was just a bit rough...totally to be expected and maybe a bit better than I was hoping for. The waiter was patient and good natured. On the other hand, another waiter brought me an order of razor clams when I'd ordered the savory Manila clams and tried to convince me that what he was giving me was what I'd ordered. We both knew better. \n\nNow for the food. The phrase that comes to mind is \"tourist trade.\"  The food was so very disappointing both in preparation and conception. The Savory clams arrived barely warm. The Jamon Iberico de Bellota was sliced too thick and served with croutons rather than bread. The portion size was *far* too small for $30. I know what this kind of jamon costs it ain't cheap. However, there is no excuse for the meager portion of the lack of art in slicing it. The marcona almonds were fine. The Chicken and English pea croquets with cured cara-cara oranges was the best dish of the evening. Very good...the oranges made the dish. The Roasted Padron peppers with Jamon Serrano was OK. The peppers a bit mushy. The \"Tatta\" Bravas were a joke...watery tater tots. How do you screw up an iconic dish so badly? Why screw with patatas bravas like this? Ego?\n\nHow did this place wind up like this? I can forgive the opening night jitters and rough edges and the outside space need a dramatic rethink. The menu...at least what we had...was such a major disappointment that I don't think we'll bother coming back.\n\n1.5 stars", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-04-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Great tapas over all, not so crazy about their patatas bravas, but all other bocaditos, are always great.

We started our evening waiting for our table at the bar area and had a pre-dinner cocktail there (more about that later.) It was definitely crowded, but there was a nice ocean breeze blowing through. We were then seated at a 5 person table in the dining room. The room has a warm, really jovial feel to it with a beautiful open kitchen. The next time I come, I'd like to sit at the bar seats facing the kitchen so I can watch Chef Michael cook. That would be super fun!\n\nThe drinks:\n1. Barca Gin & Tonic- Now I am NOT a gin girl, but this drink was absolutely amazing. It was so crisp and refreshing and went down incredibly smooth. I would come back just for this cocktail alone.\n2. Tariff Gin & Tonic (minus the iberico)- This just didn't do it for me. I normally love blood orange anything, but this drink was nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe the iberico ham is the x factor that I was missing (since I don't eat red meat.)\n\nTapas Frias (cold tapas):\n3. Baby Beets- this salad with watercress, beet vinaigrette, beet tierra, and blue cheese snow (yes, snow) was really delicious.\n4. White Gazpacho- I am not a huge fan of gazpacho, but this one was creamy, rich, and incredibly flavorful. The almonds really came through each bite.\n\nMontaditos (open-faced sandwiches):\n5. Pan con tomate- this never arrived \n6. Smoked Salmon- I tend to find smoky flavors a little too meaty, but I thoroughly enjoyed the queso fresco truffle honey spread on this dish.\n 7. House-cured chorizo- I don't eat chorizo, but those who did loved this dish so much that they ordered a second round. Must have been pretty great!\n\nTapas Calientes (hot tapas): \n8. \"Tattas\" bravas without ham- these were probably my least favorite item of the night. Vaguely glorified tator-tots. I usually love patatas bravas, so this was a bit disappointing.\n9. Gambas al negro- these head on prawns came in an amazing olive oil, black garlic, chili sauce that was to die for. They seriously need to bottle and sell this sauce alone as a bread-dipping condiment. YUM.\n10. Grilled razor clams- The clams were a little chewy, but the meyer lemon & ramps \"salsa\" mixture on top was super flavorful.\n11. Whole Calamari- These were really fresh and delicious.\n12. Crispy shrimp & chickpea pancake- Definitely one of the highlights of the night. The texture was great and the flavor didn't overpower the shrimp. SO good!\n\nRaciones (family-style):\n13. Arroz con Vieira- This grilled tomato rice was cooked to perfection and the scallops on top were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I wish I could have this alone for dinner once a week. YUM!\n\nDessert\n14. Churros with chocolate sauce- SO amazing! I really really loved the warm flaky churro (and definitely ordered a second round.) Several people at my table may have even been seen eating the chocolate sauce after the churros were finished. \n15. The apple pie- the apples were sliced in a beautiful thin presentation that fun to look at and eat. It was served with a cold blue cheese ice cream.\n16. The cheesecake- they were out of cheesecake which hurt my heart a little bit.\n\n\nA few lows points of the meal:\n\n1. The wait staff was amazingly kind and friendly and incredibly helpful. They seemed to be having some trouble with getting things out or items getting lost between the kitchen and our table. Our first food items came out before our drinks which I found a bit odd. At one point we had only eaten about 4 of the many items we ordered, and we were told we only had 1 item left to come out- very confusing. We had to clarify the long list of dishes that had not yet arrived. Fortunately, our waitress handled all of this in the best way she possibly could- she was incredibly apologetic and helpful. I'm sure these kinks will be worked out in no time.\n\n2. The cana de cobre cheese and pan con tomate never arrived.\n\n3. At two points during the meal I asked Chef Chiarello to take a picture with me.  The first time we were at the bar waiting for our table and I shook his hand and asked and he said he \"would come right back.\" He never returned. I did have a quick 20 second chat with him outside the bathroom though! The second time was about half way through our dinner and he was taking a picture with a neighboring table and my cousin asked on my behalf again and he said \"Sure! Let me just take something off the grill.\" Now I don't think it is necessary for a chef to take pictures with the diners, but given that both times he said he would, I was disappointed. This was especially true because a) I drove 45 minutes each way to eat dinner there because I'm a fan of his and b)  I saw him drinking wine, taking pictures, and chatting with a bunch of other diners, and I felt excluded. Granted, some of them were friends of Chef Chiarello, but still there was no way I'd ask a third time because that would just be lame.

We had heard good things about it and she had never had Spanish food so I thought it would be a god idea to go.

Despite having the kitchen in the same room the place was fairly quiet even when it was packed. I just felt so cool eating at this place. Also its comfy and in a BEAUTIFUL location.\n\nStaff:\nThe staff was professional but incredibly laid back. They were so comfortable with each other and making little jokes left and right. My only complaint was that there were lots of staff members which just seemed excessive to me, considering they tended to leave us alone for the most part.\n\nFood:\n-We got: Pan con tomate (with ham), an organic tomato salad (special), patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, the \"Bakini\" (basically an eggplant sandwich), Chesecake, Chocolate fantasia and the pan con chocolate. \n\nNOTE this was about $75 before the tip if youre hungry id expect to pay about 30 to 40 a person.\n\nSo we ordered what seems like a lot of food but the portions here are small!

My only complaint was with the \"bikini\"; although it was still a yummy bite, I thought the blue cheese was just too overpowering. Even the sweet sauce it comes with had to take a back seat to the cheese flavor, and you can forget about tasting anything else they say is in the sandwich. Other than that the dinner courses were top-notch and from what I remember of Spanish food very authentic, though the chef does have his interpretation of things.\nAs for dessert we both enjoyed it but I felt it was of SLIGHTLY lesser quality than the main courses. That being said, if youre coming here I recommend getting at least the Curros and chocolate dish, if you like cheesy cheesecake then youll like theirs. As for the pan con chocolate I wouldnt really recommend it, the ice cream is bland and the chocolate cake is not chocolaty... in fact I found it salty if anything.\n\nConclusions:\nThough I may have sounded harsh at times we both loved eating here and once I save up enough money I would be happy to go back again! Definitely the best and most authentic Spanish food in the bay, probably even in all northern California. This is really as good as it gets.\nOne last thing.

We then proceeded to order our fair share of tapas including, roasted padron peppers, patatas bravas, tortilla spagnola (called \"Andres\" here), crispy shrimp in a chickpea flour pancake, grilled albondigas, chicken & english pea croquettes -- each tapas was well seasoned, beautifully presented and more importantly so full of umami with a nod to authentic Catalan cuisine with the freshness of California produce.  Cal Pep would be proud of this place.\n\nWe ended our meal by sharing the Fideua, a traditional Catalan noodle dish similar to paella.  The dish came with a number of large tender shrimp and Iberico ham.  It was a really good version, almost as good as the one hubby and I had in Stiges at a fabulous beachside restaurant called La Santa Maria (but perhaps the setting played a part in why their fideua is still so memorable to me today).\n\nService was impeccable -- hats off to the maitre d' for running a tight ship.  Our server, Moe, was congenial, efficient and balanced the right amount of friendliness with professionalism.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful to look at and I love the bar seating to table ratio -- any restaurants with a pintxos bar needs a large bar!\n\nI have never done this before to an opening night, but I am so excited with this restaurant that it truly deserves five stars.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Loved the crispy shrimp and chick pea pancake and the patatas bravas.

I went with a friend I haven't seen for years, and my husband. We were there on a Friday night. Joe Cleveland was behind the bar, Michael Chiarello was in the kitchen and roaming the floor. Joe and his bar staff really provided wonderful service and I would go back in a heartbeat. I'm sure the restaurant proper is great, but if Joe was behind the bar (and probably even if he wasn't), I'd still choose to sit in the bar. \n\nThe Drinks\nI started the night not drinking... so I had a \"J&T\" - juniper and tonic. It's amazing. The best non-alcoholic cocktails I've ever had. Things moved on from there and we ended up trying quite a few of the alcoholic cocktails. Not surprisingly I can't remember their names nearly as well, but they were inventive and fresh without being pretentious or silly, and were a joy to experience. \n\nThe Food\nWe weren't that hungry so ordered only tasting bites, though you can order from the full menu at the bar during meal service times. My only gripe was that the small skewers that cost $2.50 each, are really small. Like, tiny. Truly it's a half a bite of food. Other than that, the food that we did have was great (Patatas Bravas and beet salad). The Patatas Bravas were amazing. Smokey and crisp. \n\nService\nTruly wonderful. Even though we were sitting at the bar on a Friday night, and not spending a particularly huge amount of cash, we were never once rushed out, or made to feel like perhaps we should move on. Service was unobtrusive when we were obviously engaged in conversation, and chatty when we weren't. We actually had to ask for our bill at the end of the night, and they let us sit there and chat and catch up for as long as we wanted.

First of all, I called when it opened for lunch exactly a month before the day I wanted to dine, but was told it was only possible for me to make a reservation at 5:00 PM or much later in the evening, since most tables stay occupied between 6:00 and 8:00 PM...  Okay, 5:00 PM was fine with me.  Then it seemed like he completely butchered my phone number, name, and number of guests.  (It really bothered me, so I called the next day to reconfirm and to make sure everything was correct, which it wasn't; thankfully, the woman who answered this time was MUCH more helpful.  After she finally figured out which reservation was actually mine...)  Unfortunately, this experience made me apprehensive.\n\nFortunately, when we arrived at the pier, we were quickly taken to our table, which was right next to the kitchen.  For the meal we tried:\n\n- Pintxos: The quail egg was my favorite; I probably could have sat there the entire night just eating those.  The combinations were definitely spot on.\n- Patatas bravas: Such a simple dish, yet SOO DELICIOUS!  The garlic aioli that came with it was UHHHMAZING.\n- Gambas al negro: I thought they were perfectly cooked and super juicy.  My girlfriends let me have all the shrimp heads, so that was a bonus for me!\n- Monterey calamari: Pretty good, but I'm a huge fan of squid and felt like I've had better.\n- Octopus: SO UNEXPECTEDLY TENDER!  We loved it, the flavoring was on point too.\n- Duck and pork meatballs: We all thought it was interesting...; definitely did not expect it to be sweet, so I guess that threw us off.  Probably wouldn't order it again.\n- Paella: SOOO, I had expectations for the paella, and it did not reach my expectations.  There was nothing outstanding about it.  We shared 1 order of the paella between 5 people and that was enough.\n- Churros: DELISH. The raspberry dusting was a great combination.\n\nOur waitress also was very informative and was accommodating in adjusting each dish so that each of us had at least one serving of everything.  We really wanted to try to uni open-faced sandwich, but was told they weren't able to acquire any uni for that day.  The drinks were also great; definitely stand out and interesting.\n\nBUT THE SERVICE. The service started off really well.  Our waitress was attentive, but a quarter through our meal, she stopped serving us without explanation even though she was still serving other tables, and we got another server, who checked in very little.  It seems once we placed our orders they were just waiting for us to finish.  For the price of the meal, the service was definitely not on par and not what I expected.\n\nIn conclusion, it was definitely a must on my list of restaurants to try in San Francisco.  Not a fan of the price tag of each plate for the amount of food you are getting and the service, but the dishes were delicious and I could tell each component of each dish was well thought out.

The croquetas, jam\u00f3n serrano, and chorizo were pretty spot-on, but most other fare here is more Spanish-inspired, rather than sticking purely to authentic replication. \n\nA little breakdown of the delectable goodies:\n\n+ The Sunny-side up Huevo -- shrimp, crispy potato, chorizo sauce (yes, that's right, CHORIZO SAUCE) - One of the best dishes here, that combines a whole lot of different flavors and textures in one. Apparently, the chef's son-in-law is from Barcelona, and this dish was inspired by the flavors of a dish he had while visiting BCN. \n\n+ Pulpo a la parilla - Octopus grilled to perfection, a must-try.\n\n+ Croquetas de pollo - Delicious, crispy breaded perfection on the outside, deliciously melt-in-your-mouth english peas and chicken on the inside.\n\n+ Pintxos - Huevos de Codorniz (Quail Egg), Manchego - These were actually my least favorite here. Pintxos in Spain are traditionally even larger than tapas, but these \"pintxos\" were just a piece of cheese on a toothpick, and a quail egg on a toothpick, more or less. Not quite creative, nor really what pintxos are meant to be, which are generally more creative combinations. The toothpick is usually used to hold together all the food;).\n\nOverall, this is a great place for a fancy night out for Spanish-inspired fare. Perfect date spot, or just a date with some palette-pleasing entrees.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-10-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Croquetas de Pollo which is Chicharron crusted chicken and English Pea Croquetas with cured citrus (tangelo).

"], "author": "Jay G.", "review": "After hearing how great this place was, we finally decided to check it out for a birthday last Friday night (I'm behind on my reviews!).  Upon arriving the place was jammed but we did get seating within 10 minutes of our arrival which was great.  The bar area was packed so we just waited to get a drink at our table.\n\nWe were promptly greeted for water and then our server arrived asking us for drinks. She was fantastic, friendly, and funny with a great sense of humor.  So, after looking at the menu, it was time to dig into the ordering.\n\nSeveral at the table decided to share a set of dishes and three others (including me) decided to order our own set to share.\n\nDISHES:\n\nEl Gran Plat Cap which is the chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses served with homemade membrillo, Marcona almond, extra virgin olive oil torta, pan de crista and tomaquet.  The plate came with a generous amount of cheeses (3 types) and 3 different means including some salumi and sausage which was slightly spicy with great lingering flavor.  Put some of the goat cheese or blue cheese on a piece of that spicy sausage and your mouth would water in excitement. Good for 3-4 to share but only a few bites of each.  If you love this and have 5-6 people I would order two of these.\n\nCroquetas de Pollo which is Chicharron crusted chicken and English Pea Croquetas with cured citrus (tangelo).  This was a great dish with that crisp Chicarron outer crispy exterior which when eaten breaks into that soft and hot center with the chicken and English pea filling.  Came 6 to the order so this could be shared by at least 3-4 people.\n\nThe most unique dish of the evening was the \"Sunny Side-Up\" huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts, Chile de Arbol, and chorizo dressing. This was WOW in your mouth.  Everything was mixed together (see my video) by the server and then turned over for consumption...very fast consumption I may add.  This is a do not miss dish!\n\nGambas Negras was the next dish which was ordered by the other group at the table. This was olive oil poached head on gulf prawns with black garlic and chile sauce. This was outstanding as I did taste this as well.  Very rich in flavor and not too heavy on the garlic but just enough to push the flavor through the entire shrimp.\n\nAlbondiga a la Feria was next up which were the duck and pork meatballs. DUCK? PORK? MEATBALL?  YEEESSSSSS!!!!!!  This was an interesting meat ball. Not very firm yet very flavorful. Pick this one up with your finger or slide your fork under each because sticking it will lead to them being broken.  A good dish but it wasn't my favorite, but worth a try for sure.\n\nFAVORITE DISH:\n\nPulpo a la Parrilla. This was wood grilled Mediterranean Octopus, with fresh fingerling potoatos and Pimenton Olive Oil.  I get octopus whenever I can especially when I can get a big fat tentacle with a little charring going on. This is exactly what we got.  You could cut this with a fork barely pressing down it was so tender.  The flavor here with the wood smoke impregnated throughout ever piece of the octopus was fantastic. This was definitely my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nTo finish for the evening, we decided to get an order of the Churro's with drinking Mexican Chocolate.  To the guy who sat next to me with his girlfriend (if he reads this), thanks again for sharing those Churro's.  He insisted we take the two they weren't going to eat and so we tried them.  After trying them we had to order a full order for the table. Dipping that Churro into the Mexican chocolate was heavenly but picking up the chocolate and drinking it to the finish was an awesome way to finish off with an espresso.  Talk about caffeine buzz!\n\nBecause of the incredible service, acknowledged the birthday gal, great sense of humor and keeping me laughing, I'm going with:\n\n5 stars", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-10-21"}, {"excerpts": ["For our tapas, we ordered the following:\n- Croquetas de Pollo ($9) - crunchy on the outside, cheesy, melty, packed with chicken flavor deliciousness on the inside.

Be ready to splurge though! I have never been to Coqueta before but I have seen how beautiful their drinks are here, so I took the opportunity to come here for lunch and we were so glad we came! \n\nThe first impression I had when I walked into this place was it gets rather stuffy on a warm day. The cheeses and cured meats didn't act as a air freshener either, so I was first quite surprised but later adjusted to the smell. We opted to set at the bar to admire their open kitchen. My friend and I settled on ordering a few tapas along with drinks for lunch. Our waitress was a delight and she recommended that for a party of two, it's best to order 4 - 5 tapas to be full for lunch. \n\nWe ordered their famous Gin & Tonics. I got their Barca Gintonic and my friend got their Galleon (both $13) to start. Their drinks are absolutely beautiful with floral pieces floating and the drinks were strong. I liked how our waitress only poured half of the tonic water into the gin to make it strong! The Barca Gintonic was citrusy, refreshing, and delicious. My friend also enjoyed her Galleon but did say it does not taste as strong as the Barca. \n\nFor our tapas, we ordered the following:\n- Croquetas de Pollo ($9) - crunchy on the outside, cheesy, melty, packed with chicken flavor deliciousness on the inside. They paired very well with the refreshing gintonics. \n- Sunny side-up Huevo ($13) - a little bit too oily and salty for our taste but it was still good. Our waiter first served it prior to mixing then proceeded to mix it in front of us at the table.\n- Pulpo de Parilla ($14) - Yum! the octopus was super tender and soft. It was also very fresh since the octopus had a strong taste of the ocean. haha.\n- Albondigas a la Feria ($14) - the meatballs were super flavorful and tender. It was served with some caramelized onions for that salty and sweet flavor that was wonderful.\n- Salmon Alhumado ($8) - Absolutely DELICIOUS! Winner of the day!! Sad that it was $4 for each bite. The smoked salmon was at excellent quality and the truffle honey was mind blowing. The flavor contrast from the salty smoked salmon and the truffle honey paired super well together and the truffle enhanced all of the flavors and blended them together. It was like a flavor explosion in the mouth. Encore!!!\n\nWe were stuffed at the end of the meal and were happy to say the dishes were all very good! Our bill came to be $125 plus tax for two, which definitely is not your normal daily lunch!

Food was really great.  And the service was amazing!--the place was full but every waitress and server was so polite and happy, and even encouraged me to take more photos! (and I soooo did!  it was so easy to make everything look great--check my pics out!)\n\n1. Sangria (White Win, Roasted Apples, Spices, House Recipe) 750ml Porron $36:  Despite the involved craft, the taste was not as complex as I was hoping.  It was of course good tasting as expected, but probably not as amazing as the description.  5/10.\n\n2. Salmon Ahumado $8:  Ha ha, so they called this an \"open face sandwich\" but seriously, just call it an hors d oeuvre!  Anyway, these will probably be some of the best smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres you've ever seen.  The honey makes it taste a lot more special.  7/10.\n\n3. Huevos Nacional $7:  Like many of the others, this is a masterfully re-envisioned version of a traditional dish.  Never had any deviled eggs like this!  Stuffed with spring peas and smoked pimenton alioli they say.  Very unique.  8/10.\n\n4. Patatas Bravas $8:  Hmmm, very interesting one here.  I would say this would kinda be like an ultra fancy version of tater tots, you know, if you used purple potatoes, smoked them, and made up a fancy dip.  You do taste the special taste of the fresh and fancy potatoes, but personally to me I'd go for a bit more kick.  Sauce is very slightly hot, but barely--could use a bit more heat.  The meat looks beautiful though!  7/10.\n\n5. Croquetas de Pollo $9:  Mmmmmm.... kinda reminds me of similar creations from Porto's in Glendale, but for 2x the price, ha ha.  Probably would fall in the \"comfort food\" category.  Tastes yummy though!  7/10.\n\n6. Albondigas a la Feria $14:  The most unique and complex meatballs I've ever had.  The meat is very soft and juicy on the inside, and though does resemble an Italian meatball, somehow manages to taste and feel totally different!  The outside flavor and sauce is quite strong and distinct.  I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.  Flavor was great though, but unlike the others maybe somewhat traditional.  The drinking chocolate was good but could use more spice.  The sour powder was badass though--great kick.  5/10.\n\nWorks of art to eat.  Wonderful service.

They deserve at least that much, and hopefully you catch them on a good night. The good news is, there's a lot of options to choose from and something is bound to strike your fancy.\n\n\"It must have been a bad night.\" \"Maybe they were short staffed tonight.\" \"Well ,we did eat late, so that must have something to do with it.\" \"Chiarello must not come around much.\" I find myself looking for reasons to give Coqueta a higher rating, but for now, I don't have one.\n\nNeed more info? Read on.\n\n----\n\n\nHere's what I took from this experience:\n\nThe Space and Staff.\nThere is an air of Chiarello's aesthetic all over the place; You'll recognize the Napa Style (his retail endeavor) merchandise all over the place. Animal hides on the walls. Hammered copper tumblers. Rustic wood tables. There is nothing unapproachable or intimidating about it.\n\nThe host and waitress were very sweet, but the waitress forgot an order and didn't check on us as frequently as we'd hoped so we could place another order before the kitchen closed. Though she asked just before this time came, we felt pressured not to order when she finally asked because the kitchen closed in one minute. We would have ordered more otherwise.\n\nThe Pricing.\nReasonable and expected. Some items were insanely overpriced, some were right on target. I'm not afraid to pay good money for a tiny, one-bite wonder, but not for something lackluster and ordinary. We ordered 2 alcoholic drinks, 4 skewers, 1 cold tapas plate, 1 hot plate, 1 vegetable plate, and 2 dessert items for about $100 with tip.\n\n---\n\nThe Food.\nIt's hard to say anything other than \"confused\" here. There are some traditional combinations as well as some unusual pairings, but they didn't always deliver.\n\nThe Highs\n\nCroquetas de Pollo\nThese were heavenly, and as many reviewers said, like chicken pot pie in a bite.\nVery creamy interior, crispy exterior. The cured oranges on the side were a nice palette cleanser and were nice combined when combined with the Croquetas as well, but seem sort of haphazard on the side of the plate.\n\nChurros\nI'm happy that this was the last thing I had before leaving. The order came with four small-sized churros, served with a small cup of drinking chocolate and crushed mixed berry powder. This powder, while seeming to be nothing more than a garnish, really makes the dish. The acidity from the berries cuts right through the heavy body of the chocolate, and compliments the cinnamon and sugar on the churro. Spot on in flavor, but could have been warmer. They didn't seem fresh.\n\nManchego Cheesecake Pops\nA smart combination and delicious. As a sheepsmilk cheese, Manchego has a small amount of tang that is reminiscent of cream cheese -- I think that's why these work and where the sweet and savory happily come together. The pops are served on a stick and with small bits of caramel corn on the platter to bring back the sweet side of things. Probably the highlight of the night.\n\n----\nThe (Really Low) Lows--\n\nPintxos - Bite Size Skewers\nThese are a joke. We had 4 of the 5 options available, there were all forgettable and left me saying, \"$2.50 for that?\" It wasn't an issue of size by any means, but of flavor. Maybe our skewers had been sitting around for a while, and they certainly tasted that way. None of the flavors really stood out for how simple the ingredients were. I wouldn't order any of these again.\n\nSeta de Ajillo\nThis was a tragedy. This should have been a simple, wonderful dish and was by far the biggest disappointment. I absolutely love mushrooms, and had to choke this down because of how insanely over seasoned and oily they was. Was it supposed to be like this? I should have sent it back.\n\n----\n\nThe experience was pleasant overall, but there is a lot of room for improvement. What I was served wasn't a true reflection of what Chef Chiarello is capable of, and it's an issue of execution. I didn't love anything and the lows really put a damper on the entire meal.  I'm under the impression that this is a side project doesn't get much of the chef's attention. \n\nWith some attentiveness and focus to the vision of Coqueta, I think this would have been a much better experience.

We've all been there).\n\nThey serve a a modern interpretation of traditional Spanish tapas with a twist of northern California flavors. The menu features cured meats & iberian cheeses; cold tapas; open-face sandwiches; a dozen hot tapas; and family-style shared plates.\n\nPretty much, everything I ordered was a winner and there wasn't anything I didn't enjoy. The only thing I regret is not having room for more food (insert: crying emoji).\n\n+ Croquetas de Pollo ($9)\n\nOkay. Hands down... these are my favorite things here. It comes with three chichar\u00f3n-crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured cara-cara oranges. Once you bite through the crispy outer layer, you get a creamy consistency with tender chucks of chicken inside.\n\n+Salmon Ahumado ($8). Omg... that truffle honey... I die.\n\nThis was a nice little palate opener and my 2nd favorite thing here (I'm a huge fan of lox bagels). The combination of the sweet honey + the saltiness of the salmon + the crunch of the crispy bread made it a perfect bite.\n\n+Albondigas a la Feria ($14)\n\nSo bomb. These are grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots.  The meatballs were juicy and tender with a deep brown sear on the exterior.\n\n+Paella: The classic ($45/ serves 2-3)\n\nI can't even right now... (currently: writing this blog post while starving)\n\nHonestly, it's one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThis version is made with bomba rice that nicely soaks up all the flavors of the jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, topped with gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, and broccolini.\n\nWhile all that^ was already bomb, it wasn't until I tasted the lemon aioli till I was REALLY blown away.\n\nSo to sum it all up:\n\nCoqueta is perfect for a nice brunch or dinner date (especially since it's located at Pier 5 along the embarcadero). I'd recommend coming here with friends so you can share everything and order more food. The paella is a MUST (you could prob split that between 4 people) and order more tapas to share. And since it takes about 30-40min to make, place your order right when you sit down!\n\nVisit the blog for pics: http://cyneats.com/", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Croquetas de Pollo - my favorite dish.

Being huge fans of Bottega (where we ate the night before), we had high expectations for Coqueta, but have to say food was just okay for the money.  Being right on the water the space has a great feel and the staff in general was great, but from the second you walk in you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for everything (which is the opposite of Bottega).  We went expecting to drop a bomb on food as that was kind of the point of this splurge trip to San Francisco, so didn't mind the high menu prices, but rather the way things were forced on you.  For instance, as soon as you sit down they bring you a tray with about 2 dozen \"bite sized skewers\" (Pintxos) which they present as an amuse-bouche (which is almost expected at nicer restaurants these days); however, once you take one, waitress explains they are $2.50 each (really not worth it for food that has just been sitting out and visited every table in restaurant...ick....and yes, I have spent time in Spain, where this is done at bars, but this just feels wrong). \nMoving on, we each ordered about 2 Tapas plates (there were 4 of us) and Paella....we were going to add on more but waitress said it would be plenty of food.  Since on the topic of pricing, I have to jump forward to our bill before covering food flavor.  When we got our bill we were surprised to to see that we had been charged extra for every single dish...presumably to make it split-able for 4 people....the problem is that the waitress made no mention of this and we did not tell her we wanted to split the dishes (in fact some of the dishes were for certain people as other people at table had food issues and could not split).  It would have been totally been fine if she mentioned this, but instead just decided to add this to our bill which just seemed slimy.\nOkay, so onto the food.\nCroquetas De Pollo:  Tasty fried croquettes....hard to screw up something like this so obviously good.\nGambas al Negor:  Very good and has a nice kick to it with the pepper.\nTotillita de Camaron: Everyone felt this was okay but not great.\nPulpo a la Parilla:  The grilled octopus was highlight of entire meal and wish I just ordered several plates of it.  It was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth.\nAlbondigas a la Feria: The duck meatballs just felt kind felt kind of flat.  Maybe it was that the cherry sauce was too weak....raspberry would make it a million times better.\nPatatas Xips e Salsa Apertivo: The chips are great, but $7 for 6 small potato chips is just ridiculous (this should be something they just include with the meal).\nHuevos Nacional: Great presentation and overall taste, but the bonito essentially tastes like chicken of the sea.\nEsparrago Trigeros con Remesco: excellent flavor and taste.\nEnsalada de Remolacha:  good, but ridiculously small serving size.\nPaella: Says it serves 2-3, but really the seafood is about enough for 1.5, and the rice is for 3.  It was okay, but dry and really not any better than any standard corner Spanish restaurant (which we have a lot of in NYC).\n\nBy the way, the Sangria is really nice and light and refreshing.\n\nIn summary, it is good and has a great atmosphere, but we weren't blown away and while we expected to spend a lot, felt deceived by how hidden costs were added to the bill.\n\nFinally, I have to say that  I am impressed with how present Michael Chiarello is at his restaurants.

We had heard good things about it and she had never had Spanish food so I thought it would be a god idea to go. I do NOT regret it\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is kinda hard to describe its a sort of like a small industrial hanger meets cowboy/Spanish ranch. I know that sounds silly but its the best I can do... Despite having the kitchen in the same room the place was fairly quiet even when it was packed. I just felt so cool eating at this place. Also its comfy and in a BEAUTIFUL location.\n\nStaff:\nThe staff was professional but incredibly laid back. They were so comfortable with each other and making little jokes left and right. My only complaint was that there were lots of staff members which just seemed excessive to me, considering they tended to leave us alone for the most part.\n\nFood:\n-We got: Pan con tomate (with ham), an organic tomato salad (special), patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, the \"Bakini\" (basically an eggplant sandwich), Chesecake, Chocolate fantasia and the pan con chocolate. \n\nNOTE this was about $75 before the tip if youre hungry id expect to pay about 30 to 40 a person.\n\nSo we ordered what seems like a lot of food but the portions here are small! I feel dumb saying this but, I do not recommend coming here if you're starving.\nThe food was all delicious but  our favorites were: the chicken croquettes, the special salad and the potatoes (honorable mention to the bread though, that was great too). My only complaint was with the \"bikini\"; although it was still a yummy bite, I thought the blue cheese was just too overpowering. Even the sweet sauce it comes with had to take a back seat to the cheese flavor, and you can forget about tasting anything else they say is in the sandwich. Other than that the dinner courses were top-notch and from what I remember of Spanish food very authentic, though the chef does have his interpretation of things.\nAs for dessert we both enjoyed it but I felt it was of SLIGHTLY lesser quality than the main courses. That being said, if youre coming here I recommend getting at least the Curros and chocolate dish, if you like cheesy cheesecake then youll like theirs. As for the pan con chocolate I wouldnt really recommend it, the ice cream is bland and the chocolate cake is not chocolaty... in fact I found it salty if anything.\n\nConclusions:\nThough I may have sounded harsh at times we both loved eating here and once I save up enough money I would be happy to go back again! Definitely the best and most authentic Spanish food in the bay, probably even in all northern California. This is really as good as it gets.\nOne last thing.

I was fortunate enough to catch an early BART train, but it meant I was a 1/2 hour early for the reservation. I was expecting to cool my heels in a very crowded bar. Instead, they seated me right away. As soon as I was situated, my server brought me water and asked if I wanted a drink while I waited. I have looked over the menu on line and was delighted to see it was current. I ordered the Sutter Smash which had caught my eye. Knowing I was alone for the moment, my server kept checking in with me. One of the things she asked was if there were any food restriction or allergies. I told here I didn't have any but that my friend was vegetarian. She promised to mark up a menu for her that highlighted t dishes that were already vegetarian or could easily be made so. When she delivered my cocktail, my waitress asked if I wanted to order a meat dish before my dinner companion arrived. Normally, I would wait, but sometimes I feel guilty eating meat with my veggies friends. The server recommended the chicken croquettes, which would be quick and (of course) delicious. I did, and they were. They were three, two bite bits of cheesy, fried,  chicken deliciousness that were served with slices of orange and slivers of pepper. Yum! Shortly after polishing them off my dish was whisked away and my friend arrived. Just based on that part of my experience, I would say that the service is worth 5 stars. The excellent service continued though out the dinner. Water was poured, new dishes were brought out (great pacing) and empty dishes were whisked away to make room.  Everything we tried (please check out the photos) was delicious. My only real disappointment was the asparagus dish (not sure of the official name).  The Romesco sauce and Manchego that were part of the dish were delicious. The micro greens and the vegetable itself were just OK. The Bikini (brioche a la plancha with ca\u00f1a de cabra, roasted eggplant and Quince Jalea) and Pan con tomate were both particularly good, I think in part because the bread was so wonderful. The dessert was good, but not amazing. I think that and the asparagus are why I can't give 5 stars. If I could I would lean to 4.25 or 4.5. I really wish I had tried the Gambas Negras and Setas al ajillo (sherry laced mushrooms). Both of those are tapas staples for me, but it would have been way too much food. Maybe next time. I also want to try the paella. I typically either go straight for that or have tapas, not both.

After bringing some friends to the Ferry Building to check stuff out we took out our handy Yelp machines and brought up this place.  So happy to have came--everything was amazingly beautiful.  Food was really great.  And the service was amazing!--the place was full but every waitress and server was so polite and happy, and even encouraged me to take more photos! (and I soooo did!  it was so easy to make everything look great--check my pics out!)\n\n1. Sangria (White Win, Roasted Apples, Spices, House Recipe) 750ml Porron $36:  Despite the involved craft, the taste was not as complex as I was hoping.  It was of course good tasting as expected, but probably not as amazing as the description.  5/10.\n\n2. Salmon Ahumado $8:  Ha ha, so they called this an \"open face sandwich\" but seriously, just call it an hors d oeuvre!  Anyway, these will probably be some of the best smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres you've ever seen.  The honey makes it taste a lot more special.  7/10.\n\n3. Huevos Nacional $7:  Like many of the others, this is a masterfully re-envisioned version of a traditional dish.  Never had any deviled eggs like this!  Stuffed with spring peas and smoked pimenton alioli they say.  Very unique.  8/10.\n\n4. Patatas Bravas $8:  Hmmm, very interesting one here.  I would say this would kinda be like an ultra fancy version of tater tots, you know, if you used purple potatoes, smoked them, and made up a fancy dip.  You do taste the special taste of the fresh and fancy potatoes, but personally to me I'd go for a bit more kick.  Sauce is very slightly hot, but barely--could use a bit more heat.  The meat looks beautiful though!  7/10.\n\n5. Croquetas de Pollo $9:  Mmmmmm.... kinda reminds me of similar creations from Porto's in Glendale, but for 2x the price, ha ha.  Probably would fall in the \"comfort food\" category.  Tastes yummy though!  7/10.\n\n6. Albondigas a la Feria $14:  The most unique and complex meatballs I've ever had.  The meat is very soft and juicy on the inside, and though does resemble an Italian meatball, somehow manages to taste and feel totally different!  The outside flavor and sauce is quite strong and distinct.  I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.  Flavor was great though, but unlike the others maybe somewhat traditional.  The drinking chocolate was good but could use more spice.  The sour powder was badass though--great kick.  5/10.\n\nWorks of art to eat.  Wonderful service.

I had heard good things from Coqueta, and it had 4 stars, but to be honest, I have had better spanish food in the worst tourist traps in Spain than here.\n\nChef Dominick Maietta clearly has no idea about spanish cuisine, and as a spaniard I found some of the food in this place culturally offensive.\n\nI should have known better when I saw what they consider \"paella\". The moment you see chorizo as a paella ingredient you know that you are not in the right place, but in one of those that thinks that yellow rice with multiple meats and seafoods is paella. However, I thought that if I avoided the paella and just order tapas it would be ok. I was mistaken.\n\nThe pintxos are what I would call a scam. If chef Dominick Maietta has never tried them at least he could google them, and he would see that they are served over bread. $2.5 for a boiled quail egg and a piece of pepper without bread, is not just a scam, is simply disgusting. If he had ever visited a restaurant in Spain he would also know that the moment you sit down, there should be bread on the table.\n\nThe \"house cured\" serrano ham gives bad name to what serrano ham should be. It was really bland, with not enough taste and the texture was too soft. By the way, you do not put pepper on serrano ham.\n\nOne of the most surprising failures in the menu was the Pan con tomate. This is a traditional snack that even as a little children I could prepare by myself. You take a piece of bread, toast it, you rub half a tomato into it, add olive oil and salt, and you got it. Simple, cheap and delicious!... apparently even that is too complicated for the chef. His concept of pan con tomate is bringing a piece of toasted bread and a little bowl of what looks like a can tomato sauce.\n\nThe octopus was ok, slightly overcooked, and way too small for a $14 tapa, but given the previous failures I was happy to have something decent.\n\nThe bikini was good, again a bit too small, but tasty and warm.

It was one of my favorites. Simple and slightly lemony.\n\nGulf Prawns with black garlic and chili sauce - MUST ORDER if you're a shrimp freak like me. The head-on prawns were soft and super flavorful because of the sauce, which you can dip the accompanying 3 slices of toasted bread into. 3 prawns come in each order. \n\nSunny Side up Huevo w/ Shrimp - by far the most unusual dish but really delicious. A small platter of shrimp, sunny side up fried egg, and slivers of shoe string potatoes (?) arrives at your table. The waitress then promptly mixes it all together so that the egg yolk blends into the dish, like a casserole.

We had heard good things about it and she had never had Spanish food so I thought it would be a god idea to go. I do NOT regret it\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is kinda hard to describe its a sort of like a small industrial hanger meets cowboy/Spanish ranch. I know that sounds silly but its the best I can do... Despite having the kitchen in the same room the place was fairly quiet even when it was packed. I just felt so cool eating at this place. Also its comfy and in a BEAUTIFUL location.\n\nStaff:\nThe staff was professional but incredibly laid back. They were so comfortable with each other and making little jokes left and right. My only complaint was that there were lots of staff members which just seemed excessive to me, considering they tended to leave us alone for the most part.\n\nFood:\n-We got: Pan con tomate (with ham), an organic tomato salad (special), patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, the \"Bakini\" (basically an eggplant sandwich), Chesecake, Chocolate fantasia and the pan con chocolate. \n\nNOTE this was about $75 before the tip if youre hungry id expect to pay about 30 to 40 a person.\n\nSo we ordered what seems like a lot of food but the portions here are small! I feel dumb saying this but, I do not recommend coming here if you're starving.\nThe food was all delicious but  our favorites were: the chicken croquettes, the special salad and the potatoes (honorable mention to the bread though, that was great too). My only complaint was with the \"bikini\"; although it was still a yummy bite, I thought the blue cheese was just too overpowering. Even the sweet sauce it comes with had to take a back seat to the cheese flavor, and you can forget about tasting anything else they say is in the sandwich. Other than that the dinner courses were top-notch and from what I remember of Spanish food very authentic, though the chef does have his interpretation of things.\nAs for dessert we both enjoyed it but I felt it was of SLIGHTLY lesser quality than the main courses.

As for the pan con chocolate I wouldnt really recommend it, the ice cream is bland and the chocolate cake is not chocolaty... in fact I found it salty if anything.\n\nConclusions:\nThough I may have sounded harsh at times we both loved eating here and once I save up enough money I would be happy to go back again! Definitely the best and most authentic Spanish food in the bay, probably even in all northern California. This is really as good as it gets.\nOne last thing.

The caviar was a nice touch to draw in all flavors along with the truffle!\n- Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs - this was put together so beautifully. Not my favorite dish, because it had a different taste to it that was soured with a pickled slice of potato underneath. But if you're a deviled egg lover - Try it!\n- Patatas Bravas: crispy potatoes on the outside and soft on the inside!

The past two times I've gone have been extremely lackluster, so I'm beginning to think that maybe I'm doing it wrong?\n\nYet another company lunch from my loving and generous boss. Well, in fact, this was the third time she's treated us to Coqueta since my first review back in September. And I will also say that I'm not the only one from my team who thought things were not up to par, or at least not as good at the first time we went as a group. Something has definitely changed in the kitchen, and it's showing. \n\nBack to the matter at hand: I walked down to the restaurant around 1:30PM and my party was sitting at the middle long table in the main dining room. Our waitress was helpful and attentive, wishing me a happy birthday since my boss had told everyone of my upcoming day of birth. \n\nI had the Engine Co. #5 for my cocktail which was tart and strong, just how I like it. \n\nWe ordered three of the *El Gran Plat Cap* (assorted meats / nuts / cheeses) - this is always a good choice as there's a lot of variety and it's cured meats and great cheeses, you can't eff this up\n\n\n~Some of our Tapas~\n \n*Pimientos de Padron* - a favorite and also difficult to eff up, roasted peppers with Jamon Serrano, sherry vinegar, and coarse sea salt\n\n*Albondigas a la Feria* - meh, these duck / pork meatballs were super oniony, with crunchy onions inside and more caramelized on top. Also I got a tendon kind of texture that ruined the meatball for me, I took one bite and didn't have any more\n\n*Patatas Bravas* - ugh, I was so disappointed in the little fried potatoes both last time and this time getting them. In September they were heavenly: light and crispy. But each time since then, they've been oily and dense\n\n*Croquettes de Pollo* - another let down, and sadly so, as they were a favorite in the past. The filling of chicken and peas had a curdled texture and an overly oniony after taste and was not hot inside the breaded casings\n\n*Salmon Ahumado* - little open-faced salmon sandwiches. Sooo fishy. And way too cheesy. The Queso Fresca was piled high and the salmon was slimy and gooey with truffle honey. The bread it was served on reminded me of an old toasted Bagel Bite and was a harsh pairing for the softer ingredients matched with it\n\nWe had other Tapas too, but they were nothing to say much about, good or bad.\n\n~Our Entr\u00e9es~\n\n*Paella* - I was very excited to try this as it's a classic dish, and supposedly one of the star plates at Coqueta. Unfortunately it was not as good as it could have been, and I can honestly say that my friend's mother who has little cooking experience makes a better paella\n\n*Pluma* - I thought this was a tender and delicious pork shoulder cut, I have no complaints about it\n\nMost of our desserts were fine, my favorite is the mini churro with dipping chocolate and berry powder. I had a bite of the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream and was not enthused by the bitter, moldy taste. \n\nI hope we go again so Coqueta can get out of this slump and show us all that same great food we experienced just a few months ago.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-06-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Huevos Nacional (deviled eggs)\nPimientos de Padron (roasted peppers topped with jamon)\n"], "author": "April B.", "review": "The hubby and I got late night reservations to Coqueta on a Sunday night.

If I were to be really picky, the only thing that would probably bother me is the size of the pintxos; they were much smaller than we were expecting for $2.50 each.

It's a must have when you go there!\n\nThe hubby's highlight were the roasted peppers, they had a lot of flavor especially with the slivers of jamon on top. The octopus was nice and soft and the grilled sausages were also very flavorful; I especially enjoyed the blood sausage. Believe it or not my most favorite thing to eat were the greens, they came in a nice bown and were bitter, yet sweet; they went well with everything.\n\nNow, I'm a big coffee and dessert person but by the end of our meal we were the last ones in the restaurant and I could tell the staff were preparing to close. I got shy and didn't end up ordering dessert even though our server suggested we still could. The reason for the five stars is that she ended up bringing us dessert anyway which were the cheesecake bites! I was so delighted that I got my little dessert at the end of the meal; for free!

But with my recent couple of visits, I realized that what food I had there before barely even scratched the surface.  I got try a bunch of stuff I didn't have, and they were some of the best items on their menu.\n\nOne thing to note is that their bar is pretty cool.  I never actually hung out there before, but when I had dinner there with a few friends, I arrived early to try their famous Bar\u00e7a Gintonic.\n\nBar\u00e7a Gintonic -- http://bit.ly/1KzsPZL\nBloom London dry gin, Fever Tree tonic with grapefruit and pine.\nA very fragrant, refreshing cocktail that's visually appealing.  Okay it looks like a fish bowl, but still looks awesome.  I'd surely order this again.\n\nIt's also good to know that when you're at the bar, you can also order anything on the menu.  So you can enjoy a few small plates and pair it with some wine or a fancy cocktail.  I still think my favorite drink there is their Porron Kalimotxo that I had before.\n\nWhen it came to dinner time, even though I had been there before, we pretty let our waiter decide what to get on their menu for the most part.  And he hit it out of the park with all his selections.  Here are some of my favorite highlights from our dinner:\n\nGambas al Negro -- http://bit.ly/1FQNqHP\nOlive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce.\nNicely cooked prawns and the garlic flavor was pretty strong.\n\nSalmon Ahumado -- http://bit.ly/1Jlagdh\nSmoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey\nThese were like little fancy lox bagels.  The truffle honey really made them super rich and delicious.  I actually liked these better than their Mar y Montana, but they're not that far off.\n\nPluma -- http://bit.ly/1GTMAfF\nIberico de Belotta Pork Shoulder Loin with Honey Chili Glaze\nMy favorite item of the night.  I think out of all the things I wanted to try, this was my most anticipated.  The pork was so tender, moist, and flavorful, that it really didn't need the Honey Chili Glaze, but the glaze was a great sweet flavor enhancement when drizzled on.  This is a must order!\n\nPaella -- http://bit.ly/1BEIXnH\nBomba rice, Jamon Serrano-Shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, cauliflower and lemon aioli.\nThis Paella is awesome!  Visually and substantially!  You'd think that even though you're at a fancy restaurant, the portion would be small, but this was a perfectly portioned paella for my group.  It came with huge shrimp and was loaded everything listed above.  Why didn't I order this before???\n\nOverall the dinner was a great experience.  Everyone at the table enjoyed our waiter's personal selections.  When I came back again with another group of friends about a month later for lunch, we pretty much ordered the same things above, plus a few things I had from my past visits like their Duck and Pork Albondigas and Patatas Bravas.  All was good and they didn't miss a beat with any of this things we ordered.\n\nAfter having dinner and lunch here again, it's no wonder why Coqueta is still one of my favorite places to dine in the city.

I was in luck when I got reservation!\n\nWe got there early and was seated in a room that is adjacent to the actual dining area, this area has the bar and a few seats where people sat and drank as well. We ordered a drink to start the night, the Kalimotxo which has Mexican Coke, Red Sangria, and Cinnamon. This drink was full of flavor but resides a bit on the dry side. It is only served in a party pitcher (500 mL). \n\nWe were shown to our seats promptly, matter of fact, 10 minutes before our actual reservation time.  Our server, Lowell was AWESOME from the beginning. He is very knowledgeable of all the amazing food and drinks Coqueta serves. After we looked at the menu and made our choices, he picked and chose the order of our food and he was spot on! \n\nUnfortunately, I really wanted to try the \"Mar y Montana\", but they were sold out of the sea urchin (this gives me the perfect excuse to come back!).\n\nThe patatas bravas (freshly dug, crispy new potatoes, lightly smoked, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli). It was flavorful and the potatoes are perfect bite size pieces. The garlic alioli and salsa help brought out the flavor of the smoked potatoes. There was a great balance of salty and sweet.\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas (served alongside with cured cara-cara orange) (3 pieces). These puppies were like mini pot pies, bursting with richness in flavor! Super creamy and packed with great seasoning. The cured orange was served alongside with the croquetas, but I didn't try them. \n\nGambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on Gulf prawns with black garlic and chili). This was an amazing dish. Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert.

I specifically asked for a table by the window with a weeks reservations in advance and she sits me & my boss at the bar.  We see an open table for two close enough to the window and ask why we can't be seated there.  My boss seeing I was upset said the young lady asked for a table by the window and we see that table is free.  Grumpily the hostess leads us there.  Ok not a good start.\n\nThe restaurant itself was beautiful . Two separate, and very different, rooms provided a nice union -- Bar 5, a glass-enclosed terrace has an outdoor/indoor feel, with window-filled walls featuring views of the San Francisco Bay. The restaurant has an intimate feel with the wooden tables, stone walls, flickering candles with most of the tables  having a view of the kitchen.\n\nWith the glowing reviews that I read from other Yelpers I really wanted to give Coqueta an amazing review,  I can look past the hohum service if the food was good.

After having just eaten at Lolo and Esperpento and loving the tapas there I was ready to get blown away but I did not. \n\nThe Pintxos ~ one of each bite skewer of chorizo, jamon Serrano and boquerones  the bite was so small I would have thought I was serving it to a 5 year old.\n\nTattas Bravas ~ glamorized tater tots w salsa and alioli was as forgettable as my first grade teacher's name. Really can you not have been more creative than tater tots for a Michael Chiarello restaurant?\n\nRoasted Padron Peppers ~ my least favorite, the sherry vinegar drowning out the crisp pepper taste could barely even taste the jamon serrano. I was getting really sad!\n\nSmoked salmon ~ open -faced with queso fresco with truffle honey, a play on bagels and lox but the salmon was overpowered by the honey. Interesting though I liked it. It was ok not spectacular.\n\nWood-grilled octopus ~ the most interesting dish I ate at Coqueta.  Smoky, tender, charry, wonderful. I did not understand the purpose of the potatoes on the plate because they detracted from the octopus flavor and the portion was tiny even for a tapas.\n \nGrilled Iberico Secreto ~ Despite being pork, it tasted like beef, didn't stand out. For $24 I was better off ordering a steak and getting full someplace else.\n\nGambas al negro ~ lacked flavor and spice that gambas usually has, and with a measly three pieces of prawns for $14 I was really getting depressed on how this meal was turning out to be.\n\nI was too embarrassed to show how displeased I was to my boss who was clearly eager to show his appreciation for my work for the company.  Walking back to the office I asked him what he thought of the meal. He said it was ok, he expected it to be pricey for it being at The Embarcadero, but the portions were too small and he has had exactly the same types of dishes in other tapas places that tasted way better than what we ordered and had bigger \"tapas portions.\"   \n\nWell that sums it up.

We shared everything family-style with the following:\n\nChicken and English peas croquetas - these were wonderful and rich. They reminded me of fancy jalapeno poppers.

Everything blended well together. It was very reminiscent of a Spanish-style breakfast. \n\nGrilled beef shortribs - this was my least favorite dish. The ribs were nothing special. They tasted texturally like Korean shortribs, but lacked the flavor. The glaze, pomegranate, and seville orange didn't add anything.\n\nPaella - this was the star entree of dinner.

And tantalized they were...\n\nThe food is simply incredible from start to finish. I highly recommend ordering about 2-3 tapas and 1 main entree per person as the portions are quite meager. I highly recommend the following: \n\n1. Melt in your mouth chicken and english pea croquetas\n2. Bursting with flavor sunny side up egg with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing\n3. Intense gambas al negro with gulf prawns, black garlic & chilli\n4. Tender and juicy pluma pork shoulder loin with honey chilli glaze\n5. Silky smooth arroz cremosa (slowly cooked bomba rice with day boat scallops and summer squash & blossoms)\n6. Drool inducing churro fantasia dessert\n7. Classic flan espanola dessert \n\nBut don't stop with just the food. Please try some of the delicious hand crafted libations from the fabulous mixologists. The cocktails here are simply to die for! Tell the waiter/waitress what you're in the mood for and you'll get the perfect recommendations! Also, don't forget to pair your dessert with a dessert wine - the ports here taste like spiked honey. \n\nAnd of course, the ambiance is classy & trendy and the views are great. \n\nSo if you're lucky enough to snag a reservation, definitely check out Coqueta. You won't regret it! \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-11-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The gambas al negro (prawns in olive oil and garlic sauce with toasted French bread, is okay because you can eat this anywhere.

It feels like it's separated into 2 different rooms both daily small; one it's just sitting area with the kitchen in front of you if you're sitting around the counter area and another seating area, you have a bar. They have a wide range of liquor sand also pretty interesting cocktails. We made a reservation and got there 10 minutes before but still had to wait 20 minutes for a table because they happened to have a huge group that's seated. The service was actually pretty decent. \n\nThere's so many options in tapas whether it's hot or cold. They also have a few selections on cured meats, cheese platters, and the bite size skewers. They do have big plates (family/entree size). We were about to order the bite size skewers but none of them have meat in them so we passed on that. We wanted to try a lot of items on their menu so we didn't order any big/entree plates. \n\nWe ordered the deviled eggs and it's pretty creamy, but I think they can do a little better on the toppings. The croquetas de pollo is a MUST try dish! It's deep fried and crispy on the outside but very flavorful and creamy on the inside. They also give you little orange  slices which I guess it's to cleanse your palettes. The patatas bravas is a little different. It's mini fried potato balls that has a smokey taste, but I do love the dipping sauce and it does make a difference in terms of taste. The gambas al negro (prawns in olive oil and garlic sauce with toasted French bread, is okay because you can eat this anywhere. The sunny side up surprisingly tasted a little like kimchi fried rice without the kimchi and rice and it's actually pretty good. It also comes with crispy thinly sliced potatoes which reminds me of very fresh hash browns. Our last tapas was the duck and pork meatballs. It's a little on the sweeter side, wish it's more savory.\n\nOf course we ordered desserts too. We ordered the flan and the bite size cheesecake. The flan was perfect in texture and taste, not too sweet, and it has fresh blackberries with it so it's more healthy. On the other hand, the bite size cheesecake was way too sweet and heavy. It also comes with caramel popcorn and it's also pretty sweet. \n\nThis restaurant is good with their drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) and savory dishes.

(NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE BARTENDER AND MANAGER)\n\nI made reservations for Saturday, Oct 11 for my wife's 40th Birthday.  We arrived about 30 minutes early to have some drinks and quickly made our way to the bar.  I had read about the \"Championship Policy\" and wanted to try it while my wife had a \"Galleon.\"  \n\nWhen I received my drink it seemed like there was BARELY 2 oz in the glass which was disappointing considering it was $13.  I immediately questioned why people made good reviews about it.  My wife's drink was a watered down gin and tonic at best.\n\nWe were sat a bit early at our table next to three gals who were celebrating a birthday as well.  They immediately struck up conversation with us and wanted to show us their \"glistening\" drink.  I asked what it was and it turns out it was also a \"Championship Policy.\"  I was confused as to why they had triple the pour and as I looked a table to my left I noticed another drink similar to theirs.  The girls said my drink was weak because I didn't show up in a short skirt, maybe they knew something I didn't...  \n\nI called our server over and asked why such a drastic difference in how the drink was made.  I got a \"beat-around-the-bush\" answer and she returned later with a drink similar to the others I had seen.  I also ordered a \"Sun Never Goes Down\" for my wife which once again seemed short on the pour.  I now regretted the good tip I had left the bartender.  (Taller bald guy)\n\nThe food overall was great.   We both tried each of the bite size skewers - we probably could have ate a platter of them.  The \"Sunny Side Up Huevo\" was good enough to punch someone in the face or fight over, we should have ordered two.  We also shared the albondigas and gambas al negro which were very good as well.

I explained that I had closed my tab after my first order of drinks and showed her the receipt.  At that point the table next to us was listening in and offering their condolences as our server returned with our adjusted tab with little more than a \"sorry about that.\"  The manager (blonde lady in all black) walked by right after that and I explained what had occurred from our initial drinks to the discrepancy in our tab.

My husband and I received a very warm greeting as soon as we arrived. We sat in the bar area, and we had constant attention from various staff when it came to ordering/refilling of water cups/asking for more drinks/etc. \n\nWhat's also good: the decor. The bar area where we sat had some great seating, and I really appreciated that my bar chair had a back to lean on, as I noticed some people were using stools, which probably would not be as comfortable for long periods of time.  \n\nWhat's not so good: the food, oh no! I wanted this so badly to be yummy. My husband and I spent approx. $194 (w/tip) on dinner, and it was so lackluster. Here's what we had - \n\n** Mar y montana, sea and mountain ($12): small, just one bite, of iberico meat over sea urchin on toast. Too small of a taste to really appreciate anything. \n** Sopa de ajo ($6): small bowl of bread and garlic soup, with egg. It was good, my husband thought it had a heavy, oil flavor. I thought presentation could be better.\n** Gambas al negro ($14): 3 prawns. no flavor at all, and in fact, it tasted old to me (like that freezer burnt, defrosted flavor). Not a winner.\n** Whole Monterey calamari ($10): 3 calamari pieces. It came out tepid, so that was a bummer. Texture was nice, flavor was ok.\n** Grilled razor clams ($14): 3 clams with some wild ramps inside. This was a little smokey, but it worked well with the lemon.\n** Wood-grilled octopus ($12): we got to try this twice, as the chef sent out a first batch that he thought was too small and then subsequently sent out a little more. The first batch was not good - too chewy, tough and way too smokey (I think it's the paprika).  It came with little slices of potatoes, but it added nothing to the overall flavor. The second batch of octopus that came out was better: hot, good texture, not as smokey. So it may be hit or miss with this one.\n** Grilled albondigas ($11): 3 meatballs of duck/pork. It was coated with what tasted like BBQ sauce, so the meat could have been anything, and I wouldn't be able to tell because of the sauce. The sauce is too smokey.\n**  Vineyard greens ($6): GET THIS ONE! If you get anything on the menu, then get these mustard greens. I know, the simplest thing here on the menu, but the flavors of raisins, pine nuts and garlic are amazing. \n** Grilled Iberico Secreto ($22): Pork slices with watercress. The pork was good, a little tepid, but solid flavor with the simple spices for seasoning. I might get this one again.\n\nFinal tally: Out of 9 plates, just 1 stood out. :(\n\nDrinks: Tried 3 - Andalucia $10 (sherry cocktail, very very sweet), Kalimotxo $17 (wine/cola, sweet), Tariff $12 (gin/orange/cava, slips right down!).\n\nWhat's random: I thought the music didn't really match (for example, I heard a mix of the Fugees, then some Spanish music, then some hip hop).\n\nI wanted to like this place, but the menu needs some adjustment (read: less smokey!).

First of all, I called when it opened for lunch exactly a month before the day I wanted to dine, but was told it was only possible for me to make a reservation at 5:00 PM or much later in the evening, since most tables stay occupied between 6:00 and 8:00 PM...  Okay, 5:00 PM was fine with me.  Then it seemed like he completely butchered my phone number, name, and number of guests.  (It really bothered me, so I called the next day to reconfirm and to make sure everything was correct, which it wasn't; thankfully, the woman who answered this time was MUCH more helpful.  After she finally figured out which reservation was actually mine...)  Unfortunately, this experience made me apprehensive.\n\nFortunately, when we arrived at the pier, we were quickly taken to our table, which was right next to the kitchen.  For the meal we tried:\n\n- Pintxos: The quail egg was my favorite; I probably could have sat there the entire night just eating those.  The combinations were definitely spot on.\n- Patatas bravas: Such a simple dish, yet SOO DELICIOUS!  The garlic aioli that came with it was UHHHMAZING.\n- Gambas al negro: I thought they were perfectly cooked and super juicy.  My girlfriends let me have all the shrimp heads, so that was a bonus for me!\n- Monterey calamari: Pretty good, but I'm a huge fan of squid and felt like I've had better.\n- Octopus: SO UNEXPECTEDLY TENDER!

Probably wouldn't order it again.\n- Paella: SOOO, I had expectations for the paella, and it did not reach my expectations.  There was nothing outstanding about it.  We shared 1 order of the paella between 5 people and that was enough.\n- Churros: DELISH. The raspberry dusting was a great combination.\n\nOur waitress also was very informative and was accommodating in adjusting each dish so that each of us had at least one serving of everything.  We really wanted to try to uni open-faced sandwich, but was told they weren't able to acquire any uni for that day.  The drinks were also great; definitely stand out and interesting.\n\nBUT THE SERVICE. The service started off really well.  Our waitress was attentive, but a quarter through our meal, she stopped serving us without explanation even though she was still serving other tables, and we got another server, who checked in very little.  It seems once we placed our orders they were just waiting for us to finish.  For the price of the meal, the service was definitely not on par and not what I expected.\n\nIn conclusion, it was definitely a must on my list of restaurants to try in San Francisco.  Not a fan of the price tag of each plate for the amount of food you are getting and the service, but the dishes were delicious and I could tell each component of each dish was well thought out.

It's perfectly chic, yet intimate, and the bar seating gives you a front row seat to what looks like Project Runway for cooking -- the backstage step-by-step of how all this gorgeous food gets beautifully prepped and plated. \n\nAfter a month of traveling in Spain, my palette was about 98% Spanish and craving croquetas, jam\u00f3n, manchego, and a nice, crisp gin tonic. Enter...Coqueta. Ok, you'd be hard pressed to find anything outside of Spain that exactly replicates the gastronomy there, but Coqueta gives it a fair shot. The croquetas, jam\u00f3n serrano, and chorizo were pretty spot-on, but most other fare here is more Spanish-inspired, rather than sticking purely to authentic replication. \n\nA little breakdown of the delectable goodies:\n\n+ The Sunny-side up Huevo -- shrimp, crispy potato, chorizo sauce (yes, that's right, CHORIZO SAUCE) - One of the best dishes here, that combines a whole lot of different flavors and textures in one.

Pintxos in Spain are traditionally even larger than tapas, but these \"pintxos\" were just a piece of cheese on a toothpick, and a quail egg on a toothpick, more or less. Not quite creative, nor really what pintxos are meant to be, which are generally more creative combinations.

It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish.

Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest.

He said it was the closest flavors to what he experiences in Spain. He lives in Barcelona six months out of the year. My wife and I visited Spain about 17 months ago and fell in love with the people as well as the food. I also cook Spanish food and paella is one of my specialties. With that being said, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I brought my wife and my mom on this special trip. We arrived 16 April on a Saturday shortly after they opened at 11:30am. We didn't have reservations so they sat us in the bar, which is where we usually prefer to sit anyway. The first thing we noticed was the infestation of flies flying overhead. I mean there must have been close to a couple dozen flying in a group. My mother had a hard time getting up on the bar stool and with the flies near us we decided to sit outside on the bench and picnic table where not a single fly bothered us. I immediately ordered the seafood paella since I knew this would take some time to cook. We also ordered one each of white wine and red wine Sangrias. Both were excellent, but the white was my favorite. We started with El Plat Cap a Chef's selection of cured meats. It consisted of house cured chorizo, fu\u00e9t, and Jam\u00f3n Serrano. First of all the portions were minuscule. For $26 I expected a little more on the platter. The slightly larger than a match stick sized and rectangular shaped salami was underwhelming. The chorizo had little flavor, was not bad, but no wow factor. The Jam\u00f3n Serrano was also underwhelming. All three lacked saltiness and more fat content. Next we ordered hot tapas. Patatas Bravas: very good with hints of smokiness and flash fried crisp served with Bravas salsa and garlic aioli, Pulpo a la Parilla: Wood grilled Mediterranean octopus served with fingerling potatoes and piment\u00f3n olive oil which was cooked perfectly. Although we weren't served a single tentacle, which is my favorite part of the octopus, but what was served was very good. Our last tapas was Alb\u00f3ndigas a la feria, duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry Tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot. These were slightly sweet, tart, tender, and moist. Good, but no wow factor here either. Lastly our paella was served. This was probably our biggest disappointment. I am use to saffron in my paella, which is synonymous with paella. Not a hint was detected. Not enough seafood broth was used either. First of all I couldn't detect any flavors of seafood. The paella had primarily tomato based flavors instead. As a result of not enough broth being used. the paella was dry. The clams were cooked nicely, but the shrimp was kind of mushy in texture, not firm. The house cured chorizo lacked flavor and probably did not belong in this dish. It provided a waxy tasteless texture. For $45 this was a huge failure. I had Mexican (Spanish) rice in a Mexican restaurant more flavorful than this.

We had made reservations through OpenTable and somehow I canceled it and never re-reserved a table. Fortunately the hostess was extremely nice and helpful over the phone and told me they can accommodate us at the bar seating -- fine with us. It was a great first impression for us. When we got there, however, it went downhill. \n\nWe were seated in the bar area as the hostess had informed us. The bar tables are very tiny and cramped but whatever. Not a big deal. We were given paper menus in which you open and presented with a bunch of drinks. I politely asked our server for the food menu and he replied in a condescending tone, \"Open it\". MAI BAD. I didn't know. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n\"Sunny side-up\" Huevo ($13): I love me some eggs, I love me some shrimps, and I love me some crispy potatoes. I would've loved this dish more if it wasn't so incredibly salty! I think they went overboard with the chorizo dressing. However, the egg did help balance out the saltiness a little bit but once that egg was finished, I think I felt my blood pressure rising. Still good nonetheless.\n\nAlbondigas a la Feria ($14): Three pieces of duck and pork meatballs topped with crispy shallots. The crispy shallots complimented the meatballs quite well but that may be a biased opinion because I just loveeeee fried shallots. The meatball was a little overcooked but still enjoyable.\n\nPulpo a la Parilla ($14): A wood fire grilled octopus that was actually really good, I just wish it was more grilled throughout the octopus and not just at the tip of the tentacle. \n\nThen the paella....\n\nThe menu, as well as our server, informed us that it would take about 30 minutes for it to come out which was fine. Lo and behold it only took 1.5 hours, guys. It had already taken almost an hour for our three tapas plates to come out and our octopus was almost forgotten about and our server never knew we haven't received it. Why? Because he never checked up on us to see how we were doing. Great service, right?\n\nWhen paella came out, it was lukewarm like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The rice was straight up burnt and hard to chew and shallow. All the ingredients within the paella was burnt and the sausage tasted like rubber. I called our the server to let him know about the paella and he said, \"let me get my manager\". The manager comes over and asks us what's wrong with it. I said nicely said, \"all the dishes we had was really good except the paella. Everything is just burnt and it's difficult to eat.\" He says, \"Oh really? Did you want another one?\" And we said we didn't want to wait another hour and a half for it. He insists that it won't take that long but we said no. Then he left. Never once did we get an apology from either the server or the manager for the bad execution of the paella. \n\nThe entire time service was incredibly slow and our server rude and had a bad attitude. We never complained about the service or asked where our food was. We waited patiently. And still the guy treated us like lower tier customers.

Being huge fans of Bottega (where we ate the night before), we had high expectations for Coqueta, but have to say food was just okay for the money.  Being right on the water the space has a great feel and the staff in general was great, but from the second you walk in you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for everything (which is the opposite of Bottega).  We went expecting to drop a bomb on food as that was kind of the point of this splurge trip to San Francisco, so didn't mind the high menu prices, but rather the way things were forced on you.  For instance, as soon as you sit down they bring you a tray with about 2 dozen \"bite sized skewers\" (Pintxos) which they present as an amuse-bouche (which is almost expected at nicer restaurants these days); however, once you take one, waitress explains they are $2.50 each (really not worth it for food that has just been sitting out and visited every table in restaurant...ick....and yes, I have spent time in Spain, where this is done at bars, but this just feels wrong). \nMoving on, we each ordered about 2 Tapas plates (there were 4 of us) and Paella....we were going to add on more but waitress said it would be plenty of food.  Since on the topic of pricing, I have to jump forward to our bill before covering food flavor.  When we got our bill we were surprised to to see that we had been charged extra for every single dish...presumably to make it split-able for 4 people....the problem is that the waitress made no mention of this and we did not tell her we wanted to split the dishes (in fact some of the dishes were for certain people as other people at table had food issues and could not split).  It would have been totally been fine if she mentioned this, but instead just decided to add this to our bill which just seemed slimy.\nOkay, so onto the food.\nCroquetas De Pollo:  Tasty fried croquettes....hard to screw up something like this so obviously good.\nGambas al Negor:  Very good and has a nice kick to it with the pepper.\nTotillita de Camaron: Everyone felt this was okay but not great.\nPulpo a la Parilla:  The grilled octopus was highlight of entire meal and wish I just ordered several plates of it.  It was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth.\nAlbondigas a la Feria: The duck meatballs just felt kind felt kind of flat.

It was okay, but dry and really not any better than any standard corner Spanish restaurant (which we have a lot of in NYC).\n\nBy the way, the Sangria is really nice and light and refreshing.\n\nIn summary, it is good and has a great atmosphere, but we weren't blown away and while we expected to spend a lot, felt deceived by how hidden costs were added to the bill.\n\nFinally, I have to say that  I am impressed with how present Michael Chiarello is at his restaurants.

But you're in San Francisco should this is the new reality and with a stunning destination like the reclaimed Pier that Coqueta makes its home, you better believe you are paying for the ambiance in addition to the food they serve. I went to Coqueta only once before, when Chef Michael Chiarello first opening his newest jewel a few years ago and I remembered seeing him cook in the small open kitchen and then walk around and greet his diners. Those days are long gone, but what isn't gone is the large crowds that arrive night in and night out. \n\nThis time around, a friend asked where would I like to eat, and knowing it was a Saturday night, and I was taking BART across the bay, one of the easiest places to get a unique meal was back at Coqueta. With a 7:30pm reservation in hand, we made our way there, once again forgetting that their small entrance is right where the glass of their interior bar meets the cement blocks of where their main dining room and open kitchen resides. With our 7:30pm reservation, the best we could do is get two seats at the bar and I really liked sitting there as opposed to a small two top table because we could see all the cooking going on and you could see some of their handmade Pintxos, otherwise known as bite-size skewers, up close ready to be cooked over a flame. And judging by the size of those small little skewers we already knew we did not want to order those!\n\nBut first we knew we were deciding on cocktails as the bar makes some of the most unique drinks along the bay, with mojitos and margaritas in check filled with lots of visually tantalizing things like edible wildflowers you couldn't go wrong. My dining companion wanted something summery and was thrilled with the price of their Sangria made with red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile and local apples at 9 dollars a glass you couldn't beat this house recipe. I was looking for something more exotic, so I decided to go with the Beso de Carca made with Pueblo Viejo Blanco, lime, raspberry-jalapeno sugar Rose \"Air\" it was a smooth and spicy cocktail that went down just right at an affordable 12 dollars a glass.\n\nFor our dinner, they have a lot of choices on the menu at Coqueta that perfectly encompass what it's like to dine in Spain, from sliced cured meats to Iberian cheeses to Pintxos otherwise known as bite-size skewers they seem to be a fully realized concept that takes you to Spain and back. From their Hot Tapas menu we decided to go with the \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts and topped with chili de arbol and chorizo dressing and the Albondigas a la Feria which were duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots. Both dishes were prepared with such detail, the sunny side up huevo was a rich breakfast dish made especially for dinner and the meatballs were tart yet tasty. For our entree, my dining mate and I decided to split the Lubina a la Brasa which is a wood grilled and semi-boneless Branzino with Manzanilla olive and preserved meyer lemon salsa paired with the Ensalada de Kale which had Lacinto Kale, cana de Cabra, pistachio, tangerine confitura, pickled green strawberries with warm fresh fava and English pea dressing. The branzino was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection and the saltiness of the fish went well with the tartness of the lemon salsa and it paired perfectly with the kale salad. In fact, it was one of the best salads I have ever tasted, yes it was that good.\n\nCoqueta lives up the billing as a unique places for authentic tapas on San Francisco's Embarcadero. For a Saturday night in the freezing cold of winter, the place was packed. We loved sitting on the counter, although we didn't get a great view of the open kitchen, as we literally looked at raw skewers in a glass case, they still had a great energy with all those people inside. It was a little hard to move around but a fun experience nonetheless. I would consider returning for a special occasion as the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get on your dish.

I have never been to Coqueta before but I have seen how beautiful their drinks are here, so I took the opportunity to come here for lunch and we were so glad we came! \n\nThe first impression I had when I walked into this place was it gets rather stuffy on a warm day. The cheeses and cured meats didn't act as a air freshener either, so I was first quite surprised but later adjusted to the smell. We opted to set at the bar to admire their open kitchen. My friend and I settled on ordering a few tapas along with drinks for lunch. Our waitress was a delight and she recommended that for a party of two, it's best to order 4 - 5 tapas to be full for lunch. \n\nWe ordered their famous Gin & Tonics. I got their Barca Gintonic and my friend got their Galleon (both $13) to start. Their drinks are absolutely beautiful with floral pieces floating and the drinks were strong. I liked how our waitress only poured half of the tonic water into the gin to make it strong! The Barca Gintonic was citrusy, refreshing, and delicious. My friend also enjoyed her Galleon but did say it does not taste as strong as the Barca. \n\nFor our tapas, we ordered the following:\n- Croquetas de Pollo ($9) - crunchy on the outside, cheesy, melty, packed with chicken flavor deliciousness on the inside. They paired very well with the refreshing gintonics. \n- Sunny side-up Huevo ($13) - a little bit too oily and salty for our taste but it was still good. Our waiter first served it prior to mixing then proceeded to mix it in front of us at the table.\n- Pulpo de Parilla ($14) - Yum! the octopus was super tender and soft. It was also very fresh since the octopus had a strong taste of the ocean. haha.\n- Albondigas a la Feria ($14) - the meatballs were super flavorful and tender. It was served with some caramelized onions for that salty and sweet flavor that was wonderful.\n- Salmon Alhumado ($8) - Absolutely DELICIOUS! Winner of the day!! Sad that it was $4 for each bite. The smoked salmon was at excellent quality and the truffle honey was mind blowing. The flavor contrast from the salty smoked salmon and the truffle honey paired super well together and the truffle enhanced all of the flavors and blended them together. It was like a flavor explosion in the mouth. Encore!!!\n\nWe were stuffed at the end of the meal and were happy to say the dishes were all very good! Our bill came to be $125 plus tax for two, which definitely is not your normal daily lunch! I highly recommend coming here and just try their gintonics and a few tapas, you will for sure not be disappointed!

All their meats are thoroughly marinated and full of LIFE! I was a little hesitant on eating the pork shoulder because it was still somewhat red, but it had enough sauce and flavor that I didn't taste the medium rare-ness of it.\n\nMy boyfriend told our waiter that it was our anniversary so he said he would work something out for us. (Bf told him while I was in the bathroom.) He ordered the bizcocho de arroz. When our dessert was brought out, our waiter threw in two caramel cheesecake bites for free. The bizcocho had a piece of chocolate that said \"Feliz cumpleanos\" haha but hey, it's the thought that counts. OMG as if the food couldn't get any better. As I've said in many reviews, I've got quite the sweet tooth and both desserts didn't disappoint.\nOh! How could I forget the drinks that we ordered?!

Bread slices that are lightly toasted and spread with tomate. We always order this and layer a couple slices of the Jamon Iberico on top. Delish!\n- Patatas Bravas: If you like french fries, you'll love this dish! It's like the better, more sophisticated version of french fries!

Food was really great.  And the service was amazing!--the place was full but every waitress and server was so polite and happy, and even encouraged me to take more photos! (and I soooo did!  it was so easy to make everything look great--check my pics out!)\n\n1. Sangria (White Win, Roasted Apples, Spices, House Recipe) 750ml Porron $36:  Despite the involved craft, the taste was not as complex as I was hoping.  It was of course good tasting as expected, but probably not as amazing as the description.  5/10.\n\n2. Salmon Ahumado $8:  Ha ha, so they called this an \"open face sandwich\" but seriously, just call it an hors d oeuvre!  Anyway, these will probably be some of the best smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres you've ever seen.  The honey makes it taste a lot more special.  7/10.\n\n3. Huevos Nacional $7:  Like many of the others, this is a masterfully re-envisioned version of a traditional dish.  Never had any deviled eggs like this!  Stuffed with spring peas and smoked pimenton alioli they say.  Very unique.  8/10.\n\n4. Patatas Bravas $8:  Hmmm, very interesting one here.  I would say this would kinda be like an ultra fancy version of tater tots, you know, if you used purple potatoes, smoked them, and made up a fancy dip.  You do taste the special taste of the fresh and fancy potatoes, but personally to me I'd go for a bit more kick.  Sauce is very slightly hot, but barely--could use a bit more heat.  The meat looks beautiful though!  7/10.\n\n5. Croquetas de Pollo $9:  Mmmmmm.... kinda reminds me of similar creations from Porto's in Glendale, but for 2x the price, ha ha.  Probably would fall in the \"comfort food\" category.  Tastes yummy though!  7/10.\n\n6. Albondigas a la Feria $14:  The most unique and complex meatballs I've ever had.  The meat is very soft and juicy on the inside, and though does resemble an Italian meatball, somehow manages to taste and feel totally different!  The outside flavor and sauce is quite strong and distinct.  I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.  Flavor was great though, but unlike the others maybe somewhat traditional.  The drinking chocolate was good but could use more spice.  The sour powder was badass though--great kick.  5/10.\n\nWorks of art to eat.  Wonderful service.

We had a 10:30pm reservation, which was all I could get for a saturday night, but it was fine, we got there around 9pm and sat outside to have cocktails while we waited. The drinks were fantastic. I had a Mojito and my date had a campari cocktail, not sure what the name was but they were both refreshing and yummy. By the way the weather in SF was beautiful and balmy, just like a night in Barcelona. I noticed the bar menu was the same as the main menu so you could easily sit inside or outside on the Embarcadero and have a lovely tapas meal. The wait staff was very good and attentive. We finally got to our table, which wasn't a bad wait since we were both chatting each other up. We ordered a cheese and meat plater to start, El Gran Plat Cap, which was yummy and had a fantastic variety of meats and cheese. We then received the Huevos National which was deviled eggs with a stack of delicious ingredients. I should mention that we ordered a number of tapas and the waitress was very good about seeing where we were at and bringing the next dish as we were finishing the first ones. The meal was nicely paced. We followed the eggs with  Croquetas de Pollo, Patatas Bravas, and ended with Albondigas a la Feria (duck and pork meatballs).

We've all been there).\n\nThey serve a a modern interpretation of traditional Spanish tapas with a twist of northern California flavors. The menu features cured meats & iberian cheeses; cold tapas; open-face sandwiches; a dozen hot tapas; and family-style shared plates.\n\nPretty much, everything I ordered was a winner and there wasn't anything I didn't enjoy. The only thing I regret is not having room for more food (insert: crying emoji).\n\n+ Croquetas de Pollo ($9)\n\nOkay. Hands down... these are my favorite things here. It comes with three chichar\u00f3n-crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured cara-cara oranges. Once you bite through the crispy outer layer, you get a creamy consistency with tender chucks of chicken inside.\n\n+Salmon Ahumado ($8). Omg... that truffle honey... I die.\n\nThis was a nice little palate opener and my 2nd favorite thing here (I'm a huge fan of lox bagels). The combination of the sweet honey + the saltiness of the salmon + the crunch of the crispy bread made it a perfect bite.\n\n+Albondigas a la Feria ($14)\n\nSo bomb. These are grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots.  The meatballs were juicy and tender with a deep brown sear on the exterior.\n\n+Paella: The classic ($45/ serves 2-3)\n\nI can't even right now... (currently: writing this blog post while starving)\n\nHonestly, it's one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThis version is made with bomba rice that nicely soaks up all the flavors of the jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, topped with gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, and broccolini.\n\nWhile all that^ was already bomb, it wasn't until I tasted the lemon aioli till I was REALLY blown away.\n\nSo to sum it all up:\n\nCoqueta is perfect for a nice brunch or dinner date (especially since it's located at Pier 5 along the embarcadero). I'd recommend coming here with friends so you can share everything and order more food. The paella is a MUST (you could prob split that between 4 people) and order more tapas to share.

"], "author": "Kristina D.", "review": "My boyfriend and I decided to come here for a Christmas dinner. We had made reservations through OpenTable and somehow I canceled it and never re-reserved a table. Fortunately the hostess was extremely nice and helpful over the phone and told me they can accommodate us at the bar seating -- fine with us. It was a great first impression for us. When we got there, however, it went downhill. \n\nWe were seated in the bar area as the hostess had informed us. The bar tables are very tiny and cramped but whatever. Not a big deal. We were given paper menus in which you open and presented with a bunch of drinks. I politely asked our server for the food menu and he replied in a condescending tone, \"Open it\". MAI BAD. I didn't know. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n\"Sunny side-up\" Huevo ($13): I love me some eggs, I love me some shrimps, and I love me some crispy potatoes. I would've loved this dish more if it wasn't so incredibly salty! I think they went overboard with the chorizo dressing. However, the egg did help balance out the saltiness a little bit but once that egg was finished, I think I felt my blood pressure rising. Still good nonetheless.\n\nAlbondigas a la Feria ($14): Three pieces of duck and pork meatballs topped with crispy shallots. The crispy shallots complimented the meatballs quite well but that may be a biased opinion because I just loveeeee fried shallots. The meatball was a little overcooked but still enjoyable.\n\nPulpo a la Parilla ($14): A wood fire grilled octopus that was actually really good, I just wish it was more grilled throughout the octopus and not just at the tip of the tentacle. \n\nThen the paella....\n\nThe menu, as well as our server, informed us that it would take about 30 minutes for it to come out which was fine. Lo and behold it only took 1.5 hours, guys. It had already taken almost an hour for our three tapas plates to come out and our octopus was almost forgotten about and our server never knew we haven't received it. Why? Because he never checked up on us to see how we were doing. Great service, right?\n\nWhen paella came out, it was lukewarm like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The rice was straight up burnt and hard to chew and shallow. All the ingredients within the paella was burnt and the sausage tasted like rubber. I called our the server to let him know about the paella and he said, \"let me get my manager\". The manager comes over and asks us what's wrong with it. I said nicely said, \"all the dishes we had was really good except the paella. Everything is just burnt and it's difficult to eat.\" He says, \"Oh really? Did you want another one?\" And we said we didn't want to wait another hour and a half for it. He insists that it won't take that long but we said no. Then he left. Never once did we get an apology from either the server or the manager for the bad execution of the paella. \n\nThe entire time service was incredibly slow and our server rude and had a bad attitude. We never complained about the service or asked where our food was. We waited patiently. And still the guy treated us like lower tier customers. After we had sent away the paella did he FINALLY smile and treat us like royalty. It was so incredibly fake and posh. He gave us complimentary dessert that consisted of cheesecake pops dipped in caramel. Whatever milk they used was so sour and rancid that I almost gagged it out on the table but immediately remembered that I was in public so I held it in. \n\nI rarely experience bad service (minus your hole in the wall Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant -- they don't count) and never have I sent back a dish no matter how bad it was...until this place.

Being right on the water the space has a great feel and the staff in general was great, but from the second you walk in you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for everything (which is the opposite of Bottega).  We went expecting to drop a bomb on food as that was kind of the point of this splurge trip to San Francisco, so didn't mind the high menu prices, but rather the way things were forced on you.  For instance, as soon as you sit down they bring you a tray with about 2 dozen \"bite sized skewers\" (Pintxos) which they present as an amuse-bouche (which is almost expected at nicer restaurants these days); however, once you take one, waitress explains they are $2.50 each (really not worth it for food that has just been sitting out and visited every table in restaurant...ick....and yes, I have spent time in Spain, where this is done at bars, but this just feels wrong). \nMoving on, we each ordered about 2 Tapas plates (there were 4 of us) and Paella....we were going to add on more but waitress said it would be plenty of food.  Since on the topic of pricing, I have to jump forward to our bill before covering food flavor.  When we got our bill we were surprised to to see that we had been charged extra for every single dish...presumably to make it split-able for 4 people....the problem is that the waitress made no mention of this and we did not tell her we wanted to split the dishes (in fact some of the dishes were for certain people as other people at table had food issues and could not split).  It would have been totally been fine if she mentioned this, but instead just decided to add this to our bill which just seemed slimy.\nOkay, so onto the food.\nCroquetas De Pollo:  Tasty fried croquettes....hard to screw up something like this so obviously good.\nGambas al Negor:  Very good and has a nice kick to it with the pepper.\nTotillita de Camaron: Everyone felt this was okay but not great.\nPulpo a la Parilla:  The grilled octopus was highlight of entire meal and wish I just ordered several plates of it.

If I were to be really picky, the only thing that would probably bother me is the size of the pintxos; they were much smaller than we were expecting for $2.50 each.

The octopus was nice and soft and the grilled sausages were also very flavorful; I especially enjoyed the blood sausage. Believe it or not my most favorite thing to eat were the greens, they came in a nice bown and were bitter, yet sweet; they went well with everything.\n\nNow, I'm a big coffee and dessert person but by the end of our meal we were the last ones in the restaurant and I could tell the staff were preparing to close. I got shy and didn't end up ordering dessert even though our server suggested we still could.

To be honest, I really thought this was going to be another one of those fancy, overpriced, uppity restaurants that are littered throughout FiDi. I was wrong. \n\nFor starters, the menu is fantastic and incredibly diverse. This is the rare place where it seems you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. And that's rare. \n\nSo as far as the food goes, I would recommend everything we had. A few highlights are below:\n\n1) Eggplant Brioche Sliders\n\nWhile everything here is good, the eggplant sliders were the real MVP. They must sprinkle fairy dust on them before they bring them out, because these eggplant things take you places you never thought you could go before. And I don't even like eggplant!!! You just simply can't deny that melt-in-your-mouth-ooey-gooey deliciousness that they bring tot the table. \n\n2) Patatas Bravas\n\nThese were also reeeallly good (however, if you come across the reviews that claim these are the \"best ever\" you may need to adjust your expectations, because while they are certainly high-level they are nothing like the real thing you'll get in Spain). But nonetheless, these are quite tasty indeed.\n\n3) Coquettas\n\nThese were pretty tiny size-wise, but flavor-wise very, very awesome. Absolutely packed with flavor, calling the Coquettas \"little chicken pot pie bites\" would not be inaccurate, and these also melted in your mouth. Definitely recommend. \n\n4) Gaucho Bistec\n\nExpensive? Yes. Absolutely f***ing worth it? Yes. This is basically a bone-in Ribeye steak made by the Gods. \n\nBesides ordering almost everything on the menu, we also took a stab at choosing some cocktails as well, and the one I saw come across the table were all really cool. There's definitely something on the drink menu for everyone. \n\nHowever, fair warning to all G&T fans out there - they serve their gin and tonics in a round fishbowl-like glass with grapefruit slice, pine stems, and brightly colored flower. Lovely presentation -- but they really know how to emasculate a dude. I mean, nothing says \"tough guy\" like a cocktail with a flower in it, right?\n\nThe super-colorful Gin and Tonic aside, Coqueta is a terrific place for a special occasion, and an even better place when you're not footing the bill!

I wanted to lick it up!\n\n*  SUNNY SIDE UP :: 5/5 party in my mouth flavor!  love the different textures and who doesn't love a perfectly cooked sunny side egg?  bartender prepared this for us.  some guest may think this dish is too salty, but it worked for me.\n\n*  PLUMA (pork shoulder loin) :: 5/5 stars, loved loved this dish!  I think I had dreams about it for several nights afterwards.  Just the right amount of salt and cooked perfectly.  It was sooooo tender!

I didn't have any crispy kale, at least it wasn't crispy when it arrived at our table.  I also didn't prefer the cheese, too strong IMO for a salad\n\n*  SUNNY SIDE UP :: 5/5 still a party in my mouth and still salty\n\n*  PLUMA (pork shoulder loin) :: 3.5/5 stars, not even close to how good it was last time.  This time the pork was too sweet.  The waitress said they must have put too much sauce on it.  We didn't even pour any on!  Additionally, it seemed way too rare, which wasn't that big of a deal.

I went to Coqueta only once before, when Chef Michael Chiarello first opening his newest jewel a few years ago and I remembered seeing him cook in the small open kitchen and then walk around and greet his diners. Those days are long gone, but what isn't gone is the large crowds that arrive night in and night out. \n\nThis time around, a friend asked where would I like to eat, and knowing it was a Saturday night, and I was taking BART across the bay, one of the easiest places to get a unique meal was back at Coqueta. With a 7:30pm reservation in hand, we made our way there, once again forgetting that their small entrance is right where the glass of their interior bar meets the cement blocks of where their main dining room and open kitchen resides. With our 7:30pm reservation, the best we could do is get two seats at the bar and I really liked sitting there as opposed to a small two top table because we could see all the cooking going on and you could see some of their handmade Pintxos, otherwise known as bite-size skewers, up close ready to be cooked over a flame. And judging by the size of those small little skewers we already knew we did not want to order those!\n\nBut first we knew we were deciding on cocktails as the bar makes some of the most unique drinks along the bay, with mojitos and margaritas in check filled with lots of visually tantalizing things like edible wildflowers you couldn't go wrong. My dining companion wanted something summery and was thrilled with the price of their Sangria made with red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile and local apples at 9 dollars a glass you couldn't beat this house recipe. I was looking for something more exotic, so I decided to go with the Beso de Carca made with Pueblo Viejo Blanco, lime, raspberry-jalapeno sugar Rose \"Air\" it was a smooth and spicy cocktail that went down just right at an affordable 12 dollars a glass.\n\nFor our dinner, they have a lot of choices on the menu at Coqueta that perfectly encompass what it's like to dine in Spain, from sliced cured meats to Iberian cheeses to Pintxos otherwise known as bite-size skewers they seem to be a fully realized concept that takes you to Spain and back. From their Hot Tapas menu we decided to go with the \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts and topped with chili de arbol and chorizo dressing and the Albondigas a la Feria which were duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots. Both dishes were prepared with such detail, the sunny side up huevo was a rich breakfast dish made especially for dinner and the meatballs were tart yet tasty. For our entree, my dining mate and I decided to split the Lubina a la Brasa which is a wood grilled and semi-boneless Branzino with Manzanilla olive and preserved meyer lemon salsa paired with the Ensalada de Kale which had Lacinto Kale, cana de Cabra, pistachio, tangerine confitura, pickled green strawberries with warm fresh fava and English pea dressing. The branzino was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection and the saltiness of the fish went well with the tartness of the lemon salsa and it paired perfectly with the kale salad. In fact, it was one of the best salads I have ever tasted, yes it was that good.\n\nCoqueta lives up the billing as a unique places for authentic tapas on San Francisco's Embarcadero. For a Saturday night in the freezing cold of winter, the place was packed. We loved sitting on the counter, although we didn't get a great view of the open kitchen, as we literally looked at raw skewers in a glass case, they still had a great energy with all those people inside. It was a little hard to move around but a fun experience nonetheless. I would consider returning for a special occasion as the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get on your dish.

Both of the drinks we ordered were so artfully crafted, the flavors were bursting in my mouth.  The food also did not disappoint. We had read no reviews or had heard of this place before we spotted it along the pier. Having no clue on what to order, the waitress asked us about our tastes and recommended some plates.  Because it was tapas, we ordered 5 dishes to share between the two of us (also boyfriend's stomach capacity has no limit).  \n\nOur favorites were the salmon ahumado, the \"sunny side-up\" huevo with shrimp and the Lubina a la Brasa which was a whole grilled Branzino fish.  Their prep and display of food was also very interesting and artistic. Our dishes were placed on wood plate slabs with newspaper cutouts and cast iron skillets.  I'm a sucker for those small touches that make a place unique and special! These details added to the rustic but new age feel of the restaurant.  \n\nAs for the food, the egg was perfect as well as the shrimp and the fish was tender and cooked just right.  The open faced salmon ahumado was so smooth and creamy with a perfect bread crunch! We were sad that were only two per order. \n\nThe servers were very diligent, quick and knowledgeable as well as friendly.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for those wanting to try a place in SF with some flare and character.  \n\nAmbiance: 5/5\nFood: 5/5\nService: 5/5\nOverall experience: 5/5 We had a lovely dinner night out in SF.

Service was overall pretty prompt. \nMy husband and I dined here for our second anniversary and I was hoping as the location is on the water that we would get some romantic setting which we really didn't. There weren't very many seats to be had that had window views at all. The atmosphere is trendy but the tall ceilings made it very loud.\nI husband ordered the Mojito which was nothing like a typical Mojito in all the best ways imaginable.i had the brut bubbly which was perfect.\nOnce we were seated over 40 minutes late when we had a reservation we were crammed into a very tiny space. The table was centered so that the person seating along the fabric benched side of the table was seating in the crack. The waitress did help us move the table but there were only about 4 inches to move it. The sitting part of my dining experience wasn't lovely :/\n\nOur dinner began with the fuet which was fantastic.\nWe next received the Ensalada de Achicoria & Coliflor con Romescu- they were both good but the cauliflower dish was definitely our favorite. If I were dining there again I would probably only order the cauliflower dish.\nAt coqueta they bring around small bite-size bites on Toothpicks called and pintxos.  We were only able to try to of them and one was decent the other was horrible.\n\nOne of the Pintxos- Tortilla de Espinacas - i'm so glad they only had 1left it was disgusting I wish Ihadn't taken a single bite\n\n\nThe Jamn  serano pinto- manchego & apricot- sherry conserva- pretty good\n\nNext we were brought the octopus which had been recommended to us- I'm so glad it was! One of the best octopus I've ever had. \n\nDuck & pork meatballs- they were a little sweet/ my favorite dish of the evening \nOur last item of the meal was the Lubina a la Brasa which is served with the head & with a large wedge of grilled lemon, flake salt, & a green olive & preserved Meyer lemon salsa on the side with a little salsa on top.

My main takeaway was - why haven't I been here sooner?!\n\nThis place is gorgeous.  There is indoor seating, outdoor seating, and sort of a \"greenhouse-looking\" sort of seating area - which is in a smaller space but protected by glass.  We were sat inside the main area, which was absolutely beautiful.  We were all enamored by the very rustic/Spanish decor.\n\nI highly recommend trying out the cocktails - we were literally impressed by every cocktail we tried.  My favorites (and if you like pretty drinks, like I do): \"Barca Gintonic\", \"Spanish Holiday\", and \"The Sun Never Sets.\"  The Barca Gintonic and the Spanish Holiday are both very refreshing and decorated with beautiful flowers.  The Sun Never Sets is like a beautiful dessert with a toasted top - like a merengue!  \n\nWe shared the \"Plat Cap\" to start, which is the Chef's selection of cured meats & we added all 3 cheeses.  This was amazing, and I would definitely recommend.\n\nThe \"Salmon Ahumado,\" which means smoked salmon - was great.  This was perfect because the dish offered 4 pieces, and each piece of bread had a great portion of lox on it.  Really delicious.\n\nNow the \"Pulpo a La Parilla\" - holy smokes.  We had two people in our group who were not huge octopus fans, and were hesitant to try it...but I'm telling you - GET IT.  It's cooked so perfectly, that it's the perfect texture (not rubbery), and it has a deliciously charred flavor to it.  We all ended up fighting over this dish. \n\nIf we thought nothing could top that, we then tried the \"Pluma,\" which is acorn fed, Spanish Iberico de Bellota pork shoulder loin - and GOOD LAWD IN HEAVEN - this was PHENOMENAL.  I can't even begin to describe to you how perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, and flavorful this dish was.  It has a delicious honey flavor to it, and I'm telling you - GET THIS.\n\nLastly, we did share a bunch of desserts.  We tried the \"Tres Chocolates,\" \"Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche,\" \"Carajillo,\" and the \"Manchego Cheesecake.\"  Honestly, they were all delicious.  My personal favorite was the cheesecake. \n\nThe service is PHENOMENAL.  Honestly, we went in there and basically told the server we would like to try his recommendations of the best dishes - and he did not disappoint.  He was very knowledgeable and informed and was very helpful.   \n\nOverall - I'd say DEFINITELY COME HERE.  The venue is gorgeous.  The service is unmatched.  The food is delicious.

Then we stumbled upon Coquette! First impression: damn... this place looks small... we're probably not gonna get a walk-in table... but heck.. i had this place bookmarked for a while and their food looks BOMB AF on yelp. After walking in, the place is actually bigger than it appears and is divided into two areas. The room on the right is for reservations and the patio/bar seating on the left is for first come first serve (self-seat). At 7:45pm, the place was packed but after fishing around for ~5 mins, a party got up and we snagged their table !! woo hoo !\n\nThe seatings in the bar area is so weirdly cute. We were literally eating off a vertical tree log! The vibe was cozy and casual. Not necessarily warm so layer up!\n\nThe GRUBBS:\n\n- Jamon Iberia de Bellota ($29): The bf really like his meats so when he saw this imported cured meat appetizer, he was ecstatic. The app came out in this tiny cute wooden board with slices of thin cured meat imported from Spain. It also came with these cone looking crackers to wrap our meat around. The meat was so flavorful and delicious. Had me licking my fingers after each bite.\u00a0\n\n- Salmon Ahumado ($8): Came in 2 lox bagels topped with smoked salmon, quest fresco and truffle honey. This is by far my MOST FAVORITE dish of the night! Super tasty!!! Never had I thought to eat smoked salmon with truffle honey; the combination of smokey and sweetness was just crazy. I was sooo in love with this dish I had to get seconds!! MUST TRY!\n\n- Mar y Montana ($14): darnns.... This was the one dish that captured my attention the most.... cause of the sea urchin! but it wasn't as great as I'd hope it to be. Pretty bland and boring. The uni was a bit bitter. Definitely prefer the salmon ahumado more. won't order again.\u00a0\n\n- Pulpo a la Parilla ($14): wood grilled Mediterranean octopus with fingerling potatoes. YUMM. The octopus was so tender and slightly chewy! The herbs brought out the taste and paired with the fingerling potatoes was divine.\u00a0\n\n- Pluma ($38): Pork shoulder loin with honey-chilled glaze. OMG. fantastic flavors! Made medium rare, the meat was flavored unbelievably good. Could even do without the honey-chilled glaze! The meat was so juicy and charred with a hint of spice to it. This was the best finishing touch to our meal. left us super satisfied and craving our next return already.\u00a0\n\nDRINKS:\n\n- Barca Gintonic ($13): London dry gin with fever tree tonic grapefruit and thyme. wow. the presentation was so beautiful. Literally looked like a pretty flower garden in a cup. Citrusy, refreshing, and delicious!\n\n- Spanish Holiday ($13): Technically vodka, lemon, and soda. Nothing too special and kinda watered down and not strong.\u00a0\n\nOverall, a great dining experience. Loved the atmosphere and the food. Perfect date spot for couples or a girls night out for drinks and catching up. I advise making a reservation.\n\nIn total, our bill was ~$153 pre-tip.

It has a strong floral smell and the lightest, most refreshing taste. \n\n* Spanish Holiday *\nThis is a gin and tonic with very citrusy and lemony tones. Not as beautiful as the one mentioned above but I personally liked this one better in terms of taste (I love hints of lemon and cucumber). \n\n* Mar y Monta\u00f1a *\nThis appetizer includes two pieces of uni resting on toasted bread, topped with thinly sliced slivers, to the point there's spots of transparency, of melt-in-your-mouth pork. The flavor of the pork masks any taste that the uni has to offer but the texture of the uni makes it feel as though it were a buttery spread. Nothing too special about this dish for me, but if you love uni go for it!\n\n* Pulpo a la Parrilla *\nI've never had octopus taste and feel so much like meat before until I had this dish. The octopus is tender without losing its classic chewiness. You can actually taste the smokiness from when it is wood grilled; SO GOOD! It comes with the most tender and buttery fingerling potatoes that actually taste like legit potatoes; this is a nice contrast to the chewy and flavorful octopus. \n\n* Alb\u00f3ndigas a la Feria *\nThis dish comes with three ginormous, moist meatballs that are absolutely packed with flavor. Each meatball is topped with crispy shallots resting in a tangy sauce that is reminiscent of wine. This is the most delicious (and fancy) meatball I have ever had in my life. Not sure if I would get it again but it was definitely worth experiencing once. \n\n* Pluma *\nThis was my favorite dish of the night. I've never had pork that tasted so sweet and moist on its own. You can drizzle on a honey-chili sauce for even more flavor but it's definitely delicious on its own as well. The meat is unbelievably tender and it's almost like you can taste the acorn-diet of the pig as well; absolutely stunning. I can see myself ordering this dish every time with no regrets.\n\n* Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche *\nThis dessert was recommended by our waitress but unfortunately I don't really see the appeal. The cake is very dry and if it were not for the ice cream on top, I probably wouldn't have been able to eat the cake.

It's simply the tastiest cured meat. \n\nCroquetas de Pollo - 3 skewers of Chicharron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured seasonal citrus. You complement the croqueta with the citrus.  It looked simple, but it was delicious.  \n\nPatatas Bravas - 12 lightly smoked, crispy potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic aioli.

I liked it without dipping it into the salsa. \n\nSalmon Ahumado - 2 smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey on bread. Generous amount of salmon on each bread.

That's when!\"\n\n~3 years ago, the [charming] Italian Food Network personality opened this Spanish tapas restaurant on the Embarcadero waterfront. They serve many Spanish staples, including Spanish cured meats and cheeses, pintxos, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella. Trust a renowned chef like Michael Chiarello to wonderfully elevate Spanish flavors with his own delicious flare.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing here: PLUMA, which is a honey-chili glazed, acorn-fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin (aka the creme de la creme of Spanish piggies). It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish. I'm even obsessed with the bottle of extra HONEY-CHILI GLAZE that it's served with. It is really so fantastic that if I could I would regularly pair it with the many, many steaks that I eat.\n\nThe pulpo a la parilla is also worth ordering, as it's executed just as perfectly as the wood-grilled octopus at Bottega (aka my favorite octopus) with the additional pleasure of that pimenton oil. Yum!\n\nPutting my fangirl enthusiasm aside, Coqueta is good but not good enough to be on my regular rotation of Spanish restaurants. For one, it's a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're not in a big group and want to sample everything (or on a date, for instance). Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest. The Barca gintonic is arguably the best gin & tonic in the city. It's such a beautiful drink with vibrant flavors to match. I was also pleasantly surprised that you can order a porron of wine, which is SUCH a Spanish novelty. I have a porron from Spanish relatives just collecting dust at my house, but seeing it at Coqueta makes me want to bring back the joy of spilling wine everywhere.\n\nOther notes:\n-Open late\n-Front area is nice for hanging out but can get really competitive for space\n-Olives are from the Chiarello Vineyards, not Spain", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["* Pluma (pork shoulder)\n\n"], "author": "Steffi G.", "review": "Omg!! This restaurant lives up to its reviews. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our two year anniversary. When you walk up to the restaurant, it looks like a little shack, but that area was just the bar. To the right of the entrance is the actual restaurant for dining.\n\nOur waiter was awesome. He gave us great suggestions on how to order from the menu. He said typically, people usually order one big entree with three tapas or they order three tapas each. Their most popular entree is the paella, and since I'm not that fond of paella, we opted to order three tapas each. \n\n* Patatas bravas \n* Coles de Bruselas (crispy brussel sprouts)\n* \"Sunny side up\" huevo\n* Albondigas a la feria (duck and pork meatballs)\n* Jamon Iberico de Bellota\n* Pluma (pork shoulder)\n\nI really liked how our waiter paired our tapas together in the order of bringing out the dishes! They're such small dishes that you think you won't be full, but by the 5th dish, you're struggling to eat even just a bite. But SOOO GOOD. \n\nThe potatoes had the right amount of crisp that I like. All their meats are thoroughly marinated and full of LIFE! I was a little hesitant on eating the pork shoulder because it was still somewhat red, but it had enough sauce and flavor that I didn't taste the medium rare-ness of it.\n\nMy boyfriend told our waiter that it was our anniversary so he said he would work something out for us. (Bf told him while I was in the bathroom.) He ordered the bizcocho de arroz. When our dessert was brought out, our waiter threw in two caramel cheesecake bites for free. The bizcocho had a piece of chocolate that said \"Feliz cumpleanos\" haha but hey, it's the thought that counts. OMG as if the food couldn't get any better. As I've said in many reviews, I've got quite the sweet tooth and both desserts didn't disappoint.\nOh! How could I forget the drinks that we ordered?! I got a galleon and bf ordered the barca gintonic. My drink was sweet with strawberries and didn't taste like gin at all.

Even ignoring the price tag, I didn't feel like it was all that great?!?!? Maybe I'm just not a fan of deviled eggs, and PAYING that much for a deviled egg. The flavors were very complex with the bonito and the pickled saffron potato. I appreciated the complexity, but I was still sad that it cost seven freakin' dollars and it didn't rock my socks off.\n\nABONDIGAS, $14 - 4.5 STARS - 3 small meatballs. But, very rich. I cut my meatball into 4 pieces because it was that rich! This is something you want to savor and eat slow. Very rich in duck flavor, extremely soft & tender. Borderline almost falling apart even when moving it over to my plate! The cherry salsa and shallots on top were a perfect complement.\n\nPLUMA, $38 - 3.5 STARS - Everyone RAVED about this, so I ordered it.. and yeah... it was good pork and very tender.

Tasted a bit bland on its own but i guess they wanted the meat to speak for itself.\n\nSETAS AL AJILLO (mushrooms), $10 - 5 STARS - SHIZ. Now these, I can justify paying more for. Perfectly roasted, extremely garlicky, and not too soft. I ate these with the pork shoulder and it made it 100% better, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nOverall, I put down $125 after tax and tip for a satisfying meal.. 2x higher than I'd like but I guess I can check this place off the list since I had been curious about it for a while now.\nDon't think I would return unless a friend picked this place and it was for an occasion!", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-03-16"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the paella and pluma.

I got try a bunch of stuff I didn't have, and they were some of the best items on their menu.\n\nOne thing to note is that their bar is pretty cool.  I never actually hung out there before, but when I had dinner there with a few friends, I arrived early to try their famous Bar\u00e7a Gintonic.\n\nBar\u00e7a Gintonic -- http://bit.ly/1KzsPZL\nBloom London dry gin, Fever Tree tonic with grapefruit and pine.\nA very fragrant, refreshing cocktail that's visually appealing.  Okay it looks like a fish bowl, but still looks awesome.  I'd surely order this again.\n\nIt's also good to know that when you're at the bar, you can also order anything on the menu.  So you can enjoy a few small plates and pair it with some wine or a fancy cocktail.  I still think my favorite drink there is their Porron Kalimotxo that I had before.\n\nWhen it came to dinner time, even though I had been there before, we pretty let our waiter decide what to get on their menu for the most part.  And he hit it out of the park with all his selections.  Here are some of my favorite highlights from our dinner:\n\nGambas al Negro -- http://bit.ly/1FQNqHP\nOlive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce.\nNicely cooked prawns and the garlic flavor was pretty strong.\n\nSalmon Ahumado -- http://bit.ly/1Jlagdh\nSmoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey\nThese were like little fancy lox bagels.  The truffle honey really made them super rich and delicious.  I actually liked these better than their Mar y Montana, but they're not that far off.\n\nPluma -- http://bit.ly/1GTMAfF\nIberico de Belotta Pork Shoulder Loin with Honey Chili Glaze\nMy favorite item of the night.  I think out of all the things I wanted to try, this was my most anticipated.  The pork was so tender, moist, and flavorful, that it really didn't need the Honey Chili Glaze, but the glaze was a great sweet flavor enhancement when drizzled on.

Visually and substantially!  You'd think that even though you're at a fancy restaurant, the portion would be small, but this was a perfectly portioned paella for my group.  It came with huge shrimp and was loaded everything listed above.  Why didn't I order this before???\n\nOverall the dinner was a great experience.  Everyone at the table enjoyed our waiter's personal selections.  When I came back again with another group of friends about a month later for lunch, we pretty much ordered the same things above, plus a few things I had from my past visits like their Duck and Pork Albondigas and Patatas Bravas.

It's best to make a reservation since Coqueta is always packed, but if you don't have one, they have a beautiful bar area with high top tables which is open seating.\n\nAfter eating here a few times, my favorite dishes are:\n- Jamon Iberico de Bellota: It's pricey, but so worth it! This is the gem of Spanish tapas! The Jamon Iberico is thin, delicate, salty, and literally melts in your mouth.\n- Pan Con Tomate: It's simple. Bread slices that are lightly toasted and spread with tomate. We always order this and layer a couple slices of the Jamon Iberico on top. Delish!\n- Patatas Bravas: If you like french fries, you'll love this dish! It's like the better, more sophisticated version of french fries! The patatas bravas are crispy and have a hint of smokiness. Each piece has a dollop of garlic aioli on top and a side of bravas salsa to dip in. Perfect finger food for sharing!\n- Albondigas a la Feria: Hands down some of the best meatballs I have ever had! The duck and pork mixed together give such rich flavor. And the salsa on top sort of tastes like a quality barbecue sauce. A must at this restaurant!\n- Pluma: My family and I about fell off of our seats when we tried this dish! The pork shoulder loin was so tender and juicy! And the honey-chili glaze just took it to another level! This dish was insanely good. It seemed like such a simple concept, but it was seasoned so well and was simply delectable. \n\nTheir drinks at Coqueta are also very creative! Some of them are garnished with flowers and other interesting ingredients. It's unique and different and it works!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-03-07"}, {"excerpts": ["x Pluma = DIY pork shoulder Mexidonut sandos.\n\n", "(^_^) Pluma $38 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=lnQOG4qqY5kezpXNfDcXwA)\n"], "author": "Dan B.", "review": "Get shameless and ask for the dessert menu first.

I got the conquistador and my husband the cocktail with Iberico infused gin. Mine was very light and fresh with notes of fennel and anise, and his savory with ham and citrus. So different and delicious. We were seated and decided to start with the meat and cheese board. Fantastic selection! It had tomato sauce, marcona almonds, some breads, and an amazing sugar crusted thin bread. We then proceeded to the quail eggs bites that were pickled and had mustard seeds. Freaking delicious. We also had the croquettes and meatballs- both were recommended and both delicious. The duck and pork meatballs were so juicy and had an amazing cherry sauce with bits of fried shallots on top. We shared the pluma- an Iberico pork shoulder loin with honey chili glaze. It was cooked to perfection! Our server recommended the wild mushrooms with chili and garlic. Sooo good.

After fellow yelper, Rodney's review, I knew this was a must pit stop while in SF. I was in luck when I got reservation!\n\nWe got there early and was seated in a room that is adjacent to the actual dining area, this area has the bar and a few seats where people sat and drank as well. We ordered a drink to start the night, the Kalimotxo which has Mexican Coke, Red Sangria, and Cinnamon. This drink was full of flavor but resides a bit on the dry side. It is only served in a party pitcher (500 mL). \n\nWe were shown to our seats promptly, matter of fact, 10 minutes before our actual reservation time.  Our server, Lowell was AWESOME from the beginning. He is very knowledgeable of all the amazing food and drinks Coqueta serves. After we looked at the menu and made our choices, he picked and chose the order of our food and he was spot on! \n\nUnfortunately, I really wanted to try the \"Mar y Montana\", but they were sold out of the sea urchin (this gives me the perfect excuse to come back!).\n\nThe patatas bravas (freshly dug, crispy new potatoes, lightly smoked, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli). It was flavorful and the potatoes are perfect bite size pieces. The garlic alioli and salsa help brought out the flavor of the smoked potatoes. There was a great balance of salty and sweet.\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas (served alongside with cured cara-cara orange) (3 pieces). These puppies were like mini pot pies, bursting with richness in flavor! Super creamy and packed with great seasoning. The cured orange was served alongside with the croquetas, but I didn't try them. \n\nGambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on Gulf prawns with black garlic and chili). This was an amazing dish. Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert.

Arriving on a recent Sunday evening, the bar was packed, but the dining room was just filling up.  By the time we left, the restaurant was pretty much full.  Knowing it was close to the Ferry Building, I did not know the location until after driving around the block searching for a parking space.  It's actually closer to the end of Broadway than the Ferry Building.  The reception person was clearly organized in dispatching diners with reservation to various locations.  We were seated at a table near the one-bite station and open kitchen.  Our server was very kind in explaining the menu and giving recommendations.  After a short deliberation, here's what we ordered:\n\nApps\n1) One bite skewers (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tbcHWormA0lh3ONQXvYYQQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My choices were the chorizo with roasted artichokes and Piquillo peppers and quail egg Diablo respectively.  Chorizo was bolder flavor wise while the quail egg, likened to deviled egg by our waiter, was nondescript.  \n\n2) Wood grilled octopus (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_zYv9GF48YSlqDboDl5hbg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Had a difficult time distinguishing the fingerling potatoes from the octopus pieces.  \n\n3) Grilled beef short ribs (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0AfsjZ6uI0XpW7t8m9mdxA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Liken this to Korean kalbi without the sweet barbecue sauce, but with a chocolate sauce and pomegranate seeds.  Again, didn't really stand out.\n\n4) Grilled Albondigas (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=v6MIbT2IA0LAZ0riy10GdQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Three meatballs were perfectly apportioned for the three of us.  Good savory taste.\n\n5) Gambas -  Head on Gulf prawns, poached in olive oil with black garlic and chili.  Wasn't bad and even crunched on the heads, but wasn't anything special.\n\nShared large plates\n6) Pluma (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=liXPgFbmYwr39AWrR-T8gA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Roasted pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze cooked medium rare, a first for me with pork meat.  If I had a few drinks, might have mistaken this for a nicely done steak.\n\n7) Arroz Cremosa (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-vAeq_lBdaM6wMyJFB2fzQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Risotto like dish touted as Chef Michael's personal favorite, garnished with chopped dayboat scallop pieces and squash with blossoms pieces.  \n\nDessert\n8) Churros with chocolate sauce (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=abFvOlOuuJgo4kdDZb3X6g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -  Served slightly warmer than warm, there were four pieces.\n\nMy dining companions, knowing how I enjoy Yelping restaurants, asked me what I thought.

I'm a fan and will come back. Ambiance is trendy young professional. Cool setup and by the pier. Server was good though had a lot of tables to care for. \n\nWe ordered the Jamon Iberico de Ballota. For the uninitiated, Jamon Iberico is imported black Iberian pigs. Ballota means they were fed acorns and is considered the finest type. Very good and distinct nutty flavor. You get six slices and it's a little pricey. Worth it if you're into this kind of thing. \n\nNext the Quail egg Diablo. Neat take on a deviled egg. Nice little bite. \n\nLet's talk about the red kale salad. You should get this. Nice assortment of flavors and textures that come together very well. Pumpkin seeds, roasted squash... Mmmm\n\nMar y Montana sea and mountain. Iberico Laredo over sea urchin and Jamon Iberico de Ballota. Delicious. One thing SF is dependable on is good sea urchin. One of my favorite dishes here. \n\nThe wood grilled octopus was my favorite dish. It's cut into small pieces and the increased surface area really picked up the olive oil and pimenton. Definitely my favorite. \n\nSunny side up egg and shrimp. Great presentation and fun to eat. Break the egg and mix with the shrimp and crispy potato. Runny eggs are the key to my heart\n\nGrilled albondigas. Duck and pork. Good. Heavy. Filling. I always end up with albondigas at the end of tapas and I'm always full. It's not fair to the albondigas. Nevertheless it was good. Maybe ask for it earlier\n\nNow...  About the cocktails. Championship Policy has gold in it. Seriously, an amazing visual effect. The main flavor that stands out is the Vermouth carpano antica and the smoke. Raisins at the bottom collect the gold for further visual effect. \n\nHighly recommended.

Then, there was Ryan Scott. He was taking my order at his food truck when I got tongue tied and blurted something that wasn't even on the menu. When I went to his pop-up restaurant, I sat there mesmerized. Like a Kelly Kapowski-Jeff crush, I had a silly grin on my face while batting my lashes the entire time during brunch as he sat at the table next to us. \n\nAnd, then there's Michael Chiarello. I grew up watching him along with Yan Can Cook on PBS and followed him on the Food Network while rooting for him on Top Chef Masters and The Next Iron Chef. He's like the Richard Gere in the foodie world with a charismatic personality that's super lovable. So naturally, when I read he was opening a new restaurant in SF, I JUST had to go.\n\nAlthough Chef Chiarello specializes in Italian influenced Californian cuisine, his new baby, Coqueta focuses on Basque cuisine (Spanish tapas). Considering it's located in a prime real estate location, expect prices to be high because you're paying for the ambiance and the waterfront view after all. The menu is quite extensive with small bites, cold tapas, hot tapas, and larger family style plates: http://www.scribd.com/doc/136022919/Coqueta-Final-Opening-Menu. Two to three dishes per a person is recommended but portions are small so if you have a large appetite, definitely skip the skewers and open faced sandwiches (they can easily rack up $$$) and get a rice or pasta dish as a filler.   \n\nThere was some mixed reviews so we were conservative with our order. I'm glad we didn't over-order as we usually do because the food was good but not as spectacular as Lolinda and Contigo (my two favorite higher end tapas restaurants in SF). I expected a bit more from Chef Chiarello in terms of flavor and execution but the creative menu, presentation, amazing cocktails and impeccable service more than made up for it.\n\nC O C K T A I L S:\nHats off to the mixologist for making AHHHH-MAZING cocktails. I started off with the Tariff Cocktail ($12) made with jamon iberico infused gin which had a delicious smokiness: http://bit.ly/13kNED8. But the remarkable Barca GinTonic ($12) is what will bring me back to Coqueta: http://bit.ly/ZCb3vM. Who would have thought something as simple as gin, tonic, and grapefruit would be so ahhh-mazing?

The croquettes which were like fried pieces of chicken pot pie; super mouthwatering with a decadent creaminess. As one of my favorite cuts of meat, the pork shoulder was rich, fatty, and full of intense porkiness. I absolutely adored the glass honey jar it was presented with. The vineyard greens were a good dose of fiber with a lovely sweetness from the raisins and the nutty crunch from the pine nuts. The chorizo was like cold salami chunks and the too smoky octopus needed a citrus punch so skip these. And, while the smoked salmon open faced sammie was delectable, $5 was excessive for an amuse bouche sized sammie. Dessert was wildly creative. The sangria popsicle with nostalgic pop rocks definitely won me over the too pungent manchego cheesecake pops.  \n\nS E R V I C E\nMichelin-star quality service, the genuinely warm staff are well-seasoned and run a tight ship. You would have never known that last night was only their fourth opening night. Special shout-out to our waiter, Kyle. He was super personable, down-to-earth, and attentive.

Need I say more. However, my cynicism was tempered somewhat by a distant memory of a fine meal I had at Tra Vigne soon after he opened that restaurant in Napa back in the late 1980's. Now I've never been to Bottega, and with so many dining options in Yountville, it never hit my must-try list. But the buzz around Coqueta, his first foray into Spanish cuisine, piqued my curiosity enough for me to see if a reservation could be secured at the last minute on Friday. \n\nSure enough, there was one at 5:30, so I grabbed it even if it meant Jamie W. and I had to hustle our butts out of work to get there on time. I'm familiar with the high-ceiling space since Lafitte served my favorite Pimm's Cup in the city, no small feat and alas only the Pimm's 74 at RN74 is left to salve my wounded liver. The decor doesn't look hugely different, but the heavy wood tables and colorful Fiesta ware definitely felt Madrile\u00f1o to me (photo: http://bit.ly/ZInaY5). The menu of small and large bites was still on a folded piece of paper and included their cocktails as well (7 photos starting with: http://bit.ly/13rgn9m). Waiting for Jamie, I wasted no time in ordering the $12 Engine Co. #5 (photo: http://bit.ly/121Tw3Z).\n\nIt was a smooth mix of Dancing Pines Bourbon, Tobacco-Infused Sherry, Lemon and Zurracapote (a sangria-like drink). Refreshing and gone so quickly as the weather is starting to warm finally. I was convinced by a passing server to try a trio of the Pintxos at $2.50 a pop. After all, she was carrying a plank with all of the different selections organized like little soldiers with their sabers bolted into the wood (photo: http://bit.ly/XQxMaR). I chose the Quail's Egg 'Diablo' with Pickled Mustard Seed and Jam\u00f3n Serrano, the Chorizo with Roasted Artichoke and Piquillo Peppers, and the Jam\u00f3n Serrano with Mancheco and Apricot-Sherry Conserva (photo: http://bit.ly/15yzu5c).\n\nThey were delicious but almost too quick to appreciate the creation behind them. Also on the small side was the $5 Smoked Salmon Montadito with Queso Fresco and Truffle Honey (see photo). It was really a glamorously Catalan version of a bagel with cream cheese, and my only regret is that it wasn't a bigger nosh. The $8 \"Tattas\" Bravas were upscale tater tots made all the more alluring with Jam\u00f3n and Bravas Salsa and Aioli (photo: http://bit.ly/15yzRNd). They simply melted in our mouths with little effort. The $12 Wood-Grilled Octopus was succulent with just the right amount of char as the pieces were accompanied by Fingerling Potatoes, Piment\u00f3n and Olive Oil (photo: http://bit.ly/ZDdq5l). Octopus has never tasted so savory good, and the main events had yet to arrive.\n\nThe $22 Arroz Cremosa was a wondrously luxuriant risotto with Slow Cooked Bomba Rice and Day Boat Scallops that were meltably tender accompanied by English peas (photo: http://bit.ly/ZImRMO). But the centerpiece of the evening was the $38 Pluma, incredibly tender slices of Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota Pork Shoulder Loin which you drizzle with the Honey-Chili Glaze (photo: http://bit.ly/XQy1Tm). Even though the price was a bit mind-boggling for the portion, we wouldn't hesitate to order that dish again. What was nice was that Chiarello served it himself and told us he had to serve what is easily his favorite dish. He barely stayed to chat, but I was able to tell him I think he made the transition from Italy to Spain with ease. The $6 Catalan-Style Vineyard Greens with a Caper Raisin Puree made an excellent side dish among the excessive carnivery.\n\nI was working my way through my second cocktail, the $12 Castro, a refreshing mix of Espolon Tequila Blanco, Curacao, Fina Sherry, Fresno Pepper and Lime (photo: http://bit.ly/ZDdBOf), when we decided to share the $8 Asturian Apple Pie, a rather Viennese-looking pastry with apples sliced on top and with a canela of Cabrales Blue Cheese Ice Cream (photo: http://bit.ly/17HBHIh).

Well, in fact, this was the third time she's treated us to Coqueta since my first review back in September.

Our waitress was helpful and attentive, wishing me a happy birthday since my boss had told everyone of my upcoming day of birth. \n\nI had the Engine Co. #5 for my cocktail which was tart and strong, just how I like it. \n\nWe ordered three of the *El Gran Plat Cap* (assorted meats / nuts / cheeses) - this is always a good choice as there's a lot of variety and it's cured meats and great cheeses, you can't eff this up\n\n\n~Some of our Tapas~\n \n*Pimientos de Padron* - a favorite and also difficult to eff up, roasted peppers with Jamon Serrano, sherry vinegar, and coarse sea salt\n\n*Albondigas a la Feria* - meh, these duck / pork meatballs were super oniony, with crunchy onions inside and more caramelized on top. Also I got a tendon kind of texture that ruined the meatball for me, I took one bite and didn't have any more\n\n*Patatas Bravas* - ugh, I was so disappointed in the little fried potatoes both last time and this time getting them. In September they were heavenly: light and crispy. But each time since then, they've been oily and dense\n\n*Croquettes de Pollo* - another let down, and sadly so, as they were a favorite in the past. The filling of chicken and peas had a curdled texture and an overly oniony after taste and was not hot inside the breaded casings\n\n*Salmon Ahumado* - little open-faced salmon sandwiches. Sooo fishy. And way too cheesy. The Queso Fresca was piled high and the salmon was slimy and gooey with truffle honey.

I didn't have any crispy kale, at least it wasn't crispy when it arrived at our table.  I also didn't prefer the cheese, too strong IMO for a salad\n\n*  SUNNY SIDE UP :: 5/5 still a party in my mouth and still salty\n\n*  PLUMA (pork shoulder loin) :: 3.5/5 stars, not even close to how good it was last time.  This time the pork was too sweet.  The waitress said they must have put too much sauce on it.  We didn't even pour any on!  Additionally, it seemed way too rare, which wasn't that big of a deal.  Pork was still tender though.\n\n*  GAUCHO BISTEC :: 4/5 stars, good but not OMG great.  It did have a good char on it... something I miss from our cooking, since we're not allowed to have grill at our place.  sorry big green egg, you will be in use again some day!

Lately, we've been having Spanish/tapas style food and it just so happens that Coqueta was also one of those restaurants. Anyways, we booked reservations about two weeks in advance for a lovely Saturday lunch. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately at one of the corner booths. The 4 of us each got our own drinks and shared these 8 dishes:\n\nBarca Gintonic: A really beautiful drink. I'm actually not a big fan of gin in general because of its taste, but after having Coqueta's, I really liked it. It was very refreshing with a bit of a floral/fruity taste. A bit expensive for a drink though.\n\nChorizo: Just OK. The chorizo came as bite-size skewers with roasted artichokes and piquillo pepper. For the portion size, it was quite expensive and not worth it. Least impressive dish. \n\nSunny side-up egg with Shrimp and Crispy Potato: YUM. One of my favorite dishes even though it was a bit oily... The server would burst the egg yolk and mix it with the shrimp and crispy potatoes. The potatoes were really crispy, so when you eat all three together in a mixture, it had the perfect crunch to it. Nice texture to it. I think this dish would be perfect for brunch. \n\nWhole Monterey Calamari on the Plancha: Not your normal crispy calamari. Really liked the squid ink alioli with the calamari. Calamari was fresh and chewy. \n\nPaella: I have had paella at several other restaurants before. Honestly, it was just OK. The paella came with root vegetables, chorizo, prawns, clams, and lemon alioli. The lemon alioli paired well with the paella. Otherwise, nothing really stood out. Some of the seafood tasted a bit too fishy for me. :/\n\nPluma (Pork Shoulder Loin): Just OK... It was pretty tender, but nothing too special. It was already flavorful enough without having to pair it with the honey-chili glaze.\n\nSetas al ajillo: My other favorite dish of the night! Loved the flavors to the mushrooms. I felt healthy just eating it. It wasn't too heavy nor too oily. \n\nGrilled Albondigas: Duck and pork meatballs. At first bite, the texture was a bit weird for me.. It was a bit mushy, yet bursted with flavor... but past that, it was really delicious. A bit heavy, hearty, yet juicy.\n\nChurros with drinking hot chocolate and mixed berry powder: Dip the churro first into the mixed berry powder and then into the hot chocolate. It tasted very yummy! I really liked the combination of the two. A good way to end a delicious meal.\n\nWhat really bugged me was that there were quite a few flies at our table. Every time we tried to eat or drink, there was always at least one buzzing around. It was quite annoying.. :( Anyways, service was excellent. Our water cups were always refilled and our plates were changed each time we got a new dish. The overall meal was quite expensive as it added up. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food and I would say that Coqueta is one of the better restaurants for tapas style/Spanish food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-04-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Pluma - Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey chili glaze.

Sometimes a brutha has to cross international boundary lines with the FOB palette. There's only so much Chinese and Japanese one can handle.  \n\nSince \"izakaya\" has been remarketed as \"Japanese tapas\", it was high time to try the original Spanish version at a place that's been picking up steam...or shall I say Spanish Izakaya. Or Spanish \"dim sum\" meant to be drowned with alcohol and cocktails. As you can see I still have the FOB judge hat on!\n\nAnd Coqueta is a pretty fancy one at that. Made a reservation via opentable about 5 hours prior and got seated at the counter. Other than the pretty uncomfortable seating arrangement, the upside was getting a full view of the action, and some interaction with the friendly kitchen staff which was really cool. Have no clue who Mike Chiarello is other than what I've read, and don't think he was there last night. But no matter, I was there for food and company, not for fawning. \n\nThere are far more experienced Spanish food and tapas eaters who know this stuff hot and cold better than I do. \n\nKing of FOB food was once again put in charge of ordering, which in foreign territory can be a bit daunting, but fun at the same time. With a little Yelp from my friends (thanks Cherylynn N!) I took the reins and ordered a bit too much food.\n\nJamon Iberico de bellota - F**K Kobe beef BS! This is it! Not to say that A5 Wagyu is bad...but a premium slice of pedigree Spanish ham is one of those must try before you croak experiences, particularly if you are a huge pork fan. One kitchen staffer described it as \"Kobe pork\" (word bleh) but yeah I am well aware of what this stuff can do to you and your wallet. Nutty (from the free range Iberico black pig being fed a steady diet of acorn), the right balance of salt, fat, umami, with a slight hint of sweetness...the paper thin slices are delicate and put so many other kinds of ham to shame. They say YOLO, I say try this! \n\nJamon Serrano - this is a much cheaper ham that Coqueta cures in house. It's quite salty but otherwise good, and a staffer was kind enough to offer us a slice to sample. \n\nBeet salad - Good. If you mess up a simple salad using quality ingredients from down the street (Ferry Building Farmers Market) don't even bother.\n\nHouse cure white anchovies (cold tapas) - The biggest downer of the evening. Super duper trooper SALTY. At least the sour accent shined. If it wasn't salty this could have been pretty decent. \n\nCrispy shrimp and chickpea flour pancake with saffron alioli - fried stuff may always taste better, but is not easy to nail down which these guys did. Not greasy...and good quality shrimp. I doubt you can even find good regional Cantonese fried lotus root slices stuffed with shrimp paste renditions in town, and this trumps most Korean style pajeons around. Bravo!\n\nWood grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes, pimento, and olive oil - Sweet fingerling potatoes, and a perfectly tender octopus with a delightful chew/bite. Only certain European (and Japanese preps) of octopus are truly noteworthy. Loved it.\n\nPluma - Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey chili glaze. Yes, 8 pieces for $38 is not cheap...but it's acorn fed Iberico free range black pig, shoulder cut. Plus woodfire grilling done right. Phenomenal texture and control of the flame, a little salt rub and it has a delightful juice bite with a smooth tender chew. It's not fatty, but it's not dry and skinny either (well marbled but you can't tell). It's basically Spanish version of cha siu (Cantonese BBQ pork, shoulder cut is used too), especially with the honey chili glaze you can squirt over. If anyone travels to Hong Kong, Tin Lung Heen does an Iberico pork cha siu\n\nhttp://www.foodspotting.com/places/311881-tin-lung-heen-restaurant-hong-kong/items/342-chinese-roast-pork\n\nTo try next time: grilled branzino!\n\nVineyard greens - Catalan style, Caper raisin puree, with raisins, pine nuts, and garlic. Quite bitter and a touch salty with interesting textures and tastes from the other things inside. Probably needs to be washed down with alcohol.\n\nDessert: \n\nChurro Fantasia - crispy Spanish doughnuts with drinking chocolate and mixed berry powder. Solid, very nice and toasty. After this I don't want Costco, Flea Market, or County Fair churros ever again.\n\nStrawberry plum gazpacho with liquid nitrogen frozen blood peach neblina. Pictures\ndescribe it better than I can. Very nice.\n\nToo full...all that was food for two. Had to cancel the skewers/Pintxos.\n\nLots of photography opportunities here...staff preparing appetizers with uni and lardo, desserts, cheese platters, the big ass jamon iberico leg to the side, good looking people eating around, the Pintxos tray, good looking people.

"], "author": "Lisa I.", "review": "So, I'll admit to something: I haven't been this excited about a place since State Bird Provisions.  At the same time, I mean, how could you not be excited about Coqueta?  Add Michael Chiarello, a prime location on the Embarcadero, a beautifully crafted menu, and of course, Iberico pork, things are going to shake out pretty nicely.  I made a reservation for an early Sunday dinner about a month ago (after constantly checking and finally succumbing to a 5:15pm rez on Sunday).  After torturing myself with all of the amazing Yelp pics, I saved all my calories for this and it was going to a be a no holding back experience.  The results were as follows:\n\nCocktails:\nBarca Gintonic: I chose this after seeing all of the beautiful pictures of it on Yelp!  This G&T is a little sweeter than what I'm used to, but I still drank all of it.\nTariff: Greg selected this after reading that the gin used was infused with Iberico jamon. After trying it, I couldn't really taste an essence of pork, but there was a strong flavor of apricots and orange.  A creative and new take on the G&T!\nEngine Co. #5: Greg also selected this after finishing the Tariff since he enjoys bourbon, and was interested in trying tobacco infused cream sherry.  The drink was definitely strong, and I will say that to enjoy it, you must really love bourbon.\n\nOk, and now my friends, on to the food!\n\nTapas:\nChicken and English pea coquetas: The cheese to everything else was great, but was lacking a little bit of salt. The best way to describe this is a mini chicken pot pie inside a tater tot.  We were so-so on this.\n\nSerrano ham & Manchego cheese: We elected this since pork is an absolute must here, and Greg's a fan of Manchego cheese.  Both items we selected were delicious, and the portions of both cheese and jamon were just right.  What was also great about this is that we selected these two items separately and it came out presented beautifully paired with some olive oil crackers, a fig paste, and some salted toasted nuts.  Absolutely delicious and would highly recommend.\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizon dressing: I selected this dish because I really enjoy my fair share of camaron y huevo y chorizo.  Greg wasn't a huge fan of this dish mostly because he wasn't sure how all of the elements on the plate fit together, but I was sold on it.  The chorizon dressing on it really nailed it, and the runny egg added to the flavor of the sauce.  I recommend ordering this.\n\nDuck and pork meatball: Definitely a unique flavor profile, the duck added some fattiness, the cherries were sour but added a great taste, and the crispy shallot on top added texture to the overall meatball.  This isn't your standard meatball you get - THIS IS A MEATBALL. Greg and I agreed that this would be a dish we'd order again.\n\nPluma: If you're only going to have one meal, make it this. Actually, if you're only going to go out for a fancy dinner and absolutely must have pork, you must eat this.  Of all the places I've been to (and I'd like to think I've been to a lot of places), I've never been blown away like this by a first bite.  First off, let's talk about the exterior. The crust of the pork is absolutely perfect and comes served with a light dusting of salt.  On top of that, the honey chili glaze, which comes with a warm bottle of extra in case you want more, gives it a little bit of sweetness to go alongside the juicy meat.  Next, the interior: If you were to look at this, you wouldn't know it's pork.  In fact, the juiciness and the beautifully cooked meat is similar to that of what you'd find in a prime cut steak.  And when I mean it's cooked perfectly, I mean, it is absolutely cooked perfectly.  Big ups to Coqueta for creating such a beautiful and delicious dish! Greg admits that he'd come back here just for this, and wouldn't share it with me.  #sorryimnotsorry\n\nAnd of course, what is a beautiful Spanish meal without dessert!\n\nManchego cheesecake lollipops with caramel popcorn: Delicious (and was given to us on the house) but incredibly rich in cheese taste.  Having had the Manchego earlier, both of us were on cheese overload.  But we ate it anyway.  I do enjoy caramel popcorn, so the two combined were delicious.  I think if we had our choice, we'd opt for a different dessert, but wasn't upset about getting it.\n\nChurros with chocolate sauce/berry powder: So, what about this combination seems odd to you?  Berry powder?  How does that work?  Surprisingly, it's an interesting way to eat a traditional dessert like a churro.  Accompanied with a chocolate sauce, the berry powder is meant to be used with the churro.  Like I said, really interesting stuff, and very thought-provoking concept.  The churro itself was just OK, Gitane's donuts are still one of my favorite items I've had recently.\n\nOk so, if you couldn't tell, I love this place and will be coming back.

After a month of it opening we finally got to last night.  I tend to feel a little lukewarm towards tapas restaurants, but Coqueta blew us away.  The food was excellent and the service was knowledgeable and as top notch to match. I loved how we got a big round table to sit (table size for four), so he and I could sit next to each other making it easier to share.Since bf was so eager about being at Coqueta, we went a little crazy with our ordering.  \n\n*White wine sangria ($9): Probably the best sangria I've ever had.  So light and refreshing, you don't really taste the wine much, but it's not sweet either..if that makes sense?\n*He got a red..forgot which one!\n*Chorizo & roasted artichoke & piquillo pepper bite ($2.50/each): How can you not like sausage?  The chorizo was a little milder than what I'm used to so the artichoke & pepper stood out more.  But all-in-all, a nice bite.\n*Jamon Serrano bite ($2.50): Serrano ham with manchego cheese & apricot.  I loved this & generally I'm not too big on ham or apricot.  The cheese was mild yet distinct enough and everything tied well together.\n*Smoked Salmon open faced sandwich ($5):  OMG this was one of my absolute favorites here & I usually don't like salmon because I find the \"fishy\" taste to be strong every time I've had it.  I absolutely loved the creamy queso fresca and the truffle and honey were divine.\n*Chicken & English Pea Croquettes ($9): How do you not like something breaded and fried?  Our waiter perfectly put it, \"it's like chicken pot pie filling.\"  And he was so right!  Creamy chicken and pea filling!  So good!\n*Tattas bravas ($8): crispy potato and ham nuggets with aioli.  It was our least favorite, but still good nonetheless.  I liked how it was the perfect ratio of potato, ham, and crispiness.  \n*Tortilla Andres ($6): Mix of sweet onion, potato, asparagus topped with piquillo pepper aioli.  This is a cold tapas.  I loved this.  Good carby but veggie filled tapa to fill you up.  The aioli was what this cold dish needed as well.\n*Crispy Shrimp ($10): Little shrimps fried with chickpea flour to make a crisp pancake served with saffron aioli.  Some of the shrimps tasted a little seafoody, otherwise this dish worked.  Again, anything fried crisp is pretty much a winner.\n*Pluma ($38): Our waiter described it kobe-like pork.  And it pretty much was!  It's a pork shoulder loin served with a honey chile sauce on the side.  The pork was so tender, juicy and had a wonderful nutty texture to it.  It was charred nicely too.  It looked more like steak than pork.

You can tell that this pig, this pata negra, lived a great life. The meat was sweet, although pork shoulder can be a bit tough, which this was. Slightly. The glaze itself is tasty, and I'm sure people love to slather their pork with it, but I used it a bit sparingly. I would have loved to have a side of Maldon/sea/kosher salt. I like my meat simple. I'm kinda like a cavewoman in that way.\n\nI was pretty full by this point, but I *had* to have dessert. You know, for research purposes. We had all of the dessert pinxtos: Manchego cheesecake (YES!) skewer (BOO!) with caramel popcorn, salted caramel skewer (meh -- you've had one salted caramel, you've had them all), pate de fruit skewer (tasty, but you gotta be in the mood for pate de fruit), and two white and dark chocolate-covered olives (this is never a good idea, ever). We also had an amazing apple tart (OMG) served with some Cabrales blue cheese ice cream, which we devoured. I don't remember the prices, but they're in the $4-10 range.\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was a fantastic Latina woman with jet-black, lovely hair. She was fantastic. The rest of the team was also on point, making sure our water glasses were always filled, our napkins were folded upon returning to our chairs, clearing away empty dishes promptly, etc. We showed our appreciation by leaving them more than 20%.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nI really love what they did to that space. The architects and designers managed to create a warm, casual and modern atmosphere out of essentially an old pier in a cold and foggy city. One would think that with all the diners in the room, with all this concrete and huge space, that it would be noisy. It wasn't too bad (and my boyfriend's kind of a low-talker sometimes, and I'm kinda deaf sometimes, and we managed to have a great conversation!). \n\nHowever, the kitchen looked disorganized: Boxes and boxes of I don't know what, stacked 5 high on top of this seemingly 2-story shelf behind the chef's counter, bottles of wine and mezcal on the shelves, mixed with huge jars of pimenton, Asturian beans, and other kitchen staples; behind that, the prep area, with bulk bins, unattended food being prepped (persimmons, peels, etc.) and various supplies. I'm already paying $38 for 8 slices of Iberico pork shoulder. Why do I have to look at this disconnected, disorganized shit? I'm big on details, and they totally missed this one.\n\nAll in all, if you haven't been, definitely go and check it out, whether you like Chiarello or not. I long for the days when the Bay Area can have true tapas bars that are casual, where one can linger with great drinks and nice tapas to nibble on, instead of the bougie \"tapas restaurants\" we're currently stuck with.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Pluma (Grilled Pork with Honey) =\n", "Nicely grilled, but definitely under-seasoned without the honey.

Just to be clear, I'm more than happy to pay $150+ a person for a Spanish tapas restaurant, but there has to be a reason why a dish is so expensive -- a Celebrity chef shouldn't automatically skyrocket the price of 8 slices of grilled pork to $38. The pork should taste like it's $38, or maybe at least $30 with an $8 \"Celebrity chef\" tax. \n\nHonestly, though, as long as you know that you will be overpaying and you are content with knowing that you will be overpaying, Coqueta really is a solid Spanish restaurant in SF. There are many millionaires in SF who use $100 bills like Charmin Ultra sheets, so there will definitely be people who don't care, and for those people, Coqueta is great.\n\n----------------\nFOOD:\n\nPluma (Grilled Pork with Honey) =\nNicely grilled, but definitely under-seasoned without the honey. The honey gives the pork a wonderful, subtle sweetness, but the pork itself just isn't worth $38 for 8 slices. I don't care if there was an incredible scientific breakthrough that managed to reincarnate Julia Child and zombie Julia Child cooked up this meal for me, no celebrity chef should be charging this much for 8 pieces of bland pork that has to be drenched with honey.\n\nSerrano Ham w/ Manchego Cheese Pintxo =\nGood ham, good cheese -- the bite was the size of a tic tac, but it was a satisfying bite.\n\nEnglish Pea Croquettes =\nDelicious chicken pot pie croquettes -- nicely fried with a strong, creamy flavor.\n\nPaella =\nVery good paella -- excellent texture of the rice, subtly spiced, and with lots of crispy rice to give it a great overall consistency. Goes amazingly well with the peppers and aioli they give you on the side.\n\nGrilled Octopus =\nThe octopus was a bit too mushy, and not tender like how grilled octopus is supposed to be. The fingerling potatoes were tasteless -- I think this dish would go better with a puree or at least something with a bit more flavor.\n\nFig Tart with Blue Cheese Ice Cream =\nFig tart was just okay -- tasted like a stale pop tart. BUT the Blue Cheese Ice Cream was INCREDIBLE. Honestly, we spent about 10 minutes contemplating if we should try the Blue Cheese Ice Cream, because it sounded horrific but it definitely piqued our curiosity. Best decision of the night. Subtle blue cheese flavor, but the perfect amount of sweetness that ended with a satisfying end. This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors ever and I wish the fig tart wasn't there in the way.\n\nChurros =\nPerfectly fried churros. The chocolate sauce wasn't strong enough to do anything of substance, but the churros themselves were excellent. Again -- not sure if it's worth the $8 price tag, though.\n----------------\n\nCoqueta is an excellent addition to the Embarcadero and it definitely has its spectacular moments (Blue Cheese Ice Cream, Paella) but I was just expecting more, given the prices and the hype.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I can't get enough of their honey chile glaze on their Pluma (pork shoulder dish).

Our waterfront is home to a jewel of a ball park, the new Exploratorium, a state of the art cruise terminal, and the excitement of the America's Cup. And now, without much fanfare, a very special restaurant has landed in our neighborhood: Michael Chiarello's, Coqueta. \n\nChef Michael comes to San Francisco on the heels of his successful wine country restaurant, Bottega, which was awarded a place on the Chronicle list of top 100 restaurants in its first year of operation. This was only the most recent of Chef Michael's accolades. Shortly after graduating from the Culinary Institute in New York, after opening a restaurant in Miami, he was named Chef of the Year by Food and Wine Magazine. Ten years later the Culinary Institute of America awarded him the same honor. The chef has ventured into television on PBS and The Food Network, his shows garnering three straight Emmy awards. He also writes cookbooks. Perusing one, I learned more about cooking in the first 20 pages than I have ever learned from a cookbook.  Reading it, I became aware of the chefs philosophy of cooking: \"Food should tell a story with a sense of taste and place.\"\n\nBut at this time in his life Chef Michael has come back to his first love:  running a restaurant.  He is doing it by covering all the bases. He owns a sustainable 20 acre farm in the wine country which supplies much of the produce needed at his ventures.  Referring to Coqueta, he told me, \"Spanish Cuisine is more challenging than my Italian cuisine at Bottega, as I have been more careful about keeping to true tradition.\" Though,\" he admits, \"I have added some vegetables for Californians, as you have to practically beg for a vegetable in Spain.\" \n\nThe restaurant is divided into two sections.  Michael acquired the small building next to Pier 5, a dilapidated awninged structure, and turned it into a glass-enclosed room with views of the Bay and The Embarcadero. The room houses Coqueta's bar as well as space for casual dining. The main dining room, entered through this area, is located in the bulkhead building itself and features a seating bar where one can watch the goings on in the kitchen.\n\nThe menu is uncomplicated but intense. The first option is one of the beautifully presented sliced, in-house cured meat and Iberian cheese plates. Although we didn't try one of these platters, on a next trip, we will go with friends and order the large, El Plat Cap that comes with olive oil tortas and pan de cristal con tomate, the only bread Coqueta serves (the chef explained that bread is not traditionally served in Spain). This bread is made locally by Panorama Bakery for Coqueta. The only other bakery making it is in Barcelona. \n\nChef Michael has an innovative winner in his \"minis\". These one bite offerings are ordered or taken from a beautiful board, passed around by a server. Of the five offered, I found the Chorizo, roasted artichoke and piquillo peppers delectable, with the artichoke and peppers providing a creamy, rich texture that buffered the chewy but tender chorizo. Another favorite was the Quail egg Diablo. The delicate tiny egg paired beautifully with the pickled mustard seed and small piece of Serrano ham. \n\nKeeping with tradition, the restaurant serves both hot and cold tapas.  Of the cold tapas, two really stand out. Hands down the restaurant's most winning dish is Ensalada resorte.  The preparation comes in a glass with a vibrant and silky English green pea emulsion at the bottom layered with spring vegetables, sieved egg and Serrano ham croutons.  Another favorite, the Delta asparagus, is both beautiful and flavorful. The large stalks are trimmed back to the delicate white and are poached in olive oil, topped with grated smoky Idiazabal firm goat cheese and Serrano ham bits and accompanied by piquillo pepper aioli. \n\nOf the hot tapas, the wood grilled octopus is scrumptious. It is fired on the grill, with the body firm but tender, the tentacles crispy. This dish is served with roasted fingerling potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and dusted with pimento powder.  Another standout: the Sunny side-up egg dish, with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing. As Chef Michael says, \"I've always believed anything goes for breakfast, so breakfast should go at anytime, too.\" I believe him. \n\nAmong the entr\u00e9es, the winner is the mouth-watering Pluma, a pork shoulder loin imported from Spain especially for Chef Michael. This is the most expensive dish on the menu but easily shared, which makes it the least expensive of the entrees. The preparation time is 30 minutes but the time goes by quickly when you are eating tapas. This tender loin, easily cut with your fork, has a honey-chili glaze. \n\nWe have a super star chef and a super star restaurant at a super star location.

Dress code is casual - walking in in jeans and sneakers is no problem, but dressing up for fun is fine too.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful in guiding us on what to order, how much for our group, etc.  We did get a pitcher of sangria and a pitcher of sherry mojito - light, fruity, and refreshing - our group is not much for drinking, but everyone enjoyed it.\n\nIt seemed like almost everything we ordered was really delicious - the sunny-side up huevos with shrimp, the chicken and pea croquettes, the grilled octopus were our favorite tapas and a must-try. The kale salad and chard - were just OK. The uni open faced sandwich was good too  - but when considering how expensive it was it was two tiny circles of toast with uni and proscitto, just a bit bigger than a bagel bite, I don't think I would order that one again! We ordered two plates of each tapa so our group of 8 could try everything. Our main entrees were the 1) ribeye - so juicy and amazing, they bring out the ginormous gorgeous meat before cutting it so we can see it in it's full glory, a showstopper entree, 2) the pork pluma with honey-chili glaze - my favorite but the bigger pieces were just too rare for me and we sent half of it back to be seared which they did with a smile (thankful the waitstaff was down to earth and did not try to shame us for not digging extra rare pork - no matter what the pig's pedigree), and 3) the paella  - beautiful but at that point we were all stuffed and don't think we could really appreciate how good it was.\n\nFor dessert we got the churros and flan. Maybe I am crazy but I liked the flan more! I just don't know if these fancy churros with chocolate dipping sauce are really better than Disneyland churros...It was good - but again, may not have been able to really appreciate it since I was so stuffed.\n\nIn short - amazing food, beautiful restaurant, and a perfect place to celebrate with friends.

And with my constant eating out and never ending search for the best and most unique dining experiences, #trustme that says a lot.\n\nWe had dinner reservations for two and were seated by the hostess in the crowded outdoor bar/patio area amongst a combination of waiting, walk-in, and reservation customers.  Our table was a communal piece which is shared with about a dozen others.  Right away I knew that our dinner would not be pleasant due to other crowding customers who constantly placed their drinks in our area.  IMHO the the bar/patio area is not suitable for customers with reservations and instead should be used strictly for walk-ins and waiting customers.  I requested with our host that we be moved to the main area but was told that it was not possible as \"those tables are also reserved.\"  This statement clearly made me feel like a 2nd rate diner as I was never given the option of choosing between the bar and the main room when making our reservation.   In fact, I feel we were regulated to the bar area based on our lack of \"star power\" or political eliteness.  Among our hundreds of fine dining experiences (which includes several Michelin Star restaurants), my wife and I have never been made to feel like this, especially with proper reservations.  However, based on my Coqueta experience and after reading other negative reviews on this newly opened celebrity restaurant, it is clear to me that Chef Chiarello is more concerned with entertaining celebrities and the SF political elite than operating a restaurant of fine dining quality (during our visit, we personally observed Chef Chiarello greet and take a few pics with some main room diners including Tour de France announcer Bob Roll.  My wife and I were standing near the exit as he walked out, and he didn't even bother to look our way).\n\nThe food itself was good but not absolutely great.  The best dish (out of the seven tapas we ordered) was between the Ibirico Secreto Pork or the honey-glazed Pluma pork shoulder.  And the wood grilled octopus???  We had better at a pizza joint in Philly (see Osteria).\n\nThe single highlight of the night was our friendly waitress Christin.  Based on the tools (or lack of) provided by her management, I believe she went above and beyond her duty to see that our experience was tolerable.

I grew up in Spain, M\u00e1laga to be exact. Spanish food is in my veins. I know it inside and out. I know what is customarily served in restaurants and HOW and what is must taste like.\n\nThis place? This place does NOT serve Spanish food! If ever I were to bring a fellow Spaniard to this place they would never speak to me again, insulted beyond what words can convey that I would be stupid enough to even so much as suggest that the abominations served there are Spanish food. It was THAT bad. Horrible. Bad, Disgusting. Nasty. So, SO nasty!\n\nThe portions were insanely tiny. ALL the above overpriced food together would constitute one full dinner plate's worth of food. The manchego cheese was a mere few cubes of cheese (who on earth serves Manchego in cubes?!?!?!?) with some tiny slivers of dried, pita-like bread. The patatas bravas? Meh. The pulpo, my husband informed me (and I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian) was tasteless and bland and just bad. So, SO bad. The esp\u00e1rragos, br\u00f3coli, verduras a la catalana and setas all ajillo all might as well have been the same dish. Taste? Burned. Bitter. Crunchy because it was THAT burned. Charred. Disgusting. Overly chewy. Bad. So, SO bad. Did I say disgusting? Bitter? Burned? Charred? And bad? So, SO bad? Because it bears repeating it was THAT bad!\n\nA typical Spanish restaurant will serve a nice slab of sliced French bread with butter or olive oil as something to munch on until the appetizers and the food arrive but there was no bread to be had. The patatas chips (or just plain ol' chips with some manchego on top) are NOT a Spanish dish served at restaurants! Believe it or not, we buy chips and eat them out of bags there too and don't pretend to grab some cheap ass chips, sprinkle manchego on them and call it a dish! But it was the closest thing to anything appetizing for the kids to eat and, in all honesty, was probably the ONLY thing that did not make us want to smash our heads up against a wall because THAT would be more delightful than having to take one more bite of the atrocious, charred, bitter and plain disgusting food served at Coqueta.\n\nIn the almost twenty years I have lived here in San Francisco, this is by far THE worse dining experience we have EVER had EVER, ANYWHERE! And that is baaaaad if you factor in the fact that I am well traveled and have lived abroad, in different countries for many years and, Coqueta? Worst food I have ever had ANYWHERE globally speaking. \n\nEVER.\n\nANYWHERE\n\nBecause, again, it bears repeating in case you didn't quite get it.\n\nAnd all those teeny tiny portions that barely made up one full dinner plate's worth of food? $90. Robbery if you ask me. If you are on the fence about this place, don't be any more. It is pretentious, and plain baaaad. So, SO bad.

I am a sucker for tapas because it lets me really delve into a menu. That and all the cheese. I LOVE cheese. My experience started with a brief wait at the hostess stand. I was fortunate enough to catch an early BART train, but it meant I was a 1/2 hour early for the reservation. I was expecting to cool my heels in a very crowded bar. Instead, they seated me right away. As soon as I was situated, my server brought me water and asked if I wanted a drink while I waited. I have looked over the menu on line and was delighted to see it was current. I ordered the Sutter Smash which had caught my eye. Knowing I was alone for the moment, my server kept checking in with me. One of the things she asked was if there were any food restriction or allergies. I told here I didn't have any but that my friend was vegetarian. She promised to mark up a menu for her that highlighted t dishes that were already vegetarian or could easily be made so. When she delivered my cocktail, my waitress asked if I wanted to order a meat dish before my dinner companion arrived. Normally, I would wait, but sometimes I feel guilty eating meat with my veggies friends. The server recommended the chicken croquettes, which would be quick and (of course) delicious. I did, and they were. They were three, two bite bits of cheesy, fried,  chicken deliciousness that were served with slices of orange and slivers of pepper. Yum! Shortly after polishing them off my dish was whisked away and my friend arrived. Just based on that part of my experience, I would say that the service is worth 5 stars. The excellent service continued though out the dinner. Water was poured, new dishes were brought out (great pacing) and empty dishes were whisked away to make room.  Everything we tried (please check out the photos) was delicious. My only real disappointment was the asparagus dish (not sure of the official name).  The Romesco sauce and Manchego that were part of the dish were delicious. The micro greens and the vegetable itself were just OK. The Bikini (brioche a la plancha with ca\u00f1a de cabra, roasted eggplant and Quince Jalea) and Pan con tomate were both particularly good, I think in part because the bread was so wonderful. The dessert was good, but not amazing. I think that and the asparagus are why I can't give 5 stars. If I could I would lean to 4.25 or 4.5. I really wish I had tried the Gambas Negras and Setas al ajillo (sherry laced mushrooms). Both of those are tapas staples for me, but it would have been way too much food. Maybe next time. I also want to try the paella. I typically either go straight for that or have tapas, not both.

And it HURT.\n\nI will say, you are paying for quality, service, and ambiance.\nThe interior decor is well thought out and everything is beautiful. Manly. Leather. Brown. Fancy mancave vibes. (Sorry that doesn't sound articulate, lol.. then again, I started my review with: HELLA FANCE. So there goes that.)\n\nThe only thing to note is that it's very loud in here. I don't know what it is with the acoustics but I felt like I was straining to hear my friend across the table from me.\n\nAnyway, on to the food and drinks.\n\nCocktails start at about $14, typical of the area. High quality ingredients and beautifully garnished. I got the Barca Gintonic and my friend got the Sutter Splash. Both were very well balanced and it was worth the price tag.\n\nFOOD.\n\nHUEVOS NACIONAL $7 - 3 STARS - $7 for one whole egg? It's only two halves. $3.5 per bite. Even ignoring the price tag, I didn't feel like it was all that great?!?!? Maybe I'm just not a fan of deviled eggs, and PAYING that much for a deviled egg. The flavors were very complex with the bonito and the pickled saffron potato. I appreciated the complexity, but I was still sad that it cost seven freakin' dollars and it didn't rock my socks off.\n\nABONDIGAS, $14 - 4.5 STARS - 3 small meatballs. But, very rich. I cut my meatball into 4 pieces because it was that rich! This is something you want to savor and eat slow. Very rich in duck flavor, extremely soft & tender. Borderline almost falling apart even when moving it over to my plate! The cherry salsa and shallots on top were a perfect complement.\n\nPLUMA, $38 - 3.5 STARS - Everyone RAVED about this, so I ordered it.. and yeah... it was good pork and very tender. BUT IT WAS ALSO ONLY LIKE 8 PIECES. I don't mean to compare with House of Prime Rib.. but it's $50 over there, for a full slab of meat, plus a second slice, AND sides, soo..... it was hard for me to justify this. The honey chili glaze was interesting, but I would have preferred a more savory/heavy sauce. Tasted a bit bland on its own but i guess they wanted the meat to speak for itself.\n\nSETAS AL AJILLO (mushrooms), $10 - 5 STARS - SHIZ. Now these, I can justify paying more for. Perfectly roasted, extremely garlicky, and not too soft. I ate these with the pork shoulder and it made it 100% better, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nOverall, I put down $125 after tax and tip for a satisfying meal.. 2x higher than I'd like but I guess I can check this place off the list since I had been curious about it for a while now.\nDon't think I would return unless a friend picked this place and it was for an occasion!", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-03-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I came here yesterday for a team lunch and we tried all the pintxos, pan con tomate, croquetas de pollo, pulpo a la parilla, setas al ajillo, albondigas a la feria, \npatatas bravas, pluma.

BE. YOND!\n\nWe went to Coqueta for lunch today, we being myself, my husband and our teenage kids. We ordered a solid number of dishes:\n\n1- Patatas chips\n2- Esp\u00e1rragos con salsa romesc\u00fa\n3- Brocoli con salsa romesc\u00fa\n4- Verduras a la catalana\n5- Pulpo \n6- Setas al ajillo\n7- Queso Manchego\n8- Patatas bravas\n\nA fact that must be known before I delve in. I grew up in Spain, M\u00e1laga to be exact. Spanish food is in my veins. I know it inside and out. I know what is customarily served in restaurants and HOW and what is must taste like.\n\nThis place? This place does NOT serve Spanish food! If ever I were to bring a fellow Spaniard to this place they would never speak to me again, insulted beyond what words can convey that I would be stupid enough to even so much as suggest that the abominations served there are Spanish food. It was THAT bad. Horrible. Bad, Disgusting. Nasty. So, SO nasty!\n\nThe portions were insanely tiny. ALL the above overpriced food together would constitute one full dinner plate's worth of food. The manchego cheese was a mere few cubes of cheese (who on earth serves Manchego in cubes?!?!?!?) with some tiny slivers of dried, pita-like bread. The patatas bravas? Meh. The pulpo, my husband informed me (and I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian) was tasteless and bland and just bad. So, SO bad. The esp\u00e1rragos, br\u00f3coli, verduras a la catalana and setas all ajillo all might as well have been the same dish. Taste? Burned. Bitter. Crunchy because it was THAT burned. Charred. Disgusting. Overly chewy. Bad. So, SO bad. Did I say disgusting? Bitter? Burned? Charred? And bad? So, SO bad? Because it bears repeating it was THAT bad!\n\nA typical Spanish restaurant will serve a nice slab of sliced French bread with butter or olive oil as something to munch on until the appetizers and the food arrive but there was no bread to be had. The patatas chips (or just plain ol' chips with some manchego on top) are NOT a Spanish dish served at restaurants! Believe it or not, we buy chips and eat them out of bags there too and don't pretend to grab some cheap ass chips, sprinkle manchego on them and call it a dish! But it was the closest thing to anything appetizing for the kids to eat and, in all honesty, was probably the ONLY thing that did not make us want to smash our heads up against a wall because THAT would be more delightful than having to take one more bite of the atrocious, charred, bitter and plain disgusting food served at Coqueta.\n\nIn the almost twenty years I have lived here in San Francisco, this is by far THE worse dining experience we have EVER had EVER, ANYWHERE! And that is baaaaad if you factor in the fact that I am well traveled and have lived abroad, in different countries for many years and, Coqueta? Worst food I have ever had ANYWHERE globally speaking. \n\nEVER.\n\nANYWHERE\n\nBecause, again, it bears repeating in case you didn't quite get it.\n\nAnd all those teeny tiny portions that barely made up one full dinner plate's worth of food? $90. Robbery if you ask me. If you are on the fence about this place, don't be any more. It is pretentious, and plain baaaad. So, SO bad. Never the f*** again!\n\nAnd PS- We are still hungry but have been left with the bonus of stomach cramps and spending most of our Sunday running to the bathroom in sheer agony!

Lately, we've been having Spanish/tapas style food and it just so happens that Coqueta was also one of those restaurants. Anyways, we booked reservations about two weeks in advance for a lovely Saturday lunch. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately at one of the corner booths. The 4 of us each got our own drinks and shared these 8 dishes:\n\nBarca Gintonic: A really beautiful drink. I'm actually not a big fan of gin in general because of its taste, but after having Coqueta's, I really liked it. It was very refreshing with a bit of a floral/fruity taste. A bit expensive for a drink though.\n\nChorizo: Just OK. The chorizo came as bite-size skewers with roasted artichokes and piquillo pepper. For the portion size, it was quite expensive and not worth it. Least impressive dish. \n\nSunny side-up egg with Shrimp and Crispy Potato: YUM. One of my favorite dishes even though it was a bit oily... The server would burst the egg yolk and mix it with the shrimp and crispy potatoes. The potatoes were really crispy, so when you eat all three together in a mixture, it had the perfect crunch to it. Nice texture to it. I think this dish would be perfect for brunch. \n\nWhole Monterey Calamari on the Plancha: Not your normal crispy calamari. Really liked the squid ink alioli with the calamari. Calamari was fresh and chewy. \n\nPaella: I have had paella at several other restaurants before. Honestly, it was just OK. The paella came with root vegetables, chorizo, prawns, clams, and lemon alioli. The lemon alioli paired well with the paella. Otherwise, nothing really stood out. Some of the seafood tasted a bit too fishy for me. :/\n\nPluma (Pork Shoulder Loin): Just OK... It was pretty tender, but nothing too special. It was already flavorful enough without having to pair it with the honey-chili glaze.\n\nSetas al ajillo: My other favorite dish of the night! Loved the flavors to the mushrooms. I felt healthy just eating it. It wasn't too heavy nor too oily. \n\nGrilled Albondigas: Duck and pork meatballs. At first bite, the texture was a bit weird for me.. It was a bit mushy, yet bursted with flavor... but past that, it was really delicious. A bit heavy, hearty, yet juicy.\n\nChurros with drinking hot chocolate and mixed berry powder: Dip the churro first into the mixed berry powder and then into the hot chocolate. It tasted very yummy! I really liked the combination of the two. A good way to end a delicious meal.\n\nWhat really bugged me was that there were quite a few flies at our table. Every time we tried to eat or drink, there was always at least one buzzing around. It was quite annoying.. :( Anyways, service was excellent. Our water cups were always refilled and our plates were changed each time we got a new dish. The overall meal was quite expensive as it added up. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food and I would say that Coqueta is one of the better restaurants for tapas style/Spanish food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-04-29"}, {"excerpts": ["SETAS AL AJILLO:  ", "Wild mushrooms with a hint of chili.

Our reservation was on Saturday at 5:30 and we were able to find street parking nearby.  Since the meters were only required until 6pm, we only had to pay $1.50 for half an hour on the meter.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\nSUNNY SIDE-UP HUEVO:  Very good.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  It was like really thin shoestring potatoes with a few shrimp and a sunny side-up egg on top.  Our waitress came and mixed it all up for us.\n\nCROQUETA DE POLLO:  This comes with 3 pieces, but the waitress recommended that we add one more.  Looked like tater tots, with a crunchy outside and tender inside.   It was very tasty.\n\nPANTATAS BRAVAS:  Not too special.  Tasted just like plain thumb-size potatoes.    The sauce had little taste.\n\nCALAMARES A LA PLANCHA:  Four small squid with a dab of squid ink.  This was just ok, nothing special.\n\nSETAS AL AJILLO:  Wild mushrooms with a hint of chili.  This was pretty good.\n\nESPARRAGOS TRIGEROS CON ROMESCO:  Not sure what the green was, but it tasted like spinach.  Loved it!  \n\nPAELLA:  We ordered this as soon as we got there because it takes 30-40 minutes to prepare.  This was the last dish that they brought out and it was a good size serving.  The four of us couldn't finish it.  It was average.\n\nLIMONADA:  This was sooo good.  Lemonade with a couple of blueberries inside and a rosemary twig.\n\nThe portions are really small.  For four of us, we only got like a couple of bites from each dish, except for the Paella.\n\nFor Dessert, we shared the Churros.  There were 4 small pieces served with \"drinking chocolate\" and berry powder.  We dipped the churros in the chocolate and then dipped it in the powder.  The combination tasted like a cherry filled donut.\n\nThe staff were really friendly and did a great job explaining the dishes to us.  They refilled our water constantly.

It was accompanied by a watermelon and onion salad which was the best part of the dish.\n\n*Pulpo a la Parilla Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling\npotatos,piment\u00f3n olive oil $14  was my husband's favorite dish.  Great grilled flavor but almost too tender.  Very much like Kokkari's which we had last week.\n\nCalamares a la Plancha Whole Monterey calamari on the\nplancha with onion jam and squid ink alioli $10.  3 whole calamari whose taste was delicate, a bit oily but enjoyable.\n\nOur last dish was the Pluma Acorn fed, Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota\npork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze $38.  Well................ yes it was fatty, moist and tasty but the serving is really, really small.  Did it knock our socks off?  NO!

Coqueta had been on the list a long time. I am a sucker for tapas because it lets me really delve into a menu. That and all the cheese. I LOVE cheese. My experience started with a brief wait at the hostess stand. I was fortunate enough to catch an early BART train, but it meant I was a 1/2 hour early for the reservation. I was expecting to cool my heels in a very crowded bar. Instead, they seated me right away. As soon as I was situated, my server brought me water and asked if I wanted a drink while I waited. I have looked over the menu on line and was delighted to see it was current. I ordered the Sutter Smash which had caught my eye. Knowing I was alone for the moment, my server kept checking in with me. One of the things she asked was if there were any food restriction or allergies. I told here I didn't have any but that my friend was vegetarian. She promised to mark up a menu for her that highlighted t dishes that were already vegetarian or could easily be made so. When she delivered my cocktail, my waitress asked if I wanted to order a meat dish before my dinner companion arrived. Normally, I would wait, but sometimes I feel guilty eating meat with my veggies friends. The server recommended the chicken croquettes, which would be quick and (of course) delicious. I did, and they were. They were three, two bite bits of cheesy, fried,  chicken deliciousness that were served with slices of orange and slivers of pepper. Yum! Shortly after polishing them off my dish was whisked away and my friend arrived. Just based on that part of my experience, I would say that the service is worth 5 stars. The excellent service continued though out the dinner. Water was poured, new dishes were brought out (great pacing) and empty dishes were whisked away to make room.  Everything we tried (please check out the photos) was delicious. My only real disappointment was the asparagus dish (not sure of the official name).  The Romesco sauce and Manchego that were part of the dish were delicious. The micro greens and the vegetable itself were just OK. The Bikini (brioche a la plancha with ca\u00f1a de cabra, roasted eggplant and Quince Jalea) and Pan con tomate were both particularly good, I think in part because the bread was so wonderful. The dessert was good, but not amazing. I think that and the asparagus are why I can't give 5 stars. If I could I would lean to 4.25 or 4.5. I really wish I had tried the Gambas Negras and Setas al ajillo (sherry laced mushrooms). Both of those are tapas staples for me, but it would have been way too much food. Maybe next time.

It was the best place to celebrate my milestone birthday, and could not have asked for better food, service, and ambiance. \n\nFirst off, always make reservations here! Thankfully, my girls did so a few weeks to a month in advance to secure a prime Saturday evening reservation. It was a perfect SF evening, and the views were spectacular since it was a clear and fogless night. The interior is sexy and inviting, but not pretentious. Our table had a view of the kitchen, and they were hustling. Hillary, our amazing server, was outstanding as she's friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and wish ever server could be like her! Fabulous drink menu, from mezcal to gins, and they are just so pretty! (see pics). They even surprised me with a take on my favorite Moscow Mule. Later on, we also ordered a pitcher of white sangria. Sweet, fruity liquid gold!\n\nOk, here's what we ordered:\nEl Plat Cap - chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses. Si si!\nPatatas bravas - spanish staple, and is excellent! Definite must order. \nCroquetas - another spanish staple, and a must order. Fried perfection.\nAlbondigas a la feria - duck and pork meatballs. Absolutely delish and flavorful.\nSunny side up huevo - ordered two of these because it was a favorite of everyone. The flavors and the textures of the egg, shrimp, crispy potato! OH MYLANTA!\nPaella - YES! Must order! Of course, it took about 30-40 minutes, but we had enough drinks and tapas to keep us busy. \n\nAnd for the finale, the gals surprised me again with a ginormous dessert platter. It's basically everything on their dessert menu served on this wooden board that's longer than our server Hillary's arm. The churros were my favorite.\n\nMany thanks to my galpals, Hillary and staff at Coqueta. It was a memorable birthday celebration, and cannot wait to return. \n\nPS There are only 2 bathrooms and are actually both unisex. \nPSS Pay attention to the small plates as they are all Spanish themed and made locally by an Oakland artist.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-11-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the grilled octopus , paella , jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, patatas bravas amazing.

That's when!\"\n\n~3 years ago, the [charming] Italian Food Network personality opened this Spanish tapas restaurant on the Embarcadero waterfront. They serve many Spanish staples, including Spanish cured meats and cheeses, pintxos, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella. Trust a renowned chef like Michael Chiarello to wonderfully elevate Spanish flavors with his own delicious flare.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing here: PLUMA, which is a honey-chili glazed, acorn-fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin (aka the creme de la creme of Spanish piggies). It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish. I'm even obsessed with the bottle of extra HONEY-CHILI GLAZE that it's served with. It is really so fantastic that if I could I would regularly pair it with the many, many steaks that I eat.\n\nThe pulpo a la parilla is also worth ordering, as it's executed just as perfectly as the wood-grilled octopus at Bottega (aka my favorite octopus) with the additional pleasure of that pimenton oil. Yum!\n\nPutting my fangirl enthusiasm aside, Coqueta is good but not good enough to be on my regular rotation of Spanish restaurants. For one, it's a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're not in a big group and want to sample everything (or on a date, for instance). Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest. The Barca gintonic is arguably the best gin & tonic in the city. It's such a beautiful drink with vibrant flavors to match. I was also pleasantly surprised that you can order a porron of wine, which is SUCH a Spanish novelty. I have a porron from Spanish relatives just collecting dust at my house, but seeing it at Coqueta makes me want to bring back the joy of spilling wine everywhere.\n\nOther notes:\n-Open late\n-Front area is nice for hanging out but can get really competitive for space\n-Olives are from the Chiarello Vineyards, not Spain", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Paella - 2.5 stars: Seafood didn't tasty very fresh, paella kinda mushy\n"], "author": "Jess C.", "review": "LOVE Coquetta - pricey but beautiful ambiance, delicious food, and great for groups.\n\n* Pork Shoulder - 5 stars: Incredibleeeee.\n* Steak - 4 stars: So tender and perfectly cooked.

However, we just couldn't resist when we were in San Francisco. We took the opportunity to dine at Top Chef Master Michael Chiarello's restaurant and for the most part walked out very pleased. I highly recommend making a reservation. We arrived earlier than our reservation time hoping we could sit earlier (our reservation was around 9pm) and we barely sat earlier. However, service was excellent all throughout our meal which was a huge plus. We ordered the following things:\n\nSalm\u00f3n Ahumado (Smoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey): This was the first thing we ate and probably my favorite bite of the night. It wasn't the first time that I've had smoked salmon on toast but this was a masterpiece. Perfectly soft and seasoned just right.The truffle honey added such depth and a pleasant taste that we instantly wished that we had just ordered a bunch more of this to eat. \n\nPan con Tomate (Cristal bread, tomate confitura, house Cured Jam\u00f3n Serrano): It was basically bread with this tomato jelly. I've never had tomato jelly quite like this and it was tasty! Different. My husband didn't really care for it too much though and found the cured jam\u00f3n serrano way too salty. I agreed that this whole dish was just a tad on the salty side but I still found the dish enjoyable. \n\nSunny side-up Huevo With Shrimp (crispy potato, chorizo dressing): Shrimp and eggs! This looked delicious but once our server mixed everything together for us, it became very clear that the dish was just drowning in oil. It was so heavy and there was nothing to cut through that greasy tasty and honestly it was very unpleasant. We did not want to finish this and had to drink a lot of wine to get rid of that oily coating inside our mouth. \n\nPaella ( bomba rice, jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo with thumbelina carrots, pickled garlic scapes, lemon alioli): Paella is honestly one of my favorite foods in the whole world. With that said, Coqueta did not have the best paella. Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty. But I found the rice to be slightly under and that crispy bottom that makes a good paella was a little too burnt. However, I absolutely enjoyed the large shrimps that came with this dish and it was definitely a good portion for us to share. \n\nBizcocho de Arroz con Leche Salvador Dal\u00ed (warm molton arroz con leche cake, huckleberries, arroz con leche ice cream): This was such a pleasant surprise! I've never liked rice in my dessert but we ordered this because my husband likes sweetened rice. This dessert was absolutely delicious. The cake wasn't all that sweet but it was the perfect accompaniment to their rice ice cream. Unique and fantastic. I would order this again and again!\n\nTrio de Pintxos (salted caramel with pimenton, blood orange gelatina with bergamot black tea sugar, olives dulces with chocolate glaze): Everything was made in house which was pretty impressive. I really appreciated the fact that Coqueta opened me up to different flavor combinations. This was a nice way to taste a variety of gourmet candy and it was really fun to try something new. We especially enjoyed the salted caramel with pimenton. \n\nManchego Cheesecake (with caramel popcorn): This was just a small bite and it was a good finish to our meal. We enjoyed the texture, and the caramel popcorn that provided the right bite to the creamy cheesecake. It was good but I think it's perfect as a small bite. I don't think I could eat a whole slice because it was very sweet and very rich. \n\nOverall, this was a solid Spanish tapas restaurant. We walked out and a little buzzed from the bottle of wine we had. Of course we paid more than we would ideally like but we were on vacation and it was worth the splurge for us.

Our reservation was for 8 and only 2 of us get to the restaurant on time. But the restaurant was nice enough to seated us instead of crossing off our reservation. \n\nAs we walked into the restaurant, we were not quite impressed by the decor and the environment. Because it was just not that special. But as we were seated, the waiter came right up to us (Even just 2 out of 8 people) he started to explained the menu and the drink to us. We were quite surprised and felt welcomed. As our group continued to walk into the door, we started to have a full table. Then the waiter explained the entire menu again to us. But guess what!!?? 8 people deciding what to order for tapas were not an easy thing to do. So we gave the waiter the full power to constructed the dinner menu for us. If I recalled correctly, we have about 12 course meals for that night.\n\n1. We had 2 plates of Cheese plates with some meat (Sorry I cannot name the cheese and the meat, because i forgot what was the names LOL).\n     There are 3 different types of cheese (Blue, Smoked Cheddar, and goat cheese?). I loved all 3 of these cheeses, but the blue cheese was too strong for me. The cheese itself have a really strong aroma the just spread through your entire palate. The strong creamy texture goes really well with the cracker provided with the cheese plate. Overall it kind of give you a mouth-gasm if you love cheese! As for the meat, I believed there are porchetta and 2 other types of meat that I don't remember. The meats were great, but not as memorable when compared to the Cheese. But if you LOVE CHEESE. Give the cheese plate a shot! \n\n2. Razor Clams & Chicken pot pie roll and grape fruit & Egg, Shrimp, Meat, fried potato thingy (Sorry I just don't remember what it called), Meatball\n     a. The razor clams was simply served with sea salt and half of a lemon. You sprinkle the salt by yourself and add the lemon juice by yourself as well. To be honest, i believed it will be better if the clams were about the same size. Overall, the taste was fresh but then it's not really a memorable dish. Could give it a shot or not.\n\n     b. It's basically a chicken pot pie inside a roll LOL... it was great but it's pretty much just a chicken pot pie inside the roll and that's pretty much it. The grape fruit slice was to help you to clean your palate.\n\n     c. You basically can only taste the meat under the egg and the flavor from the shrimp. Otherwise it wasn't quite memorable at all\n\n     d. The meat ball was only okay, it's really heavy and it's quite blend in my opinion. Wouldn't really recommend this dish to anyone.\n\n3. Shrimp & Bread\n     The grilled shrimps were fantastic! It's a bit spicy but the flavor was awesome. The plate looks a bit greasy, but you can't really feel the grease when you are eating this dish. The bread with the sauce on the plate was also a good combination!\n\n4. Steak\n     This is basically their \"MAIN Course\" The steak was tender and the seasoning was just right. The seasoned the steak with seasalt, but the salt was not overpowering the nature flavor of the steak! Overall, this is an amazing dish! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH\n\n5. Paella\n     This is a great disappointment in my opinion. Everything else are all flavorful and super good for your taste bud, but the Paella was a let down. The rice was not seasoned it was really blend and it was greasy. As you take a bite of the rice, it's super oily and heavy and I wouldn't really want to take a second bite. The shrimp was perfectly executed and the flavor was great. The clams were tiny but the taste was great as well. But the rice itself was a really big disappointment.... \n\n6. Grilled Octopus \n     This is another HIGHLY RECOMMENDED dish. It's small plate garnished with some potato. You will probably get 3 tentacles from this dish but the tentacles were pretty big. The seasoning was great and the octopus was not over cooked. It was not rubbery at all it was tender!! I'll highly rate this course. \n\n7. Dessert \n     The dessert was a small cheesecake wrapped by camel. If you don't like your dessert way too sweet. I wouldn't recommend this at all. But if you enjoy your dessert with lots of sugar! This is the plate to go. \n\nOverall, the experience was great! But Only the Steak and Octopus were the most memorable dishes. Not saying other dishes were bad, it was just not as memorable as these 2. If you want to try Paella (Spanish Rice with Seafood) I would not recommend this at all, since the rice was really blend and under seasoned. \n\nWe gave the waiter the power to construct our menu and it was a great experience.

This is a nice to have item.  The must have items are the octopus with fingerling potatoes and head-on prawns.  These were grilled and you could taste the smokey flavor.

I never actually hung out there before, but when I had dinner there with a few friends, I arrived early to try their famous Bar\u00e7a Gintonic.\n\nBar\u00e7a Gintonic -- http://bit.ly/1KzsPZL\nBloom London dry gin, Fever Tree tonic with grapefruit and pine.\nA very fragrant, refreshing cocktail that's visually appealing.  Okay it looks like a fish bowl, but still looks awesome.  I'd surely order this again.\n\nIt's also good to know that when you're at the bar, you can also order anything on the menu.  So you can enjoy a few small plates and pair it with some wine or a fancy cocktail.  I still think my favorite drink there is their Porron Kalimotxo that I had before.\n\nWhen it came to dinner time, even though I had been there before, we pretty let our waiter decide what to get on their menu for the most part.  And he hit it out of the park with all his selections.  Here are some of my favorite highlights from our dinner:\n\nGambas al Negro -- http://bit.ly/1FQNqHP\nOlive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce.\nNicely cooked prawns and the garlic flavor was pretty strong.\n\nSalmon Ahumado -- http://bit.ly/1Jlagdh\nSmoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey\nThese were like little fancy lox bagels.  The truffle honey really made them super rich and delicious.  I actually liked these better than their Mar y Montana, but they're not that far off.\n\nPluma -- http://bit.ly/1GTMAfF\nIberico de Belotta Pork Shoulder Loin with Honey Chili Glaze\nMy favorite item of the night.  I think out of all the things I wanted to try, this was my most anticipated.  The pork was so tender, moist, and flavorful, that it really didn't need the Honey Chili Glaze, but the glaze was a great sweet flavor enhancement when drizzled on.

The bagel bites that salmon was resting in was toasted to perfection, giving it a crunch to the softness of the salmon. The paella was admirable the chorizo was flavorful and had a small kick. The shrimp was heavenly. However it was burnt on the bottom which made it not as enjoyable as it could have been. The food overall the spectacular and I would definitely come back for the food. The drinks were amazing and very exotic. \n\nThe service was impeccable! They were quick to pick up our empty cups and dirty dishes and bring out our next round of food or drinks.

What's not to like about this place?\n\nLocated in the Pier 5 building, I expected this to be one of those overpriced, trendy tapas restaurants where the prime waterfront location would draw customers, more so than the food. But as attractive as the interior was with their eclectic mix of rustic and chic, the dishes that we ordered were well prepared and simply delicious.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n-Croquetas de pollo. Recommended by our server as the 'best croquetas you've ever had', the crispy chicharon crust paired with the smooth and creamy chicken and pea filling was savory and texturally perfect.\n \n-Setas al ajillo. A beautiful mix of wild and cultivated mushrooms coated lightly with sherry, garlic and chili. The flavors were mild but interesting and a sure hit for any mushroom lover.\n\n-Pulpo a la Parilla. A classic dish of wood-grilled octopus. Cooked perfectly to a nice bouncy texture,retaining a nice subtle smoky flavor. Presented simply to enjoy the flavor of the octopus. Excellent.\n\n-Albondigas a la Feria. These duck and pork meatballs were simply the best albondigas I've had. The sweetness of the duck paired with the saltiness of the pork created an absolutely addicting flavor.\n\n-Gambas al Negro. Perfectly cooked gulf prawns w/ garlic chili sauce. Head suckingly delicious. Easily the best dish of the day.\n\n-The Classic Paella. Well balanced and seasoned with shellfish broth and a good mix of seafood and jamon serrano. Not the best paella I've ever had, but certainly a solid version.\n\n-Churro 'Fantasia'. Crispy little churros with a side of drinking chocolate. How can this possibly be bad?\n\n -Manchego Cheescake bite w/ caramel popcorn. Our server gave us a couple of these on the house. The manchego keeps it from being too sweet. Nice way to finish a meal.\n\nI've rarely been to a tapas restaurant where each dish we ordered was so thoughtfully prepared and had me anxiously anticipating the next one. Maybe not every dish on their menu is a hit, but I was seriously impressed with each one that we ordered. And considering that you can easily rack up a hefty bill when enjoying some tapas and drinks, the consistency of quality was appreciated.

(and I soooo did!  it was so easy to make everything look great--check my pics out!)\n\n1. Sangria (White Win, Roasted Apples, Spices, House Recipe) 750ml Porron $36:  Despite the involved craft, the taste was not as complex as I was hoping.  It was of course good tasting as expected, but probably not as amazing as the description.  5/10.\n\n2. Salmon Ahumado $8:  Ha ha, so they called this an \"open face sandwich\" but seriously, just call it an hors d oeuvre!  Anyway, these will probably be some of the best smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres you've ever seen.  The honey makes it taste a lot more special.  7/10.\n\n3. Huevos Nacional $7:  Like many of the others, this is a masterfully re-envisioned version of a traditional dish.  Never had any deviled eggs like this!  Stuffed with spring peas and smoked pimenton alioli they say.  Very unique.  8/10.\n\n4. Patatas Bravas $8:  Hmmm, very interesting one here.  I would say this would kinda be like an ultra fancy version of tater tots, you know, if you used purple potatoes, smoked them, and made up a fancy dip.  You do taste the special taste of the fresh and fancy potatoes, but personally to me I'd go for a bit more kick.  Sauce is very slightly hot, but barely--could use a bit more heat.  The meat looks beautiful though!  7/10.\n\n5. Croquetas de Pollo $9:  Mmmmmm.... kinda reminds me of similar creations from Porto's in Glendale, but for 2x the price, ha ha.  Probably would fall in the \"comfort food\" category.  Tastes yummy though!  7/10.\n\n6. Albondigas a la Feria $14:  The most unique and complex meatballs I've ever had.  The meat is very soft and juicy on the inside, and though does resemble an Italian meatball, somehow manages to taste and feel totally different!  The outside flavor and sauce is quite strong and distinct.  I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.  Flavor was great though, but unlike the others maybe somewhat traditional.  The drinking chocolate was good but could use more spice.  The sour powder was badass though--great kick.  5/10.\n\nWorks of art to eat.  Wonderful service.

We opted for the Asturian apple pie with blue cheese ice cream, which was good, but paled in comparison when we were reminded of the Viennese apple strudel we had recently.\n\nA memorable meal and a place we absolutely would return to (sangria, poprocksicles and churros, I'm coming back for you!)", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Than of course, how could we not have their Paella?

I cannot rave enough about this place. It's hands down the best Spanish food I've ever had (though I've not been to Spain yet :-(  Incredibly polished, sophisticated meticulously cooked dishes. We don't drink but ordered the non-alcoholic lemonade, only because it had rosemary. Yes, that's what I said: 'rosemary' as in the fresh sprig of green + fresh blueberries. I'm not a huge beverage person, I mainly drink only water, but was intrigued by the description of rosemary. It lived up to the description, and was fantastic. The water, btw, is served in brass cups with steel insides, reminiscent of villages in Asia and Europe, and with the rustic yet polished cutlery, I had to take a photo. We started with the boquerones (anchovy), which so simple in theory, just a little skewer with green olive, pepper bit, and Spanish white anchovy--but an explosion of flavor, with the taste lingering. And then the Octopus with fingerling potatoes, smoky and charred, tons of textures and a rounded complexity on my tongue. I'm about to describe their kale salad, and I almost hesitate because there's just no way for me to do justice to it with words. When I initially told my husband that I wanted to order it, he demurred a bit, because after all, it's kale, right? Not to mention we have salad every single night. And I could see him thinking, \"Did we drive to S.F. to eat a heap of kale?\" But I said, \"Look at the menu description, it looks like there's a lot going on in it.\" So the salad arrives, and we both dig a fork into it. We unanimously declared it to be hands down the best kale salad we've ever eaten--and I pretty much force feed my husband salad year round, kale included--lacinato included. It's seems absurd to get this excited about kale but I kid you not: this was a revelation--with kumquats, and steamed garbanzo beans, a tangy earthy dressing, with tiny bits of flash fried kale \"chips\" as garnish . . . the flavors kept coming and coming, every forkful was somehow bold and different; normally I don't like sweetness in a dressing, and though this was technically \"sweet,\" it managed to have just a hint of sweet, a welcome mat for the palate, an introduction of sweet to the ensuing tang of kumquat and earthiness of garbanzo. It balanced out the salty of the dressing and the intrinsic bitterness of the kale leaves. It was bite after bite of the perfect mix of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty to make it more than the sum of each of these four parts. Yes, I know they call it umami--but let me go out on a limb and say it was more than this--this kale salad merits a place in the pantheon of flavors :-) I told my husband, \"Next time we come here, I'm gonna get a kale salad all to myself and build my entire meal around it.\" We got the deviled eggs, which as hackneyed as it sounds, it's worth ordering--a piquancy is different and unique, not your typical devil :-) Than of course, how could we not have their Paella? Stuffed full of humungous buttery prawns, clams, chorizo with a bite, tender spears of asparagus, snap peas that actually snapped with freshness, mustard florets . . . and heaven knows what else they managed to put in there, for a virtual symphony in skillet. The rice stuck to the edges, for that perfect charred bit where you must scrape it off and (if you don't give a crap about table manners, which I don't), lick fingers. It's a bit on the salty side, which I love and the lemon aioli  is the perfect finishing touch. My husband didn't go for the aioli and instead, loved the little peppers they gave with it. It's also gorgeous to look at, prompting me to take a photo. Do you think we had enough? Not! We had the manchego cheese bite size cheesecake with caramel popcorn and churros with drinking chocolate, which comes with a crushed intensely flavored berry powder--holy goodness, I loooved it, because who would've thought that dipping a churro into a tangy berry powder and then dunking it into dark hot drinking chocolate--this is yet another example of opposing flavors, e.g. sweet, tangy and tart, savory--all seamlessly blend together and play off each other, almost like jazz musicians spontaneously riff of each other.

The dining room space wasn't too shabby either. Reservations were hard to come by, thus we snagged an early 5:00 pm dinner. \n\nDinner started with complimentary sparkling water (my favorite!) and an offering of pintxos or bite-size skewers. I tried the house cured boquerones with white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guindilla peppers. It was full of flavor and set the tone for an amazing meal. We shared everything family-style with the following:\n\nChicken and English peas croquetas - these were wonderful and rich. They reminded me of fancy jalapeno poppers. The cured cara-cara orange was a nice contrast in flavor and as a palette cleanser. \n\nGambas al negro - great flavor from the gulf prawns and masterfully done with the black garlic and chili.\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizo dressing - probably my favorite dish of the night. Everything blended well together. It was very reminiscent of a Spanish-style breakfast. \n\nGrilled beef shortribs - this was my least favorite dish. The ribs were nothing special. They tasted texturally like Korean shortribs, but lacked the flavor. The glaze, pomegranate, and seville orange didn't add anything.\n\nPaella - this was the star entree of dinner. Made to be shared for two, there was easily enough to split amongst a party of three. If you like crispy bomba rice and seafood, this is the best.\n\nFor dessert, we opted to try the warm pimenton chocolate cake and the churros.

My mother had a hard time getting up on the bar stool and with the flies near us we decided to sit outside on the bench and picnic table where not a single fly bothered us. I immediately ordered the seafood paella since I knew this would take some time to cook. We also ordered one each of white wine and red wine Sangrias. Both were excellent, but the white was my favorite. We started with El Plat Cap a Chef's selection of cured meats. It consisted of house cured chorizo, fu\u00e9t, and Jam\u00f3n Serrano. First of all the portions were minuscule. For $26 I expected a little more on the platter. The slightly larger than a match stick sized and rectangular shaped salami was underwhelming. The chorizo had little flavor, was not bad, but no wow factor. The Jam\u00f3n Serrano was also underwhelming. All three lacked saltiness and more fat content. Next we ordered hot tapas. Patatas Bravas: very good with hints of smokiness and flash fried crisp served with Bravas salsa and garlic aioli, Pulpo a la Parilla: Wood grilled Mediterranean octopus served with fingerling potatoes and piment\u00f3n olive oil which was cooked perfectly. Although we weren't served a single tentacle, which is my favorite part of the octopus, but what was served was very good. Our last tapas was Alb\u00f3ndigas a la feria, duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry Tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot. These were slightly sweet, tart, tender, and moist. Good, but no wow factor here either. Lastly our paella was served. This was probably our biggest disappointment. I am use to saffron in my paella, which is synonymous with paella. Not a hint was detected. Not enough seafood broth was used either. First of all I couldn't detect any flavors of seafood. The paella had primarily tomato based flavors instead.

The grilled razor clams were a special that day. I think this was the first time I've had razor clams; they were quite tender and the sauce added some nice acidity.  The sunny side up huevo with shrimp was probably my favorite dish; the crispy potato strings gave the dish great texture and the chorizo dressing added some good heat. Next up, were the grilled duck and pork meatballs were solid and had great texture and flavor. Then came the paella which was quite massive, it probably could've fed a family of four. The flavors were excellent but I thought the rice ratio was a bit high compared to the proteins and veggies. If you know you're planning on getting this dish, order it first as it takes around 30-40 minutes for it to come out.\n\nWe capped things off with a decadent flan, they added a chocolate birthday card on the top of it for the birthday girl. This was the first restaurant of Michael Chiarello that I have dined at. I've heard good things about his restaurant in Napa but I thought this one fell a bit short. I thought the tapas were a bit small in their portions for the price and while flavors were solid for the mostpart, there wasn't anything mind-blowing.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-03-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I could recommend that you go with a larger group, at least 6 people, then you can take advantage and get the larger dishes like the beef rib eye and the paella."], "author": "Allen C.", "review": "Love the venue, and it has a great view. \n\nFood is pricey and that is expected if you are dining at one of the piers.

Unfortunately, we were running late, and although we called ahead, they had to give away our table so we had to wait another 25 minutes once we arrived at the restaurant. The worst part about having to wait for a table was that the bar area is small (slightly smaller than the restaurant side), and they also have people dining there, so there really isn't much room to sit or stand around. Also, one of the servers dropped a tray full of drinks on the floor and splashed my friends leg, and they apologized quickly but didn't bring a towel for her leg like they said.

The egg was cooked perfectly and went well with the other ingredients. The chorizo was really hard to chew, and was also on the salty side like the manchego. I wouldn't get either again.\n-Mar y Montana/Sea & Mountain (Ibercio Lardo Gently Melted Over Sea Urchin w/Lomo Iberico, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#7nTxEi7qt_RBSSzGo4Bn5Q): Delicious, and one of favorite dishes, although I wished there was enough uni to cover the entire cracker.\n-Pan Con Tomate (Iconic Cristal Bread & Tomato Sofrito, $5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#sMjWKLWkJTwKXoV1-4nlmg): So-so, the bread was too toasted/hard- skip!\n-Croquetas de Pollo (Chicharon Crusted Chicken & English Pea Croquetas w/Cured Cara Cara Orange, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#7YjlrIZZmhpWLqy4aTjAfQ): Delicious, and a must order!

Since its opening, it has been considered one of the best newcomers, with authentic Spanish cuisine that had North California touch. I went on a Sunday brunch and agree that Coqueta is a very solid restaurant.\n\nAny meal at Coqueta should start with pintxos, or bite-size skewers with various ingredients. I sampled all of the pintxos available, and all of them were tasty with a variety of ingredients from chorizo to anchovie to quails egg to pepper. You could tell that the North California focus on freshness of ingredients is also reflected in each bite. I proceeded to order a couple of tapas. \"Sunny side-up\" huevo with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing was a delicious dish that could work pretty well for brunch as well. I wished duck and pork meatballs were slightly less sweet, but there was nothing wrong with the absolutely crispy yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha accompanied by coal roasted romesco sauce.

Also I got a tendon kind of texture that ruined the meatball for me, I took one bite and didn't have any more\n\n*Patatas Bravas* - ugh, I was so disappointed in the little fried potatoes both last time and this time getting them.

She's charged with making reservations for an annual birthday dinner for four and once location has been decided upon she's on it like a pit bull on a turkey leg.  For dinner at Coqueta she was up at the crack of dawn to be the first to secure reservations the moment they supposedly became available.  And then.  Well.  Things didn't go as planned.  Despite more than adequate prep work, D found that there were no reservations to be had and I'm understating it when I say that she had a problem with that.  \n\nBeing resourceful and forceful D called Coqueta directly to lodge her complaint.  When a restaurant says that reservations open for a particular date on a particular date and you phone the moment those reservations supposedly open up there oughta be some reservations available.  That's essentially what she told the hostess then the manager then, I don't know, Michael Chiarello?  Anyhow, she made her point: she'd played by the rules, they had not, and we got our Saturday evening reservations for 4 as we should have without having had to take extraordinary steps.  \n\nSome might assume that such a tactic would result in a stink-eye greeting and food that's been sauced by generally inedible bodily fluids.  As far as I could discern, this didn't happen.  When we walked in the hostess greeted us with such cordial familiarity that I turned to D and asked \"Do you know her?\".  It was truly a GREETING.  Maybe word had gotten out not to mess with this party or maybe this hostess is always this enthusiastic.  Whatever; it was wonderful. \n\nMichael Chiarello restaurants are always beautiful.  It's a given.  Sometimes I've not cared as much for the food as I do for the interior (Tra Vigne), but such wasn't the case at Coqueta.  The menu was as gorgeous as the decor which was ridiculously special.  The illuminated Bay Bridge sits outside the windows, bone-in jamon sits drying on countertops (ala Barcelona), and the place just zings with energy.  Patrons here are having fun.  You can feel it in the electric air.  \n\nOur beautiful server reminded me of Project Runway winner Anya Ayoung Chee in both voice and looks.

We'd brought our own wine (which our server helpfully decanted), but that didn't keep us from beginning with cocktails as this is something in which Coqueta specializes.  Four uniquely different offerings were chosen, all epically named, and passed around like appetizers for each of us to sample from.  Don't miss the cocktails here.\n\nWe moved onto a wide assortment of menu offerings including a variety of \"bite-sized skewers\", cold tapas, hot tapas, sliced cured meats, Iberian cheeses, and a shared paella which was the best I've ever sampled.  We had studied Michael Bauer's review in advance of our meal and ordered well, based on many of his recommendations, even avoiding the open-faced sandwiches which he'd not found too special.  \n\nWe closed out with a variety of desserts including the crazily creative \"gazpacho\" which sent dry ice skirting across the table.  A wow-moment indeed, and a creative and fun way to close out a perfect meal.  \n\nDespite a dubious reservation experience, I found Coqueta to be first class from the moment I walked in until the moment I left.  There aren't a whole lot of high-end restaurants that I'm eager to go back to.  Coqueta is one I'd return to in an instant.

If chef Dominick Maietta has never tried them at least he could google them, and he would see that they are served over bread. $2.5 for a boiled quail egg and a piece of pepper without bread, is not just a scam, is simply disgusting. If he had ever visited a restaurant in Spain he would also know that the moment you sit down, there should be bread on the table.\n\nThe \"house cured\" serrano ham gives bad name to what serrano ham should be. It was really bland, with not enough taste and the texture was too soft. By the way, you do not put pepper on serrano ham.\n\nOne of the most surprising failures in the menu was the Pan con tomate. This is a traditional snack that even as a little children I could prepare by myself. You take a piece of bread, toast it, you rub half a tomato into it, add olive oil and salt, and you got it. Simple, cheap and delicious!... apparently even that is too complicated for the chef.

I'm actually not a big fan of gin in general because of its taste, but after having Coqueta's, I really liked it. It was very refreshing with a bit of a floral/fruity taste. A bit expensive for a drink though.\n\nChorizo: Just OK. The chorizo came as bite-size skewers with roasted artichokes and piquillo pepper. For the portion size, it was quite expensive and not worth it. Least impressive dish. \n\nSunny side-up egg with Shrimp and Crispy Potato: YUM. One of my favorite dishes even though it was a bit oily... The server would burst the egg yolk and mix it with the shrimp and crispy potatoes. The potatoes were really crispy, so when you eat all three together in a mixture, it had the perfect crunch to it. Nice texture to it. I think this dish would be perfect for brunch. \n\nWhole Monterey Calamari on the Plancha: Not your normal crispy calamari. Really liked the squid ink alioli with the calamari. Calamari was fresh and chewy. \n\nPaella: I have had paella at several other restaurants before. Honestly, it was just OK. The paella came with root vegetables, chorizo, prawns, clams, and lemon alioli. The lemon alioli paired well with the paella. Otherwise, nothing really stood out. Some of the seafood tasted a bit too fishy for me. :/\n\nPluma (Pork Shoulder Loin): Just OK... It was pretty tender, but nothing too special. It was already flavorful enough without having to pair it with the honey-chili glaze.\n\nSetas al ajillo: My other favorite dish of the night! Loved the flavors to the mushrooms. I felt healthy just eating it. It wasn't too heavy nor too oily. \n\nGrilled Albondigas: Duck and pork meatballs. At first bite, the texture was a bit weird for me.. It was a bit mushy, yet bursted with flavor... but past that, it was really delicious. A bit heavy, hearty, yet juicy.\n\nChurros with drinking hot chocolate and mixed berry powder: Dip the churro first into the mixed berry powder and then into the hot chocolate. It tasted very yummy! I really liked the combination of the two. A good way to end a delicious meal.\n\nWhat really bugged me was that there were quite a few flies at our table. Every time we tried to eat or drink, there was always at least one buzzing around. It was quite annoying.. :( Anyways, service was excellent.

The baby beets with watercress and blue cheese was artfully displayed, also gone in 60 seconds.  My husband and mom loved the grilled beef shortribs with sherry-chocolate glaze. We also ordered 2 of Michael's favorites -- the Whole Monterey calamari was soft and tasty, but the star of the show for me was the \"Mar y montana -- sea and mountain\".  This dish consisted of toast with iberico lardo and jamon iberico, gently melted over -- get this -- sea urchin. If there is one dish to define the chef's menu, I would choose this. I'm still dreaming about it.\n\nTop that off with a great bar menu (we had the sangria and margarita), and we can conclude that Coqueta is worth the hype!

Was far and away one of the best tapas dining experiences I've ever had! If you can't get a reservation, they also do walk-ins, but you risk a pretty long wait depending on how busy the night is, and they are constantly packed.\n\nOrdered: cured Serrano meats, Mar y montana open face sandwiches, Huevos Nacional, Coliflor con Romescu, \"Bikini\", \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo, and Pulpo a la Parilla\n\nHighlights included:\n- Beautiful gin and tonics (I ordered three of them and thoroughly enjoyed all of them)\n- Mar y montana open face sandwiches were to die for: essentially an open-faced uni sandwich and probably one of the most mouthwatering things I've ever eaten\n- Coliflor con Romescu: a cauliflower steak accompanied by Romescu sauce.. never had cauliflower with such explosive flavors! It was definitely one of my favorite dishes that night\n- Pulpo a la Parilla: the grilled octopus was tender and juicy and had great flavoring to it\n\nI thought the Sunny Side-up Huevo was a little too salty, and everything else, though delicious, I could do without ordering again (just based on personal preference; they were still excellent dishes).\n\nWe wanted to try the Spanish rice dish but were told it takes a long time to prepare and that they had to free up our table for the next party. I believe they have a limit of 90 minutes when you're dining there and it's easy to see why. We had stayed for 2 hours at that point and were still trying to order the rest of the menu... haha. The ambiance is elegant but casual; perfect for some nibbles and drinks after a day of work.\n\nOne thing I will mention is that portion sizes are SMALL. These are tapas and are not meant to fill you up or serve as an entire main dinner. If you're looking for that, try some of their larger-sized items.

The restaurant is quite beautiful especially with the ocean view, tall buildings, and night lights from the bridge.\n\nWe arrived at 6:30 PM and waited 20 minutes on a Friday night which was not bad at all considering it's the prime time on the prime day to eat out. Our seat was not bad and was actually quite desirable and much to everyone's liking.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nEL PLAT CAP ($26): This is the chef's selection of cured meats. This was excellent, I'll have to say but not that interesting. The meats specially selected were salami, prosciutto, and one that resembled salami but with a tinge of red orange. They gave 18 pieces, six of each type. The presentation was spot on with a piece of menu cut up and the wooden board it was served on giving a rustic feel. Though the quality was top notch, for $26 it wasn't worth it.\n\nSUNNY SIDE-UP EGG ($12): This was very innovative if you ask me. I love the idea of shoestring crispy potatoes piled high with fried egg, shrimp, and chorizo dressing. I don't know why or what it so special but the combination worked. This reminded me of a breakfast item since there were hash browns (crispy potato) and fried egg.\n\nGRILLED RAZOR CLAMS ($14): This was amazing and was one of the best dishes of the night. This is a very rare find and cannot be found at any place I can think of. The clams had the perfect consistency, were juicy, and given in a generous portion. Highly recommended!\n\nWOOD-GRILLED OCTOPUS OCTOPUS ($12): This was amazing and the version at Evvia in Palo Alto was comparable. It was so simplistic yet so delicious. It wasn't rubbery and was tender and very moist. \n\nGAUCHO ($80): This was probably my least favorite dish of the night but was great for meat lovers. It was a special and was basically a hunk of steak cut up. It was cooked perfectly; not too done or too rare. However, it was filling and boring since meat I can go elsewhere for. They gave a generous portion of six pieces but again I wouldn't pay $80 for something I'm not too keen on. \n\nPAELLA ($40): This was so good in every aspect. They gave a great portion and the flavors from the shellfish seeped into the paella which made it tasty. The ingredients added, asparagus, chorizo, gulf prawns, clams, and lemon aioli, made sense with the dish. The concept was new to me and the moment I ate it I fell in love and have tried to find places that serve it let alone replicate it. The closest I've found was Jaleo in Las Vegas but that didn't even compare to the quality I found here.\n\nJAMON PINTXO ($2.50): This was prosciutto wrapped around two pieces of manchego cheese topped with apricot jam. I never thought that a combination like this would taste so good. It was innovative, sweet (from the apricot jam), and salty (from the cheese and prosciutto).\n\nWARM CHOCOLATE CAKE ($10): For any chocolate lovers, I recommend ordering a couple of these. It was very good and the assorted nuts on the side were a great touch to the overall presentation, which was beautiful as always. There was some sauce on the top; a perfect finish to the perfect presentation of the perfect dessert.\n\nMANCHEGO CHEESECAKE ($4): I didn't try this but it looked very innovative yet a bit sweet for my taste. The addition of caramel popcorn was nice. My brother confirmed it was sweet but enjoyed it nonetheless. They provided two smaller pieces which was fair for the price.\n\nPAN CON CHOCOLATE ($4): This had ice cream cookie on the bottom with olive oil ice cream on the top. It paired quite nicely and was delicious. My only gripe was that parts of the olive oil ice cream were saltier. It kind of threw me off but nevertheless it was a brilliant combination.\n\nCOFFEE ($6): They serve Four Barrel coffee which is top notch. Though, I didn't sample this, my dad enjoyed it. The cup they provided it in was very innovative because the glass around the cup prevented customers from burning themselves. \n\nSERVICE: They were really courteous which was expected. They paced everything out very well and made our night an unforgettable one. \n\nDECOR: There are two sides of the restaurant whereas one side is more of a wine bar where the exterior is reminiscent of a green house with beautiful glass windows. Another side is more like a formal dining hall and is for those hoping for a proper meal. Though a bit loud, it adds to the overall experience. No matter which side you get, you should make the most out of your experience because everything from the service to the atmosphere to the innovative creations courtesy of chef Michael Chiarello, is like none you've had before and truly is a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\".\n\nWill I return? Yes please! Though the experience is over and it came out to $50 per person it was well worth it because as I said it's a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\".

Since the meters were only required until 6pm, we only had to pay $1.50 for half an hour on the meter.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\nSUNNY SIDE-UP HUEVO:  Very good.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  It was like really thin shoestring potatoes with a few shrimp and a sunny side-up egg on top.  Our waitress came and mixed it all up for us.\n\nCROQUETA DE POLLO:  This comes with 3 pieces, but the waitress recommended that we add one more.  Looked like tater tots, with a crunchy outside and tender inside.   It was very tasty.\n\nPANTATAS BRAVAS:  Not too special.  Tasted just like plain thumb-size potatoes.    The sauce had little taste.\n\nCALAMARES A LA PLANCHA:  Four small squid with a dab of squid ink.  This was just ok, nothing special.\n\nSETAS AL AJILLO:  Wild mushrooms with a hint of chili.  This was pretty good.\n\nESPARRAGOS TRIGEROS CON ROMESCO:  Not sure what the green was, but it tasted like spinach.  Loved it!  \n\nPAELLA:  We ordered this as soon as we got there because it takes 30-40 minutes to prepare.  This was the last dish that they brought out and it was a good size serving.  The four of us couldn't finish it.  It was average.\n\nLIMONADA:  This was sooo good.  Lemonade with a couple of blueberries inside and a rosemary twig.\n\nThe portions are really small.  For four of us, we only got like a couple of bites from each dish, except for the Paella.\n\nFor Dessert, we shared the Churros.  There were 4 small pieces served with \"drinking chocolate\" and berry powder.  We dipped the churros in the chocolate and then dipped it in the powder.  The combination tasted like a cherry filled donut.\n\nThe staff were really friendly and did a great job explaining the dishes to us.  They refilled our water constantly.  Our bill was about $50 per person.  It would be worth coming again to try some of the other dishes because they have such a wide variety and each dish is so unique.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["The port shoulder was amazing and the paella was the best I've had outside of Spain.

When the server started with \"Welcome to Coqueta, we offer a Spanish menu...\" we maybe should have know something was up, like this was going to be the TGI Friday's of something. Sitting at the bar facing the kitchen is great because you get to see the food come out. It loses some of that shine because the server always comes up from behind and startles you or has to reach around with dishes/flatware/water/etc. while the food comes from in front. Would be much better if there was just a server behind the bar taking orders, which might be a little tight but much better experience.\n\nFood: The pintxos were good, but slicing manchego and chorizo for $2.50 each isn't a big accomplishment. The blue cow cheese was good. The salads we tried were very bland and I'm not sure I've seen a kale salad with strawberries and chunks of cheese masquerading as butter in spain before. Shrimp were a bit dry but ok, could use a little bit of sauce. As noted earlier the rice was good, with asparagus and peas, and again, more italian summer than spanish. The paella looked good but we were dissuaded by the 30-40 min wait.\n\nDesserts looked great but the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream was a bit too much after the food we had.\n\nOverall, maybe a bit too much anticipation based on past Bottega experiences but not in a real hurry to go back.

Just to be clear, I'm more than happy to pay $150+ a person for a Spanish tapas restaurant, but there has to be a reason why a dish is so expensive -- a Celebrity chef shouldn't automatically skyrocket the price of 8 slices of grilled pork to $38. The pork should taste like it's $38, or maybe at least $30 with an $8 \"Celebrity chef\" tax. \n\nHonestly, though, as long as you know that you will be overpaying and you are content with knowing that you will be overpaying, Coqueta really is a solid Spanish restaurant in SF. There are many millionaires in SF who use $100 bills like Charmin Ultra sheets, so there will definitely be people who don't care, and for those people, Coqueta is great.\n\n----------------\nFOOD:\n\nPluma (Grilled Pork with Honey) =\nNicely grilled, but definitely under-seasoned without the honey. The honey gives the pork a wonderful, subtle sweetness, but the pork itself just isn't worth $38 for 8 slices. I don't care if there was an incredible scientific breakthrough that managed to reincarnate Julia Child and zombie Julia Child cooked up this meal for me, no celebrity chef should be charging this much for 8 pieces of bland pork that has to be drenched with honey.\n\nSerrano Ham w/ Manchego Cheese Pintxo =\nGood ham, good cheese -- the bite was the size of a tic tac, but it was a satisfying bite.\n\nEnglish Pea Croquettes =\nDelicious chicken pot pie croquettes -- nicely fried with a strong, creamy flavor.\n\nPaella =\nVery good paella -- excellent texture of the rice, subtly spiced, and with lots of crispy rice to give it a great overall consistency. Goes amazingly well with the peppers and aioli they give you on the side.\n\nGrilled Octopus =\nThe octopus was a bit too mushy, and not tender like how grilled octopus is supposed to be. The fingerling potatoes were tasteless -- I think this dish would go better with a puree or at least something with a bit more flavor.\n\nFig Tart with Blue Cheese Ice Cream =\nFig tart was just okay -- tasted like a stale pop tart. BUT the Blue Cheese Ice Cream was INCREDIBLE. Honestly, we spent about 10 minutes contemplating if we should try the Blue Cheese Ice Cream, because it sounded horrific but it definitely piqued our curiosity. Best decision of the night. Subtle blue cheese flavor, but the perfect amount of sweetness that ended with a satisfying end. This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors ever and I wish the fig tart wasn't there in the way.\n\nChurros =\nPerfectly fried churros. The chocolate sauce wasn't strong enough to do anything of substance, but the churros themselves were excellent. Again -- not sure if it's worth the $8 price tag, though.\n----------------\n\nCoqueta is an excellent addition to the Embarcadero and it definitely has its spectacular moments (Blue Cheese Ice Cream, Paella) but I was just expecting more, given the prices and the hype.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Enjoyed paella, shortribs, soft cooked egg with crispy potato, kale salad...would order any of these again!

Overhearing our neighbors discuss similar issues - and worse - kind of put us on edge at the start.\n\nThe cocktail list is long and complex, but the cocktails we sampled tended to be overly sweet and overly savory, with somewhat muddied flavors brought on by the sheer number of ingredients.  We had a hard time finding something simply refreshing, which would have worked well as a foil to the generally salty, savory food.\n\nSpeaking of the food - it's good.  Others have laid it out in exquisite detail, but a few notes:  The squid dish was overly salty and inferior to a couple others we chanced upon that week.  Three spears of fresh delta asparagus with a *fuchsia* sauce glopped on one end might be considered by some to be excessively priced at $8.  The paella looked good, if a little overdone, at the next table over.  We opted for Arroz dish, which tasted better than the paella looked.\n\nService ranged from okay to strange to inattentive.

Thankfully, I was correct but it was a little odd to me that she didn't say anything first - if you don't have a uniform or dress code, how am I suppose to know that you're a hostess if you don't say anything?  Strange.  \n\nMy family and I were shown to our table promptly - truthfully, I was disappointed.  If you make reservations weeks in advance, you'd think that they'd have one of the best tables set aside for you....we were seated by the door in the middle of a high traffic zone - flies kept buzzing around our food and drinks.  When I went to Bottega for my birthday last year, the staff selected a wonderful table on their patio and even had a little card with a birthday greeting - it was seriously awesome.  Coqueta had neither of those.  A smidge disappointing... \n\nWhile the staff offered water promptly - it was awhile before we were acknowledged by our server.

Some of their drinks are hit-or-miss, and this one is a hit.  Engine Co. #5 ($13) is also good if you like Manhattans; it's very similar to one.  I didn't enjoy the Championship \"Policy\" ($12) much, so I wouldn't get that.\n\nMost of the food is good; you really can't go wrong.  They bring around a platter of toothpick-skewers ($2.50 ea.)

Last Saturday was the second time I've gone and I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars because not every dish was a hit and your wallet takes a hit when the bill comes. Granted this shouldn't be a huge shock considering the location, and the view/ambiance is awesome. The interior of the restaurant is really interesting and the outside bar area is a great place for cocktails before dinner.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for our reservation and were a little disappointed that they tried to seat us at the bar. Since we made the reservation far in advance and asked if there was a table available, they were nice enough to accommodate but had to wait an extra 35 minutes in the packed bar/tent area.  The outside bar had some of the best and most interesting cocktails I've had. A++ for the conquistador and also high scores for the Revolution. We tried a few others as well and they were good. \n\nAs for food, most of our selections were outstanding but a few were pretty average. We tried the chorizo pinxtos which were fun, bite-sized piece of meat, but at 2.50$ each it's tough to get too many. We also started with the open faced smoked salmon sandwich, a great choice. Another hit was the meatballs. The wood grilled octopus was hit or miss, some in the party loved it, others thought just ok. It wasn't tough, I just think some people don't like octopus. We tried the paella which was a huge portion and it was good to try, but didn't knock our socks off which was a bit of a disappointment. The pork loin dishes are must tries. The pluma is fantastic and has a great sauce with it, but at 38$ for a few bites your left feeling unsatisfied. We got churros for dessert which were forgettable.\n\nThe service was good, very helpful, especially giving advice with cocktail options.

I'm not a gin or tonic person at all. It is basically my least favorite drink of all time.

No joke, this drink was amazing. I loved it so much, now every morning I wake up and immediately have a glass full of gin waiting for me next to my bed.

The kale salad and chard - were just OK. The uni open faced sandwich was good too  - but when considering how expensive it was it was two tiny circles of toast with uni and proscitto, just a bit bigger than a bagel bite, I don't think I would order that one again! We ordered two plates of each tapa so our group of 8 could try everything. Our main entrees were the 1) ribeye - so juicy and amazing, they bring out the ginormous gorgeous meat before cutting it so we can see it in it's full glory, a showstopper entree, 2) the pork pluma with honey-chili glaze - my favorite but the bigger pieces were just too rare for me and we sent half of it back to be seared which they did with a smile (thankful the waitstaff was down to earth and did not try to shame us for not digging extra rare pork - no matter what the pig's pedigree), and 3) the paella  - beautiful but at that point we were all stuffed and don't think we could really appreciate how good it was.\n\nFor dessert we got the churros and flan. Maybe I am crazy but I liked the flan more! I just don't know if these fancy churros with chocolate dipping sauce are really better than Disneyland churros...It was good - but again, may not have been able to really appreciate it since I was so stuffed.\n\nIn short - amazing food, beautiful restaurant, and a perfect place to celebrate with friends. I would not come here as a couple on a date night - you won't get to have a real tapas experience and try a bit of everything. I would also not come here except for special occasions - just too pricey!

Being right on the water the space has a great feel and the staff in general was great, but from the second you walk in you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for everything (which is the opposite of Bottega).  We went expecting to drop a bomb on food as that was kind of the point of this splurge trip to San Francisco, so didn't mind the high menu prices, but rather the way things were forced on you.  For instance, as soon as you sit down they bring you a tray with about 2 dozen \"bite sized skewers\" (Pintxos) which they present as an amuse-bouche (which is almost expected at nicer restaurants these days); however, once you take one, waitress explains they are $2.50 each (really not worth it for food that has just been sitting out and visited every table in restaurant...ick....and yes, I have spent time in Spain, where this is done at bars, but this just feels wrong). \nMoving on, we each ordered about 2 Tapas plates (there were 4 of us) and Paella....we were going to add on more but waitress said it would be plenty of food.

It would have been totally been fine if she mentioned this, but instead just decided to add this to our bill which just seemed slimy.\nOkay, so onto the food.\nCroquetas De Pollo:  Tasty fried croquettes....hard to screw up something like this so obviously good.\nGambas al Negor:  Very good and has a nice kick to it with the pepper.\nTotillita de Camaron: Everyone felt this was okay but not great.\nPulpo a la Parilla:  The grilled octopus was highlight of entire meal and wish I just ordered several plates of it.  It was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth.\nAlbondigas a la Feria: The duck meatballs just felt kind felt kind of flat.  Maybe it was that the cherry sauce was too weak....raspberry would make it a million times better.\nPatatas Xips e Salsa Apertivo: The chips are great, but $7 for 6 small potato chips is just ridiculous (this should be something they just include with the meal).\nHuevos Nacional: Great presentation and overall taste, but the bonito essentially tastes like chicken of the sea.\nEsparrago Trigeros con Remesco: excellent flavor and taste.\nEnsalada de Remolacha:  good, but ridiculously small serving size.\nPaella: Says it serves 2-3, but really the seafood is about enough for 1.5, and the rice is for 3.  It was okay, but dry and really not any better than any standard corner Spanish restaurant (which we have a lot of in NYC).\n\nBy the way, the Sangria is really nice and light and refreshing.\n\nIn summary, it is good and has a great atmosphere, but we weren't blown away and while we expected to spend a lot, felt deceived by how hidden costs were added to the bill.\n\nFinally, I have to say that  I am impressed with how present Michael Chiarello is at his restaurants.

It's lovely, though I feel like the waterfront location and soaring ceilings were better suited to the light and open look it had previously, versus this cozy Spanish vibe they were aiming for.  Maybe because it's summer, and we were there for dinner fairly early so it was quite \"daytime\" - it may work better when it's dark out.  The servers uniforms are cool, but just this side of costumey.  The staff seems very knowledgable, especially for not having been open very long.\nAn unexpected Chiarello sighting (being swarmed by excited, middle aged women) was a fun perk.  \nThe tortilla was good, as were some of the pintxos, and the board of meats and cheeses.  The chicken and pea croquetas were a standout - they were basically little chicken pot pies.  The octopus was tender, the gigantic steak was delicious (though gritty - I imagine that was pepper, but it felt like rocks), and the pan con tomate, while not traditional at all, was delicious.  A word of caution - pass the glass jar of tomato separately or it might slide off the board and shatter all over the table and everyone's food.  And that's where they lost me.\nCocktails were so-so to completely watered down (don't get me started on the nearly flavorless sangria).  The gambas were super fishy and unappetizing, as was the paella, but I'm not a fan of strong fish flavors, so maybe you'll be more impressed (I felt the same way about the anchovies, which I know I don't like but tried anyway, and the razor clams, which I skipped on account of knowing for certain that I don't like - though neither did anyone else at the table).  The tattas bravas tasted oddly chemical, the beet salad was okay but nothing special.  I liked the addition of raisins and pine nuts to the vineyard greens, but they weren't great.  I didn't try the churros (donuts are donuts), but I snagged a bite of one of the cheesecakes - eh.\nThere is better, more affordable Spanish food elsewhere in the city, but if you're a fan of MC, or looking for a swanky waterfront locale, it's worth a try.

Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar.

First of all, I called when it opened for lunch exactly a month before the day I wanted to dine, but was told it was only possible for me to make a reservation at 5:00 PM or much later in the evening, since most tables stay occupied between 6:00 and 8:00 PM...  Okay, 5:00 PM was fine with me.  Then it seemed like he completely butchered my phone number, name, and number of guests.  (It really bothered me, so I called the next day to reconfirm and to make sure everything was correct, which it wasn't; thankfully, the woman who answered this time was MUCH more helpful.  After she finally figured out which reservation was actually mine...)  Unfortunately, this experience made me apprehensive.\n\nFortunately, when we arrived at the pier, we were quickly taken to our table, which was right next to the kitchen.  For the meal we tried:\n\n- Pintxos: The quail egg was my favorite; I probably could have sat there the entire night just eating those.  The combinations were definitely spot on.\n- Patatas bravas: Such a simple dish, yet SOO DELICIOUS!  The garlic aioli that came with it was UHHHMAZING.\n- Gambas al negro: I thought they were perfectly cooked and super juicy.  My girlfriends let me have all the shrimp heads, so that was a bonus for me!\n- Monterey calamari: Pretty good, but I'm a huge fan of squid and felt like I've had better.\n- Octopus: SO UNEXPECTEDLY TENDER!  We loved it, the flavoring was on point too.\n- Duck and pork meatballs: We all thought it was interesting...; definitely did not expect it to be sweet, so I guess that threw us off.  Probably wouldn't order it again.\n- Paella: SOOO, I had expectations for the paella, and it did not reach my expectations.  There was nothing outstanding about it.  We shared 1 order of the paella between 5 people and that was enough.\n- Churros: DELISH. The raspberry dusting was a great combination.\n\nOur waitress also was very informative and was accommodating in adjusting each dish so that each of us had at least one serving of everything.  We really wanted to try to uni open-faced sandwich, but was told they weren't able to acquire any uni for that day.  The drinks were also great; definitely stand out and interesting.\n\nBUT THE SERVICE. The service started off really well.  Our waitress was attentive, but a quarter through our meal, she stopped serving us without explanation even though she was still serving other tables, and we got another server, who checked in very little.  It seems once we placed our orders they were just waiting for us to finish.  For the price of the meal, the service was definitely not on par and not what I expected.\n\nIn conclusion, it was definitely a must on my list of restaurants to try in San Francisco.  Not a fan of the price tag of each plate for the amount of food you are getting and the service, but the dishes were delicious and I could tell each component of each dish was well thought out.  I would give this place a 3.5 if I could, but the flavor combinations were on point and I'm a sucker for tapas, so 4 stars.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-03-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Very good paella.

We ordered six tapas, and all were good to very good, but none were to-die-for-I-must-have-it-again.  The dishes are creative and presented well.  The house cured boquerones were delish, as were the house-cured white anchovies.  My son's fave was the Sunny side-up egg with shrimp.  The crispy shrimp pancake was interesting and crunchy, but I am always turned off when I see sauce that has been applied through a squeeze bottle.  It screams \"bulk food\" no matter how haute.  Lukewarm on the grilled albondigas, but to be fair the eaters are more used to ground beef.  We went for the paella, which was something of a letdown after all the tapas.

I wouldn't get either again.\n-Mar y Montana/Sea & Mountain (Ibercio Lardo Gently Melted Over Sea Urchin w/Lomo Iberico, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#7nTxEi7qt_RBSSzGo4Bn5Q): Delicious, and one of favorite dishes, although I wished there was enough uni to cover the entire cracker.\n-Pan Con Tomate (Iconic Cristal Bread & Tomato Sofrito, $5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#sMjWKLWkJTwKXoV1-4nlmg): So-so, the bread was too toasted/hard- skip!\n-Croquetas de Pollo (Chicharon Crusted Chicken & English Pea Croquetas w/Cured Cara Cara Orange, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#7YjlrIZZmhpWLqy4aTjAfQ): Delicious, and a must order! I loved the crispy exterior and flavors of this dish.\n-Paella (Bomba Rice, Jamon Serrano-Shellfish Broth, Gulf Shrimp, Clams, Chorizo, Broccolini, Asparagus, Lemon Aioli, $45, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#HcbQiZU1V13XykUDhQ-9_Q):  This dish serves 2-3, but will take 30-40 minutes to prepare. I thought it was ok for a paella, and liked that it didn't have a ton of saffron. However, some of the seafood was overcooked, and it wasn't so amazing that I would order it again.\n-Pulpo a la Parilla (Wood-Grilled Octopus, Fingerling Potatoes, Pimenton Olive Oil, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#f6lN_Z-PlQ3Xr-qWkcUiSA): Just ok- the octopus was slightly overcooked and a bit chewy- skip.\n-Trio de Salchichas (Grilled Sausages Glazed w/Isastegi Cider, Fresh Cherries, Mojo Verde, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#6YXa0rpoeFfB1lrKSRUtYg): We had a blood sausage, and I can't remember what the other two were, but none were very good.\n-Albondigas a la Feria (Grilled Duck & Pork Meatballs w/Tart Cherry & Tempranillo Salsa, Crispy Shallots, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#FQsk6YVpQWVK8BiSBlPZqg): Ok, but nothing special. Skip!\n-Churro \"Fantasia\" (Crispy Spanish Doughnuts w/Drinking Chocolate, Mixed Berry Powder, $8, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#ZEjAfXXdtSpYUXO3UiZMcg): The churros were good, but I wasn't a fan of the drinking chocolate. \n-Manchego Cheesecake w/Caramel Popcorn ($4, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=FKmGFahRhf_zt3vx1Mjgaw#Cc2maG1NIl1gCC0YW3CIPg): I didn't like this much- the manchego flavor was really strong/salty, and the combination didn't work for me although my friends liked it.\n\nOur server was ok and friendly, but she took almost 10 minutes to greet us once we were sat since I think she was stretched too thin amongst tables. At least our food came quickly once we ordered. Overall, I wasn't that impressed by the dishes we had, and enjoyed my dining experience at his other restaurant much more (Bottega in Yountville).", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-10-18"}, {"excerpts": ["- Trio de Salchichas (grilled sausages glazed with isastegi cider, apple and mojo verde)\n- Pimientos de Padron (Roasted padron peppers with Jam\u00f3n Serrano and sherry vinegar)\n- Ensalada de Kale (lacinato kale, roasted squash, fresh pomegranate and warm garbanzo dressing)\n- Ensalada de Achicoria (grilled chicory greens, granacha poached pear, sliced apple, and serrano ham vinaigrette)\n\n"], "author": "Rachel C.", "review": "Really lovely dinner date spot or for drinks with friends/coworkers after work.

"], "author": "Gigi G.", "review": "True Basque food has been sadly missing from the Bay Area dining scene - until the past year when three spots: Coqueta in San Francisco, Donostia in Los Gatos, and Mundaka in Carmel have (thankfully) opened to introduce some pretty authentic riffs on this under-represented cuisine. \n\nCoqueta is a fun, quality and idealized version of a tapas tavern, and a definite recommendation for anyone interested in testing the waters of Spanish cuisine. Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar.

Prefer the shrimp cake at Delica in the Ferry Building\n- Woodfired grill octopus -- really tender and enjoyed the dish.

The room on the right is for reservations and the patio/bar seating on the left is for first come first serve (self-seat). At 7:45pm, the place was packed but after fishing around for ~5 mins, a party got up and we snagged their table !! woo hoo !\n\nThe seatings in the bar area is so weirdly cute. We were literally eating off a vertical tree log! The vibe was cozy and casual. Not necessarily warm so layer up!\n\nThe GRUBBS:\n\n- Jamon Iberia de Bellota ($29): The bf really like his meats so when he saw this imported cured meat appetizer, he was ecstatic. The app came out in this tiny cute wooden board with slices of thin cured meat imported from Spain. It also came with these cone looking crackers to wrap our meat around. The meat was so flavorful and delicious. Had me licking my fingers after each bite.\u00a0\n\n- Salmon Ahumado ($8): Came in 2 lox bagels topped with smoked salmon, quest fresco and truffle honey. This is by far my MOST FAVORITE dish of the night! Super tasty!!! Never had I thought to eat smoked salmon with truffle honey; the combination of smokey and sweetness was just crazy. I was sooo in love with this dish I had to get seconds!! MUST TRY!\n\n- Mar y Montana ($14): darnns.... This was the one dish that captured my attention the most.... cause of the sea urchin! but it wasn't as great as I'd hope it to be. Pretty bland and boring. The uni was a bit bitter. Definitely prefer the salmon ahumado more. won't order again.\u00a0\n\n- Pulpo a la Parilla ($14): wood grilled Mediterranean octopus with fingerling potatoes. YUMM. The octopus was so tender and slightly chewy! The herbs brought out the taste and paired with the fingerling potatoes was divine.\u00a0\n\n- Pluma ($38): Pork shoulder loin with honey-chilled glaze. OMG. fantastic flavors! Made medium rare, the meat was flavored unbelievably good. Could even do without the honey-chilled glaze! The meat was so juicy and charred with a hint of spice to it. This was the best finishing touch to our meal. left us super satisfied and craving our next return already.\u00a0\n\nDRINKS:\n\n- Barca Gintonic ($13): London dry gin with fever tree tonic grapefruit and thyme. wow. the presentation was so beautiful. Literally looked like a pretty flower garden in a cup. Citrusy, refreshing, and delicious!\n\n- Spanish Holiday ($13): Technically vodka, lemon, and soda. Nothing too special and kinda watered down and not strong.\u00a0\n\nOverall, a great dining experience. Loved the atmosphere and the food. Perfect date spot for couples or a girls night out for drinks and catching up. I advise making a reservation.\n\nIn total, our bill was ~$153 pre-tip. A bit pricy for the small portion but this is a tapas place. Everything was just the right amount for two from what we ordered.

He made reservations for us to sit at the chef's table. The interior of this restaurant is beautifully rustic with very tall ceilings to create that open roominess to it. My boyfriend and I sat inside but I bet sitting outside on the piers is stunningly beautiful. \n\n* Bar\u00e7a Gin & Tonic *\nThis is perhaps the most beautiful gin and tonic I've ever seen of had in my life. It has a strong floral smell and the lightest, most refreshing taste. \n\n* Spanish Holiday *\nThis is a gin and tonic with very citrusy and lemony tones. Not as beautiful as the one mentioned above but I personally liked this one better in terms of taste (I love hints of lemon and cucumber). \n\n* Mar y Monta\u00f1a *\nThis appetizer includes two pieces of uni resting on toasted bread, topped with thinly sliced slivers, to the point there's spots of transparency, of melt-in-your-mouth pork. The flavor of the pork masks any taste that the uni has to offer but the texture of the uni makes it feel as though it were a buttery spread. Nothing too special about this dish for me, but if you love uni go for it!\n\n* Pulpo a la Parrilla *\nI've never had octopus taste and feel so much like meat before until I had this dish. The octopus is tender without losing its classic chewiness. You can actually taste the smokiness from when it is wood grilled; SO GOOD! It comes with the most tender and buttery fingerling potatoes that actually taste like legit potatoes; this is a nice contrast to the chewy and flavorful octopus. \n\n* Alb\u00f3ndigas a la Feria *\nThis dish comes with three ginormous, moist meatballs that are absolutely packed with flavor. Each meatball is topped with crispy shallots resting in a tangy sauce that is reminiscent of wine. This is the most delicious (and fancy) meatball I have ever had in my life. Not sure if I would get it again but it was definitely worth experiencing once. \n\n* Pluma *\nThis was my favorite dish of the night. I've never had pork that tasted so sweet and moist on its own. You can drizzle on a honey-chili sauce for even more flavor but it's definitely delicious on its own as well. The meat is unbelievably tender and it's almost like you can taste the acorn-diet of the pig as well; absolutely stunning. I can see myself ordering this dish every time with no regrets.\n\n* Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche *\nThis dessert was recommended by our waitress but unfortunately I don't really see the appeal. The cake is very dry and if it were not for the ice cream on top, I probably wouldn't have been able to eat the cake. I don't think the rice pudding in the center of the cake makes this dessert that special. However, the huckleberry sauce that the cake rests is pretty good.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-09-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The second drink I tried was one of their Spanish Gin & Tonics, named the Spanish Holiday.

Just love this space, I could sit in the corner booth for days. \n\nMichael Chiarello in the kitchen is never a bad view. He is one of the most handsome charming people on the planet and to boot offers some of the best fresh culinary dishes I've had. Which leads me to The Gaucho... hands down one of the best steaks. I have heard this from dozens of others as well in concert. The wooden platter it arrives on is spectacular in its own right, but this steak is above and beyond seasoned and cooked to perfection. I won't even describe it for you because you must try this for yourself. Accompanied by the pepper dish, asparagus and various house cured jamon plates are a sure thing.

Waterfront location with a view of the Bay Bridge and the Bay Bridge Lights for the next two years. Can't go wrong. Our waitress approached us, took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to decide on our tapas choices. We ordered the House-cured chorizo sandwiches, Chicken and English pea croquettes, Whole Monterey calamari on the plancha, and the Warm Pimenton chocolate cake with tamarind crema for dessert. \n\nIt was noticeable there was some confusion with the front of the house. Another party's drinks were brought to us minutes after we received our drinks. Afterward, our chorizo sandwiches walked by us as a food runner approached each group sitting in the bar area asking if they had ordered the sandwiches. We had to politely flag him down and let him know it was our order. Next, our waitress brought us a dish we did not even order while the dishes we did order were 'walking around' the same way our chorizo sandwiches did until our waitress grabbed them. Lastly, we were presented with the wrong bill.\n\nOverall, it was an okay first experience. The food is amazing, although slightly over priced. The bread for the chorizo sandwiches had a nice crunch, and the chorizo itself had great flavor. The croquettes were a little hot at first. But once they cooled, they were tasty. The piece of grapefruit after was a nice finish. The calamari had to be my favorite of the savory dishes we ordered that night. The squid ink aioli and greens on the side balanced the dish nicely. The chocolate cake - I would definitely come back for that. You need to give the kitchen notice as it does say on the menu it takes about 220 minutes to make the dessert. But it's well worth it.

Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar.

It was served with some caramelized onions for that salty and sweet flavor that was wonderful.\n- Salmon Alhumado ($8) - Absolutely DELICIOUS! Winner of the day!! Sad that it was $4 for each bite. The smoked salmon was at excellent quality and the truffle honey was mind blowing. The flavor contrast from the salty smoked salmon and the truffle honey paired super well together and the truffle enhanced all of the flavors and blended them together. It was like a flavor explosion in the mouth. Encore!!!\n\nWe were stuffed at the end of the meal and were happy to say the dishes were all very good! Our bill came to be $125 plus tax for two, which definitely is not your normal daily lunch!

He gave us great suggestions on how to order from the menu. He said typically, people usually order one big entree with three tapas or they order three tapas each. Their most popular entree is the paella, and since I'm not that fond of paella, we opted to order three tapas each. \n\n* Patatas bravas \n* Coles de Bruselas (crispy brussel sprouts)\n* \"Sunny side up\" huevo\n* Albondigas a la feria (duck and pork meatballs)\n* Jamon Iberico de Bellota\n* Pluma (pork shoulder)\n\nI really liked how our waiter paired our tapas together in the order of bringing out the dishes! They're such small dishes that you think you won't be full, but by the 5th dish, you're struggling to eat even just a bite. But SOOO GOOD. \n\nThe potatoes had the right amount of crisp that I like. All their meats are thoroughly marinated and full of LIFE! I was a little hesitant on eating the pork shoulder because it was still somewhat red, but it had enough sauce and flavor that I didn't taste the medium rare-ness of it.\n\nMy boyfriend told our waiter that it was our anniversary so he said he would work something out for us. (Bf told him while I was in the bathroom.) He ordered the bizcocho de arroz. When our dessert was brought out, our waiter threw in two caramel cheesecake bites for free. The bizcocho had a piece of chocolate that said \"Feliz cumpleanos\" haha but hey, it's the thought that counts. OMG as if the food couldn't get any better. As I've said in many reviews, I've got quite the sweet tooth and both desserts didn't disappoint.\nOh! How could I forget the drinks that we ordered?!

I had the Pan con Tomate y Jamon ($10 - the server totally upselled me on this one, dammit), which was fine. Instead of fresh tomato, the bread was served with some kind of tomato jam/chutney, which was decent.\n\nNext came the Red Kale Ensalada ($11) with roasted squash, persimmons, pumpkin seeds, and a warm, Rancho Gordo garbanzo bean dressing. That was, hands down, our favorite dish of the evening. I'm all about kale salads, and I could have eaten about two more orders of this.

The glaze itself is tasty, and I'm sure people love to slather their pork with it, but I used it a bit sparingly. I would have loved to have a side of Maldon/sea/kosher salt. I like my meat simple. I'm kinda like a cavewoman in that way.\n\nI was pretty full by this point, but I *had* to have dessert. You know, for research purposes.

The rest of the team was also on point, making sure our water glasses were always filled, our napkins were folded upon returning to our chairs, clearing away empty dishes promptly, etc. We showed our appreciation by leaving them more than 20%.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nI really love what they did to that space. The architects and designers managed to create a warm, casual and modern atmosphere out of essentially an old pier in a cold and foggy city. One would think that with all the diners in the room, with all this concrete and huge space, that it would be noisy. It wasn't too bad (and my boyfriend's kind of a low-talker sometimes, and I'm kinda deaf sometimes, and we managed to have a great conversation!). \n\nHowever, the kitchen looked disorganized: Boxes and boxes of I don't know what, stacked 5 high on top of this seemingly 2-story shelf behind the chef's counter, bottles of wine and mezcal on the shelves, mixed with huge jars of pimenton, Asturian beans, and other kitchen staples; behind that, the prep area, with bulk bins, unattended food being prepped (persimmons, peels, etc.) and various supplies. I'm already paying $38 for 8 slices of Iberico pork shoulder. Why do I have to look at this disconnected, disorganized shit? I'm big on details, and they totally missed this one.\n\nAll in all, if you haven't been, definitely go and check it out, whether you like Chiarello or not. I long for the days when the Bay Area can have true tapas bars that are casual, where one can linger with great drinks and nice tapas to nibble on, instead of the bougie \"tapas restaurants\" we're currently stuck with.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["My husband had the gin and tonic drink and I had the Galleon (", "sp?)", ", both were great, I highly recommend them.

The interior of the restaurant is really interesting and the outside bar area is a great place for cocktails before dinner.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for our reservation and were a little disappointed that they tried to seat us at the bar. Since we made the reservation far in advance and asked if there was a table available, they were nice enough to accommodate but had to wait an extra 35 minutes in the packed bar/tent area.  The outside bar had some of the best and most interesting cocktails I've had. A++ for the conquistador and also high scores for the Revolution. We tried a few others as well and they were good. \n\nAs for food, most of our selections were outstanding but a few were pretty average. We tried the chorizo pinxtos which were fun, bite-sized piece of meat, but at 2.50$ each it's tough to get too many. We also started with the open faced smoked salmon sandwich, a great choice. Another hit was the meatballs. The wood grilled octopus was hit or miss, some in the party loved it, others thought just ok. It wasn't tough, I just think some people don't like octopus. We tried the paella which was a huge portion and it was good to try, but didn't knock our socks off which was a bit of a disappointment. The pork loin dishes are must tries. The pluma is fantastic and has a great sauce with it, but at 38$ for a few bites your left feeling unsatisfied.

The heirloom tomatoes are a nice, sweet complement.\n- Grilled octopus: wonderful charred flavor, tender, served with potatoes\n- Sunny side up egg: with shrimp, potato, and chorizo dressing.  The yolk was nice and runny.. this would be awesome at brunch!\n- Calamari: grilled whole with squid ink aioli and onion jam\n- Gambas: head on, plump and super sweet, great flavor, and it came with toasted bread slices to soak up extra sauce \n- Crispy shrimp: a crisp deep fried pancake with lots I shrimp and topped with a yellow saffron aioli\n- Albondigas: pork and duck meatballs, moist, loved the tart cherry puree on top\n- Mar y montana: open faced iberico and uni sandwich: like an open faced slider, very rich with iberico and uni\n\nLarger dishes:\n- Pluma: pork shoulder, loved the sweet glaze, actually leaner than I expected \n- Paella: sort of had a crust, served in the traditional pan, takes 30-40 min to prepare, so you should order it early on\n\nDesserts:\n- They were able to make me affogato with a blue cheese ice cream, which was awesome \n- I can't really remember the last dessert we got... something with fruit..?  blame it on the drinks\n\nIt's a fun place for a group of 4-6 so that you can share pitchers and try lots of different dishes.

The scallops were set, perfectly cooked, over a tasty sea of tomato-y creamy (but not heavy) rice (also perfectly cooked).  The peas added a nice texture to the dish too.

The service was....cold, a little snide, and dare I say borderline bitchy.  I was really surprised because Coqueta is a nice place and I usually find service in San Francisco to be really great (when thinking of east coast vs west coast service).  But the servers came across as haughty and rude and like they couldn't be bothered to check on us.  Again, I'm not sure if this is a bar vs restaurant situation but if you get bad service at the bar, why would you ever want to come back and eat at the restaurant?  At one point, we asked a server who delivered one of our tapas if we could order an additional dish from her or if we should wait for our original waiter and her tone and response was basically akin to I've kinda got my hands full, don't bother me which was really off putting.  One server was friendly and enthusiastic but after at least 2 servers with attitude, I wasn't really pleased with the service.  As for the drinks, there are a lot of interesting and unique cocktails on the menu.  They are described in vivid detail and I was quite excited to try some of these drinks.  However, I think Coqueta suffers from incredible creative cocktails that I don't think work at all with the food on the menu or maybe even by themselves.  I'm all for trying something new when it comes to cocktail combinations but I don't understand why these two cocktails were even on the menu; the flavors are so overwhelming that I cannot imagine them working well with any of the tapas.  The Dirty by the Sea was a seaweed influenced vodka with a sea anemone and it looked wonderful with the sea anemone but it was so incredibly briny that it tasted exactly like when you go snorkeling and accidentally swallow sea water, it's honestly that salty and briny.  It was overwhelming to the palate and I could only see it working if you ate a plate of boiled potatoes with no seasonings.  I also tried In the Haight which I ordered primarily for the description of its \"patchouli memory\".  I mean, how can you resist a description like that?

With our 7:30pm reservation, the best we could do is get two seats at the bar and I really liked sitting there as opposed to a small two top table because we could see all the cooking going on and you could see some of their handmade Pintxos, otherwise known as bite-size skewers, up close ready to be cooked over a flame.

Both dishes were prepared with such detail, the sunny side up huevo was a rich breakfast dish made especially for dinner and the meatballs were tart yet tasty. For our entree, my dining mate and I decided to split the Lubina a la Brasa which is a wood grilled and semi-boneless Branzino with Manzanilla olive and preserved meyer lemon salsa paired with the Ensalada de Kale which had Lacinto Kale, cana de Cabra, pistachio, tangerine confitura, pickled green strawberries with warm fresh fava and English pea dressing. The branzino was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection and the saltiness of the fish went well with the tartness of the lemon salsa and it paired perfectly with the kale salad. In fact, it was one of the best salads I have ever tasted, yes it was that good.\n\nCoqueta lives up the billing as a unique places for authentic tapas on San Francisco's Embarcadero. For a Saturday night in the freezing cold of winter, the place was packed. We loved sitting on the counter, although we didn't get a great view of the open kitchen, as we literally looked at raw skewers in a glass case, they still had a great energy with all those people inside. It was a little hard to move around but a fun experience nonetheless. I would consider returning for a special occasion as the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get on your dish. But the menu is well-conceived and prepared with a lot of flavor and for that I think Coqueta is the jewel along San Francisco Bay.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-03-31"}, {"excerpts": ["So was the pitcher of Red wine sangria - really balanced flavors and not too sweet.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life.

He said it was the closest flavors to what he experiences in Spain. He lives in Barcelona six months out of the year. My wife and I visited Spain about 17 months ago and fell in love with the people as well as the food. I also cook Spanish food and paella is one of my specialties. With that being said, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I brought my wife and my mom on this special trip. We arrived 16 April on a Saturday shortly after they opened at 11:30am. We didn't have reservations so they sat us in the bar, which is where we usually prefer to sit anyway. The first thing we noticed was the infestation of flies flying overhead. I mean there must have been close to a couple dozen flying in a group. My mother had a hard time getting up on the bar stool and with the flies near us we decided to sit outside on the bench and picnic table where not a single fly bothered us. I immediately ordered the seafood paella since I knew this would take some time to cook. We also ordered one each of white wine and red wine Sangrias. Both were excellent, but the white was my favorite. We started with El Plat Cap a Chef's selection of cured meats. It consisted of house cured chorizo, fu\u00e9t, and Jam\u00f3n Serrano. First of all the portions were minuscule. For $26 I expected a little more on the platter. The slightly larger than a match stick sized and rectangular shaped salami was underwhelming. The chorizo had little flavor, was not bad, but no wow factor. The Jam\u00f3n Serrano was also underwhelming. All three lacked saltiness and more fat content. Next we ordered hot tapas. Patatas Bravas: very good with hints of smokiness and flash fried crisp served with Bravas salsa and garlic aioli, Pulpo a la Parilla: Wood grilled Mediterranean octopus served with fingerling potatoes and piment\u00f3n olive oil which was cooked perfectly. Although we weren't served a single tentacle, which is my favorite part of the octopus, but what was served was very good. Our last tapas was Alb\u00f3ndigas a la feria, duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry Tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot. These were slightly sweet, tart, tender, and moist. Good, but no wow factor here either. Lastly our paella was served. This was probably our biggest disappointment. I am use to saffron in my paella, which is synonymous with paella. Not a hint was detected. Not enough seafood broth was used either. First of all I couldn't detect any flavors of seafood. The paella had primarily tomato based flavors instead. As a result of not enough broth being used. the paella was dry. The clams were cooked nicely, but the shrimp was kind of mushy in texture, not firm. The house cured chorizo lacked flavor and probably did not belong in this dish. It provided a waxy tasteless texture. For $45 this was a huge failure. I had Mexican (Spanish) rice in a Mexican restaurant more flavorful than this.

Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar.

His charm in the kitchen and behind the camera eludes just that, Coqueta. However, in relation to his new Spanish style tapas, it's easy to imagine how this would pertain to his many playful tapas. Having been to Michael Chiarello's Bottega in Yontville several times, this is a step away from his familiar farm to table Italian roots. \n\nAlthough I had planned on visiting Coqueta soon after they opened, I actually ended up walking by during my lunch break. Why not? Since it was in the middle of the day, Michael wasn't there, although one would get a sense of him through the food, open kitchen, and slightly off the norm outside bar area. When you walk through the bar area to go through to the restaurant, you almost feel as if you're being transported from a coastal European bistro, to a secret underground dining club. Not in the literal sense, but once you transport yourself from the bar into the dining area with a small open kitchen, it's as if anything can happen. From the coarse wooded columns to the eccentric wine decanters, it feels like a supper club, anyone would want to immerse themselves into.\n\nI indulged in 4 different tapas. From the cold tapas, I started out with the white gazpacho, and from the hot tapas I chose the crispy shrimp and chickpea flour pancake, the wood-grilled octopus, and grilled albondigas made of duck and pork meatballs with a tart cherry and tempranillo pur\u00e9e.  Every dish was served to perfection. It was an art how each plate was presented in a new and unique way.  The anticipation just continued to grow from dish to dish, but the white gazpacho intrigued me the most.\n\nVisually, the white gazpacho with macron almonds, grapes, syrah reduction and syrah-grapeseed oil was almost too pretty to eat. It was beautifully served in glass, filled about half way with the gazpacho, crowned in an array of color. The gazpacho itself was white, like a blank canvas. The presentation was a visually stunning culinary experience. The surface was painted with a splash of colors from the red wine reduction accompanied by carefully placed drops of golden oil. And finally, the center of the gazpacho was strewn with almonds adorned with a delicate, edible yellow flower. The flavor profile was equally enticing. The cold, velvety consistency of the gazpacho itself was delicate and light. The flavor was unique, combining a soft balance between savory and sweet. Hiding at the bottom of the gazpacho were thinly sliced grapes that added a sweet bite that balanced out the marcona profile.

My anticipation was at effervescing level by the time Sunday rolled around. I'd walked by the place twice, peering into to catch a glimpse of something. \n\nI'm so excited, that I make my dining partner arrive 15 minutes early for our 9:15 reservation. Oh, those sweet fates; our table had just been set up. Only when they led us through from the bar, did I realize that actual restaurant was larger than just the space I'd been trying to see. I had been looking just the bar side. The bigger space takes up the former LaFitte space. And it's gorgeous.\n\nNow, believe me, I'm not a gusher. I'm usually not  impressed by celebrity. (There is a point to this). I'm sitting perusing the menu thinking \"It would be kind of great if Michael Chiarello was actually here tonight. But it's late and Sunday...I doubt it\". The words are still hanging in my bourbon-infused airspace when a hand is thrust into my menu's general area. \"Good evening and welcome.\" It is Chef Chiarello personally thanking me and my dinner guest for coming tonight. I regale him of my anticipation and ask what he suggests. He patiently and graciously reviews a number of items he suggests, including the Tatta tots \"They are a pain in the ass to make, but they're delicious\". It is only after he has left the table, that my guest leans in and says \"you just peed a little, didn't you?\". I am loathe to admit, I did. He also communicates that I have asked the chef what he recommends while the menu CLEARLY says \"Here's what the chef recommends\".  Tourist.\n\nAfter our incredibly lovely server brings us a bottle of Spanish rose, we begin to think about tucking in. The Chef had recommended the iberico pork, so that was already settled, but we reviewed the list of his recommendations. Here's how they played out: \n\n* Asparagus with sangria hollandaise: Mother of Pearl, this was good. I know what you're thinking. Sangria? Hollandaise? Believe me. It works. The hollandaise is light, fluffy and so balanced. It's not sweet, but has the perfect note of red wine. \n* Tattas Brava: Fancy schmancy tater tots. Creamy, crispy with some aioli. Fantastic\n* Chicken/Spring pea croquetas: Gorgeous, crispy. Like a chicken pot pie in finger-food form. \n* Crispy egg over shrimp and polenta with chorizo sauce: hands down my favorite. A perfect sunny-side up egg, shrimp and spicy chorizo. This could possibly the last meal I ask for. \n* Grilled iberico pork: Just typing this makes my mouth water. Simply put, this is one of the best things I've ever tasted. Apparently, these porcine pals are fed a diet of acorns, making them taste like nothing I've tasted; the perfect grilling didn't hurt, either! \n\nService was without a flaw. Attentive, yet non-intrusive; always knowledgeable. I get the distinct impression that people actually like working there. Everyone seems relaxed and really enthused over what they're doing. \n\nMy bill came and I actually thought it was a mistake. No, hold on. In a  good way.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life.

Located north of the Ferry Building along the Embarcadero, the restaurant has a bar and dining area in an outside covered patio.  The main dining room also has a bar counter in front of the open kitchen.  We were seated here and had a nice view of the kitchen staff preparing the various dishes.  \n\nOur server welcomed us and since this was our first visit, he gave a run-down on how the dishes were laid out in the menu.

Had this is Spain and ever time dining at Spanish restaurants here. It's simply the tastiest cured meat. \n\nCroquetas de Pollo - 3 skewers of Chicharron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured seasonal citrus. You complement the croqueta with the citrus.  It looked simple, but it was delicious.  \n\nPatatas Bravas - 12 lightly smoked, crispy potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic aioli.   I love potatoes and this was an interesting creation.  They were lightly coated, fried and topped with a dap of aioli. I liked it without dipping it into the salsa. \n\nSalmon Ahumado - 2 smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey on bread. Generous amount of salmon on each bread.  Though this might not appear t to be a Spanish dish, it was never the less, quite tasty.   \n\nPluma - acorn fed Spanish Iberico de Bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze.  Wow! The Iberico was so moist and tasty.  I could have eaten a lot more of this. \n\nChurros \"Fantasia\" - 4 crispy Spanish doughnuts with drinking chocolate and mixed berry powder.  You dunk your square shaped churros into the chocolate, which was not think or overly sweet. You can dap some concentrated berry powder on it for a contrasting taste. \n\nThis was one of the best Spanish meals that I've had Stateside where the tapas reminded me of ones I had in Spain.

Really. \n\nDetails to follow, but first, a couple of quick tips. First, know that it's best to make reservations weeks ahead. We went on a rainy weekday and it was packed. Second, know that if you can't get a table, everything on the menu is available at the bar or outside on the small patio in front. \n\nLet's start with the ambience. It's busy, fairly noisy but I had no trouble hearing my companions. Great vibe and we loved the decor, clean and warm. Notice the painting on the wall which used cracks and such to make animals and figures in the Spanish theme. \n\nService was great. Our server was available whenever we needed her and knew the menu items perfectly. \n\nNot an inexpensive place but for food this good, on the wharf, and this well known, it was very reasonable. We ordered a lot, stayed for a couple of hours, and left for about $75 each -- with 12 items plus drinks, dessert, coffee (for five people). Portions are quite decent -- you certainly do not need to sample as many as we did! You could have a very nice meal for $40 each. \n\nOK, the food. Ahhh, the food! Overall, every dish was at least good and most were excellent, with several standouts. Flavors were complex but never muddled, everything was prepared perfectly, and the balance of interesting flavors was flawless. Start with top-quality Spanish ingredients like iberian ham and overlay the smoky, hot touch from their open fire grill, sauce it right, and you get the idea. If you appreciate the design of a perfect bite, you will be delighted and surprised in dish after dish. \n\nHighlights:\n\nThe charcuterie plate is amazing. A $38 splurge but a fair value, with probably a dozen meats and cheeses, everything top quality. \n\nIberico lardo served atop sea urchin roe (uni). Wow. Had this again on my second visit and it was even better than I remembered. The uni melds with the hot, smoky fat from the lardo so it doesn't taste particularly like unit -- instead you get the creamy texture, the richness, the fresh umami, and an afterrush of briny sea. This is such a perfect bite.\n\nPatatas bravas are tiny potatoes (\"freshly dug,\" says the menu in a rare bit of ostentation), coated and fried to be crispy shelled and creamy inside, served in a ring with a wonderful salsa in the middle and topped with aioli. \n\nCurly mustard and chard with plumped raisins, pine nuts, and a caper-raisin puree. Bitter greens and sweet bits for balance. Rather oily but I liked it that way. \n\nShrimp served with crispy potato garlic chips and a sunny-side up egg: Mix it all up before serving.\n\nI was blown away with the seemingly-simple smoked salmon made spectacular with truffled honey! Truffles and honey did not seem like the perfect pairing that it was. Smart.\n\nAnother surprise was the chicharron-crusted chicken which was bursting with juiciness, meaty and bold. Served with lively citrus skewers.\n\nOh, and the albondigas (meatballs). I love ordering albondigas because it's fun to say, all the better when they're so rich and meaty. Duck and pork with crispy shallots and a rich sauce.\n\nSave room, because the desserts are terrific. \n\nFlan del rey with caramelized apple pur\u00e9e, sherry-poached little spheres of apple with blue cheese. Whoa. \n\nSpanish brandy ice cream with hot espresso pour on top.\n\nAnd this was amazing: Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche: Warm molten arroz con leche cake with huckleberries and arroz con leche ice cream. The huckleberries, reduced to a jam, were a standout to me, playing off the cream and the cake, richly fruity. \n\nEven the coffee was standout-rich. \n\nOh, and I almost forgot the cocktails. Love a cocktail that has a blend of ingredients so well-balanced that the flavors are distinct but it's hard to identify what's there. The one I loved the best was De Copas con Dali with white vermouth, campari, orange, lemon, cava rose. And on my second visit, there was another cocktail from bourbon finished with mint that was great; sorry I don't have better notes on this one. \n\nWell, if you read this far, thank you.

She was fantastic, friendly, and funny with a great sense of humor.  So, after looking at the menu, it was time to dig into the ordering.\n\nSeveral at the table decided to share a set of dishes and three others (including me) decided to order our own set to share.\n\nDISHES:\n\nEl Gran Plat Cap which is the chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses served with homemade membrillo, Marcona almond, extra virgin olive oil torta, pan de crista and tomaquet.  The plate came with a generous amount of cheeses (3 types) and 3 different means including some salumi and sausage which was slightly spicy with great lingering flavor.  Put some of the goat cheese or blue cheese on a piece of that spicy sausage and your mouth would water in excitement. Good for 3-4 to share but only a few bites of each.  If you love this and have 5-6 people I would order two of these.\n\nCroquetas de Pollo which is Chicharron crusted chicken and English Pea Croquetas with cured citrus (tangelo).  This was a great dish with that crisp Chicarron outer crispy exterior which when eaten breaks into that soft and hot center with the chicken and English pea filling.  Came 6 to the order so this could be shared by at least 3-4 people.\n\nThe most unique dish of the evening was the \"Sunny Side-Up\" huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts, Chile de Arbol, and chorizo dressing. This was WOW in your mouth.  Everything was mixed together (see my video) by the server and then turned over for consumption...very fast consumption I may add.  This is a do not miss dish!\n\nGambas Negras was the next dish which was ordered by the other group at the table. This was olive oil poached head on gulf prawns with black garlic and chile sauce. This was outstanding as I did taste this as well.  Very rich in flavor and not too heavy on the garlic but just enough to push the flavor through the entire shrimp.\n\nAlbondiga a la Feria was next up which were the duck and pork meatballs. DUCK? PORK? MEATBALL?  YEEESSSSSS!!!!!!  This was an interesting meat ball. Not very firm yet very flavorful. Pick this one up with your finger or slide your fork under each because sticking it will lead to them being broken.  A good dish but it wasn't my favorite, but worth a try for sure.\n\nFAVORITE DISH:\n\nPulpo a la Parrilla. This was wood grilled Mediterranean Octopus, with fresh fingerling potoatos and Pimenton Olive Oil.  I get octopus whenever I can especially when I can get a big fat tentacle with a little charring going on. This is exactly what we got.  You could cut this with a fork barely pressing down it was so tender.  The flavor here with the wood smoke impregnated throughout ever piece of the octopus was fantastic. This was definitely my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nTo finish for the evening, we decided to get an order of the Churro's with drinking Mexican Chocolate.  To the guy who sat next to me with his girlfriend (if he reads this), thanks again for sharing those Churro's.  He insisted we take the two they weren't going to eat and so we tried them.  After trying them we had to order a full order for the table. Dipping that Churro into the Mexican chocolate was heavenly but picking up the chocolate and drinking it to the finish was an awesome way to finish off with an espresso.

The pickled mustard seed added a nice tang, and I really enjoyed it.

The potatoes were good, but I wish there was more octopus!\n\nPluma- Acorn fed, Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze- This was another highlight of the night. The pork shoulder was medium rare and it was so juicy, tender, and flavorful. I was shocked at how fantastic this dish was! Possibly the best pork shoulder I've had. The honey chili glaze added a really nice sweet touch to it, and I was surprised at how well it went together. Damn.. wish I had some more of this!\n\nSetas al ajillo- Wild and cultivated mushrooms with garlic, chilli and sherry- Great compliment to the pork dish. I love mushrooms, and this was yummy!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the small bites at $4 which were super cute.\n\nManchego cheesecake with caramel popcorn- Super interesting.. it tasted like manchego cheese but in cheesecake form. I liked the outer coating and the popcorn that went with it as well.\n\nPan con chocolate, ice cream sandwich with olive oil ice cream- I love olive oil ice cream, and this dish did not disappoint! I would recommend ordering this.\n\nI had a phenomenal experience at Croqueta, as the food, service, and decor was spectacular. I'm so glad I decided to eat here as I now know how delicious this restaurant is! Will be back the next time around hopefully to try the other dishes that are available.

Subtle flavors but still very good.  \n\npulpo a la parilla: grilled octopus was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.  They were tender and definitely not chewy or hard in a bad way.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life.

After fellow yelper, Rodney's review, I knew this was a must pit stop while in SF. I was in luck when I got reservation!\n\nWe got there early and was seated in a room that is adjacent to the actual dining area, this area has the bar and a few seats where people sat and drank as well. We ordered a drink to start the night, the Kalimotxo which has Mexican Coke, Red Sangria, and Cinnamon. This drink was full of flavor but resides a bit on the dry side. It is only served in a party pitcher (500 mL). \n\nWe were shown to our seats promptly, matter of fact, 10 minutes before our actual reservation time.  Our server, Lowell was AWESOME from the beginning. He is very knowledgeable of all the amazing food and drinks Coqueta serves. After we looked at the menu and made our choices, he picked and chose the order of our food and he was spot on! \n\nUnfortunately, I really wanted to try the \"Mar y Montana\", but they were sold out of the sea urchin (this gives me the perfect excuse to come back!).\n\nThe patatas bravas (freshly dug, crispy new potatoes, lightly smoked, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli). It was flavorful and the potatoes are perfect bite size pieces. The garlic alioli and salsa help brought out the flavor of the smoked potatoes. There was a great balance of salty and sweet.\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas (served alongside with cured cara-cara orange) (3 pieces). These puppies were like mini pot pies, bursting with richness in flavor! Super creamy and packed with great seasoning. The cured orange was served alongside with the croquetas, but I didn't try them. \n\nGambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on Gulf prawns with black garlic and chili). This was an amazing dish. Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert.

Then, there was Ryan Scott. He was taking my order at his food truck when I got tongue tied and blurted something that wasn't even on the menu. When I went to his pop-up restaurant, I sat there mesmerized. Like a Kelly Kapowski-Jeff crush, I had a silly grin on my face while batting my lashes the entire time during brunch as he sat at the table next to us. \n\nAnd, then there's Michael Chiarello. I grew up watching him along with Yan Can Cook on PBS and followed him on the Food Network while rooting for him on Top Chef Masters and The Next Iron Chef. He's like the Richard Gere in the foodie world with a charismatic personality that's super lovable. So naturally, when I read he was opening a new restaurant in SF, I JUST had to go.\n\nAlthough Chef Chiarello specializes in Italian influenced Californian cuisine, his new baby, Coqueta focuses on Basque cuisine (Spanish tapas). Considering it's located in a prime real estate location, expect prices to be high because you're paying for the ambiance and the waterfront view after all. The menu is quite extensive with small bites, cold tapas, hot tapas, and larger family style plates: http://www.scribd.com/doc/136022919/Coqueta-Final-Opening-Menu. Two to three dishes per a person is recommended but portions are small so if you have a large appetite, definitely skip the skewers and open faced sandwiches (they can easily rack up $$$) and get a rice or pasta dish as a filler.   \n\nThere was some mixed reviews so we were conservative with our order. I'm glad we didn't over-order as we usually do because the food was good but not as spectacular as Lolinda and Contigo (my two favorite higher end tapas restaurants in SF).

The croquettes which were like fried pieces of chicken pot pie; super mouthwatering with a decadent creaminess. As one of my favorite cuts of meat, the pork shoulder was rich, fatty, and full of intense porkiness. I absolutely adored the glass honey jar it was presented with. The vineyard greens were a good dose of fiber with a lovely sweetness from the raisins and the nutty crunch from the pine nuts. The chorizo was like cold salami chunks and the too smoky octopus needed a citrus punch so skip these. And, while the smoked salmon open faced sammie was delectable, $5 was excessive for an amuse bouche sized sammie. Dessert was wildly creative. The sangria popsicle with nostalgic pop rocks definitely won me over the too pungent manchego cheesecake pops.  \n\nS E R V I C E\nMichelin-star quality service, the genuinely warm staff are well-seasoned and run a tight ship.

We were seated at a long table along a window.  It was relatively comfortable, but it was a bit of a struggle getting up on the bench by the window.  The table is set really close to the bench, and if I was just one month more pregnant (or on the heftier side), I don't think I would have been able to squeeze through onto the bench.  The high chairs on the other side of the table were also a bit awkward.

I admit my value perception may be a bit tainted by the fact my preggers state meant I couldn't enjoy any of the cured meats or the manchego cheese since it was made with raw goat's milk.  I loved the Valdeon blue cheese, but it overpowered my palette, so I couldn't really taste any distinctive flavor with the Cana de Cabra soft goat cheese.\n\nCrispy Shrimp & Chickpea Flour Pancake - I love all things deep fried, and this did not disappoint.  I like my citrus, so I probably would have enjoyed a bit more of the roaster meyer lemon to squeeze on top.\n\nWood Grilled Octopus - Super tender (not overcooked and rubbery), well-seasoned, and a delightful recommendation from someone else that insisted we order it.\n\nDuck & Pork Albondigas and Beef Shortribs - Both good, but unremarkable.\n\nIf I come again, I'd skip the Apple and Pear Ensalada and Patatas Bravas.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-01-29"}, {"excerpts": ["- Baby beets, cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la plancha - OK.\n"], "author": "Manda Bear B.", "review": "****************************** REVIEW 858 *******************************\n\n         The former spot of Lafitte, now home of the hottest tapas spot by the water Coqueta of Napa Valley celeb chef Michael Chiarello.

It's sure to be a long-standing hit in San Francisco as Michael Chiarello knows how to orchestrate a wonderfully tasty menu of Spanish tapas in an elegant setting with a strong cooking team and servers.\n\nWe were lucky to be seated at the counter in front of the kitchen as the chef and his team turned out dish after dish, meal after meal impeccably.  I couldn't stop staring at Michael Chiarello as I was totally star-struck!  But we got to drink wine with him through these hand-crafted glass thinly fluted flasks (I was a little scared because you have to hold it up at an angle while it thinly streams to your mouth, it was red wine, I had a white cardigan on, you get the picture - but I did fine, woo!).  He gave us good food choice recommendations and we chatted a bit (nevertheless, I was still star-struck and could not staring at him, ha!).  \n\nWe ordered a number of small dishes, but these were the definite highlights of the night:\n\n* Sunny Side-Up Egg with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizo dressing\n\n*  Grilled Razor Clams with meyer lemon and wild ramps\n\n*  Cured Cod Crudo with tomato fresco, hearts of palm, arugula, and whole citrus dressing\n\nClassy great-tasting dishes with that extra touch of something special.

I make tons of reservations on Open Table, and I made my first Coqueta reservation on a Thursday evening at 5:30.  I checked OT that morning and yes, it was still there and confirmed.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the hostess said she did not see my reservation and that she saw that I supposedly changed it to the following Thursday.  No, no I didn't.  After \"investigating\" for a full second, she threw her hands up like there was nothing she could do and when my full party arrived that she could try to fit me in for a table but it would be a 45 minute wait (she cancelled the switched reservation for the following Thursday, I knew there must've been some kind of mistake and she probably cancelled somebody else's reservation).  \n\nWhat?  Unheard of.  My friend was late so it wasn't like I could argue yet.  When she arrived, I explained my situation to a kind waitress who then went back to the hostess and then came back with the same answer.  I was already thinking about what I was going to write in my Yelp review regarding this.  But then! - the manager came up to me and apologized, said our drinks while we were waiting for our table were complimentary as a restaurant staff member had inavertently changed my reservation for someone who coincidentally had my same last name.  I guess there is some way that they can track changes made on OT.  So, the manager got us our awesome seating in front of Michael Chiarello and all was forgotten as I appreciated how he handled the situation and took the time to see what actually happened.  But!  I hope that hostess learns from this and realizes how unprofessional she was.  People remember how good the food was, but bad service, including *bad hostessing*, kind of stays with you longer.  Also, I had to follow up with OT to receive my 100 points for my reservation since she cancelled it in the system.  \n\nOther than that whole experience, I would give Coqueta 5 stars for the food, the manager who handled the situation well and for Mr. Chiarello of course!!

So, naturally, I have higher expectations for what I want when I go out to eat and drink, especially since I work around 60 hours a week and NEVER have time to go out. \n\nLast night, Sunday, a friend recommended I go to Coqueta for a very special dinner I had planned. I typically shy away from the Embarcadero for anything at all, but figured I would give it a try. \n\nIn open table, I left a notation in the reservation statg how special the night was, why and that I also worked in restaurants, so I was expecting, given how wonderful Bottega is, that this place would live up to the hype. \n\nSadly, I was gravely mistaken. First, neither the host, the server, any manager or any person at all mentioned my special night, not one bit. I even tried to tell our waitress about it, but she simply talked over me, saying to order a 19$ glass of Not Champagne. \nThen, still no acknowledgement of my night or anything, our preliminary order is taken and we proceed. \n\nOur server told us that the House cured Jamon Serrano came with around 7 slices, and that we should upgrade by adding, with outrageous sur charge of course, the Manchego. Let me just say, while the flavors were great, we recieved 3 slices of Jamon, and when we mentioned it, the server simply walked away, with ZERO mention of the mistake. \n\nThen, Croquets. Again, solid flavors, and a great counter point was the supremed citrus, beatifully sweet, sour and savory combo here. However, in each of the 3 (very small portions) there was a small, completely inedible part of the croquet that was as hard as a rock. Almost cracked a tooth! As an aside, they didnt quite understand the concept of clearing before bringing more plates. Had to stack them ourselves.\n\nNext, the uni and jamon lardo open faced \"sandwitch\", again, all the flavors were there, but it was ruined by how crunchy (near inedible) the mini bagel looking thing could have been a great combo if it was soft and maybe a little salty. But alas, another great idea, poorly executed. \n\nLastly, the pulpo or grilled octopus. This was the one bright spot. Not a single problem with this dish. Absolutely perfect. \n\nAll things considered, food could be much better.

But you're in San Francisco should this is the new reality and with a stunning destination like the reclaimed Pier that Coqueta makes its home, you better believe you are paying for the ambiance in addition to the food they serve. I went to Coqueta only once before, when Chef Michael Chiarello first opening his newest jewel a few years ago and I remembered seeing him cook in the small open kitchen and then walk around and greet his diners. Those days are long gone, but what isn't gone is the large crowds that arrive night in and night out. \n\nThis time around, a friend asked where would I like to eat, and knowing it was a Saturday night, and I was taking BART across the bay, one of the easiest places to get a unique meal was back at Coqueta. With a 7:30pm reservation in hand, we made our way there, once again forgetting that their small entrance is right where the glass of their interior bar meets the cement blocks of where their main dining room and open kitchen resides. With our 7:30pm reservation, the best we could do is get two seats at the bar and I really liked sitting there as opposed to a small two top table because we could see all the cooking going on and you could see some of their handmade Pintxos, otherwise known as bite-size skewers, up close ready to be cooked over a flame. And judging by the size of those small little skewers we already knew we did not want to order those!\n\nBut first we knew we were deciding on cocktails as the bar makes some of the most unique drinks along the bay, with mojitos and margaritas in check filled with lots of visually tantalizing things like edible wildflowers you couldn't go wrong. My dining companion wanted something summery and was thrilled with the price of their Sangria made with red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile and local apples at 9 dollars a glass you couldn't beat this house recipe. I was looking for something more exotic, so I decided to go with the Beso de Carca made with Pueblo Viejo Blanco, lime, raspberry-jalapeno sugar Rose \"Air\" it was a smooth and spicy cocktail that went down just right at an affordable 12 dollars a glass.\n\nFor our dinner, they have a lot of choices on the menu at Coqueta that perfectly encompass what it's like to dine in Spain, from sliced cured meats to Iberian cheeses to Pintxos otherwise known as bite-size skewers they seem to be a fully realized concept that takes you to Spain and back. From their Hot Tapas menu we decided to go with the \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts and topped with chili de arbol and chorizo dressing and the Albondigas a la Feria which were duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots. Both dishes were prepared with such detail, the sunny side up huevo was a rich breakfast dish made especially for dinner and the meatballs were tart yet tasty. For our entree, my dining mate and I decided to split the Lubina a la Brasa which is a wood grilled and semi-boneless Branzino with Manzanilla olive and preserved meyer lemon salsa paired with the Ensalada de Kale which had Lacinto Kale, cana de Cabra, pistachio, tangerine confitura, pickled green strawberries with warm fresh fava and English pea dressing. The branzino was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection and the saltiness of the fish went well with the tartness of the lemon salsa and it paired perfectly with the kale salad. In fact, it was one of the best salads I have ever tasted, yes it was that good.\n\nCoqueta lives up the billing as a unique places for authentic tapas on San Francisco's Embarcadero. For a Saturday night in the freezing cold of winter, the place was packed. We loved sitting on the counter, although we didn't get a great view of the open kitchen, as we literally looked at raw skewers in a glass case, they still had a great energy with all those people inside. It was a little hard to move around but a fun experience nonetheless. I would consider returning for a special occasion as the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get on your dish.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life.

I ordered the \"Dirty by the Sea\" martini, and the server immediately remarked, 'you know, it's very briny.\" I should have heeded his warning, as the drink, while beautiful, was essentially like drinking seawater. Is this drink intended to be enjoyed, or even consumed (I literally imagined a scorecard in back where they track who actually orders/drinks this drink). I ended up finishing it for the sake of my own pride, not in the least bit to complement any of our food (what goes with seaweed juice anyway?). My sister tried \"In the Haight,\" which had far too many strong, complex flavors going on to truly appreciate it. Thumbs down on the drinks.

They were out of uni, so we couldn't try the lardo/uni open-face sandwich. The chicken croquets and \"fantasia de fideua\" were nice and flavorful. The smoked salmon open-face sandwich was tasty, but my sister pointed it out it was much like eating a fancy bagel (the montaditos are curiously served atop what are akin to mini-bagels). Anchovy skewers, pimientos de pardon and the trio of grilled sausages were just ok. Sideways thumbs on the food.\n\nThe service - ugh - was on the brusque side. If it was possible for a server to smirk simultaneously at you and your order, that happens here.\n\nI was expecting robust (perhaps even unique) flavors and tempting bites that left me wanting more.

However, I thought the other things I tried were good but not really noteworthy (boquerones, salmon and truffle honey open faced sandwich, sausage, and pimientos).  \n\nThe areas where this place really disappointed were in the service and the cocktails. The service was....cold, a little snide, and dare I say borderline bitchy.  I was really surprised because Coqueta is a nice place and I usually find service in San Francisco to be really great (when thinking of east coast vs west coast service).  But the servers came across as haughty and rude and like they couldn't be bothered to check on us.  Again, I'm not sure if this is a bar vs restaurant situation but if you get bad service at the bar, why would you ever want to come back and eat at the restaurant?  At one point, we asked a server who delivered one of our tapas if we could order an additional dish from her or if we should wait for our original waiter and her tone and response was basically akin to I've kinda got my hands full, don't bother me which was really off putting.  One server was friendly and enthusiastic but after at least 2 servers with attitude, I wasn't really pleased with the service.  As for the drinks, there are a lot of interesting and unique cocktails on the menu.  They are described in vivid detail and I was quite excited to try some of these drinks.  However, I think Coqueta suffers from incredible creative cocktails that I don't think work at all with the food on the menu or maybe even by themselves.  I'm all for trying something new when it comes to cocktail combinations but I don't understand why these two cocktails were even on the menu; the flavors are so overwhelming that I cannot imagine them working well with any of the tapas.  The Dirty by the Sea was a seaweed influenced vodka with a sea anemone and it looked wonderful with the sea anemone but it was so incredibly briny that it tasted exactly like when you go snorkeling and accidentally swallow sea water, it's honestly that salty and briny.  It was overwhelming to the palate and I could only see it working if you ate a plate of boiled potatoes with no seasonings.  I also tried In the Haight which I ordered primarily for the description of its \"patchouli memory\".  I mean, how can you resist a description like that?  However, the only memory that lingered was the smoky flavor of my vodka that while not as off putting as the Dirty by the Sea, it was still so strong that it bordered on palate destroying.  I felt like someone locked me in a meat smoker after drinking this thing.  I really don't understand the place of such strong drinks on a menu filled with pretty flavorful tapas.  \n\nEven though the food was probably a three star experience, I was so disappointed by the service and the cocktails that I have to give this a two star review because I was really excited to try this place due to the stellar reviews and this was a real let down for me.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-12-29"}], "the castro": [{"excerpts": ["Highlights for me were the Castro and Spanish Holiday-- "], "author": "Andrea H.", "review": "Every time I walk or run along the Embarcadero I make a mental note to snag a reservation.

We picked a few hot plates to share and decided to skip the cold snack style plates.  \n\nThe octopus and fingerling potatoes were cooked to near perfection.  I commented that the dish could have had more salt, but of course that's an easy fix.  The patatas bravas are essentially uber fancy homemade potato chips.  They were a nice break in the action before the next plate!  The grilled steak (I believe this was a chef special, not a mainstay on the menu) was juicy, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfect medium rare. The verdure a la catalana salad accompanied the steak dish very well.  We finished our meal with the apple pie dessert.  The pie is not a traditional pie slice, rather a small tart.  Nonetheless, the treat was a sweet finish to a fascinating meal.  \n\nI also must mention the drinks!  Ah, the drinks, the glorious drinks!

I started with the pinxto which are these small bar bites that were recommended highly. I ordered all 5 that were available since I wanted to try everything. My two favorite were probably the one with the quail egg because it had this great flavor and felt bigger than the other bites and the chorizo with artichokes and peppers. The other three weren't bad, just not my favorites. \n\nI ended up getting two more tapas since the above were really just 5 small bites. I got the meatballs and the croquetas based on the suggestions of yelp. The meatballs were so delicious. After having these meatballs that were mostly made with duck and some pork now I realize I must have all meatballs that have duck in it. It's so juicy and the little bit of cherry salsa they had on top was such a great counterpoint to cut into the fattiness. The croquetas were mini chicken pot pies and I've had some bad ones before but these were so good. Breaded and fried, the inside was still so moist and had a bit of that chicken pot pie broth that everyone loves. \n\nI ended up having to get dessert because the churros just looked so good. The kitchen staff/my waitress was so sweet and also gave me two additions (the strawberry gelatina and the manchego cheesecake with caramel popcorn). They were interesting and the strawberry was definitely my favorite. I'm all for mixing a bit of savory into my sweet but the cheese in the cheesecake bite was just slightly too pungent for me.

Seeing as we always enjoy ourselves at Bottega I couldn't wait to try out Coqueta! And it being his take on tapas was a major plus as I've been to Spain and absolutely adore Spanish cuisine. My friend was leaving for Cabo that weekend so we decided to have lunch before she left. I made reservations for 3 through opentable for a late lunch at 2:00pm on Friday the 28th of February. \nWe arrived just before 2 and stood around awkwardly for about 4 minutes. We didn't know if we should ask the at least 4 people who walked by if there was anyone who could seat us. I understand it's not a server's job to seat customers but it would have been nice if one of them would have let someone know there were people waiting in the front. At last, a man came and uninvitingly asked if he could help I said yes I had reservations. He immediately found my name on his computer and I confirmed that was us. He told us he'd check if our table was set up yet. We waited a while longer and we're then lead to a table and given menus. Now comes the most uncomfortable part. We sat there for about 8 mins without ANYONE coming to our table to greet us, ask if we had questions, wanted anything to drink and I kept track because it just got plain old ridiculous. We all sat there in amazement as servers, hosts, and MANAGERS walked past us and just had to laugh because what else can you really do without getting angry and ruining what was supposed to be a great lunch with friends. I understand we look young and we are but really, is it acceptable for a restaurant of such stature to be treating customers like this? There was a server who was helping a table RIGHT next to us (the tables are very close together so its not like he didn't see us) and he wouldn't even look at us as he brought out a plate for his table, came back to take their dessert order, AND bring them a to go box. Now I've worked at a restaurant before and usually everyone helps each other out. If a server doesn't realize they've got a new table or forgets about a table another will help them out and at least let them know. A runner came over and peered into my glass, seeing that it was empty he asks confused if I wanted water. Oh finally someone realizes we exist! Yes, thank you. Some time later our waitress (Sara G., I only know because it says on my receipt) arrives and doesn't even apologize, which is fine, it wasn't like she was helping the table to our left, the whole time or anything! She asks if we've ever been here before and we all say no and she starts to explain to us what tapas is and by this point my friend is very annoyed and was like why is she talking to us like that, acting like we don't know what tapas is! She was very unenthusiastic and you could tell she wasn't thrilled she had us as a table. Anyways we ordered the jam\u00f3n serrano and manchego skewers, roasted Padron peppers, calamari, wood-grilled octopus and the chorizo sandwiches as well as the Castro and another cocktail with cava in it to drink. Standouts were the calamari and octopus. My bf never eats seafood but we convinced him to try the octopus and he was shocked at how good it was . Everything else was alright. My friend liked her drink and mine was fine but I had seen pictures of it before on yelp served with a skewer of colorful fruit but it arrived with a limp carrot slice in it which visually was unappetizing (honestly, we all laughed at how gross it looked). My friend ordered the croquetas because she saw the group next to us get them and had to have them. She didn't know what they were called and I couldn't see what she was pointing to to help her out and the waitress annoyingly said they were the chicken and pea croquetas as if my friend should have known. jam\u00f3n croquetas were my favorite tapas in Barcelona so I knew these would not live up to them, and of course they did not. By this time my friend wanted to order another drink and we knew they are known for their gin and tonics so she was waiting for our waitress to come by to order the barca. She made herself scarce and after failing to flag her down my friend eventually asked the guy pouring our water \"can I just order a drink from you?\" Yeah, we had to from the bus boy. We ordered dessert, mine was whatever but my friend kept raving about the manchego cheesecake pops saying they were THE best thing she had ever tasted. The bill came out to just under $120 after both taxes and we left undeserving Sara a $20 tip with hopes that she will treat everyone with the respect they deserve and not discriminate based on age.\nI'm giving Coqueta one star because I have been a loyal customer to chef Chiarello's restaurants and the way we were treated was absolutely unacceptable!

Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert. I had to sneak a photo op! They said it was really good.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-03-27"}, {"excerpts": ["but I heard that the Porron kalimotxo is fun to pass around!

"], "author": "Michelle W.", "review": "Coqueta has been on the top of my list for a long time now.  On a spontaneous sunny Saturday, we were walking our dog in the area and decided to stop by for a mid-day snack.\n\nSince we had a dog with us, our only option was to sit outside at one of two available communal tables.  There were tons of bussers coming and going to refill water, but our server was nowhere to be found.  It took us almost 30 minutes to find our server so we decided to order everything at once, knowing they might not be back until we were ready to pay. [minus 1 star for slow service]\n\nWhat we got:\n\nKalimotxo - Sangria mixed with coke and cinnamon that comes in a Spanish party pitcher.  The coke made it bubbly, which was a refreshing spin on the typical sangria.\n\nBite Sized Skewers - the menu says \"offered at tableside\", which we found out later, meant that they will pre-make a bunch of skewers and bring you the whole board to pick out the skewers you want.  I don't prefer it served this way, since I feel like the food isn't as fresh when it's been \"chillin\" on the board for who knows how long.  The 5 skewer options were: house cured boquerones, chorizo, jamon serrano, tortilla de espinacas, huevos de codorniz.  My favorite was  the tortilla de espinacas because the cana de cabra cheese was delicious.  \n\nSunny Side-Up Huevo - this dish BLEW MY SOCKS OFF, we were shamelessly scraping the very last bits off the plate.  The dish comes with 4 medium sized shrimps, crispy potato strings, a sunny-side egg and chorizo dressing.  The chorizo dressing, which is basically chorizo oil with crumbled chorizo, really makes the dish.   After combining the egg and the potato, the dish is spicy marriage of flavors and textures.\n\nAround 5pm, the sun was beginning to wane, and the pier suddenly got REALLY windy and cold.  My advice would be to find seating indoors if you're able to.  Overall, the food was pretty good, I wouldn't say the skewers lived up to the hype, but I'd come back for the egg dish.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-29"}, {"excerpts": ["but it was good, and I recommend it given that this place does not seem to know what kalimotxo is.

I had heard good things from Coqueta, and it had 4 stars, but to be honest, I have had better spanish food in the worst tourist traps in Spain than here.\n\nChef Dominick Maietta clearly has no idea about spanish cuisine, and as a spaniard I found some of the food in this place culturally offensive.\n\nI should have known better when I saw what they consider \"paella\". The moment you see chorizo as a paella ingredient you know that you are not in the right place, but in one of those that thinks that yellow rice with multiple meats and seafoods is paella. However, I thought that if I avoided the paella and just order tapas it would be ok. I was mistaken.\n\nThe pintxos are what I would call a scam. If chef Dominick Maietta has never tried them at least he could google them, and he would see that they are served over bread. $2.5 for a boiled quail egg and a piece of pepper without bread, is not just a scam, is simply disgusting. If he had ever visited a restaurant in Spain he would also know that the moment you sit down, there should be bread on the table.\n\nThe \"house cured\" serrano ham gives bad name to what serrano ham should be. It was really bland, with not enough taste and the texture was too soft. By the way, you do not put pepper on serrano ham.\n\nOne of the most surprising failures in the menu was the Pan con tomate. This is a traditional snack that even as a little children I could prepare by myself. You take a piece of bread, toast it, you rub half a tomato into it, add olive oil and salt, and you got it. Simple, cheap and delicious!... apparently even that is too complicated for the chef. His concept of pan con tomate is bringing a piece of toasted bread and a little bowl of what looks like a can tomato sauce.\n\nThe octopus was ok, slightly overcooked, and way too small for a $14 tapa, but given the previous failures I was happy to have something decent.\n\nThe bikini was good, again a bit too small, but tasty and warm. I did enjoy it while it lasted.\n\nThe sangria is decent, I like them a bit more juicy but it was good, and I recommend it given that this place does not seem to know what kalimotxo is.

My husband and I received a very warm greeting as soon as we arrived. We sat in the bar area, and we had constant attention from various staff when it came to ordering/refilling of water cups/asking for more drinks/etc. \n\nWhat's also good: the decor. The bar area where we sat had some great seating, and I really appreciated that my bar chair had a back to lean on, as I noticed some people were using stools, which probably would not be as comfortable for long periods of time.  \n\nWhat's not so good: the food, oh no! I wanted this so badly to be yummy. My husband and I spent approx. $194 (w/tip) on dinner, and it was so lackluster. Here's what we had - \n\n** Mar y montana, sea and mountain ($12): small, just one bite, of iberico meat over sea urchin on toast. Too small of a taste to really appreciate anything. \n** Sopa de ajo ($6): small bowl of bread and garlic soup, with egg. It was good, my husband thought it had a heavy, oil flavor. I thought presentation could be better.\n** Gambas al negro ($14): 3 prawns. no flavor at all, and in fact, it tasted old to me (like that freezer burnt, defrosted flavor). Not a winner.\n** Whole Monterey calamari ($10): 3 calamari pieces. It came out tepid, so that was a bummer. Texture was nice, flavor was ok.\n** Grilled razor clams ($14): 3 clams with some wild ramps inside. This was a little smokey, but it worked well with the lemon.\n** Wood-grilled octopus ($12): we got to try this twice, as the chef sent out a first batch that he thought was too small and then subsequently sent out a little more. The first batch was not good - too chewy, tough and way too smokey (I think it's the paprika).  It came with little slices of potatoes, but it added nothing to the overall flavor. The second batch of octopus that came out was better: hot, good texture, not as smokey. So it may be hit or miss with this one.\n** Grilled albondigas ($11): 3 meatballs of duck/pork. It was coated with what tasted like BBQ sauce, so the meat could have been anything, and I wouldn't be able to tell because of the sauce. The sauce is too smokey.\n**  Vineyard greens ($6): GET THIS ONE! If you get anything on the menu, then get these mustard greens. I know, the simplest thing here on the menu, but the flavors of raisins, pine nuts and garlic are amazing. \n** Grilled Iberico Secreto ($22): Pork slices with watercress.

So we dashed in and found out we could sit at the bar without reservation. \n\nFor starter, we ordered party size of agua de valencia (orange water)  made with blood orange juice, gin, vodka and cava. It was refreshing and packed with kicks. It definitely helped to cool us down after walking in the sun. Since we live to eat, you bet we ordered some food and we got chicharron Croquetas de Pollo and wood grilled octopus.\n\nCroqueta was delicious, crunchy on the outside and creamy filling inside. It was especially good when we took the bite with the mandrain orange that came with the plate. The star of the visit would be the grilled octopus. It was super tender and covered with smoky flavor. No matter how many bites I took, I just couldn't have enough.\n\nThe service was great. We sat at the bar and had a good chat with our bartender, Vivian. Very attentive and friendly. It was a blast watching her making all the drinks. She even let us tried the seaweed vodka before making the martini for me. Sure enough, it wasn't my thing. The wait staff was also walking around the restaurant with bunch of pintxos on a board for whoever wanted to try the bite size skewers. \n\nWe love the food, the service, and cozy decor. We couldn't wait to come back again to try the wood grilled bone in 32 oz ribeye!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Also best brunch cocktail, the Agua de Valencia!"], "author": "Tiffany R.", "review": "Excellent service and personalized gluten free and vegan menus!
