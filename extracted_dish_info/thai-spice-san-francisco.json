Today we decided to order Thai food for lunch.\nYAY THAI FOOD! \nThe food we received was not what we expected. About 10 people ordered. \nWhen we first started eating, everyone was saying \"This is okay\"...yet squirting Rooster Sauce on everything (Rooster Sauce that we provided)\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE the person who suggested that we order from Thai Spice, so we didn't want to hurt her feelings because we didn't like her choice; however as our lunch hour progressed, the truth came out. No one was wild about the food. A lot of us thought it was awful. \nWhy this restaurant is called Thai Spice is a mystery, as the overall #1 complaint was that the food had no flavor. I ordered Yellow Curry with pumpkin and chicken. I specified \"Hot\". Sure, I didn't go for \"Thai Hot\", but I expected some amount of burn. I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll. It was good... but not as a salad dressing. \nWe didn't understand why the fresh spring rolls had prawns AND \"imitation crab meat\" in them. Why? Unnecessary. Why put something fake on something that is delicious? \nWe teased and harassed our co-worker for the rest of the shift.

Although pretty much everything on the platter was fried, it didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling. In fact, I rather liked the fish cake and spring rolls (though I loathe to admit I liked the spring rolls since it's kind of like an Italian person admitting they like Sbarro pizza). The appetizer combo came with 4 different kinds of dipping sauce: all on the really sweet side but not overbearingly sweet. The pad kee mao had a good flavor to it, but I found the exorbitant amount of dried red pepper chili flakes to be too texturally distracting. The noodles itself are pan fried so they're already going to be dry, but then to make it even more dry by adding dried flakes?  Basically, the flavor was good and it wasn't too oily, but it was kind of gritty. The green curry was smooth, creamy, flavorful, and came with fresh chunks of chicken and zucchini which surprisingly weren't overcooked or undercooked. The curry itself had a nice kick to it but didn't overbear on the flavor of the dish. The spiciness on everything was pretty spot-on; We ordered \"spicy\" so it wasn't \"Thai spicy\" but it was spicy enough that we had to drink 2 glasses of water each (and we're people who could eat raw jalapenos as a snack).  All in all, the food itself is probably worthy of 3.5 - 4 stars.\n \nSo why only 3 stars?  Here are my peeves with this place:\n\n#1) They don't use fresh chili peppers, only dried flakes! When we ordered the food, we asked for a side condiment of Thai chilies in fish sauce. Her reply?  They don't have any fresh chilies, only chili powder / flakes. Somehow their food still managed to taste pretty good, so I don't want to pass judgment on this fact alone, but seriously, a Thai restaurant that doesn't have Thai chilies?  Kind of like a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce. At least a few jalapenos would have filled the gap somewhat, but they didn't have those either.\n\n#2)  Customer/client service is pretty bad. My husband originally ordered green curry with shrimp (not chicken). I heard him say it so I'm pretty sure the waitress heard him say it. When it came out with chicken instead, we told them we ordered shrimp. Did they offer to exchange it?  No. Instead, they merely said the order was written down as chicken, and left the table before we could even open our mouths in response. \n\n#3) This was our first time eating at this restaurant and only decided to try it based on the \"free entr\u00e9e\" coupon we received a la Valpak. One would think coupons are offered in order to entice people to try their restaurant (new customers = new + possibly repeat business), but somehow redeeming the coupon seemed to piss them off!  First, they gave us a bizarre look when I asked to box up the leftover pad kee mao. There was enough for lunch the next day but the look they gave was like I was asking to box up 2 pieces of noodle. When the cashier person came to drop off our bill, she also dropped off the pad kee mao box...literally. She dropped it right in front of my husband's face and it came tumbling out of the bag. She mumbled something resembling a sorry (hey, we all have our bad days, so we were willing to overlook this) but then as she was making a motion to try and put the box back into the takeout bag, halfway through she basically made a \"screw it\" gesture and then not very discreetly flung the box back onto the table in front of his face again.....  \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's so close to the house and the food is pretty good, but don't know if we can bring ourselves back to eat here again because of the service. Normally we're pretty easy going on service and overlook a lot of things, but kind of feel like they almost didn't want us to come back?", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-05-05"}], "shrimp in the blanket": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the following:\n\nAppetitizer Combo -  Combination of Thai Spice Rolls (FRIED), fish cakes (FRIED), shrimp in the blanket (FRIED), curry puff (FRIED) and crispy tofu (FRIED) served with 4 kinds of sauces.

Today we decided to order Thai food for lunch.\nYAY THAI FOOD! \nThe food we received was not what we expected. About 10 people ordered. \nWhen we first started eating, everyone was saying \"This is okay\"...yet squirting Rooster Sauce on everything (Rooster Sauce that we provided)\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE the person who suggested that we order from Thai Spice, so we didn't want to hurt her feelings because we didn't like her choice; however as our lunch hour progressed, the truth came out. No one was wild about the food. A lot of us thought it was awful. \nWhy this restaurant is called Thai Spice is a mystery, as the overall #1 complaint was that the food had no flavor. I ordered Yellow Curry with pumpkin and chicken. I specified \"Hot\". Sure, I didn't go for \"Thai Hot\", but I expected some amount of burn. I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll. It was good... but not as a salad dressing. \nWe didn't understand why the fresh spring rolls had prawns AND \"imitation crab meat\" in them. Why? Unnecessary. Why put something fake on something that is delicious? \nWe teased and harassed our co-worker for the rest of the shift. She never, ever, again gets to pick where we order from.\nThe amazing thing about this order was that NO ONE liked their food. Usually most people are happy with what we decide to order. Sometimes people say that they wouldn't order from ___ again, but never before have we spent the rest of the afternoon cracking up about how bad lunch was. \nI have read other reviews about Thai Spice which report that this place is hit or miss.\nI guess we missed.

Although pretty much everything on the platter was fried, it didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling. In fact, I rather liked the fish cake and spring rolls (though I loathe to admit I liked the spring rolls since it's kind of like an Italian person admitting they like Sbarro pizza). The appetizer combo came with 4 different kinds of dipping sauce: all on the really sweet side but not overbearingly sweet. The pad kee mao had a good flavor to it, but I found the exorbitant amount of dried red pepper chili flakes to be too texturally distracting. The noodles itself are pan fried so they're already going to be dry, but then to make it even more dry by adding dried flakes?  Basically, the flavor was good and it wasn't too oily, but it was kind of gritty. The green curry was smooth, creamy, flavorful, and came with fresh chunks of chicken and zucchini which surprisingly weren't overcooked or undercooked. The curry itself had a nice kick to it but didn't overbear on the flavor of the dish. The spiciness on everything was pretty spot-on; We ordered \"spicy\" so it wasn't \"Thai spicy\" but it was spicy enough that we had to drink 2 glasses of water each (and we're people who could eat raw jalapenos as a snack).  All in all, the food itself is probably worthy of 3.5 - 4 stars.\n \nSo why only 3 stars?  Here are my peeves with this place:\n\n#1) They don't use fresh chili peppers, only dried flakes! When we ordered the food, we asked for a side condiment of Thai chilies in fish sauce. Her reply?  They don't have any fresh chilies, only chili powder / flakes. Somehow their food still managed to taste pretty good, so I don't want to pass judgment on this fact alone, but seriously, a Thai restaurant that doesn't have Thai chilies?  Kind of like a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce. At least a few jalapenos would have filled the gap somewhat, but they didn't have those either.\n\n#2)  Customer/client service is pretty bad. My husband originally ordered green curry with shrimp (not chicken). I heard him say it so I'm pretty sure the waitress heard him say it. When it came out with chicken instead, we told them we ordered shrimp. Did they offer to exchange it?  No. Instead, they merely said the order was written down as chicken, and left the table before we could even open our mouths in response. \n\n#3) This was our first time eating at this restaurant and only decided to try it based on the \"free entr\u00e9e\" coupon we received a la Valpak. One would think coupons are offered in order to entice people to try their restaurant (new customers = new + possibly repeat business), but somehow redeeming the coupon seemed to piss them off!  First, they gave us a bizarre look when I asked to box up the leftover pad kee mao. There was enough for lunch the next day but the look they gave was like I was asking to box up 2 pieces of noodle. When the cashier person came to drop off our bill, she also dropped off the pad kee mao box...literally. She dropped it right in front of my husband's face and it came tumbling out of the bag. She mumbled something resembling a sorry (hey, we all have our bad days, so we were willing to overlook this) but then as she was making a motion to try and put the box back into the takeout bag, halfway through she basically made a \"screw it\" gesture and then not very discreetly flung the box back onto the table in front of his face again.....  \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's so close to the house and the food is pretty good, but don't know if we can bring ourselves back to eat here again because of the service.

Today we decided to order Thai food for lunch.\nYAY THAI FOOD! \nThe food we received was not what we expected. About 10 people ordered. \nWhen we first started eating, everyone was saying \"This is okay\"...yet squirting Rooster Sauce on everything (Rooster Sauce that we provided)\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE the person who suggested that we order from Thai Spice, so we didn't want to hurt her feelings because we didn't like her choice; however as our lunch hour progressed, the truth came out. No one was wild about the food. A lot of us thought it was awful. \nWhy this restaurant is called Thai Spice is a mystery, as the overall #1 complaint was that the food had no flavor. I ordered Yellow Curry with pumpkin and chicken. I specified \"Hot\". Sure, I didn't go for \"Thai Hot\", but I expected some amount of burn. I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll. It was good... but not as a salad dressing. \nWe didn't understand why the fresh spring rolls had prawns AND \"imitation crab meat\" in them. Why? Unnecessary. Why put something fake on something that is delicious? \nWe teased and harassed our co-worker for the rest of the shift. She never, ever, again gets to pick where we order from.\nThe amazing thing about this order was that NO ONE liked their food. Usually most people are happy with what we decide to order. Sometimes people say that they wouldn't order from ___ again, but never before have we spent the rest of the afternoon cracking up about how bad lunch was. \nI have read other reviews about Thai Spice which report that this place is hit or miss.\nI guess we missed.

About 10 people ordered. \nWhen we first started eating, everyone was saying \"This is okay\"...yet squirting Rooster Sauce on everything (Rooster Sauce that we provided)\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE the person who suggested that we order from Thai Spice, so we didn't want to hurt her feelings because we didn't like her choice; however as our lunch hour progressed, the truth came out. No one was wild about the food. A lot of us thought it was awful. \nWhy this restaurant is called Thai Spice is a mystery, as the overall #1 complaint was that the food had no flavor. I ordered Yellow Curry with pumpkin and chicken. I specified \"Hot\". Sure, I didn't go for \"Thai Hot\", but I expected some amount of burn. I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll.

Although pretty much everything on the platter was fried, it didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling. In fact, I rather liked the fish cake and spring rolls (though I loathe to admit I liked the spring rolls since it's kind of like an Italian person admitting they like Sbarro pizza). The appetizer combo came with 4 different kinds of dipping sauce: all on the really sweet side but not overbearingly sweet. The pad kee mao had a good flavor to it, but I found the exorbitant amount of dried red pepper chili flakes to be too texturally distracting. The noodles itself are pan fried so they're already going to be dry, but then to make it even more dry by adding dried flakes?  Basically, the flavor was good and it wasn't too oily, but it was kind of gritty. The green curry was smooth, creamy, flavorful, and came with fresh chunks of chicken and zucchini which surprisingly weren't overcooked or undercooked. The curry itself had a nice kick to it but didn't overbear on the flavor of the dish. The spiciness on everything was pretty spot-on; We ordered \"spicy\" so it wasn't \"Thai spicy\" but it was spicy enough that we had to drink 2 glasses of water each (and we're people who could eat raw jalapenos as a snack).  All in all, the food itself is probably worthy of 3.5 - 4 stars.\n \nSo why only 3 stars?  Here are my peeves with this place:\n\n#1) They don't use fresh chili peppers, only dried flakes! When we ordered the food, we asked for a side condiment of Thai chilies in fish sauce. Her reply?  They don't have any fresh chilies, only chili powder / flakes. Somehow their food still managed to taste pretty good, so I don't want to pass judgment on this fact alone, but seriously, a Thai restaurant that doesn't have Thai chilies?  Kind of like a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce. At least a few jalapenos would have filled the gap somewhat, but they didn't have those either.\n\n#2)  Customer/client service is pretty bad. My husband originally ordered green curry with shrimp (not chicken). I heard him say it so I'm pretty sure the waitress heard him say it. When it came out with chicken instead, we told them we ordered shrimp. Did they offer to exchange it?  No. Instead, they merely said the order was written down as chicken, and left the table before we could even open our mouths in response. \n\n#3) This was our first time eating at this restaurant and only decided to try it based on the \"free entr\u00e9e\" coupon we received a la Valpak. One would think coupons are offered in order to entice people to try their restaurant (new customers = new + possibly repeat business), but somehow redeeming the coupon seemed to piss them off!  First, they gave us a bizarre look when I asked to box up the leftover pad kee mao. There was enough for lunch the next day but the look they gave was like I was asking to box up 2 pieces of noodle. When the cashier person came to drop off our bill, she also dropped off the pad kee mao box...literally. She dropped it right in front of my husband's face and it came tumbling out of the bag. She mumbled something resembling a sorry (hey, we all have our bad days, so we were willing to overlook this) but then as she was making a motion to try and put the box back into the takeout bag, halfway through she basically made a \"screw it\" gesture and then not very discreetly flung the box back onto the table in front of his face again.....  \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's so close to the house and the food is pretty good, but don't know if we can bring ourselves back to eat here again because of the service.

Unfortunately, I either ordered the wrong dishes because the dishes I got were an expensive mistake!\n\nWhat I ordered:\nRed Curry with chicken ($13) - this dish was very rich with coconut milk and it had a strong flavor which I attributed to not just the curry but alot of salt (eeck!). The dish just had tons of bamboo strips and maybe a couple of pieces of basil. No other vegetable in this dish which made it very boring.\n\nSauteed Mixed Vegetables with Polk ($12) - trying to be healthy? Well this dish had baby corn, cabbage, onions, zucchini, carrot bits, green beans, bean sprouts and small oblong strips of pork in a brown sauce. When I opened the take out container most of the veggies were really limp. Eating some of this dish, I thought it tasted somewhat odd 'cause it was super sweet like there was tons of sugar in that sauce making it inedible after a while.\n\nWith these two entrees I got one order of jasmine rice ($2) and one order of brown rice ($2.75). Personally, I enjoyed the texture of the latter much more because it has some bite to it; whereas the jasmine rice is small grain and has a refined texture that really has a too soft mouth feel for me.\n\nOverall, I was highly disappointed by my entrees from Thai Spice.

It was past their closing time when I got my order so when I called I didn't want to make a big fuss about it and asked them to just issue me a credit for next time. An older woman told me that the credit would be in their computer system and that as long as I gave my name/phone number/address, whomever took the order should be able to find the credit. About a week later I went into the restaurant to eat, I tried to use my credit and was told I wouldn't be able to use it for dining in. Um, weird, but ok. Fast forward to today, when I called for a delivery order and tried to use my credit and the girl on the other end of the line said there was no record of my credit and that there was no manager available to speak to and that if she gave me the credit the fee would come out of her paycheck. WTF?!\n\nLuckily Seamless customer service is awesome and they're going to argue with the owner on my behalf and get my refund. \n\nThai Spice, I have a couple of questions for you:\n1. Why waste time and hundreds of dollars in printing  fees to print coupons if you're going to make it nearly impossible to use the coupons.\n2. Why lie to me about the ease of using a credit based on your obvious mistake when I was doing you a favor by not making your kitchen staff stay late to remake a dish.\n3.

However, for a sit down meal, they are very attentive.  In the few times I've been here now, there haven't been a ton of people sitting in the restaurant.  One of my best friends lives around the corner from Thai Spice, so this is always an easy meal for us.  I've had their Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, and both dishes come exactly as they're typically served in Thai restaurants here.  Both of us usually order a Fresh Spring Rolls order to share, and this time we ordered a side of Chicken Satay as well.  The spring rolls are OK, it tastes like they've been sitting in the refrigerator for awhile since everything's a little on the firm side.  The satay skewers were surprisingly really good, especially with the awesome side of peanut sauce.  Rather than going with the usual, I ordered the Silver Noodle Salad.  It wasn't nearly as filling as some of the rice/noodle dishes, but I enjoyed every ingredient in the salad (silver noodles, ground chicken, shrimp, crispy garlic, onions, cilantro and lemon juice).  Since it was chilly outside, we also ordered two hot teas and it came out in these beautiful glass tea pots.  The tea was hot oolong tea, but it didn't taste like anything standard.  It was a beautiful cup of tea (be careful if you're wearing light colors, the tea is an orange-ish color and will stain if you get it on you).  I'll probably end up coming back to Thai Spice in the future, most for convenience.

When I ordered it, the waiter did not ask if I wanted any spice, in fact.  I ordered some sticky rice to accompany it, which is how I was taught by a friend who used to live in Thailand to eat the salad.  I thought that for the price of the salad, it was a very small portion.  However, a few others at the table tried this salad and rice for the first time, ever, and remarked they liked it.  \nAs my main dish, I ordered a fat rice noodle dish that had maybe 7 lightly spiced shrimps, fresh broccoli, matchsticks of carrot in a light, sweet gravy (maybe made from some fermented black bean paste).  This was alright, but again, not terribly interesting.  What was most unpleasant was finding the vein in each shrimp not having been completely removed -- Eeewww!  Yukky green stuff!

Although pretty much everything on the platter was fried, it didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling. In fact, I rather liked the fish cake and spring rolls (though I loathe to admit I liked the spring rolls since it's kind of like an Italian person admitting they like Sbarro pizza). The appetizer combo came with 4 different kinds of dipping sauce: all on the really sweet side but not overbearingly sweet. The pad kee mao had a good flavor to it, but I found the exorbitant amount of dried red pepper chili flakes to be too texturally distracting. The noodles itself are pan fried so they're already going to be dry, but then to make it even more dry by adding dried flakes?  Basically, the flavor was good and it wasn't too oily, but it was kind of gritty. The green curry was smooth, creamy, flavorful, and came with fresh chunks of chicken and zucchini which surprisingly weren't overcooked or undercooked. The curry itself had a nice kick to it but didn't overbear on the flavor of the dish. The spiciness on everything was pretty spot-on; We ordered \"spicy\" so it wasn't \"Thai spicy\" but it was spicy enough that we had to drink 2 glasses of water each (and we're people who could eat raw jalapenos as a snack).

When we ordered the food, we asked for a side condiment of Thai chilies in fish sauce. Her reply?  They don't have any fresh chilies, only chili powder / flakes. Somehow their food still managed to taste pretty good, so I don't want to pass judgment on this fact alone, but seriously, a Thai restaurant that doesn't have Thai chilies?  Kind of like a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce. At least a few jalapenos would have filled the gap somewhat, but they didn't have those either.\n\n#2)  Customer/client service is pretty bad. My husband originally ordered green curry with shrimp (not chicken). I heard him say it so I'm pretty sure the waitress heard him say it. When it came out with chicken instead, we told them we ordered shrimp. Did they offer to exchange it?  No. Instead, they merely said the order was written down as chicken, and left the table before we could even open our mouths in response. \n\n#3) This was our first time eating at this restaurant and only decided to try it based on the \"free entr\u00e9e\" coupon we received a la Valpak. One would think coupons are offered in order to entice people to try their restaurant (new customers = new + possibly repeat business), but somehow redeeming the coupon seemed to piss them off!  First, they gave us a bizarre look when I asked to box up the leftover pad kee mao. There was enough for lunch the next day but the look they gave was like I was asking to box up 2 pieces of noodle. When the cashier person came to drop off our bill, she also dropped off the pad kee mao box...literally. She dropped it right in front of my husband's face and it came tumbling out of the bag. She mumbled something resembling a sorry (hey, we all have our bad days, so we were willing to overlook this) but then as she was making a motion to try and put the box back into the takeout bag, halfway through she basically made a \"screw it\" gesture and then not very discreetly flung the box back onto the table in front of his face again.....  \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's so close to the house and the food is pretty good, but don't know if we can bring ourselves back to eat here again because of the service.

Although pretty much everything on the platter was fried, it didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling. In fact, I rather liked the fish cake and spring rolls (though I loathe to admit I liked the spring rolls since it's kind of like an Italian person admitting they like Sbarro pizza). The appetizer combo came with 4 different kinds of dipping sauce: all on the really sweet side but not overbearingly sweet. The pad kee mao had a good flavor to it, but I found the exorbitant amount of dried red pepper chili flakes to be too texturally distracting. The noodles itself are pan fried so they're already going to be dry, but then to make it even more dry by adding dried flakes?  Basically, the flavor was good and it wasn't too oily, but it was kind of gritty. The green curry was smooth, creamy, flavorful, and came with fresh chunks of chicken and zucchini which surprisingly weren't overcooked or undercooked. The curry itself had a nice kick to it but didn't overbear on the flavor of the dish. The spiciness on everything was pretty spot-on; We ordered \"spicy\" so it wasn't \"Thai spicy\" but it was spicy enough that we had to drink 2 glasses of water each (and we're people who could eat raw jalapenos as a snack).  All in all, the food itself is probably worthy of 3.5 - 4 stars.\n \nSo why only 3 stars?  Here are my peeves with this place:\n\n#1) They don't use fresh chili peppers, only dried flakes! When we ordered the food, we asked for a side condiment of Thai chilies in fish sauce. Her reply?  They don't have any fresh chilies, only chili powder / flakes. Somehow their food still managed to taste pretty good, so I don't want to pass judgment on this fact alone, but seriously, a Thai restaurant that doesn't have Thai chilies?  Kind of like a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce. At least a few jalapenos would have filled the gap somewhat, but they didn't have those either.\n\n#2)  Customer/client service is pretty bad. My husband originally ordered green curry with shrimp (not chicken). I heard him say it so I'm pretty sure the waitress heard him say it. When it came out with chicken instead, we told them we ordered shrimp. Did they offer to exchange it?  No. Instead, they merely said the order was written down as chicken, and left the table before we could even open our mouths in response. \n\n#3) This was our first time eating at this restaurant and only decided to try it based on the \"free entr\u00e9e\" coupon we received a la Valpak. One would think coupons are offered in order to entice people to try their restaurant (new customers = new + possibly repeat business), but somehow redeeming the coupon seemed to piss them off!  First, they gave us a bizarre look when I asked to box up the leftover pad kee mao. There was enough for lunch the next day but the look they gave was like I was asking to box up 2 pieces of noodle. When the cashier person came to drop off our bill, she also dropped off the pad kee mao box...literally. She dropped it right in front of my husband's face and it came tumbling out of the bag. She mumbled something resembling a sorry (hey, we all have our bad days, so we were willing to overlook this) but then as she was making a motion to try and put the box back into the takeout bag, halfway through she basically made a \"screw it\" gesture and then not very discreetly flung the box back onto the table in front of his face again.....  \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's so close to the house and the food is pretty good, but don't know if we can bring ourselves back to eat here again because of the service.

About 10 people ordered. \nWhen we first started eating, everyone was saying \"This is okay\"...yet squirting Rooster Sauce on everything (Rooster Sauce that we provided)\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE the person who suggested that we order from Thai Spice, so we didn't want to hurt her feelings because we didn't like her choice; however as our lunch hour progressed, the truth came out. No one was wild about the food. A lot of us thought it was awful. \nWhy this restaurant is called Thai Spice is a mystery, as the overall #1 complaint was that the food had no flavor. I ordered Yellow Curry with pumpkin and chicken. I specified \"Hot\". Sure, I didn't go for \"Thai Hot\", but I expected some amount of burn. I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll. It was good... but not as a salad dressing. \nWe didn't understand why the fresh spring rolls had prawns AND \"imitation crab meat\" in them. Why? Unnecessary. Why put something fake on something that is delicious? \nWe teased and harassed our co-worker for the rest of the shift.

I think.)\n\nSo I can honestly say that I'm not exactly in the greatest of positions to evaluate Thai food, but I can tell you at least that Thai Spice is a decent, tastefully-decorated, prettily-presented restaurant.

I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll. It was good... but not as a salad dressing. \nWe didn't understand why the fresh spring rolls had prawns AND \"imitation crab meat\" in them. Why? Unnecessary. Why put something fake on something that is delicious? \nWe teased and harassed our co-worker for the rest of the shift. She never, ever, again gets to pick where we order from.\nThe amazing thing about this order was that NO ONE liked their food. Usually most people are happy with what we decide to order. Sometimes people say that they wouldn't order from ___ again, but never before have we spent the rest of the afternoon cracking up about how bad lunch was. \nI have read other reviews about Thai Spice which report that this place is hit or miss.\nI guess we missed. It was a shame that we missed totally, and completely, on 200 dollars worth of food.", "rating": 1, "date": "2012-12-16"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorite dishes are Basil Duck and Pat Thai Bu with crab meat. \n", "Reasonable price..\n", "The only thing is service ", "is a bit overly and unbearably attentative.

Ate here again w/some discount coupons my GF got and my impression is the same.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is very pleasing and, if you can get one of  the 2 window tables and, service on this visit was fine.  Beverages were served and water was refilled promptly w/o asking and the food ordered was served in acceptable interval and the food (with one exception) was fine.\n\nOrdered Spinach Rolls ($8) and Angel wings ($12)  for appetizers and Lemongrass Seafood ($15)  and Pumpkin Chicken Yellow Curry ($10)  for entrees.  The spinach rolls were larger than I've seen before and had a delightful flavor w/roasted coconut flakes, peanut sauce and lime; the plate was also decorated w/orchid petals and a spice basil sauce that we couldn't resist.

The Pumpkin Chicken Yellow Curry was a disappointment -- the chicken was tough and dry -- as though it had been used to make broth and then thrown into the curry to cover it -- but oddly the pumpkin was tough and seemed undercooked.  The curry sauce on the other hand tasted fine. \n\nThe total cost of the meal including $3 for 2 small bowls of rice (which I don't think should be charged for) and a bottle of Thai beer for $4 (which was reasonable) plus tax and tip was $65.  Pretty steep for a late lunch..  So, if you can afford the freight, you should have a decent meal and dining experience at Thai Spice but if you're looking for something more \"affordable\" w/equally good food (albeit not as pleasant decor or food presentation) there are many options on the same block where Thai Spice is located -- particularly Sam's Chinese Restaurant which is located only a few doors away.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-04-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Among other favorites, we tried the Lemon Grass Seafood.

We had a party of about 10 people and we were able to be accommodated perfectly. This was the first time that I had been to Thai Spice, so I really had no expectations. Many of my friends had told me that the food was very good, so my only expectation was to have a great meal with the company of my close friends. \n\nSince it was a party and a somewhat large group, we dined family style. This worked out very well for us because there are so many items to chose from that the menu can become overwhelming. However, with family style dining, we were able to try a variety of appetizers and entrees that we individually, would not have the opportunity to experience. The food was very good and the portions were reasonable. I also very much enjoyed the ambiance and decor that this restaurant offers. \n\nI am a big fan of seafood soup, so that is what I ordered for my main entree and I was not disappointed.
