Style wise, it's like Submarine Center and Gene's Liquor - toasted subs with Italian dressing (secret sauce).  The sandwiches are bigger with more filling than Submarine Center and they taste better too.  \n\nYou choose your meat and bread for the regular sandwiches ($5.47 - $6.47) or you can choose one of their specialty sandwiches.  There's one vegetarian sandwich (Politically Correct).  I tried the One Flap Down ($6.47, don't really understand the name) with turkey, salami, ham (which I omitted), American cheese, lettuce, thin tomato slices, red onions, mayo, mustard, pepperoncini and special dressing on Dutch Crunch.  Positives: Generous amount of meat, great bread, hefty sandwich.  Minor flaws: not enough veggies, especially the red onions and tomatoes, too much mustard, and it wasn't toasted long enough.  It was still cold in the center.  I'm sure they'll adjust this and increase the toasting time.  Or ask for it extra toasty.  Jalapenos are free.  You can add on soup, salad, chips, cookies and soft serve ice cream.  \n\nThe shop is bright and clean with a couple of tables.  The owner was really nice and would like to adjust his menu to reflect the preferences of the community.  I hope they have good meatballs.  3.5 stars for now but I bet that they will improve since they just opened.

The sandwiches are bigger with more filling than Submarine Center and they taste better too.  \n\nYou choose your meat and bread for the regular sandwiches ($5.47 - $6.47) or you can choose one of their specialty sandwiches.  There's one vegetarian sandwich (Politically Correct).  I tried the One Flap Down ($6.47, don't really understand the name) with turkey, salami, ham (which I omitted), American cheese, lettuce, thin tomato slices, red onions, mayo, mustard, pepperoncini and special dressing on Dutch Crunch.  Positives: Generous amount of meat, great bread, hefty sandwich.  Minor flaws: not enough veggies, especially the red onions and tomatoes, too much mustard, and it wasn't toasted long enough.  It was still cold in the center.  I'm sure they'll adjust this and increase the toasting time.  Or ask for it extra toasty.  Jalapenos are free.  You can add on soup, salad, chips, cookies and soft serve ice cream.  \n\nThe shop is bright and clean with a couple of tables.  The owner was really nice and would like to adjust his menu to reflect the preferences of the community.
