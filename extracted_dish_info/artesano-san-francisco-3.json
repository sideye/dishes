At first we went with outdoor but then realized service would be a lot quicker indoors, so we went inside. I loved how there were menu booth options - so much more comfortable!\n\nThe menu is huge and has tons of pesce and veggie options! We weren't TOO hungry, so we decided to split the chopped salad and the black bean soup. I was very happy that the chef was able to split both the salad and soup into two separate bowls / plates. Most restaurants won't go through this hassle and will just give you an extra bowl/plate and have you do it yourself. Presentation was great and the portion was just right. I can't imagine that I would be able to finish an entire salad or soup! I loved how much crunch the salad had and the plantain chips that came with the soup were AMAZING! The soup itself needed a little more flavor, but the salad was just perfect and I highly recommend it. I asked for croutons to be added to the salad (do it - they're homemade and delish). Also, their homemade hot sauce is amazing. Next time I come here, I will definitely have to ask for a little to go! \n\nService was excellent! Everyone was extremely nice and very helpful. I loved the decor of this place. The mason jars all around the restaurant are a great little decorative touch. This place is very healthy, which is an added bonus. My friend and I were both very full but didn't feel as though we overate after dining here!
