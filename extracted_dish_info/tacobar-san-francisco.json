I don't know why more places don't do stuff like this. For $3.75, it was enough bites to be a great deal for such flavor. \n\nThe fish and yucatan pork tied for second. The fish was a decent sized piece covered in a rich tomato-y sauce, Veracruz-style, over a bed of cabbage. Crunch, sauce, silky fish, nice bites. \n\nThe carnitas was the biggest portion. I was tempted to turn it into two tacos. And for $3.75, it was basically as much food as two $2 tacos at Mission places. The shrimp on the other hand was fairly tiny, so we didn't share that.

"], "author": "Elizabeth T.", "review": "I really wanted to be a fan of this place - when I saw it being built, I was ecstatic. This morning, when I checked the reviews, I chalked the low ratings up to \"lower pac height snobs\" who were expecting too much out of a taco place. Unfortunately, I have either become one of those folks, or, as I suspect, this place isn't marketing itself well.\n\nTacoBar makes you think it will be a down-to-earth taco place, however, it's actually a pseudo-gourmet take on Mexican food. That alone doesn't give it the low rating, though - it's the price mixed with the attitudes mixed with the poor explanations of what you are getting.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I ordered, we got 2 carnitas tacos, a carne asada quesadilla with the extra crema fresca and guacamole, and chips and salsa. A lot of people on here complained about the price of chips, but for the quality of chip and salsa, they were amazing. However, the guy in front of me got his salsa and some cheese heaped on the chips, and I got a relatively small pot of salsa. I had to ask why mine were different than his, and they said \"oh you have to ask for that\" which I didn't understand (how would I know that?) and then I had to ask for the cheese. I thought the guac came with the chips, but that was my mistake, and I was fine with that.\n\nWe sat outside (not a ton of seating, but it's a nice place inside) and besides the really annoying guy's barking dog (people, don't go to a restaurant and tie your dog up. You are a jerk when you do this) it was really nice. I was annoyed that when I tried to use a squeeze bottle for the salsa, the top wasn't screwed on and it all poured out everywhere, but again, small thing. \n\nMy biggest disappointment was the main course. My boyfriend had tacos, which he said were fine - the pork was a little bland and a little dry. However, my \"quesadilla\" was not a quesadilla. At first we thought I got a burrito in some flakey kind of flatbread. I inquired as to where my sour cream and guac were (every quesadilla I've ever gotten has the pico de gallo, sour cream, and guac on the side and that's why I love them) and the woman went back in to get them. She didn't return - instead a guy who I believe was the owner came. He showed me my receipt and told me I never ordered guacamole, and I said \"I got this with the special extra\" and he said \"that's not the same as guacamole. You have to pay a lot of money for that.\" \n\nI thought that was a really weird and rude thing to say, so I told him he should explain his menu better and he pointed at my food and said \"I can see guacamole in there.\" Then he left.\n\nThere was, indeed, something resembling a little guacamole inside my not-quesadilla, but it was such a pathetic amount that I will say that no one should get the extra - for two bucks a glop of sour cream and a tiny green coloring of guacamole isn't worth it. Avocado isn't gold, people. \n\nOverall, however, I didn't like the quesadilla. The tortilla wasn't a tortilla, it was shaped like a burrito and difficult to eat, and overall this take on fusion wasn't what I was expecting nor what I would have ordered had I know. Couple that with the rude owner and the lack of explanations, I'm never going back to this place. \n\nIf you guys can get your attitudes in order and figure out a good system for selling things that doesn't leave people confused and feeling ripped off, I'll come back. I have no qualms paying $25 like I did today for the meal I had - I just don't want to feel verbally assaulted by the owner because I asked where my sides were. Food isn't a fine art.

I missed my La Salsa fixes and was very happy to learn that some of the unemployed La Salsa staff was working at Taco Bar.  I wish it could be a different reality with this place.... it's terrible.\n\nI went the week they opened to try it and although I'm not too picky, the menu seemed rather vague and lacked details.  There are desert items and horchata beverages listed by the cash register,  but you wouldn't notice through a crowd.  You think the street signs are unclear in Mexico?  Try Tacobar.\n\nI decided to go with the Tortilla Soup, for a sky-rocketed $7.95.  This is not a restaurant, nor is the atmosphere restaurant-like.  It's supposed to be a high-end Mexican cantina.  Well, at modest Mexican cantinas I get chips & salsa, and when I ask for water I'm given a real glass of water -- Tacobar insists you buy bottled water, or you can self-serve yourself with a freakin' DIXIE CUP OF WATER!  I'm not rinsing and spitting for my dentist, yo!  I'm paying $9 bucks for bland and too salty soup without chips and salsa while sitting in a corner with my knees hitting the wall!  You think that shopping and driving in Mexico are an altered state of reality?  Try Tacobar.\n\nI suspected I was expecting too much my first visit, so I gave Tacobar another try yesterday.  I got a Carne Asada Taco to go.  I was given a little attitude on ordering just one taco - but that's all I wanted this time.  I asked about chips and salsa, as I didn't get them the first time I was there as anyone would expect from Mexican cuisine, but I was told that's separate.  Well, my one taco was more than $5 bucks so chips and salsa really should've been included.  I didn't get them.\n\nI got my Steak Taco to go and got to eating it within a few minutes -- it wasn't really warm, the pinto beans (loose, not mashed or refried for ease of eating) were falling from every direction and the carne asada and pico de gallo were barely visible - NO NAPKINS INCLUDED!

NOT COOL AT ALL JACK.\n\nI know I can sit down at a real Mexican restaurant with a waiter waiting on me, a full meal with great flavour and a live Mariachi Band for what I've wasted at Tacobar.  Not only is it not good food, it's a negative vibe also -- No real smiles when you walk in.  I've seen the owner leering around the shop probably wondering how things are going.  He should really ask the diners instead of staring/glaring at them, because so far his ideas are way off the mark.  You want an overpriced and seriously deficient Mexican meal?

"], "author": "Elizabeth T.", "review": "I really wanted to be a fan of this place - when I saw it being built, I was ecstatic. This morning, when I checked the reviews, I chalked the low ratings up to \"lower pac height snobs\" who were expecting too much out of a taco place. Unfortunately, I have either become one of those folks, or, as I suspect, this place isn't marketing itself well.\n\nTacoBar makes you think it will be a down-to-earth taco place, however, it's actually a pseudo-gourmet take on Mexican food. That alone doesn't give it the low rating, though - it's the price mixed with the attitudes mixed with the poor explanations of what you are getting.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I ordered, we got 2 carnitas tacos, a carne asada quesadilla with the extra crema fresca and guacamole, and chips and salsa. A lot of people on here complained about the price of chips, but for the quality of chip and salsa, they were amazing. However, the guy in front of me got his salsa and some cheese heaped on the chips, and I got a relatively small pot of salsa. I had to ask why mine were different than his, and they said \"oh you have to ask for that\" which I didn't understand (how would I know that?) and then I had to ask for the cheese. I thought the guac came with the chips, but that was my mistake, and I was fine with that.\n\nWe sat outside (not a ton of seating, but it's a nice place inside) and besides the really annoying guy's barking dog (people, don't go to a restaurant and tie your dog up. You are a jerk when you do this) it was really nice. I was annoyed that when I tried to use a squeeze bottle for the salsa, the top wasn't screwed on and it all poured out everywhere, but again, small thing. \n\nMy biggest disappointment was the main course. My boyfriend had tacos, which he said were fine - the pork was a little bland and a little dry. However, my \"quesadilla\" was not a quesadilla. At first we thought I got a burrito in some flakey kind of flatbread. I inquired as to where my sour cream and guac were (every quesadilla I've ever gotten has the pico de gallo, sour cream, and guac on the side and that's why I love them) and the woman went back in to get them. She didn't return - instead a guy who I believe was the owner came. He showed me my receipt and told me I never ordered guacamole, and I said \"I got this with the special extra\" and he said \"that's not the same as guacamole. You have to pay a lot of money for that.\" \n\nI thought that was a really weird and rude thing to say, so I told him he should explain his menu better and he pointed at my food and said \"I can see guacamole in there.\" Then he left.\n\nThere was, indeed, something resembling a little guacamole inside my not-quesadilla, but it was such a pathetic amount that I will say that no one should get the extra - for two bucks a glop of sour cream and a tiny green coloring of guacamole isn't worth it. Avocado isn't gold, people. \n\nOverall, however, I didn't like the quesadilla. The tortilla wasn't a tortilla, it was shaped like a burrito and difficult to eat, and overall this take on fusion wasn't what I was expecting nor what I would have ordered had I know. Couple that with the rude owner and the lack of explanations, I'm never going back to this place. \n\nIf you guys can get your attitudes in order and figure out a good system for selling things that doesn't leave people confused and feeling ripped off, I'll come back. I have no qualms paying $25 like I did today for the meal I had - I just don't want to feel verbally assaulted by the owner because I asked where my sides were. Food isn't a fine art.

Instead, I shrugged and said, \"this cheese, its a bit...rubbery.\" To which she replied it was meant to be a cheese crisp. This is the cheese crisp I had paid $1.95 to have added to my fish taco that they had sandwiched between my two tortillas. Well, someone ought to educate the owner on what happens when you fry cheese. The oil comes out, the flavor leaves with it, and you are left with rubbery cheese that is neither palatable nor very digestible. A good garnish, yes, but give me some cotija, not this crappy cheese disc thing. The part that gets me the the most, though, is that if you are going to walk around asking your (clearly disappointed) patrons how their (clearly bland) meal is, then listen to them!! Don't you realize you are in the first few months of being open and that your diners may have some real feedback to help you improve and make me actually want to come back?! Listen to your paying customers, your neighbors, and your potential future return patrons.\n\nAlex D. had the carnitas taco. He left at least 2/3 of it behind. His poor little tasteless, all-filler-no-killer, bland bean and tasteless salsa mess, was so bad he didn't want to waste precious tummy space on it.\n\nMy fish taco which I made Especial (read: NOT Especial at all) was a hot mess of bland, not crispy or fresh tasting fish, topped off with some more bland guacamole and crema. It was not easy to eat, nor good to eat. YUCK. And PLEASE tell me how you can possibly justify charging $1.95 to add a teaspoon of guac, a teaspoon of crema, and crap plastic cheese to my already overpriced taco?! I'm not a cheap person, and I'll be the first to pay for quality, but this my friends was not quality at all.\n\nThe Jicama salad was a poor excuse for a salad. It was literally huge discs of jicama, combined with unrecognizable mashed tasteless grapefruit, cilantro, and peanuts - it was impossible to eat. At least julienne cut the freakin' jicama so your diner can eat your bad tasteless salad!\n\nI just returned from Puerto Vallarta where I had amazing food, with tons of flavor. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled, but I think even someone who dines at Denny's would think TacoBar has forgotten their flavor in their food.\n\nI've read that the owner here used to work with the guys from Nick's Crispy tacos. Save yourself from this mess of a taco shop and go to Nick's. I don't love that place either, but at least your won't feel ripped off by some bitchy owner at this new Pac Heights establishment and you can use your leftover cash to catch a cab to the Mission for some real flavor.\n\nNever again.", "rating": 1, "date": "2010-05-16"}], "house pickled jalapenos": [], "coconut flan": [{"excerpts": ["Pollo Burrito, Carne Asada Tacos & Coconut Flan\nDevour:  Shrimp Taco & Grilled Shrimp\n", "Total:  $32.41"], "author": "Genevieve Y.", "review": "Date & Time:  Wednesday April 14, 2010 @ 1pm \nDining Companions:  Dana & Janie\nScene:  Well-Heeled Pairs of Young Ladies in Elizabeth Charles Dresses  & Guys in Blazers, Thomas Pink Shirts, Jeans & Loafers\nVibe:  Chill\nDecor:  Bright & Cheery.

I had two of the pulled pork tacos, which were a special the day I was there. The tacos were on your standard size corn tortilla, like you would find in any local supermarket. Another reviewer mentioned that the tortillas were three inches, mine clearly were not. The pork, which was topped by a small amount of citrus marinated onions,  was tender, tasty, plentiful and clearly of excellent quality. It was not something that you would see in a cheaper taco and wonder what part of the pig it came from. Each taco was $3.25, and in my opinion worth it. After I was finished eating a a man that I think was the chef came to my table. He was very friendly and recommended the coconut flan. It was as good as he said it would be. It was a denser flan, not jello-like in consistency, and very good. \n\nOther reviewers mentioned the small portions that one gets at the Taco Bar. After scoping out what the other patrons were eating and seeing the size of my tacos and flan, I have to wonder again if we were eating at the same restaurant.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that this place is \"deceptive\". I didn't find it so, but if you are doubtful about this place just check out a menu and look around at what others are eating. When I was there the place was very crowded and busy, a deceptive place wouldn't have such a crowd I would think.\n\nAs for the price, I believe it was fair, given the quality of the food and the quick and friendly service. \n\nI found the food at Taco Bar food to be authentic.
