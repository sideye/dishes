She had recently broken her foot, so I waited for her upstairs. Downstairs seems to be where the party's at though - it was so loud you could hear everything upstairs, and it seemed really crowded. Service wasn't exactly prompt or attentive, and confusingly, we had at least three different servers. It seemed like we waited quite a while for one of the three to notice that we were definitively ready to order.\nThe only reason to come to a Belgian place aside from the beer is to try the classic Moules Frites. So we went for the traditional Mariniere preparation with white wine and shallots. A steaming cauldron of mussels & broth showed up. I asked for an additional bowl and got a perplexed look. We were *sharing* - was I supposed to lean over my friend's shoulder and pick out my mussels from the pot on her side of the table? The mussels that we were able to eat were delicious. Unfortunately, at least 6 or 7 of the mussels at the bottom of the pot were still closed, ergo inedible. The broth was a little watery as well, but had good flavor. The cone of frites was on the average side. It was a good-sized portion to share, but the fries were quite unevenly fried - some nice and crispy, others limp. The roasted garlic mayo and the spicy ketchup were both very tasty though.\nI'll reserve my highest praise for the beer selection. There is so much going on with this beer list! Their draft selection is extensive, and then there's an additional bottle list! It's organized by style and even includes a brief glossary of beer styles, which is very helpful. We had 4 beers in total, including the St. Feuillien Trippel, the Affligem Blond, the Ertvelds Wit, and the Ephemere Cassis. All except the Canadian Ephemere were Belgian, but they were all incredibly good and arrived in the appropriate glassware. The Ephemere was a great \"dessert\" beer - the cassis flavor wasn't overpowering at all, just subtly tart. I really want to come with a larger group so that we can explore the bottle list a bit more - they apparently have over 400 beers.\nIf this place stepped up the service, I'd definitely award another star.

"], "author": "Kristen L.", "review": "I should come clean and start by saying that I went into La Trappe with a giant bias. My mom is from Belgium, I went there every few years growing up, and I was literally there three weeks ago, so I may have a big Belgian chip on my shoulder. I went into La Trappe expecting reasonable greatness, and I ended up finding good-ish food but horrendously overpriced beers. This was, in short, disappointing.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers have said, the beer selection at La Trappe is huge. You pretty much need the drink menu to sort through all your options, and there are pages and pages of options. My issue was with the prices of the selections. Okay, I know we're in San Francisco and drinks aren't cheap here (and yes, I was spoiled by the cheap Belgian beer in, you know, Belgium), but this was too much. The basest Belgian beer will put you out $7, and if you want anything you've (or I've) heard of, you're looking at spending A LOT more. I gravitated immediately towards the Lindeman's Kriek and Gueuze, family favorites, and was shocked to see that they were on the menu for $29. \"Maybe it's a giant bottle,\" I thought to myself. No siree, it's $29 for your run-of-the-mill 12 oz. bottle. And yes, I do realize that importing beer is expensive, but you can go down to Cost Plus World Market to buy Lindemans and you won't pay more than $9 for a big bottle. I resigned myself to a cheaper, less delicious beer and put our group's name on the list for a table.\n\nHere's where I had another issue with La Trappe. We were a group of eight, and I know that that can be very hard to accommodate, especially on a Saturday night in the city. When I arrived there were only two of us, so I was more than happy to wait at the bar with my cheap beer for a while until more people in our group arrived. Not too much later, we had six of our eight people and asked if we could be seated. Unfortunately, we were told that we couldn't be seated until our full group had arrived, and any other full groups that came in the meantime could take the table we had our eyes on. In principle, this seems like a pretty good system so you don't have groups taking up a table long before they're ready, but I know that when we came in, we were asked if we were a part of a partial group that was... already sitting at a table. I don't mind being told to wait, but not if I know the rules aren't being applied across the board.\n\nYou'll be shocked to hear that by the time our last two people showed up, our table had been taken not five minutes before. We were told we could wait in the lounge area, but we could only have appetizers there and not the regular entrees.

"], "author": "Kristen L.", "review": "I should come clean and start by saying that I went into La Trappe with a giant bias. My mom is from Belgium, I went there every few years growing up, and I was literally there three weeks ago, so I may have a big Belgian chip on my shoulder. I went into La Trappe expecting reasonable greatness, and I ended up finding good-ish food but horrendously overpriced beers. This was, in short, disappointing.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers have said, the beer selection at La Trappe is huge. You pretty much need the drink menu to sort through all your options, and there are pages and pages of options. My issue was with the prices of the selections. Okay, I know we're in San Francisco and drinks aren't cheap here (and yes, I was spoiled by the cheap Belgian beer in, you know, Belgium), but this was too much. The basest Belgian beer will put you out $7, and if you want anything you've (or I've) heard of, you're looking at spending A LOT more. I gravitated immediately towards the Lindeman's Kriek and Gueuze, family favorites, and was shocked to see that they were on the menu for $29. \"Maybe it's a giant bottle,\" I thought to myself. No siree, it's $29 for your run-of-the-mill 12 oz. bottle. And yes, I do realize that importing beer is expensive, but you can go down to Cost Plus World Market to buy Lindemans and you won't pay more than $9 for a big bottle. I resigned myself to a cheaper, less delicious beer and put our group's name on the list for a table.\n\nHere's where I had another issue with La Trappe. We were a group of eight, and I know that that can be very hard to accommodate, especially on a Saturday night in the city. When I arrived there were only two of us, so I was more than happy to wait at the bar with my cheap beer for a while until more people in our group arrived. Not too much later, we had six of our eight people and asked if we could be seated. Unfortunately, we were told that we couldn't be seated until our full group had arrived, and any other full groups that came in the meantime could take the table we had our eyes on. In principle, this seems like a pretty good system so you don't have groups taking up a table long before they're ready, but I know that when we came in, we were asked if we were a part of a partial group that was... already sitting at a table. I don't mind being told to wait, but not if I know the rules aren't being applied across the board.\n\nYou'll be shocked to hear that by the time our last two people showed up, our table had been taken not five minutes before. We were told we could wait in the lounge area, but we could only have appetizers there and not the regular entrees. Since we had a show to get to, we decided that appetizers would be the best option; there were a lot of choices and many were just smaller plates of the entrees anyways. The group had several orders of twice-cooked fries and beef sliders, and a few people tried the mussels, mac n cheese, and \"Chicken Videe,\" a kind of take on chicken pot pie.

I greatly dislike going out on Valentine's Day, as you're usually surrounded by starry-eyed couples who make me want to throw-up.  We're not old, but the last time we dined out on Valentine's Day was in 2000, when we just started started dating.  So, I was very apprehensive about going out.  \n\nMy husband chose this place, as I LOVE french fries and Belgian beer.  Unfortunately, even through he called in the reservation on Monday, no one mentioned to him that the regular menu would not be available.  Luckily, we found this out on Wednesday when I went to peruse the menu and saw only the set-price four course dinner was the only option available for $60/person.  So, we were not taken-aback when we were seated on Thursday (as some other couples obviously were).\n\nWhen the hostess gave us the menus, she said for $20 more, one could get the suggested beer pairings with each course.   My husband said, so like, 4-6 ounce tastings, and she confirmed yes.  \n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the moules a la biere and the artisanal cheese plate.  Both were huge servings and extremely tasty.  When we received our beer, we were surprised that the specialty glasses were full.  Having not quite finished the complementary glass of prosecco and realizing that we'd be getting four beers each, I said this is going to be a long night.  \n\nLong story short, the experience at La Trappe was wonderful.  Great beer: an extensive list of Belgian and Belgian style beers from around the world (though they are missing the Corsendonk Brown); and great food: huge servings, excellent flavors (we had, in addition to the above-mentioned appetizers, Cream of Ginger Carrot Soup, Harvest Salad with Roquefort toast, the filet with potatoes au gratin and green beans, Ricotta and Spinach Ravioloni, and for dessert, the Chocolate Ganache and Creme Brulee).  \n\nThe service in my opinion was good.   Perhaps it was because we were experiencing a differently paced meal.  But our server was friendly and the busser always kept our water glasses full and cleared our plates.  \n\nThe atmosphere was nice.  It seemed a little off the beaten path of North Beach establishments, so it looked pretty free of touristy type people.  All the tap handles for the different Belgians certainly doesn't detract :-)\n\nWe will definitely be returning.  Hopefully so I can sample some of the frites.

We couldn't pronounce it for the life of us so he wrote them down for us to show the bartender.  Bartender wasn't too friendly, but I suspect it's because his bar was crowded and getting a bit out of control.

We just kept dipping our bread and fries into that gorgeous broth.  The mussels were ridiculously good-  and it didn't cost an arm and leg.

"], "author": "Regina L.", "review": "The vibe and ambiance of La Trappe have changed a lot since my first time there in 2012. Sometimes it's a hit, and sometimes it's a total miss. Given how many different experiences we've had here, it's a bit hard to write this review so I'll break it down the best that I can.\n\n*Ambiance: the restaurant itself is pretty unassuming. When you walk by, the top dining area is usually empty, but if you head downstairs, you find yourself in a grotto-like space where the Belgian beer flows and people get rowdy. At some point a few years ago, they started playing house/techno music downstairs and we stopped going. The vibe is definitely less party-party now, but it hasn't really regained the charm that it had back in the day (or maybe my mind is playing tricks on me - I guess we'll never know). \n\n*Beer: they have a very extensive beer list that comes in the form of a book that is reminiscent of Harry Potter. The beers are categorized really well, and the server is usually really helpful when it comes to choosing what to drink. If you are a beer aficionado or have a very international palette, I highly recommend you come here for a drink. \n\n*Food: the food here is pretty damn good. Their main dishes are mussel or french fry based (try both if you can). The mussels and fries come in/with an array of sauces or dipping sauces respectively, and they also have a variety of traditional Belgian dishes. My two favorite items on the menu are the Boudin Blanc (white sausage with a creamy mustard sauce) and the Ghentse Chicken Waterzooi (chicken stew). It's a hearty, filling meal no matter what you order. \n\n*Service: four out of five times, the service is pretty bad. The downstairs area goes from empty to packed really quickly, and they never seem to have enough staff to handle the influx of customers. We've had forgotten orders and item mix-ups more than a few times, and the wait time for your order can be anywhere from 15 to 40 minutes. The servers usually seem frazzled and more often than not, dirty dishes and empty water glasses litter your table until you ask a passing staff member to clear and/or refill. \n\nLa Trappe has become a place that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to people, but would certainly end up at for a casual Friday evening meal. I would love to see this place get a dose of TLC from management in terms of getting consistent service and a warmer ambiance.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Then we shared the Boudin Blanc (3 white sausages in a mustard sauce with scalloped potatoes).

Wow. \n\nI came by with a close friend on a Friday night, after a full day of marathon boot shopping (for her). \n\nAt 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening, we were able to be sat immediately. *Cartwheels!  In fact, one of the things I liked the most about LT was that it was not uncomfortably crowded. We were able to enjoy our evening in peace, relatively speaking. \n\nWe sat downstairs, which definitely embraces an old school pub atmosphere. If I could picture what the inside of the shire looks like, this would be it. It's warm, dark, old and wooden. Nothing fancy. \n\nThe beer menu is frakking epic. I normally fear no beer, and certainly no beer menu, to be sure, but I must admit that with 400 imported beers and a beer menu exceeding 35 pages, I was a little flummoxed. But fear not, friends, your server knows what SHE'S doing (*throws another wrench into assumption that beer drinking is a man's sport). If you tell her what you normally like, she can walk you through it and make recommendations based on your tastes.\n\nWe started with a traditional lambic, moved on to a red, and finished with a very sweet lambic. We shared bottled import beers, which I strongly recommend because you can try more that way (and you drink less as well). With such an enormous beer list, you're going to want to try a few and figure out what you like (and don't like). Don't forget, practically everything is imported, so even the most seasoned American beer drinker might run into questions. Again, the staff knows what they're doing, so please ask. \n\nFood wise, we started with the ratatouille, which I was only lukewarm about ordering--but it turned out to be delicious!  It was flavorful, fresh and healthy. Then we shared the Boudin Blanc (3 white sausages in a mustard sauce with scalloped potatoes). The BB was a lot lighter than I expected.  It was so good--my companion was like, \"Please, make me stop eating this.\" So I took my plate and put it on top of the BB, and was about to signal our server to remove the plates when my friend removed my plate and continued eating. Well then! It was that good. \n\nWe were physically unable to do dessert. So full. \n\nFor three bottled import beers, ratatouille and BB, it was about $70, which isn't too bad for dinner in SF.

I came here during SF Beer week and sampled cheeses with beer pairings (oh man, I feel so refined). If you are intimidated by their album of a menu, stick to the first page. Their draft beers have never steered me wrong (Except for that one time a friend of mine ordered a beer that was very reminiscent of soy sauce. But 1/25 beers I've tasted here is not a terrible ratio). \n\nThe food here is also delicious, but avoid the burgers because I feel they're not up to the same standard as the rest of their food. Mussels + fries are delicious. The fries come with two dipping sauces, so choose wisely! I like wasabi mayo and curry ketchup, but to be honest, I haven't tried every sauce yet. The boudin blanc is also amazing.

He did a beer trip to Belgium two years ago. He is a bit of a fanatic when it comes to beer...so if I can take him to a place where he can order some of his favorite beers (some on tap) and they come in the beers own special glass-five stars for making him smile. \n\n2. Service. We arrived at 6pm on a Friday night and went straight downstairs. We picked a small table for the two of us. Our server, at tall beautiful gal, explained a couple of changes on the menu to us. She was very attentive and kind. Towards the end of our meal the place was packed and I was worried that the service was going to go south but I started to realize that other people were helping her. Moving plates on and off the table, refilling waters etc. All the staff worked as a team to keep everyone happy and that really impressed me-5 stars.\n\n3. Food...We had a cheese plate. 2 cheeses were $12 dollars. Typically when we order cheese you get such a small amount. NOT HERE. Holy Queso my friends! There was so much cheese as well as grapes, honey, dates, olives, gherkins and this delicious dark nutty bread. My husband had the lasagna which was moist and very tasty. It wasn't an Italian lasagna but was very flavorful and a welcome surprise. I order The Boudin Blanc. Dear god. There are no words. The sausage was amazing, the gratin was cheesy and flavorful...bring it all together with the sauce and it's like an orgasm in your mouth! 5 stars!\n\n4. They have Duchesse Du Bourgogne on tap. This alone gets the place 5 stars. Not many people are into Flemish Sour Ales but I am. I didn't see anyone else order one that night.

Either way you're going to have excellent beers, hearty food, and great ambiance; it's simply a question of how long you want to wait for it.\n\nYou can eat upstairs, but I recommend the basement, with its rustic brick walls, dim lighting, and bar crowd that provides an ideal locale for good company and beer. On a weeknight the sound level is perfect for conversations while still feeling decently full. On weekends, I recently waited an hour for a table (no reservations accepted) and it was uncomfortably crowded and more suitable for drinking than dinner. \n\nNonetheless, the meal was superbly satisfying once it arrived. In true Belgian form, they specialize in moules frites (mussels and french fries) which are served up in many different forms - classic mariniere (beer sauce), provencal, spicy tomato, and an alternative coconut curry sauce. They're all served with two dipping sauces you get to choose (wasabi mayo, roasted red pepper aioli, etc.) I've also had the boudin blanc sausage, which was served in a tasty mustard sauce over a potato leek gratin. The cheese plates are also a good starter.\n\nOf course you're really coming for the beer list, which is extensive. A good number on tap, and many many more to choose from. I buy a number of Belgian beers from Whole Foods and I must say, however, that La Trappe does mark up their prices considerably.

It wasn't until we walked in that we realized all the activity was downstairs in the basement where we saw a lot of chugging and guzzling underway.\n\nWe secured a table for two and noticed yes, they serve food, too. We knew we had to have the $8 Belgian Fries since we just assumed it was a house specialty. It came with our choice of two dipping sauces, so we tried the Roasted Garlic Mayo and the Belgian Mayo which had a tangier flavor from the white wine vinegar (photo: http://bit.ly/2fRjNSO). It definitely held us over as we waited for our appetizer. I ordered the $10 Vegetable Tart for us, a nice surprise with slices of zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, and tomato with herbs, lemon and melted goat cheese on a flatbread pastry shell (photo: http://bit.ly/2feJ3yO).\n\nThat was a much lighter treat than you would expect from an underground pub. For his entree, Jamie was a bit adventurous and had the $18 Ghentse Chicken Waterzooi, which looked like a creamy soup except it was centered around pieces of chicken, fennel, celery and onion. A Dutch specialty originating in Flanders, it was actually more of a stew with a soup base made of egg yolk, cream and thickened vegetable broth. The fries had yet another place for dipping beyond the double mayos (photo: http://bit.ly/2fvmMfq).\n\nI went all traditional and ordered the classic $16 Mussels Mariniere bathing in white wine and butter filled with thyme, onions, shallots, garlic and parsley (photo: http://bit.ly/2esTmxw).

The steak was cut into strips, making it a very share-able plate. It was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The fries were, as mentioned above, fry-perfection.\n-The grand finale, my favorite dish of the day: GHENTSE CHICKEN WATERZOOI, a traditional light Belgian Mary's organic chicken stew with cream, potatoes, carrots, onion, and celery. TRUST ME PLEASE, THIS IS INSANELY GOOD. I did not expect this to blow me away, but it was creamy, just sweet enough from the aromatics, hearty without being heavy, and had such a unique flavor.

La Trappe was just a short walk down the hill from our hotel, which was incredibly convenient.\n\nUpon arriving you walk right into the kitchen/small restaurant area where the host told us to head downstairs for drinks and dinner. The downstairs area has no windows, but is dark and cozy, making for a great dinner and/or date spot. We were promptly greeted by our waiter who gave us the impressively long beer list and let us browse through it for a solid 10-15 minutes before checking back on us. It was hard to narrow down our selections, but my boyfriend and I went with a draft tripel and a saison, both of which we were happy with. \n\nAs we were sipping on our beers, we put in an order for the charcuterie plate. While this was being prepared the waiter brought us over some freshly made bread with butter. The bread was absolutely delicious--very soft and flavorful on the inside with a nice contrasting crunch of the crust. The charcuterie plate arrived a short time thereafter, which I was thankful for as we had done quite a number on the bread basket.  The charcuterie plate provided a great variety of delicious items, including cured duck sausage, garlic salami and pork rillette with a side of pickled onion and bell peppers. My favorites were the duck sausage and the salami, and the vegetables were slightly pickled which gave a nice contrast between the freshness of the vegetables and the vinegar flavor. I'd highly recommend getting this as a starter as it went wonderfully with our Belgian brews.\n\nFor the main plates, we decided to split two items, the first being the Birds Nest which was a trio of organic beef meatballs, breaded and deep fried with hard boiled quail egg in center and topped with a tomato based sauce. These were fantastic as all of the flavors complimented one another while standing out individually. The beef was flavorful and well seasoned and the richness of the quail egg was outstanding. They weren't overly breaded as many places tend to do and the frying process didn't rob the meatball of its unique flavor. As for our second dish, we went with the Mussels Mariniere which was cooked with shallots and onion that were sauteed in white wine, witbier, butter, creme fraiche and parsley served with fries and two dipping sauces of our choice. I absolutely adored this dish. The mussels were tender and soaked up all the flavors of the wine and witbier, and a silence descended upon our table as we enjoyed these. The frites were perfectly crispy and dipping sauces (Chipotle BBQ Mayo and Roasted Red Pepper) were great additions to the dish. I have no complaints whatsoever about the meal!\n\nWe finished our dining experience with another saison and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. It wasn't bad, but it fell short when compared to other tiramisus that I've had in the past. The dessert was a bit dry and lacked the almost overpoweringly strong coffee/espresso flavors.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and food came out promptly, so I have no complaints there.\n\nLa Trappe is definitely worth the visit, so if you're in the mood for frites, Belgian Beers, and mussels, definitely check this place out.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Husband and I enjoyed the mariniere, a beer and lemon broth.

We never burdened them with our problem. We just kept on getting cozier and cozier as more people came. And we asked people around us for empty chairs and everyone around us was totally cool about it (afterall, no tables crammed like we did; most tables that seat four comfortably were occupied by two people.) And it's not like the late-comers didn't order anything and just took up space. \n\nMaybe the staff is just over worked, so the mere thought of having to rearrange chairs after we leave got them all riled up. In the entire basement, there was one waitress and one guy who waited AND acted as the host. \n\nThe food came out pretty slow after we ordered, but it was okay because everyone was enjoying their beers. Most of us got the moules et frites for $17. I got moules mariniere which was a bit overcooked. I chose spicy ketchup and curry ketchup as my condiments for the fries and spicy ketchup reminded me of sriracha sauce. Fries were fine, but I am not sure if you can really mess up fries. \n\nDespite the mediocre food and grumpy service, there were a couple of highlights of La Trappe. We came with a friend who is Belgian and he totally endorsed it. He had been here before and thought the food was authentic. And he licked his bowl of rabbit stew clean, so it must have been good. \n\nThe restaurant itself is super cute. The basement is a bit stuffy, but still really spacious and comfortable for a basement. The lighting was great: not too bright, not too dim. \n\nThe beer selection is outstanding. They have a whole binder of choices and have (if i remember correctly) 19 beers on tap. It reminds me of my favorite hang out when I lived in Lyon, this cozy bar called La palais de la biere where our manly friends can enjoy brews that are way too bitter for me, and I can enjoy a very girlie framboise bierre. And I don't think SF has places like this, so this really fills a void for all the beer lovers here. \n\nSo, if you want to impress your beer connoisseur friends (don't bring more than 3) while munch on some Belgian food, this is a perfect and chill place.

He just wanted something laid-back with tasty food. I knew that he liked beer, and wanted some place quiet-ish for us to relax and chat while we ate dinner as well. La Trappe has over 200 different types of bottled beer, and about 30 on tap. They do serve wine as well, but that seems rather, well...stupid. \n\nWe walked in, and noticed about six tables upstairs, and asked if we could go and seat ourselves downstairs. You walk down, and are in this cozy warm lit space that has a bar, several tables set up, and a back space that was being used for what looked like a little party going on. We decided to sit at the bar, as there were 2 seats next to each other on the end, and it was obvious that no tables were going to free up anytime soon in the larger space. We were almost snuggled up right under the stairs, and we were quickly handed the beer book and their 1 page menu after being greeted by one of the beermen. I was totally overwhelmed by the list, and The Boy seemed pretty impressed as well. \nI actually managed to wade through a bit of the beer book and select something, and we ordered the sliders as a starter. My suggestion? Get the sliders. You can thank me later.\n\nThe beer man that helped us was so wonderful at giving us some of his time (as it quickly became PACKED within 15 minutes of us sitting down) in explaining the different kinds of beer, why they cleaned certain glasses and not others, and the types of glassware that they used at the bar. He did check in with us from time to time, but not so often that we felt smothered. I ordered the mussels and frites, and The Boy ordered the black cod. My food came pretty quickly, and as we sat and waited for his food (and nibbled at my fries), they realized that the fish order hadn't gone in, and quickly put it in with their apologies. No worries, we said, and they got that order down to us in lightening time. We ordered 2 more beers at this point, and the one The Boy picked the beerman said had a very distinct, almost sour taste, and let him taste it (since it was on tap), and let him choose something else to finish off his meal with. \n\nWhile obviously, this place is about the Beer, the food is certainly not to be missed. My mussels (which I ordered in the Mariniere style), were of a generous portion, and the fries were hot and crisp and consistant in size and style. They were also well seasoned - where they were not too salty, nor did they need any additional work should you so desire to eat them plain. They also come with 2 of their dips. The Black Cod (which is now off the menu, sucks to be you) was served with some potatoes and veggies, and was cooked pretty much to perfection; I remember it being moist and fresh seafood flavorful. It really was high end pub style food. \n\nWhile it did get busy, it never seemed like I was shouting at The Boy  in order to have a conversation with him, though we did have to cozy up to each other at the bar to let other people get in and order. When we asked for the bill, our beerman has comped one of our rounds of beer since we had to wait for the fish (which was almost the price of the dish anyways). They quickly processed our order, and we got out the door for a very reasonable dinner about for the amount of food and drink we consumed. \n\nKeep in mind that the beer here is not cheap - you won't be getting any $5 PBR. Be nice, be patient, and enjoy.

Either way you're going to have excellent beers, hearty food, and great ambiance; it's simply a question of how long you want to wait for it.\n\nYou can eat upstairs, but I recommend the basement, with its rustic brick walls, dim lighting, and bar crowd that provides an ideal locale for good company and beer. On a weeknight the sound level is perfect for conversations while still feeling decently full. On weekends, I recently waited an hour for a table (no reservations accepted) and it was uncomfortably crowded and more suitable for drinking than dinner. \n\nNonetheless, the meal was superbly satisfying once it arrived. In true Belgian form, they specialize in moules frites (mussels and french fries) which are served up in many different forms - classic mariniere (beer sauce), provencal, spicy tomato, and an alternative coconut curry sauce. They're all served with two dipping sauces you get to choose (wasabi mayo, roasted red pepper aioli, etc.) I've also had the boudin blanc sausage, which was served in a tasty mustard sauce over a potato leek gratin. The cheese plates are also a good starter.\n\nOf course you're really coming for the beer list, which is extensive. A good number on tap, and many many more to choose from. I buy a number of Belgian beers from Whole Foods and I must say, however, that La Trappe does mark up their prices considerably. But if you're coming for these calibers of beer, you probably weren't expecting anything cheap anyhow.\n\nMy friend likened his last experience to coming into a small Belgian tavern for some hearty food and tasty beer to escape the winter cold.
