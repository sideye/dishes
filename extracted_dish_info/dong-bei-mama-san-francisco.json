Features a warm crispy flaky chewy scallion pancake that encloses fresh cucumber and cilantro with a hoisin-marinated melt-in-the-mouth beef. This thing is huge and is as long as my fore arm!\n\n2) Honey Walnut Shrimp ($13.98): Nice crunch to the honey walnut shrimp due to the crispy and light batter.

"], "author": "James Z.", "review": "I will admit I've only been to a small handful of Chinese restaurants in the city, but I've tried enough to say that this is my favorite spot in the Inner Richmond. Located on always-busy Geary Blvd., Dong Bei Mama is a place you can't miss. The name alone is very memorable! I've dined in several times and each time I am reminded why I enjoy Chinese food so much. So let me get straight into a discussion about the food... In sum: it's fabulous!\n\nI have two favorites: their beef scallion wrap. This burrito-shaped cylinder can easily feed two for a meal or four as an appetizer. Thinly cut beef (with a little fat), scallion, and cucumber are sandwiched between a delicious fried Chinese pancake batter. Despite it being fried, somehow, it also tastes refreshing thanks to the veggies. The dried sauteed string beans is another not-to-miss dish. This is one of my favorite Chinese dishes and they do it very well at Dong Bei Mama. I recently tried their spicy beef noodle soup, and yes, it's very spicy -- at least for me. Each spoonful of the soup kicks you in the mouth. Their honey walnut shrimp is also quite good. And for some reason, I really enjoy the jasmine tea they brew. It's more floral than most complimentary jasmine teas at other restaurants.\n\nThe service is not bad. They're always friendly... might be forgetful at times (like bringing water or extra napkins out upon request)... but the food is too good for me to knock them for that. Plus, the prices... for San Francisco standards, this place is pretty reasonable. For example: a recent meal where I ordered the wrap, the string beans, and the soup came out to ~$22 (before tip). Oh, and a quick tip... they are very busy during weekday (and presumably weekend) lunch hours. At Noon, it's suddenly full and then by 1, it's mostly cleared out. Luckily the restaurant can hold quite a bit of people. \n\nNeedless to say, I recommend Dong Bei Mama and I continue to return for their consistently delicious dishes!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-05-14"}], "fish fillet in sweet and sour sauce": [], "steamed fish fillet with tofu in chili sauce": [], "steamed flounder": [], "panfried flounder": [], "yushiang shrimp": [], "sweet and sour shrimp": [], "sauteed clam in black bean sauce": [], "spare ribs over rice": [], "braised pork over rice": [], "three seafood delicacies over rice in curry sauce": [], "minced pork over rice": [{"excerpts": ["Love the minced pork over rice too.
