A little pricey but so worth is (especially if you're a huge seafood fan like myself).\n\nGarlic Crab ($32.96)\nI have NEVER been to a place that gives you THIS much crab. There is a TON of crab. You can get full of just this dish alone eating only the crab legs. Huge portion with HUGE flavors. Awesome.\n\nClam Chowder (Bowl) ($5.50)\nHighly recommended. Nice and creamy, but the best part is that it's CHUNKY. Lots of clams and potatoes (just the way I like it).\n\nGarlic Bread ($5.50)\nTHIS IS A MUST! They use ACTUAL garlic on top of the bread. It's amazing. It's a huge hit on Yelp, and now I can see why.\n\nOverall, I'm in love with this place (especially the Garlic Bread, Clam Chowder, and Garlic Crab). My one knock is that we waited an hour (literally) for our food once we ordered. Given it was a busy Saturday evening, an hour is still a little too long no matter where anyone goes.

We walked in at 6pm on a friday night and were seated right away. The service was great. I actually only wanted oysters, but ended up being really impressed with the food. We ordered the two items most reviews recommended- the cioppino and pasta with prawns. \n\nThe cioppino was the best cioppino Ive ever had and Im not over exaggerating either. The amount of seafood was more than generous. The portion was perfect for 2 people- maybe even 3 because we had left overs. But it would definitely be way too much for 1 person. It comes with 2 pieces of delicious garlic bread, but I guarantee youll have to order more to dip in that cioppino. A half order of garlic bread is 2 pieces and a full is 4. Do yourself a favor and just get a full order. \n\nThe daily pasta w/praws with the roasted garlic, white wine sauce was also delicious! I never usually finish pasta entrees but this one I did. The size of the praws were huge and there were maybe 8 pieces. This pasta really exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe ordered Fanny Bay Oysters and I have to admit that of all the places Ive ordered these, this place had the biggest fanny bays Ive ever had. They were very meaty!\n\nIt was our first time at this restaurant and was even going to order a Calamari but our server was kind enough to warn us that we had plenty of food already with the cioppino and should hold of. Im glad she did that because we didnt even finish the cioppino. \n\nMy server told us this place has been open about 2.5 years but had just went through a renovation. The sign outside was changed and its been attracting a lot more business. Well it worked for me because I always saw their sign on my way to Boba Guys. When we stepped out of the restaurant, we literally heard 3 different couples walking by saying \"Oh cool, whats this Oyster Bar?\". Obviously, the new sign and renovation was just what this place needs. \n\nI really didnt expect much from this place because I havent heard much about this place, but my experience totally exceeded my expectations. I have to admit, as I first sat down I decided that if I was still hungry and not satisfied with the food here I would head over to Hog & Rocks after. Well, I sure didnt need to do that!

We started with oysters, which are $2 per oyster all weekend long!  The selection included six varied oysters, including Kumamotos, my personal favorite.  The oysters were expertly shucked - no shell or mangling at all - which is sadly pretty rare, even among places that profess to be oyster specialists. \n\nWe ordered the frutti di mare - clams, mussels, green mussels, fish, prawns, and crab in a white wine garlic sauce.  Each piece of seafood was amazingly fresh, tender, and well-flavored.  The dish was packed with seafood goodness, and our table of three probably could have shared it and gone home happy.  Instead, we also ordered the pasta with prawns in a white wine, tomato, and basil sauce and the cod special.

Believe it or not, I prefer it a little watery since it tastes closer to the sea that way, but I wasn't complaining except they charge extra for bread and butter. Good thing it came with two baggies of oyster crackers which I used as a crunchy topping (photo: http://bit.ly/1xUgv0U).\n\nSo finally the Cioppino. A big flat bowl arrived with a pair of crusty garlic toast wedges on top. The rich red broth was slopping over the edge as there was an aquarium of shellfish: little neck clams, manila clams, mussels, huge prawns, crab legs, squid rings. All of it festooned with lemon slices and pepper (photo: http://bit.ly/11kTiJE). Pretty darn delicious though quite a chore to get through all the shells without getting the requisite bib. I'm the type that needs a bib for egg drop soup. I'm a splasher. For the plethora of bivalves and such, it was still no Swan Oyster Depot when it came to freshness, and I have to admit even the big bowl of fresh-off-the-ice sea life in the cioppino at Phil's Fish Market at Moss Landing still lingers in the memory. But hey, I'm coming back 'cause it's close.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...plentiful cioppino, quite a variety of shellfish\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...didn't scream fish house to me\nSERVICE - 3 stars...attentive at first but wavered as my meal went on and on\nTOTAL - 4 stars...come here for the cioppino if you don't want to hang in North Beach", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-20"}, {"excerpts": ["My ultimate favorites: fish and chips, scallops, shrimp cocktail, oysters and clam chowder (soo thick, creamy and yummy).

They offer 3 varieties on oysters.  When I was there, they were: Chesapeake, French Kiss and Miyagi.  My most favorite one was the Chesapeake!  It had a distinct, seawater flare that I liked about it very much.  The French Kiss and Miyagi does so as well, but it wasn't as strong as the Chesapeake.\n\nIt was $2 per oyster when we went there during non-happy hours.  Happy hours are everyday and even weekends, between 3pm-6pm.  When you get there for happy hour, it is a buck per oyster.  I would totally go on a weekend between those hours!  \n\nThey offer other seafood entrees as well, but nothing really captivated my attention besides the raw oysters.

A quick Google search and I found hundreds of websites and blogs with people professing their hatred for them. Geez, harsh much? Admittedly, I'm not a fan of hipsters yet I regularly find myself in \"the\" hipster mecca of San Francisco: The Mission. \n\nI'm such a hypocrite. So does that make me a hipster too? \n\nIf only I could shoe horn my way into skinny jeans without looking like I have a camel toe. Anyhow...\n\nHipster mecca aside, The Mission is the breeding ground for the newest and hottest restaurants in San Francisco. Instead of going to Hog Island at the Ferry Building, my friends and I decided to check out the new oyster bar in The Mission for happy hour. \n\nWe were disappointed. My friends suggested 2 stars but I'll be nice and round up. \n\nI absolutely adore Anchor Oyster Bar (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco#hrid:p84AaAmuoJL-9jFCU8Esfg) and after reading that Mission Street Oyster Bar's owner worked there for 18+ years, I expected the same caliber in terms of food quality especially with their Fisherman Wharf prices. Not only was the food lackluster, the service was unorganized and snail paced, and the tacky teal ambiance left little to be desired.   \n\nIt seems the owner bought a taqueria and just added two flat screen TVs. Viola! A hipster \"oyster bar\" is born. Mission Oyster Bar is not an \"oyster bar\" per say as there's no seafood display and all the shucking is done in the kitchen in the back. It's very bare boned and all the empty space makes it uninviting. \n\nThe Happy Hour menu (everyday 3 pm - 6 pm) consists of $1 oysters (3 varieties), $2.50 draft beers, and one house wine for $7.  \n\nFour solid stars for the fresh oysters and offering three varieties: Fannie Mae, Chesapeake Bay and Miyagi (my fav) http://bit.ly/XiwjZk. DO COME FOR THE OYSTERS! They were super silky and sweet but a mignonette would have been better than the accompanying cocktail sauce. Kudos to Mission Oyster Bar's awesome oyster supplier. Unfortunately, all the praising stops there. \n\nWe decided to order a small sampling of the menu in the event we wanted to come back for dinner. The Clam Chowder ($5.50) tasted generic http://bit.ly/Y3999u. It was watery, bland, and there was barely any clams in it. Not only did it take 45 minutes to arrive, it arrived lukewarm. The much raved about Garlic Bread ($4.95) wasn't garlicky and was over toasted to a hard crouton http://bit.ly/YzSDwQ. The mediocre Dungeness Crab Cakes ($11.95) were made with minced crab meat not lump crab and similar to what I've bought at Trader Joe's http://bit.ly/15iWUZB. \n\nAnd then there's the service. The restaurant is understaffed and the staff lacks training. One waitress for 10 tables and the bar is not enough. We were never given basic things like plates, forks or spoons nor were any of the oysters described; they were just plopped onto our table. Our additional rounds of oysters were wrong (we wanted miyagis only) and came without lemon and oyster forks. Again, there was the 45 minute wait for lukewarm clam chowder which is inexcusable after two reminders to our waitress and one of the chefs.\n\nAfter being opened for 2 months, I would have expected for Mission Street Oyster Bar to have ironed out major kinks. Seems like they haven't. \n\nI will leave Mission Street Oyster Bar for the hipsters to have at it....", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-02-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Fresh oysters, helpful waitress.
