The price tag is steep, but I would definitely recommend it and personally would dine here again and again - some things are just worth it! The food is amazing and I will get there in just a minute, but I have to say - thank you to the staff who all acknowledged and congratulated us on our engagement, for the card they all signed which was really the sweetest touch, and for giving us literally the best seats in the house (front nearest the kitchen, and unbeknownst to us, next to the owners of Elizabeth in Chicago - who were the loveliest people and made our experience even greater!). No amount of words could really do this place justice and I'm not sure any other establishment could ever top this one! \n\nThe restaurant is set up for communal dining which is just a fantastic way to meet people and this concept works so well in SF one of the most friendly and progressive cities in the country! Additionally, there is a set menu, which alleviates the need to think/decide what you might want. Everyone enjoys the same food (like a family!) and of course they can accommodate for any food restrictions. We loved all the small bites upstairs before our seating (and the welcome cocktail was seriously addictive, we may have asked for a second..!), and all the dishes after were impeccable. \n\nUpstairs, the grilled foie gras (with blood orange marmalade), and the crab toast were divine and the whipped scrambled eggs was so interesting and delicious! They had this fried mushroom which was really good too (and is actually served at their new bar/restaurant True Laurel). Downstairs, the clam dish had me reeling, and who doesn't enjoy some cultured butter?! The halibut was lovely and the rack of lamb to end it was great too! I was already full by the time dessert came around (altogether they serve about 12-14 dishes). If it's your first time I would recommend a wine pairing! My fiance and I shared one and it was a good amount for us both! You can browse and get up to look at the kitchen, talk to your neighbors, staff etc. that is all encouraged!  \n\nThe idea and planning behind Lazy Bear really makes a visit here not just a place for dinner, but a full experience for all members involved. One lady we met said it was her 3rd time here and she should return again (me too!). Every experience is different, menu items change, and they are constantly improving! They are so deserving of all the michelin stars and awards they have received. I just cannot praise this establishment enough.

Geoduck clam with sorrels, watermelon radish and oro blanco (3/5) - decent geoduck dish but I was just at Coi and their geoduck dish was better.\n(3).  White asparagus with Tsar Nicoulai caviar (4/5) - this dish is good but I've had something similar at Quince not so long ago and that was better.\n(4).  Ham and barley broth with fudgy egg yolk, pink lady apple and charred onion (5/5) - this was the perfect intermezzo and special mention to the consistency and creaminess of the egg yolk. \n(5).  Local halibut with artichoke, stinging nettle, ramps and hollandaise (5/5) - Perfection. No other words to describe it. \n(6).  Grilled rack of lamb with broccolini and kumquat (5/5) - this is, by far, the best piece of lamb I've had and I particularly enjoyed the fat. Surprisingly, the veggies were competing well with the lamb in this dish.  \n(7).  Rhubarb compote with coconut cream and sorrel granita (3/5) - I've had a better version of what this is trying to do at Campton Place (using kiwi instead of rhubarb). \n(8).  Honey with banana and walnut (1/5) - this was not good at all. The banana really overpowered this. A nice chocolate mille-feuille or ice cream/sorbet would have been perfect in this spot. \n(9).  Forager's Tisane Tea (5/5) - really happy with this at the end of the savory courses and while eating the desserts. \n(10).  Mignardises include calamansi lime/Fresno Chile gummi bear, dark chocolate brownie, prickly pear macaron and almond/chocolate/pink peppercorn nugget (5/5) - these are the most unique and tasty small bites I've had in SF and kudos for the creativity. \n\nIn terms of what was missing, I wish they somehow incorporated black truffle in the meal.

When I heard they'd opened a storefront, I cheered on the inside. Then came the first Michelin star. Then the second. Now, 7 years later, I was practically salivating in anticipation of finally visiting them again, but I wasn't sure what to expect. Had they lost the magic and enthusiasm of back when they were a pop up working out of random warehouses?\n\nThe answer is emphatically no. I have had the privilege of dining at several Michelin star restaurants in California (Meadowood, Manresa, The French Laundry, Sushi Yoshizumi...), and they are mostly excellent, fine dining experiences. Lazy Bear is that and more. When my friend and I arrived, we were enthusiastically greeted by the bartender, who escorted us upstairs to their waiting area. We were shown to a cozy nook over the balcony, giving us a birds eye view of the dining that was still going on below. Our server was pleasant and helpful with picking out cocktails, and suggested amazing, unique cocktails unlike anything I've ever had before. This was followed by \"fruit punch,\" which was supposed to be alcoholic but didn't taste like it at all (so dangerous!), and a whole slew of \"snack,\" including whipped scrambled eggs, geoduck clam, crispy big head, crab toast, and crispy hen of the woods. After this very pleasant opener, we were then escorted downstairs where we were served spelt and rye dinner roll (complete with their own housemade butter, with their own culture they are clearly very proud of), Mt. Lassen trout and roe, sunflower (which was sunchoke, sourdough, and caviar), ham & barley broth, San Francisco coast halibut, and aged duck. After that came the dessert course: Meyer lemon (with buttermilk and pine), candy cap (maple and cranberry), and a platter of delightful treats (gummy bear, macaron, banana bread, and peanut butter pebble). We also paired this with their reserve wine pairing. I have only had one other wine pairing (at Manresa), but Lazy Bear's was even better than Manresa's. Each wine was smooth and perfectly matched the course; highlights were their champagne and assyrtiko.\n\nEach course was so well done and delicious, but the standout for me is the whole Lazy Bear experience. The tables are giant communal tables to encourage the \"dinner party\" feel, which is just how their pop up functioned. The kitchen is right there for you to watch all the chefs hard at work, and David Barzelay (rearrange the letters of his last name to get \"Lazy Bear\") himself will announce some of the courses as well as help serve guests. Everyone is friendly and enthusiastic about their work, and guests are encouraged to walk up to the kitchen to observe them at work. They also thoughtfully provided swivel chairs, so you can pivot to hear them announce the courses, as well as chat with your neighbors. And since I was there celebrating my birthday, I was also presented with a birthday card, signed by all the staff.\n\nIn summary, I absolutely loved the entire experience, and I really appreciated how, despite their increased profile (PBS was there filming a special), they have maintained their friendly, approachable, but still extremely fine dining experience.

The entire experience lasted 4 hours.\n\n\nAMBIANCE AND EXPERIENCE - 3\nHonestly, it felt like I'd scored a ticket to a party I wasn't cool enough to attend. The space is flawlessly decorated to be young and playful, yet cozy and sophisticated. However, the 'interactive dinner party' aspect fell flat for me. It definitely did feel like a dinner party, but it felt awkward chatting with others, especially as most guests stuck close to their own groups. We didn't meet anyone until after the 8th course when the woman next to us was a little sauced (granted, we also didn't make an effort to introduce ourselves).\n\nFOOD -  5\nInventive and unique. The chefs are surprisingly young but dedicated to their craft, both in the detailed execution and their bold experimentation. A chef introduces each course as the plates are served, all of which are plated beautifully like a work of art. The food itself definitely pushed my comfort zone; in a single evening, I ate caviar, trout roe, and baby pigeon. All of the savory dishes leaned on the salty side. The entire experience lasted 4 hours and we left completely stuffed.\n\n* Cocktails: Pricey, but excellent. Perfectly balanced. I tried the Peaches and Cream, and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.\n\n* Snacks: All served during the mezzanine cocktail hour. Loved the scrambled eggs and mushrooms.\n   - Whipped Scrambled Eggs with maple syrup and housemade hot sauce\n   - Trout Tartare with grilled squash, yolk jam, and preserves\n   - Marin Miyagi Oyster with grape and elderflower\n   - Tempura mushrooms with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche dip\n\n* Main Courses:\n   - Dinner rolls - Housemade butter from a 2+ year culture. Fresh, warm, and complementary second helpings.\n   - Channel Islands Halibut with chicory, pomegranate, and pine nuts - Good. Creative blend of flavors, creamy finish.\n   - Sourdough Dumplings with caviar and seaweed - Excellent. Personally, not a fan of the caviar.\n   - Abalone with little gem, onion, sprouts, and grains - Unfortunately, this was not a hit with us. My boyfriend described it as having \"the look and taste of vomit\". I didn't feel quite so strongly, but it definitely leaned on the acidic side.\n   - Trout with cabbage, buttermilk, and dill - Perfectly paired with the buttermilk cabbage. Beautiful texture and balance. One of the standout dishes of the night.\n   - Corn with pork jowl, kale, and egg yolk fudge - One of my favorites. This was a soup, similar to ramen (but no noodles). Again, a beautiful blend of textures and flavors.\n   - Dry-aged Squab with smoky beets, huckleberry, and pink peppercorn - Also known as baby pigeon. My negative feelings about pigeons made it hard to enjoy this dish, but hey, you only live once.\n\n* Desserts:\n   - Apple with ice cream, hibiscus, and brown sugar - Delicious and refreshing. Not too sweet.\n   - Squash, chocolate, maple, coffee - Excellent, very autumnal. My favorite of the two \"main\" desserts.\n   - Bergamot gummy bears - Very intense flavor, interesting accent with the olive oil.\n   - Lavender Macarons with plum jam - Delicious. Perfect balance of texture and flavor. My favorite of the desserts overall.\n   - Peanut butter pebbles - Just ok.\n\n\nSERVICE - 5\nExcellent service. Every staff member was courteous and helpful. They surprised us with a beautiful card signed by the entire staff for our anniversary. They encourage you to go up to the kitchen and talk to the chefs, but honestly, it felt awkward because it seemed like we were in the way and just being distracting. It's still interesting to watch the chefs from a distance as they hover over the dishes, carefully placing flower petals and other delicate elements with care.

The first was two years ago, shortly after they secured this location and before any stars were given. Fast-forward two years, two Michelin stars, and a more expensive menu later, I am still madly in love.\n\nLazy Bear shows that high-end dining can feel like a dinner party. It is very different from the formal (and sometimes stuffy), upscale white-tablecloth service you get at The French Laundry or Quince. There's a place and time for that traditional setting but Lazy Bear's informal mezzanine snack reception, communal table seating that encourages diners to meet each other, open kitchen with friendly cooks who want to share their craft, a \"field guide\" menu that allows you to take notes as you go on your journey, and the incredible creative use of local ingredients puts the experience in a league of its own.\n\nI'm going to refrain from going through a full review of the menu since the dishes change often. I will say that the whipped scrambled eggs is one of their signatures and it's light, fluffy, and yummy. Another standout in the snacks category was the fried maitake mushrooms. I'm not sure what they did here but I would've gladly eaten an entree portion of this dish. The abalone I had this time was the best abalone I've ever tasted. Chinese people love abalone at banquets but they are often big, chewy, and unappetizing. This was not the case at all at Lazy Bear. It was tender, flavorful, and paired with the crunchy texture of greens. Another one of my favorites was the creamsical dessert. It was covered in white chocolate and everyone around me absolutely loved it.\n\nThere are two seatings a night and I would highly recommend the 6pm seating since the meal takes about 3 hours to complete. I can't imagine eating until 11:30pm if you choose the later time. Also, the snacked are served first and the sit-down portion of the meal doesn't start until ~6:45pm so it's not too early. The prices now vary depending on the day of week. I didn't mind going on a Tuesday, which is the most budget-friendly choice.\n\nI've never done the wine pairing and I do think it's a bit pricey relative to the cost of the food.

I have included pictures of all items for appetizers, main course and desert for your reference.\n- Whipped scrambled eggs 10/10: This was my favorite appetizer and apparently is a \"constant\" for all seasons when you go to lazy bear. For my wife, the eggs were substituted by potatoes. The taste was insane, and the texture frothy. I really wish they could have served more of this.\n- Savory Custard 6/10\n- Grilled celery (smoked) 9/10: I could have never imagined celery can taste this good. \n- Cauliflower + cheese toast on sourdough bread: 8/10\n- Crispy mushroom of the woods with sour cream and Alliums dip 9/10\n\nExcept for the savory custard, all the other appetizers were outstanding.\n\nWe then proceeded to the main hall for the main course:\n- Bread and butter 8/10: The butter is a house made cultured butter that is very savory and tart. It pairs really nicely with the bread and you can ask for as many servings of butter and bread as you desire.\n- Kohlrabi and its roe 6/10: For me, I didn't like the taste of this dish. It felt a bit too bland.\n- Sunflower 9/10: Phenomenal dish. I loved the crunch, the mushroom flavor and the excellent presentation\n- Barley broth with egg yolk 8/10: I really liked this dish, the egg yolk was quite dense and the barley was quite cruncy. The broth was rich and very complex\n- Artichoke chips and black truffle 8.5/10: The artichoke was really creamy and rich and paired well with the hollaindaise sauce.\n- Cheese with barley grain 7.5/10: I rally liked the crispy leaves on this dish. Overall the barley was cheesy, creamy and savory\n- Rhubarb 6/10: This was a cold dish with a sorbet and coconut ice cream. It was sweet and sour.\n- Candy Cap 8/10: This is a special mushroom that was shaped as a donut and is naturally sweet with a maple syrup flavor. Loved it.\n- Treats: These were an assortment of treats at the end. I liked the banana bread with brownbutter jam the most followed by beet flavored gummy bear.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-04-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Thoroughly imbibed, we received our first course, the bottoms-up Whipped Scrambled Eggs served cocktail-style with Bacon, Maple Syrup, and Hot Sauce like a hangover breakfast (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUfF4p).

Three years later, it was my birthday, and I returned to find a Michelin-starred restaurant set up like the dinner party I always wanted to host only I didn't know anybody except Jamie W., of course. I have to admit I still giggle at the name and feel a need to explain that it's not a bear-trapping event on the Russian River but a real restaurant with silverware and synchronized servers. There are two seatings at their two long communal tables each evening, 6PM and 8:30PM, and oh yes, you pay in advance, $160 per person plus a 20% service charge.\n\nReservations need to be made in advance, a month in my case, in order to secure spaces, and for heaven's sake, don't be late because the purveyors warn you that if you arrive a half-hour late, you will have missed four courses. Period. Full stop. the door opens at 5:15PM, so I made sure I left work early and also pushed Jamie to skedaddle from his office. We ended up being the first ones there, and we were swept upstairs to the loft on a semi-private couch right below a twenty-year-old photo of Tom Selleck. We were immediately served a couple of Plum-Infused Pomegranate Punches in cut-glass cups like we were at a junior prom circa 1956 (photo: http://bit.ly/2dagfIJ).\n\nI was surprised we didn't get white gloves to pick them up properly. In need of something stiffer, I ordered the smoky and luscious $15 Basil Martini with Basil-Infused Mezcal, Dry Gin, Apple Mint Vermouth, and droplets of Basil Oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2dagEuN). Jamie curbed his enthusiasm by having a $3 bottle of Mexican cola called Jarritos. Thoroughly imbibed, we received our first course, the bottoms-up Whipped Scrambled Eggs served cocktail-style with Bacon, Maple Syrup, and Hot Sauce like a hangover breakfast (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUfF4p). Yummy. Next came a Brown Rice Chip with Channel Islands Halibut, Jimmy Nardello Pepper, and Sudachi decoratively placed on it (photo: http://bit.ly/2daf0ZP).\n\nThis was another lovely bite followed by a Broiled Shigoku Oyster with Nasturtium Gla\u00e7age and Lardo which I slurped with gusto (photo: http://bit.ly/2dHvaJn). The tempura-like Crispy Pole Beans arrived right after with a Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Allum Dip (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUftCd). This was capped off by a fizzy, fermented Cape Gooseberry Soda replete with a candy-stripe straw (photo:  http://bit.ly/2dlSFpP). This flurry of upstairs activity finally segued to the downstairs where chef David Barzelay explained the concept behind Lazy Bear and had the sous chefs explain each of the courses we were about to dive into (photo: http://bit.ly/2dBCnep).\n\nThe first was simply a fabulous Dinner Roll made of Spelt & Rye with a huge slab of fresh butter (photo: http://bit.ly/2dzp1QW). It so reminded me of the ones I got from Mrs Crabtree in her hairnet at the school cafeteria. This was followed by a regally meltable Beef Tartare with Tomatoes and Seaweed as garnish (photo: http://bit.ly/2dCZd5R). The soup course came next with a creamy Cucumber Vichysoisse with Stugeon, Leek, Potato and bursts of delight from the Caviar (photo: http://bit.ly/2dzqhUd). We started moving into the proteins with the seafaring tastiness of the Monterey Abalone accompanied by Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage and Mint in a faux-abalone shell (photo: http://bit.ly/2cYuu4U).\n\nThe Aged Squab was as rich as duck as it sat amid Huckleberries, Chanterelle and Sumac (photo: http://bit.ly/2dyPsZp). The high point came unsurprisingly in the rich and tender Wagyu Ribeye straight from Japan with Sunflower, Sunchoke, and Brassicas (photo: http://bit.ly/2dFJkuw). A palate cleanser came with the Cucumber Granita with a tiny cheesecake hidden underneath flavored with Lemon Verbena and Oats (photo: http://bit.ly/2d0dZAA). If there was a near-miss at all, it was the oddly retro Concord Grape Jelly with Madrone Bark and Grape Nuts (yes, the cereal...photo: http://bit.ly/2ecdcS1.\n\nFortunately a trio of treats came to the rescue: Strawberry P\u00e2te de Fruit with Jalape\u00f1o & Lime, Beehive Pavlova with Honey & Cardamom, and a S'More with Bay Leaf Meringue (photo: http://bit.ly/2dTHTHw). Oh and did I mention the $15 Peach Pit 94110 with Reisling, Bourbon, Fino Sherry, and Campari (photo: http://bit.ly/2dRG5zo) as well as the $6 Lazy Bear Cold Brew (photo: http://bit.ly/2e1vhDd)?

You start off the evening mingling with other guests over snacks in the second floor. Once dinner is ready, everybody descends to the dining hall, where they are seated across 2 long communal tables that fit around 20 each. For my fellow Potterheads out there, think the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Throughout the meal, folks are encouraged to get up, roam around the restaurant, take pictures of the open kitchen, jot down remarks on their notebooks, engage in conversation with their neighbors, and ask the staff any questions they might have. It's a 2-hour ordeal that I guarantee you won't get anywhere else.\n\nMy favorite dishes of the night were the whipped scrambled eggs, dinner roll, red kuri squash, and black twig apple. Surprisingly, the one dish that I thought needed improvement was the wagyu ribeye. Its marbling was unevenly distributed, which caused some bites to taste fattier than others. The beef also lacked the succulent flavor and buttery tenderness that I was expecting.\n\nAnother qualm was that I found it difficult to savor every single bite like I'm accustomed to. In any given fine dining setting, I'm usually the person with the largest appetite but the slowest eating pace. This didn't bode well for me here, since the servers were already handing out subsequent courses as I was still nibbling away. Because of this, the experience felt a little rushed. Everybody else seemed to keep up just fine though, so again, it's probably just me.\n\nSNACKS\n// Whipped Scrambled Eggs - bacon, maple, hot sauce\n// Channel Islands Halibut - Jimmy Nardello pepper, brown rice, sudachi\n// Broiled Shigoku Oyster - redwood, nasturtium, lardo\n// Crispy Pole Beans - cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche 'n' allium dip\n// Grapefruit and Elderflower Soda - fermented, bubbles\n\n// Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll - cultured butter\n// Sturgeon & Caviar - cucumber vichysoisse, leek, potato\n// Abalone - legumes, Brussels sprout, mints\n// Matsutake Broth - apple, nettle, egg yolk fudge\n// Red Kuri Squash - quince, kale, goat's milk\n// Aged Duck - grape, chicories, black olive\n// Wagyu Ribeye - from Miyazaki Prefecture, cabbage, pink peppercorn, brassicas\n// Pomegranate Meringue - kaffir lime, hibiscus\n// Black Twig Apple - whipped yogurt, walnut sabl\u00e9, cider caramel\n\nTREATS\n// Concord Grape Jelly - peanut, cayenne\n// Beehive Pavlova - caramelized honey\n// Pumpkin Spice Latte - coffee cool whip\n\nBEVERAGES\n// Golden Feather Tea - the only tea grown in California\n\nProTip #1: The leather sofas by the wall are by far the comfiest spots to hang out on the second floor.

The set-up of the restaurant is designed to be rustic and homey, with a furnished upper area where snacks are served and you're invited to stay as long as you want after dinner. My friend and I arrived a little bit after doors opened, and when we were escorted to the upper level, the seats were mostly full. We had to share a standing table with a nice man who educated us on how expensive the drinks pairing was. It's okay to arrive after doors open; you'll still get to sample all the snacks! We did have to wait a good amount of time for the waiters to actually start serving us snacks, and we waited even longer to get a drink. Communication could've been better because people started heading downstairs of their own volition, and we didn't know if we were supposed to follow or wait for someone to seat us. \n\nSNACKS. Oh, how I'd love to relive those whipped scrambled eggs and shigoku oysters. The eggs were so light and refreshing, with the slight flare provided by the hot sauce. The oysters tasted like the seat. The crispy pole beans were basically tempura-fried beans with fancy sour cream, but they were delicious. Goat cheese tart was well-paired with the fig. Caviar... I honestly don't remember this dish. My taste buds were probably recovering from their fervor. \n\nI love the set-up and the ability to watch the chefs plate the food. The dexterous way they place things really shows you the effort and thought that goes into the dishes. It's almost emotionally painful to eat them because art shouldn't be consumed, only appreciated. We went up a couple times to watch the chefs work and asked them questions. They didn't really give us actual answers (in answer to where the flowers for the dishes came from, one of the chefs said they drove to Golden Gate Park and picked them), but what do I know? \n\nI noted my experience with each dish because they provide a little booklet with all the courses, so I got to feel like a pretentious food critic: \n\nSpelt & Rye Dinner Roll - Could taste the slight sourness in the butter, and it folded perfectly under my knife. When I touched the bread, my fingers just sunk in like it was a beautiful golden cloud. \n\nBeef Tartare with Tomato and Seaweed - Someone apparently hand dove for that seaweed. The tomatoes were unbelievably sweet - why don't they sell this stuff at Safeway? The meat packs a punch with every bite, and the squid ink crisps were a kind of dark saltiness that brought the whole dish together. \n\nAbalone with Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage, Mints - The sauce was Cheetos-flavored. The chef said so himself. I love Cheetos, so I can't complain when it's suddenly okay to eat Cheetos in fine dining. There were brief bursts of flavor from the herbs, which were apparently harvested by some hippie man. They punctuated the chewiness of the abalone. \n\nSummer Squash (cold soup with mussels, beans, nasturtium) - Cold soup done right. The sharp bite of mint and coolness of the squash made me feel like I was inhaling a garden. The mussel is the very special center of the dish, and it's packed with flavor from all the sauces that it got dunked in before being placed into the plate. \n\nFresh Corn Grits - This one wasn't too impressive. I couldn't taste the truffles, and the corn was almost overwhelmingly sweet. \n\nAged Squab with Blueberry, Chanterelle, Sumac - Super rustic. It brings out memories of forests and food cooked in the midst of fires. There's a smokiness contained within the meat. Also, there was an edible twig. Where else can you eat branches and have it be called fine dining? \n\nGrilled Lamb - This one was pretty basic, but still delicious. A lamb chop covered in aromatic pine leaves that was so tender. This one broke the pattern because the pine leaves were unfortunately not edible. \n\nHuckleberry - The transition between main courses and dessert, this one was mostly muted flavors punctuated by the taste of huckleberry. \n\nWhite Chocolate with Laurel, Fennel, Honey, Chamomile - This went really well with the white tea I ordered, and it just brimmed with wildflowers. A little too sweet for me, but I loved the floral-scented cream inside and the drizzle of honey. \n\nTreats: Honey beehive... I'll eat honey up no matter what. This one had that great texture where it's crispy and gives beneath your teeth, but then it clumps up and you can suck on it for a bit to get all the flavor. \n\nOverall, I love the humor of this place and the appreciation for nature that comes through in all its dishes. I wish I didn't feel that treatment of us wasn't the same because we didn't fit into the same class as the other diners. Side note: if you order tea/coffee/any drink they offer at the end of dinner, you will be charged. Enjoy your time at this place and take it slow! The people next to me were just charging through their courses, and that's no way to enjoy a $200 meal.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Whipped Scrambled Eggs (snack) - with bacon, maple, hot sauce served in a tall shot glass.

I'll go on to review my favs / highlights of the tasting menu.\n\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs (snack) - with bacon, maple, hot sauce served in a tall shot glass. I loved this because it was packed with umph and flavor. Absolutely delightful.\n\nFried Soft Shell Crab (snack) - with green tomato, ramps, and cilantro. Who doesn't like soft shell crab?! One soft shell crab per 2 people and the serving was generous! Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, can't really screw up on this dish!\n\nDungeness Crab (1st course) - with charred cucumber, sugar snap pea, avocado, and mint. Color and presentation was absolutely beautiful with the bright green colors. Delicious flavors that opened up my taste buds.\n\nHalibut (2nd course) - with crawfish, summer squash, and nasturtium - the halibut is poached sous vide style so it retained a lot of moisture yet flaky and smooth to the tongue. My favorite was the reddish orange crawfish sauce made from the juices of crawfish heads, the flavors were very concentrated. \n\nPorcini (3rd course) - with fudgy yolk, blackberry, and grains - I am a big fan of runny yolk and this yolk, I don't know how they did it, was poached to perfection.\n\nCold Brew Coffee with brown sugar whip - OMG. Just get it. If you're a coffee lover, you will love this one.\n\nI realized I liked most of the seafood because they were all made very well with complex flavors and textures. I wasn't too impressed on the Guinea Hen, Bintje Potato Fondue, Grilled Lamb or any of the desserts. My fianc\u00e9 had the drink pairing and the drinks kept coming for him. I suggest ordering your drinks at the lounge upstairs because if you want to order drinks down at the communal table, its a little harder to flag somebody down. The portions are plentiful, you will leave full.\n\nWe came with another couple for a double date and we also got to meet and  mingle with the guests next to us and it was quite fun getting to know everyone.

In fact, you actually have to pre-purchase a ticket to dine here.  Being Valentines weekend, the cost of admission came out to nearly $300 per person, and that's without the over the top beverage pairings!  While some may find it frou frou, it's actually a very clever way to allow diners to focus on each bite of their tasty (and very pricy) adventure, all while maximizing revenue by pre-selling out the evening and minimizing spoilage.  Mmm...Uber-y.\n\nWhen my girlfriend and I arrived, we were given a lay of the land before being escorted upstairs to the mezzanine for cocktails and snacks.  The decor makes the space feel like the most incredible log cabin in the woods and is perfectly sized to feel intimate but not cramped when full of dinner guests.  The amazing view over the dining room is a tease, contributing to the build-up of anticipating that I've been feeling for weeks.\n\nI'm not sure what is normally served, but we started off with a nice dry champagne and special spiked punch blend (which was incredibly complex and refreshing).  To accompany the beverages, Lazy Bear likes to get things started with some amazing appetizers (or snacks as they call them).  Ours mezzanine snacks included:\n\n1) Whipped scrambled eggs - Breakfast in a shot, consisting of a whipped egg foam with bacon fat and an amazing hot sauce that I wish they would bottle.\n\n2) Shigoku oyster - Fresh oyster shooter served with an oyster broth and frozen kiwi sauce.  It had incredibly clean flavors, though the kiwi seeds could be a little overpowering to the delicate flavor of the sweet oyster.\n\n3) Beef tartare - Served on a brown rice cracker with shaved foie gras - incredibly delicate flavors and textures that melt in your mouth.\n\n4) T\u00eate de moine - Celery root mousse with Swiss raw cow's milk cheese, compressed dehydrated Asian pear, and pine tips.  Amazing texture and flavor from the perfect little bite.\n\nI ordered the \"exquisite\" Ruhstaller to cleanse the palette before we were led down to the dining room and our assigned seats.  Waiting for us was a Lazy Bear field guide (a menu booklet for note-taking) and our final snack:\n\n5) Caviar - An homage to San Francisco featuring a sourdough cracker, caviar, and a pur\u00e9e.  Again, amazing sourdough flavors and textures.\n\nChef David Barzelay opened dinner with the protocol for the evening and told the story of their absolutely incredible, mouth-watering spelt & rye dinner roll served with their signature cultured butter.\n\n6) Going on 3 years old, their butter culture produces a product that reminded me of a strong cheese.  The combination was like nothing I've ever had, and I yearned (and continue to yearn) for more.\n\nIf you've never had the privilege of dining at Lazy Bear before, each dish is served with a description from the chef who concocted its creation.  Between dishes, guests are encouraged to meet their neighbors, roam throughout the dining room, visit the bar, or even stop by the kitchen to watch (or in my case to photograph) as the chefs meticulously placed each component of the dishes during plating.  As expected, each dish was incredible thoughtful, and told a story.\n\n7) Bay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk, and bergamot.  The seafood was incredible fresh and tender, with a slight sourness, and I love the bite of the geoduck.  The chef himself foraged the spinach used in the dish.\n\n8) Steelhead trout with a fried stinging nettle, hedgehog mushroom, butterball potatoes, and an amazing smoked salmon roe.  The fish was served with a butterball potato, green garlic, and stinging nettle mash that inherited a nice green color and had just a hint of the subtle garlic flavors.\n\n9) Poussin with lettuce and spring onion.  It's a 21-day old chicken breast that is sous vide to maintain it's incredibly tender texture with subtle, clean flavors.  The chicken was raised on a diet of lacto-fermented grains which was apparent in the meat.\n\n10) Poussin Bouillon - The egg yolk fudge is served with fermented grains and spring onion, and includes a stock made from the chicken itself as a table-side pour over.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the evening because of its richness and the level of technique involved.  It also felt familiar, like a dish I grew up with...

I could likely enjoy root canal if the dentist was as into his craft as each of the chefs at Lazy Bear was. So, I know I am biased there. But, when you actually want to lick the plate clean on just the bread course, what can be bad?\n\nOn both trips, the desserts really stood out, and not just because of the pastry chef's hilarious personality. I'm not a \"sicky sweet\" woman, so things like an olive oil creamsicle, hit just the right notes for me. Desserts can be fairly one-dimensional elsewhere, but like all the courses at Lazy Bear -- each bite has a multitude of  layers and flavors.\n\nOddly, I'd return again. Why, \"oddly\"? Because I think part of the fun is the \"surprise\" of it all. Yet, I enjoyed the 2nd time as much -- if not more -- and for different reasons, than the 1st visit.

After starting you off on hor d'oeuvres and cocktails upstairs, they sit you down on communal tables (be prepared to socialize with strangers) with an open kitchen.  The staff are quick, accommodating, and more importantly, engaging.  In fact, there is no boundary between the dining room and the kitchen and they encourage people to chat with the chefs as they are plating and ask questions.  One of my friends asked jokingly if he could taste one of the desserts again and they actually whipped up a second serving of that course just for him!  The waitstaff always make sure your water / wine glass/ cocktail glass is full and that the customer is satisfied.  \n\nThe chefs explain the dishes as they are served to the diners and make suggestions on how to eat them when necessary.  They even include a booklet of the menu to allow the diners to take notes on the food as you go along (I won't lie; I ended up getting so excited that my booklet is now heavily annotated).  \nYou can tell that the chefs have put a lot of thought into each dish- from the different textures to add mouth-feel to a dish to adding sour green apples to counter creamy cheese, every dish was well composed and executed.\n\nThey change the menu daily, but the menu we got was the following:\n// (Snack) Whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, and hot sauce -- Sturgeon toast with caviar and cauliflower on pumpernickel -- Shigoku oyster with winter citrus creme and chili -- Crispy maitake mushroom with creme fraiche 'n' allium dip (their take on Sour Creme and Onion)\n// Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll- they have special cultured butter that tastes more like cheese from age; I ate most of it even though I hate butter.  You can ask for more rolls.\n// Steelhead Trout, roe, hedgehog mushrooms, barley and chicken skin, and greens\n// Scallop with kohlrabi, niitaka pear, walnut\n// Celtuce, almond, nettle, duck confit\n// Sunchoke fondue with Lisa's Cheese, black trumpet mushrooms and green apple\n// 8-10 Day Dry Aged Duck with yams, maple, gremolada, and black kale\n// Wagyu Ribeye with spring onion and brussel sprouts\n// Olive Oil Creamsicle, oro blanco, and preserved citrus\n// Parsnip cream, coffee sable, pate a choux\n// (Treats) White chocolate candy cap bar with salted caramel -- Blood Orange + Ginger Pate de Fruit -- Pumpkin Seed, Almond, and Raisin Nougat\n\nSome tips:\n1) Make sure you note any allergies ahead of time- I had forgotten to ask my guests on allergies and so we showed up and one guest is allergic to seafood (which was 1/3 of the dishes).  Luckily and thankfully, the chefs were able to whip up alternatives but I'd hate to see someone be unlucky\n2) Come with people who are adventurous with food- the whole point is that you try new things and learn to appreciate it; the chef won't made modifications just because you don't like an ingredient (unless it's because of an allergy)\n3) Come when you are in a sociable mood- with the cocktails/ hor d'oeuvres period and communal tables, Lazy Bear recommends that you mingle with the other parties (and even include a section in the booklet to write down contact information for new friends) \n\nIf you are looking for a dinner experience that you've never EVER had in your life, Lazy Bear should be included at top of your wishlist.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-01-12"}, {"excerpts": ["Whipped scrambled eggs - served in a shotglass and more like a foam ", "but, the bacon notes were a nice surprise.

I loved being greeted and whisked upstairs to the mezzanine where to my surprise, we would be starting the meal with their \"snacks\". It's a comfy area and fun to wait in anticipation of what's coming next. The earlier seating is just finishing up so, upon entering and seeing the communal tables full of smiles and satisfied diners makes you want to start eating ASAP. \n\nAlongside a pretty solid cocktail program/list we were treated to the following \"snacks\": (I'll highlight a few): Whipped scrambled eggs - served in a shotglass and more like a foam but, the bacon notes were a nice surprise. Caviar with smoked leek custard and seaweed - I mean, it's caviar. Crispy pole beans - had a really nice creme fraiche dip that reminded me of really fancy ranch (which I normally hate with a passion). \n\nOk, onto the second part of the meal... but first, I'll paint the picture of this part of the dining experience. There are 40 seats downstairs and two very long communal tables. It's set \"in the kitchen\" and you're encouraged to hop out of your seat, ask questions and see what's going on with the kitchen staff. Pretty cool if you ask me. \n\n1st Course: Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll with Cultured Butter - that butter was bomb, so lather it on like crazy. Don't be shy. \n2nd Course: Beef Tartare with Tomato and Seaweeds - well executed but, fell a little flat for me.\n3rd Course: Monterey Abalone with Arrowhead Cabbage, Legumes, and Mint - probably my favorite dish of the evening. Done with a light hand and fantastically flavored. \n4th Course: Summer Squash with Shelling Beans, Mussels and Edible Flowers - a wonderful dish for the end of the summer season.\n5th Course: Aged Squab with Huckleberry, Chanterelle Mushrooms and Sumac - Beautiful presentation and the mushrooms...unreal. \n6th Course: Grilled Lamb with Strawberry and Pine Nut - Easily the best piece of lamb I've had in my life. Seriously. \n7th Course: Cucumber with Lemon Verbena and Oats - sweet and fresh.\n8th Course: Concord Grape Dessert with Grape Nuts and Chocolate Shavings - brought me back to my childhood with the grapenut thing. \n\nSide note: I brought 4 bottles of wine with me (there were four of us) to cover all spectrums of the meal. Corkage was a bit pricey but, it was worth having an arsenal of vino by my side. \n\nAll in all, it's a dining experience that shouldn't be taken lightly. Worth the price tag? Maybe not so much but, definitely worth the one star it's received from Michelin.

When they warn you not to arrive late, don't, because you will miss out on 4-5 cute appetizers + champagne served in their upstairs mezzanine.

As for drinks, I had a Michael Corleone cocktail (like an old fashioned) that was just fabulous. We ordered a couple wines by the glass and they were okay. A few of our dining neighbors ordered the wine pairing, and seemed to like it enough (note that we apparently ate on a night with a lot of seafood, so most of the pairings were white wine).\n\nAmbiance - 4.5 stars. Warm and quirky. I loved the old timey California decor, the cool twiggy ceiling sculpture and the bathroom artwork. Being able to watch the diners from the first seating from the lounge area was pretty cool too.\n\nService - 5 stars. Really excellent and friendly service. Every single one of the servers was wonderful and I can see that they are what elevates this to a 2 star Michelin experience.\n\nPretentiousness - 12 stars. So, I get it, the food is really complicated to make and everything, but every dish's process and ingredients had to be described down to the smallest detail. Like, I don't think I'm exaggerating to say that an aggregate of 30 minutes of this meal was spent listening to them describe the dishes. After multiple courses of this, I started tuning them out (sorry!). The wines on the wine list were repeatedly described as \"esoteric\" and honestly I think quality of the wines we had was below what I would have expected for that price. Also, the faux-cocktail party during the appetizer course at the start was just bizarre. We were seated back to back on an ottoman with another couple, so it was rather uncomfortable to sit for such a long period of time (45 minutes). I also didn't see anyone actually interact with anyone not in their own group during this time, so it felt like we were acting out roles in a play. Memorable, but not really in a good way (and not something I would choose to pay for again). The communal dining part was fine, as our dining neighbors were all very nice and friendly, but I am an introvert and it was actually tiring for me to sit so long with strangers. \n\nBottom line, for the price, I don't think the food or experience lived up to the hype for me.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-09-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Whipped Scrambled Eggs with Bacon, Maple, Hotsauce:  ", "A\nServed frothy in a shot glass.

I just loved everything about it from the delightful and well thought out menu to the service, to the company, and to the overall vibe.

Fortunately, my friend scored tickets just as they were released and I was invited to join in on the fun along with Nina Y.. I think the ~$130/pp we paid seems a bit high but think of it as a dinner party experience and delicious food. We went on a Tuesday night for the first seating. We all work in the city and barted to that direction so it was pretty easy. Might be a challenge looking for parking though. \n\nPRELUDE: Front\n\nCheck in at the door. Give your name. Someone will escort you upstairs (and note: they won't forget your name)\n\nSCENE I: The upstairs gathering\n\nI recommend getting to the event early especially if you're the first seating. You definitely want to get some of the limited seating/table area upstairs if you want to be able to set plates/drinks down or, if you're a yelper like me, to get good lighting to take pictures as it is very dim. We were served five amuse bouches (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). They were little interesting bites. I actually liked the whipped scrambled eggs a lot in their simplicity of ingredients but complexity of texture! Also, as I was allergic to cucumber (p.s. they are great about food allergies) they allowed me to substitute the punch of a glass of champagne.\n\nSCENE II: Downstairs\n\nCan my dining room look like this? It's very modern decor (Imagine somewhere Eames chairs would fit but with more warmth and character). Everyone had assigned seating which you don't have to find yourself (they bring you there). Our fellow diners were cheerful and we exchanged hellos (but no obligation here to make new friends). They provide you with a small notebook and pencil allowing you to jot down notes about your dishes as the chef describes it or as you eat it. Also between courses you are encouraged to get up, walk around, observe the chefs cooking/plating (from a distance), and even ask them questions! It's an open kitchen.\n\nList of Dishes (I'll just say everything is amazing and highlight any fun facts):  Valentine's bread, \nSweet Pea Custard (This had salmon roe, I mentally told myself it wouldn't work, but it did. This was a mouthful of Spring), Charred Onion Broth (Egg yolk and pork fat. The depth of flavor was soul warming). Halibut (One of the chefs gave us their brining ratio and preparation method with sous vide). Rabbit (Served with snails that they raised and had been fed only with basil -- how long does that even take? I swear I tasted the basil). Lamb (on the bone with the right amount of fat). Rhubarb (an icy sorbet). Oats financier (yum. It was served with granola that reminded me of campfires and coffee).  Final Treats (5 different classic pastry chef deserts like a macaron and cream puff). \n\nFINI\n\nFood: There's a story behind every dish. David Barzelay (Owner/Head Chef) is fun and not too polished. He also allows every one of his chefs to express their creativity and lead on a course (including providing a brief intro the dish). \n\nService: Very professional. Each one of their seatings is a carefully choreographed party. The servers were very attentive. The chefs and kitchen staff were fun and friendly. We even took a picture at the end (unknowingly with all the folks having a blast behind us -- I guess we were the serious ones?) \n\nOverall: If you can go, do it. I'm not sure if its worth the premium to have it on a weekend night (what are you doing for 2-3 hours on a weekday night anyway?) as they serve the same food throughout.

They start you off with cocktails and hors d'oeuvre upstairs in the loft. Predinner: Whipped scrambled eggs, channel islands halibut, broiled shigoku oyster, spicy pole beans, and cape gooseberry soda. \n\nDinner: When we sat down, they brought out some spelt & rye dinner roll with their in house cultured butter. The butter was smooth, soft, and decadently rich. The hard part was finding the balance to have enough butter for the pieces of bread. \n\nWine: The wine ordered was not too big and a bit light in taste. By itself, I wouldn't have liked it but for this meal, it did well as a background player. Coming in when needed but confident and dependable to downplay it's role so the food can shine. \nThe beef tartare with tomato was good and finely displayed. Next was the sturgeon & caviar. Apparently this was topped with a ton of caviar. I have plans to buy a jar and sit in pjs on my birthday with a glass of champagne and watch tv. Last was the monterey abalone. It was lightly salted and the meat was cut up into manageable small bites allowing all the other greens to mix in with the fine meat.\n\nThe aged squab with huckleberry, chanterelle, and sumac was perfectly done. The meat was tender but didn't tear apart during the cut. Mushrooms and berries brought an earthy tartness to the taste- and to bring forth more of that dark forest feel, there was a 'twig' that was prepared and lightly coated with dark chocolate powder reminding me more of earth and dirt. But yummy. \n\nNow the star of the show: the Wagyu Ribeye. How have I lived thus far without consuming more of this divine goodness? The experience was otherworldly. Before even cutting into the perfectly marbled meat, I hear soft gasping exclamations of, \"oh my God!\" down the long table. The Wagyu was from Miyazaki Prefecture, prepared with sunflower, sunchoke, and bradsicas on the side. Of course. I imagine this cow's life full of sunshine and happiness. Living in spoiled relaxations- days full of massages and beer with flowers behind it's ears. I've never seen such beautiful and even marblelizations. From the outside crust to the pink marbled meat, this plate deserves to be loved. This was worth it and this was happiness. I was sad when it was over. More please. \n\nTo clean our palette after that decadent love affair with the Wagyu, we begrudgingly enjoyed a cucumber salad of sort. It was fresh and unassuming- like a reminder for us to slowly get back to earth and continue on. Then first desserts came out w concord grape and buttered icecream. They do amazing things with butter here, folks. Don't be lactose intolerant.\n\nSecond dessert came with treats. Strawberry pate de fruit. Yums pate. Beehive pavlova and s'more. It was a perfect ending to our meal. The little checkered notepad contains everything we've eaten and the pencils provided were for taking notes. Thank you to my two loves for experiencing this with me. You are always great wonderful company and now synonymous with 'good eats'. \n\nWould I come here again? Yes.

In buying the tickets for a 2 person seating a month ahead, I was a little pensive about what to expect.  The tickets aren't cheap, and there's no option to peruse any menu before then, so it requires a lot of upfront commitments. Scary, I know.\n\nAs everyone's already raved about, the appetizers that are served up in the mezzanine area before dinner are on point.  The whipped scrambled eggs are the popular item, but there were some seriously amazing drinkable starters like the cucumber soda.

I took a few notes on each of the dishes the entire evening, and it's been incredibly helpful in reliving the entire evening.  Dishes were provided at a reasonable pace, and what I found a little interesting was how quickly your plates were cleared once you were done eating.  My husband and I got into talking to the couple next to us, and what I find to be absolutely incredible is how Lazy Bear seems to facilitate the coming together of other \"foodies.\" Some of the dishes that really stood out to us were the amazing and high quality cuts of protein we received, and the flavor profiles of both the sweet and savory dishes.  My favorite thing I ate that night was a Tomato Panzanella that had a thinly sliced piece of wagyu on top.  My husband's favorite was the pork shoulder that came garnished with stone fruit and almonds.

It doesn't feel like dining at a stuffy restaurant -- it feels like coming to your friend's house for a really large dinner.

Not only do I enjoy dinner parties, but it's my preferable way to entertain guests in my home.\n\nWhen I booked the reservation, which was easy to do after I read the page of instructions, I paid $156.60/person with my credit card. At the time of dining, you can decide if you want to add the wine pairing or mixed pairing for $65/person. If you do decide to add the pairing, a 20% tip is added and the total comes out to $84.83 with tax. Now that the shocking finances are out of the way, I can move on to the fun stuff.\n\nAs all the reviews mentioned, you start out upstairs with complimentary low alcohol punch, which tastes herbal and medicinal. Spacing upstairs is limited so the early bird gets the worm (or chair as in this case). Because the atmosphere is supposed to be dinner-party-like, my dining companion and I began talking to the people around us. However, people are shy and we had to dig for common ground. Eventually, we found another couple celebrating a birthday and found commonality with them while being served whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, hot sauce, shigoku oyster with citrus kosho froth (my photo came out grainy due to the low lighting), a platter of duck liver mousse with marmalade, duck confit hushpuppy, with black lime, duck rillette which is the quince fruit roll-up, and duck Slim Jim with sour cream and herbs. The last of the appetizers was a bowl of bone marrow and cheddar fondue (more like a broth) served with crudit\u00e9s. Out of the appetizers, the scrambled eggs served in a shot glass was my favorite.\n\nWhen it was time to move downstairs, the host seats you in pre-assigned seating. Hoping we would get to sit with the couple we had met upstairs, I was sorely disappointed when we were seated next to a  couple who didn't want to interact with us at all. Luckily, the restaurant welcomes you to move around, so the guests are encouraged to get out of their seats to observe the kitchen, talk with the chefs and staff, take pictures, write notes in the provided booklet so we weren't stuck with the unsociable couple who only wanted to talk between themselves and their phone. Uggh!\n\nCultured butter which tastes like cheese accompanied the brown butter brioche which was served first. Afterwards, the sorrel salad containing garden herbs, spot prawn, geoduck clam, barley, and miner's lettuce arrived and was challenging to eat because it contained 3 snails which our chef announced were fed only basil and then braised for a couple of hours. See photo. Although I've had snails many times before (here and in France), I must be out of practice because they kind of freaked me out seeing them in my salad. Seeing the miner's lettuce reminded me of hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains with my daughter's pre-school class whose teacher would pick up various items along the trail for the class to touch or eat....like miner's lettuce. When the charred onion broth was served with Tennessee Ham, an egg yolk, pea-sized apple balls, and scallion, the chef's description of the egg yolk was fascinating. A raw egg yolk is set in 67\u00b0F oil overnight to \"cure\" it. After hot broth is poured over the yolk, you can cut it in half and it still keeps its shape and has lots of flavor. \n\nAfter the starters the saffron lobster was served with rice grits which was very much like risotto made with lobster broth. Interestingly, the chips that accompanied this dish were made from spot prawn roe that were dehydrated, mixed with rice then dehydrated again, then lightly fried. When the grilled squab arrived, I was not only excited about the squab itself, which I hadn't eaten since I was a little girl in Mexico, but it was served with foie gras which was banned (but recently lifted) in CA for several years much to my dismay. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. Mixing things up a bit, the wagyu ribeye arrived with a Thai coconut green curry sauce. Admittedly, the beef wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth as I had hoped, but still the combo was amazing. \n\nEnding the meal with a variety of sweets is my kind of meal. Creatively served with creme anglaise, cream cheese, sparkling water and fennel was an all carrot plate: pressed dried carrot, carrot granita and carrot boba. Following the vegetable dessert was the sticky toffee pudding with a brown butter sorbet, walnut brittle, and sweetened creme fraiche. Rounding out the desserts was a selection of treats: chili rose macaron topped with togarashi, negroni gelee, toasted s'more, a caramel wrapped in edible rice paper and walnut mousse cake. See photo.\n\nIf you're like me and you want to socialize in a dinner party-like atmosphere with food that is being prepared in new and creative ways, then LB is a worthy splurge.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-03-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Whipped scrambled eggs - You are eating foam that tastes like bacon and at the bottom of the glass had a spicy sauce that was very delicious.\n", "2) ", "Shigoku oyster - this was my favorite dish upstairs.

Although expensive, I definitely think this is something everybody should try at least once. ($300+)\n\nTwo of my awesome bestest foodie friends (Christine, David) who wanted to dine at this restaurant unselfishly purchased a gift certificate for me and my girlfriend. In return I promised to take many photos and write an extensive review on Yelp about my experience, so here it is! \n\nFirst things first, I wanted to note how Lazy Bear does its reservations/seatings. You will have to purchase the tickets via website a month prior to your desired date. They sell out pretty fast. Tickets range from $150-175 per person. It is a set menu and they will accommodate dietary special requests.  If you purchased/received a gift certificate you will have priority and be contacted immediately when tickets go on sale. Parking isn't too difficult to find in this area, and it is also not too far from Bart.\n\nMy dinner reservation for two was at 6PM. Upon arrival, our coats were taken and we were escorted upstairs to the mezzanine area where we sat and ordered alcoholic drinks (not included in the ticket price). You can order pretty much anything as they do have a full bar downstairs. I had requested for a more intimate area for my and my girlfriend as we were celebrating our anniversary. I was seated in sofa fit for two in the corner of the mezzanine and was very pleased they were able give us a secluded intimate area. They served us complimentary refreshments that was very refreshing and flavorful. My girlfriend said it sort of tasted like chinese herbal medicine. It was similar but this was much more refreshing and delicious. Once everybody was settled in the handful of waitresses/waiters started rolling out the appetizers/snacks.\n\n*Note: Lazy Bear serves a different set menu every day (or maybe month?). Below is what I had on 02/05/16. \n\nSNACKS/APPETIZERS (bite sized):\n1) Whipped scrambled eggs - You are eating foam that tastes like bacon and at the bottom of the glass had a spicy sauce that was very delicious.\n2) Shigoku oyster - this was my favorite dish upstairs. It was amazing! They put kiwis in the oysters that I thought really fit well with the oyster. \n3) Beef tartare -  beef on top of a cracker (made out of rice?). The beef just melted in your mouth. It was very flavorful. \n4) Tete de moine - this was a very beautiful dish and there was a flower that tasted like cheese on it. The main component of the dish was some kind of celery mousse. \n\nAfter these dishes we were brought downstairs and seated. In Front of everybody was a warm wet towel, a menu, some caviar, and bread and butter***. The head chef David, welcomed everybody and introduced the dishes in front of us prior to eating. Before each dish is served a different chef would explain each dish. \n\n***I'm going to quote the head chef on the cultured butter they've been working on for 3 years. \"The butter is pretty f***ing delicious\" and yes, the butter was f***ing delicious. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Hands down, best butter I've had. I asked if I can purchase some and she was able to accommodate my requests.\n\nEntres:\n5) Bay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk - I'm not a huge seafood fan, but these were amazing. The scallops were so fresh and tender. It might have been one of my favorite dishes.\n6) Steelhead trout - Again, fresh and tender. It was amazing. \n7) Egg yolk Fudge- Egg yolk fudge, super savory dish. The egg really was fudge like.\n8) Black truffle grits - Most comforting dish. It reminded me of mac and cheese but a lot better. Heavy amounts of black truffle on top.\n9) Squab - Not a big squab fan, but you can tell the meat was incredibly tender and had a nice smokey flavor. It tasted a bit like duck.\n10) Lamb - Very juicy and flavorful. I don't eat lamb regularly, but this was good. \n11) Coconut & Dark Chocolate desserts - The coconut had a very interesting texture. I preferred the dark chocolate. \n12) Small dessert snacks - The snacks were underwhelming. Some had interesting flavors, but the presentation was beautiful. I probably enjoyed the peanut butter & Jelly the most. \n\nLazy Bear was a great experience for me. I really wanted seconds of certain dishes. I think all of them tasted good and all of them had a great deal of thought and consideration in each dish. By presentation alone, you can really appreciate the work they put into making each dish. \nI know you are wondering, \"Will I be full? I'm paying $300+\". Yes, you do get full because they serve you so many dishes.  In addition to that I've tasted and experienced flavors I've never had before. Like I said, it is an culinary experience. There is more to it than just sitting down and eating. \n\nShoutout to the waitress who hooked me up with some of that delicious cultured butter.

Not wanting to disappoint her with the actual meaning of the restaurant's name (an anagram of the owner/chef's last name Barzelay), I took her along so I could actually enjoy eating as she took notes in our field guide. I present to you a summary of her notes.\n\n---\nLazy Bear is first and foremost a communal dining *experience* that showcases modern American fine dining. Relying on the energies of a packed restaurant, tickets are limited to two seatings of 40 people. E-mails are sent when tickets are available.\n\nACT I: SNACKS\nThe presentation of amuse bouches takes place in the upper level of what looks to be a cabin made for a weekend nature retreat. Various spots of the cabin are designed depending on how communal a party feels comfortable participating. Two couches allow space for larger parties (or groups of small parties) to convene while smaller tables and a small corner couch are designed for parties that want more intimacy (and are prime spots to watch the 6pm dinner unfold if you're scheduled for 8:15).\n\n- Whipped Scrambled Eggs (Bacon, Maple, Hot Sauce): It's the best way to eat eggs and maple bacon as it combines the essences of eggs and bacon without getting full! It's better to actually mix it evenly for full effect.\n- Olio Nuovo (Milk Gelato, Grape, Almond): The olive oil is the main star of this course and the toppings complement it; milk gelato tastes buttery. The dish is served in an ornate glass bowl.\n- Duck Charcuterie: Consisting of duck confit hushpuppies, duck rillette (quince leather) and duck slim jims. The items presented were a cute way to present meat. The slim jim toppings had a cooling effect to the spicy duck. Rillette tasted like a Fruit Roll-Up. Hushpuppies were fancy duck nuggets done right.\n- Abalone Chowder (Potato, Chive): An interesting take on chowder, there is a tease of abalone and the chips have a nice salt-and-pepper crunch.\n\nThere was a house cider that was quite strong. I couldn't finish my drink for fear of not wanting to get too sick from the remaining alcohol that was to be served.\n\nINTERMEZZO: MIXED PAIRING\nWe had the mixed alcohol pairing, which consisted of two white wines, two red wines, a beer and cocktail. These can be bought at time of ticket purchase or tacked on upon arrival. Pairings worked well with their respective dishes. \n\nACT II: MAINS\nThe rest of the meal took place in 2 long communal tables seating 20 people each. Hosts will escort diners to their spots on the table to balance out the parties. Observing that the earlier seating wasn't very communal, we made an effort to make conversation with both sides to us. Having a stuffed bear as a prop certainly helped with breaking the ice.\n\n- Brown Butter Brioche (Cultured Butter): The bread was easy to pull apart with your hands. Crust was crunchy yet the bread was warm and soft. The butter culture has been in use for 2 years and has a cheesy consistency. \n- Bay Scallops (Mandarin, Yogurt, Juniper, Chicories): A \"celebration of citrus\", the small scallops soaked the mandarin oranges and yogurt. \n- Dungeness Crab (Persimmon, Brown Butter, Brussels Sprout): The stock is made from boiling the crab shells and the pincers are used for meat. Persimmon chips are slightly crunchy and tasted good with the crab brine.\n- Matsukake (Douglas Fir, Scallion, Kohlrabi): The mushrooms are only in season in the early winter. They are also grown under pine trees, which gives it a distinct smell. No1DP notes that the bowl and soup broth are made to be enjoyed as a miso and the aroma is more noted if you sip your bowl instead of spooning your soup.\n- Squab (Pomegranate, Salsify, Hazelnut): Squab is domesticated pigeon but the taste and texture was similar to ribeye. The breast meat was used. The salsify and chips absorbed some of the fat. \n- Beef Short Rib (Rice Grits, Carrot, Black Trumpet Mushrooms): The meat was braised to perfection. Rice grits were creamy but not rich. Glaze consisted of carrot juice.\n- Kiwi (Chartreuse, Kaffir Lime, Buttermilk): Lighter of the two main dessert courses used as the palate cleanser. The combination of ingredients are meant to be blended together as a slush.\n- Parsnip (Coffee, Cocoa, Egg Yolk): The heavier of the two desserts and made to be blended together. It's a more unusual way to eat parsnips but the blended mixture was more enjoyed than the individual components. Contrast the parsnip with the toffee made with combination of dark and milk chocolate.\n- Mignardises: Standout was the green tea cake and frozen smores. \n\nIf additional items were ordered the bill for remaining items were tucked into nature-themed paperbacks.\n---\n\nThe Lazy Bear dinner party was a success!

I thought it was a piece of chicken but was surprised that it was fried bread with pickled watermelon on top - which helped with the spiciness.\n- Concord Grape Soda: We got this cute grape soda in a tiny chemistry-theme glassware with a tiny water straw when we got seated. Had a hint of gingery taste to it, so I didn't like that, but it wasn't overbearing so not bad.\n\nGot escorted to our assigned seating & waiting was a cute field guide notebook with a pencil!

The aesthetics were amazing & so particular. I also did think it was fancy for them to fold up my napkin & tidy up my seat everytime I walked away - talk about amazing service! Main courses:\n- Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll: From the butter to the bread, they made this themselves. Warm & toasty. A bit on the saltier side but I still gobbled it up because it was yummy.\n- Tomato Panzanella: One of the dishes that stood out to me most with a thin carpaccio of Miyazaki Ribeye above a layer of avocado, padron conserva & seaweed focaccia. Cutting each bit with all items in one spoonful had so much texture & taste, that I wanted MORE! \n- Legumes: Summer squash, bell, pepper, fennel, and saffron nage all in one with a buttery foamy sauce around it just made everything mesh so well together. Each legume was sweet on its own & mixed with the buttery sauce just topped it off for me :)\n- Celtuce Stem & Leaves: common Chinese veggie, but the way they made this was different from how I'd eat at home. The took the inside of the celtuce & kept it crunchy without overcooking & topped it with almond and chicken skin bits for extra flavor - I would have been happy with the celtuce stem itself, but the bits they added on top put it on another level!\n- Fresh Corn Grits: OMG CORN! They cooked the flavor of the corn just perfectly because all of the corn taste was just perfectly there! I am a huge fan of corn and I gobbled this up wanting and craving more! They had a bit of what looked like proscuitto on top which tasted good with the corn, but on its own it was salty. Man do I miss this delightful taste!\n- Grilled Berkshire Pork Shoulder: The fatty part of this pork was sweet & yummy. Different that it was cooked with grilled peach, turnip, succulents, & stonefruit tare - but they went  surprisingly good with the savory taste of the juicy pork.\n- Mizyaki Ribeye Cap: Mmm.. how i love wagyu! This was probably why our meal costed so much but I loved every bit of this fatty meat! It was cooked at perfect melt-in-my-mouth-ness and paired with tomatoes, black garlic, and eggplant - boy would I want some more of this right now! \n- White Sesame: This was probably my least favorite of the night, IF i had to choose one. Subtle & not too sweet of a sesame pudding with bits of green melon & sake.\n- Blue Corn: One of my top! Who would of thought kettle corn and, blueberry ice cream & cake would go so well together!

I was hooked immediately but was thwarted a few times the past year when trying to get a seat through their lottery system. My most recent failed attempt was for their last dinner in June before they moved operations to their brand new brick and mortar space - the endgame of all pop-ups.\n\nImagine my delight when Anna came through clutch again with a surprise reservation for October 5 at their two-story space with two long communal tables seating a total of 40 guests per service. She was able to pounce on two tickets on their new system that licensed the software of Alinea's system where diners prepay for tickets in full. which cuts down on cancellations. Despite the whole system crashing due to demand and technical glitches, the first two weeks of dinners were sold out within hours. \n\nOur UberX pulled away in a cloud of mist as raindrops lazily pelted us from above. Our eyes nervously darted from door to door for a semblance of signage when the hostess appeared in a doorway and smiled. Our eyes adjusted to the darkness as we stepped into a beautifully decorated dining space with ultra-high ceilings, huge open kitchen with gleaming steel, and gorgeous wood on wood action from the tables to the floor. The space was so new that blank canvases hung on the walls of the dining room as placeholders for some forthcoming art. We were led upstairs to the lounge to relax until the rest of the diners arrived.\n\nThe lounge had an unobstructed vantage point of the dining space and the kitchen below where Chef Barzelay and his staff were calmly prepping and assembling the firs round of amuse bouches.\n\nThe lounge itself made me feel like I was in a pimped out ski chalet with mid-century finishes. Hexagonal coffee tables. Fireplace from the Jetsons' living room. Plush bearskin rugs. And a picture of Tom Selleck with his trademark mustache that just oozed masculinity.\n\nThe comfortable vibe continued when we were offered glasses of complimentary punch: roasted pineapple juice with rye whiskey and basil - refreshing and quite potent.\n\nAt this point, groups of diners started arriving upstairs in waves and began mingling with strangers, which echoed Lazy Bear's motto: \"We think that the best dining experiences are the ones where we're seated around a table sharing food and stories with others.\"\n\nThe first amuse bouche or \"snack\" as they refer to it, was a shooter of whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, and a dot of hot sauce. The sous vide eggs in cream went down smooth and the sweet maple syrup and hot sauce added great contrast. Could have had 4 more of these.\n\nNext up was a cute Damson plum that has been bruleed with chicken liver mousse, brioche cracker, caramelized onion puree with sorrel leaf. Great balance of the savory chicken liver (my favorite kind of liver) with the sweet, juicy plum (my new favorite fruit).\n\nServers were smiling and holding out trays of food for people to Instagram. The excitement for the upcoming dinner was palpable as the small talk between strangers grew louder. \n\nThe most interesting snack in terms of flavor and texture were the charred tomatillos with caramelized onion creme fraiche, beef jerky, radish. I enjoyed both the crunchy radish and fleshy tomatillo as the juice dribbled down my chin. The smoky beef jerky and the subtly sweet caramelized creme fraiche could easily be slathered on anything...like a bagel for instance.\n\nAn onyx bowl of chilled sweet corn custard with American white sturgeon caviar was placed on our plaid tablecloth. I'm a fan of anything sweet corn so this went down the hatch in five seconds. My only gripe is that it was a small portion - I understand that it's an amuse bouche but it was literally one spoonful (look at the picture of the spoon for scale).\n\nAfter serving this last snack, servers began guiding everyone downstairs to take their seats. The host had a clipboard of everyone's name and seating position - curious to find out how they determined the seating. Alphabetical? When the reservation was made? or purely random?\n\nWe sat next to a couple celebrating their first anniversary as well as an old friend and investor of Lazy Bear back when it was pop-up. By trade he worked at IGN and had never invested in a restaurant before but after falling in love with the concept a few years ago, he was more than happy to support Lazy Bear as it transitioned from pop-up to brick and mortar.\n----------------\n\n(Rest of my thoughts here: http://www.scrumphsus.com/blog/2014/10/20/lazy-bear)", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-10-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The snacks included: whipped scrambled eggs shot (accompanied with bacon, maple syrup, and hot sauce).

Probably up there with French Laundry, but much more affordable. From head to toe: ambiance, service, taste, execution was done perfectly to a T. On arrival, a friendly and non-pretentious host gives you a quick tour of the communal tables and the open cooking space. When you first enter, you think that you're the first one to arrive at the home made dining party. By doing so, it removes all the crowds that line up for restaurants like these. The space by the way, is gorgeous. You are then escorted upstairs to a lofted bar area where drinks flow and you are served the 'snacks'. It's a cozy homey space that makes you feel like you're at a friend's cabin living room. The snacks included: whipped scrambled eggs shot (accompanied with bacon, maple syrup, and hot sauce). Breakfast in a shot glass. How delicious. Get it all in on one bite. Then came albacore with aji amarillo, ricecracker, foie grase, cavier in a potato wrap (to die for!), hot sweetbread with pickled water melo, concord grape soda with lemon verbena in a mini cute beaker glass. The nerd in me loved this! That was just the 'appetizer' portions. \n\nThe Main Course: \nSpelt & Rye Dinner Roll with house cultured butter: incredible butter, creamy and I just ate it off the butter knife sans the roll\nTomato panzanela with  carpaccio of miyazaki ribe eye, avocado, padron conserva, seaweed foccaccia: the marble on that beef glistened like pearls\n\nLegumes with summer squash, bell pepper, fennel and saffron sage: beautiful presentation \nEgg yolk poached with farro verde, onion, spinach: the yolk does not run regardless how you cut into it, it challenges food science\nCorned grits with lomobush: this easily the best dish. something as simple as corn. I licked the bowl clean in a savage way while nobody was looking.\nGrilled berkshire pork shoulder with peach and stone fruit: they somehow made the pork taste like almonds\nMiyazaki ribeye cap w/ tomato, black garlic, eggplant: delicious beef again that just glistened. This time it was the star of the dish rather than a compliment. Whoa that was delicious.\nWhite sesame green melon, sake lees, rose geranium: My gosh this was so refreshing and good. The dofu in this made my mouth so happy! \nVanilla ice cream with chicory, cashew and potato chip: Who would have thought? After having this has made me change the way I eat vanilla ice cream. I now sprinkle all my ice cream with a lays potato chip but its just not same. \n\nThe Treats: The meal ended with a semi-freddo with Vietnamese coffee caramelized apricot with hazelnut and milk chocolate, red velvet macaroons. \n\nThe meal was realistically a 15 meal course of small bites. We were soo stuffed at the end! The service might I add was impeccable and everything well thought out. We had a friend in our group who has a very unique allergy to citrus. They pain painstakingly prepared each dish with a citrus substitution without compromising quality or taste. I thought for them to go out of the way for one person was phenomenal! Lazy Bear, you outdone yourself. Often times, when you dine in San Francisco, it is basically a smorgasbord of delicious and mind altering food. Restaurants in San Francisco has set such a high bar for food that no matter where in the world you go to, you have developed a very discerning taste. Truly lucky to have this access a stones throw away. With that said, Lazy Bear is one of the few that not only is a trip down gastronomy but also presents it in a creative and warm way. Typically, you get the cold empty rehearsed lines but at Lazy Bear you truly feel like you're having a kick ass dinner at a friend's home. People actually warmly, passionately, and proudly describe the best they have to offer you. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back here if only I can get a reservation! Hey Lazy Bear, how about a reservation for my birthday in a couple of months!  Unfortunately, I gotta watch the clock and be at the mercy of when they send emails notifying you tickets are on sale. Word of advice to get a reservation, sign up for the emails and follow them on twitter. They will email the day of when tickets go on sale for the following month and twitter a week before tickets go out. I recommend doing both. The price ranges from $130-$170 (they will include gratuities when you purchase your tickets online). This depends on day of the week and time. There are 2 seatings at 6:30pm and 8:30pm every day.

However, when we got there, the majority of people were already there and seated at all the nice seats upstairs. Instead, we were at a high ball table towards the center. While we were sitting there, the waitress moved us a little bit to make room, but there just wasn't enough room. I definitely was a little put out by it. \n\nWe got a delicious punch when we first got up there and also got 5 different dishes up there.

The foie gras was probably my favorite overall because I just love foie. \n\nThen we moved downstairs and had: \nMadre's Reviver: OH MY GOD. So delicious of a drink. The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones. None of them were amazing like the first dessert, but they were all really good. (caramel sesame cream puff, frozen smore, sangria jelly, coconut caramel, and black forest macaron.)\n\nThe overall experience was great. The servers were so attentive and always folded the napkins when we left the table. They always served us together as well. So great!\n\nOverall, such a great experience. Definitely one of those things you could do every so often (like once a season or so). \n\nProtip: get tickets at noon when they open up.

We were standing in the middle of the room and it was helpful to have tables throughout but hard to settle in.

The bacon made it smoky, and their house hot sauce and the maple syrup at the bottom made it an awesome breakfast like dish.\n2. Kumamoto oyster: with granny smith apple froth and fennel pollen \n3.

Sea buckthorn soda: They juiced it and made a syrup from the musk, with foam on top. Unique, but I didn't love it \n\nDownstairs: seating at long tables\n1. *Toasted brassica infused broth: the broth was very light and clean, and there were pieces of cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, pickled turnips, fried kale \n2. Spelt and rye dinner roll: their version of a Parker house roll with spelt and rye for nuttiness, topped with brown butter salt. I love salt. Their house cultured butter uses buttermilk with cultures carried forward for 3 years now. It was cheesy and tangy\n3. *Bay scallop: from New England, served raw.  The shell held a satsuma and pine oil citronette that you pour over the dish. It was topped with pine tips, fresh mandarin oranges, partially dehydrated mandarin orders, succulents, buddha's hand, and a meyer lemon zest.  The pine and buttermilk panna cotta underneath was really smooth. I never thought pine could go into a dish, but this one balanced a lot of random ingredients together really well\n4. *Sunchoke: all the parts of a sunflower. There was a sunchoke puree with cheese, sunflower petals, sunflower sprouts, and sunflower seeds. the jus was made of sunchoke and chicken.  The stand out was actually the sweetbreads (sauteed in butter, garlic, lemon juice, fried). The texture and flavor were really good. The egg yolk confit was more like a fudge texture than runny. It was a very creative and interesting dish\n5. *Butterball potatoes: potatoes that were only 2 weeks old, super tender, almost like gnocchi?, super sweet and creamy. It came with green garlic, stinging nettles, chantarelles, crispy seaweed, crispy nettles. On the bottom was a German butterball potato-sea lettuce-nettle puree. I didn't know I could enjoy potatoes so much\n6. Sonoma county duck: a sausage made from the legs and wrapped in collard greens (good flavor), quince roasted in duck fat (with cinnamon, black pepper, ginger), and the duck breast. The breast is aged in house for 7 days, so it ferments and tastes almost like ham.\n7. Pork belly: from Sonoma. Brined for 24 hours, braised for 40 hours to tenderize it, and they did a good job of rendering out the fat.  It came with fresh and smoked beet juice with apple cider and a green apple + onion soubise. Various sorrels (wood, French, red vein) and mustard greens added earthiness. The smoked beets were also really good with the pork belly\n8. Hazelnut: coffee ice cream with candied meyer lemon peel (loved this lemon peel with the hazelnut and coffee). It also had a brown rice pudding cooked in toasted hazelnut milk, cocoa crisps, hazelnut coffee, and a brown butter puree. This was a pretty interesting take on hazelnut (ie not just hazelnut and chocolate)\n9. Persimmon: Hachiya semifreddo (I prefer ice cream), salt roasted fuyu (encased in salt and compressed, pretty salty), pickled persimmon puree. Then there was a malted sponge cake (subtle). The root beer pudding w/malted milk and tempered chocolate tasted like a whopper!\n\nFinal Treats: \n1. *Vietnamese coffee: frozen vietnamese coffee covered in white chocolate and on top of a chocolate cookie \n2. Chocolate bonbon: with pine and yuzu, topped with fleur de sel. I liked the yuzu and how they rounded out the meal with more pine\n3. Macaron: a half macaron with cayenne, cinnamon pear, caramel\n\nOf the wine pairings, the most interesting ones were the blanc de blanc, the Nebbiolo, the pinot, and the sparkling tokaji at the end. Our sommelier told us a lot of interesting stuff behind each of the wines. We also tried some cocktails (they have a full liquor license now.)\n\nI love the open kitchen, and you're allowed to go over and look and talk to the chefs.

Next snack was albacore marinated in kalamata olives.  Now I'm generally not in favor of eating foie gras due to how it's made, but I made an exception for Lazy Bear.  It was served with strawberry and sorel and was buttery delicious.  Next snack was my favorite, a crispy potato wrapped around creme fraiche and caviar, kind of like a fancy Pringle, yum!  The final snack was fried sweetbreads with pickled watermelon that had some nice spice to it; cannot go wrong with something fried, especially the way they made it.\n\nWhen the snacks were done, each couple or group was escorted one by one down to their seats at one of the two 20-person tables.  We were lucky to get one of the seats up front, so had a decent view of some of the food prep.  We were served a refreshing little \"grape soda\" that was more like a mini smoothie, served as a palate cleanser.  For each course, one of the chefs came out to describe the components and prep.  Sommelier poured the wine for those who got the beverage course.  I found the descriptions to be really interesting and fun, without a bit of pretension.\n\nFirst course was delicious spelt & rye dinner roll with their house cultured butter.  Absolutely delicious.  Next course was one of our favorites of the night:  tomato panzanella with beef carpaccio (wagyu beef) with avocado, padron conserva, and seaweed foccacia.  Melt in your mouth goodness with some crispiness of the focaccia, amazing flavors!  Next was the legumes course, with snap peas, grean beens, wax beens in a butter and bell pepper relish.  The next course included a vegetable that I think most hadn't heard of before:  celtuce stem & leaves, a veggie whose stem was kind of like asparagus, but different flavor and consistency; anyway, was interesting and delicious.  Then came the fresh corn grits topped with duck ham.  It was the wonderful simplicity of corn and butter, and the duck ham kinda tasted like prosciutto.  Next came the grilled Berkshire pork shoulder with peaches, turnips, succulents, and stonefruit; juicy goodness!  The final meat course was some delicious wagyu ribeye cap with tomato, black garlic, and eggplant.\n\nThree dessert courses were served next.  The first was a very interesting and super tasty white sesame tofu, green melon, sake, and rose geranium. Next came a delicious mix of blue corn masa, blueberry ice cream and fresh blueberries, with a whiskey based sauce or pudding.  The evening ended with a trio of treats:  caramelized apricot with hazelnut and milk chocolate, red velvet cake with berries, and semifreddo Vietnamese coffee.  \n\nOverall, this was such a unique experience.  The food and service were top notch.  This could have easily been a snooty place, but it was quite the opposite.  All of the chefs, servers, and sommelier were so nice and seemed to be so genuinely in love with what they do.

They start serving food promptly at 6:00 and if you show up late you're going to miss courses. The first snacks are served in the upstairs area - get there early for sitting room but the communal dining experience is kind of awkward. Unfortunately the servers were not always timely in the way they brought out the amuses - granted, it's hard to systematically distribute courses when everyone is just kind of sitting around all over the place, but it's awkward when the people sitting next to us received their second amuse while we had yet to receive the first.\n\nUpstairs we had 7 snacks and a complimentary mead-based punch beverage - the whipped scrambled eggs with bacon/maple/hot sauce, shigoku oyster, a tray of 4 duck treats (duck liver mousse on a toasted brioche, duck confit hush puppy, duck rillette, duck slim jim), and a duck bone marrow/cheddar fondue with vegetable crudites.

They have an open kitchen so you can talk to and watch the chefs arranging each of the dishes.\n\nFirst, they brought out a brown butter brioche with cultured butter - SO GOOD! The brioche was perfectly buttery, with the brown butter adding a nutty tone. The cultured butter was also incredible - its aged for 2 years, adding a really sharp note.\n\nNext we had a dish with four different types of sorrels, basil-fed snails from Napa, near-raw spot prawns, geoduck clams, and barley that had been crisped in oil - solid salad-type entree. Then a charred onion and ham broth soup with a perfectly poached egg yolk, pickled apple, and scallion. Unfortunately my soup didn't come with the pickled apple.\n\nThen the mains - we had a butter-poached lobster cooked with saffron in a lobster reduction sauce  (my favorite dish of the night!) This was followed by squab with foie gras and pear. I was a big fan of the squab as well (probably my second favorite dish), the pairing of pear with the richness of the foie gras worked really well and the crispy skin of the squab was seared perfectly. After the squab was a wagyu ribeye marinated in Vietnamese-style fish sauce with this Thai-style lemongrass sauce - tasty, but I wasn't that impressed.\n\nThen the desserts - honestly these were the biggest disappointment of the evening mostly because they added hot sauce to dishes that I felt didn't need it. First, we had a yummy kiwi-based palate cleanser with buttermilk panna cotta, guava jelly, and meringue. This was followed by a sticky toffee pudding that was tasty if not for the the shock at tasting hot sauce accompanying the creme fraiche, butter sorbet, and toffee/date/walnut-y cake. They then brought out a presentation of small treats - a rose-flavored macaron (once again, dusted with spicy powder), a caramel (my favorite of the desserts), a campari jelly, ice cream sandwich, and mocha cream cake bite.

The price tag is steep, but I would definitely recommend it and personally would dine here again and again - some things are just worth it! The food is amazing and I will get there in just a minute, but I have to say - thank you to the staff who all acknowledged and congratulated us on our engagement, for the card they all signed which was really the sweetest touch, and for giving us literally the best seats in the house (front nearest the kitchen, and unbeknownst to us, next to the owners of Elizabeth in Chicago - who were the loveliest people and made our experience even greater!). No amount of words could really do this place justice and I'm not sure any other establishment could ever top this one! \n\nThe restaurant is set up for communal dining which is just a fantastic way to meet people and this concept works so well in SF one of the most friendly and progressive cities in the country! Additionally, there is a set menu, which alleviates the need to think/decide what you might want. Everyone enjoys the same food (like a family!) and of course they can accommodate for any food restrictions. We loved all the small bites upstairs before our seating (and the welcome cocktail was seriously addictive, we may have asked for a second..!), and all the dishes after were impeccable. \n\nUpstairs, the grilled foie gras (with blood orange marmalade), and the crab toast were divine and the whipped scrambled eggs was so interesting and delicious! They had this fried mushroom which was really good too (and is actually served at their new bar/restaurant True Laurel). Downstairs, the clam dish had me reeling, and who doesn't enjoy some cultured butter?! The halibut was lovely and the rack of lamb to end it was great too! I was already full by the time dessert came around (altogether they serve about 12-14 dishes). If it's your first time I would recommend a wine pairing! My fiance and I shared one and it was a good amount for us both! You can browse and get up to look at the kitchen, talk to your neighbors, staff etc. that is all encouraged!  \n\nThe idea and planning behind Lazy Bear really makes a visit here not just a place for dinner, but a full experience for all members involved. One lady we met said it was her 3rd time here and she should return again (me too!). Every experience is different, menu items change, and they are constantly improving!

The snacks included:\n\n(1). Whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple and hot sauce (5/5) - very unique and excellent way to start the evening. \n(2).  Shigoku Oyster with preserved winter citrus (4/5) - it's fairly standard fare in SF at the moment. \n(3).

The chefs introduce each course in the main dining area and courses served downstairs included:\n\n(1). Spelt and Rye Dinner Roll with house cultured butter (5/5) - the bread was fabulous and the butter was even better.  To me, the bread has become a real important part of the fine dining experience and this is probably the second best bread I've had in SF (the brioche at Atelier Crenn is the first).\n(2).  Geoduck clam with sorrels, watermelon radish and oro blanco (3/5) - decent geoduck dish but I was just at Coi and their geoduck dish was better.\n(3).  White asparagus with Tsar Nicoulai caviar (4/5) - this dish is good but I've had something similar at Quince not so long ago and that was better.\n(4).  Ham and barley broth with fudgy egg yolk, pink lady apple and charred onion (5/5) - this was the perfect intermezzo and special mention to the consistency and creaminess of the egg yolk. \n(5).  Local halibut with artichoke, stinging nettle, ramps and hollandaise (5/5) - Perfection. No other words to describe it. \n(6).  Grilled rack of lamb with broccolini and kumquat (5/5) - this is, by far, the best piece of lamb I've had and I particularly enjoyed the fat. Surprisingly, the veggies were competing well with the lamb in this dish.  \n(7).  Rhubarb compote with coconut cream and sorrel granita (3/5) - I've had a better version of what this is trying to do at Campton Place (using kiwi instead of rhubarb). \n(8).  Honey with banana and walnut (1/5) - this was not good at all. The banana really overpowered this. A nice chocolate mille-feuille or ice cream/sorbet would have been perfect in this spot. \n(9).  Forager's Tisane Tea (5/5) - really happy with this at the end of the savory courses and while eating the desserts. \n(10).  Mignardises include calamansi lime/Fresno Chile gummi bear, dark chocolate brownie, prickly pear macaron and almond/chocolate/pink peppercorn nugget (5/5) - these are the most unique and tasty small bites I've had in SF and kudos for the creativity. \n\nIn terms of what was missing, I wish they somehow incorporated black truffle in the meal.

Being Valentines weekend, the cost of admission came out to nearly $300 per person, and that's without the over the top beverage pairings!

Mmm...Uber-y.\n\nWhen my girlfriend and I arrived, we were given a lay of the land before being escorted upstairs to the mezzanine for cocktails and snacks.  The decor makes the space feel like the most incredible log cabin in the woods and is perfectly sized to feel intimate but not cramped when full of dinner guests.  The amazing view over the dining room is a tease, contributing to the build-up of anticipating that I've been feeling for weeks.\n\nI'm not sure what is normally served, but we started off with a nice dry champagne and special spiked punch blend (which was incredibly complex and refreshing).  To accompany the beverages, Lazy Bear likes to get things started with some amazing appetizers (or snacks as they call them).  Ours mezzanine snacks included:\n\n1) Whipped scrambled eggs - Breakfast in a shot, consisting of a whipped egg foam with bacon fat and an amazing hot sauce that I wish they would bottle.\n\n2) Shigoku oyster - Fresh oyster shooter served with an oyster broth and frozen kiwi sauce.  It had incredibly clean flavors, though the kiwi seeds could be a little overpowering to the delicate flavor of the sweet oyster.\n\n3) Beef tartare - Served on a brown rice cracker with shaved foie gras - incredibly delicate flavors and textures that melt in your mouth.\n\n4) T\u00eate de moine - Celery root mousse with Swiss raw cow's milk cheese, compressed dehydrated Asian pear, and pine tips.  Amazing texture and flavor from the perfect little bite.\n\nI ordered the \"exquisite\" Ruhstaller to cleanse the palette before we were led down to the dining room and our assigned seats.  Waiting for us was a Lazy Bear field guide (a menu booklet for note-taking) and our final snack:\n\n5) Caviar - An homage to San Francisco featuring a sourdough cracker, caviar, and a pur\u00e9e.  Again, amazing sourdough flavors and textures.\n\nChef David Barzelay opened dinner with the protocol for the evening and told the story of their absolutely incredible, mouth-watering spelt & rye dinner roll served with their signature cultured butter.\n\n6) Going on 3 years old, their butter culture produces a product that reminded me of a strong cheese.  The combination was like nothing I've ever had, and I yearned (and continue to yearn) for more.\n\nIf you've never had the privilege of dining at Lazy Bear before, each dish is served with a description from the chef who concocted its creation.  Between dishes, guests are encouraged to meet their neighbors, roam throughout the dining room, visit the bar, or even stop by the kitchen to watch (or in my case to photograph) as the chefs meticulously placed each component of the dishes during plating.  As expected, each dish was incredible thoughtful, and told a story.\n\n7) Bay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk, and bergamot.  The seafood was incredible fresh and tender, with a slight sourness, and I love the bite of the geoduck.  The chef himself foraged the spinach used in the dish.\n\n8) Steelhead trout with a fried stinging nettle, hedgehog mushroom, butterball potatoes, and an amazing smoked salmon roe.  The fish was served with a butterball potato, green garlic, and stinging nettle mash that inherited a nice green color and had just a hint of the subtle garlic flavors.\n\n9) Poussin with lettuce and spring onion.  It's a 21-day old chicken breast that is sous vide to maintain it's incredibly tender texture with subtle, clean flavors.  The chicken was raised on a diet of lacto-fermented grains which was apparent in the meat.\n\n10) Poussin Bouillon - The egg yolk fudge is served with fermented grains and spring onion, and includes a stock made from the chicken itself as a table-side pour over.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the evening because of its richness and the level of technique involved.  It also felt familiar, like a dish I grew up with...

The dining atrium is open air, so you can watch the chefs making the magic happen right in front of you.  You are encouraged to interact with other guests and the chefs; a foodie's heaven.  \n\nThe first half of the meal is spent upstairs where small snacks are served to you alongside cocktails.\n\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs with Bacon, Maple, Hotsauce:  A\nServed frothy in a shot glass.  Amazing flavors and even better texture.  Really satisfying.  Wish I had ten more.  \n\nShigoku Oyster and Grapefruit Kosho:  B\nVery ordinary.  Freshness was mediocre.  \n\nKing Salmon with Pickled Green Strawberry:  A+\nSemi ripe strawberry offered perfect acidity.  Salmon was really fatty and cured well.  No qualms here.\n\nFoie Gras with Kumquat, Fennel, and Brown Butter Brioche:  A+\nFoie gras was incredibly rich, and the creaminess was a perfect juxtaposition to the crisp brown butter brioche.  It was almost a bit too rich, but so full of goodness that I had to eat it all.\n\nArtichoke Dip with Aged Cheddar, Croutons, Lemon:  B\nA bit unrefined.  Tasted like something you'd eat at a superbowl party.  Still delicious nonetheless but really didn't offer much continuity with regards to the other dishes.  \n\nYou are then asked to join in the main dining room for the entrees.\n\nGrilled Seaweed Foccacia with House Made Cultured Butter:  A++\nA simple dish, but incredibly well executed.  At the bottom of it, it was just a piece of bread.  However, the kombu flavors were incredibly apparent and the cultured butter was good enough to eat with a spoon.  Execution was absolutely spot on.   \n\nSweet Pea Custard with Steelhead Roe, Pea Shell Mint Sauce, Spring Onion:  A\nRefreshing way to start the meal.  Enough funk from the steelhead roe.  The greens offered great texture and the sweet pea custard was delicious.  \n\nBroth of Toasted Grains with Egg Yolk Fudge, Porcini, Baby Leaks:  A+++\nThe egg yolk fudge was amazing.  An isolated yolk that was barely cooked.  Covered in a hearty broth, which brought the dish to slightly above room temp.  If you like poached eggs, you'll definitely get a kick out of this dish.  Another highlight of the night.  \n\nHalibut with Lettuce, Asparagus, Brown Butter Hollandaise:  A-\nHalibut was cooked perfectly.  Execution was great, but not as innovative as any of the other courses.  \n\nRabbit with Morels and Favas:  B+\nRabbit was sous-vide style but was overseasoned.\n\nLamb Rack with Date, Mustards, Farro, Blood Orange, Olive, Garum:  A+++\nAnother highlight of the night.  The lamb had an incredible amount of fat, and wasn't particularly gamy.  The blood orange and mustards really helped balance the pungent lamb.  Cooked to a perfet medium rare.  \n\nRhubarb with Chamomile, Pink Peppercorn:  A+\nThis was magic.  I lifted the bowl so I could drink the bottom.  It was that good.  \n\nOats with Lavendar, Honey, Almond:  A++\nPerfect way to end.  Not overly sweet.  Perfect in execution again.\n\nMenu was complex, but I left completely satisfied.  The execution was perfect, and the chef interaction left no questions unanswered and no rocks unturned.  The price was just right considering the precision of the staff and the innovative experience overall.

After an hour or so or when everyone from the first seating left, they accompanied us down to the communal tables. At the tables we are given booklets and pencils---great idea! to write down notes of what we thought about the dishes. When each dish was served a chef would introduce and describe the dish. Everyone was welcomed to go to the open kitchen and ask questions, take pictures, talk to them, or observe them in action. \n\nOur second time was about a month later and the awe of \"different\" dining experience already happened and we expected everything which ruined some of the experience for us.

In order to get a table you have to sign up on their website.  You will be notified by email of when tickets will be on sale on their website.  I will log in 15 mins in advance just in case tickets are released ahead of noon.  I manged to snag a reservation right at 11:54 a.m.  You will need to pay in advance which makes it great because you don't have to worry about the check after being stuffed.  \n\nMy friend and i arrived at Lazy Bear right on time. We were escorted upstairs where they check us in and allowed us to lounge around with other patrons.   I love how it's a log cabin feeling because it makes me more relaxed.   The servers will go to each individuals with their silver platter and introduce you to the \"snacks\".  You can also help yourself to the spiked punch bowl to go along with your snacks. So let me go over the snacks really quick\n\nWhipped scrambled eggs- with bacon, maple and hot sauce- I love eggs, so i might be biased to this.  This is served warm, so you will need to start from the bottom and work your way to the top.  You can taste the smoked bacon mixed in with the lightly fluffed egg and hot sauce. i loved this dish\n\nShigoku oyster- a chilled dish, and you can taste how fresh the oyster was. \n\nDuck liver Mousse on a toast with grapes and walnuts-  when you eat this all your memories of your love for foie gras will come back to you.  It hurts so much for me to be reminded of such a good dish.. \n\nBlue cheese custard- with carrot and ham.  - ok i normally 99.9% of the time i hate blue cheese.  However, i liked how the blue cheese was not too overpowering. I surprisingly liked this \"snack\"\n\nAfter the snacks they will take each party down one by one to be seated.  Once you are seated Chef David will introduce himself to the crowd and you start off with bread and butter and other entrees\n\nDutch Crunch pain Epi- Bread and butter as i would like to call it. This was served with a sourdough bread and the softest lightest better you will ever taste. I'm not huge on sourdough but again, i ended up liking the bread.\n\nBay Scallops- I was surprised by how big the pieces were.  I liked how this was served with a sweet yogurt sauce\n\nSunflower Parts- this was a black cod with persimmons and cooked in brown butter. I never thought brown butter could taste this amazing. This was my favorite dish of the night.  The fish melts in your mouth and the persimmon was pureed .  I loved how fried the petals! I would come back just for this dish. \n\nMatsutake- this soup was on the lighter taste and it had a very strong mushroom taste.  We actually saw them make this soup, they boil it,in what looks like coffee makers. How cool is that?!\n\nGrilled Pork- I was disappointed with this dish. i didn't feel the pork was tender enough\n\nDuck- Another dish i was disappointed in, it was a little more tender than the pork.  I didn't feel this dish was anything too special. I did like the crispy cabbage it came with. \n\nAvocado ice cream with yuzu buttermilk- If you love avocado you will love this!  You can tell they made this, because it was so light!\n\nParsnip- Devil fruit cake. this was a little bit on to burnt side for me.\n\nTreats- earl grey macaron, sesame balls, this jelly thing, ice cream smores, and a pistachio tart.   I have the say the best treat was the earl grey macaron and the ice cream smore.   The sesame ball was very avg and a little bit on the hard side.  The other desserts were pretty avg.  \n\nOn a brighter note, the moscato was very smooth. I loved it\n\nThe service here was great, but parking here is a pain.

For the Tuesday we went, dinner was $140/person including tax/tip. There are two seatings each night (6pm & 8:30pm), and we opted for 6pm. They lead you upstairs in the loft area for \"Snacks\", and you also get a free mixed drink. We tried:\n\nSnacks\n-Whipped Scrambled Eggs (Bacon, Maple, Hot Sauce, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WHryUERX279emSpcq3ddlw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok- the spoon wasn't quite long enough to reach to the hot sauce on the bottom initially, so I ended up with a ton of hot sauce for the last couple of bites. \n-Kumamoto Oyster (Tomato, Caviar, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=deyqkkAGLID-NigyBPzN9A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- super fresh and delicious.

However, I wish they gave you some carbs with the roe.\n-Concord Grape Soda (Lemon Verbena, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2PD4tmY-Ti3pL5OL4VCJhw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This wasn't my cup of.. soda. I think they said this was partially fermented, and I did not enjoy it at all- took about two sips and gave up after that.\n\nSit Down Meal Downstairs\n-Matsutake & Cypress Broth (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4eVUfKadRlKvannBf9oNfQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Very mild/bland broth- didn't do much for me.\n-Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll (House Cultured Butter, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nI0t-GHtQ55mqbm8cC2EEg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I didn't enjoy the tangy and thin house cultured butter, which had more of a yogurt consistency. I also wasn't a fan of the spelt/rye roll, since it wasn't as fluffy as a traditional Parker House Roll.\n-Modorigatsuo (Pomegranate, Beets, Pink Peppercorn, Meyer Lemon, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=N4S2Y_PMhW7HTg9D4Lp0bA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok, not too much flavor.\n-Lamb Tartare (Sunflower and its Seeds, Pear, Sumac, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tzMWs96ibIBdeSEp_9JDxw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not too gamey but again not too flavorful.

The ribeye was super tender and melted it your mouth, and I loved the kalbi inspired flavors. \n\nDesserts\n-Olive Oil (Apple, Lemon, Green Herbs, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ekSGrl8JTkF-FxQTjrf3ww&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I didn't like this at all- it was too creamy and the herbs were super strong tasting.\n-Black Sesame (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UTcnxGYvgTit8bibjDTnog&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The cassis pairing didn't work for me here. However, the \"cake\" was nice and moist, and the ice cream had a nice nutty flavor.\n\nTreats\n-From L to R: Semifreddo (Vietnamese Coffee), Sticky Toffee Pudding (Fig, Red Walnuts), Earl Grey Macaron (Scotch, Pear, Ginger) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4CWR6KjuE43Ipx3dj5kA7w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: The semifreddo was by far the best dessert, and the pairing worked well together. I didn't like the flavors/ingredients in the other two.\n\nYou really have to be a fan of communal style seating to enjoy your experience. We didn't like that the chefs spend a lot of time explaining each dish, so your conversations are continually interrupted. Service is great though, and they have good music.

Fortunately, my friend scored tickets just as they were released and I was invited to join in on the fun along with Nina Y.. I think the ~$130/pp we paid seems a bit high but think of it as a dinner party experience and delicious food. We went on a Tuesday night for the first seating. We all work in the city and barted to that direction so it was pretty easy. Might be a challenge looking for parking though. \n\nPRELUDE: Front\n\nCheck in at the door. Give your name. Someone will escort you upstairs (and note: they won't forget your name)\n\nSCENE I: The upstairs gathering\n\nI recommend getting to the event early especially if you're the first seating. You definitely want to get some of the limited seating/table area upstairs if you want to be able to set plates/drinks down or, if you're a yelper like me, to get good lighting to take pictures as it is very dim. We were served five amuse bouches (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). They were little interesting bites. I actually liked the whipped scrambled eggs a lot in their simplicity of ingredients but complexity of texture! Also, as I was allergic to cucumber (p.s. they are great about food allergies) they allowed me to substitute the punch of a glass of champagne.\n\nSCENE II: Downstairs\n\nCan my dining room look like this? It's very modern decor (Imagine somewhere Eames chairs would fit but with more warmth and character). Everyone had assigned seating which you don't have to find yourself (they bring you there). Our fellow diners were cheerful and we exchanged hellos (but no obligation here to make new friends). They provide you with a small notebook and pencil allowing you to jot down notes about your dishes as the chef describes it or as you eat it. Also between courses you are encouraged to get up, walk around, observe the chefs cooking/plating (from a distance), and even ask them questions! It's an open kitchen.\n\nList of Dishes (I'll just say everything is amazing and highlight any fun facts):  Valentine's bread, \nSweet Pea Custard (This had salmon roe, I mentally told myself it wouldn't work, but it did. This was a mouthful of Spring), Charred Onion Broth (Egg yolk and pork fat. The depth of flavor was soul warming). Halibut (One of the chefs gave us their brining ratio and preparation method with sous vide). Rabbit (Served with snails that they raised and had been fed only with basil -- how long does that even take? I swear I tasted the basil). Lamb (on the bone with the right amount of fat). Rhubarb (an icy sorbet). Oats financier (yum. It was served with granola that reminded me of campfires and coffee).  Final Treats (5 different classic pastry chef deserts like a macaron and cream puff). \n\nFINI\n\nFood: There's a story behind every dish. David Barzelay (Owner/Head Chef) is fun and not too polished. He also allows every one of his chefs to express their creativity and lead on a course (including providing a brief intro the dish). \n\nService: Very professional. Each one of their seatings is a carefully choreographed party. The servers were very attentive. The chefs and kitchen staff were fun and friendly. We even took a picture at the end (unknowingly with all the folks having a blast behind us -- I guess we were the serious ones?) \n\nOverall: If you can go, do it. I'm not sure if its worth the premium to have it on a weekend night (what are you doing for 2-3 hours on a weekday night anyway?) as they serve the same food throughout. Like I said, it's not just a meal.

People should try it once. But once, is enough. It's more the hype and the cool experience that makes Lazy Bear fun to try. Do people ever go twice?\n\nIt's hard to get tickets, and when the tickets get released, we were scrambling on finding the right time to go within the next month so I was really excited to go. They start you off with a rum punch which was tasty, and a few appetizers upstairs. I thought the small bites were good, but underwhelming. The apps were a battered egg, foie gras, trout/salmon, fried artichoke chips, and an oyster. Great variety! I was disappointed the slush on the oyster was overpowering and took away from the oyster taste. \n\nAfter the apps, they take you downstairs to sit down in the communal tables. I love the set up and everything was so photogenic. It was really cool to go up to the open kitchen as well to watch them plate the dishes. Service was also spectacular. \n\nNow the food. The food was just not as great as they were describing. There were a few dishes I liked, but I remember one of the chefs explaining the lamb dish and he said it was the best lamb he's ever tasted. That definitely cannot be true, and if it is, then I would want to take him to some asian places or even Aziza who makes really great lamb. The rabbit was salty, but tender. I really enjoyed the barley soup broth with an egg yolk inside. That and the desserts were probably my favorite. I also really enjoyed the seaweed bread and cultivated butter that they made themselves. I also REALLY liked their pastry chef's desserts. All of the desserts were fantastic with great hints of something unique and memorable. Actually, the desserts for me, probably should have pushed this review from a 3 to a 4 star.\n\nOther than that, the food was underwhelming especially for the price. I thought they didn't use the right flavors for the dishes, and the halibut and rabbit were super salty. It's a hipster place, they tell you what they made, how they made it, and where they source it from. But would it be something I crave and want to go again?

When you first arrive you are brought upstairs and given some scotch punch. You can mix and mingle with other patrons, or just keep to yourself. The snack courses start promptly at your ticketed time, so I would get there early to secure a seated spot and enjoy drinks at a leisurely pace. The snacks are served cocktail party style and we pretty much liked all of them: Whipped Scrambled Eggs (great flavor and texture), Shigoku Oyster (melon accompanied it perfectly and did not overwhelm), Foie Gras (this tasted more like dessert to me), Cucumber Soda (well, I love cucumbers so this was a win for me), and Caviar (in a pringle roll...YUM). \n\nAfter the snack portion of the meal you are escorted to your seats to eat the rest of the meal at a communal table.

We had 6 more courses: Tomato Panzanella w/ribeye carpaccio (one of my faves), Legumes (beautiful presentation, bright flavors), Celtuce (savory and pretty hearty for a veg), Corn Grits (pretty rich), Pork Shoulder (this was just ok for me), and Miyazaki Ribeye (melt in your mouth good). Following these dishes we had 3 dessert courses. I usually love dessert, but wasn't a real fan of these unfortunately.\n\nOverall the food is pretty good, with a couple hits and misses for my taste buds. I wasn't completely blown away by anything in particular, but I will still remember what a great experience I had as a whole. I also got the drink pairing menu, but I would have preferred they spaced the drinks out more evenly. In the beginning I felt like my glass was empty for a long time, then at the end they came so fast that I couldn't keep up. You only get one drink during the cocktail party portion of the dinner.

Not only do I enjoy dinner parties, but it's my preferable way to entertain guests in my home.\n\nWhen I booked the reservation, which was easy to do after I read the page of instructions, I paid $156.60/person with my credit card. At the time of dining, you can decide if you want to add the wine pairing or mixed pairing for $65/person. If you do decide to add the pairing, a 20% tip is added and the total comes out to $84.83 with tax. Now that the shocking finances are out of the way, I can move on to the fun stuff.\n\nAs all the reviews mentioned, you start out upstairs with complimentary low alcohol punch, which tastes herbal and medicinal. Spacing upstairs is limited so the early bird gets the worm (or chair as in this case). Because the atmosphere is supposed to be dinner-party-like, my dining companion and I began talking to the people around us. However, people are shy and we had to dig for common ground. Eventually, we found another couple celebrating a birthday and found commonality with them while being served whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, hot sauce, shigoku oyster with citrus kosho froth (my photo came out grainy due to the low lighting), a platter of duck liver mousse with marmalade, duck confit hushpuppy, with black lime, duck rillette which is the quince fruit roll-up, and duck Slim Jim with sour cream and herbs. The last of the appetizers was a bowl of bone marrow and cheddar fondue (more like a broth) served with crudit\u00e9s. Out of the appetizers, the scrambled eggs served in a shot glass was my favorite.\n\nWhen it was time to move downstairs, the host seats you in pre-assigned seating. Hoping we would get to sit with the couple we had met upstairs, I was sorely disappointed when we were seated next to a  couple who didn't want to interact with us at all. Luckily, the restaurant welcomes you to move around, so the guests are encouraged to get out of their seats to observe the kitchen, talk with the chefs and staff, take pictures, write notes in the provided booklet so we weren't stuck with the unsociable couple who only wanted to talk between themselves and their phone. Uggh!\n\nCultured butter which tastes like cheese accompanied the brown butter brioche which was served first. Afterwards, the sorrel salad containing garden herbs, spot prawn, geoduck clam, barley, and miner's lettuce arrived and was challenging to eat because it contained 3 snails which our chef announced were fed only basil and then braised for a couple of hours. See photo. Although I've had snails many times before (here and in France), I must be out of practice because they kind of freaked me out seeing them in my salad. Seeing the miner's lettuce reminded me of hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains with my daughter's pre-school class whose teacher would pick up various items along the trail for the class to touch or eat....like miner's lettuce. When the charred onion broth was served with Tennessee Ham, an egg yolk, pea-sized apple balls, and scallion, the chef's description of the egg yolk was fascinating. A raw egg yolk is set in 67\u00b0F oil overnight to \"cure\" it. After hot broth is poured over the yolk, you can cut it in half and it still keeps its shape and has lots of flavor. \n\nAfter the starters the saffron lobster was served with rice grits which was very much like risotto made with lobster broth. Interestingly, the chips that accompanied this dish were made from spot prawn roe that were dehydrated, mixed with rice then dehydrated again, then lightly fried. When the grilled squab arrived, I was not only excited about the squab itself, which I hadn't eaten since I was a little girl in Mexico, but it was served with foie gras which was banned (but recently lifted) in CA for several years much to my dismay. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. Mixing things up a bit, the wagyu ribeye arrived with a Thai coconut green curry sauce. Admittedly, the beef wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth as I had hoped, but still the combo was amazing. \n\nEnding the meal with a variety of sweets is my kind of meal. Creatively served with creme anglaise, cream cheese, sparkling water and fennel was an all carrot plate: pressed dried carrot, carrot granita and carrot boba. Following the vegetable dessert was the sticky toffee pudding with a brown butter sorbet, walnut brittle, and sweetened creme fraiche. Rounding out the desserts was a selection of treats: chili rose macaron topped with togarashi, negroni gelee, toasted s'more, a caramel wrapped in edible rice paper and walnut mousse cake.

The place is painted black on the outside with a stripe of red and black checkered design - love the sneakiness though :)\n\nArrived at 8pm for the second seating for 2.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Almanac beer (sour) and the Flight of Beer during our wait for our seating. While we waited, we were offered hors d'oeuvres!\n- Whipped Scrambled Eggs: This came in what looks like a double-shot shot glass with foamy egg at the top & a kick of spiciness at the bottom with bacon bits and chives all over. Very tasteful!\n- Albacore: Peanut, grape & black olive under a small piece of albacore - this had an interesting texture when you eat it all in one bite, but surprisingly good altogether.\n- Foie Gras: Usually not a fan of foie gras, but you don't taste that usual gamey taste when it was on top of a strawberry cracker & sorrel! \n- Caviar: The potato chip exterior that wraps the caviar with sour cream was also one of my favorite hors d'oeuvres of the evening!\n- Hot Sweetbreads: A bit too spicy for me (can't really handle spicy) but it was very tasty!

The aesthetics were amazing & so particular. I also did think it was fancy for them to fold up my napkin & tidy up my seat everytime I walked away - talk about amazing service! Main courses:\n- Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll: From the butter to the bread, they made this themselves. Warm & toasty. A bit on the saltier side but I still gobbled it up because it was yummy.\n- Tomato Panzanella: One of the dishes that stood out to me most with a thin carpaccio of Miyazaki Ribeye above a layer of avocado, padron conserva & seaweed focaccia. Cutting each bit with all items in one spoonful had so much texture & taste, that I wanted MORE! \n- Legumes: Summer squash, bell, pepper, fennel, and saffron nage all in one with a buttery foamy sauce around it just made everything mesh so well together. Each legume was sweet on its own & mixed with the buttery sauce just topped it off for me :)\n- Celtuce Stem & Leaves: common Chinese veggie, but the way they made this was different from how I'd eat at home. The took the inside of the celtuce & kept it crunchy without overcooking & topped it with almond and chicken skin bits for extra flavor - I would have been happy with the celtuce stem itself, but the bits they added on top put it on another level!\n- Fresh Corn Grits: OMG CORN! They cooked the flavor of the corn just perfectly because all of the corn taste was just perfectly there! I am a huge fan of corn and I gobbled this up wanting and craving more! They had a bit of what looked like proscuitto on top which tasted good with the corn, but on its own it was salty. Man do I miss this delightful taste!\n- Grilled Berkshire Pork Shoulder: The fatty part of this pork was sweet & yummy. Different that it was cooked with grilled peach, turnip, succulents, & stonefruit tare - but they went  surprisingly good with the savory taste of the juicy pork.\n- Mizyaki Ribeye Cap: Mmm.. how i love wagyu! This was probably why our meal costed so much but I loved every bit of this fatty meat! It was cooked at perfect melt-in-my-mouth-ness and paired with tomatoes, black garlic, and eggplant - boy would I want some more of this right now! \n- White Sesame: This was probably my least favorite of the night, IF i had to choose one. Subtle & not too sweet of a sesame pudding with bits of green melon & sake.\n- Blue Corn: One of my top! Who would of thought kettle corn and, blueberry ice cream & cake would go so well together!

There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat.

Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones.

Maybe it was the fact that pop-ups and communal dining are no longer a novelty, especially in the Bay Area. But, I really think it was the fact that 2 tickets, 2 drinks, and corkage for 1 bottle ($50) put me out nearly $500. That's like, two fancy dinners at Chez Panisse, but you get about 1/2 of the food. I realize that quantity isn't the end goal here, but the economist in me couldn't help but lament at the opportunity cost. \n\nMy main disappointment was the approach to substitutions. I normally don't eat meat, but I indicated to the chefs that using animal fats/broths would be okay. I figured I should be flexitarian to enjoy the full experience. Usually, constraint breeds creativity but I think in this case Lazy Bear just got lazy. Most restaurants will sub some sort of protein if you're not going to have meat. Not the case at Lazy Bear. \n\nA few examples from our 12-course meal... descriptions are followed by nearly verbatim comments from the server (service is attentive but fairly impersonal):\n- Foie gras, brown rice, some veggies // \"Hi Sherry, so you're getting the same dish, without the foie. Yea?\" Ummm... yeah okay, I mean, what choice do I have? \n- Lamb tartare // \"Hi Sherry, so you've got the same garnish, but we're serving you goat cheese instead of the lamb.\" The cheese was pretty tasty and foamed (a new preparation to me), but \n- Duck & duck sausage // \"Here we have a carrot that has been grilled and charred. And you've still got the quince on the side, yea?\" So people got 2 pieces of meat and quince, but I got a single carrot and quince. \n- Wagyu // \"Okay, same deal - you've got the same dish as the others, except you have no meat and more of the garnish, yea?\" Great, my partner has this fantastically marbled piece of meat and I have an extra piece of eggplant and a few extra baby tomatoes. \n\nEven though I didn't feel like I got a lot of value for my ticket, I do recognize that the kitchen staff are exceptionally talented. That carrot was tender yet substantial; how they avoided making it mushy is beyond me. And they coaxed some amazing flavors out of the starter snacks (my favorite was a Kumamoto oyster on a bed of tomato puree, sprinkled with a touch of tomato leaf oil. Sublime, sweet, subtle). The butter is AMAZING - made from 3-year-old bacteria culture, well-salted, super creamy... the rye and spelt roll was just a convenient excuse for me to inhale that rich butter. \n\nListen, Lazy Bear. Substitutions are fine. But at least make it a true substitution rather than just taking ingredients away. Give me a 1 for 1, not a 1 for 0. Everything was delicious, and your kitchen turns out fine dishes. But I feel pretty shorted, yea?", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Of all the dishes, my loves would have to be the foie gras (ate it before I could even snap a pic), the fried-chicken-like sweet bread, the rhubarb dessert, the pistachio/beet/chocolate dessert and the iced latte.

Anyway, Lazy Bear exceeded expectations and the well-deserved hype that surrounds it.\n\nWe arrived around 8 and were escorted upstairs to the mezzanine area.  We were promptly served some delicious punch. I'm usually not a cocktail person, but this was yum; some sort of lemon-vodka-aloe thing.  We were served several delicious \"snacks\".  We got the beverage pairing, so started with a glass of champagne (don't remember the name since they ran out of the original one, they gave us a bit of an upgrade--yay!).  Was a lot of fun watching the food prep from above, excellent birds-eye view.\n\nSnacks started with whipped scrambled eggs, which is apparently one of their standard items; would definitely make sure you get your spoon all the way to the bottom of the glass to get the delicious hot sauce and maple syrup to mix in with the eggs.  Next snack was albacore marinated in kalamata olives.  Now I'm generally not in favor of eating foie gras due to how it's made, but I made an exception for Lazy Bear.  It was served with strawberry and sorel and was buttery delicious.  Next snack was my favorite, a crispy potato wrapped around creme fraiche and caviar, kind of like a fancy Pringle, yum!  The final snack was fried sweetbreads with pickled watermelon that had some nice spice to it; cannot go wrong with something fried, especially the way they made it.\n\nWhen the snacks were done, each couple or group was escorted one by one down to their seats at one of the two 20-person tables.  We were lucky to get one of the seats up front, so had a decent view of some of the food prep.  We were served a refreshing little \"grape soda\" that was more like a mini smoothie, served as a palate cleanser.  For each course, one of the chefs came out to describe the components and prep.  Sommelier poured the wine for those who got the beverage course.  I found the descriptions to be really interesting and fun, without a bit of pretension.\n\nFirst course was delicious spelt & rye dinner roll with their house cultured butter.  Absolutely delicious.  Next course was one of our favorites of the night:  tomato panzanella with beef carpaccio (wagyu beef) with avocado, padron conserva, and seaweed foccacia.  Melt in your mouth goodness with some crispiness of the focaccia, amazing flavors!  Next was the legumes course, with snap peas, grean beens, wax beens in a butter and bell pepper relish.  The next course included a vegetable that I think most hadn't heard of before:  celtuce stem & leaves, a veggie whose stem was kind of like asparagus, but different flavor and consistency; anyway, was interesting and delicious.  Then came the fresh corn grits topped with duck ham.  It was the wonderful simplicity of corn and butter, and the duck ham kinda tasted like prosciutto.  Next came the grilled Berkshire pork shoulder with peaches, turnips, succulents, and stonefruit; juicy goodness!  The final meat course was some delicious wagyu ribeye cap with tomato, black garlic, and eggplant.\n\nThree dessert courses were served next.  The first was a very interesting and super tasty white sesame tofu, green melon, sake, and rose geranium. Next came a delicious mix of blue corn masa, blueberry ice cream and fresh blueberries, with a whiskey based sauce or pudding.  The evening ended with a trio of treats:  caramelized apricot with hazelnut and milk chocolate, red velvet cake with berries, and semifreddo Vietnamese coffee.  \n\nOverall, this was such a unique experience.  The food and service were top notch.  This could have easily been a snooty place, but it was quite the opposite.  All of the chefs, servers, and sommelier were so nice and seemed to be so genuinely in love with what they do.  While the price to go to Lazy Bear is high, the food quality and overall experience are so excellent, that I think it is somewhat worth it.

They're open Tuesday - Saturday with two seatings, 6:00 and 8:15pm. Be ready to purchase and charge your card right when tickets come out! The ticket prices vary depending on the night you purchase, and on top of that they add a 20% service charge so we paid around $470 for 3 guests, not including the beverage/cocktail pairing.\n\nDO NOT BE LATE! They start serving food promptly at 6:00 and if you show up late you're going to miss courses. The first snacks are served in the upstairs area - get there early for sitting room but the communal dining experience is kind of awkward. Unfortunately the servers were not always timely in the way they brought out the amuses - granted, it's hard to systematically distribute courses when everyone is just kind of sitting around all over the place, but it's awkward when the people sitting next to us received their second amuse while we had yet to receive the first.\n\nUpstairs we had 7 snacks and a complimentary mead-based punch beverage - the whipped scrambled eggs with bacon/maple/hot sauce, shigoku oyster, a tray of 4 duck treats (duck liver mousse on a toasted brioche, duck confit hush puppy, duck rillette, duck slim jim), and a duck bone marrow/cheddar fondue with vegetable crudites. Of the snacks, the duck liver mousse and the fondue were my favorite. Although they're famous for the whipped scrambled eggs, I wasn't that impressed with what was essentially egg-flavored foam with bacony hot sauce.\n\nAfter you finish up the snacks, they lead you down for the rest of the meal, and a different chef will come out and explain the dish to the entire room. People are seated in two long wooden tables but once again I'm not the biggest fan of communal dining. It's hard to have a conversation and you kind of feel like you're perpetually in small-talk mode or half eavesdropping on the people next to you. They have an open kitchen so you can talk to and watch the chefs arranging each of the dishes.\n\nFirst, they brought out a brown butter brioche with cultured butter - SO GOOD! The brioche was perfectly buttery, with the brown butter adding a nutty tone. The cultured butter was also incredible - its aged for 2 years, adding a really sharp note.\n\nNext we had a dish with four different types of sorrels, basil-fed snails from Napa, near-raw spot prawns, geoduck clams, and barley that had been crisped in oil - solid salad-type entree. Then a charred onion and ham broth soup with a perfectly poached egg yolk, pickled apple, and scallion. Unfortunately my soup didn't come with the pickled apple.\n\nThen the mains - we had a butter-poached lobster cooked with saffron in a lobster reduction sauce  (my favorite dish of the night!) This was followed by squab with foie gras and pear. I was a big fan of the squab as well (probably my second favorite dish), the pairing of pear with the richness of the foie gras worked really well and the crispy skin of the squab was seared perfectly. After the squab was a wagyu ribeye marinated in Vietnamese-style fish sauce with this Thai-style lemongrass sauce - tasty, but I wasn't that impressed.\n\nThen the desserts - honestly these were the biggest disappointment of the evening mostly because they added hot sauce to dishes that I felt didn't need it. First, we had a yummy kiwi-based palate cleanser with buttermilk panna cotta, guava jelly, and meringue. This was followed by a sticky toffee pudding that was tasty if not for the the shock at tasting hot sauce accompanying the creme fraiche, butter sorbet, and toffee/date/walnut-y cake. They then brought out a presentation of small treats - a rose-flavored macaron (once again, dusted with spicy powder), a caramel (my favorite of the desserts), a campari jelly, ice cream sandwich, and mocha cream cake bite. We also ordered an iced coffee to go with dessert and it was incredible - definitely recommend!\n\nDefinitely a spot going to at least once and the perfect gift for foodies!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-01-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Then off to the races foie gras moose.

Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones. None of them were amazing like the first dessert, but they were all really good.

The foie gras was probably my favorite overall because I just love foie. \n\nThen we moved downstairs and had: \nMadre's Reviver: OH MY GOD. So delicious of a drink. The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones.

The decor of the main dining space is lovely with nice decor\n\n- Food - I really liked the food. There is a major focus on creativity, flavors and clearly a lot of effort in even the smallest of ingredients. The consomme dish was lacking but the sweet pea custard, halibut, lamb were delicious. \n\nWine - a tad disappointing. Our party, and the parties around us (some who came for the 5th time) generally agree that the wine pairings are not worth the money and folks should stick to cocktails.

But not worth the $75 wine pairing price tag. Stick to cocktails, folks\n\nService - this is where most of the improvement is needed.

"], "author": "Monica S.", "review": "For my dining companion's special birthday, I chose to celebrate at LB because not only was the food rated highly, but the restaurant was noted for its dinner-party-like atmosphere. Not only do I enjoy dinner parties, but it's my preferable way to entertain guests in my home.\n\nWhen I booked the reservation, which was easy to do after I read the page of instructions, I paid $156.60/person with my credit card. At the time of dining, you can decide if you want to add the wine pairing or mixed pairing for $65/person. If you do decide to add the pairing, a 20% tip is added and the total comes out to $84.83 with tax. Now that the shocking finances are out of the way, I can move on to the fun stuff.\n\nAs all the reviews mentioned, you start out upstairs with complimentary low alcohol punch, which tastes herbal and medicinal. Spacing upstairs is limited so the early bird gets the worm (or chair as in this case). Because the atmosphere is supposed to be dinner-party-like, my dining companion and I began talking to the people around us. However, people are shy and we had to dig for common ground. Eventually, we found another couple celebrating a birthday and found commonality with them while being served whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, hot sauce, shigoku oyster with citrus kosho froth (my photo came out grainy due to the low lighting), a platter of duck liver mousse with marmalade, duck confit hushpuppy, with black lime, duck rillette which is the quince fruit roll-up, and duck Slim Jim with sour cream and herbs. The last of the appetizers was a bowl of bone marrow and cheddar fondue (more like a broth) served with crudit\u00e9s. Out of the appetizers, the scrambled eggs served in a shot glass was my favorite.\n\nWhen it was time to move downstairs, the host seats you in pre-assigned seating. Hoping we would get to sit with the couple we had met upstairs, I was sorely disappointed when we were seated next to a  couple who didn't want to interact with us at all. Luckily, the restaurant welcomes you to move around, so the guests are encouraged to get out of their seats to observe the kitchen, talk with the chefs and staff, take pictures, write notes in the provided booklet so we weren't stuck with the unsociable couple who only wanted to talk between themselves and their phone. Uggh!\n\nCultured butter which tastes like cheese accompanied the brown butter brioche which was served first. Afterwards, the sorrel salad containing garden herbs, spot prawn, geoduck clam, barley, and miner's lettuce arrived and was challenging to eat because it contained 3 snails which our chef announced were fed only basil and then braised for a couple of hours. See photo. Although I've had snails many times before (here and in France), I must be out of practice because they kind of freaked me out seeing them in my salad. Seeing the miner's lettuce reminded me of hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains with my daughter's pre-school class whose teacher would pick up various items along the trail for the class to touch or eat....like miner's lettuce. When the charred onion broth was served with Tennessee Ham, an egg yolk, pea-sized apple balls, and scallion, the chef's description of the egg yolk was fascinating. A raw egg yolk is set in 67\u00b0F oil overnight to \"cure\" it. After hot broth is poured over the yolk, you can cut it in half and it still keeps its shape and has lots of flavor. \n\nAfter the starters the saffron lobster was served with rice grits which was very much like risotto made with lobster broth. Interestingly, the chips that accompanied this dish were made from spot prawn roe that were dehydrated, mixed with rice then dehydrated again, then lightly fried. When the grilled squab arrived, I was not only excited about the squab itself, which I hadn't eaten since I was a little girl in Mexico, but it was served with foie gras which was banned (but recently lifted) in CA for several years much to my dismay. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. Mixing things up a bit, the wagyu ribeye arrived with a Thai coconut green curry sauce. Admittedly, the beef wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth as I had hoped, but still the combo was amazing. \n\nEnding the meal with a variety of sweets is my kind of meal. Creatively served with creme anglaise, cream cheese, sparkling water and fennel was an all carrot plate: pressed dried carrot, carrot granita and carrot boba. Following the vegetable dessert was the sticky toffee pudding with a brown butter sorbet, walnut brittle, and sweetened creme fraiche. Rounding out the desserts was a selection of treats: chili rose macaron topped with togarashi, negroni gelee, toasted s'more, a caramel wrapped in edible rice paper and walnut mousse cake.

They start you off with a rum punch which was tasty, and a few appetizers upstairs. I thought the small bites were good, but underwhelming. The apps were a battered egg, foie gras, trout/salmon, fried artichoke chips, and an oyster. Great variety! I was disappointed the slush on the oyster was overpowering and took away from the oyster taste. \n\nAfter the apps, they take you downstairs to sit down in the communal tables. I love the set up and everything was so photogenic. It was really cool to go up to the open kitchen as well to watch them plate the dishes. Service was also spectacular. \n\nNow the food. The food was just not as great as they were describing. There were a few dishes I liked, but I remember one of the chefs explaining the lamb dish and he said it was the best lamb he's ever tasted.

The yolk had such an interesting consistency...almost like fudge.\n\n-Potatoes Fondue- I can't even describe this...cooked potatoes dusted with green herbs with additional vegetables like peas and kale.

I definitely was a little put out by it. \n\nWe got a delicious punch when we first got up there and also got 5 different dishes up there. (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). All of those were delicious. I think my favorite was the scrambled eggs was the most creative (a little bit of spice at the bottom was delicious). The foie gras was probably my favorite overall because I just love foie. \n\nThen we moved downstairs and had: \nMadre's Reviver: OH MY GOD. So delicious of a drink. The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones. None of them were amazing like the first dessert, but they were all really good. (caramel sesame cream puff, frozen smore, sangria jelly, coconut caramel, and black forest macaron.)\n\nThe overall experience was great. The servers were so attentive and always folded the napkins when we left the table. They always served us together as well. So great!\n\nOverall, such a great experience.

When I first heard of this place I thought it was a bit too precious (I'm being honest!).  I saw the reviews from people who all wanted to sit at the end of a table so they would not have to engaged in small talk with strangers.  This was what I call a \"tweezer\" meal and aside from AQ and Nico, I have not been overly impressed or satisfied from those experiences.\n\nI am so happy to admit was was WRONG and worried for nothing!!\n\nThe meal started off with an escorted walk to the upstairs lounge area where five appetizers and a signature cocktail was served.  The seats are pre-assigned per the size of your party.  When food/beverages are delivered they explain the components of each dish.  It's a feast for the eyes, nose and mouth with creative presentations.\n\nWhen it was time for the main meal to begin, a host came by and escorted each party to their seats, which are also pre-assigned at the two communal tables.  My friend and I ended up with seats at the end of the table, closest to the open kitchen.  Several chefs each took turns to speak before each course and inform us of the dish, its ingredients and their origin.  We were also invited to come up to the kitchen and observe the kitchen staff at work.  The wait staff also spent some time with us to speak about the food, wine and restaurant.\n\nI came to this experience with an open mind and just enjoy myself.  Of course one of the dishes served was something I prefer not to eat but they assured us that the lamb was not gamey at all.  It was prepared a bit more rare than I prefer.  I have to say, it was delicious!   All the dishes were unique in terms of taste, texture, presentation and composition.  They used seasonal ingredients that were very fresh.\n\nEveryone eats the same dishes, unless they have made arrangements with the restaurant ahead of time for allergies and dietary restrictions.  Wine pairings are optional.  A booklet is provided to allow for note taking on each dish.  \n\nThere are two seatings, one at 6 pm and one at 8:30 pm.  Your meal is pre-paid, as they want you to end your experience on a high note without having to deal with the bill.  You are encouraged to come earlier than your reservation time to observe the preparations and relax.  For my visit on a Thursday evening, I was able to find parking nearby without any issue but those traveling my Uber/cab were all delayed due to rush hour traffic.\n\nI have never been to a restaurant like this before and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience.

The food is amazing and I will get there in just a minute, but I have to say - thank you to the staff who all acknowledged and congratulated us on our engagement, for the card they all signed which was really the sweetest touch, and for giving us literally the best seats in the house (front nearest the kitchen, and unbeknownst to us, next to the owners of Elizabeth in Chicago - who were the loveliest people and made our experience even greater!). No amount of words could really do this place justice and I'm not sure any other establishment could ever top this one! \n\nThe restaurant is set up for communal dining which is just a fantastic way to meet people and this concept works so well in SF one of the most friendly and progressive cities in the country! Additionally, there is a set menu, which alleviates the need to think/decide what you might want. Everyone enjoys the same food (like a family!) and of course they can accommodate for any food restrictions. We loved all the small bites upstairs before our seating (and the welcome cocktail was seriously addictive, we may have asked for a second..!), and all the dishes after were impeccable. \n\nUpstairs, the grilled foie gras (with blood orange marmalade), and the crab toast were divine and the whipped scrambled eggs was so interesting and delicious!

Shigoku Oyster with preserved winter citrus (4/5) - it's fairly standard fare in SF at the moment. \n(3).

White asparagus with Tsar Nicoulai caviar (4/5) - this dish is good but I've had something similar at Quince not so long ago and that was better.\n(4).  Ham and barley broth with fudgy egg yolk, pink lady apple and charred onion (5/5) - this was the perfect intermezzo and special mention to the consistency and creaminess of the egg yolk. \n(5).  Local halibut with artichoke, stinging nettle, ramps and hollandaise (5/5) - Perfection. No other words to describe it. \n(6).  Grilled rack of lamb with broccolini and kumquat (5/5) - this is, by far, the best piece of lamb I've had and I particularly enjoyed the fat. Surprisingly, the veggies were competing well with the lamb in this dish.  \n(7).  Rhubarb compote with coconut cream and sorrel granita (3/5) - I've had a better version of what this is trying to do at Campton Place (using kiwi instead of rhubarb). \n(8).  Honey with banana and walnut (1/5) - this was not good at all. The banana really overpowered this. A nice chocolate mille-feuille or ice cream/sorbet would have been perfect in this spot. \n(9).  Forager's Tisane Tea (5/5) - really happy with this at the end of the savory courses and while eating the desserts. \n(10).  Mignardises include calamansi lime/Fresno Chile gummi bear, dark chocolate brownie, prickly pear macaron and almond/chocolate/pink peppercorn nugget (5/5) - these are the most unique and tasty small bites I've had in SF and kudos for the creativity. \n\nIn terms of what was missing, I wish they somehow incorporated black truffle in the meal.

Don't seem to have an order that fits my liking.  I like protein and veggie first starch last and from light to rich.

I recommend the earlier seating because the whole experience does take around 2 hours. People in the first seating can go up to the bar around 9:30PM while they start serving the second seating! And also after 9:30PM, the bar is open to everyone from the outside.\n\nWe arrived around 5:15PM, when the doors opened. The hostess showed us around and brought us upstairs where we would have some drinks and snacks. I ordered the Cold Brew Coffee and my boyfriend got the Continental Breakfast.

My Cold Brew Coffee, usually people order it during dessert time, but I heard so many great things about it, I couldn't help it and ordered it right away :D This drink will BLOW your mind, you MUST order it.

If it's a special occasion you are celebrating, they will have a hand written card with everyone's signature! For each dish, someone in the kitchen team will describe what it is, they really want you to eat as they talk, although you can tell everyone looks at each other to see who makes the first bite LOL\n\nHere is what we had in order including appetizers:\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs: Wow, just wow. This shot tasted like a whole breakfast. Mixed with bacon, maple and hot sauce. Mind blowing\nSourdough Dumpling: Very interesting and tasty, caviar on top, mouth watering!\nPreserves: It had oysters, pig's head crepe and ferment greens fritter.

Homemade, it was great!\nDinner Roll: Their signature dinner roll, the butter is made and kept for 5 years now, it was so soft and delicious!\nRadish: It had geoduck clam, cucumber and buttermilk, super refreshing, feels like summer is just around the corner\nArtichoke: It had halibut, blood orange and fennel, fish was cooked just right, also a very summer dish\nPeas: It had dried shellfish and dick ham XO sauce mixed into it. These are the freshest peas I have ever tasted. No words. \nMorels: Topped with a egg yolk that DOES NOT break. Amazing! The mushroom was salty and tasted like a meat\nGuinea Hen: This was one of my least favorites, nothing very special, chicken was very tender tho!\nGrilled Lamb: WOWOWOWOWOW so tender, fatty and juicy. You definitely save the best for last. I was SO mind blown and I'm still thinking about the lamb. It was also topped with gorgeous flowers and garnishes. You get a whole lamb champ, pretty good size. \nStrawberry Dessert: I wasn't too much of a fan, it was kind of TOO simple and too sweet for me\nBlueberry Desserts: Same with this one, too sweet for me.\nLast but not least, they had a platter of desserts that included gummy bears, cinnabon, pineapple bon bon and cake pop.

It wins in taking common ingredients and made delicious meals out of them.\n\n-Snack: overall very well-done and creative. Egg foam with bacon and spicy syrup sauce is their icon and my favorite - Who DOESN'T like any form of eggs and bacon?! I also liked the oyster gel on oyster for creativity. Fried snow crab isn't usually my thing but they pared it well with edible flowers.\n\n-Main course: they really talked up their bread n butter but I didn't think it's anything special. Geoduck with avocado and melon is surprisingly delicious (Geoduck is usually chewy but this one isn't). Salmon with caviar is very fresh. Sweet corn with truffles wasn't a hit; too much truffle it overpowered the corn flavor. The pork ribs were cooked well although can be softer and more flavorful; I didn't care for the crunchy nuts on top of the pork. Lamb chop is definitely a star - roasted, ovened, cooked to perfect tenderness and flavor - it's the best lamb I remember having in the past 10 years.\n\n-Dessert: blueberry tart was good but forgettable. I'm not a fan of the peach ice cream; taste is too creamy and not fruity enough. The peanut butter balls were the highlight of dessert - creative presentation and an explosion of flavors.\n\n-After dessert: one of the best Asian tea list I've seen at a non-Asian restaurant.

It is so intricate with so many small ingredients and techniques used that it blurs the mind. There were probably 7-10 ingredients used Sumac, Chanterelles, blueberries, branches, and infusions.\n\nThe Monterey Abalone, again, was an incredibly complex dish using the liver with brown butter to make an incredible sauce, legumes, cabbage, and mint. Mint was an out of box idea that really worked. Flavors I have never had before.\n\nThe summer squash puree/soup was also just stunning with wonderful unique flavors ( the mussels infusion is pure genius), and wonderful contrasting textures ( beans, crunchy fried squash, and softer Nasturtium textures)\n\nBut there were many  dishes that were so so: Take the corn grits with Australian truffles. The truffles were just awful ( nothing like their brethren in Italy or France). Furthermore the grits were a very one dimensional dish...just mush.\n\nThe lamb dish was very complex sounding but my piece of meat was um...not meaty and basically fatty. Who can taste all of the techniques when there was nothing to really try.\n\nEven the desserts were hit and miss. Our first dish ( Huckleberry with sour cream and rye crumbles) was not sweet, not really texturally appealing.\n\nThe second dessert, White Chocolates, was fantastic. Tiny in appearance but so many subtle things going on...flavor wise and texturally.\n\nWe opted for the wine pairings and they were rather blah...especially for the price. I didn't really feel that many complemented the food they were paired with.\n\nThe biggest complaint from our friends and my wife were that they constantly felt rushed. You see they have two seating's and they have a strict time table to be kept. My friend had trouble keeping up with her wines...and they kept bringing and bringing....who want's to chug their wines? \n\nLastly while there are many dishes the dishes are bite size for the most part. To put it simply...I left hungry.\n\nWhat everyone liked was the atmosphere and the presentation. Service is Stellar here. The chefs explaining each dish was very nice as well. It was lovely to mingle with new friends in a communal spirit.  \n\nBut playing loud 70s-80s music ( which was awesome)  created an atmosphere of diners having to speak louder and louder to the point where one could not hear themselves speak.\n\nIf you want a very unique dinning experience and money is no object this is a very unique and cool place to check out but for a pure food experience I think there are better options in the Bay Area.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Grilled Lamb - ", "This one was pretty basic, but still delicious. ", "A lamb chop covered in aromatic pine leaves that was so tender. "], "author": "Sophie W.", "review": "Truly a one-of-a-kind dining experience. The set-up of the restaurant is designed to be rustic and homey, with a furnished upper area where snacks are served and you're invited to stay as long as you want after dinner. My friend and I arrived a little bit after doors opened, and when we were escorted to the upper level, the seats were mostly full. We had to share a standing table with a nice man who educated us on how expensive the drinks pairing was. It's okay to arrive after doors open; you'll still get to sample all the snacks! We did have to wait a good amount of time for the waiters to actually start serving us snacks, and we waited even longer to get a drink. Communication could've been better because people started heading downstairs of their own volition, and we didn't know if we were supposed to follow or wait for someone to seat us. \n\nSNACKS. Oh, how I'd love to relive those whipped scrambled eggs and shigoku oysters. The eggs were so light and refreshing, with the slight flare provided by the hot sauce. The oysters tasted like the seat. The crispy pole beans were basically tempura-fried beans with fancy sour cream, but they were delicious. Goat cheese tart was well-paired with the fig. Caviar... I honestly don't remember this dish. My taste buds were probably recovering from their fervor. \n\nI love the set-up and the ability to watch the chefs plate the food. The dexterous way they place things really shows you the effort and thought that goes into the dishes. It's almost emotionally painful to eat them because art shouldn't be consumed, only appreciated. We went up a couple times to watch the chefs work and asked them questions. They didn't really give us actual answers (in answer to where the flowers for the dishes came from, one of the chefs said they drove to Golden Gate Park and picked them), but what do I know? \n\nI noted my experience with each dish because they provide a little booklet with all the courses, so I got to feel like a pretentious food critic: \n\nSpelt & Rye Dinner Roll - Could taste the slight sourness in the butter, and it folded perfectly under my knife. When I touched the bread, my fingers just sunk in like it was a beautiful golden cloud. \n\nBeef Tartare with Tomato and Seaweed - Someone apparently hand dove for that seaweed. The tomatoes were unbelievably sweet - why don't they sell this stuff at Safeway? The meat packs a punch with every bite, and the squid ink crisps were a kind of dark saltiness that brought the whole dish together. \n\nAbalone with Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage, Mints - The sauce was Cheetos-flavored. The chef said so himself. I love Cheetos, so I can't complain when it's suddenly okay to eat Cheetos in fine dining. There were brief bursts of flavor from the herbs, which were apparently harvested by some hippie man. They punctuated the chewiness of the abalone. \n\nSummer Squash (cold soup with mussels, beans, nasturtium) - Cold soup done right. The sharp bite of mint and coolness of the squash made me feel like I was inhaling a garden. The mussel is the very special center of the dish, and it's packed with flavor from all the sauces that it got dunked in before being placed into the plate. \n\nFresh Corn Grits - This one wasn't too impressive. I couldn't taste the truffles, and the corn was almost overwhelmingly sweet. \n\nAged Squab with Blueberry, Chanterelle, Sumac - Super rustic. It brings out memories of forests and food cooked in the midst of fires. There's a smokiness contained within the meat. Also, there was an edible twig. Where else can you eat branches and have it be called fine dining? \n\nGrilled Lamb - This one was pretty basic, but still delicious. A lamb chop covered in aromatic pine leaves that was so tender. This one broke the pattern because the pine leaves were unfortunately not edible. \n\nHuckleberry - The transition between main courses and dessert, this one was mostly muted flavors punctuated by the taste of huckleberry. \n\nWhite Chocolate with Laurel, Fennel, Honey, Chamomile - This went really well with the white tea I ordered, and it just brimmed with wildflowers. A little too sweet for me, but I loved the floral-scented cream inside and the drizzle of honey. \n\nTreats: Honey beehive... I'll eat honey up no matter what. This one had that great texture where it's crispy and gives beneath your teeth, but then it clumps up and you can suck on it for a bit to get all the flavor. \n\nOverall, I love the humor of this place and the appreciation for nature that comes through in all its dishes. I wish I didn't feel that treatment of us wasn't the same because we didn't fit into the same class as the other diners. Side note: if you order tea/coffee/any drink they offer at the end of dinner, you will be charged. Enjoy your time at this place and take it slow!

Color and presentation was absolutely beautiful with the bright green colors. Delicious flavors that opened up my taste buds.\n\nHalibut (2nd course) - with crawfish, summer squash, and nasturtium - the halibut is poached sous vide style so it retained a lot of moisture yet flaky and smooth to the tongue. My favorite was the reddish orange crawfish sauce made from the juices of crawfish heads, the flavors were very concentrated. \n\nPorcini (3rd course) - with fudgy yolk, blackberry, and grains - I am a big fan of runny yolk and this yolk, I don't know how they did it, was poached to perfection.\n\nCold Brew Coffee with brown sugar whip - OMG. Just get it. If you're a coffee lover, you will love this one.\n\nI realized I liked most of the seafood because they were all made very well with complex flavors and textures.

Few people seemed to be really gushing about the food, and were just kind of eating their way through the courses.

It was almost a bit too rich, but so full of goodness that I had to eat it all.\n\nArtichoke Dip with Aged Cheddar, Croutons, Lemon:  B\nA bit unrefined.

The greens offered great texture and the sweet pea custard was delicious.  \n\nBroth of Toasted Grains with Egg Yolk Fudge, Porcini, Baby Leaks:  A+++\nThe egg yolk fudge was amazing.  An isolated yolk that was barely cooked.  Covered in a hearty broth, which brought the dish to slightly above room temp.  If you like poached eggs, you'll definitely get a kick out of this dish.

It's very modern decor (Imagine somewhere Eames chairs would fit but with more warmth and character). Everyone had assigned seating which you don't have to find yourself (they bring you there). Our fellow diners were cheerful and we exchanged hellos (but no obligation here to make new friends). They provide you with a small notebook and pencil allowing you to jot down notes about your dishes as the chef describes it or as you eat it. Also between courses you are encouraged to get up, walk around, observe the chefs cooking/plating (from a distance), and even ask them questions!

This was a mouthful of Spring), Charred Onion Broth (Egg yolk and pork fat. The depth of flavor was soul warming). Halibut (One of the chefs gave us their brining ratio and preparation method with sous vide). Rabbit (Served with snails that they raised and had been fed only with basil -- how long does that even take? I swear I tasted the basil). Lamb (on the bone with the right amount of fat). Rhubarb (an icy sorbet). Oats financier (yum. It was served with granola that reminded me of campfires and coffee).  Final Treats (5 different classic pastry chef deserts like a macaron and cream puff). \n\nFINI\n\nFood: There's a story behind every dish. David Barzelay (Owner/Head Chef) is fun and not too polished. He also allows every one of his chefs to express their creativity and lead on a course (including providing a brief intro the dish). \n\nService: Very professional. Each one of their seatings is a carefully choreographed party. The servers were very attentive. The chefs and kitchen staff were fun and friendly. We even took a picture at the end (unknowingly with all the folks having a blast behind us -- I guess we were the serious ones?) \n\nOverall: If you can go, do it.

There are a lot of singles out there that still don't execute perfectly, but to do so many dishes right for so many diners at one time is really quite a feat. \n\nLazy Bear is as good as it is I think primarily because it spices up the traditional dining experience one has in San Francisco. I do think the food here is at a higher quality in both creativity and execution than other restaurants in the area, but it's also cool to be a part of this process that is so SF. You're sitting in this strange giant clean log cabin being presented with dinner theater even though it's not a show in the traditional sense.\n\nPro tip: check out the view from the upstairs mingling area when you're done eating -- it's pretty cool to see how well orchestrated everything is.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["There were a few dishes I liked, but I remember one of the chefs explaining the lamb dish and he said it was the best lamb he's ever tasted.

I went with 3 stars because the experience was cool and thinking of how much effort was put into the food. I definitely think it was a cool experience. People should try it once. But once, is enough. It's more the hype and the cool experience that makes Lazy Bear fun to try. Do people ever go twice?\n\nIt's hard to get tickets, and when the tickets get released, we were scrambling on finding the right time to go within the next month so I was really excited to go. They start you off with a rum punch which was tasty, and a few appetizers upstairs. I thought the small bites were good, but underwhelming. The apps were a battered egg, foie gras, trout/salmon, fried artichoke chips, and an oyster. Great variety! I was disappointed the slush on the oyster was overpowering and took away from the oyster taste. \n\nAfter the apps, they take you downstairs to sit down in the communal tables. I love the set up and everything was so photogenic. It was really cool to go up to the open kitchen as well to watch them plate the dishes. Service was also spectacular. \n\nNow the food. The food was just not as great as they were describing. There were a few dishes I liked, but I remember one of the chefs explaining the lamb dish and he said it was the best lamb he's ever tasted. That definitely cannot be true, and if it is, then I would want to take him to some asian places or even Aziza who makes really great lamb. The rabbit was salty, but tender. I really enjoyed the barley soup broth with an egg yolk inside. That and the desserts were probably my favorite. I also really enjoyed the seaweed bread and cultivated butter that they made themselves. I also REALLY liked their pastry chef's desserts. All of the desserts were fantastic with great hints of something unique and memorable. Actually, the desserts for me, probably should have pushed this review from a 3 to a 4 star.\n\nOther than that, the food was underwhelming especially for the price. I thought they didn't use the right flavors for the dishes, and the halibut and rabbit were super salty.

It's actually quite shocking that I love this place so much, as I am admittedly a quite picky eater. Walking into a restaurant and eating whatever is served to me is not exactly something that I am naturally drawn to.  Lazy Bear has completely opened my mind to the concept of the 15 course tasting menu, and knowing that it's okay to relinquish control of my plate.. when there is such a brilliant chef at the helm!\n\nWhat I love about Lazy Bear is that it is so darn thoughtful. Every single piece of food, on every single plate, on every single course is very well thought out and planned. Each plate is a work of art, so beautifully and carefully plated, typically not looking anything like you expected from the menu description. Every serving is a fun surprise! All of the flavor combinations are truly unique and inspired by what is in season.  I have tried foods here that I have never heard of, always paired with foods that I know, to form a brilliant, delicious, and well balanced bite. Don't come here if you want the same old same old. You might get something called a \"crab cake\" on your menu, but I guarantee you that it won't look or taste like anything you have ever eaten before.\n\nTo add to the amazing food journey led by Chef Barzelay, you have the super cool atmosphere of the restaurant. You start with your first 4 or 5 courses upstairs in the lounge, like you are at a happy hour, with the cocktail du jour, or your own beverage choice. Head on down to one of the two long communal tables and walk up to look directly into the open kitchen. They actually invite you to come up to check them out while they are working! Before every course, one of the chefs gives a detailed description of what you are about to eat. Sometimes we waited to hear what was on our plates (because we couldn't tell from looking at it!) and other times we chose to dig in and try to figure it out before we heard the explanation. Whatever method you choose, it's always an adventure!\n\nHIGHLY recommend eating here for your next special event, with friends (or come alone and make some friends!), or if you REALLY want to impress your date with something extraordinary.  Be prepared to spend about 3 hours at dinner. It's worth every minute!\n\nSpecial note: No need to worry about what you are going to wear. Lazy Bear is indeed highly elevated and fancy food, but the environment is laid back, casual and fun!  (p.s. wear stretchy clothes! ha!)\n\nHere is a partial list of the foods that I just do not eat, but I have eaten AND loved at Lazy Bear:  lamb (cooked), lamb(tartare), sweetbreads, mushrooms, hot sauce, soft shell crab, caviar, black olives,coffee. I literally cannot believe I liked these things.  Unfortunately, I still can't eat them elsewhere because they just do not contain the magic that they did at Lazy Bear!\n\np.s. I have read some of the 1-star reviews here out of morbid curiosity. I can't believe anyone is complaining that the parkerhouse roll and cultured butter should not be considered a course! When you have FIFTEEN courses, they are all small.  But not only that.. THIS roll is a special spelt rye roll that comes to you piping hot out of the oven and is served with their jaw-droppingly delicious cultured butter that they have been maintaining for *years*! That, my friends, is what makes that \"dinner roll\" course so special. Like I said above, you might see \"dinner roll\" on the menu, but it's like nothing you have eaten before. :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-05-30"}, {"excerpts": ["-Grilled lamb: one of the most flavorful piece of meat that I've ever had.

Took one bite and put my spoon down.\n\nThe dinning room itself was beautiful and i really enjoyed the eclectic music choice... I'm pretty sure I heard Danzig at one point in the night. The transition from dish to dish was well timed too, allowing for a very natural flow to dinner.\n\nTHE BAD\nThe drink service was awful.  To the point that we would order multiple drinks just to ensure that our glasses would not go dry for upwards of 30 minutes.  \n\nLett's rewind a little to the beginning of the night. Walk in, check in, and find our way to standing  area overlooking the dinning room. Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait a little more and finally receive the complementary punch and we ask about a drink menu.  And then again we wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait until we finally receive a menu.  About 45 minutes into the night when we order and later finally receive our drinks (appero Normand and a couple glasses of whiskey) and walked straight downstairs to be seated .  We were literally served our drinks after all of our snacks/appetizer dishes were served. \n\nOnce seated we played this whole waiting game all over again.  We tried making the most of the evening and simply started ordering multiple drinks at the same time (had a couple cocktails which were good, and a glass of their kolsh which was bad...like the beer was infected and tasted like corn).  Even our after espresso order was delivered as i took the last bite of the last dessert course.\n\nI will say that we ordered 4 different types of whiskey/scotch and all 4 recommendations were great!  So that's good.\n\nIt basically felt like we were completely ignored because we had not ordered the wine flight.  I'm not a fan of wine flights (specially if the wine flight included champagne...it's just not for me). I'd much rather choose what I am drinking.\n\nWould I go back, possibly.

Although expensive, I definitely think this is something everybody should try at least once. ($300+)\n\nTwo of my awesome bestest foodie friends (Christine, David) who wanted to dine at this restaurant unselfishly purchased a gift certificate for me and my girlfriend. In return I promised to take many photos and write an extensive review on Yelp about my experience, so here it is! \n\nFirst things first, I wanted to note how Lazy Bear does its reservations/seatings. You will have to purchase the tickets via website a month prior to your desired date. They sell out pretty fast. Tickets range from $150-175 per person. It is a set menu and they will accommodate dietary special requests.  If you purchased/received a gift certificate you will have priority and be contacted immediately when tickets go on sale. Parking isn't too difficult to find in this area, and it is also not too far from Bart.\n\nMy dinner reservation for two was at 6PM. Upon arrival, our coats were taken and we were escorted upstairs to the mezzanine area where we sat and ordered alcoholic drinks (not included in the ticket price). You can order pretty much anything as they do have a full bar downstairs. I had requested for a more intimate area for my and my girlfriend as we were celebrating our anniversary. I was seated in sofa fit for two in the corner of the mezzanine and was very pleased they were able give us a secluded intimate area. They served us complimentary refreshments that was very refreshing and flavorful. My girlfriend said it sort of tasted like chinese herbal medicine. It was similar but this was much more refreshing and delicious. Once everybody was settled in the handful of waitresses/waiters started rolling out the appetizers/snacks.\n\n*Note: Lazy Bear serves a different set menu every day (or maybe month?). Below is what I had on 02/05/16. \n\nSNACKS/APPETIZERS (bite sized):\n1) Whipped scrambled eggs - You are eating foam that tastes like bacon and at the bottom of the glass had a spicy sauce that was very delicious.\n2) Shigoku oyster - this was my favorite dish upstairs. It was amazing! They put kiwis in the oysters that I thought really fit well with the oyster. \n3) Beef tartare -  beef on top of a cracker (made out of rice?). The beef just melted in your mouth. It was very flavorful. \n4) Tete de moine - this was a very beautiful dish and there was a flower that tasted like cheese on it. The main component of the dish was some kind of celery mousse. \n\nAfter these dishes we were brought downstairs and seated. In Front of everybody was a warm wet towel, a menu, some caviar, and bread and butter***. The head chef David, welcomed everybody and introduced the dishes in front of us prior to eating. Before each dish is served a different chef would explain each dish. \n\n***I'm going to quote the head chef on the cultured butter they've been working on for 3 years. \"The butter is pretty f***ing delicious\" and yes, the butter was f***ing delicious. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Hands down, best butter I've had. I asked if I can purchase some and she was able to accommodate my requests.\n\nEntres:\n5) Bay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk - I'm not a huge seafood fan, but these were amazing. The scallops were so fresh and tender. It might have been one of my favorite dishes.\n6) Steelhead trout - Again, fresh and tender. It was amazing. \n7) Egg yolk Fudge- Egg yolk fudge, super savory dish. The egg really was fudge like.\n8) Black truffle grits - Most comforting dish. It reminded me of mac and cheese but a lot better. Heavy amounts of black truffle on top.\n9) Squab - Not a big squab fan, but you can tell the meat was incredibly tender and had a nice smokey flavor. It tasted a bit like duck.\n10) Lamb - Very juicy and flavorful. I don't eat lamb regularly, but this was good. \n11) Coconut & Dark Chocolate desserts - The coconut had a very interesting texture. I preferred the dark chocolate. \n12) Small dessert snacks - The snacks were underwhelming. Some had interesting flavors, but the presentation was beautiful. I probably enjoyed the peanut butter & Jelly the most. \n\nLazy Bear was a great experience for me. I really wanted seconds of certain dishes. I think all of them tasted good and all of them had a great deal of thought and consideration in each dish. By presentation alone, you can really appreciate the work they put into making each dish. \nI know you are wondering, \"Will I be full? I'm paying $300+\". Yes, you do get full because they serve you so many dishes.  In addition to that I've tasted and experienced flavors I've never had before. Like I said, it is an culinary experience. There is more to it than just sitting down and eating. \n\nShoutout to the waitress who hooked me up with some of that delicious cultured butter.

The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones.

The broth by itself was delicious as well\n- Halibut: very smooth and delicious dish but I preferred the fish by itself versus as a mix with everything else\n- Rabbit: my least favorite dish of the night as it was a little chewy but the rabbit sausage was amazing\n- Lamb: they kept the fat on the bone and said to try it.  I was a little skeptical but it was amazing.  Super salty and surprisingly great taste\n- Rhubarb: dessert which was one of my favorites.  Complex flavors but excellent.  The chip in there was nice and the pink peppercorn left a refreshing aftertaste\n- Oats: honey cake which was really sweet and good\n- Treats: black forest macaroon, toasted caramel, sangrai jelly (my favorite), frozen smores and sesame cream puff\n\nPros - very unique dining experience with some amazing food\nCons - beverage pairing was good but didn't feel it was worth the cost, bring a jacket because it's cold inside", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-04-02"}, {"excerpts": ["We were served 3 mains: a halibut dish, a rabbit dish, and a lamb dish.

The space is very cool with the room upstairs as well as in the main dining area.  \n\nPassed Appetizers/cocktail hour - The cocktail/reception area is a little bit small.  We were standing in the middle of the room and it was helpful to have tables throughout but hard to settle in.  Out of the 4 appetizers that they passed, I'd say that I LOVED only 1, one was just okay, and 2 were not that great.  The best passed appetizer was certainly the foie gras cracker.   The whipped scrambled eggs with bacon and maple was okay (a little too weird for my wife to enjoy), I believe the other item was a salmon piece which was forgettable and I can't remember the 4th.\n\nFirst course - Delicious.  This was actually my favorite part of the whole meal.  We were served a foccacia situation, a sweet pea situation, and a soup situation and all were delicious.  I was pretty full after the passed apps and the first course.\n\nMain - This is what knocks my experience from a 5 star to a 4 star.  The main course is supposed to be the best part!  We were served 3 mains: a halibut dish, a rabbit dish, and a lamb dish.  The halibut lacked flavor and the vegetables that were served with it didnt feel like an ideal pairing.

Cocktails were varied and delicious, including an apple calvados-based drink.  I think it was called \"Not Far From the Tree\" or something.  There was a gussied-up oyster, which was great, a scrambled egg and bacon shot, which was fantastic, and one or two other nice little bites to get us warmed up.\n\nMeanwhile, it was the last night to take the Jeopardy online quiz, so GF and I showed up a bit early and the staff was terribly accommodating and helpful, letting us both log on to their wifi and take up a corner of the room to nerd out on our laptops (a yearly tradition).  Special thanks to Akeel who helped get us set up.\n\nGF and I took notes on all the sit-down courses, in the handy little notebook the staff handed out.  These consisted primarily of giving each course a band name.  They were as follows:\n\n1. The Salty Heart (seaweed focaccia with salted butter)\n2. Fern Gully Revival (sweet pea custard with mint)\n3. Soup Toast Rebellion (toasted grain broth with egg yolk fudge and porcinis)\n4.

I would have liked to give 3.5 stars but am rounding up here\n\n- Ambiance - the upstairs cocktail room is well laid out with little nooks for groups of people to congregate. The tiny, ultra modern tables are a disaster, though, because there is not enough space for drinks and plates. The decor of the main dining space is lovely with nice decor\n\n- Food - I really liked the food. There is a major focus on creativity, flavors and clearly a lot of effort in even the smallest of ingredients. The consomme dish was lacking but the sweet pea custard, halibut, lamb were delicious. \n\nWine - a tad disappointing. Our party, and the parties around us (some who came for the 5th time) generally agree that the wine pairings are not worth the money and folks should stick to cocktails. The first wine was terrible (lacking in flavor and finish - the server was appalled because apparently it was expensive!!), the second couple of wines were creative, the dessert wines were decent as well. But not worth the $75 wine pairing price tag. Stick to cocktails, folks\n\nService - this is where most of the improvement is needed. The appetizers and dinner service felt rushed, wines were poured with no explanation on what they were and why they paired well with the food. Even though there were probably one service staff for every 2 patrons, one several occasions, we had to wait for requests, or for the one wine server to come discuss the wine by which time the other servers were ready to clear our plates. Also, someone in our party had food preferences (which were disclosed ahead of time) but the servers had to be reminded on multiple occasions regd the preferences. \n\nAll in all, the food is the star, the wine is a poor distant cousin and the service needs more polish.

This won't make much sense but It feels as is they're trying to put SO much emphasis on the food that they end up detracting from the dining experience in the process. Between each course a chef comes out and laboriously explains every detail of the dish - to complete silence from the assembled diners. With a 7 or 8 course menu this meant that conversations barely started before we had to shut up and listen to how a specific foam is made, or how original a particular taste was going to be. Sometimes it's best just to let the food speak for itself and in a set up (communal tables) that is designed to get people 'mingling' the long and frequent interruptions became annoying and a little pretentious after a while. \n\nStill, now Lazy Bear has a home it is getting as much attention as it should - believe the buzz/ hype because this is the best new food in the city since State Bird landed.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["The lamb was the standout dish.

We got to overlook the seating before us finishing up their meal and observe the chefs at work in the open concept kitchen. The scrambled egg shot was tasty with a hint of bacon and a kick of spice at the bottom. We loved the foie gras torchon on a brioche sliver because how could you not now that it's back! The grilled seaweed focaccia was smoky and the butter was perfectly complemented it was just the right amount of salt. The pea custard was a beautiful dish and surprisingly flavorful. We thought the rabbit sausage and loin with snails (apparently fed a basil based diet) was amazing. The lamb was the standout dish. It was moist, rich, savory and accompanied by farro and dates. It just made you warm from the inside out. The boyfriend had no qualms about gnawing every last piece off the bone. Desserts were great. They didn't overwhelm you but were so different.

This makes a lot of sense to me; it'd take way too much effort to source additional ingredients to accommodate a single diner. On the night I dined, they had been laser focused on executing some new dishes and hadn't considered the substitutions as thoroughly. That is also a reasonable explanation and makes sense to me. For those considering dining this month, they've remedied this, so maybe don't let my singular experience dissuade you from writing Lazy Bear off.\n\nOn the whole, I do feel like Lazy Bear is still a well-thought dining experience. You can see it in the ambiance, you can feel it in the way they've set up the communal dining, you can hear it when they introduce each dish. And, I feel that they are (usually) thoughtful about the composition of the food. So, I'm keeping this rating and plan to revisit in the future.\n\n---\n3.25 stars. My review in a word - underwhelming. Also, your money is better spent elsewhere if you don't eat meat. \n\nBefore everybody gets thrown in a tizzy, let me just note that dinner was a fantastic experience and I liked the atmosphere a lot. But, the experience just didn't match up with my (perhaps too high?) expectations. Maybe it was the fact that I requested a pescatarian menu, which cramped the chefs' creative license. Maybe it was the fact that pop-ups and communal dining are no longer a novelty, especially in the Bay Area. But, I really think it was the fact that 2 tickets, 2 drinks, and corkage for 1 bottle ($50) put me out nearly $500. That's like, two fancy dinners at Chez Panisse, but you get about 1/2 of the food. I realize that quantity isn't the end goal here, but the economist in me couldn't help but lament at the opportunity cost. \n\nMy main disappointment was the approach to substitutions. I normally don't eat meat, but I indicated to the chefs that using animal fats/broths would be okay. I figured I should be flexitarian to enjoy the full experience. Usually, constraint breeds creativity but I think in this case Lazy Bear just got lazy. Most restaurants will sub some sort of protein if you're not going to have meat. Not the case at Lazy Bear. \n\nA few examples from our 12-course meal... descriptions are followed by nearly verbatim comments from the server (service is attentive but fairly impersonal):\n- Foie gras, brown rice, some veggies // \"Hi Sherry, so you're getting the same dish, without the foie. Yea?\" Ummm... yeah okay, I mean, what choice do I have? \n- Lamb tartare // \"Hi Sherry, so you've got the same garnish, but we're serving you goat cheese instead of the lamb.\" The cheese was pretty tasty and foamed (a new preparation to me), but \n- Duck & duck sausage // \"Here we have a carrot that has been grilled and charred. And you've still got the quince on the side, yea?\" So people got 2 pieces of meat and quince, but I got a single carrot and quince. \n- Wagyu // \"Okay, same deal - you've got the same dish as the others, except you have no meat and more of the garnish, yea?\" Great, my partner has this fantastically marbled piece of meat and I have an extra piece of eggplant and a few extra baby tomatoes. \n\nEven though I didn't feel like I got a lot of value for my ticket, I do recognize that the kitchen staff are exceptionally talented. That carrot was tender yet substantial; how they avoided making it mushy is beyond me. And they coaxed some amazing flavors out of the starter snacks (my favorite was a Kumamoto oyster on a bed of tomato puree, sprinkled with a touch of tomato leaf oil. Sublime, sweet, subtle). The butter is AMAZING - made from 3-year-old bacteria culture, well-salted, super creamy... the rye and spelt roll was just a convenient excuse for me to inhale that rich butter. \n\nListen, Lazy Bear. Substitutions are fine. But at least make it a true substitution rather than just taking ingredients away. Give me a 1 for 1, not a 1 for 0.

We did the late seating and got to the restaurant about 15 minutes ahead of it. This was a good idea, as you can get a seat. I would even suggest 20-30 minutes ahead of time, as it quickly filled up. The room is very nice room as is the ambience. The decor is nice, but almost tries too hard. The first bite of food didn't come until after 9pm and after 3-4 mouse bouche and almost two hours, we were seated at10:30, they apologized, as it was the 2nd night of a new menu and they had a few problems. As for the drinks, we didn't do wine pairings, as my spouse wasn't drinking, so I order a few cocktails and then went for the wines by the glass, the wines by the glass were not great (no old world, just California, despite having a nice list of Old World wines). That was disappointing for me, but I suspect wouldn't be a problem for other Bay Area natives. I would recommend the wine-pairings if you plan to go. With the long wait time to be sat for the main courses and the small amount of food, there were a few comments from the people around us that they should have eaten more before. Not something you want to hear when you're paying $200 a head. When we did sit down the staff describe every dish to the room, including the bread and butter, which may have been the highlight (outside of the beef). With that said, we were into hour 3 now and as we got into course 6-7, we were frankly thinking to ourselves, hurry up and discussing how we make a graceful exit. The main courses were hit and miss, their take on minestrone, a big miss, the lamb crudo was good, but trout dish, which held up the service very ordinary and both desserts were not worth the wait.

Unfortunately,  you're paying more for the staff and ambience than the food.

Cured carrots made my list, too, as did the caviar \"snack\" on mascarpone-leek custard. \n\nFOOD--The Bad\nFor an 11-or-something course meal, I was astounded to really only have one meat dish. Was the meat dish good? Yes, it was a great lamb chop. But I heard from another friend that on his visit, they served some amazing beef that was even higher grade than kobe. I was surprised not to have a beef course at this sort of event, and relieved not to have brought my husband, who would have been livid. I love vegetables, and all the vegetable courses were outstanding, so well conceived and prepared. Each vegetable was the star of its course, and spring was the theme. But I'm serious: only one meat course? No. Just no. \n\nThe other point I want to focus on is desserts. There were two desserts followed by an ending of petit-fours. The two desserts were truly underwhelming. The first, a rhubarb thing, was simply pleasant. The second had dull flavor and terrible texture (the texture was not an accident; the pastry chef explained that she was going for that... it was inspired by her childhood memories). I simply didn't eat it. It can't be easy to be a pastry chef: you have to be inventive, and that very inventiveness often ruins a course that, when you stick closer to classics, can very well speak for itself. I seriously didn't think the desserts were worth the calorie intake.\n\nSERVICE--The Good\nOur service was spot-on, everything arrived promptly (except my espresso at the end, which I'd hoped to enjoy with my sweets, but came after both dessert courses were collected). Everything else was spotless service-wise. I should note that we had the 6pm seating; I can't speak for how smoothly things run later on at night.\n\nSERVICE--The Bad\nWith so many courses, obviously the portions need to be small. However, with so many courses come SO MANY explanations of the courses. I found that the explanations, while interesting at first, lasted longer than the food. You could be done in three bites and they are still listing the 25 ingredients and 15 techniques that composed those three bites. That many courses coupled with explanations disrupts the conversation you're having too much. \n\nI contrast this with The Kitchen in Sacramento (run by the Selland group). They serve closer to 7 courses, and do a similar schpeal about each, but the explanations are more colorful and engaging, and the food outlasts the yapping. They also don't have communal seating, which is something to note if you're not a fan or if you want a deep, intimate convo with your companion. Their quality is also better. I gave this place here 4 stars so I could give The Kitchen 5 stars. I live near SF, but that place is worth the drive to Sac; if you're into this sort of dining, I'd choose The Kitchen.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-05-04"}, {"excerpts": ["The lamb is truly amazing, but I honestly think my favorite part of the dish was the juice/sauce it came with.

(Here is where I will mention that I am a vegetarian on a day-to-day basis. But I could eat this beef all day, every day. It's that good.) So the food was amazing is what I'm getting at.

Crab toast with cauliflower, lardo and sourdough (5/5) - more please!!!\n\nThe hosts then take diners to seat at one of two huge communal tables downstairs for the rest of the evening.  The chefs introduce each course in the main dining area and courses served downstairs included:\n\n(1). Spelt and Rye Dinner Roll with house cultured butter (5/5) - the bread was fabulous and the butter was even better.  To me, the bread has become a real important part of the fine dining experience and this is probably the second best bread I've had in SF (the brioche at Atelier Crenn is the first).\n(2).  Geoduck clam with sorrels, watermelon radish and oro blanco (3/5) - decent geoduck dish but I was just at Coi and their geoduck dish was better.\n(3).  White asparagus with Tsar Nicoulai caviar (4/5) - this dish is good but I've had something similar at Quince not so long ago and that was better.\n(4).  Ham and barley broth with fudgy egg yolk, pink lady apple and charred onion (5/5) - this was the perfect intermezzo and special mention to the consistency and creaminess of the egg yolk. \n(5).  Local halibut with artichoke, stinging nettle, ramps and hollandaise (5/5) - Perfection. No other words to describe it. \n(6).  Grilled rack of lamb with broccolini and kumquat (5/5) - this is, by far, the best piece of lamb I've had and I particularly enjoyed the fat. Surprisingly, the veggies were competing well with the lamb in this dish.  \n(7).  Rhubarb compote with coconut cream and sorrel granita (3/5) - I've had a better version of what this is trying to do at Campton Place (using kiwi instead of rhubarb). \n(8).  Honey with banana and walnut (1/5) - this was not good at all. The banana really overpowered this. A nice chocolate mille-feuille or ice cream/sorbet would have been perfect in this spot. \n(9).  Forager's Tisane Tea (5/5) - really happy with this at the end of the savory courses and while eating the desserts. \n(10).  Mignardises include calamansi lime/Fresno Chile gummi bear, dark chocolate brownie, prickly pear macaron and almond/chocolate/pink peppercorn nugget (5/5) - these are the most unique and tasty small bites I've had in SF and kudos for the creativity. \n\nIn terms of what was missing, I wish they somehow incorporated black truffle in the meal.

Probably of one the most memorable Michelin star restaurants so far. I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, highly recommend for special occasions, it's definitely a treat! Lazy Bear recently received TWO Michelin stars and I honestly can see why. Their theme is like going to a dinner party. 40 people per seating, one at 6:30PM and the other one is at 8:30PM. I recommend the earlier seating because the whole experience does take around 2 hours. People in the first seating can go up to the bar around 9:30PM while they start serving the second seating! And also after 9:30PM, the bar is open to everyone from the outside.\n\nWe arrived around 5:15PM, when the doors opened. The hostess showed us around and brought us upstairs where we would have some drinks and snacks. I ordered the Cold Brew Coffee and my boyfriend got the Continental Breakfast. OMG the best drinks have ever had, like I'm not even joking! My Cold Brew Coffee, usually people order it during dessert time, but I heard so many great things about it, I couldn't help it and ordered it right away :D This drink will BLOW your mind, you MUST order it. It's a secret recipe and coffee master behind it is associated with Blue Bottle Coffee. Around 5:45PM, they start serving their house made Georgia Punch, very refreshing! The appetizers start coming in around 6PM then they move to to downstairs for the main course. When you get to your seating, you have a little note book and pen where it shows all the dishes and you can write your thoughts! If it's a special occasion you are celebrating, they will have a hand written card with everyone's signature! For each dish, someone in the kitchen team will describe what it is, they really want you to eat as they talk, although you can tell everyone looks at each other to see who makes the first bite LOL\n\nHere is what we had in order including appetizers:\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs: Wow, just wow. This shot tasted like a whole breakfast. Mixed with bacon, maple and hot sauce. Mind blowing\nSourdough Dumpling: Very interesting and tasty, caviar on top, mouth watering!\nPreserves: It had oysters, pig's head crepe and ferment greens fritter. Oysters were delicious, it what I really remembered, it has some kind of gelatin and then a small oyster beneath it.\nCrispy Maitake Mushroom: Crispy and delicious come with their home made onion sour cream, just wow.\nRhubarb Soda: Refreshing! Homemade, it was great!\nDinner Roll: Their signature dinner roll, the butter is made and kept for 5 years now, it was so soft and delicious!\nRadish: It had geoduck clam, cucumber and buttermilk, super refreshing, feels like summer is just around the corner\nArtichoke: It had halibut, blood orange and fennel, fish was cooked just right, also a very summer dish\nPeas: It had dried shellfish and dick ham XO sauce mixed into it. These are the freshest peas I have ever tasted. No words. \nMorels: Topped with a egg yolk that DOES NOT break. Amazing! The mushroom was salty and tasted like a meat\nGuinea Hen: This was one of my least favorites, nothing very special, chicken was very tender tho!\nGrilled Lamb: WOWOWOWOWOW so tender, fatty and juicy. You definitely save the best for last. I was SO mind blown and I'm still thinking about the lamb. It was also topped with gorgeous flowers and garnishes. You get a whole lamb champ, pretty good size. \nStrawberry Dessert: I wasn't too much of a fan, it was kind of TOO simple and too sweet for me\nBlueberry Desserts: Same with this one, too sweet for me.\nLast but not least, they had a platter of desserts that included gummy bears, cinnabon, pineapple bon bon and cake pop. I would say my favorite out of those was cinnabon!\n\nOverall, such an amazing experience. I can understand why this place earned their Michelin stars.

Some of it had to do with my recent taking to Chef's table on Netflix, but this restaurant's tasting menu is amazing. My wife planned this as a surprise for our anniversary and I was blown away as the courses kept coming in.\n\nThe entire experience lasts about 2.5 to 3 hrs. \n\nWhen my wife made the reservations, she specified that we were vegetarians and she didn't have eggs (eggs were ok for me). The staff was really accomodative with the request and as we saw later, none of the dishes were compromised in taste, quality and presentation.\nThe setting is casual and mirrors a picnic theme in the Sierras. Everyone sits together around a picnic table for the main course and are encouraged to chat with each other and the chefs in the kitchen.\n\nBefore the main course, groups \"lounge\" around invidual tables where you are served with drinks and appetizers. We were served with 5 appetizers. I have included pictures of all items for appetizers, main course and desert for your reference.\n- Whipped scrambled eggs 10/10: This was my favorite appetizer and apparently is a \"constant\" for all seasons when you go to lazy bear. For my wife, the eggs were substituted by potatoes. The taste was insane, and the texture frothy. I really wish they could have served more of this.\n- Savory Custard 6/10\n- Grilled celery (smoked) 9/10: I could have never imagined celery can taste this good. \n- Cauliflower + cheese toast on sourdough bread: 8/10\n- Crispy mushroom of the woods with sour cream and Alliums dip 9/10\n\nExcept for the savory custard, all the other appetizers were outstanding.\n\nWe then proceeded to the main hall for the main course:\n- Bread and butter 8/10: The butter is a house made cultured butter that is very savory and tart. It pairs really nicely with the bread and you can ask for as many servings of butter and bread as you desire.\n- Kohlrabi and its roe 6/10: For me, I didn't like the taste of this dish. It felt a bit too bland.\n- Sunflower 9/10: Phenomenal dish. I loved the crunch, the mushroom flavor and the excellent presentation\n- Barley broth with egg yolk 8/10: I really liked this dish, the egg yolk was quite dense and the barley was quite cruncy. The broth was rich and very complex\n- Artichoke chips and black truffle 8.5/10: The artichoke was really creamy and rich and paired well with the hollaindaise sauce.\n- Cheese with barley grain 7.5/10: I rally liked the crispy leaves on this dish. Overall the barley was cheesy, creamy and savory\n- Rhubarb 6/10: This was a cold dish with a sorbet and coconut ice cream. It was sweet and sour.\n- Candy Cap 8/10: This is a special mushroom that was shaped as a donut and is naturally sweet with a maple syrup flavor. Loved it.\n- Treats: These were an assortment of treats at the end.

Delightful. Another star for confirming the one menu swap request I had put in in advance (no lamb/beef). They totally worked around this for us, which was unexpected. I loved the appetizers served upstairs in the lounge area and appreciated the glass of sparkling wine to kick things off:\n-Whipped Scrambled Eggs (with Bacon, Maple, Hot Sauce)\n-House Kosho Oyster\n-King Salmon (with Pickled Green Strawberry)\n-Foie Gras (with Kumquat, Fennel, Brown Butter Brioche)\n-Artichoke Dip (with Aged Cheddar, Artichoke Chips)\n\nThey were all great but I remember my husband really liking an oyster which is a rare thing. The scrambled eggs served in a shot glass were warm and tasty like a soup, and the scrumptious foie gras seemed to be the crowd fav (they just started to let us eat that again).\n\nOnce downstairs, I enjoyed the open kitchen and the chefs who explain each course with a shocking amount of detail (some people found this excessive but I thought it was adorable in a Portlandia sketch kind of way). \n\nI think the one thing that really set our dinner apart was the wine pairing. We love wine and spend a great deal of time drinking :::ahem::: doing wine research, but we don't often do wine pairings with multi-course meals. I have certainly never had a pairing that changed my experience quite so much. With each course we were directed to taste the wine, then taste with the food. Each time, things changed. Everything went together so perfectly. It really added to the experience for me.\n\nThat said, I will now relay for you the courses along with a smattering of my wine-induced notations:\n-Valentine's Bread: Nikki Notes \"Soft Butter=yum.

Gluten good.\" I just remember thinking, damn, this bread and butter is amazing.\n\n-Charred Onion Broth with Country ham, Egg yolk, Apple, Scallion\n\n-Sweet Pea Custard with Cured Steelhead Roe, Pea Shell-Mint Sauce, Spring Onion Nikki Notes \"Wild shoots from forraging! Mint tips you guys!\"\n\n-Hailbut with Asparagus, Lettuce, Meyer Lemon, Brown Butter Hollandaise: Nikki Notes \"Bergamot mmmmm...especially with the wine. Totally changes the flavors.\"\n\n-Rabbit with Snails, Stinging Nettles, Green Garlic: No notes on this one, I was in heaven.\n\n-Lamb with Date, Mustards, Farro, Blood Orange, Olive, Garum: I don't eat lamb and we had notified them of this earlier so I had a crazy delicious duck breast while everyone else had lamb. I totally won this round because while the rest of my party was way too full, the duck breast was on the lighter side and I had plenty of room for dessert. ;)\n\n-Rhubarb with Chamomile, Pink Peppercorn, Tarragon: Nikki Notes \"Killer pallet cleanser after the duck/lamb.

Amazing flavors and even better texture.  Really satisfying.  Wish I had ten more.  \n\nShigoku Oyster and Grapefruit Kosho:  B\nVery ordinary.  Freshness was mediocre.  \n\nKing Salmon with Pickled Green Strawberry:  A+\nSemi ripe strawberry offered perfect acidity.  Salmon was really fatty and cured well.  No qualms here.\n\nFoie Gras with Kumquat, Fennel, and Brown Butter Brioche:  A+\nFoie gras was incredibly rich, and the creaminess was a perfect juxtaposition to the crisp brown butter brioche.  It was almost a bit too rich, but so full of goodness that I had to eat it all.\n\nArtichoke Dip with Aged Cheddar, Croutons, Lemon:  B\nA bit unrefined.  Tasted like something you'd eat at a superbowl party.  Still delicious nonetheless but really didn't offer much continuity with regards to the other dishes.  \n\nYou are then asked to join in the main dining room for the entrees.\n\nGrilled Seaweed Foccacia with House Made Cultured Butter:  A++\nA simple dish, but incredibly well executed.  At the bottom of it, it was just a piece of bread.  However, the kombu flavors were incredibly apparent and the cultured butter was good enough to eat with a spoon.  Execution was absolutely spot on.   \n\nSweet Pea Custard with Steelhead Roe, Pea Shell Mint Sauce, Spring Onion:  A\nRefreshing way to start the meal.  Enough funk from the steelhead roe.  The greens offered great texture and the sweet pea custard was delicious.  \n\nBroth of Toasted Grains with Egg Yolk Fudge, Porcini, Baby Leaks:  A+++\nThe egg yolk fudge was amazing.  An isolated yolk that was barely cooked.  Covered in a hearty broth, which brought the dish to slightly above room temp.  If you like poached eggs, you'll definitely get a kick out of this dish.  Another highlight of the night.  \n\nHalibut with Lettuce, Asparagus, Brown Butter Hollandaise:  A-\nHalibut was cooked perfectly.

Fortunately, my friend scored tickets just as they were released and I was invited to join in on the fun along with Nina Y.. I think the ~$130/pp we paid seems a bit high but think of it as a dinner party experience and delicious food. We went on a Tuesday night for the first seating. We all work in the city and barted to that direction so it was pretty easy. Might be a challenge looking for parking though. \n\nPRELUDE: Front\n\nCheck in at the door. Give your name. Someone will escort you upstairs (and note: they won't forget your name)\n\nSCENE I: The upstairs gathering\n\nI recommend getting to the event early especially if you're the first seating. You definitely want to get some of the limited seating/table area upstairs if you want to be able to set plates/drinks down or, if you're a yelper like me, to get good lighting to take pictures as it is very dim. We were served five amuse bouches (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). They were little interesting bites. I actually liked the whipped scrambled eggs a lot in their simplicity of ingredients but complexity of texture! Also, as I was allergic to cucumber (p.s. they are great about food allergies) they allowed me to substitute the punch of a glass of champagne.\n\nSCENE II: Downstairs\n\nCan my dining room look like this? It's very modern decor (Imagine somewhere Eames chairs would fit but with more warmth and character). Everyone had assigned seating which you don't have to find yourself (they bring you there). Our fellow diners were cheerful and we exchanged hellos (but no obligation here to make new friends). They provide you with a small notebook and pencil allowing you to jot down notes about your dishes as the chef describes it or as you eat it. Also between courses you are encouraged to get up, walk around, observe the chefs cooking/plating (from a distance), and even ask them questions! It's an open kitchen.\n\nList of Dishes (I'll just say everything is amazing and highlight any fun facts):  Valentine's bread, \nSweet Pea Custard (This had salmon roe, I mentally told myself it wouldn't work, but it did. This was a mouthful of Spring), Charred Onion Broth (Egg yolk and pork fat. The depth of flavor was soul warming). Halibut (One of the chefs gave us their brining ratio and preparation method with sous vide). Rabbit (Served with snails that they raised and had been fed only with basil -- how long does that even take? I swear I tasted the basil). Lamb (on the bone with the right amount of fat). Rhubarb (an icy sorbet). Oats financier (yum. It was served with granola that reminded me of campfires and coffee).  Final Treats (5 different classic pastry chef deserts like a macaron and cream puff). \n\nFINI\n\nFood: There's a story behind every dish. David Barzelay (Owner/Head Chef) is fun and not too polished. He also allows every one of his chefs to express their creativity and lead on a course (including providing a brief intro the dish). \n\nService: Very professional. Each one of their seatings is a carefully choreographed party. The servers were very attentive. The chefs and kitchen staff were fun and friendly. We even took a picture at the end (unknowingly with all the folks having a blast behind us -- I guess we were the serious ones?) \n\nOverall: If you can go, do it. I'm not sure if its worth the premium to have it on a weekend night (what are you doing for 2-3 hours on a weekday night anyway?) as they serve the same food throughout.

I definitely was a little put out by it. \n\nWe got a delicious punch when we first got up there and also got 5 different dishes up there.

The foie gras was probably my favorite overall because I just love foie. \n\nThen we moved downstairs and had: \nMadre's Reviver: OH MY GOD. So delicious of a drink. The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious.

Some we loved better than others, but that's to be expected. Those are subjective tastes. My personal favorite was the morel dish with the fudge-consistency egg yolk. Cured carrots made my list, too, as did the caviar \"snack\" on mascarpone-leek custard. \n\nFOOD--The Bad\nFor an 11-or-something course meal, I was astounded to really only have one meat dish. Was the meat dish good? Yes, it was a great lamb chop. But I heard from another friend that on his visit, they served some amazing beef that was even higher grade than kobe. I was surprised not to have a beef course at this sort of event, and relieved not to have brought my husband, who would have been livid. I love vegetables, and all the vegetable courses were outstanding, so well conceived and prepared. Each vegetable was the star of its course, and spring was the theme. But I'm serious: only one meat course? No. Just no. \n\nThe other point I want to focus on is desserts. There were two desserts followed by an ending of petit-fours. The two desserts were truly underwhelming. The first, a rhubarb thing, was simply pleasant. The second had dull flavor and terrible texture (the texture was not an accident; the pastry chef explained that she was going for that... it was inspired by her childhood memories). I simply didn't eat it. It can't be easy to be a pastry chef: you have to be inventive, and that very inventiveness often ruins a course that, when you stick closer to classics, can very well speak for itself. I seriously didn't think the desserts were worth the calorie intake.\n\nSERVICE--The Good\nOur service was spot-on, everything arrived promptly (except my espresso at the end, which I'd hoped to enjoy with my sweets, but came after both dessert courses were collected). Everything else was spotless service-wise. I should note that we had the 6pm seating; I can't speak for how smoothly things run later on at night.\n\nSERVICE--The Bad\nWith so many courses, obviously the portions need to be small. However, with so many courses come SO MANY explanations of the courses. I found that the explanations, while interesting at first, lasted longer than the food. You could be done in three bites and they are still listing the 25 ingredients and 15 techniques that composed those three bites. That many courses coupled with explanations disrupts the conversation you're having too much. \n\nI contrast this with The Kitchen in Sacramento (run by the Selland group). They serve closer to 7 courses, and do a similar schpeal about each, but the explanations are more colorful and engaging, and the food outlasts the yapping. They also don't have communal seating, which is something to note if you're not a fan or if you want a deep, intimate convo with your companion. Their quality is also better. I gave this place here 4 stars so I could give The Kitchen 5 stars. I live near SF, but that place is worth the drive to Sac; if you're into this sort of dining, I'd choose The Kitchen.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-05-04"}, {"excerpts": ["For dessert, we had two dishes: a rhubarb dish (which I didn't finish, because I really dislike rhubarbs, but that's all on me) and a \"cereal\" dish (which was basically grains/oats that were deliciously prepared with a scoop of ice cream). \n\n"], "author": "Shannon B.", "review": "My meal at Lazy Bear was the second best dining experience of my life (second only to the French Laundry).

We had a morel mushroom dish, which had morels, romaine lettuce, peas, and a perfectly prepared sixty seven degree egg yolk.  We also had the world's most amazing halibut dish (the halibut was poached in smoked butter).  The lamb is truly amazing, but I honestly think my favorite part of the dish was the juice/sauce it came with.  We were treated to an asparagus dish, which somehow managed to surprise me.  I love asparagus, but this was the most amazing texture.  We had a carrot dish, which was basically carrots, bacon, maple, and bourbon tastes (who's going to complain about that).  We had an artichoke dish, which wasn't my favorite, but that was more so because it was a two or three bite portion and we didn't have knives...so I wound up shoving the whole thing in my mouth, because you really needed a knife to cut it.  For dessert, we had two dishes: a rhubarb dish (which I didn't finish, because I really dislike rhubarbs, but that's all on me) and a \"cereal\" dish (which was basically grains/oats that were deliciously prepared with a scoop of ice cream). \n\nService was pretty spot on.

This place is AMAZING. I dined here with a group of 4 on a Wednesday night.\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE:\nWhen we first arrived we were kindly escorted upstairs to the mezzanine level overlooking the dining room to get checked in. We were promptly shown to a standing table where we would enjoy some small bites, and a complimentary cocktail (which was delish by the way) before our dinner service. We hung here for about an hour, I think...until we were escorted downstairs to the main dining tables. 2 long tables, 42 seats in the room. A community dining experience. SO FUN! As we were shaking hands and meeting our dining neighbors, we were quieted by the executive chef to explain the expectations for the reminder of the evening. We would have courses brought out and someone from the kitchen would interrupt to tell us about the dish! We were encouraged to begin eating while they spoke so that we could enjoy the \"hot foods hot, and cold foods cold, as intended.\" We were also encouraged to chat with our neighbors throughout the evening, as well as to come right up and chat with the chefs at their prep stations in the kitchen! \"Ask questions, come say hi, Each course was beautiful, delicious, unique, and truly a work of art. \n\nTHE SERVICE: \nWe received exceptional service on all fronts. From the GM, Greg, saying hello while we had our snacks, to the various members of the kitchen staff bringing out each dish, our experience was impeccable. Our glasses were never empty, and by the end, our stomachs very full.\n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe 5 small bites, or \"snacks\" as they called them, were each intricately crafted, beautifully presented, and so unique! The first was a whipped scrambled egg, served right inside the egg shell, with a touch of bacon, maple, and hot sauce. The next was an oyster that had a tomato foam on top...very nice. Next was a liver pate served atop a bite of heavenly cornbread. Next, some type of cracker topped with goat cheese and mint ! And, finally, a few bites of what I can best describe as Nashville-hot-chicken-style chicken nuggets served with some house-trained ranch and pickles! Soooo good! \n\nThe dinner service included some fresh rolls and butter, along with 7 courses. The butter they serve is actually house-made and has been filtered to perfection over the last few years. It was very salty, a little sweet, and gave a nice fatty zip to each bite of the dinner roll. \n\nEach entree was amazing and beautiful in it's own way. Here are my favorites in descending order:\n1) Coal roasted beef ribeye with wild peppercorn, smoked potatoes, creamed spinach, and roasted mushroom.\n2) King coast salmon with fennel, peach, dried scallop, and fish eggs! \n3) salmon belly w/ BBQ sauce \n4) grilled summer squash soup with huge chunks of fresh lobster, with saffron, lemon, and basil, all topped with a bit of foam (made from the lobster she'll I think??)\n5) Crispy dry-aged squab (poultry) served with beets, onions, and figs.\n6) Cucumber, tomato, and anchovy with a green sauce, something with doll I think? Omg this was sooooo good! A cucumber salad like no other! And that sauce/puree? I can't remember what it was but man... delicious!\n7) Shelling beans, country ham broth, cranberry miso, and shishito peppers. This was definitely my least favorite thing of the whole experience, but that's just because I'm not a huge fan of the texture of pinto/black beans, which is similar to the texture of these.\n\nDESSERT: \nThere were three waves of sweets to end our evening. \nThe first was a peach dessert...it was kind of like 2 tbsps of the best peach cobbler you've ever had inside of a white chocolate shell, and it was served on top of a graham cracker crust. \nNext was a Raspberry cake with fresh raspberry, raspberry gelato, dark chocolate, and spicy mole sauce. I preferred the peach one but this was still super good! \n\nFinally we were brought a plate with 4 different \"treats\", little bite-sized finishers. My favorites:\n1) White chocolate and cream cheese macaron\n2) Fig and maple donut bite? I can't remember what they called it...it was a much fancier name \n3) Earth bonbon, chocolatey and delicious!\n4) blackberry gummy bear (this was my least favorite, but still a tasty bite).\n\nOVERALL:\nObviously this place isn't cheap..tickets are $250 per person which includes one complimentary cocktail during the snack hour, all of your food, and gratuity. You pay for everything at the time of reservation, except for wine/cocktails/coffee/etc - you will have a separate bill at the end of your meal for any of those items you choose to order, so just be prepared for that.

For the first 30-40 min, you start out upstairs. When you walk in, they give you some mulled wine to warm you up. (*=favorites)\n\nSome of my favorite dishes were from the \"Snacks\" we had upstairs.\n1. *Whipped scrambled eggs: a sous vided egg, whipped so it's light and airy, served in a small tall glass. The bacon made it smoky, and their house hot sauce and the maple syrup at the bottom made it an awesome breakfast like dish.\n2. Kumamoto oyster: with granny smith apple froth and fennel pollen \n3. Caviar: with a smoky sourdough puree and a sourdough crisp. I love caviar\n4. Duck liver mousse: on a graham cracker with cranberries, herbs; I liked the graham cracker\n5. Sea buckthorn soda: They juiced it and made a syrup from the musk, with foam on top. Unique, but I didn't love it \n\nDownstairs: seating at long tables\n1. *Toasted brassica infused broth: the broth was very light and clean, and there were pieces of cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, pickled turnips, fried kale \n2. Spelt and rye dinner roll: their version of a Parker house roll with spelt and rye for nuttiness, topped with brown butter salt. I love salt. Their house cultured butter uses buttermilk with cultures carried forward for 3 years now. It was cheesy and tangy\n3. *Bay scallop: from New England, served raw.  The shell held a satsuma and pine oil citronette that you pour over the dish. It was topped with pine tips, fresh mandarin oranges, partially dehydrated mandarin orders, succulents, buddha's hand, and a meyer lemon zest.  The pine and buttermilk panna cotta underneath was really smooth. I never thought pine could go into a dish, but this one balanced a lot of random ingredients together really well\n4. *Sunchoke: all the parts of a sunflower. There was a sunchoke puree with cheese, sunflower petals, sunflower sprouts, and sunflower seeds. the jus was made of sunchoke and chicken.  The stand out was actually the sweetbreads (sauteed in butter, garlic, lemon juice, fried). The texture and flavor were really good. The egg yolk confit was more like a fudge texture than runny. It was a very creative and interesting dish\n5. *Butterball potatoes: potatoes that were only 2 weeks old, super tender, almost like gnocchi?, super sweet and creamy. It came with green garlic, stinging nettles, chantarelles, crispy seaweed, crispy nettles. On the bottom was a German butterball potato-sea lettuce-nettle puree. I didn't know I could enjoy potatoes so much\n6. Sonoma county duck: a sausage made from the legs and wrapped in collard greens (good flavor), quince roasted in duck fat (with cinnamon, black pepper, ginger), and the duck breast. The breast is aged in house for 7 days, so it ferments and tastes almost like ham.\n7. Pork belly: from Sonoma. Brined for 24 hours, braised for 40 hours to tenderize it, and they did a good job of rendering out the fat.  It came with fresh and smoked beet juice with apple cider and a green apple + onion soubise. Various sorrels (wood, French, red vein) and mustard greens added earthiness. The smoked beets were also really good with the pork belly\n8. Hazelnut: coffee ice cream with candied meyer lemon peel (loved this lemon peel with the hazelnut and coffee). It also had a brown rice pudding cooked in toasted hazelnut milk, cocoa crisps, hazelnut coffee, and a brown butter puree. This was a pretty interesting take on hazelnut (ie not just hazelnut and chocolate)\n9. Persimmon: Hachiya semifreddo (I prefer ice cream), salt roasted fuyu (encased in salt and compressed, pretty salty), pickled persimmon puree. Then there was a malted sponge cake (subtle). The root beer pudding w/malted milk and tempered chocolate tasted like a whopper!\n\nFinal Treats: \n1. *Vietnamese coffee: frozen vietnamese coffee covered in white chocolate and on top of a chocolate cookie \n2. Chocolate bonbon: with pine and yuzu, topped with fleur de sel. I liked the yuzu and how they rounded out the meal with more pine\n3. Macaron: a half macaron with cayenne, cinnamon pear, caramel\n\nOf the wine pairings, the most interesting ones were the blanc de blanc, the Nebbiolo, the pinot, and the sparkling tokaji at the end. Our sommelier told us a lot of interesting stuff behind each of the wines. We also tried some cocktails (they have a full liquor license now.)\n\nI love the open kitchen, and you're allowed to go over and look and talk to the chefs.  They encourage you to talk to the people sitting next to you, but it wasn't as communal as I thought it would be (I don't love communal dining).

I dined here with a group of 4 on a Wednesday night.\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE:\nWhen we first arrived we were kindly escorted upstairs to the mezzanine level overlooking the dining room to get checked in. We were promptly shown to a standing table where we would enjoy some small bites, and a complimentary cocktail (which was delish by the way) before our dinner service. We hung here for about an hour, I think...until we were escorted downstairs to the main dining tables. 2 long tables, 42 seats in the room. A community dining experience. SO FUN! As we were shaking hands and meeting our dining neighbors, we were quieted by the executive chef to explain the expectations for the reminder of the evening. We would have courses brought out and someone from the kitchen would interrupt to tell us about the dish! We were encouraged to begin eating while they spoke so that we could enjoy the \"hot foods hot, and cold foods cold, as intended.\" We were also encouraged to chat with our neighbors throughout the evening, as well as to come right up and chat with the chefs at their prep stations in the kitchen! \"Ask questions, come say hi, Each course was beautiful, delicious, unique, and truly a work of art. \n\nTHE SERVICE: \nWe received exceptional service on all fronts. From the GM, Greg, saying hello while we had our snacks, to the various members of the kitchen staff bringing out each dish, our experience was impeccable. Our glasses were never empty, and by the end, our stomachs very full.\n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe 5 small bites, or \"snacks\" as they called them, were each intricately crafted, beautifully presented, and so unique! The first was a whipped scrambled egg, served right inside the egg shell, with a touch of bacon, maple, and hot sauce. The next was an oyster that had a tomato foam on top...very nice. Next was a liver pate served atop a bite of heavenly cornbread. Next, some type of cracker topped with goat cheese and mint ! And, finally, a few bites of what I can best describe as Nashville-hot-chicken-style chicken nuggets served with some house-trained ranch and pickles! Soooo good! \n\nThe dinner service included some fresh rolls and butter, along with 7 courses. The butter they serve is actually house-made and has been filtered to perfection over the last few years. It was very salty, a little sweet, and gave a nice fatty zip to each bite of the dinner roll. \n\nEach entree was amazing and beautiful in it's own way. Here are my favorites in descending order:\n1) Coal roasted beef ribeye with wild peppercorn, smoked potatoes, creamed spinach, and roasted mushroom.\n2) King coast salmon with fennel, peach, dried scallop, and fish eggs! \n3) salmon belly w/ BBQ sauce \n4) grilled summer squash soup with huge chunks of fresh lobster, with saffron, lemon, and basil, all topped with a bit of foam (made from the lobster she'll I think??)\n5) Crispy dry-aged squab (poultry) served with beets, onions, and figs.\n6) Cucumber, tomato, and anchovy with a green sauce, something with doll I think? Omg this was sooooo good! A cucumber salad like no other! And that sauce/puree? I can't remember what it was but man... delicious!\n7) Shelling beans, country ham broth, cranberry miso, and shishito peppers. This was definitely my least favorite thing of the whole experience, but that's just because I'm not a huge fan of the texture of pinto/black beans, which is similar to the texture of these.\n\nDESSERT: \nThere were three waves of sweets to end our evening. \nThe first was a peach dessert...it was kind of like 2 tbsps of the best peach cobbler you've ever had inside of a white chocolate shell, and it was served on top of a graham cracker crust. \nNext was a Raspberry cake with fresh raspberry, raspberry gelato, dark chocolate, and spicy mole sauce. I preferred the peach one but this was still super good! \n\nFinally we were brought a plate with 4 different \"treats\", little bite-sized finishers. My favorites:\n1) White chocolate and cream cheese macaron\n2) Fig and maple donut bite? I can't remember what they called it...it was a much fancier name \n3) Earth bonbon, chocolatey and delicious!\n4) blackberry gummy bear (this was my least favorite, but still a tasty bite).\n\nOVERALL:\nObviously this place isn't cheap..tickets are $250 per person which includes one complimentary cocktail during the snack hour, all of your food, and gratuity. You pay for everything at the time of reservation, except for wine/cocktails/coffee/etc - you will have a separate bill at the end of your meal for any of those items you choose to order, so just be prepared for that.

"], "author": "Christine Y.", "review": "As magical as it was back in 2011 when they were still a pop up restaurant.\n\nI have a very fond spot for Lazy Bear: I first found them in 2011 when they were still functioning as a pop up in various venues. When I heard they'd opened a storefront, I cheered on the inside. Then came the first Michelin star. Then the second. Now, 7 years later, I was practically salivating in anticipation of finally visiting them again, but I wasn't sure what to expect. Had they lost the magic and enthusiasm of back when they were a pop up working out of random warehouses?\n\nThe answer is emphatically no. I have had the privilege of dining at several Michelin star restaurants in California (Meadowood, Manresa, The French Laundry, Sushi Yoshizumi...), and they are mostly excellent, fine dining experiences. Lazy Bear is that and more. When my friend and I arrived, we were enthusiastically greeted by the bartender, who escorted us upstairs to their waiting area. We were shown to a cozy nook over the balcony, giving us a birds eye view of the dining that was still going on below. Our server was pleasant and helpful with picking out cocktails, and suggested amazing, unique cocktails unlike anything I've ever had before. This was followed by \"fruit punch,\" which was supposed to be alcoholic but didn't taste like it at all (so dangerous!), and a whole slew of \"snack,\" including whipped scrambled eggs, geoduck clam, crispy big head, crab toast, and crispy hen of the woods. After this very pleasant opener, we were then escorted downstairs where we were served spelt and rye dinner roll (complete with their own housemade butter, with their own culture they are clearly very proud of), Mt. Lassen trout and roe, sunflower (which was sunchoke, sourdough, and caviar), ham & barley broth, San Francisco coast halibut, and aged duck. After that came the dessert course: Meyer lemon (with buttermilk and pine), candy cap (maple and cranberry), and a platter of delightful treats (gummy bear, macaron, banana bread, and peanut butter pebble). We also paired this with their reserve wine pairing. I have only had one other wine pairing (at Manresa), but Lazy Bear's was even better than Manresa's. Each wine was smooth and perfectly matched the course; highlights were their champagne and assyrtiko.\n\nEach course was so well done and delicious, but the standout for me is the whole Lazy Bear experience. The tables are giant communal tables to encourage the \"dinner party\" feel, which is just how their pop up functioned. The kitchen is right there for you to watch all the chefs hard at work, and David Barzelay (rearrange the letters of his last name to get \"Lazy Bear\") himself will announce some of the courses as well as help serve guests. Everyone is friendly and enthusiastic about their work, and guests are encouraged to walk up to the kitchen to observe them at work. They also thoughtfully provided swivel chairs, so you can pivot to hear them announce the courses, as well as chat with your neighbors. And since I was there celebrating my birthday, I was also presented with a birthday card, signed by all the staff.\n\nIn summary, I absolutely loved the entire experience, and I really appreciated how, despite their increased profile (PBS was there filming a special), they have maintained their friendly, approachable, but still extremely fine dining experience.

I love how the chef encourages guests to interact with each other, as well as the staff preparing the food in the open kitchen right in front of the communal dining tables. It's also fun and spruces up the meal when we first sit in the balcony for cocktails hour and then downstairs for the main courses/dessert.\n\nThe dishes change depending on what's in season and what ingredients they have. Apparently we were super lucky and had only a 1 time shipment of trout roe so we had a cool appetizer dish with that. The food is AMAZING and there wasn't a dish I didn't like... Everyone, including myself, was smiling after every bite! There was so much energy in the air and it's not like any snooty 2-star michelin starred restaurant. I love it.\n\nAnd you know when a restaurant is good when you eat an entire dish made out of ingredients you don't like. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but I ate that whole thing. They added a bunch of refreshing herbs and butternut squash puree that totally countered the gamey-ness. \n\nI was a little disappointed in the desserts though since they tasted super tart to me. The desserts featured a lot of berries/cherries so those were dishes that I didn't fully finish. however, I did love the small treats like the gummy bears, mini cinnabons, and red velvet cake pop.\n\nService was excellent and so fun and interactive! When we bought tickets, we wrote it was our friendiversary so they greeted us with a \"happy friendiversary!\" and a nice card signed by the staff. BTW, we weren't lying because technically I started hanging out w/ my fiance's friends during memorial day weekend last year :)\n\nFYI if you dine earlier in the week, it is cheaper.

It's tight quarters up there, but we were early enough to snag seats.  We had the second seating for the night so there was a little preview of what was to come looking down at the dining room from above.

The oyster with gelee and whipped eggs were my faves and made me even more excited about what was to come.\n\nOne by one, our parties were escorted downstairs to the main dining room and seated at the two long tables.

My wife planned this as a surprise for our anniversary and I was blown away as the courses kept coming in.\n\nThe entire experience lasts about 2.5 to 3 hrs. \n\nWhen my wife made the reservations, she specified that we were vegetarians and she didn't have eggs (eggs were ok for me). The staff was really accomodative with the request and as we saw later, none of the dishes were compromised in taste, quality and presentation.\nThe setting is casual and mirrors a picnic theme in the Sierras. Everyone sits together around a picnic table for the main course and are encouraged to chat with each other and the chefs in the kitchen.\n\nBefore the main course, groups \"lounge\" around invidual tables where you are served with drinks and appetizers. We were served with 5 appetizers. I have included pictures of all items for appetizers, main course and desert for your reference.\n- Whipped scrambled eggs 10/10: This was my favorite appetizer and apparently is a \"constant\" for all seasons when you go to lazy bear. For my wife, the eggs were substituted by potatoes. The taste was insane, and the texture frothy. I really wish they could have served more of this.\n- Savory Custard 6/10\n- Grilled celery (smoked) 9/10: I could have never imagined celery can taste this good. \n- Cauliflower + cheese toast on sourdough bread: 8/10\n- Crispy mushroom of the woods with sour cream and Alliums dip 9/10\n\nExcept for the savory custard, all the other appetizers were outstanding.\n\nWe then proceeded to the main hall for the main course:\n- Bread and butter 8/10: The butter is a house made cultured butter that is very savory and tart. It pairs really nicely with the bread and you can ask for as many servings of butter and bread as you desire.\n- Kohlrabi and its roe 6/10: For me, I didn't like the taste of this dish. It felt a bit too bland.\n- Sunflower 9/10: Phenomenal dish. I loved the crunch, the mushroom flavor and the excellent presentation\n- Barley broth with egg yolk 8/10: I really liked this dish, the egg yolk was quite dense and the barley was quite cruncy. The broth was rich and very complex\n- Artichoke chips and black truffle 8.5/10: The artichoke was really creamy and rich and paired well with the hollaindaise sauce.\n- Cheese with barley grain 7.5/10: I rally liked the crispy leaves on this dish. Overall the barley was cheesy, creamy and savory\n- Rhubarb 6/10: This was a cold dish with a sorbet and coconut ice cream. It was sweet and sour.\n- Candy Cap 8/10: This is a special mushroom that was shaped as a donut and is naturally sweet with a maple syrup flavor.

Three years later, it was my birthday, and I returned to find a Michelin-starred restaurant set up like the dinner party I always wanted to host only I didn't know anybody except Jamie W., of course. I have to admit I still giggle at the name and feel a need to explain that it's not a bear-trapping event on the Russian River but a real restaurant with silverware and synchronized servers. There are two seatings at their two long communal tables each evening, 6PM and 8:30PM, and oh yes, you pay in advance, $160 per person plus a 20% service charge.\n\nReservations need to be made in advance, a month in my case, in order to secure spaces, and for heaven's sake, don't be late because the purveyors warn you that if you arrive a half-hour late, you will have missed four courses. Period. Full stop. the door opens at 5:15PM, so I made sure I left work early and also pushed Jamie to skedaddle from his office. We ended up being the first ones there, and we were swept upstairs to the loft on a semi-private couch right below a twenty-year-old photo of Tom Selleck. We were immediately served a couple of Plum-Infused Pomegranate Punches in cut-glass cups like we were at a junior prom circa 1956 (photo: http://bit.ly/2dagfIJ).\n\nI was surprised we didn't get white gloves to pick them up properly. In need of something stiffer, I ordered the smoky and luscious $15 Basil Martini with Basil-Infused Mezcal, Dry Gin, Apple Mint Vermouth, and droplets of Basil Oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2dagEuN). Jamie curbed his enthusiasm by having a $3 bottle of Mexican cola called Jarritos. Thoroughly imbibed, we received our first course, the bottoms-up Whipped Scrambled Eggs served cocktail-style with Bacon, Maple Syrup, and Hot Sauce like a hangover breakfast (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUfF4p). Yummy. Next came a Brown Rice Chip with Channel Islands Halibut, Jimmy Nardello Pepper, and Sudachi decoratively placed on it (photo: http://bit.ly/2daf0ZP).\n\nThis was another lovely bite followed by a Broiled Shigoku Oyster with Nasturtium Gla\u00e7age and Lardo which I slurped with gusto (photo: http://bit.ly/2dHvaJn). The tempura-like Crispy Pole Beans arrived right after with a Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Allum Dip (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUftCd). This was capped off by a fizzy, fermented Cape Gooseberry Soda replete with a candy-stripe straw (photo:  http://bit.ly/2dlSFpP). This flurry of upstairs activity finally segued to the downstairs where chef David Barzelay explained the concept behind Lazy Bear and had the sous chefs explain each of the courses we were about to dive into (photo: http://bit.ly/2dBCnep).\n\nThe first was simply a fabulous Dinner Roll made of Spelt & Rye with a huge slab of fresh butter (photo: http://bit.ly/2dzp1QW). It so reminded me of the ones I got from Mrs Crabtree in her hairnet at the school cafeteria. This was followed by a regally meltable Beef Tartare with Tomatoes and Seaweed as garnish (photo: http://bit.ly/2dCZd5R). The soup course came next with a creamy Cucumber Vichysoisse with Stugeon, Leek, Potato and bursts of delight from the Caviar (photo: http://bit.ly/2dzqhUd). We started moving into the proteins with the seafaring tastiness of the Monterey Abalone accompanied by Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage and Mint in a faux-abalone shell (photo: http://bit.ly/2cYuu4U).\n\nThe Aged Squab was as rich as duck as it sat amid Huckleberries, Chanterelle and Sumac (photo: http://bit.ly/2dyPsZp). The high point came unsurprisingly in the rich and tender Wagyu Ribeye straight from Japan with Sunflower, Sunchoke, and Brassicas (photo: http://bit.ly/2dFJkuw). A palate cleanser came with the Cucumber Granita with a tiny cheesecake hidden underneath flavored with Lemon Verbena and Oats (photo: http://bit.ly/2d0dZAA).

You start off the evening mingling with other guests over snacks in the second floor. Once dinner is ready, everybody descends to the dining hall, where they are seated across 2 long communal tables that fit around 20 each. For my fellow Potterheads out there, think the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Throughout the meal, folks are encouraged to get up, roam around the restaurant, take pictures of the open kitchen, jot down remarks on their notebooks, engage in conversation with their neighbors, and ask the staff any questions they might have. It's a 2-hour ordeal that I guarantee you won't get anywhere else.\n\nMy favorite dishes of the night were the whipped scrambled eggs, dinner roll, red kuri squash, and black twig apple. Surprisingly, the one dish that I thought needed improvement was the wagyu ribeye. Its marbling was unevenly distributed, which caused some bites to taste fattier than others. The beef also lacked the succulent flavor and buttery tenderness that I was expecting.\n\nAnother qualm was that I found it difficult to savor every single bite like I'm accustomed to. In any given fine dining setting, I'm usually the person with the largest appetite but the slowest eating pace. This didn't bode well for me here, since the servers were already handing out subsequent courses as I was still nibbling away. Because of this, the experience felt a little rushed.

The set-up of the restaurant is designed to be rustic and homey, with a furnished upper area where snacks are served and you're invited to stay as long as you want after dinner. My friend and I arrived a little bit after doors opened, and when we were escorted to the upper level, the seats were mostly full. We had to share a standing table with a nice man who educated us on how expensive the drinks pairing was. It's okay to arrive after doors open; you'll still get to sample all the snacks! We did have to wait a good amount of time for the waiters to actually start serving us snacks, and we waited even longer to get a drink. Communication could've been better because people started heading downstairs of their own volition, and we didn't know if we were supposed to follow or wait for someone to seat us. \n\nSNACKS. Oh, how I'd love to relive those whipped scrambled eggs and shigoku oysters. The eggs were so light and refreshing, with the slight flare provided by the hot sauce. The oysters tasted like the seat. The crispy pole beans were basically tempura-fried beans with fancy sour cream, but they were delicious. Goat cheese tart was well-paired with the fig. Caviar... I honestly don't remember this dish. My taste buds were probably recovering from their fervor. \n\nI love the set-up and the ability to watch the chefs plate the food. The dexterous way they place things really shows you the effort and thought that goes into the dishes. It's almost emotionally painful to eat them because art shouldn't be consumed, only appreciated. We went up a couple times to watch the chefs work and asked them questions. They didn't really give us actual answers (in answer to where the flowers for the dishes came from, one of the chefs said they drove to Golden Gate Park and picked them), but what do I know? \n\nI noted my experience with each dish because they provide a little booklet with all the courses, so I got to feel like a pretentious food critic: \n\nSpelt & Rye Dinner Roll - Could taste the slight sourness in the butter, and it folded perfectly under my knife. When I touched the bread, my fingers just sunk in like it was a beautiful golden cloud. \n\nBeef Tartare with Tomato and Seaweed - Someone apparently hand dove for that seaweed. The tomatoes were unbelievably sweet - why don't they sell this stuff at Safeway? The meat packs a punch with every bite, and the squid ink crisps were a kind of dark saltiness that brought the whole dish together. \n\nAbalone with Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage, Mints - The sauce was Cheetos-flavored. The chef said so himself. I love Cheetos, so I can't complain when it's suddenly okay to eat Cheetos in fine dining. There were brief bursts of flavor from the herbs, which were apparently harvested by some hippie man. They punctuated the chewiness of the abalone. \n\nSummer Squash (cold soup with mussels, beans, nasturtium) - Cold soup done right. The sharp bite of mint and coolness of the squash made me feel like I was inhaling a garden. The mussel is the very special center of the dish, and it's packed with flavor from all the sauces that it got dunked in before being placed into the plate. \n\nFresh Corn Grits - This one wasn't too impressive. I couldn't taste the truffles, and the corn was almost overwhelmingly sweet. \n\nAged Squab with Blueberry, Chanterelle, Sumac - Super rustic. It brings out memories of forests and food cooked in the midst of fires. There's a smokiness contained within the meat. Also, there was an edible twig. Where else can you eat branches and have it be called fine dining? \n\nGrilled Lamb - This one was pretty basic, but still delicious. A lamb chop covered in aromatic pine leaves that was so tender. This one broke the pattern because the pine leaves were unfortunately not edible. \n\nHuckleberry - The transition between main courses and dessert, this one was mostly muted flavors punctuated by the taste of huckleberry. \n\nWhite Chocolate with Laurel, Fennel, Honey, Chamomile - This went really well with the white tea I ordered, and it just brimmed with wildflowers. A little too sweet for me, but I loved the floral-scented cream inside and the drizzle of honey. \n\nTreats: Honey beehive... I'll eat honey up no matter what. This one had that great texture where it's crispy and gives beneath your teeth, but then it clumps up and you can suck on it for a bit to get all the flavor. \n\nOverall, I love the humor of this place and the appreciation for nature that comes through in all its dishes. I wish I didn't feel that treatment of us wasn't the same because we didn't fit into the same class as the other diners. Side note: if you order tea/coffee/any drink they offer at the end of dinner, you will be charged. Enjoy your time at this place and take it slow!

After starting you off on hor d'oeuvres and cocktails upstairs, they sit you down on communal tables (be prepared to socialize with strangers) with an open kitchen.  The staff are quick, accommodating, and more importantly, engaging.  In fact, there is no boundary between the dining room and the kitchen and they encourage people to chat with the chefs as they are plating and ask questions.  One of my friends asked jokingly if he could taste one of the desserts again and they actually whipped up a second serving of that course just for him!

They even include a booklet of the menu to allow the diners to take notes on the food as you go along (I won't lie; I ended up getting so excited that my booklet is now heavily annotated).  \nYou can tell that the chefs have put a lot of thought into each dish- from the different textures to add mouth-feel to a dish to adding sour green apples to counter creamy cheese, every dish was well composed and executed.\n\nThey change the menu daily, but the menu we got was the following:\n// (Snack) Whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, and hot sauce -- Sturgeon toast with caviar and cauliflower on pumpernickel -- Shigoku oyster with winter citrus creme and chili -- Crispy maitake mushroom with creme fraiche 'n' allium dip (their take on Sour Creme and Onion)\n// Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll- they have special cultured butter that tastes more like cheese from age; I ate most of it even though I hate butter.

Luckily and thankfully, the chefs were able to whip up alternatives but I'd hate to see someone be unlucky\n2) Come with people who are adventurous with food- the whole point is that you try new things and learn to appreciate it; the chef won't made modifications just because you don't like an ingredient (unless it's because of an allergy)\n3) Come when you are in a sociable mood- with the cocktails/ hor d'oeuvres period and communal tables, Lazy Bear recommends that you mingle with the other parties (and even include a section in the booklet to write down contact information for new friends) \n\nIf you are looking for a dinner experience that you've never EVER had in your life, Lazy Bear should be included at top of your wishlist.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-01-12"}, {"excerpts": ["From the treats before dinner to the dinner itself, great times spent from the step through the door all the way til we exit.

But I will say that, for the fairly generous portions that are served, this restaurant provides both quantity and quality.\n\nThe snacks:\nSnack #1: whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, and hot sauce\nSnack #2: albacore with aji amarillo on a rice cracker\nSnack #3: caviar with sour cream & onion wrapped in potato (it's like the best potato chip evolution you'll ever taste)\nSnack #4: hot sweetbreads with pickled watermelon\nSnack #5: Concord grape soda with lemon verbena\n\nThe menu:\nDish #1: matsutake & juniper broth\nDish #2: spelt & rye dinner roll with house cultured butter (soft as a baby's bum, that roll)\nDish #3: summer minestrone with parmigiano custard, legumes, tomato water, and tomato leaf (+ cucumbers! gorgeous presentation, amazing textures)\nDish #4: lamb tartare with sunflower and its seeds, pear, and sumac (unsure if sunflower petals were meant to be eaten)\nDish #5: trout with corn, chanterelle, green tomato, brown butter (fav)\nDish #6: lobster mushroom with Feuilles de Brik, lobster, celtuce, sauce Americaine, spinach (\"not enough lobster\" hahaha)\nDish #7: duck breast with braised and fermented greens, pluot, foie gras, amaranth (holy moly, fav)\nDish #8: Miyazaki ribeye cap with tomato, black garlic, eggplant (marbling on-point...sir, could I please have some more?)\nDish #9: fig with brown rice and fig leaf\nDish #10: potato with cashew, vanilla, and chicory\nDish #11: treats of Vietnamese coffee semifreddo, rose & hibiscus beet macaron, and red berries red velvet (was underwhelmed by the desserts sadface)\n\nSuch a memorable evening for so many reasons.

Even though I was sad to see the pop up go (and even sadder to see the free corkage go), I knew I had a chance once they opened up their brick and mortar. Finally on Thursday, November 20th, I got to try Lazy Bear!\n\nTickets run $120 per person plus tax and a mandatory 20% tip. I actually don't mind the ticketing system. It's less of a shock when your bill is split into the food and then the drinks later. You just have to commit since tickets are not refundable.\n\nThe evening started upstairs in their loft area with drinks and snacks. I decided to start the night with the Walnut manhattan: whiskey, nardini amaro, house nocino, bitters ($9). A nice dark boozy drink for a cold rainy evening. They were also serving an alcoholic punch upstairs with gin and some other ingredients I can't remember. This cocktail was free and very light.\n\nSnacks:\n*Whipped scrambled eggs: bacon, maple, hot sauce\n*Shigoku oyster: granny smith gelee, dill oil, dashi\n*Duck liver mousse: concord grape, toast, walnut\n*Blue cheese custard: carrot ham\n\nThe snacks were great! I loved all of them. The whipped eggs were light, fluffy and had a nice kick. The oyster went well with the tart apple. The duck liver mousse and blue cheese custard were both creamy and full of flavor. So good!\n\nTasting menu:\n*Dutch crunch pain epi: cultured butter\n*Bay scallops: mandarin yogurt, juniper, chicories\n*Dungeness crab: persimmon, chesnut, brussels sprouts, brown butter\n*Matsutake: douglas fir, scallion, kohlrabi\n*Grilled pork: jowl and loin, frilly red mustard, asian pear, squash, pepitas\n*Duck: cabbages, cracklins, barley, buckwheat, chanterelles, duck jus\n*Avocado: raw and candied citrus, yuzu buttermilk\n*Parsnip: coffee, cocoa, egg yolk\n*Treats\n\nI didn't enjoy the tasting menu as much as the snacks. The bread was an okay first course, but I normally don't eat a lot of bread at dinner. The highlight of the menu were the two seafood courses. I loved the scallops and crab. The scallops were fresh and the mandarins offered a nice contrast. The crab was probably my fav. Tender and sweet. My least favorite dish was the matsutake. It smelled wonderful when it came out, but had too much of an earthy flavor to it. I didn't care for that dish. The rest were good, but nothing really compared to the deliciousness of the snacks.\n\nWine pairing ($65):\n*Loureiro, quinta do ameal, vinho verde, Portugal 2012\n*Chenin blanc, chappellet, napa valley, California 2013\n*Pinot noir, robert sinskey, los carneros, napa valley, California 2011\n*Grenache: miner family, hudson vineyard, napa valley, California 2012\n*Moscato d'asti docg, vignaioli di s stefano, effervescent, 2013\n*Porto, taylor's, 20 year old, tawny\n\nI decided to partake in the wine pairing. All wines went well with the courses. Basically every 1-2 dishes were paired with a different wine. My gf didn't do the wine pairing so she ended up getting the Cabernet sauvignon, neyers, conn valley, napa valley, California 2010 ($20 glass).\n\nI also got a Buttermilk flip: henry mckenna bourbon, house buttermilk, farm egg, maple. Guessing this was an accident, but I can't say no to free booze! To end the meal, I ordered a Double espresso. Not sure if espresso is included, but I wasn't charged for it.\n\nThey give you cute little books stating all the snacks and courses which I loved. Great little souvenir to bring home. I'm honestly not a huge fan of communal seating, but the couples we sat next to were nice and fun. I don't know if the brick and mortar takes away from the pop up feel of Lazy Bear.

Fortunately, my friend scored tickets just as they were released and I was invited to join in on the fun along with Nina Y.. I think the ~$130/pp we paid seems a bit high but think of it as a dinner party experience and delicious food. We went on a Tuesday night for the first seating. We all work in the city and barted to that direction so it was pretty easy. Might be a challenge looking for parking though. \n\nPRELUDE: Front\n\nCheck in at the door. Give your name. Someone will escort you upstairs (and note: they won't forget your name)\n\nSCENE I: The upstairs gathering\n\nI recommend getting to the event early especially if you're the first seating. You definitely want to get some of the limited seating/table area upstairs if you want to be able to set plates/drinks down or, if you're a yelper like me, to get good lighting to take pictures as it is very dim. We were served five amuse bouches (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). They were little interesting bites. I actually liked the whipped scrambled eggs a lot in their simplicity of ingredients but complexity of texture! Also, as I was allergic to cucumber (p.s. they are great about food allergies) they allowed me to substitute the punch of a glass of champagne.\n\nSCENE II: Downstairs\n\nCan my dining room look like this? It's very modern decor (Imagine somewhere Eames chairs would fit but with more warmth and character). Everyone had assigned seating which you don't have to find yourself (they bring you there). Our fellow diners were cheerful and we exchanged hellos (but no obligation here to make new friends). They provide you with a small notebook and pencil allowing you to jot down notes about your dishes as the chef describes it or as you eat it. Also between courses you are encouraged to get up, walk around, observe the chefs cooking/plating (from a distance), and even ask them questions! It's an open kitchen.\n\nList of Dishes (I'll just say everything is amazing and highlight any fun facts):  Valentine's bread, \nSweet Pea Custard (This had salmon roe, I mentally told myself it wouldn't work, but it did. This was a mouthful of Spring), Charred Onion Broth (Egg yolk and pork fat. The depth of flavor was soul warming). Halibut (One of the chefs gave us their brining ratio and preparation method with sous vide). Rabbit (Served with snails that they raised and had been fed only with basil -- how long does that even take? I swear I tasted the basil). Lamb (on the bone with the right amount of fat). Rhubarb (an icy sorbet). Oats financier (yum. It was served with granola that reminded me of campfires and coffee).  Final Treats (5 different classic pastry chef deserts like a macaron and cream puff). \n\nFINI\n\nFood: There's a story behind every dish. David Barzelay (Owner/Head Chef) is fun and not too polished. He also allows every one of his chefs to express their creativity and lead on a course (including providing a brief intro the dish). \n\nService: Very professional. Each one of their seatings is a carefully choreographed party. The servers were very attentive. The chefs and kitchen staff were fun and friendly. We even took a picture at the end (unknowingly with all the folks having a blast behind us -- I guess we were the serious ones?) \n\nOverall: If you can go, do it. I'm not sure if its worth the premium to have it on a weekend night (what are you doing for 2-3 hours on a weekday night anyway?) as they serve the same food throughout.

The hard part was finding the balance to have enough butter for the pieces of bread. \n\nWine: The wine ordered was not too big and a bit light in taste. By itself, I wouldn't have liked it but for this meal, it did well as a background player. Coming in when needed but confident and dependable to downplay it's role so the food can shine. \nThe beef tartare with tomato was good and finely displayed. Next was the sturgeon & caviar. Apparently this was topped with a ton of caviar. I have plans to buy a jar and sit in pjs on my birthday with a glass of champagne and watch tv. Last was the monterey abalone. It was lightly salted and the meat was cut up into manageable small bites allowing all the other greens to mix in with the fine meat.\n\nThe aged squab with huckleberry, chanterelle, and sumac was perfectly done. The meat was tender but didn't tear apart during the cut. Mushrooms and berries brought an earthy tartness to the taste- and to bring forth more of that dark forest feel, there was a 'twig' that was prepared and lightly coated with dark chocolate powder reminding me more of earth and dirt. But yummy. \n\nNow the star of the show: the Wagyu Ribeye. How have I lived thus far without consuming more of this divine goodness? The experience was otherworldly. Before even cutting into the perfectly marbled meat, I hear soft gasping exclamations of, \"oh my God!\" down the long table. The Wagyu was from Miyazaki Prefecture, prepared with sunflower, sunchoke, and bradsicas on the side. Of course. I imagine this cow's life full of sunshine and happiness. Living in spoiled relaxations- days full of massages and beer with flowers behind it's ears. I've never seen such beautiful and even marblelizations. From the outside crust to the pink marbled meat, this plate deserves to be loved. This was worth it and this was happiness. I was sad when it was over. More please. \n\nTo clean our palette after that decadent love affair with the Wagyu, we begrudgingly enjoyed a cucumber salad of sort. It was fresh and unassuming- like a reminder for us to slowly get back to earth and continue on. Then first desserts came out w concord grape and buttered icecream. They do amazing things with butter here, folks. Don't be lactose intolerant.\n\nSecond dessert came with treats. Strawberry pate de fruit. Yums pate. Beehive pavlova and s'more. It was a perfect ending to our meal. The little checkered notepad contains everything we've eaten and the pencils provided were for taking notes. Thank you to my two loves for experiencing this with me. You are always great wonderful company and now synonymous with 'good eats'. \n\nWould I come here again? Yes. The menu changes every two weeks depending on what's in season. The atmosphere was warm and classy, the dining staff were all knowledgeable, helpful, professional, and extremely friendly. The food without a doubt is top of the line. The chefs are all top tier and sweet. Overall, the experience was worth every pretty penny. Good job, Lazy Bear. You did fantastic. \n\nLove,\n\nJodie", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-12-06"}, {"excerpts": ["For dessert, we absolutely enjoyed the small treats at the end that included a semifreddo with Vietnamese coffee.  "], "author": "Lisa I.", "review": "By now, Lazy Bear is no longer the underground thing that initially made it popular.  After reading about it in national magazines, it's clear that Lazy Bear has made a name for itself using the unique experience of going to a fancy dinner party with friends.  In buying the tickets for a 2 person seating a month ahead, I was a little pensive about what to expect.  The tickets aren't cheap, and there's no option to peruse any menu before then, so it requires a lot of upfront commitments. Scary, I know.\n\nAs everyone's already raved about, the appetizers that are served up in the mezzanine area before dinner are on point.  The whipped scrambled eggs are the popular item, but there were some seriously amazing drinkable starters like the cucumber soda. Finding another group to talk to was a little awkward, so most people seem to keep to themselves leading up to being seated at the tables.\n\nUpon seating, you're presented with one more appetizer and then the super handy notebook that serves as your guide throughout dinner.  I took a few notes on each of the dishes the entire evening, and it's been incredibly helpful in reliving the entire evening.  Dishes were provided at a reasonable pace, and what I found a little interesting was how quickly your plates were cleared once you were done eating.  My husband and I got into talking to the couple next to us, and what I find to be absolutely incredible is how Lazy Bear seems to facilitate the coming together of other \"foodies.\" Some of the dishes that really stood out to us were the amazing and high quality cuts of protein we received, and the flavor profiles of both the sweet and savory dishes.  My favorite thing I ate that night was a Tomato Panzanella that had a thinly sliced piece of wagyu on top.  My husband's favorite was the pork shoulder that came garnished with stone fruit and almonds.  For dessert, we absolutely enjoyed the small treats at the end that included a semifreddo with Vietnamese coffee.  Talk about a flavor bomb!\n\nService wise, everyone was extremely accommodating.  The process of explaining each dish before eating it was helpful, as was the explanation that came with each of the drinks covered under the wine pairing. The whole experience felt tailored in a way that was meant for you to enjoy as much as possible with very few concerns along the way. I definitely recommend having a meal with Lazy Bear, especially if you're into something that's a newfangled concept that involves the love of food, delicious fare, and quality service.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["As treats (aka. dessert), there were semifreddo, caramelized apricot, and red velvet chocolate.

Luckily, we were provided with a field guide to note our thoughts on the food items to reflect at a later time, which is exactly what I'm doing! It was my first time doing this sort of tasting menu and I was fascinated at how everything was run from the upstairs appetizer/drinks area to desserts. \n\nAs snacks, there were whipped scrambled eggs (3), shigoku oyster (2), foie gras (1), cucumber soda (5), an caviar (4). I've added my ranking in parentheses. The foie gras created a strawberry pop as it melted in my mouth; I still remember the taste of it even though I've forgotten the others. The cucumber soda tasted like one of my detox juices and just clashed with everything, especially my drink.\n\nThe dishes came out in the order below:\n-Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll\n-Tomato Panzanella\n-Legumes\n-Celtuce Stem & Leaves\n-Fresh Corn Grits\n-Grilled Berkshire Pork Shoulder\n-Miyazaki Ribeye Cap\n-White Sesame\n-Blue Corn\n\nOnce again, I don't remember the taste of most of these too well but loved the fresh corn grits, which is funny considering I don't even like gritty textured food very much. I believe the chef mentioned that they only used corn and duck ham to go on top. Extremely rich in flavor and delicious. I also put a checkmark for Tomato Panzanella, which probably meant I liked it. :) \n\nAs treats (aka. dessert), there were semifreddo, caramelized apricot, and red velvet chocolate. Absolutely loved them, especially the semifreddo. \n\nThe timing of the food entrances, music playlist, and service could have been a bit better. I think at one point they started playing Trap Queen. Overall, I loved the experience but was confused at people obsessing over every bite; I don't think everything was necessarily *amazing*. (Like the dinner roll and butter, which was quite average.) I'd recommend eating without the assumption that every bite will be glorifying, because it probably won't be. I'd also recommend not drinking very much alcohol since it will mess with the taste and intended experience of the dishes.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Rounding out the desserts was a selection of treats: chili rose macaron topped with togarashi, negroni gelee, toasted s'more, a caramel wrapped in edible rice paper and walnut mousse cake. "], "author": "Monica S.", "review": "For my dining companion's special birthday, I chose to celebrate at LB because not only was the food rated highly, but the restaurant was noted for its dinner-party-like atmosphere. Not only do I enjoy dinner parties, but it's my preferable way to entertain guests in my home.\n\nWhen I booked the reservation, which was easy to do after I read the page of instructions, I paid $156.60/person with my credit card. At the time of dining, you can decide if you want to add the wine pairing or mixed pairing for $65/person. If you do decide to add the pairing, a 20% tip is added and the total comes out to $84.83 with tax. Now that the shocking finances are out of the way, I can move on to the fun stuff.\n\nAs all the reviews mentioned, you start out upstairs with complimentary low alcohol punch, which tastes herbal and medicinal. Spacing upstairs is limited so the early bird gets the worm (or chair as in this case). Because the atmosphere is supposed to be dinner-party-like, my dining companion and I began talking to the people around us. However, people are shy and we had to dig for common ground. Eventually, we found another couple celebrating a birthday and found commonality with them while being served whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, hot sauce, shigoku oyster with citrus kosho froth (my photo came out grainy due to the low lighting), a platter of duck liver mousse with marmalade, duck confit hushpuppy, with black lime, duck rillette which is the quince fruit roll-up, and duck Slim Jim with sour cream and herbs. The last of the appetizers was a bowl of bone marrow and cheddar fondue (more like a broth) served with crudit\u00e9s. Out of the appetizers, the scrambled eggs served in a shot glass was my favorite.\n\nWhen it was time to move downstairs, the host seats you in pre-assigned seating. Hoping we would get to sit with the couple we had met upstairs, I was sorely disappointed when we were seated next to a  couple who didn't want to interact with us at all. Luckily, the restaurant welcomes you to move around, so the guests are encouraged to get out of their seats to observe the kitchen, talk with the chefs and staff, take pictures, write notes in the provided booklet so we weren't stuck with the unsociable couple who only wanted to talk between themselves and their phone. Uggh!\n\nCultured butter which tastes like cheese accompanied the brown butter brioche which was served first. Afterwards, the sorrel salad containing garden herbs, spot prawn, geoduck clam, barley, and miner's lettuce arrived and was challenging to eat because it contained 3 snails which our chef announced were fed only basil and then braised for a couple of hours. See photo. Although I've had snails many times before (here and in France), I must be out of practice because they kind of freaked me out seeing them in my salad. Seeing the miner's lettuce reminded me of hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains with my daughter's pre-school class whose teacher would pick up various items along the trail for the class to touch or eat....like miner's lettuce. When the charred onion broth was served with Tennessee Ham, an egg yolk, pea-sized apple balls, and scallion, the chef's description of the egg yolk was fascinating. A raw egg yolk is set in 67\u00b0F oil overnight to \"cure\" it. After hot broth is poured over the yolk, you can cut it in half and it still keeps its shape and has lots of flavor. \n\nAfter the starters the saffron lobster was served with rice grits which was very much like risotto made with lobster broth. Interestingly, the chips that accompanied this dish were made from spot prawn roe that were dehydrated, mixed with rice then dehydrated again, then lightly fried. When the grilled squab arrived, I was not only excited about the squab itself, which I hadn't eaten since I was a little girl in Mexico, but it was served with foie gras which was banned (but recently lifted) in CA for several years much to my dismay. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. Mixing things up a bit, the wagyu ribeye arrived with a Thai coconut green curry sauce. Admittedly, the beef wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth as I had hoped, but still the combo was amazing. \n\nEnding the meal with a variety of sweets is my kind of meal. Creatively served with creme anglaise, cream cheese, sparkling water and fennel was an all carrot plate: pressed dried carrot, carrot granita and carrot boba. Following the vegetable dessert was the sticky toffee pudding with a brown butter sorbet, walnut brittle, and sweetened creme fraiche. Rounding out the desserts was a selection of treats: chili rose macaron topped with togarashi, negroni gelee, toasted s'more, a caramel wrapped in edible rice paper and walnut mousse cake.

It's a bit confusing, I guess even after you figure it out it seems mostly obvious that most nights you cannot make reservations for 4 or maybe larger than 4. Big-ger parties are definitely a no go. The location is fine, parking is *ok* but don't expect to have an easy time with that either.\n\nThe tickets were very expensive. Between the processing fees and the dinner and some other fees it was almost $330 for two people.

I definitely feel like this is a product of the fact that they have to pay for a brick & mortar location and that probably comes with a host of renting costs and other licenses.

One sneaky part though, you don't know that the restaurant is there until you walk up close to the door and see the logo. The place is painted black on the outside with a stripe of red and black checkered design - love the sneakiness though :)\n\nArrived at 8pm for the second seating for 2. We were brought upstairs and started off with a Tequila Punch. People there were already taking advantage of the communal experience. My boyfriend and I ordered the Almanac beer (sour) and the Flight of Beer during our wait for our seating. While we waited, we were offered hors d'oeuvres!\n- Whipped Scrambled Eggs: This came in what looks like a double-shot shot glass with foamy egg at the top & a kick of spiciness at the bottom with bacon bits and chives all over. Very tasteful!\n- Albacore: Peanut, grape & black olive under a small piece of albacore - this had an interesting texture when you eat it all in one bite, but surprisingly good altogether.\n- Foie Gras: Usually not a fan of foie gras, but you don't taste that usual gamey taste when it was on top of a strawberry cracker & sorrel! \n- Caviar: The potato chip exterior that wraps the caviar with sour cream was also one of my favorite hors d'oeuvres of the evening!\n- Hot Sweetbreads: A bit too spicy for me (can't really handle spicy) but it was very tasty! I thought it was a piece of chicken but was surprised that it was fried bread with pickled watermelon on top - which helped with the spiciness.\n- Concord Grape Soda: We got this cute grape soda in a tiny chemistry-theme glassware with a tiny water straw when we got seated. Had a hint of gingery taste to it, so I didn't like that, but it wasn't overbearing so not bad.\n\nGot escorted to our assigned seating & waiting was a cute field guide notebook with a pencil! As a designer, this was awesome! It had the date printed on it with all the dishes for us to write notes! Love! We were able to walk up to the kitchen & see the chefs decorate and work. The aesthetics were amazing & so particular. I also did think it was fancy for them to fold up my napkin & tidy up my seat everytime I walked away - talk about amazing service! Main courses:\n- Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll: From the butter to the bread, they made this themselves. Warm & toasty. A bit on the saltier side but I still gobbled it up because it was yummy.\n- Tomato Panzanella: One of the dishes that stood out to me most with a thin carpaccio of Miyazaki Ribeye above a layer of avocado, padron conserva & seaweed focaccia. Cutting each bit with all items in one spoonful had so much texture & taste, that I wanted MORE! \n- Legumes: Summer squash, bell, pepper, fennel, and saffron nage all in one with a buttery foamy sauce around it just made everything mesh so well together. Each legume was sweet on its own & mixed with the buttery sauce just topped it off for me :)\n- Celtuce Stem & Leaves: common Chinese veggie, but the way they made this was different from how I'd eat at home. The took the inside of the celtuce & kept it crunchy without overcooking & topped it with almond and chicken skin bits for extra flavor - I would have been happy with the celtuce stem itself, but the bits they added on top put it on another level!\n- Fresh Corn Grits: OMG CORN! They cooked the flavor of the corn just perfectly because all of the corn taste was just perfectly there! I am a huge fan of corn and I gobbled this up wanting and craving more! They had a bit of what looked like proscuitto on top which tasted good with the corn, but on its own it was salty. Man do I miss this delightful taste!\n- Grilled Berkshire Pork Shoulder: The fatty part of this pork was sweet & yummy. Different that it was cooked with grilled peach, turnip, succulents, & stonefruit tare - but they went  surprisingly good with the savory taste of the juicy pork.\n- Mizyaki Ribeye Cap: Mmm.. how i love wagyu! This was probably why our meal costed so much but I loved every bit of this fatty meat! It was cooked at perfect melt-in-my-mouth-ness and paired with tomatoes, black garlic, and eggplant - boy would I want some more of this right now! \n- White Sesame: This was probably my least favorite of the night, IF i had to choose one. Subtle & not too sweet of a sesame pudding with bits of green melon & sake.\n- Blue Corn: One of my top! Who would of thought kettle corn and, blueberry ice cream & cake would go so well together!

However, when we got there, the majority of people were already there and seated at all the nice seats upstairs. Instead, we were at a high ball table towards the center. While we were sitting there, the waitress moved us a little bit to make room, but there just wasn't enough room. I definitely was a little put out by it. \n\nWe got a delicious punch when we first got up there and also got 5 different dishes up there. (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). All of those were delicious. I think my favorite was the scrambled eggs was the most creative (a little bit of spice at the bottom was delicious). The foie gras was probably my favorite overall because I just love foie. \n\nThen we moved downstairs and had: \nMadre's Reviver: OH MY GOD. So delicious of a drink. The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones. None of them were amazing like the first dessert, but they were all really good. (caramel sesame cream puff, frozen smore, sangria jelly, coconut caramel, and black forest macaron.)\n\nThe overall experience was great. The servers were so attentive and always folded the napkins when we left the table. They always served us together as well. So great!\n\nOverall, such a great experience. Definitely one of those things you could do every so often (like once a season or so). \n\nProtip: get tickets at noon when they open up.

For the first 30-40 min, you start out upstairs. When you walk in, they give you some mulled wine to warm you up. (*=favorites)\n\nSome of my favorite dishes were from the \"Snacks\" we had upstairs.\n1. *Whipped scrambled eggs: a sous vided egg, whipped so it's light and airy, served in a small tall glass. The bacon made it smoky, and their house hot sauce and the maple syrup at the bottom made it an awesome breakfast like dish.\n2. Kumamoto oyster: with granny smith apple froth and fennel pollen \n3. Caviar: with a smoky sourdough puree and a sourdough crisp. I love caviar\n4. Duck liver mousse: on a graham cracker with cranberries, herbs; I liked the graham cracker\n5. Sea buckthorn soda: They juiced it and made a syrup from the musk, with foam on top. Unique, but I didn't love it \n\nDownstairs: seating at long tables\n1. *Toasted brassica infused broth: the broth was very light and clean, and there were pieces of cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, pickled turnips, fried kale \n2. Spelt and rye dinner roll: their version of a Parker house roll with spelt and rye for nuttiness, topped with brown butter salt. I love salt. Their house cultured butter uses buttermilk with cultures carried forward for 3 years now. It was cheesy and tangy\n3. *Bay scallop: from New England, served raw.  The shell held a satsuma and pine oil citronette that you pour over the dish. It was topped with pine tips, fresh mandarin oranges, partially dehydrated mandarin orders, succulents, buddha's hand, and a meyer lemon zest.  The pine and buttermilk panna cotta underneath was really smooth. I never thought pine could go into a dish, but this one balanced a lot of random ingredients together really well\n4. *Sunchoke: all the parts of a sunflower. There was a sunchoke puree with cheese, sunflower petals, sunflower sprouts, and sunflower seeds. the jus was made of sunchoke and chicken.  The stand out was actually the sweetbreads (sauteed in butter, garlic, lemon juice, fried). The texture and flavor were really good. The egg yolk confit was more like a fudge texture than runny. It was a very creative and interesting dish\n5. *Butterball potatoes: potatoes that were only 2 weeks old, super tender, almost like gnocchi?, super sweet and creamy. It came with green garlic, stinging nettles, chantarelles, crispy seaweed, crispy nettles. On the bottom was a German butterball potato-sea lettuce-nettle puree. I didn't know I could enjoy potatoes so much\n6. Sonoma county duck: a sausage made from the legs and wrapped in collard greens (good flavor), quince roasted in duck fat (with cinnamon, black pepper, ginger), and the duck breast. The breast is aged in house for 7 days, so it ferments and tastes almost like ham.\n7. Pork belly: from Sonoma. Brined for 24 hours, braised for 40 hours to tenderize it, and they did a good job of rendering out the fat.  It came with fresh and smoked beet juice with apple cider and a green apple + onion soubise. Various sorrels (wood, French, red vein) and mustard greens added earthiness. The smoked beets were also really good with the pork belly\n8. Hazelnut: coffee ice cream with candied meyer lemon peel (loved this lemon peel with the hazelnut and coffee). It also had a brown rice pudding cooked in toasted hazelnut milk, cocoa crisps, hazelnut coffee, and a brown butter puree. This was a pretty interesting take on hazelnut (ie not just hazelnut and chocolate)\n9. Persimmon: Hachiya semifreddo (I prefer ice cream), salt roasted fuyu (encased in salt and compressed, pretty salty), pickled persimmon puree. Then there was a malted sponge cake (subtle). The root beer pudding w/malted milk and tempered chocolate tasted like a whopper!\n\nFinal Treats: \n1. *Vietnamese coffee: frozen vietnamese coffee covered in white chocolate and on top of a chocolate cookie \n2. Chocolate bonbon: with pine and yuzu, topped with fleur de sel. I liked the yuzu and how they rounded out the meal with more pine\n3. Macaron: a half macaron with cayenne, cinnamon pear, caramel\n\nOf the wine pairings, the most interesting ones were the blanc de blanc, the Nebbiolo, the pinot, and the sparkling tokaji at the end. Our sommelier told us a lot of interesting stuff behind each of the wines. We also tried some cocktails (they have a full liquor license now.)\n\nI love the open kitchen, and you're allowed to go over and look and talk to the chefs.  They encourage you to talk to the people sitting next to you, but it wasn't as communal as I thought it would be (I don't love communal dining).

Pretty tasty to start and was served to us along side the appitizers.\n\nShiso Old Fashioned: Had this during the 2nd part of the dinner and it was just OK.  A bit too sweet and couldn't really taste too much of the Shiso.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs infused with bacon and house made hot sauce - the bacon infusion really stood out and the hot sauce wasn't too powerful, blended the flavors together quite well \n\nOlio Nuovo with milk gelato, sea salt, peach compote - nice refresher after the scrambled eggs, olive oil wasn't too strong, though my girlfriend had a few coughs (means its fresh!) bits of almond had nice flavor \n\n4 part duck plate: -Liver Mousse - Hushpuppy - Slim Jim - Rillette - \n- Mousse was amazing, had great taste with a bit of funky duck after taste, Rillette  was nice but needed more texture, hushpuppy was ok, couldn't taste too much of the aioli on the plate, slim jim had a bit of a kick to it and a bit salty\n\nDashi braised abalone chowder - SOOOOO GOOD, really helped with the spiciness of the slim jim, topped with potato chips and chive oil brought everything together, best part of the appetizers.\n\nMAIN DISHES:\n\nBrown Butter Bread: I suppose this too is an appetizer but was the first dish we tried, cultured butter with brown butter on the side.

It wasn't too memorable\n\nParsnip sous vide  with chocolate meringue and bite of devils cake - Personally my least favorite part of the dinner, there were two types of chocolate cake with the dish, devils and another one that was just a very hard piece of cake. It's meant to mash together with everything but it didn't take like anything in particular. \n\nParting Treats:\n\nYuzu PoppySeed Macaron - it was kind of hard to eat, but the yuzu really stood out\n\nSaffron Caramel - very sticky, had good taste to it but couldn't eat the whole bite \n\nNegroni Jelly - great interpretation of the Negroni cocktail. Very delish.\n\nPistachio Cake - Good ender to the entire meal, light and made you wanting more.\n\nAll in all the Meal was quite great.

First of all, can't believe I was able to get tickets.  Guess that was the advantage of buying tickets for Outside Lands weekend.  Anyway, Lazy Bear exceeded expectations and the well-deserved hype that surrounds it.\n\nWe arrived around 8 and were escorted upstairs to the mezzanine area.  We were promptly served some delicious punch. I'm usually not a cocktail person, but this was yum; some sort of lemon-vodka-aloe thing.  We were served several delicious \"snacks\".  We got the beverage pairing, so started with a glass of champagne (don't remember the name since they ran out of the original one, they gave us a bit of an upgrade--yay!).  Was a lot of fun watching the food prep from above, excellent birds-eye view.\n\nSnacks started with whipped scrambled eggs, which is apparently one of their standard items; would definitely make sure you get your spoon all the way to the bottom of the glass to get the delicious hot sauce and maple syrup to mix in with the eggs.  Next snack was albacore marinated in kalamata olives.  Now I'm generally not in favor of eating foie gras due to how it's made, but I made an exception for Lazy Bear.  It was served with strawberry and sorel and was buttery delicious.  Next snack was my favorite, a crispy potato wrapped around creme fraiche and caviar, kind of like a fancy Pringle, yum!  The final snack was fried sweetbreads with pickled watermelon that had some nice spice to it; cannot go wrong with something fried, especially the way they made it.\n\nWhen the snacks were done, each couple or group was escorted one by one down to their seats at one of the two 20-person tables.  We were lucky to get one of the seats up front, so had a decent view of some of the food prep.  We were served a refreshing little \"grape soda\" that was more like a mini smoothie, served as a palate cleanser.  For each course, one of the chefs came out to describe the components and prep.  Sommelier poured the wine for those who got the beverage course.  I found the descriptions to be really interesting and fun, without a bit of pretension.\n\nFirst course was delicious spelt & rye dinner roll with their house cultured butter.  Absolutely delicious.  Next course was one of our favorites of the night:  tomato panzanella with beef carpaccio (wagyu beef) with avocado, padron conserva, and seaweed foccacia.  Melt in your mouth goodness with some crispiness of the focaccia, amazing flavors!  Next was the legumes course, with snap peas, grean beens, wax beens in a butter and bell pepper relish.  The next course included a vegetable that I think most hadn't heard of before:  celtuce stem & leaves, a veggie whose stem was kind of like asparagus, but different flavor and consistency; anyway, was interesting and delicious.  Then came the fresh corn grits topped with duck ham.  It was the wonderful simplicity of corn and butter, and the duck ham kinda tasted like prosciutto.  Next came the grilled Berkshire pork shoulder with peaches, turnips, succulents, and stonefruit; juicy goodness!  The final meat course was some delicious wagyu ribeye cap with tomato, black garlic, and eggplant.\n\nThree dessert courses were served next.  The first was a very interesting and super tasty white sesame tofu, green melon, sake, and rose geranium. Next came a delicious mix of blue corn masa, blueberry ice cream and fresh blueberries, with a whiskey based sauce or pudding.  The evening ended with a trio of treats:  caramelized apricot with hazelnut and milk chocolate, red velvet cake with berries, and semifreddo Vietnamese coffee.  \n\nOverall, this was such a unique experience.  The food and service were top notch.  This could have easily been a snooty place, but it was quite the opposite.  All of the chefs, servers, and sommelier were so nice and seemed to be so genuinely in love with what they do.

People are seated in two long wooden tables but once again I'm not the biggest fan of communal dining.

The brioche was perfectly buttery, with the brown butter adding a nutty tone. The cultured butter was also incredible - its aged for 2 years, adding a really sharp note.\n\nNext we had a dish with four different types of sorrels, basil-fed snails from Napa, near-raw spot prawns, geoduck clams, and barley that had been crisped in oil - solid salad-type entree. Then a charred onion and ham broth soup with a perfectly poached egg yolk, pickled apple, and scallion. Unfortunately my soup didn't come with the pickled apple.\n\nThen the mains - we had a butter-poached lobster cooked with saffron in a lobster reduction sauce  (my favorite dish of the night!) This was followed by squab with foie gras and pear. I was a big fan of the squab as well (probably my second favorite dish), the pairing of pear with the richness of the foie gras worked really well and the crispy skin of the squab was seared perfectly. After the squab was a wagyu ribeye marinated in Vietnamese-style fish sauce with this Thai-style lemongrass sauce - tasty, but I wasn't that impressed.\n\nThen the desserts - honestly these were the biggest disappointment of the evening mostly because they added hot sauce to dishes that I felt didn't need it. First, we had a yummy kiwi-based palate cleanser with buttermilk panna cotta, guava jelly, and meringue. This was followed by a sticky toffee pudding that was tasty if not for the the shock at tasting hot sauce accompanying the creme fraiche, butter sorbet, and toffee/date/walnut-y cake. They then brought out a presentation of small treats - a rose-flavored macaron (once again, dusted with spicy powder), a caramel (my favorite of the desserts), a campari jelly, ice cream sandwich, and mocha cream cake bite.

Took 30 minutes to find a space in a garage 5 blocks away.\n\nTicketing for Lazy Bear is really where the issues begin and go on and on: The difficulty getting tickets due to limited batch at a time, online releases which sell out within an hour is what drives the hype, but the dining experience itself didn't live up to it. This concert ticket release model ( as well the rest of Lazy Bear's concept) is borrowed from Grant Aschatz' celebrated Alinea in Chicago which earns it's continued success, not through the concert ticket hype, but because the food is exquisite in execution and presentation: Aschatz is a gifted and visionary chef with years of experience training both as sous chef under Thomas Keller at his famed French Laundry and as executive chef to Rick Tramonto & Gail Gand's seminal restaurant, Trio;  a restaurant that pioneered most of the presentations seen on the plates at Lazy Bear, though sadly having very little of the same depth, clarity and incredible flavors as those of Trio's, French Laundry's or Alinea's. Unlike David Barzelay whose experience is limited to staging in a few notable San Fran restaurants and who is self taught , Grant Aschatz dedicated years training under luminary chefs and mentors, fine tuning his craft, creativity, knowledge and skill, developing his own culinary voice and paying his dues  until he was ready to strike out on his own. Alinea is a masterwork, and I'll buy tickets all day long at those high prices because you get what you pay for and come away knowing it was worth every penny as you savor the memory of every wondrously surprising delicacy that deceived and then delighted your senses. You will NOT receive anything remotely close to that at Lazy Bear, except the price tag.\n\nI admire Barzelay's entrepreneurial spirit and think he has great potential. But I grow increasingly concerned with this trend of chefs who think it's not necessary to put in the hours that it takes to master their skills and sell style over substance using hype to substitute for experience. I don't care that he's not classically trained but his lack of restaurant experience is on high display in his borrowed theme restaurant in far too many ways both front of the house and back. There were some inspired moments in our Lazy Bear dinner which included the first three amuse bouche ; whipped egg - probably the best of the evening-  fois gras mousse on brioche, and a lovely oyster. It dipped into a valley of just okay through the seated meal segment until desserts and 'treats' were served which at least ended the meal on a high note.

For 2 glasses of wine during hors d'ouvres, an out of sync pairing, a late running bottle and 10 cent service, we were charged $160 with 20% ADDED TO THE BILL. I was livid. For the beverage service ( or lack thereof) at least, I should have been able to leave a tip which reflected the service and been able to do so at MY DISCRETION\n      Bottom line. We'll never go back. When you spend $500 on a meal and are forced to pay a service charge up front ( which they insultingly try to pass off as a courtesy of not having to pay at the end ) you should receive the benefit of excellent professional table service. Or at least the courtesy of a reach around. Barring that, Lazy Bear is lazy indeed: It wants you to believe it's revolutionizing the dining experience when really, all it's doing is stripping away professional dining service and demanding to be paid for it anyway. There's some marginal, some good and sometimes even inspired food being run to the tables, but it's so inconsistent and falls so short everywhere else that in the end , it is SO not worth it.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-12-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Treats-Macarons, sesame ball with chocolate ganache, berry \"jelly\", frozen s'more, ", "sous vide caramelized cookie dough: "], "author": "Julia H.", "review": "A very memorable and unique dining experience! Similar to many of the reviews, I applied countless times when they had their lottery system but always failed to get reservations. When they came out with the new ticketing system last month, my friend was able to score us tickets for the opening weekend at their permanent brick and mortar location! YAY!\n \nTIP: Join their mailing list at lazybearsf.com and you will be notified when tickets go on sale. (mine would always end up in my spam inbox so make sure you check that).  My friend was on the ticketing page at 11:57am and bought tickets before 12! This was probably just a glitch but definitely try and maybe you'll get lucky :)\n\nEnough about the frustrating reservation process, let's talk about the experience: \n\nThe experience itself was amazing and unlike any restaurant i've been to. After being greeted by the host, we were escorted upstairs to the lounge area overlooking the communal tables and open kitchen. We were served pineapple/whiskey punch (good, but pretty strong!) and waited for the exciting evening to begin. The crowd consisted of mainly young people either on dates or with groups of friends. We saw people wearing hoodies and jeans to couples more dressed up in cocktail attire (some guys even in suits!). There is no dress code so feel free to wear whatever you want, but I would probably recommend something more casual than fancy. \n\nThe \"Snacks\" were served upstairs in a cocktail party environment where the waiters brought out each starter on a platter. These included: \n\n1.) Whipped Scramble Eggs, Bacon Maple, Hot Sauce\n2.) Damson Plum Brulee, Chicken Liver Mousse, Brioche, Sorrel\n3.) Charred Tomatillo, Beef Jerky, Creme Fraiche, Radish \n4.) Sweet Corn Custard, American White Sturgeon Caviar\n\nAll of these starters were good (mainly bite size), but my favorite would have to be the sweet corn custard. Perfect custard consistency with nice subtle flavors of sweet corn... And who wouldn't like caviar on top of that?\n\nAfter we received all the \"Snacks\", we were slowly escorted downstairs to our assigned seats around the two communal tables. Our tasting menu for September 28, 2014 consisted of: \n\n5.) Bay Laurel and Molasses Bread with Cultured Butter & Buttermilk: the bread was very moist and I liked the tangy buttermilk mixture. \n6.) Chilled Lettuce Soup with Little Gems, Summer Squash, Fried Anchovy, & Parsley: So interesting! Unique interpretation of the classic caesar salad. The flavors of the chilled soup were really good. I didn't really care for the fried anchovy though. \n7.) Delta Crawfish with Carolina Gold Rice Grits, Spot Prawn, Cucumber, & Celery: My favorite main dish of the night! I really enjoyed the crawfish salad wrapped in cucumber and the sweet bbq-like gravy. I'm usually not a fan of grits, but this was good.\n8.) Before the next plate on the menu, they brought out an extra course of crawfish roe butter (using the crawfish in the dish above) and Biscuits: I liked the salty sea flavor in the butter, but thought the biscuit was average. \n9.) Guinea Hen with Butter Bean, Chanterelles, Fines Herbes & Hen Jus: Probably my least favorite dish of the night. While the hen was very moist, I didn't think the sauce was that flavorful and there were too many beans on the plate. \n10.) Seared Sungolds, Smoked Beef Striploin, Basil, Amaranth & Tomato Raisins: I personally was not a fan of the salty smoked flavors of the meat, but I really liked the tomatoes that popped in your mouth, bursting with flavors. \n11.) Pluots, Pluot Consomme Gelee, Myoga, Ginger Curd, Shiso, Mint: Super refreshing (very gingery and minty). A nice palette cleanser before the desserts!\n12.) Sourdough, Scotch, Pears, Earl Grey, Chrysanthemum: My favorite dessert of the night. I loved the pieces of bread combined with the subtle tea flavors, asian pears, and yeast ice cream. So good!!\n13.) Treats-Macarons, sesame ball with chocolate ganache, berry \"jelly\", frozen s'more, sous vide caramelized cookie dough: All pretty good except I wasn't a fan of the sour jelly/gummy-like one. \n\nThere is no doubt that the food is extremely creative and inventive. Definitely some of the most unique combination of ingredients I've ever had. With that said, I was also disappointed with a few of the dishes and wasn't blown away like many of the reviews I've read. There were also some inconsistencies with the plating where my friend's piece of smoked beef was significantly smaller than all of ours (I would say almost half the size.) If we're paying $150+ per person, I would expect the portions to be around the same. \n\nThe menu changes frequently so it really depends on what you get when you go and if you like the ingredients that are used. My food experience can be very different from someone else's tasting menu, so keep that in mind. Overall, the service was great and I loved the unique fine dining experience. I would definitely recommend trying it if you're lucky enough to get tickets!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-10-06"}]}
