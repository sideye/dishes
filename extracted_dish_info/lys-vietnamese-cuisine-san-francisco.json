It was my turn to chose the cuisine and restaurant, so I chose Vietnamese.  Since the local Vietnamese spots serving Dungeness crab are unable to serve crab currently because of the meat's high toxicity, I had to look for other options (I had originally made reservations at PPQ Dungeness). So I chose this spot, Ly's, since it got good reviews and was easy to access for everyone.\n\nLy's was a really good decision, and we all enjoyed it.\n\nWalking in, it was clear that it's a clean space. A member of the wait staff who welcomed us was very friendly and accommodating and sat us down for a 7pm reservation. I ordered the crab paste noodle soup, and it was delicious. I never had this super for,  and I was looking for something different and authentic, something that I never had before. I asked for fresh tofu instead of the typical fried tofu that comes with the dish, and the server was happy to make that change for me. I also got it with the extra meatball, even though the waitress had recommended getting it with chicken. But I had a lot of chicken yesterday, so a meatball was a nice change of pace. Next time I would definitely consider getting it with chicken - not of the meatball wasn't good, but because the friendly waitress said that was the best / most popular preparation.\n\nWe also ordered the spring rolls with pork, which were large and flavorful. Two of my friends the ordered garlic noodles with the filet mignon and with the five spice chicken, and I would definitely consider ordering those in the future. The beef was really tender and tasty, as was the chicken. The fourth member in our party ordered the shrimp, and it was okay.

The noodles were well seasoned and you can taste the buttery flavor. \n\nThe grilled pork vermicelli came with a side of salad. The grilled pork was perfectly flavored and delicious. I actually wish that they provided a little more of the pork. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the food here. And I would definitely come back to try other dishes.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-02"}, {"excerpts": ["My boyfriend ordered the grilled pork vermicelli noodle bowl with imperial rolls ($12). "], "author": "Linda X.", "review": "5 stars for the pho here! The beef broth is AMAZING - so rich and doesn't even need any sauce to be added to it. I got the beef pho combo ($10) which came with a generous serving of brisket, meatballs, and rare beef. It only comes in one size but it was more than enough for a meal. The brisket was perfectly tender and fatty. The meatballs were delicious! Next time I'm going to get just beef pho with brisket and meatballs.\n\nThe place itself is pretty large and there was plenty of seating. The service here is ridiculously nice and attentive. The free cucumber water even tastes so refreshing! We also got the spring rolls ($7) which tasted fresh. My boyfriend ordered the grilled pork vermicelli noodle bowl with imperial rolls ($12). It was a solid dish but I would definitely recommend getting the pho instead.\n\nI'm a huge fan of this place!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-11-26"}], "grilled beef vermicelli": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered shrimp fresh spring rolls, cabbage salad,  grilled beef vermicelli and garlic noodles with 5 spice chicken and all were great!
