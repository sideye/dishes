The place was packed and there were a couple of other people waiting for a table. We stood there as the servers ignored us. We waited patiently for about 10 mins before being sat at a small table. Then we waited for quite awhile as the 4 servers walked back and forth but still not acknowledging us. Then a female server who looked grumpy came to our table and practically slammed our plates and chopsticks and tea cups down on our table. She did not say a word although I smiled and thanked her.\n\nWe had no idea who our server was. We saw one take the order of another table who came in after us. A male server finally took our order. We ordered chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, seafood won ton soup and lobster noodles. He rudely said we ordered too much. WTH!!! He's not the one paying!\n\nThe food came and our small table was cramped with all our plates. No one came to check on us. My friend had to ask for more water but was basically ignored. Then when the bill came, our server told us that the bill already included a tip. WOW!!! I saw that it included a 15% tip which was ridiculous due to their lack of service.
